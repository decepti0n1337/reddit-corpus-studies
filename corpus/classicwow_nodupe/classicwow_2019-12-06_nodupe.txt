It isn't hard though, just laborious. There's no actual difficulty involved, just a ridiculous investment of time.

I'm a dwarf rogue with almost the exact same UI layout and also enjoy Distracting horde off cliffs ..... are you me?
---
Alliance have actually learned to group up and fight back which was nice to see
---

---
Mostly impacts those who try to solo quest which is impossible in higher zones
---
I made a rather lengthy post about it. I saw massive denial then.
---
The entire post was about pops across all NA realms and how no battlegroup fudging could really mitigate it for Horde and one of, if not the first response was "please keep in mind BGs will be crossrealm".
---
You are now ready for the PVE Server experience!
---
Do you know that or is that an estimate
---
Found one....once. Died from the pile of trash surrounding it. Corpse run back thinking it’s surely gone. Rez, and Lo and behold, it’s still there! I tried range pulling some adds. Midway through the fight I Agro a third. Not looking good. I die again. Sigh. Another long corpse run back knowing full well I’ve lost my chance. I Rez again...it’s still there. Third times the charm, I kill the mobs and get to picking my prize. Midway through I see a horde riding hard in my direction and I quickly check the cast car. Almost done. He’s getting closer and....FAILED?!? I was about ready to launch my keyboard at this point, waiting for the imminent dismount/pick from this new rival. However...he sailed right past, apparently not a herber. I picked again and got it. To this day it’s the only one I’ve ever found.
---
It’s not that it’s unacceptable, it’s that the concept is a dead horse. In a world where we all have cell phones, messaging apps and social networks out the ass, the concept of chatting online is no longer novel. We have more methods of communication and interacting today than we have ever had. So it’s no surprise that people want something else. That thing is gameplay. Gaming has also matured to where the concept of looking up guides isn’t considered cheating, but part of the game and part of getting the most out of the money you spend. We’re all more efficient at tasks than we were 15 years ago. 
---
Rotary phones are cool, but saying people find them unacceptable is just generous framing to make yourself look better. No hate, just found the wording off putting. Rotate away friend!
---
Or avail themselves of a free faction transfer if Blizz would allow it.  I wouldn’t see many folks volunteering to transfer from Horde to Alliance on PvP servers right now, but any would help.
---
I'm on that server, whats the A-H ratio?
---
Outside of BRM, I get ganked as often as i do the ganking. It IS fun.
---
Boom, gotem'
---
Imagine living your life just to piss people off lol what a loser

I vanished and got on a flight path. The dots say they kill you but don't.
---
Also play alliance on whitemane, and am a holy priest. I’m only level 45 (not even worth honor to a max level character) but what currently logging in looks like is log in sit in a city and try to find a group for ZF because there’s no way in hell you can quest. Find group, try to take a boat and accept that you’ll get ganked at least twice between the fp and the boat and will be ressing when your corpse zones away with the boat. Then you’ll likely die on the boat again and if you can’t get back to your corpse or jump in the water fast enough before you died you get stuck in a loop or zoning and ressing. Then I finally get to gadget and there are no less than 50 horde there killing the guards and anyone that logs in or lands there. And then you drag your corpse across the desert to get to ZF. Then when you think you’ve done it, you can run the dungeon on repeat for a bit and get some good xp, someone or even a couple people will have been expecting a summon they will never get because there’s 5 mages destroying everything outside the portal to ZF. And then you loose all hope, log off and play anything else, while remembering that if you speak out loud that this system is broken people will hit you with a “PvP Happens on PvP server” and pretend that because they chose to play the dominate faction that everything is exactly as it should be, so you just stop caring about the game at all because not only is it broken but the community is toxic and refusing to admit that if there roles were reversed that they wouldn’t be so smug about PvP on a PvP server. And to clarify this isn’t one of those posts where I’m blaming the horde, it obviously is the exact same way on alliance dominated servers, it’s not the player base of one faction that’s toxic, it’s just the way people choose to play when they’re the dominate faction.
---
That's a good point, had a lot of friends who quit at least until BGs but probably for good
---
Playing the game involves two factions.  You've killed the pvp aspect of the game for one server and your influx to another has probably killed pvp on your news server.  Congratulations, you and your mates have damaged two servers.
---
The same way they were banned for using the dungeon exploit to spawn a fresh dungeon when they beat the final boss. 
---
They are exploiting a game mechanic to get around the honorless buff.
---
That's after level 48! And that's hopefully going to chill out after dec10 when wsg and av are released! OP should have no problems levelling from 1 between now and then :)
---
It’s still doable with the wonky aggro but requires jumping down when King is near to make him walk towards the ramp which helps position him closer to Cho before feigning. Makes it all take twice as long. So glad you posted this and the one dude mentioned 5pc bonus bc that’s definitely when this started for me
---
literally just press V
---
Sorta weird to see the horde actually “win” a server. 
---
Guess that’s kinda it. Can’t really level up on a server like that, the only fix is to transfer in a new group of alliance.
---
Treat people like a resource and make the game unplayable. Its like strip mining.
---
Alliance are entitled to leave and play the game and now suddenly the Hordelets are mad at Blizz?
---
Thanks!
---
And his name is Overkill lmao.
---
It has NOTHING to do with personality traits. It’s all about the racials. People discuss this all the time on like every wow forum ever.
---
From my understanding of it (and if there's someone reading with more knowledge than I, feel free to correct me), what's happening is that you're only aggroing *either* Cho *or* the King, and then that aggro pulls the other one into combat. Cho is in combat not because he noticed your pet, for example, but because he noticed that the King is in combat which puts him into combat. So when you FD and then re-aggro, the linked mob then notices you because their aggro table is linked . Now, because your 5 piece bonus is an aura, he then notices you "buffing" your pet, which causes a tiny amount of threat. 
---
  
---
The way around this is to body pull both of them *at the same time* and use howl to generate some threat so that your aura doesn't cause enough to pull. There's a lot of great info in the Classic Hunter discord if you'd like to know more.
---
I guess horde won but it’s hardly a good thing - server is just done. I guess everyone can go find a new fresh earlier than expected.
---
Yep. Server situation only worsened the last two weeks. I loved it before that.
---
Wow what an awful idea, please don't apply for a job at Blizzard.
---
Imagine being so fragile that getting killed, then danced on, in a video game hurts your little feelings.
---
WOTF and Hardiness. Look at what % of Horde players are Orcs and Forsaken.
---
I spend hours trying to find a leveling spot for my 50 hunter but it's impossible, especially since sometimes my pet dies and I only have some few food for it on me. Barely anyone does dungeons around that level anymore so even dungeon grinding is extremely slow. 
---
BGs not coming out with honor system was a huge mistake, thankfully it's getting a bit better soon.
---
&gt; 1-60 phase 1 was basically a solo and felt like low-pop server. then boom phase 2 and layers down, suddenly everyone who has nothing to do at level 60 are all on the same layer.
---
I had the exact same experience as someone who logged in on minute 1 of the launch and played a lot in the first week. There must have been 20+ layers on Whitemane in the first few days, because everywhere felt DEAD.  
---
I'll never forget running into Org for the first time at level 10, expecting to see a massive Classic WoW launch celebration, and seeing maybe 4 players scattered around.
---
It stayed like this for at least the first week. I was in Arathi and Hillsbrad looking like that John Travolta Pulp Fiction meme wondering where everybody was. 
---
And eventually once the layering and server caps were tuned, starting at weeks 2 and 3, the game finally felt alive.
---
I would be super happy with F R E S H servers at some point down the line with zero layering.
---
Pretty sure that for pvp  you only need 3% to never miss
---
Good question. No clue what their reasoning was, they didn't really talk about it. If I were to guess I'd say Blizzard felt the original mount system better suited the classic experience.
---
Well tbf it was Blizzards fault with release so few realms at the start. People care too much about their characters names so i do understand why people never hopped over to another server after securing their name in one of the 2-3 pvp servers at the time. When one guy stays, usually the rest of his friends/guildes stay as well. I think a mix of having 10+ realms and a promise of merging realms if the population dropped would have helped give people the peace of mind to roll on a smaller server.
---
dont cry, this is what you have when you want to avoid queues and chose this kind of server, that server is ded from day 1, not surprising
---
Oh jesus shut up. 
---
WoW has been Horde majority pretty much nonstop since TBC. I guess Dubya did it.
---
Once invincible, now the armors wearing thin.
---
Last I checked on wowhead it showed as nearly an even split in faction population
---
Good job!
---
Is your guild leaving as well or how do you stay motivated to play there ?
---
Lmao damn this has some post apocalyptic vibes
---
There's a quest trinket https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13347/crystal-of-zin-malor which makes this easy to test for anyone who still has it
---
From what I remember that would kill you in flight and your body and spirit would go back to where you left from but that was 14-15 years ago
---
my headcanon is that when you're tracking herbs and a node shows up your mini map, it's because you can smell it lol
---
It absolutely was.  Enjoyed every hour I got to play Phase 1.  For a casual player, Phase 2 has not even been remotely enjoyable.  Sticking around to see if it clears up and what not.
---
Around 57:43 H:A last I heard
---
im a hord player on this server, ive not played in the past week and a bit and since Honor became a thing its been impossible to level anywhere. this is not an alliance specific problem. on my 60 lock I couldnt fish or afk in hord camps as a rogue would just gank me outta nowhere. yes i understand its worse for alliance due to server imbalance but imo this has all been caused by massive overpopulation and *everyone* trying to aim for high warlord / grand marshal.
---
Shocker there’s more undead than anything
---
I played WoW from 2004 to about 2007, and randomly wandered in from the frontpage just now. WoW in 2004 was a very barren experience, and as you say everybody was just talking shit in guild chats. The whole social aspect was touted as revolutionary (well in the sense that WoW truly brought it to mainstream). This whole ClassicWoW thing has been somewhat interesting to follow occasionally.
---
I have never, ever ever, seen an MMO, MMO lite, or a looter game during this decade of games as a service model which wouldn't have players whining about the lack of endgame content. Yes, xXxJimmyxorxXx, there is no endgame because you did all the content in a week because you could write a book about the game, and now average 5 hours a day. There is no game studio in the world that can produce it and keep up with that pace, and such expectations of keeping up with players going at a breackneck speed have turned me off completely.
---
The companies kind of did this to themselves as an industry because of the service model, and then all the Jimmies who secretly dream of being full-time streamers kept feeding it.
---
That’s like saying you can’t blame a ninja looter because the game rewards them.
---
Hey guy I played on Ursin too!
---
Probably /farted on you as I rolled by since I was horde
---
&gt; why do you like to make ~~other people~~ the enemy faction upset?
---
We're not here to make the **ENEMY FACTION'S** day enjoyable.
---
"muuh report" shut up Randall. The word "report" should be banned from this sub.
---
So did you finally realize you were wrong or are you still spreading misinformation?
---
Cool man. I see a few of you running around. There must be dozens of you, dozens!
---
Being here and arguing with people is worse tbh
---
Alliance couldn’t play on the server. Nothing was possible to do in game minimum 20min runs to mc even as a stealther. Even Ironforge we got ganked. On the boats we got ganked. I mean the game was unplayable because of the ratio.
---
My favorite was escorting the chicken in feralas and at the last pack when the chicken apparently followed the feared guy and I didn’t notice and failed
---
I'm almost hoping WoW catches the 4chan script kiddies' ire again for a DDOS so I can do a mocking LARP of that mentality.
---
"dOn'T bLaMe ThE DDOSeRs, BlIzZaRd iS aCtuAlLy At FaUlT here for not having servers that can handle it"
---
"who cares that your MC raid was disrupted. if you had already git guded, you'd already have all your MC gear scrub"
---
"the retail servers are still stable. go to retail"
---
"you're mad that you can't play WoW during this DDOS? you take wow too seriously, maybe you should take a break from wow"
---
on a side note, I do like the camel case font as a method for setting a mocking derisive tone through text, but shit it's annoying to actually type out for more than a couple words.
---
What’s funny is that the post you link state that it’s going again the grain and he mention a lot of people don’t see the problem.
---
Also stating exactly what I’m telling you: “extremely difficult for anyone on even a slightly more casual gaming schedule to compete at all in open world PvP unless you vastly out number them”
---
So thank you! You found a good back up to my argument. It’s very kind of you :)
---
And no my point is that PvP in Classic require a lot of time, you are the one making shortcut that not having time = bad and this ridiculous notion that playing 2 hours/day is retail... I mean it’s so stupid that I cannot take you seriously anymore. So bye!
---
Dude, stop trying to bullshit me.   Rebirth is not used to battle res in 5 mans the vast majority of time.  It's used to resurrect someone that died, so you don't have to wait for them to run from the gy.  Even if you are using it in combat, it's not because you need them to win the fight.  It's because you have mana to spare, and you dont want to wait for them to run from the gy.
---
Horde players decided to not release Battlegrounds? 
---
Hate the game not the player, mr dad gamer
---
I don't think any specific raid content will roadblock a guild. 
---
With that said I do think all of the content together will roadblock guilds. This is the main reason you see so much emphasis on efficiency from pserver guilds. In vanilla you need to be able to clear all the content efficiently to keep up.
---
When you combine managing MC/BWL/ONY/AQ and the 20 mans guilds that aren't efficient start playing real hardcore hours to keep up or they just implode and when guilds implode in classic people tend to just quit playing.
---
Yeah a scan takes 10 minutes, without getting even close all the people on the server. That's the point, dingus.
---
Because its blizzards fault? Its not the dominant factions fault they're the dominant faction population wise.
---
We are staying! Was in org after the raid around 23:00 server time, and it was as busy as ever. We'll see what happens, but we're not giving up on the server.
---
Would have. And no they would not.
---
I absolutely expected it, and thats why I absolutely refused to roll on a PvP server.
---
The reason I absolutely expected it is that I'm currently winning EvE, and I know what happened to lowsec, and for exactly the same reasons. People are going to pretend they are hardcore PvP types, and they are going to huddle together where they have the majority and find something else to do if their side is losing.
---
This is so true, multiple times minding my business and have gotten whispers, hey wanna do dungeon x, while I never intended to, when asked directly I was down for it, but had I not gotten direct whispers I would have continued questing.
---
Hit a nerve eh?
---
[removed]
---
And yet there are far more horde dominated servers than alliance.
---
Let’s assume you are right - being in the majority results in this behavior. The type of person that enjoys this behavior is obviously more drawn to the horde. Ergo, the assertion that horde are shitstain assholes stands for the vast majority.
---
But hey. If someone enjoys spamming a single button not moving around at all for 10-15 honor per kill (at best), i can only laugh.
---
The transfers appear to have only compounded the issue further; when the minority faction leaves, it throws off the balance even further for not just the server they left, but also the server they're now joining.  Populations are getting thrown around and upset that, up until a week or two ago, were more-or-less balanced (Earthshaker being the example in this case).  
---
Through more careful management of transfers, Blizzard would be maximizing the chance of players' continued subscriptions.  Not through opening the server transfer gates here and there for some of the problem servers in the hopes it would sort itself out.
---
You ain’t transfering anywhere young man. I’m gonna gank your ass till I gain 0 honor and after that I kill you for the meme
---
The only situation that I've seen is the one on reddit.
---
There is a lot of unbalanced servers. PvP servers combined have a 59/41 split in favour of Horde. The PvE is way more skewed to the Alliance. 
---
There is a EU server that is like 98/2 in favour of the Alliance. I'd love to know what's going on there. It's like the Alliance completed defeated the Horde.
---
It’s the min max, meta mindset people have nowadays. It makes these people feel like they have a clock over their heads and they’re constantly fighting it.  It’s so prevalent nowadays.  
---
The rest of us don’t want to solve the puzzle, we just want to play it. The journey is the fun. The people you play with is the fun. 
---
I wish we had a server exclusive to these kinds of people. I know that’s impossible to ask for but it’s a nice dream lol.
---
That’s not to say min maxing is bad. But when everyone does it.. yah it kind of sucks the life from the game.
---
Boneappletea post right here
---
Atleast once you got your preraid bis, you were done, instead of the endless threadmill with titanforged gear. But yeah I hate also the amount of gear reserving runs, i guess atleast you know beforehand instead seeing masterloot before the boss is pulled.
---
I got them on sale a couple blizzcons ago lol
---
GZ  
---
F
---
Yeah I'm generally not in the zerg so Alliance rogues are constantly ganking me while farming and what not
---
Two kills on him no drops. Checked him easily 30+ times.
---
Good speech :)
---
I would've transferred to Heartseeker before I transferred to Earthfury.
---
sounds fucking terrible
---
Assuming you're swords, no matter your opener you're going to want to SnD immediately after. So having 2 combo points vs 1 is really only going to provide a few seconds longer of SnD which is negligible rather than having the extra dmg from garrote. However, I almost always open with Cheap Shot on casters while in a group anyway since it's an additional interrupt.
---
Again, there are assholes on both sides. The fact that you have to mention a side with virtually no horde proves my point
---
&gt;real-time enhancers
---
Most people just call those "drugs."
---
ally own feralas and diremaul 24/7
---
Yes.
---
I mean strat is probably a bad example since you still need the reputation for shoulder enchants.
---
 Damn you're right he had FD up, what a shame.
---
Bingo. Downranking it is actually better threat. Ill take a rank 3 flame shock that ticks on an ogre for 10 seconds before we begin focusing him over earthshocking him twice for 3x the mana.
---
Lol.
---
Could you bring some reasoning behind your statement or is it as I assume, a small man justifying his asshole actions?
---
How different? I ve never heard actual difference. Could you please explain
---
It's not cowardly to run from a fight you can't win. That's called being smart. You can't blame someone for escaping 30:70 balance or worse. Some people want to play the game and not just corpse run the whole evening just to get to a dungeon.
---
If at all blame blizzard for fucking this up so much with population numbers, no faction queues, and then unregulated transfers.
---
I was warning all my guild members to get 60 before it happened as some were dragging their heels a bit, I was certain of the carnage that was going to ensue and welcomed it. If nothing else it brought down the queues for us dedicated players.
---
I have a question, why don’t the horde transfer to the same server as the alliance and just make Flamelash straight up dead? Seems pretty ez clap idea to me. Just move the problems to a new server.
---
I used it and it was awesome, can use it till u hit 60. 
---
Worth a couple hours
---
Of farming gold
---
From Blizzard's point of view, the issue is people unsubscribing.
---
The solution to that is to let the minority faction move servers.
---
The majority isn't getting corpse camped etc, so they won't unsubscribe.
---
So, what exactly do YOU want blizzard to do about it...
---
They could try going outside
---
just a guy who doesn’t like safe spotting and camping in cities lol
---
Been there done that the non Twitchtard way 15 years ago and I couldn't be happier to cruise on a pve server for this shit
---
I don't think they see /yells when you're in stealth
---
Imo if you can do it without editing the game files or using third party software then oh well that's the game. Learn to jump up there and kick them out. I understand TOS says otherwise.
---
So you've reported them? Did that work? Now what? Have you tried jumping up there and kicking them out?
---
I saw it coming, and it's the period I looked forward to the most. This sort of wPvP is what attracted me to WoW in the first place, I still have fond memories of the TM/SS slaughter even thought I'd end up lagging out in 90% of the fights.   
---
As soon as battlegrounds come out a lot of the wPvP is going to die, the people farming honor aren't going to spend 20 minutes camping a FP when they can spend hours in AV/WSG for more honor.
---
This sort of wPvP is the entire reason I rolled on a PvP server and I honestly can't imagine playing on PvE servers.
---
They didn't say you have to do it in 12 weeks, just that it is technically possible... They aren't forcing anyone to do shit.
---
It was already dead when horde made it one sided. You sound like an abusive husband blaming the wife for leaving and saying it is damaging the family unit and burdening the state. Congratulations, you and your mates who think like you are arseholes.
---
Poor Amorim. Me and the rest of the knights of Depression have abandoned him
---
distract
---
Most likely the infamous Yang Gang. The *horde* doesn’t even want them
---
The fuck does dad gamer mean?
---
Also yeah I think Blizz shit the bed horribly. But no one held a gun to anyone's head and forced them to make the game unplayablef for people outside of a raid group. Take some responsibility. 
---
You've been defending the WPvP shitfest here for weeks and now that the Horde are facing repercussions for their strip mining of players, you're blaming Blizz. OK bunky.
---
No problem man
---
freakin optical camouflage-equipped sungrass
---
Faction imbalance was a thing in vanilla. I dont know why people are complaining when the same people cried no changes 3 months ago.
---
Honestly wouldnt mind a classic FFXI server but i think most people arent into that kind of system anymore lol.
---
Sounds like a free rank 14 to me.
---
It’s a lot to ask a player to move to a server they know will be rough for them. Big roll of the dice.
---
I'd play ally but I want to play a shaman sooo
---
Thats like if CSGO gave the terrorist side a 10v5 advantage whos to blame the terrorist side or the game developers?
---
Welcome to classic where your success in game is the exact opposite of your success in life.
---
[deleted]
---
Kinda. Only the top .01% of players can ever be r14 each week, but you also must have 60000 rating. To stay r14 you have to earn a minimum of 12000 points/week while at r13 you have to earn 16000 that week to progress. Unless you no life bg's it is hard to come close to that.
---
I second that, never liked them or Goon Squad
---
I felt the same way too but then I looked at my lvl 32 warlocks playtime and saw it was at about 60 hours, and I honestly feel like I got my money's worth. Whenever I'm in the mood for the sandboxy gameplay I'll hop onto classic, but these days wow in general has gotten boring
---
Won’t work, pally/shaman issues alone, no motivation for horde to change, it would split communities etc. 
---
The only thing I could see fixing anything is if they find a way to mash servers together without ruining economies, people losing their names, and without creating ridiculous ques. I don’t see an easy solution anywhere, apart from the ones that are already available that nobody likes

With 2217 upvotes and 2 Reddit silvers... Are you fucking kidding me?
---
This was enjoyable. Funeral service for Flamelash EU lasted all day, thanks to everyone who was there, it was actually a memorable experience.
---
Not less time as in they could achieve the goal more quickly (it always takes a minimum of 13 weeks), but it would certainly mean that they spend less time *per day* if everyone agreed to cool it on the honor farming.
---
How did they do it to themselves?
---
Haha wpvp maybe but not BGs with a few buddies. actually knowing how to fight each class goes a long way and making sure you have 5% hit and 28+% crit should remove a lot of luck. I’m saying this as a warrior who struggles against every class most of the time
---
Yeah if it ends up becoming the 24/7 AV of old,  then yeah, most pvpers will be somewhere else.
---
Servers can barely handle 40v40 fights in open world, imagine what increasing the draw distance will do.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not sure what type of virtualization setup Blizzard has for their servers now days...but whatever they have in place, it blows.
---
I mean, yeah. Forgetting all of this #nochanges vs ProBlizz tribalism for a second, this was the expected reaction of people with a "modern" mindset playing a game where every single pixel was detailed and deconstructed in a guide somewhere playing on server that had their numbers ridiculously inflated.
---
Of course you'll switch to efficiency over exploring if everything has been explored years ago. 
---
It sucks for all of those people who had the endurance to invest in a high level PvP character, no doubt there.
---
If people wanted to switch to the minority faction, then we'd have seen more movement of majority faction players to new servers.
---
We haven't. The refugees are minority faction players.
---
Therefore, allowing faction changes will be equally ineffective.
---
Iare you denying it's blizzards fault?
---
I played 18h for the first week, till I was 60 and recently only like 2 or 3 hours a day.

&gt; The leveling part of the game is going to grind to a halt. You know how people generally are nice to one another and let people quest? Say goodbye to that. Also, Flight Path's camped at every popular zone and death squads roaming. Some just for fun murdering lowbies and anyone who comes to defend them.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dq72s4/the_rclassicwow_blizzcon_day_1_megathread/f61jnbt/
---
&gt; I honestly don't think Blizzard Devs nor many of the players realize how insane this is going to be. The servers have 3-4 times the population they did in Vanilla, and while I didn't play, the horrorstories are well known.
---
&gt; Already today, Hillsbrad, STV, and Blackrock Mountain are just death zones during primetime hours. When there's incentive to camp these areas in groups even more people are going to flock and make leveling in those areas literally impossible. Also any well known farming area like the Furbolgs will be dominated by one faction with no sharing at all unlike today. It's going to frustrate some players to the point they will quit.
---
&gt; The zones and servers are also going to crash. They were never meant to have hundreds of people battling it out in them. They've always lagged to a stop and the inflated populations will just make it worse.
---
&gt; I'm not sure layers are the answer but I hope there's been some foresight put into this because I don't predict it goes over well.

Edit for the future:
---
&gt; I tried to warn you how painful wPvP would be. So let me warn you again... This won't fix those problems.
---
&gt; The problem is there's too many people on the servers. The more that go into the BGs, the more there is for everyone to farm in BRM where there's already too many horde fighting for tags.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dz4ypf/battlegrounds_comming_december_10th/f858z78/
---
Because the balance is so bad thats what they have to do to find fights. Not balancing the factions population wise is the issue.
---
&gt; think about it? Horde clearly won the server..
---
Think about it. The server cannot open the gates to AQ40 without both sides completing the war effort. Some servers never opened the gates for the entirety of vanilla. Is it really winning when an entire content phase is gone from your server schedule because one side abused an exodus out of the other? lmfao.
---
None of the census taking apps are totally accurate since blizzard cut that off but Ironforge.pro has it 42/58. Not bad at all.  I’m on Benediction which shows 41/59 and it’s a pain in the ass.
---
The balance will matter come AQ release when horde can’t complete the war effort as quickly as alliance can, thus making you wait or funnel resources to the opposite faction.
---
Imagine being a lvl 60 alliance on this server but out of town for a few day and can't use the free realm transfert before it get shutdown :(
---
Classic had paid transfers with 3 month cds. Pvp to pvp or pve. Let's go blizzard
---
way to go smart guys you killed your server for titles and blues, grats hope it was worth it.
---
I switched to a pve server, after never EVER even thinking about making a toon on one. I haven't had one regret. There are rank 6+ people on it and on several occasions a ?? horde ran by and I sent a /rude to him and continued about my 1/2 afk 1/2 leveling enjoyment.
---
Aight go make a billion dollars and cure Ebola
---
Thing is CS won't let that happen.
---
Blizzard, for good or for ill, left people to their own devices and then did nothing for what, a month now as the game circles the drain? Expediting BGs was a good call but they waited too long. A lot of people don't have that kind of patience and may not come back.
---
And thats assuming BGs are anything more than a bandaid.
---
we have enough, but with the bosses only dropping two-3 pieces per its much more efficient for us to split up the raid teams, we are gearing up so much faster since we started 3 weeks ago
---
I expected what we got. When i saw they were holding out on releasing honor i knew that when it happened it would be chaos. That is why i leveled to max and started raiding asap. I did take a week break in the leveling but i refused to be farmed as a low level for  honor lol
---
Servers are significantly more populated which introduces a new dynamic to the issue
---
I'm on the target realm of transfers. Heartstriker. We got all the alliance refugees fleeing the ganking horde from other realms. It's 70:30 alliance to horde ratio. 
---
It was a great and small server (low to medium, 50:50). Now it's high.
---
Blizz permits it, you're just not allowed to advertise in public channels or send out whisper spam.
---
I don't even know what you mean. I said that it's more horde players than alliance. Not a lot of servers has been dominated by alliance, it's of course not official info but every known resource says that. Also I'm on horde side on very good server where horde has 45%or so. I'm not complaining because I have no reason to. Not sure wtf are you talking about
---
Shamans would have to transfer as Paladins and thats a small majority of would-be transfers. 
---
Blizzard is allowing people to transfer completely off the server which is splitting communities as you are saying.
---
Merging servers would be a disaster since the servers are 4-5 times bigger than vanilla servers already.
---
GZ guys..i had few raids whit you..had so much fun, nice ppl and atmosfere in raid
---
Maybe blizzard should have thought about that before making the servers 5 times bigger than they game was built for.
---
Maybe they should have thought about that before they opened the transfers up to everyone, not just the overpopulated faction.
---
Maybe the horde players should have done the right thing and transfered to balance the servers out, instead of ganging up on everyone with vastly higher numbers 24/7.
---
In the end, it seemed hardly anyone on alliance side was having fun, so we all transfered. You do realize we don't owe you your easy ganks right? It seems you think we do, but we don't owe the horde on flamelash anything. We just want to play the game we paid for, and now we can do that.
---
Shit never works for me. They always course correct no matter who I distract.
---
not really, we are just doing it alot the same as usual, i would say dispelling is probably the biggest thing, and positioning of adds/bosses alot better for LOS to counteract alot of their spells, like gehennes and lucifron LOS the dots they cast etc
---
Anytime between 6 and 9. 
---
We were at the pass to kargath pvping when at 6:00, literally 3-4 full raids of horde stomped over us on the way to BRM. We made a hard turn after that lol.
---
???
---
Are you high?
---
Theyve been implementing lost honor this week (with awful results) and are looking into replacing the first two weeks honor. Its literally the main blue thread. How are you so misinformed??
---
Play 18h a day the first week or two. Took vacation days for release.
---
It exists and is quite popular. Plenty of people playing. Even that big streamer Ninja plays on it from time to time. https://na.nasomi.com/
---
By rolling on the overpopulated faction and strip mining human resource nodes?
---
People can try and justify it by saying the system is broken but no, no one forced anyone to camp boats, FPs, neutral towns, etc. The Horde made the game so unplayable for the entire faction on Flamelash that when given the chance, they just left.
---
Hope they got lots of honor before effectively killing their server and turning into PvE.
---
no, horde players decided camp level 48 questing alliance more than 10 times even if they yielded no honor after 5 times, just because they could do it. 
---
actually hate the player little millennial.
---
CT mod has this, I believe it's in the core module, I think there's a classic version as I installed it when classic started, but I removed it at some point.
---
Because that requires skill and he does not want to fail. He fails enough in RL and does not need that in game.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
And people say that the classic servers are 4-5x  bigger than in Vanilla. I guess I'm glad I didn't have to experience real vanilla then.
---
I  realize that this is an extreme example but still, Flamelash is a "High" population realm with 65-35 faction balance. Surely every Vanilla server wasn't 50-50 either. In retail everyone kept telling me how much more lively Vanilla was and every city was blooming of people, even darnassus.
---
But the numbers just don't add up. Everyone is either lying or simply reminiscing with rose-tinted glasses about the population back in the day.
---
overtuned private servers where 4hm had roughly 3x the damage and hp that "actual" 4hm has
---
You think you dot, but you don’t.
---
Yup. See Heartstriker in Germany.
---
I've had numerous memes removed.  Honestly it seems a bit random.  I posted a meme on r/dankmemes that got 2.5k upvotes in a couple hours that got removed for "not a dank meme".
---
zug zug ya mom!
---
I like it. Very chill people and some rp going on. Alliance seems fairly active.
---
id go barrens myself
---
As a druid the 50-60 leveling experience should be *slightly* less cancerous for me because, theoretically, I can stealth when I see someone coming.
---
Nope. Especially not if I'm mounted. If I'm mounted and going teh opposite way there, I'll see someone a nanosecond before they are in warrior charge range.
---
Funny how I posted a similar thread a few weeks ago and got downvoted to oblivion.
---
Meh, I levelled after BGs where released in vanilla, had lot sof fun pvp around the world, some was fair some was unfair, it was always a challenge and if the going got tough you could get a friend to come help you.
---
Today there were 20 people sat in chillwind sheeping and killing anyone who dared fly there. It simply isn't the same.
---
Pvp back in the days wasn't always fun, but it wasnt what it is now.
---
40 on mine lol
---
I went to the barrens had the same issue as you
---
Same thing happened to me as a holy priest not planning to do much PvP...
---
After ganking around Org last night I came to the conclusion that IF has far to few guards for how big it is.
---
I wouldn’t say I expected it to be vanilla but I sure would enjoy it a lot more if it was. I didn’t expect just how strongly people would rush and min max every aspect of the game. It’s basically a scripted experience at this point to go farm gear in groups that are rushing as quickly as possible. 
---
I already unsubbed because I don’t enjoy the min max mentality and don’t like how toxic everyone is about gear.
---
&gt; No one wants to spend 2 hours getting camped by a 14yo with nothing better to do
---
You guys really need to stop pretending that these people are "14 year olds", they're adults. It's getting camped by 30+ year olds for 2 hours, and 30+ year olds crying about getting PvPed.
---
Id sooner quit the game than reroll, I dont even like rolling alts nevermind starting on a whole other realm.
---
I mean that's sort of bullshit that if you don't use your free transfer you're basically stuck in a dead server. If you're going to do some sort of intervention just shut down the whole thing or merge it into another server. 
---
But maybe that'd fuck up sharding or layers or whatever
---
How about if that happened based upon class? For example, folks playing DPS having trouble getting into dungeons, raids, etc. We can’t all be hunters and we can’t all be horde.
---
problem is that fury/prot warriors have miniscule health pools (friendly reminder that 4hm has quite a lot of spell damage) and take far greater amounts of damage than bears
---
Yeah..honestly classic wow is pretty casual atleast before the whole pvp thing. Guilds are clearing MC in less than 2 hours now. After that you can chill, do a dungeon a day or work on an alt. Theres no endless amount of grinding of AP or FOMO on missing dailies. 
---
People forget that there were millions of adults that played vanilla wow back then, who had just as many responsibilities as adults todays.
---
Time and place. While you aren't wrong, this post is alliance related and it's mainly the alliance being crushed atm.
---
It's like saying all lives matter at a black lives matter movement.
---
Which guild? I was in RED, Sihaya, and Tenebris.
---
boomers need to get better and stop being bitter
---
Felwood, silithus, and un'goro are pvp honor farming hotspots on high pop servers like Skeram. There are very no quiet zones in the 50+ range.
---
The emperor of mankind has a bigger cult, he actually deserves it too.
---
It was shit but I still have great memories from it.
---
Damn, this is actually kinda depressing.
---
what I gather is everyone migrated to the other server that was made available to move to, right? Aeems like you'll have to move too.
---
Yeah thats the point its poor game balance. They need faction specific queues.
---
They can’t do anything to fix this without limiting the number of player interactions for each character. Raid on raid PVP grinds the servers to halt due to all AOE interactions. That’s not a problem money can fix. They’d need to fundamentally change the game.
---
Get better against 4 level 60 when you are 48. You are dellusional
---
You know when you come in from anywhere you are still flagged for 5 minutes yea? Thats where the rogues camp on my server, right outside the portal entrance room.
---
If not thats okay, he knows he lost.
---
Having n people close together takes O(n^(2)) updating, because each player needs to be updated on each other player. If instead, for example, everyone is in their personal private instance, you need only O(n) updates.
---
nat pagle's trinket is up for every single taunt swap
---
I think difficulty can be achieved by two things: making things challenging or having them take a big time investment. Both achieve their aim of restricting access to certain things.
---
Also being skilled at PvP will safe you time, because you will win more duels/BGs then someone unskilled in comparison.
---
"no motivation for horde to change" ? i think thats wrong if a server is 60-40, i would change the fraction.
---
I liked questing in eastern kingdom more myself. Less competition for quest mobs and they seem much closer (less running) than barrens. Unless you’re already like 20-30, then head over ya.
---
You have to wonder about the lives and mental well-being of people who take the game so seriously that they get this upset about being killed in a game.
---
I unsubbed because of this.  Finding a group that isn’t filled with hardcore min maxers is hard to find now.
---
It’s just not fun to play that way IMO.
---
Tyranny of the Majority
---
I am on Incedious.  The BRD walk is real here.
---
Thanks I’ll check it out
---
Welcome to the jungle!
---
There are far too many posts due to shit devs.
---
The *real* devs put literal population CAPS on both sides of a server so that they wouldn't get out-of-whack... but not *these* devs.  I'm surprised *these* devs haven't drown in a urinal.
---
I'm not gatekeeping shit man. 
---
PvP servers are meant for PvP.
---
Ah, every time i see one of these i think about making a rogue.
---
Flamelash wasn't a low pop server, it was high. Yesterday most alliance guilds left and some horde guilds decided to leave aswell.
---
Why are you so bothered by people who ask questions? You make it sound like they’re evil.
---
Horde has the pvp oriented crowd. They've controlled the leveling areas and have not seen any allies actually shoo them away. Ally that got 52 during p2, and stopped playing cuz no alliance control in contested zones i was in (blasted lands/hinterlands), and doing the 40min death run into brd killed any drive i had to keep playing.
---
And now all that's happened is Earthshaker is totally fucked.
---
Good job everyone xD
---
You can one tap with a glock, and with the new economy the pistol round is far less important. When is the last time you played?
---
Open the paid transfers already  3 month cd just like original classic.
---
Its alot fun to leveling and gearing. Once you have all gear its a bit less fun, cause upgrades arent easy to get (need raid, weekly lockout, long rep grinds). 
---
I think the leveling phase is done, most players have their first or even more level60s. 
---
May you lucky and find some alts to level with.
---
Right but the game doesn't reward a ninja-looter. They get shadow-banned from most guilds and develop a poor reputation- it's also usually rare and isolated. All Horde players on a server-wide scale are encouraged to farm lowbie alliance because there is no other way to get honor points.
---
I don’t think you could level just with Silverpine without a bit of grinding. The Barrens has so many quests compared to Silverpine. I usually spend most of my time in Barrens and just go to Silverpine once for like 1.5 levels around 14 or so.
---
Well the edge-lords all play horde right?

Which server? 
---
According to Ironforge.pro it looks like Pagle is the most dominated server anywhere. 83/17 for Alliance.
---
Horde on my server have two alliance alts, Petespy and Trackhidden that they keep online in IF to track flagged players and stealth flagged players. Reporting them does nothing but its clearly against tos as cross faction play / collusion.
---
Raiding mc on patch 1.12 is 100x easier than mc on release.

Then play pneuma!
---
QQ noob.
---
Oh i meant in an official sense like Classic WoW, but thanks for the link, ill check it out.
---
I was in RED, Sihaya, and Tenebris.
---
Already switched to a pve server a week or two ago, absolutely loving it. No regrets AND having fun.
---
Or just stay unflagged because what’s the point especially if horde is camping IF
---
Sounds like someone is mad that they don't have anyone to camp anymore.
---
Enjoy rerolling.
---
Reddit search function decides to work when it wants, best of luck on your runs!
---
Failed first attempt, second attempt bags were full. I do not even remember what I deleted when I received the "bags are full message". Still ended up with the lotus.
---
Guess that's like an unofficial server merge. Oh well. Shame it ended like this, but it wasn't unreasonable to... maybe not expect, but be wary of things like this happening for unbalanced realms. 
---
But some realms will remain unbalanced unless Blizz literally disables character creation for one faction, until the split becomes manageable.
---
It's not a perfect fix, it's not even a good one (potentially locking people from joining their friends), but everything is better than this shit storm.
---
I like barrens better a lot more quests and packs of mobs. Plus you are next to wailing caverns which will be the dungeon you'll be in before SFK.
---
Same. I got a Lotus some days ago on the first try with 300 Skill, seems i should be more prepared if i find another one :D
---
Have you tried making your own murder squad?  Also, a lot of these people will disappear into pvp instances next week, and more organic small group world pvp will become the norm
---
Ever seen Hollow man?

Co-rekt.
---
That sounds pretty great! 600g! That’s one way of getting an epic mount. Casinos make a ton of cash by themselves, I wonder if this guy is raking it in at all or is this something he does out of fun?
---
How can you blame someone for picking one faction over another?
---
It's not the players' job to keep servers balanced.
---
I think private server players who say the debacle on Kronos knew that these were going to be a really rough couple of weeks. I definitely thought so. 
---
Where I am not sure anymore: whether it gets better with BGs. I thought it would just be a few weeks but now with some servers factions getting even worse split I don’t know if it’s just temporary. 
---
Good luck pvp. I went pve for first time ever, to save myself some pain and am very glad I did.
---
Why is this stuff always removed the moment I get to it :(
---
Ya I parked my mage at brd and my guild said they would run me but theres a queue to get on for 45 mins when I play so It would take 2 hours just to get started.
---
Ah I’ve personally never been a fan of world pvp so I always just play where I can’t be ganked. Don’t get me wrong I love to PvP but when I’m doing other things I don’t need the hassle of some neck beard disturbing me
---
He doesn’t have to imagine it brother.
---
You can't leave because that would make it shit for the people who made the game shit for you to begin with.....
---
What utterly dumb reasoning
---
As someone with the mathematical skill of a fucking walnut, I took some time to fully understand how percentages work. As the other replies have pointed out, no, 35/65 is essentially a recipe for server genocide.
---
Lol nice. 
---
Horde basically won the world of Warcraft.
---
Get these people some awards!
---
It seems you're new around here. Blizzard don't give af about server balance. When they introduce server xfers they stand to make a lot of money.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1z63j/unequip_weapons_macro_for_saving_rep_costs_on/
---
Modify the macro listed here.
---
Yeah what the others said, but i’ll also point out that if you cheap shot a target, it won’t attack the tank and he will struggle to generate enough rage to hold threat. Eventually tanks will start getting annoyed with you
---
&gt;Start a character on a PvE realm and only log him whenever your pvp experience isn't bearable. You'll be surprised how fast you'll level it.
---
But the PvP experience is never bearable anymore, which means I'd only play on the PvE alt.
---
Oooh. I get it.
---
Prot has a place in more casual raids.
---
Is this just an issue with pvp servers? I am on Mankrik and its always busy.
---
I mean or I just quit. I threw out 12+ days because I didn’t want to double down. I am not into the repetitive experience. For that many hours I’ll give something else a try and maybe pick up classic again when the servers are quieter. I wanted pvp. I didn’t want a squash fest. This is not the vanilla pvp I signed up for.
---
Looks look like they won the game to me
---
Pretty sure server pops were much lower in vanilla as well,  the whole no changes thing is a myth. It also ruined classic.
---
The same faction transfers as alliance are getting?
---
Flamelash 2 weeks ago had a bunch of people in Ironforge.
---
It died because all the big guilds on alliance side left over the span of a week.
---
I mean if youre bored at 60, you do what people did a decade ago, you make an alt.
---
I have a 60 character in Hoagie Heaven before people start screeching "Reeeee you're Alliance!"
---
Was more so speaking to Horde players in general. More of a preemptive comment before all the “pvp happened on a pvp server” derps came out of the wood work
---
Who said anyone was mad?
---
This sounds like a world first to me
---
Something my wife has never said
---
&gt;All in all, relatively speaking, nothing will change.
---
Yes, it will. People get strong armed all the time into stopping their rank grind via threats of KoS and targeted assassinations and camping (not for honor, but to keep the person down for the day so they fall behind honor-wise). By having fewer of these people, the high end isn't pushed so far above everyone else. Instead of 10% of 500 serious PvP players pushing past rank 10 and forcing 50 players to fight tooth an nail for that weekly honor standing, you'd have 10% of 100 (any smaller value, really) pushing to be r14, and suddenly you have 40 less people making the grind to the subsequent ranks substantially difficult.
---
The ranking system is an ever rising pyramid. In order for people to push their way to the rank they want, let's say rank 10, they have to climb on top of everyone else, and that's harder when there's more people because there is more honor in "circulation", if you will. The more honor that is in circulation, the higher the rank floors will be ("rising" pyramid). 
---
People pushing rank 10 make it harder for the people below them to get their ranks because of how high they push their honor. The people pushing rank 14 make it harder to hit rank 13, so the people going for 13 push harder, making it more difficult for rank 12 to get their rank, and so on and so forth.
---
The sheer volume of people pushing for ranks is nuts, and it makes ranking substantially more difficult because you need more honor per hour, which means you need more kills than you used to. Honor scales with rank and with level, not with player count, so the amounts are fixed in terms of honor per kill, and the amounts needed to rank are not in terms of honor per rank.
---
You climb the best you can, but the top is rising too, and with the top being pushed upwards by more players to kill (more honor per hour) by the true competitors, it means everyone involved in the honor grind needs to be farming more to be in the certain rank percentile the top players set (their "standing" for the week).
---
HKs give Contribution Points, Contribution Points give Rating alongside your standing with the other players on your server. Other players farm more honor each week with more people, meaning 30 kills on a 3k capped realm with 1k concurrent means WAAAAAY more than 30 kills on a 7.5k capped realm with 3.5k concurrent because, on average, higher population servers have higher kill counts. 
---
A quote directly from the wowhead article about the honor system:
---
&gt;Your weekly rating is calculated with an average of your last week's rating, and your current standing compared to other players on your server.
---
As you can see, you cannot rank unless you stay competitive with those players. Kills do not get distributed evenly from player to player (obviously), but that now means that the kills totals on the high end will be higher than if the population caps were lower.
---
TL;DR:
---
Population matters because there is more honor in circulation with a higher population. Because honor gained per kill scales only with level (48 being the breakpoint) and PvP rank, and rank Rating floors scale with the *honor earned last week vs. your current standing*, the rankings are far more competitive, meaning more honor must be gained, which means more kills must be had than what we have been used to. Because more kills are not only possible, but occur on higher population servers, we can see that it directly affects your weekly Rating, meaning population DOES have an effect on the ranking system and how many kills must be obtained. Whether or not you think the effect is substantial is mostly a subjective matter (and I can't get into the math to say whether or not it is substantially more), but there IS a difference with more people in the Honor pool.
---
EDIT: I know the original issue was that there wouldn't be a difference with 10 vs 100 people corpse camping you, but the truth is that a population cap decrease would affect PvP. PvPers wouldn't camp BRM for so long if there wasn't such a large pool of honor to be had. The thing literally never runs out for them, and that pushes the kills higher. Instead of wasting time farming the 20-40 people in the zone for all of their honor, they'd move around more because otherwise it would be a waste of their time.
---
If they had the coordination to move like these alliance guilds are then it shouldn’t be rough, just more even than they’re use to.
---
IMO there should have been a mechanism in place from the start that pushed servers to balance.
---
The majority faction is also in danger, hence why OP made this post - they aren't happy with the ultimatum of whether to move or not themselves.  When only the one faction remains on the server, they have the option to either stay onboard their sinking ship, restart completely (with or without guildies/friends)), transfer if they still can, or unsubscribe since all that free time spent in the last 3 months is going down the drain.  The difference in the equation being the minority faction tends to have (for now) the added choice to transfer, and the majority faction having had the perks of being just that for however long it lasts before their community breaks apart as well.
---
You can't gank that which is logged off and playing a different game though.
---
Hopefully the horde actually spread out to other servers than just earthshaker, else the same thing will happen there as well.
---
Woah could, could both factions be to blame? Wow what a thought!
---
Wait no silly me, the Alliance could never do anything wrong.
---
You realise most of the people who would paid transfer would just quit before the reroll.  Either way the game is dead if they keep transfers locked for that long.
---
Maybe when bg queues become an issue.
---
Hey I'm one of those dudes!
---
Seeth more
---
If you dont mind playing on an East Coast server PVE or PVP I'll level with you! Come check out how Awesome Classic is!
---
 IMO it's been Fantastic! Its had its ups and downs, but I genuinely think theres a place for everyone a cross all the different server types. 
---
If you want to Experience and explore the Lore/World of Vanilla  play PVE or RP. If you like to PVP play on a pvp server obviously, or maybe try a few servers until you find something you like (just to like level 5 or so) 
---
Whatever your playstyle might be definitely come check it out!
---
You're confused. No one was "cowardly" or "reckless", but merely acting in their own self-interest within a shitty incentive structure. Blizzard could have and should have taken measures to prevent and then to better deal with this. 
---
It's similar to saying we can stop pollution if only the individual person would recycle more, laying the blame on the individual and not on corporations.
---
Oh boo fucking hoo, try playing on Herod.
---
I didn't say you were gatekeeping "shit".  I was just helping clarify what they said.  Happy to clear that up for you.
---
Except it wasn't, it had queues even up to a few weeks ago. What killed this server is population imbalance, a population that was too big for the amount of space in the world, and player mentality.
---
Is there a free server transfer open or are they all paid for?
---
Good, now I don't have to worry about a queue when I log on. See ya all my bad alliance brethren
---
The internet wasn't exactly "high-speed" in 2004. The vast majority of people were on 56k modems.
---
Every piece of loot us eventually vendored or shared. This is my perspective on loot.
---

---
Alliance: won't fight back, holds mount parties in IF
---
Also Alliance: why did Horde kill this PVP server?
---
Yup. Gotta be smart about it instead of just pressing W into the next set of Horde mobs and just dying again.
---
What server is that? Queue died about 3 weeks ago on Gehennes which is one of the bigger realms. 
---
Rested exp is too much for me to miss out on. I am currently getting 25% of a level in 1.5 hours in dungeons, too monotonous and slow for my liking.
---
Did all the alliance join the world server chat channel?
---
Umm, this site is horrendously inaccurate on my realm.....

Congrats to the horde for winning!
---
This needs to become a copy paste response
---
didnt read
---
Depends what you mean by good experience.
---
There are still raids gearing up and running MC/ony regularly. But they more often than not are farm status players running through on alts, or with extras to fit numbers. 
---
So it's not quite as "new" as you may want, but if you're fine with that, then yeah, good experiences to be had.
---
Ninjaing is against the rules. Killing other players isn't.
---
Yep, Flamelash is now essentially a PvE server for horde, lol
---
Classic doesn't work like retail. When a new raid comes out, tons of people will still be running the old raids.
---
Can't do that on PVP servers
---
Deviate Delight is 50/50 get bent nerds
---
&gt;encouraged to farm lowbie alliance because there is no other way to get honor points.
---
So fighting people your own level doesn’t give honor? Ok.
---
I feel like I’m seeing more and more Horde over the past few weeks, so hopefully that number is closer to 70/30 now (wondering if it’s from PVPers rerolling PVE). Horde come join us on Pagle~ it’s more fun when it’s balanced. Also I think we’re the largest PVE realm in NA, so very unlikely to die!
---
Yeah, sure.
---
i foresaw that people on reddit would lose their minds and write endless screeds about it, which is what people on reddit do about everything
---
Ratios dont change *much* because of population. Both factions are opportunistic.
---
You're just the idiot who doesn't understand that this isn't on the players, not at all. It's on Blizzard.
---
??? what is the alliance supposed to do when their server is 65/35 BEFORE faction transfers opened up?
---
it's just not fun to play in phase 2 when the major faction is wpvping so maliciously
---
Good to see our server get more exposure. We don't see as many posts or references compared to lots of others
---
No, they aren't in danger.
---
They are in a lack of danger.
---
And the dirty secret is they like it this way.
---
I mean yeah, there's already an inherent "no life" to playing a 15 year old MMORPG that takes like 200+ hours just to reach the endgame content. But proceeding to spend your time after that griefing other players 5+ hours a day for absolutely no ingame reward/benefit, is another level of "no life" entirely.
---
Loved it, thanks!
---
Blizzard offering such a small selection of servers is what led to some being massively overpopulated, which then necessitated the waves of free transfers, which is what really blew up the faction imbalances.
---
Damn I was there last night, I never make it into the screenshots
---
Ah contraire, this is the very definition of a target rich environment. 
---
As long as there is an active resistance and viable economy, give me the 1-2 side of a population imbalance every time.
---
Arugal alliance - last 7 days 34/66
---
Please tell me your rank14 secrets.
---
The game rewards them because they get the loot. The only punishment is the social punishment imposed by other players, not the game itself. 
---
In PvP the social punishment would be alliance grouping up to kill the gankers, but the population disparity in Classic doesn’t support that.
---
How can he dance!?
---
For me it's where to play. I want to roll a PVE server cus you know, I want to actually play the game. Which one to pick tho? Leaning towards Pyrewood Village, but maybe Mirage Raceway would be better? Dunno. I'm rolling warrior on alliance
---
Does your guild care about who tops the healing chart? Mine doesn't. They do care for dispells.
---
*Meanwhile, on Grob*
---
Arena anger golem takes approx 15 mins when u get it down mate
---
horde aren't even that bad off on heartseeker, especially because horde hubs are significantly harder to camp than alliance hubs are.
---
I hide behind the pillar straight left of them both when I pull, I body pull with pet then send him back up on the ledge, and take my position on the 2nd last pillar and I'm constantly hiding there from that point onward. you don't have to jump down unless feign resists.
---
Not on my server
---
How did HE kill the PvP aspect on his server, are you smoking crack.  If he is having 30min to an hour corpse runs just to get to BRD the faction imbalance is and has already killed PvP.  Too many people rolling Horde is what is killing PvP on most servers.
---
Don't knock it till u try it
---
I don't think that makes much sense as in this case _every_ PVP oriented player would choose horde which is not the case.
---
In the situation you describe everyone should expect that Horde will be heavily outnumbering Alliance due to favorable racial. Yet still some people choose Alliance, while the majority chooses Horde, full well knowing they will outnumber Alliance. So surely there is psychological factors / personality traits / whatever in play - i.e. there is a difference with regards to these factors between those people choosing Alliance and Horde.
---
&gt; the honor system is broken
---
So this is a trash opinion? You heard it here guys, Alliance think the current system is aces!
---
It’s their fault for grinding honor? It’s their fault for building a resource implemented in the game? 
---
You expect the opposing faction to play different so it suits your needs?
---
Horde has done what everyone is doing, playing the game. 
---
I have sympathy for the really unbalanced servers but honestly it’s not the players fault for killing you.
---
I find it shocking that you would expect an entire faction to play differently to make the game more fun for you.
---
I understand it hurt them too in the long run but honestly were they just supposed to hangout in org and let you do your thing?
---
for me, pvp servers become a lot more fun post classic. first off, the honor system is reworked and there's no incentive to farm other players in the open world as if they were mobs. and second, there are flying mounts, which means you can choose to not partake whenever you don't feel like it. 
---
that said, the people who do enjoy classic pvp obviously get nothing out of it. and, from what i picked up, it makes expansions pretty much a non-option for them. maybe they should think about adding hardcore pvp servers for bc and so on, remove flying and have the old school honor system implemented or something like that. although i guess that'd take way too much effort from blizzard, seeing that they couldn't even enforce faction balance, something that every private server did and does.
---
Ah, I forgot the stipulation of camping the menethil boat 24/7 that being the dominant faction brings.
---
I had no idea I would be realm-transferring today to avoid being on a dead-server, that's for sure.
---
At the same time, Blizz couldn't have handled it worse. Ok, the balance on Flamelash wasn't nice. But when you open up transfers it just gets worse, if they're not faction specific. But then, they announced BGs, and some Alliance guilds might actually wait it out to see if things get better; but no, they close transfers so it's move now or move possibly never, and all the alliance leave, and it gets so bad that even the horde follow because they don't want to be on a dead server.
---
I would've expected things to be much better than this, that's for sure.
---
You might also look at doing Ragefire Chasm and Wailing Caverns ... but feel free to go exploring. You might want to skip the Barrens completely and go direct to Stonetalon Mountains.
---
Just move to stormwind 4Head
---
In the last 5 runs to BRM I only had to corpse run once. From the steps to inside the spire. Last night alliance controlled LHC for the whole night except mayrb half hour. We took BRM from the horde but they managed a retaliation. Made some horde corpse run for an hour though. 
---
 It's horde favoured but imo not really. There is some really solid alliance guild. Couple who solely roam killing horde lol. Though chillwind camp was fucked as horde were trying to farm all the 55's trying to quest.
---
If you're having a good time, stay where you are.
---
Go on flamelash EU alliance side and check the major cities; the situation will be rather obvious rather quickly.
---
Yea I want my 40 mage on my now mains server to be fair..   
---
I knew pvp would be a fuckfest like it was in vanilla, so I rerolled to pve prior to phase 2. Goddamn friends wanting a pvp server..
---
Heres how to get better
---
/&lt;number&gt; Horde about and ganking, pst for invite to roll them.
---
Anyone aiming for r13+ just randomly is a complete and utter ignorant clown.
---
Most (all?) Servers will have a control group who could tell you who the first dozen 14s are. They'll also have agreements in place to ostracize and harass / grief anyone on either faction who tries to compete with them.
---
Vanilla r14 was toxic, classic r14 is organised toxicity.
---
I'm pretty upset that cross-realm BGs will be a thing.
---
Hordes here can now have their cake and eat it too. They managed to piss off the other faction into mass exodus, but they'll still be able to use Battlegrounds just like Hordes on Heartseeker, for example.
---
The very people who wished for Classic is killing Classic in return.
---
This is very agreeable.
---
Root cause of the problem is blizzard gave free reign to the players when it came to controlling faction balance. 
---
Obviously the imbalance wasn’t intentional but Blizz did nothing to actively prevent it.
---
&gt; little millenial
---
Millenials are in their 30s now? Pretty boomer thing to think adults are not...adults.
---
I think in flamlash circumstance, when you only got like 30 alliance left hiding out in IF, and you dtill need to get honor as horde, you gotta go camp IF then
---
Yeah anyone really invested into rankings already has an honor addon and it quickly tells you the diminishing returns and how its adwarding you zero honor.
---
Just get 1 kill, r14
---
The fact this fucking loser reported an alliance for being up in the area hisnown raid was in just minutes before is fucking enraging. These sweatlords are such absolute human garbage... like toxic and delusional. He probably believes that reporting that player for being in that area is right when his own group WAS JUST THERE and ROUTINELY exploits that spot every fucking day.
---
Yeah the Horde posters here seem pleased as punch about the situation, huh?
---
Has anyone had issues since Tuesday with mage AOE farming Mara for experience? Before Tuesday, I leveled 47-51 in peace inside Mara, getting a level about every 2-3 hours. I'd farm the mobs, use a guildie to reset me, and keep going. Now it seems that 1) every single pull at least one monster resists my frost nova or blizzard slow. Wasn't the case before. 2) When I go to reset the instance, it automatically gives me the "you're not in this party" hearth message even though it was the first farm of the day and I wasn't instance locked at the 5 in an hour cap. Anyone else experiencing issues with this or with general farming and instance resetting? Thanks!
---
Yeah I swear people on here are just itching to get pissed off at everything. Someone typed /dance after a gank and now we have redditors analyzing his life choices. Not that they'll ever see the irony.
---
Happen rarely unless you are really fearing close to its leash distance.
---
This is great
---
Horde wins.
---
Spam AV
---
Not really. You must not have handled business, finance, politics or science before. Bad data is more harmful than none at all in most cases.
---
This is going to be an unfavored opinion but go fury and give dw a try. Having vanquosher sword and sword of omen is disgusting damage. Yes you miss a good amount but if you que HS or Cleave it makes it less painful. When you reach the 50s yes IBS is op as can be but you can score easy hit for fury and be on your way to gearing
---
If you change it to lvl 60 only for last 7 days it's 35/65.
---
The horde are camping a lot but they don't seem very organised. My guild ran to MC for raid last night. I got credited for 30 kills in the time it took our raid group to run into mc it was crazy.
---
&gt;43 minutes
---
&gt;Record Low Queue Time
---
&gt;Implying dead server
---
lmao
---
I can't imagine server merges not happening at some point. I think by allowing signups in groups, it gives Blizzard smaller chunks of the population to tailor it to the best-suited server.
---
You are definitely right I should have expected it given how games are played today.
---
Oddly enough I don’t mind it so much in other games but hate it in wow. I think it’s because the content is so thin and I have a lot of nostalgia about the more social aspects of the game.  
---
Maybe that flawed what I expected.
---
Interesting to hear the thoughts on Thunderfury. I play horde on TF and cant roam around without getting stomped. I checked the census today and its 6k active alliance vs 3800 horde.
---
I have 3 horde chars and I would change to Alliance, no problems. With BGs incoming, the horde population only result in massive queue times for horde to BG while Alliance get instant queues.
---
To be honest if I had known my server would be so wacked with high horde numbers I'd roll Alliance from the start.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyG2hJewpy0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyG2hJewpy0)
---
What does it matter when the end result is "I cant play the game"? I mean, that's the Alliance complaint riiiiight? Because if not then your complaint sounds like "I got pvp'd on a PVP server"
---
I don't even play in that fucking region so you can can the "you"s.
---
All I'm gonna say is you're right. People made decisions. You choose to analyze the Alliance's to shift blame and handwave everything the Horde did as "part of the game". 
---
Why did Horde have an expectation that people would just be OK being camped indefinitely? You get what you pay for.
---
Didn't know you're on every server in every zone 24/7.
---
Well i use luna unit frames, but it changes the whole ui, so...
---
It's the pity olympics and they're the guy on steroids complaining they might get caught and that their pp is too small
---
I’m horde and gladly would swap to alliance. I just don’t have the time to level another character to 60.
---
There needs to be more than one person involved for anything to be collusion.
---
Ah right, Juju Might is AP, my bad. So I could stack Elixir of Mongoose, Giants, a Blasted Lands buff and a Juju buff and get the benefit of all of them? I assume the temp strength boost from Mighty Rage potion would stack as well since it's a potion. On the topic of strength buffs, does Juju Power stack with Elixir of Giants?
---
Just trying to maximize my DPS output while not wasting consumables.
---
Yeah, I can't wait for TBC honestly. I like classic but my favourite expansion was probably TBC.
---
Just hope I get that far before quitting. Assuming we'll even get it.
---
My server is sitting at 24% alliance (Skullflame EU) according to the site so it's pretty rough atm.
---
I thought Incendius was pretty Horde favored.  That said, it doesn’t become a large problem until lvl 48.
---
didn't read
---
Ally camped Zepp the other day. Camped the boat. I had 60s camping Stonetalon Horde well before P2.
---
I’m kinda sad for the lack of a response.
---
I was camped for 6 hours the other day in STV, I really don't mind getting camped from time to time if it means a healthy WPvP scene come BG's.
---
I'm not playing Classic, but I do follow the forums. Sort of like Eve Online: zero interest in playing, but damn if the drama isn't entertaining. I can't wait for BGs to be released next week, that's going to be my Super Bowl.
---
I did play Vanilla though, so yes, I saw this coming from miles on the horizon. Players, by and large, do not like or desire evenly match conflicts in their wPvP, though they love to sell the narrative that they do. We've known this for *years*. The most populated PvP servers were servers that were intensely lopsided like Tichondrous or Cho'gall. People frequently pestered Blizzard to release F R E S H PvP servers despite the already existing low populated PvP servers where they might have to climb up the food chain.
---
Players have changed in a lot of ways since 2004, but in some ways, they're exactly the same. So if you enlarge server populations and combine that with the imbalanced faction ratios that players will inevitably create, then *of course* this is going to be the result.
---
I agree with the pvp situation. I'm on a Horde dominated server as Horde and I don't enjoy it one bit. I farmed honor for about 30 minutes and I was done. While BGs will help with the World pvp, the population spread could still be a problem.
---
I leveled 12-26 in the Barrens on my UD Rogue. I did not touch a single non-SFK quest in Silverpine.
---
Here's another gift for you: Shift + windows + S =a neat screenshot
---
Exactly my point haha
---
Because we're busying trying to do something about it, instead of crying on forums.
---
Ah i see, thanks
---
Doesn't work. 48 spriest vs 60 anything = resist after resist. Casters have it super hard vs higher levels.
---
4 days man, then they’ll all be inside bgs, just a little more patience -
---
I’ve got 2 toons at 48, just leveling another one. Will go back on dec 10
---
I think it would be in Blizzard's best interest to keep servers alive. People quitting can be a snowballing effect. Once a server population dies so much, other people will quit due to a lack of activity.
---
Hell yea man I’m super down if this offer is still up after this weekend. I have finals Saturday-Wednesday and then I’m a free man
---
No one is forcing you to do anything. If you don't enjoy it, play differently or not at all. I will also say pve servers are fun too and you can just make an alt on one to play at your leisure while still having your pvp main. Plenty of us make alts.
---
Are you talking with or without BG's being available?
---
People can easily get 14 with wpvp if there were no bg's, since ranks are based on what your factions honor is like but with bg's being out, doubt you can come close to the honor the people running bg's all day and wpvp during queues can get.
---
I just don’t think we have any viable options right now which sucks
---
I would say it's really, really balanced in terms of PvP. The first week of phase 2 was rough but now Alliance are dominating many world areas, whereas Blackrock Mountain, Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes are mostly held by the horde. We win some, we lose some. High population, great fun.
---
Lol, figured an Undead Rogue is a perfect example of helping others.
---
&gt; commit sodoku.

Idiot.

---
Lol I'm with ya.
---
I wish I woulda rolled alliance. Get in a solid PvP group and there would be no shortage of action.
---
It is easy to do something about it when you have 3X the numbers.
---
Just contributing to your comment - When the transfer stopped there were 9 alliance lvl 60 online, one of them couldn’t transfer because of an 10 year old parental control. The gate are never to be opened, if not a horde guild makes new bnet accounts and make a “Sacred” guild that will do the war effort.
---
I mean if you know it will save the server of course people will do it, it’s the diving into the unknown that makes me think  people wont do it
---
Alliance no longer shows up for world bosses. Ive tried to contest the last two and it has been dead before we got there.
---
It's not even nearly as bad as people make it out to be. At 2:3 the smaller faction can easily group up and take over multiple locations while the other factions holds rest. The ratio has to be a lot worse for total dominance. Of course that still requires both factions to do pvp instead of hiding in cities and dungeons. Maybe Alliance does this a lot and therefore the actual pvp ratios are worse.
---
That is a good idea as well. I feel like the population issue could snowball into massive unsubs. Hopefully, they do something.
---
Fair point if they asked for time I’d stealth it but they usually don’t and everyone start dps right away.
---
To be fair, if they'd just manned up and merged servers for retail it might not have destroyed the social aspect of the game the way sharding did.
---
I've played plenty of smaller games that have done merges and none of them turned out as bad as retail wow.
---
There's only one real solution to this problem, and that is for Blizz to dictate on which server and faction people can make characters. But that will never happen.
---
Isnt  Gutgore  bad to use in raids bc the proc will knock off a debuff?
---
Did you also expect the servers to have 3 times as many people on them than vanilla?
---
You just could decide to not be a dick till the Battlegrounds release in a few days. No one holds a gun against your head and forces you to be a dick for the sake of a few honor points. But maybe that’s what’s to expect from those “need to be rank 14 ASAP” people.

---
Ironforge pro is only based off people raid logging
---
Horde on Flamelash might disagree right about now.
---
Server mergers wouldn't work, it's heavily horde heavy across the board.   
---
    
---
Pally/shamy can just chose a new class, faction specific queue would be plenty of reason for horde to change, and 'splitting communities' is a trivial problem compared to the current outlook of what faction imbalance means for the game long term.  
---
Faction change is the obvious and workable solution.
---
What do you mean with that?
---
Sorry I don't have the answer to your question, but what mobs were you AoE farming in Mara solo to level?
---
THeres even horde in the SS thats in Ironforge lmfaooo goddamn.
---
then drop SS from rotation.
---
Nice, hopefully the other 2 allaince can group up and now you get an even fight! But then the other groups come and help the horde making it an uneven fight again. The real issue is the server cap being so high that a 3:2 numbers advantage becomes huge. 30 to 20 sucks but is manageable. 300 to 200 and the lesser group just gets rolled.
---
You *are* that comment...
---
Is this raid team1 or 2 for toxic?
---
I completely expected it to be shit, but not really because of balancing, just because I knew there would be death squads steamrolling constantly. The imbalances aren't surprising at all to me. There's so many more people playing now and although I don't/didn't know the way servers were in Vanilla as far as caps I had a pretty good feeling one side would be favored on several so I just stayed away from that entirely rather than take the chance of being the outnumbered one. More people know where to go/what to do, we're not learning along the way anymore. None of that matters as much on pve so I've been enjoying playing very much. Horde is low pop where I'm at so finding groups can be a little slower at some hours, but at least I can make it to the dungeon or quest/farm when I want without being harassed.
---
Agreed it’s really fun to see
---
Most activities I do im willing to block out a 3 hour block a week.   That shouldn't mean im hardcore
---
BRD is absolute cancer for us Incendius Alliance.
---
Same shit happened on EU Lucifron, Germany, alliance is basically non existent. Horde always with 35+ people at the gate of IF ganking.
---
It's nice to see horde griefers ruin their own realm, it makes me happy :)
---
What do you mean work towards the items for the trinket? They all drop in ZG
---
I'd like to fucking see you fucking do it
---
Imagine being a Horde on that server and having no one to gank lmaooo I guess BG's will fix that for them I guess. What a boring world theyd be in.
---
Because BG's will always be better honor per time spent unless you fight a giant stalemate, even if you lose every 10 min in WSG you still get honor for the loss that will equate to more than you get on average in WPVP.
---
But people will still be doing WPVP during queues so don't worry, horse will still be out and about most the day since they will ha r the long queues while most alliance will be in BG's.
---
Draw distance in retail and classic is complete garbage. Probably changed in cata when they did all that weird lightning changes and shit.
---
I thought in vanilla pvp could always transfer to pve.. but once you went that's it . No going back to PVP.
---
Not really, you would still have full open world pvp, but people would stop pvping once they were capped on honor. That doesn't sound anything like a pve server.
---
East coast servers are located in Chicago. My ping from west coast is about 60ms to east coast and 40ms to west coast. 
---
So, don't sweat it.
---
you'll regret a pve server. world pvp won't be that bad once bgs are out next week.
---
Need 15 HK to enter standings but the pool isn't big enough to rank.
---
It did not get fixed immediately, it wasn't fixed to 5 stacks until a while after Kazak was released, due to a paladin getting super bored and stacking up enough to one hit the world boss.
---
Thx :p was on the server since day 1, sad to lose it like that :D
---
I'm in an alliance guild with **active** 6 rogues, 8 DPS warriors, 8 mages, 4 warlocks. We have a single druid-healer, 3 hunters, 4 paladins, 5 priests. We have no retries, boomkins, ferals, shadow priests (one might spec). So when Vis'kag first dropped, it was contested by 12-13 rogues\\warriors. Mages literally fight for tier sets (despite some pieces are quite bad). Thank you, #nochanges! 
---
Now prices: DM-E, ZF and Mara AoE farm generates tons of raw gold from vendoring trash items alone. The prices on consumables are rising (8g per mongoose pot, 1.2g for winterfall e'ko, 5g for firewater), so lots of guildies have levelled a mage for AoE farm. Thank you, #nochanges!
---
Faction imbalance: it's 30% Alliance vs 70% Horde on my realm. As a result my guild is raidlogging mostly, because it's almost impossible to do anything outside capitals: we are outnumbered by 3-4 to one. Thank you, #nochanges!
---
Do you play on Herod? The balance issues aren't terrible right now. I get farmed just as much as we farm alliance. It's 50/50 if I'm getting to any BRM instance unimpeded.
---
No im just an ally on skeram who actually pvps and groups of ally more than 6 deep are very rare
---
Griefing other players *is* against the rules.
---
The alliance tears in that forum post though.
---
Besides the very initial fights at Southshore and raiding towns/cities in vanilla I can hardly remember being camped by literal raids of people. 
---
Like I remember going to gank people at the crossroads on my priest, you would have some fun for 20 minutes and then maybe a few 60s would show up. Not 30 people and it wouldn’t be for hours on end.
---
Took my mate the other day 30 minutes to get form everlook to the flight path that is literally 100 yards from the town because he kept getting MC’d etc away from where he was running. The only reason it stopped is because he logged off...
---
This is something that should probably be implemented in classic. The wildly unbalanced premades vs pugs (esp when premades are known for dodging other premades) will likely be a huge problem for some.
---
" You see, the entire Honor system and PvP system of 2003 WoW is such an  ill fit for a modern gaming setting. It's outdated and just inefficient. "
---
damn bro, they had an honor system before the game was released?!
---
BG's are going to be crossrealm.
---
First time leveling an alt, is there anything I can buy for my alt that will enhance the leveling experience? I have about a ~20g budget. Level 11 mage atm.
---
Who said anything about winning? A rogue with blind/sprint up should never really die to a warrior unless they literally kill you in the charge/intercept stun.
---
HO r De WiN S
---
At 50-55  I was killing non raid geared 60's pvp spec shadow
---
Also in rattlegore and I’ve had a really solid experience overall with leveling and PvP
---
I'm not sure how Blizzard does faction swaps on retail.  I'd imagine that any gear that was class specific might change factions but only those pieces.
---
I feel this. 
---
I loved the part of mmos that was just chillin, dickin around, like "living" in the world. Wow kinda had that back at release, but eq and uo and others more so. Nowadays it's a mad rush to the end and people look at me strange when I'm not joining in on the race.
---
2/2 Nightfall -&gt; 4% Chance on corruption for instant cast shadowbolts  
---
12.5% Chance to crit on each shadowbolt.
---
I think the worst effect of just letting people doing their thing with the low priority stuff is the lost mana/energy/rage. If a warlock throws a corruption that gets pushed off before it gets even 2 ticks off, that's a massive wastage of mana.
---
Generally in our raidgroup we just let people do their thing on trash / adds, but we're strict on bosses. But I'd like to be a bit smarter when we're being strict.
---
In your video you seem to be saying you get 1% crit per 10 agility, when this is not the case. Shamans get 1% crit per 20 agility, the same as dodge
---
Griefer, what a legend. Ganked so many defenseless lowbies he's still remembered 15 years later.
---
Not sure if you were ever part of the private server economy, but there is a huge reason the 'FRESH' meme was so highly spouted. 
---
When a new realm opens, everybody is leveling, doing dungeons, grouping up etc. Getting people together for the Onyxia attunement was easy and fun. Even after hitting 60, getting pre raid gear was enjoyable, doing your first few clears of MC etc.
---
The problem is that when a lot of people hit this point we're at now (MC clear in 1 night max, waiting for BWL) there's not much to do outside of PvP. If you're not an avid PvPer, the only thing to do is wait for raid nights. If your guild is clearing MC/Ony in a single night, you don't have much to do. You could level alts, or farm mats/gold but that's about it.
---
BWL ups the difficulty slightly, but from Private servers most half decent guilds will get it on farm in not too long. This adds a bit more flavor to the weekly goals. Now you can do MC in a night and BWL on another night. But the cycle ends up the same again anyway. Many people just log on for raiding.
---
Then you get to AQ/Naxx and a lot of players would rather just start again for that fresh experience.
---
That fresh experience that we've all just played through in classic is a feeling and experience that you'll never really get again.
---
Addon is called NugEnergy
---
Shit, I knew it. There's a big guild named &lt;Lucifron Exiles&gt; on my server now and they ganked me multiple times already while twinking.
---
I think you need to go back to school and learn how proportions and ratios work.
---
'You' was used in the plural, referring to Alliance as a whole.
---
Blizzard fucked up massively. No one can dispute that.
---
What galls me is \*now\* Horde players are coming out of the woodwork to say this after a month of "everyone saw this coming, you made your choices" boilerplate responses to criticism. 
---
But at the end of the day, Horde players actively engaged in behavior that was obviously going to be detrimental to the health of the game and their realm. Was it incentivized? Sure. So is taking a gun and going to rob 711. Its easy money.
---
Doesn't mean its a good fucking idea. Fuck Blizzard and fuck the Horde/Heartseeker Alliance for going all in on the shit show.

---
&gt;implying ally soy guzzlers wouldn’t do the literal identical thing
---
My god the salt in this one is epic
---
Lol someone is mad
---
And extra weapon skill at that point is not going to be as efficient as instead just using a piece of gear with 1% hit and some stats on it, if it's even possible to do in the first place. 
---
Those first 5 points essentially grant 3% hit. That's strong itemisation. Also glancing blow damage increase for melee although I don't *think* that applies for ranged attacks, could be wrong though. 
---
The next 10 points giving 1% hit isn't worth it, for example the gloves only give 7 weapon skill and nothing else. 
---
That's way worse than a dungeon blue with 1% hit and some more stats as well.
---
Yea but have you ever seen a Tauren on a wolf? Looks stupid af
---
Except everything 😂
---
hehe
---
The game also doesn't reward you when you kill a player with honorless debuff. The game also doesn't reward you when you kill the same player in a huge raid group multiple times. And still horde does that. I went from friendly to honored with Thorium brotherhood yesterday. There was a group of like 10+ horde camping to flightmaster. Got killed the first two times with honorless, afterwards I got killed 20 more times until I was finally done. There was no honor in killing me, its just mobbing.
---
Found the boomer.
---
No, no they're not.
---
Fun to play, yeah, but definitely one of the biggest meme specs in the game. You can make an effective 5man tank, but not having a taunt really sucks, especially since there are multiple bosses that drop threat.
---
"WE MORE NUMBER, SO YOU MORE BADDER, HAHAH LOKTAR"
---
So how is it alliances fault btw, I'd like to hear.
---
Go to your server discord. There is likely q channel specifically for this.
---
I started phase 2 as a level 52 rogue. Although things changed dramatically, I adjusted my game play to grinding mobs in really obscure places such as isolated temples etc. it didn’t completely stop being steamrolled or being ganked but it’s definitely doable and I’m still enjoying myself.
---
My level 30 something priest has gone through Desolace and STV in the same period and grouping up where possible has helped and in fact been a big upside to phase two as I would have likely kept to myself otherwise.
---
It’s a great game still...Alliance onJormanga for the record.
---
It kinda is a Horde/Alliance thing because theres what, 2 PvP servers (in NA at least) that are Alliance favored?
---
Yes, outliers exists but that doesn't suddenly make it a 1:1 thing. Case in point: see the litany of boilerplate shitposts in response to "Alliance can't play the game" threads compared to "Heartseeker Horde is getting bent over" threads.
---
How? You can stealth... If it's bad from thorium stealth through the other way
---
Weird and pedantic to get worked up over an example.  I feel like I'm on GameFAQS with oddly combative adolescents back in 2007.
---
OLEDs have been out for a while now.  My example is entirely possible, and the likelyhood of that exact scenario has no impact on its utility to provide a talking point that people have different display hardware and configurations to consider when you modify your software with other people's display presets. 
---
Replace the word OLED with something else in your brain if you can't deal with it.  I'm not changing it, it's not my problem.
---
BG's are going to be cross server so sadly you will suffer with the rest of the horde since the majority of servers are horde dominated.
---
Right but their (Horde) behavior caused that situation in the first place. 
---
Alliance didn't just decide to hang out in IF for no reason. Nor did Alliance folks quit to a point where there's only like 30 left for no reason.
---
What is the variance in profit coming from? 60g variance an hour is extremely large.
---
Irrelevant to the discussion of server-specific balance
---
Maybe if they are 11 years old back in 2004
---
We don't expect horde players to be able to read
---
It's not really either faction's fault. Blizzard has had all the faction data under lock and key since the beginning. Under their watchful eye, they allowed these horrendous faction imbalances to occur.
---
This negligence has caused many people to simply quit, reroll, or transfer off. Why should any of them give a damn about preserving a server's health when they're no longer enjoying the game? Would you? Of course not.
---
form 7 man to take out 5man gank squad, suddenly 3 more groups show up to counter you.
---
wow fun gameplay
---
Actually, world pvp was nothing like this on my original vanilla server and it was pretty balanced, and since I haven’t been playing much in the last 15 years I didn’t expect it. Doesn’t make me stupid because I had hoped world pvp would be similar to my original experience.
---
I did expect people reliving the rogue camping stuff but I never imagined it to be a thick soup of horde making brm runs over an hour. Maybe I was naive, and a lot of us were, but does that make us dumb? 
---
It is interesting though, because it lets assholes like you revel in the frustration of other people like it’s some kind of sport. So many people seem to genuinely enjoy the suffering of others in a way that isn’t just competitive fire but something really disturbing. Glad you all have wow to do this in so your neighborhoods aren’t full of mutilated cats.
---
man, that sucks ass. I guess you're best off hoping next week everything is happy time again.
---
Warrior... struggling
---
Lol
---
Interesting to blame #nochanges when this is mostly being caused by waaaaaaay higher pop servers than there ever were back in the day. Which is, ya know, a change. Also you didn't manage to suggest any big brain changes / solutions of your own, just more complaining...
---
Transfers are already closed so (unless you were \*extremely\* quick) they probably wont :P
---
That doesn't exist. If Horde lose a 1v1 or 2v2, they call in backup.
---
It'd be the same zergfest as everywhere else in an hour.
---
Why would I be salty? This is not only an amazing and really unprecedented move, its hoisting the Horde by its own petard. You guys told 'em to leave. They did. Now they're soy guzzlers?
---
Go comb The Donald's hair, son.
---
They get banned. Bots are safer.
---
Yeah around that level you should do some SM graveyard runs and also some libraries
---
Cry aloooooud!!
---
Use to do this with my guild during breaks. No issues with it. Just make sure rules are set before any gold is exchanged.
---
PROTIP: If you are holding down both mouse buttons instead of auto running distract does nothing
---
This is the way.
---
The p2 debacle really reminds me of the low-sec psychos in eve complaining about no one wanting to play with them.
---
And horde babies would troll as usual
---
That's rough and shouldn't be happening. It seems like their support side of things has been steadily decaying over the years. The in game interface is extremely slow and buggy. I struggled navigating through menus before actually being presented with the opportunity to open a ticket. Customer satisfaction is clearly not a focus anymore. Its things like this that take away from the enjoyment factor.
---
My fondest classic memory - 
---
Without any exaggeration, within 20 minutes of hearing about his death I saw the following message in Ironforge chat - 
---
“Stingray has defeated Steve Irwin in a duel”.
---
Have you done the dungeons? Shadow fang, razor fen and gnomer?
---
I did, just expanding my options lol
---
One should also consider that not all hybrids want to do all potential roles, even if it means not raiding and just doing dungeons (or PvP). I know plenty of druids and paladins that despise healing or otherwise just really don't want to do it, even if it's a pain to try to fill that spot in a dungeon.
---
yo go for a walk brother, we were a separate group despite being on OP's spy
---
that report is a joke, as is that feature
---
&gt; I think the pre-patch where the 4 dragons + windstones are released, because everyone will want to grind those bosses and get cenarion circle to exalted, and guess what they are out in the open world, costs a lot of time and money to summon, and you have no fucking chance on a shitty balanced server.
---
This.  On those servers that are 75% horde/ 25% alliance or vice versa?  Not even happening, might as well not try.
---
That goes for PvE as well as PvP.
---
One of my alts got a couple of HKs worth ~20 honor last week, for standing ~3400. The week before a similar couple of kills put it at standing 6500. Seems like a lot of people just didn't pvp last week, either because they thought they were getting no honor or because they are waiting for BGs.
---
Classic has amazing rpg mechanics but the raiding is pretty terrible, even in Naxx. Blizzard really started figuring it out in TBC and then WoD took it to a whole new level. It's too bad retail is so bad right now, because systems aside, the raid fights are amazing.
---
Keep your blog posts off this site please
---
I dont even play wow anymore but i was on the other end of the stick i played alliance on 70/30 or something pvp server and sometimes I couldnt even leave sw because horde just felt like it. But i never complained i gathered groups with my friends and guildies and did some wpvp, most of the time we lost but w/e thats the pvp server experience and if u dont like it play on pve.
---
to remain
---
It was open for horde as well, we all followed you
---
I typically use r3 heal and precast based on boss swing animations.  If I miss time the attack I cancel and start again.
---
Nasty
---
What kind of stuff? And a broken clock is right twice a day.
---
Heavy shield... down
---
I’m guessing it’s because it’s not “technically” a rooftop is the argument they’re running with.
---
Putting more than half the horde pop on queue is a terrible idea that I don't understand why people love it on this sub.
---
exactly
---
Where is the blue post confirm cross server BGs?
---
idk, i feel pretty comfortable blaming blizzard here. this situation has been botched from the start, beginning with name reservations.
---
What is there to even gain by camping cities like this at this point?
---
The Horde players know that the alliance has left, correct? Whats the point in camping IF anymore? "Might as well speed this server along to its demise and ensure I never get to fight another player ever again!" ????
---
WTF 92? That’s insane
---
This is beautiful :33
---
Fth
---
The main problem is that the servers are just too large. A faction imbalance is something that, while not great, could be tolerated on vanilla sized servers, because there were still places where there were no gank squads. but with server populations so much larger now, gank squads are everywhere, while the world size hasn't changed. That is the fundamental problem, and entirely blizzards fault.
---
I'm sorry to say I don't remember you, been a long while.
---
I’d say the game is also fundamentally different now because players are able to study history and have learned how to capitalize and take advantage of everything. So there is no benefit to having ignorance of the majority of the player base on your side as a player. During the original launch, maybe a handful of players were smart enough to exploit a mechanism to their advatange. But now a large majority of pvp players are doing so. They’ve had years to study their opponents. They have years of data condensed neatly onto someone’s webpage or in a forum to go through. And a lot of them have years of playing experience. I remember thinking it was a possibility that the game play would be a bit different, but I didn’t play during classic. I started during wrath on the underbog as an alliance player. I rolled pvp thinking my experience would be similar to wrath, but this is much different from what I remember and not fun. I am camped relentlessly *everywhere*. I can’t go anywhere without being killed over and over by pvp players.
---
Desolace maybe.
---
It has, I can't remember anyone's name either.
---
It's so weird seeing this cuz I feel like it's about 50/50. Somedays I die 5 times running to BRD, some days I dont. Hillsbrad wars push back and forth all the time and I get ganked incessantly on my alts as horde
---
I honestly think the whole Classic+ thing is a good idea. Separate realms with updates for the bad. Only downside is it will split the playerbase.
---
I started the transfer 10 minutes before shutoff and I am now happily leveling on Earthshaker. :)
---
Heartseeker is an NA realm.
---
Lucifron is an EU realm.
---
Huh?
---
&gt; At least I find solace and satisfaction by going to those old threads, finding these #NoChanges zealots, checking their post history just to see that they are either crying about the PvP condition right now or havent posted anything since P2 hit, meaning they've probably left for good.
---
This is it exactly. The only reason I don't mind the current state of pvp servers is because I know that the nochanges idiots are the only ones who'd buy into the shitty pvp system in the first place, and they are the ones suffering under it.
---
Fine, you want nochanges? Then I'll sip on my wine while it affects you harshly. Me, I'll just raidlog.
---
The vanilla honor system is crap. Flight paths being undefended is crap. World pvp beyond 20 players tends to end up being crap. Ghostrunning is crap. Faction imbalance is crap. 
---
You reap what you sow. 
---
A refined classic+ would have been amazing.. now even the influential streamers are losing interest, deathly black eyes while they spam instances on alts and never find any fun pvp fights.
---
not EVERY player chooses it for the racial, but obviously a decent chunk do. back in vanilla there were far more alliance, and now there are far more horde. do you think its because human nature has changed or because people are well aware of how much easier horde have it?
---
Oh jeez, my apologies for not being able to differentiate between loser 20 man consumable popping raid of Horde #1, and loser 20 man consumable popping raid of horde #s2-5 in Ironforge. Youre all just faceless groups with essentially the same comp and tactics. Pick a room in IF away from guards with a choke point, wait for your sappers, FAPs and cooldowns to come up, and the n blow everything on the alliance outside the door. Super cool, fun, and unique to play against. You all aren't doing the exact same things. None of it is impressive so I can't tell the difference between you.
---
All I know is that Invictims, Space Scum, and Cumsluts are the 3 sweatiest horde guilds on Skeram. Yes I do crack myself up.

---
nope its pretty even around here some horde advantage ofc tho
---
Been playing private servers since feenix, saw it coming a mile away.
---
Stop complaining about PVP on a PVP server YOU selected.
---
What's the name of that addon you're using for the energy tick? I've been looking for an addon like that
---
Of course it does
---
Saw situation coming, didn't care because it was also obvious that Blizzard would make phase 2 short. Would be surprised if that wasn't their plan from day 1.
---
This is a great point and I’m not sure anyone did
---
My initial reaction was my I tabbed something behind me, and then I started running past enemies and didn't agro them and saw i finally landed at my destination. It was a wild ride.
---
Said the alliance player, surely. 
---
I see it on both sides.
---
Behavior still would have changed. If you are unhappy with your server pop simply transfer to a "dead" server that is in fact more populous than most servers in vanilla.
---
That why dishonorable kills on lower level should be a thing if a 60 kills a lvl 40 that's gray to them it should negatively effect their honor.
---
Wouldn't being alliance on that server basically guarantee you rank 14?
---
It was wild ride to say the least.
---
&gt; They literally did it to themselves.
---
Blizzard did it by not instituting caps on horde/alliance accounts per realm.
---
Holy shit, I can't believe how old WoW is. I still miss playing because I thought it's been a few years since... now I realize how long it's actually been. The only game I ever played that I actually might have enjoyed more is earthbound, but I guess not a fair comparison.
---
what the fuuuuuuck haha!
---
the incentive is to not have the alliance all leave? are you that dense?
---
Farm another thing and use the gold to buy it. Also, try to sell summoning services. guilds will happily pay a handful of gold.
---
It’s nice that you guys lets that orc join the alliance.
---
Can do it but to be safe don't advertise even a tiny bit. Sit in IF with a name indicating you're a casino and let players come to you.
---
I think you should read one of 284739372 other parts along pretty much this
---
They actually are preferred for a boss with physical damage as they have more health and armor than warriors
---
Literally like riding a bike with training wheel and boasting that you never fall and graze your knee.
---
6 hours time to time? Pfft that ain’t nothing.
---
got a better solution?
---
Best believe that waiting on 25 minute queues on horde is going to lead to now even more organized groups in the world ganking everybody to maximize honor gains while the raid lead sits in org to queue.
---
Neat!
---
Playing WoW classic was my first ever WoW experience. I loved the PvP during phase one. Phase two made me unsubscribe.
---
It’s all for PvP at the end of the day in my mind. That’s the real end game and gives you that something to do on a daily basis.
---
This is accurate af.  I didn’t even play WoW in 2004 but I did play a game called Dransik back in middle school.. so like 2001?  And it was awesome.  Talk about having nothing to do!  The graphics were like 8 bit (maybe)..  lots of Finnish folk speaking their language in the game.  But I had friends irl that played and was the topic of conversation pretty much exclusively for a couple of years.
---
Name
---
I was under the impression there was no battlegroups? 
---
And the data on ironforge pro, which is admittedly inaccurate (but also the best we have because blizz doesn't release shit) about 45A:55H, which isn't that terrible either?
---
You’d have to be able to actually kill a member of the opposite faction to get honour.
---
That will never happen. Alliance will always be underdog generally, but some servers like mine are 60% ally 40% horde. And its an okay balance.
---
You can Star north stv at like 32ish. 
---
I’d grind harpies in thousand needles personally. Or run dungeons. There’s a big questing gap around this time. That’s why blizzard added a bunch of quests to this level bracket in tbc.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if not a single horde went Bloodfang, god forbid they try to balance a server rather than wrecking another one.
---
Anytime he blocks you can reset your Health completely or force them out of Iceblock losing the cooldowns they were waiting on.
---
If you’re not bandaging during Iceblock, that’s on you?
---
And you can only double IB once every 9 mins, it’s like a rogues blind but way worse in 1v1.
---
Yes, I am in fact not a banana
---
UR NOT FUN
---
Here's the rub with mages. A shitload of VERY good gear is greens and Blues. You don't need raid drops. Hardly any mages seem to understand this in average guilds, so you can show up to a guild that needs mages and have an impact immediately. +21 frost cloak and wrists. +30 frost boots, +34 offhand from AV, +15 wand from AV, +36 engineering only helm. +26 hands of power, banthok sash for hit, star of mystaria for hit, +29 briarwood reed, +34 skyshroud leggings, 2% crit eye of the beast, +18 eye of orgrimmar, +18 maiden's circle, +40 and 1% crit archmage robe. +29 boreal mantle. To put it bluntly, mages have the second best damage output without ever stepping into a raid (warriors technically have the best but they need thousands and thousands of gold and a burning hatred for arena). You don't have to raid to become a valuable mage for raids. Get herbalism and you can print money from DM:E lasher runs. If you farm this stuff you will find a guild that has a spot for you, I guarantee it.
---
While I understand your frustration, part of #NoChanges is philosophical.  It doesn't mean nothing would be better if it were to be changed, it just means that the can of worms is not worth it.
---
By sticking to how things used to be, Blizzard has (rightly, in my view) insulated themselves from almost all criticism.  You wanted things to be how they were, you got it.  Warts and all.  IMO, P2 will be forgotten about relatively quickly as BGs are about to drop.  The bigger problem in the end is just going to be that when you have nothing to do to improve your character other than raiding, people will raidlog and the game will be a ghost town.
---
Blizzard knows this, I think they have pretty much a great decision every step of the way here and are just letting things play out however it's going to play out.
---
Damn I thought I noticed the draw distance seemed to be very small recently compared to launch but I thought I was just seeing things. Like I can’t see anyone tender until I’m basically within casting distance from them which is making even attempting to avoid open world pvp while questing impossible. And it’s not my pc. I have a dope pc and great internet.
---
and where is the new evidence that your using?
---
He literally said proc per minute, and I was pointing out that ppm is not a mechanic in classic, please read
---
I had to look up the Tragedy of the Commons. Thank you for teaching me something today.
---
It’s a PvP game. Cope harder
---
Dude if some of these people are 30+ they are some of the most grammatically challenged, awkward 30+ year olds I've ever seen in person or in game.
---
Looks liks he's waiting for honorless kill to wear off
---
I can see it being less fun currently for someone attempting to gear up their character by running dungeons. Me being done with that, have epic mount with all movement speed bonuses and i'm a night elf hunter so i can turn invisible, track people and prevent tracking. Don't suffer nearly as much as everyone else
---
Someone has to be last?  Warriors basically run PvE, no one is paying a magenor lock to do a dungeon.
---
Every side has its ups and downs. I usually roll against 2-4 people for gear in a 5 man, how many do you?
---
Or maybe, don't be an asshole. That would put the responsibility on the people who are being asshole, well now, we can't have that.
---
The no RP part is so true, it's sad. RP is my favourite part about mmos, but I also like the idea of the world being dangerous so I rolled on both Grobb and DD. Both the servers kind of just became pvp servers. There is a little bit here and there but it's far and few.
---
im disappointed cause i thought u were gonna go all the way up and around to the top area but then u just stopped at the mob down below :d
---
Horde filth ruin everything
---
I used to play ally on Skeram as well and I gave up about a month after release.  I saw how things were going and after 30-35 it just became a huge pain in the ass to even level up.  I love PVP but man when you're out on the racetrack in 1k and you spin your camera around and see 5-15 horde at all times and zero alliance it's not fun at all lol.
---
The minmaxing nature of todays gameplay has completely destroyed and iconic wpvp event SS vs TM.
---
In p1 u culd read thread and forum posts about ppl talking how ss vs tm will be on 24/7. Its literally dead on my pvp server which is full and it died withim the first week even tho it had huge raids vs raids the first couple days. Ppl just figured out it wasnt efficient. I miss it tho and was hoping to keep doing it regularly. But what can u do. I know roam in 5 to 8 man grps around wpl, epl, sg, brm, bs, fw and ws. And that will also pbbly go away when bgs come out. RIP wpvp. But again what can u do. As an orc once said "times change".
---
this warrior is fucking trash unbelievable
---
Play it every day and have only logged onto retail once to get my anniversary pet.
---
Is it like action quake??
---
You're completely clueless about what happened, aren't you?
---
ah ok, so it redirects your camera if its free but if you're currently using it nothing happens?
---
Enjoy your pve war.
---
I've been saying that the past few years lol. People don't know how to properly use "I" "I am", and "I'm", they all just say "am", it makes them sound slow. People ALWAYS confuse "on" and "in", people have been getting dumber and dumber lately.
---
My favorite new classic experience was fishing with a 60 shaman. I was on my way to elite quests in the hinterlands and saw him at a pond. As a much lower level shaman I figured I go level my fishing and chat.
---
Dude was a bro. Talked for a while. Then I found a group for the elite quests and said goodbye.
---
About one minute in a huge group of Ally drove us out and I shouted to the shaman for help. I died, but we spent the next few hours reclaiming the questing area.
---
Epic times. Nothing to do with the content, just the world PvP.
---
The horde tried to fight at IF gates tonight and we chased them all the way to the dwarf starting zone.
---
How do you play the game for that long and not know this is how wpvp plays out? The situation in Classic isn't new, before warmode in BfA, it was the exact same shit on PvP servers. Wpvp has never been about having a fair fight, it's always been like this.
---
I've been looking forward to BGs since Classic was announced.  Next week is what I came home for :)
---
It was fun til phase 2, sucked til i hit 60 and now sucks slightly less. Once Bgs come out Ill be much happier
---
Ok now do it every two hours for two weeks and come up with some actually meaningful data
---
No because low pop servers don’t have the brackets high pops do or something like that, read it here a week ago or so.
---
Congrats, horde attracts the degenerates of WoW. Some prize you’ve won.
---
How is he the asshole for wanting to play the game? You have some real mental issues dude.
---
wpvp **is** fun though, but the wpvp that everyone remembers. Prior to P2, I had a ton of fights while leveling and even at 60 but P2 just has everyone traveling in packs and 1v1's are pretty much gone.  
---
Its mostly due to the fact that we're playing on megaservers. Once again blizz fucked it up.
---
I love the honor system.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
\&gt; shockingly profitable for how niche it is 
---
Found the RS3 life support :D
---
Don't worry. Horde queue times are still gonna be dreadful.
---
NugEnergy
---
Have had a couple great fights, winning 3v6, that kind of thing.  
---
Feel like a lot of people are "doing it wrong" when it comes to WPVP. You need to stay in smaller groups and use a group composition that makes sense. That's where the honor/fun is.
---
We did a 17 man ony last sunday wiped twice x) was hella fun ,.. and long xD
---
I'm Horde on whitemane and this is true lol
---
Well, according to all the comments on this subreddit, everyone went into the game with 100% perfect information about what classic was going to be like. Therefore, the horde chose to be on the high pop faction with braindead zerg pvp.
---
Im alliance, but the idea that 6k horde are allowed on a realm and there's 3k horde sat in an unmoving queue unable to get on for their raid night makes my skin crawl.
---
No, we're not lying. Server populations were well under 5k total players back in the day.
---
Even Blizzard has admitted this.
---
Yes thank you! Found a comment about it, but I couldn't find my own comment so I could delete it 😅
---
Nope
---
Are you fat fingering your RP walk bind?
---
You are playing the same game but not playing the game the same. That's something that is happening to classic. Everyone is trying to suggest fixes to the game when they need to realize this is the game, not what they think it should be. Don't hate the game hate the player.
---
You definitely missed a lot of quests. I was able to stay in the barrens until 20 and managed to do the same zones and got to 30. Try an addon for quests to find those pesky missing quests
---
Whoa this exists that’s dope
---
rolled through Hillsbrad as an alliance on my way to SFK for a loot run.
---
Glad I rolled on the RP server. I got a show instead of a headache.
---
Played it daily until world pvp happened.  Horde camped everywhere on our server.  The balance is so bad that we couldn’t mount any counter attack.  
---
It took about 2 hours to get from thorium point to LBD.  The second anyone resurrected they were instantly killed.  People say it will get better when battle grounds open.  Not sure.  
---
Since we stopped playing classic we’ve been playing retail.  It’s been a fun challenge.
---
Most people like me and new to wow and though, oh I like PVP I'll join this server. Because we legit knew nothing about the game. Had no knowledge on server size. 
---
6k people on the small areas make for a shitty time. Then you have people who thought it would be like vanilla. Which again the server pop is like 2-3x bigger, so it's just a shit show .
---
All of you who parrot the same response " duurrp PVP on a pvpppp" think that we've played for 15 years and we knew what to expect. When in reality nobody did. And not everyone gets enjoyment out of PVP. 
---
I agree that most people like the OP should just face the fact that they would be better off on a PVE and just reroll. I did it right after phase 2 came out and I have my mount on my warrior already. Rerolling isn't as bad as the OP makes it out to be. 
---
I moved away from some of my friends, but I already found a guild with some really badass people in it, and I'm glad I moved over. I'm back to enjoying the game like I was in phase one. And I can't wait for BGs to come out in a few days.
---
sorry but you're an idiot if you think 55:45 pop balance is 'bad'
---
As a player on Kirtonos this makes me nervous. We have basically the same population distribution and it sucks. I guess it isn't as bad as some of the other servers, though.
---
Just set class officers and put them all in a group pre raid and have em go over who can do what. Clears things up real quick
---
Gotta admit, that's pretty awesome
---
It's also pretty boring to steamroll people for 5-hrs without encountering any real resistance.
---
The extra +8 from Trueaim will do nothing if you're a gun-handling Dwarf, it's not even lowering the hit you'll need be a percent. Get [Voone's Vice Grips](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13963/voones-vice-grips) instead, but keep the Trueaim around as they're essentially 4% hit when using a bow/crossbow so can come in extremely valuable when your gear is lacking.
---
 the problem isnt #nochanges, the problem is server populations now are extreme compared to vanilla. 
---
In vanilla server technology did not allow 50k players to be playing on a server, in classic we have multiple servers with tens of thousands of population, it's too much on a pvp server.
---
I have spoken
---
Mana pots are a lifesaver at lower levels, the lower level pots sell for dirt cheap as well
---
With no alliance the horde by queues will be monstrous
---
Oh I agree with you, but unfortunately I think you're confusing Blizzard's best interest with our best interests. Blizzard cares about making money, and I know what you're thinking, "But higher subscriptions = more money!" and it might, in the long term. But companies like Blizzard care about money on a quarterly basis to appease their stockholders.
---
You know what's a lot easier than implementing a new service (with questionable gains), hiring a team (or moving a team off other projects), and monitoring that service? Releasing Battlegrounds in the last quarter of the year.
---
As people like to point out, PvE realms tend to skew heavy Alliance. Its unlikely these players will be queuing up for PvP nearly as much.
---
The first few days, maybe the first week will be mild for Horde probably. But after that, the PvE BG "tourists" will lose their enthusiasm for it. Then I genuinely believe Horde queue times will be 20 minutes minimum. Probably more like 30-45.
---
played vanilla since like 2005.  classic is worse due to changes.  layering was horrible, thankfully my vanilla-pop realm hasn't suffered much for it.
---
play as much as i expected, lots.
---
xrealm battlegrounds gonna ruin it all, just retail 1.12, probably gonna start playing a lot less after i get rank 11, haven't decided to go for 13 or 14, def could tho.
---
Then I'd recommend questing wherever skull-level gankers aren't.
---
As someone who played alliance on the Illidan server, I am almost tempted to roll an alt there. 
---
Its hard to explain but when I was Illidan, as few as we were we'd all band together if horde were being extra nasty, plus we all knew each other. It was nice in a way
---
Well if there are not at least 167 alliance getting 15 hks in a week it would mean that rank 14 is impossible for that week. If the number ever dropped to 62 or lower people getting 15 hks on the alliance the. Rank 13 becomes impossible too.(25,14,8,5 are the cutoffs for ranks 12,11,10 and 9 too)
---
This happened a couple times to me while leveling (I believe because of the name I chose, couldnt think of another reason i had a few specific leveling squads gank and camp me and ignore everyone else lol) but tbh after they killed me a couple times i'd make it to an annoying out of the way area with lots of sneaky holes and stuff to hide around (i was priest so i could actually run a bit by shield/heal/dispel etc) and then just go and make a nice cup of tea or something :) one time i came back to the game 45 minutes later-ish and they were still there but i got away to the camp nearby haha. Made them sit for almost an hour of their lives for nothing at all and I was just having a nice cuppa tea and some biscuits the whole time lol :D
---
Okay, choose a new class, sure. How do you do their new gear? Offset pieces?
---
20 hours a week means that’s your main or only hobby, assuming you actually keep a healthy lifestyle and routine outside of the game. It’s equivalent to 2hrs/day during the week and 5hrs/day on weekends. For perspective, imagine someone spending 20 hours a week working out at the gym. Just because it’s a lot easier to sit in a chair and press a few buttons for hours doesn’t change the amount of free time it consumes.
---
I’d be interested to see what Blizzard’s data distribution on weekly time played looks like.
---
I know right? They want the population to stay high but they also want the alliance to log all day every day and be a glorified NPC for them to gank/farm honor.
---
And anybody saying it's "just for rank" is so full of it. People are out in force killing anyone/everyone of every level in every contested zone. It's a nightmare.
---
That's pretty sweet if true. I'll have to investigate further. A 3% boost would definitely be good. I wonder whether it can beat the agility enchant though.
---
These images/memes are actually getting so sad :(
---
I'm on Faerlina and there are too many horde as it is (I believe the last census was 55%-45%). My alt servers are probably on dead alliance or horde dominated servers as it is.
---
Horde members, it's sometimes fun to be on the alliance :)
---
Alliance members, hold fast. We lost Swifty from Faerlina the other day...but we can prevail. Dont give up and move to low pop because it will be the same horde alliance gap.
---
I used to play private servers and they always died when one faction took over. Dont let it die. Play both sides. Dont bandwagon. Play what makes you happy!
---
Hirumaredx on YouTube
---
ngl, this look fun. would roll a toon on your side but your economy must fucked.
---
Ready unsubbed. It was fun while it lasted.
---
Well being new to the game is a whole different situation then its just unlucky, but you learn from your mistakes like you did.
---
Vanilla was different as the vast majority surely had no idea about how good the racial were compared to each other when initially choosing a race.
---
Yes - and it certainly says something about personality choosing the faction that has it much easier a) due to the racial and b) due to the expected heavy population overweight, no?!
---
"im in a pvp area and mad bc i keep getting stomped" grow tf up...
---
can you retards fuck off with these old school runescape comparisons? different game different devs. it's entirely fucking irrelevant whether or not the runescape devs can make a gokd game. we're talking about wow and blizzard here.
---
With only 10 tanks on the server, reputation will finally matter!
---
As a holy pally healer, what weapon/off hand etc combo should I be looking for? Is there a 2 handed weapon that gives extra healing? Or should I be looking for something else?
---
No, they are normal player and scumbag forsaken
---
Common on fast mobs. Some mobs run at 300%-400% normal speed when feared, and they'll often run so far out that they'll reset, especially if they're also fleeing at the end of the fear because of dots.
---
Atleast you didn't pay for the boat. Would be a double whammy.
---
Did you finish all of shimmering flats? Also nothing wrong with grinding mobs.  Shimmering flats is such an under rated zone, and grinding snapjaw turtles there is also a pretty decent gold making plan for your level.  The shells they drop sell for 9s a pop, and with their low movement speed they can be muted fairly easily.
---
orcpean, a true intellectual. Wonder who hes gonna pvp when theres no alliance left.
---
Or just fucking append the realm name/abbreviation onto the end of the character name. But only show it on other players screens, so unless you run into someone with your same name, you have no idea.
---
Pretty sure that's what they do in retail, can't be that hard lol.
---
My 2 cents: start a new toon there and if paid transfer is available take your main there too.
---
I also wanna move from my shitty server, this is what I plan to do.
---
Nty
---
Yeah im sure it took a lot of skill to beat the other faction 50v1
---
That orc with the name overkill made bust to laugh
---
Kargath. Just be careful not to kill npcs inside the hut. They will give you dhk’s. Kargath always has horde that are solo or afk.
---
Incendius is one of the most balanced servers we got. It’s closest to 45 55 than 90% of the servers
---
They already confirmed that it will be cross realm.
---
No one to blame but themselves for leaving.
---
I believe the issue lies in population control.
---
If Blizzard applied a faction cap rather than a total server cap, servers would begin to balance out.
---
Most servers are unbalanced, causing wait times for all players and the underdog is being overrun by the opposing team (Horde or Alliance, the overpopulated team is guilty).
---
If the underdog had 0 wait time and the Zerg had all the wait time, this alone will allow max possible players for the underdog. In the long run, hopefully, Blizzard would allow the overpopulated faction to change servers, further balancing the population issues we're all experiencing. 
---
Back in the day, server populations were around 3k.   Now we're looking at \~15k.  That's \~5 times the MAX population that we all remember from Classic. 5 times the players in each area, 5 times as many doing the same quests or camping BRD...
---
I'll just hope for the best but, expect little to actually be done.
---
my server in vanilla ended up with this later in vanilla - a couple people kept a list and we had an order and we had max amounts we should get. we kept the numbers lower so people didn't have to lose their lives, and the risk to disobeying was everybody else going back to a hard grind and destroying your individual rank. it worked surprisingly well, but was not implemented until sometime in 2006
---
I heard no
---
On top of that make a bank alt with bags to hold all the ores + cloth you get leveling so bag space isn’t an issue.
---
Also only go engi if you’re wanting to min max. It won’t make you much gold. If you’re playing casually I’d invest time into something to make passive gold like alchemy.
---
Haven't they lost a shitload since BFA?
---
Layering hid the problem immensely. 
---
I had a lot of fun in phase 1, a lot of 1v1s in STV leveling and around the world. Rarely that outnumbered. Its a completely different game in p2 with the removal of layers.
---
Umm... Good luck with that...
---
That is definitely not 200 yards, more like 100y. Basically, what render range is right now, except without the huge lags that delays it by 1-3 seconds.
---
Actually my post doesn't state that in the slightest. What I SAID since you obviously didn't read it. Was that 1) there is a faction imbalance and 2) that the first time estimate is assuming that people participating in battlegrounds do so in the same proportion as faction balance. Unfortunately we KNOW that HORDE pvp more. Notice how each of those lines say "PARTICIPATION". Well obviously not.
---
To put it simply for those that struggle and making an inference. Based on straight faction balance with ONLY WSG and assuming 20 minute WSG games, queue times would be 6-7 minutes for Horde. It is likely to be skewed even further than faction balance. I then simply used the same exact assumptions and shifted faction balance, for estimating queue times.
---
You are just seeking an argument, but failing to read.
---
The data is from Ironforge.pro. So you should probably go and look at it again.
---
And I call BULLSHIT on you ever seeing Alliance in the US servers being the dominant faction. The 8 largest servers are horde dominated. 10 of the top 12 servers are Horde dominated. 26 of the 38 Classic servers are horde dominated. Even if you go to All time rather than the last 2 weeks, The 8 largest servers are horde dominated, 10 of the top 12 servers are horde dominated. 24 of the 38 servers are horde dominated.
---
But you must have miss read something, it is okay happens all the time to those looking for an argument, rather than actually thinking.
---
I think i found taliesin. 😳
---
When BGs come out it will be super easy to get Rank14 there because there is no competition.
---
Server queues, faction transfers are an easy start. If your server is 60/40 the dominant faction waits in a queue or has the option to transfer factions . Or blizzard could have seen this coming and worked to balance the servers better though faction only realm transfers and more server availability.
---
You know it literally existed in vanilla, right?
---
No.
---
Why do you assume everyone is playing classic wow because they didn’t play vanilla before expansions?
---
I did. Tons of people did. It’s why we’re playing it, not because we didn’t.
---
Sounds like you’re just a retail and only speak for people who already give blizzard their money.
---
These (not you) are the kind of players they were talking about with the “you think you do but you don’t” comment. Not to say there wasn’t an appetite for Vanilla WoW but that the average player today was not going to like it.
---
can you imagine a joke
---
If you have a guildy you trust, give them your login info and have them transfer
---
Gonna disagree with you there.
---
Prot dps is terrible. Your healer shouldn't need to dps, a waste of mana that could easily cause a wipe when someone asks pulls. Your comment about class design sounds like you just made it up, and it doesn't back up your assertion about prot dps.
---
Considering fury warriors are the best dps in the game, prot is even worse by comparison.
---
i feel bad for horde that think theyre good because they have numbers on every server. rude awakening incoming when battlegrounds hit.
---
Amen, I have experienced that too on my level 50 warrior.
---
Open up faction changes and then set limits for balance.
---
I'm on a 55/45 and I'd happily switch to Alliance to even it out.
---
Come to bloodsail buccaneers. I'm on alliance side, we have an awesome community. But I'd also love to see more horde on the server too. We have alot of new players I call P2 refugees, and everyone is leveling now. 
---
Dunno about horde side, but my alliance boys are awesome. As soon as I rerolled dudes were chilling in elwynn passing out bags and pots for everyone. Super nice people.
---
TIL PvPing is griefing
---
I honestly thought I tabbed  to the enemy behind me or something
---
Or don’t sit up in the tower and literally get all those horde you missed, you’re already stealthed.
---
If blizzard had capped the servers early on there would have been thousands of dead servers 2 months in.
---
by knowing you can get scammed you are already ahead of the curve, just pay attention. if you are a scammer asking if you can get away with it, fuck you.
---
This is what happens when you all tryhard obsessive behavior run its course, and unfortunately those type of people gather mostly on the Horde. Let this server stand as a lesson to everyone if we let such behavior go unchecked along with Blizzard’s apprehension to get involved at facilitating sensible fair play.
---
Took my pug group 6 hours
---
I think this is the case in all instances. Next time you're in MC, pay attention and you'll notice you see mobs from much farther away. Idk if this is the case in dungeons though.
---
Looks like there are more horde than alliance in ironforge.
---
Did it happened to be 13 minutes ago?
---
Blizzards stance on customer support for classic has been super disheartening. I’m fortunate to not have had any issues thus far but I keep seeing citations of “hands off cause classic nochanges” but if they were really “nochanges” the GMs would assist with services following better policies from the days of old
---
Seems like a shitty copout to have maybe 1 GM servicing an entire region of tickets armed with copy/pastes of “classic is meant to have consequences” bullshit
---
wpvp is complete trash. im horde as well i think it sucks on both sides. cant believe they didnt just release bgs from the start of phase 2
---
Really?
---
It would have made more sense (in practical hindsight) to put the Night Elf city in Moonglade, and the Druid sanctuary in Teldrassil. Put a tunnel or flight path down to Darkshore and away you go. Would make flying down from Moonglade to Ratchet/Theramore via Ashenvale a lot less insane.
---
I was in the top 5 of my class after the first 1-2 days on Bigglesworth. Very few people around. No items in the economy that I could use. Levelling the alt was quite different, thankfully as a warrior I just spammed dungeons
---
No where in my post hints that I’m trying to get away with scamming. I lose rolls on gear, so I just buy my gear.
---
and I get to see them for the first time Jan 22nd! Super fucking excited
---
Everyone’s definition of asshole will be different.
---
It’s really just a matter of perspective.
---
People can corpse camp if they want to brotha! It just might not be worth any honor, or be honorable.
---
I had two Rank11s and one Rank13 in Vanilla and if I had one wish before Classic Release I would have changed the PvP-System. I knew it was bad, everyone knew it.
---
I feel like the #NoChanges Morons were people who never played in Vanilla like Asmongo, Tibstard etc...
---
I would do a class switch to Alliance if I could. I'm not leveling again.
---
I'm literally in engineering.  I never have as much data as I'd like, but it's way better working with what we do have with the knowledge that it's not perfect than to just stare at our empty hands.
---
Literally what the hell has Blizzard done to make you think they care at all about server balance?
---
Flamelash is highly populated even after all the alliance left
---
In TBC Shaman tanks had this utility + some more. I loved to tank then as a Shaman, it felt like Blizz was going to make them real tanks in WOTLK. But the fuckers didnt but instead introduced the rogue tanks (Death knights) which were absurdly OP for the first 6 months.
---
If Shamans totem agro would have been added onto their threat and they had gotten a separate taunt, they would have been ok tanks.
---
Roll a pally and get rocket boots as an engy.
---
Any chance you could send me a SS of what this looks like?
---
Do the math on the damage output. Battles are typically over a long period of time, so long term sustained damage is what you are looking for. Bleeds do that really well.
---
A lot of big bosses are immune to stuns anyways.
---
This dudes logic is unassailable. Try it, you won’t
---
But everyone wants the best, they just didn’t know better
---
Good
---
Back in BC in arena 2's on my lock I got 8 shadowtrance procs in a row. Felt bad for the priest i murdered with them lol
---
at lower levels it is more important to drop curse recklessness rank 1 on mobs that run away in fear. as well as casters with curse of tongues. seducing for cc and banishing demons and elements as openers and then basically dps rotation:
---
corruption -&gt; shadow bolt -&gt; sould drain
---
Seeing as the correct answer - no you can’t - has been posted, I’ll add on that you can buff your fellow faction if their gryphon/wyvern gets close enough as a fun fact
---
Sad part is, most of the people in that picture aren't even playing on that server, and only made characters to check how bad it actually was. I would know, since that's what I did.
---
You'll always get less than the people who don't give a shit about the people on the other side.
---
If farming FPs wasn't efficient, people wouldn't do it. The reality is it's extremely efficient.
---
Don't use other people's unhappiness as a reason for your happiness. That is a pretty good definition.
---
Actually 0,0025% chance.
---
I'm confused. Are you bitching about faction imbalances or because you don't want to pvp on a pvp server?
---
that also happened all the time in normal vanilla
---
You're not gonna randomly find one. You gotta invest some time to even see one.
---
Been on AR since I started classic on horde side I really like this server wish economy was a little better but welcome we're glad to have you
---
....?
---
Spoken like a true brainless  Blizztard. gooo boyo. try to find some neurons to work with.
---
You're not worried about the stability of a server without Alliance? I'm pretty worried that we're headed the same direction on Stalagg.
---
I play on a horse dominated server and alliance own BRM. Every raid night they camp choke points and cause 3-5 death runs to get in.
---
The reality is people enjoy making other people suffer in video games for their own amusement. Players can complain but they need to realise its not horde vs alliance, it's people vs people.
---
&gt; It is literally people exploiting the game and flight points or camping someone over and over and over again when they have to way to stop it WAY past the point when they become worthless for honor.
---
AKA world pvp
---
The hardcore farmers don't just stop farming. You're the one looking at this incorrectly. 
---
I AM looking at the big picture here.
---
And your second paragraph is just nonsense. After everyone is pre-raid bis (took our raiders about 2 weeks of a few runs a night, its not that hard) , there is very little to do that is relevant to raiding outside raids. 
---
Again, who farms gold the hardest solo, gets the most raid loot, is a horrendously awful and stupid system for a guild.
---
not default ElvUI, i altered it to my liking.
---
Alliance players generally don't engage in PvP as much, so in practice when you go out in Searing Gorge it's 20:80 at best. And when it's 20:80, that devolves into 5:95 pretty quickly.
---
You knew the conditions when you signed up, you knew that people could kill you because that's what a PVP server is, you also know there's no mechanic in place for faction balancing so you could be outnumbered? You know that people have beat you to level 60, and you know that there is nothing stopping them from killing anybody lvl 48 and above. If you know these factors exist and out of sheer stubbornness you decide to go ahead and play a PVP server anyway then you have forfeited your right to complain about getting ganked, you have brought the pain upon yourself.  
---
As OP posted this with a Humor/Meme Tag, I'm guessing he is one of those who don't care that they were ganked, and see it as part of the overall WoW experience.
---
If I'm honest it doesn't really make a difference to me. The economy will be fine eventually and I'll be sat in BGs all day. I can do that on any server.
---
I had lots of fun with WPvP in Phase 1. There would be fights with random Horde and Alliance grouping up to chase each other out of quest hot spots and such. Plenty of times taking out bigger groups than my own, or duoing a skull, or getting our asses handed to us by players who player better. *That* was fun.
---
The min/max mentality of camping FPs/boats/instance portals or wandering a zone in a gank squad to literally *grind* lone players for PvP rank isn't fun. If I go anywhere in the world during prime time, there is a 100% chance of the FP or boat being camped by three rogues or an entire raid. Having to go to out of the way FPs or locations to avoid the camping to try and turn in quests or grind anything for gold isn't fun. Taking an hour to get everyone to the instance because of all the gank squads and FP campers is so very very far from fun. I've stopped logging in nightly like I use to. I basically got rank 3, bought my mount and I'll hop on when BGs drop because everything else is currently a waste of my time with all the griefing. There is zero point for me to log in only to chain corpse run places where I spend the majority of my time as a ghost.
---
Are you blaming ...the players? Are you that fucking dense? unreal...
---
I agree. The only civilian you should kill is the flight master.
---
Your text is all facked up!
---
&gt; How is it the horde's fault that they're doing what the game encourages?
---
*Why didn't Blizzard do something to stop me! WTF Blizzard??* ~ The Horde mentality
---
In vanilla, Shaman and Paladin are by far the two coolest classes. Sucks that I can't play both on the same server.
---
Obviously warriors are the best tanks overall. A lot seem to think druids are better for dungeons (if that’s what you’re wanting to cover) and I don’t disagree, but nothing severe enough to warrant choosing one over a warrior in my opinion. Problem with druids is you don’t have much other options if you wanted to go a different route than tanking later other than resto. Although that would prove to be a versatile alt for you and friends along with leveling easier.
---
If you’re warrior tanking the best advice is to rotate sunders on every mob and keep up demo shout up. What you actually end up doing is marking one target with a skull and let dps nuke it while you rotate sunders on all other targets.
---
Hit cap so taunts don’t resist on either way you go.
---
Problem with xrealm is how it's implemented. PvE servers are 65/35 A/H ratio and PvP servers are 65/35 H/A ratio (overall). If battlegroups are clumping PvE servers together and PvP servers together then the queues will still be huge.
---
&gt; So we have Alliance players that are blaming Horde for being dickwads, when in reality Alliance is doing the same thing on the very few Alliance dominated servers...
---
My dude please stop talking. I've been playing this game for decades, for both factions. Horde is FAR more aggressive. Even on alliance dominated realms the griefing is kept to a minumum for horde players. The races and mystique of the horde naturally draws in these types of players and no matter how much people cry about perspective this is the truth.
---
Horde players literally become famous for being griefers. Redridge Boss? 
---
The only people saying shit like "there's 2 sides to the coin guizzz" are predominately horde players and don't actually play both factions. 
---
Yeah it sounds nice, but the reality is horde are more obnoxious. 
---
And no I am not salty, I play on a roughly 50/50 split realm and the worst I get is when I am trying to get to DMT for the buffs once a week. And we havent lost even a single member while doing the MC run for the past several weeks, even though there is usually a bunch of horde waiting there. 
---
If you have no idea what you're talking about don't try to be the "voice of reason". Horde is definitely more obnoxious when it comes to mass ganking and always has been. Right up until the human trinket was introduced the vast majority of PVP focused players were horde, that's obviously another major reason why it feels like no matter what realm you are on, horde are almost always more obnoxious.
---
Yeah because they're probably the people not bothered enough by it to come post on reddit and are playing the game or are the ones ganking your ass.
---
I'm a .72 horde
---
more dead than feenix LUL
---
I would 100% do this at a LAN, it's part of the game, therefore I will enjoy it.   
---
If you don't enjoy it you have two options, go to a PVE server or play a new game, you are not bound to this game and forced to sit there being tortured, you have chosen to play and you got ganked, it's not the end of the world.
---
You gonna get so much hate but yea you absolutely right. Av is going to suck
---
Interesting. Well, best of luck. I suppose you're the guinea pig server for the rest of the super imbalanced servers so I'll be sure to keep and eye on Reddit for updates lol.
---
Quick someone fireball this guy
---
&gt; The modern player has changed. People don't play games the same way they did it in 2003. The methods are refined, content has been explored, it's all about efficiency now.

I keep seeing this concept brought up as a reason to make modifications to the core gameplay of Classic, when the entire idea of WoW Classic was to return to that gameplay. If anything, PvP and the game in general seem more relaxed now. In Vanilla, players lacked the technology and knowledge to be efficient, so efficiency was prized. Now, Wowhead and addon support make many previously difficult tasks trivial. 
---
Perhaps its just our respective individual experiences in Vanilla and Classic, but gank squads, area denial, Honor whoring, city camping, hardcore efficiency farming, raiding, gear elitism, and even forum drama are the reasons I keep coming back to WoW. These are emergent results of a game structure that the WoW community loudly demanded Blizzard return to. 
---
In a new epoch of game-development-by-whiny-community, WoW classic stands as an example of what popularity a well constructed game can still achieve by forcing players to adapt to a proven model, instead of cowing to complexity and competition killing mechanics that make a quick buck.
---
The modern player hasn't changed so much as the body of experience, addons, social media, and support apps/websites have made WoW easier. Personally, I all see the same old tricks that I returned for.
---
They will take the gold off the scammer, but won’t return it to you.
---
I do this on the chain over the lava in BRD. They can't swim fast enough to the shore so die in lava it's great.
---
It's incredibly different, sigh. 
---
One system asks you to show up to 4 hours of raids a week, and everyone gets a roughly equal shot at loot. 
---
The gold bid system allows someone to solo farm gold 40 hours a week, and have a massive advantage in acquiring raid loot. 
---
Why is this so hard to understand?
---
No seller is going to let that happen for the very same reason
---
I want to leave because the server offers no gameplay at all. 
---
I’m not 60. I have a job. I only play on the weekends. 
---
There are plenty of other games to occupy my time. This is just tedious, and it’s not fun. 
---
I’ve unsubbed until I can level my character to 60.
---
See I think the "always need something to do" is the REAL "you think you do but you don't". We really don't need constant stuff Todo and I thing the success of classic is a good example of that despite the minority squabble
---
It's definitely going to be interesting to see how it all plays out yeah. Good luck to you guys on Stalagg too.
---
Easy : the 16 year old is just a slave lvling his characters!
---
Probably Goblins tbh.
---
He’s not asking them to share.
---
Pointing out something is on Fire is t the same as asking someone to throw gasoline on it.
---
I'm not saying they should have made thousands of servers.  They should have had around 30 from the start.  The problem is, they only had like 5 when name reservations started.  They only made new ones when those had reached 20k+ name reservations.  I understand the point was to try to avoid dead servers, but they grossly underestimated how many people were going to stick around.

---
Its not ridiculous if the guild is looking to do speed clears.
---
My guild does one speed clear and month and split raids every other week. Split clears allows meme specs or whatever and we just go for loot and to chill, while speed clears require consumables, optimized specs/gear/etc.
---
I would agree though if my guild was not doing any speed clears or parsing and was just clearing each week. I can stay arms 3/4 of the month and have no issues bc the content is so easy.
---
it was fun for a month, then i stopped im currently saving up for a new gpu.
---
Again, as I said to someone else, the farmers don't just stop farming. Your 200g split per week won't mean shit to the person farming 1k a week. 
---
Please use some logic. Do you guys really think the hardcore farmers just farm for one week then stop?
---
Then don’t complain when you get corpse camped and can’t get into BRM. Lol
---
No, it literally didnt. Race changes did not exist in Vanilla.
---
this dudes username might be generated for all i know, sry for not stalking him. best protection against being scammed is being aware of it, that is true for scamms in the real world as well.
---
Earthshaker is 100% gonna die like flamelash now. I've been on all day and the world chat has been completely spammed by questions about the server from different people
---
Had a bet with my guild about how long it would take all the classic shills to turn on themselves and come back to retail. About 6 months or less
---
It’s common sense. 
---
There are horde camping everywhere with three times the alliance numbers. 
---
I don’t know why anyone expected them to continue to be punching bags, outnumbered three to one. 
---
Nah, I’d rather play any one of my hundreds of other games. I survived 15 years without playing, I can wait it out. Saves me money in the long run, too. Win/win.

---
I don't man. I saw will of the forsaken and knew. Before they nerfed the shot out of it, it was way overpowered. Still one of the best though. I picked horde cause that's what I favored in Warcraft.
---
Oh I did 100%, I knew as soon as they announced the phasing. Because it’s happened on pservers before. This is what happens when you have the honor system before BGs.
---
Hehe that reminds me when my guild was in a 5man group 35-40 helping with warrior quest near SS before going to SM up the river and there was a battle going on and all these level 60s surrounding our tonga line (most were on follow) waving us through as all these PvPers lie dead in the field. Being able to choose when to die is so lovely.
---
Not really. I’d recommend finding a guild like mine that does one speed clear a month with everyone proper geared and specced and all consumables, and the rest split runs where you can be meme specs or PvP specs or whatever and just run for gear.
---
Arms takes up precious debuff spots that could be used for more important things than mortal strike
---
Or just call it quits, it was fun to comeback for a while and ill play bgs for a week but overall i just have that meh feeling i always got playing later expansions of retail
---
No, it's not.....sighhhhhh. 
---
One system values time spent raiding, with a hardcap on how much attendance can be gained. 
---
The gold bid system rewards no-life farmers, with no cap whatsoever on time spent. On a activity that has nothing to do with raiding whatsoever. 
---
I swear to god simple, basic logic has just left orbit on this topic.
---
spoken like a true huntard. oh man this is priceless.
---
Very helpful. Thanks.
---
If you think blizzard is going to increase the view for distance live moving objects good luck. The current servers can’t even manage 80 players within 40 yards of each other without shitting a brick
---
So butt hurt, turn your pvp off ya cucks...
---
There’s always one guy
---
Correct.
---
relevant
---
Hopefully you deleted yours and sold the unbound one.
---
With raid loot having a 2 hour trade window it would probably behoove you to do the trading via the trade window with the loot rather than paying the master looter.
---
Because I expect to get raid loot for raiding, not farming gold solo. 
---
Apparently a crazy concept.
---
it's the same game (just about), but the community is very very different to that of vanilla
---
two accounts, unsubbed once phase 2 hit
---
It was ok. Killed the bosses, got rank 4, now unsubbed. Just lurking forums. Maybe resub in the future, but for now I'm bored so I gquit and gave out my gold. Not touching it again til after phase 3 or 4 if ever.
---
That's mine now, thanks!
---
See above on why this is a logical fallacy, dont feel like typing it again.
---
I'ma stop right at "blame #nochanges"
---
The concept for Classic is simple: WoW, as it was, when it came out. Corners cut to get things moving, of course, but the core experience is basically a "second chance" to participate in the first few expansions for those who didn't or couldn't, whether that's because they didn't know, didn't care, or didn't exist.
---
Blaming Blizzard sucks here too, cause this is an entirely new team of developers in charge of server transfers at the moment. They didn't know that it would hurt the game this badly to not faction-restrict the transfers.
---
PPM is a measure of how many procs per minute you have gotten. It's a mechanic in everything ever? It's just how we talk about the math behind an item. You're thinking of ICD, Item Internal Cooldown.
---
Generic flex post, but I'm just hype af to have finally gotten this guy after lots of fishing grind.
---
Doesnt the fact that all your friends quit tell something?
---
Do 1 quest run SFK, some RFK and some SMGY and you should be 32ish
---
That’s all well and good, but you saying so does nothing thing to alleviate the concern that your just looking to scam and people.  If you were it’s not like you would be honest about it when asked.
---
Fucking spawn campers are the worst.
---
I'm planning on joining my guild on their third (and my first) MC run. Which consumables should I prepare for the raid? Apart from bandages and potions? I'm a hunter
---
Bahahahaha
---
Theres basically no alliance playing anymore, everybody was scared they would be left behind so they all migrated today.
---
Flamelash Alliance is making it seem like this was the worst server there is for the alliance, but we weren't even in top 3 most imbalanced servers in eu. 
---
Well now we are. Not that a common horde here care much, we don't need alliance for anything. WPvP was boring anyway. And entering MC without a wipe seems good to me.
---
You’re supposed to do silver pine till like 12 then hit barrens till 15-18. After that sprinkle head back to silver pine and close it out. Sprinkle some stone talon some where in there
---
It is. HotW makes up for not having a large mana pool and is very resilient at all levels of being a druid. Once you're out of quest greens/blues and have some of the nicer blues and a few epics you can absolutely switch.
---
New to wow, didn't know phase 2 would be this bad. So I rerolled pve. Just got my mount on my warrior on the new server 2 days ago and am having as much fun as I was in phase 1. So all is good
---
As a 57 holy priest I started healing Mc weekly until I was 60, you'll do fine! I found no problems getting groups as a healer to me getting into dungeons as a lower level is a healer perk.
---
"Nah, you’re right. Dependability and honoring your commitments is for losers. You’re above that, and it’s all about instant gratification and fucking people over, as long as you come out ahead and sacrifice nothing, right? "      
---
Maybe you shouldn't throw stones.
---
It's amazing, everyone should play on a PVE server. If you want to PvP, you can PvP, just flag up and go to the right zones, you'll find combat. If you don't wanna PvP, the world is yours and no one is gonna stop you. It's absolute bliss. 
---
And here I was for 15 years playing PvP servers thinking anything else was for RPers and cowards. Completely ignorant.
---
it has a timed opening as well...... after some time (its a bit lengthy) the gates auto open......
---
Happened on a few vanilla realms that had been low pop
---
Skinning is still insanely fast to level because it's such an abundant resource, especially in places good for certain types of leather from multiple sources. I think I hit 300 skinning around level 30 just because I was doing it all the time. 300 leatherworking was surprisingly a pain in the ass until I got a few choice high level patterns that helped me more easily go from ~250 to the last couple of levels.
---
Yeah he's not a very epic gamer
---
Alliance are so salty... you want to faction imbalance? Make some friends and roll ally. Otherwise stop complaining to blizz. They can't make people roll the lesser faction.
---
There's quite a lot of messy things that happen from both faction transfer let alone a class change.   
---
None are insurmountable though. Many people got their accounts hacked in 2005-2007 and at that stage a 'retrieval/restoration' meant waiting 3+ months and getting back a brand new level 60 character in greens with no rep. People survive. It is a far better outcome then having the game completely die do to ridiculous faction imbalance.  
---
Practically speaking I would probably make 5 different levels of gear for a lvl 60 and you get slotted into the most appropriate one for a nominated spec, with a special box for how many bits of T1/T2/or Rag/Ony level wep you have. It probably would be too much effort to make that for every single class spec I guess, so maybe just straight Pally &lt;--&gt; Shaman would be better in that case.
---
Interesting! Does that only apply to phase 1 raids? Or will mages still perform well with non-raid gear throughout all phases?
---
Hunter's Survival talent [Entrapment](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19390/entrapment):  Gives your Immolation Trap, Frost Trap, and Explosive Trap a 25% chance to entrap the target, preventing them from moving for 5 sec. 
---
The most popular use with this talent is, I assume, Frost trap.  I've been experimenting with Immolation Trap which, upon trapping, puts a dot on the target for X amount of time.  Is this DoT expected to proc entrapment?
---
Between Explosive and Immolation trap, I've seen explosive trap's DoT proc, but it's unreliable as the DoT does not stick -- it requires the target to be in the area of the trap after it's triggered.
---
Bug or not?
---
Because they were playing on private servers before.
---
It's really stupid how imbalanced the classes are in PVP.
---
As a mage I was kind of with him till I realized he was a Mage.
---
I’m 100% for givinf Warriors dual spec as some kind of class feature - like, after a long hard quest instead of the pally/lock epic mount.
---
How does any of that affect the fact that, eventually, you’re getting gear for nothing?
---
Plus you’re making gold while you wait for the other folks to farm out. It’s better than joining an established guild and not getting gear for a lot time and not getting gold.
---
I’ve read this three times decided you’re illiterate
---
Couldn't agree more, game went from an MMO RPG to a Meta fest. I never remembered so many dwarf priests back in the day.
---
except the alliance on herod actually group up and fight back. until they get zerged down, which is when they move on to ganking other zones.
---
also known as playing the game. not sure what the rest of the alliance is doing crying on reddit for.

Soon all pvp servers will have 100-0 populations with one side getting completely wiped out.

&gt; Do we even know if PvP servers and PvE servers will be in the same battlegroup?
---
Most likely. [It used to be that way in Vanilla](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Battlegroup) at least.
---
Before you go into the raid type /combatlogging.
---
On retail, some PvP realms, i.e. Illidan US and Mal'Ganis US, got to absurd Horde:Alliance ratios, as in 20:1+ ratios. It was so lopsided that those realms have more Blood Elves than total Alliance players.
---
Yeah, when we go raid we don’t move to mc until the whole group is there lol
---
With servers as large as they are in classic, people are going to be (literally) killing themselves to hit R14, especially early on.  There’s just far too many people to ever come to this sort of agreement; it’s gonna be a complete shitshow.
---
They fixed a ton with balance in TBC and introduced arenas. You can still grind out PvP gear in battlegrounds but for the good gear you need to rank high in arena play (2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 I think were the options) with an ELO style system. They gave all of the classes more utility. They basically made it a viable competitive game. The balanced professions also... Just all around fantastic xpac with my only gripe being that they introduced a lot of really cool and interesting world PvP objectives but flying mounts made it so that you couldn't really participate properly.
---
Yes. EVERYTHING must be logged in game and clearly defined. Do not discuss ANYTHING outside of game.
---
i went druid.  love the versatility.
---
The corpse run was so great. Well done.
---
On a medium populated server (~5000), would mean 2750 Horde, to 2250 Alliance.  A 500 character difference.  That surplus is alone is over 20% the entire population of alliance.  Math its easy for some of us.
---
GL Hf on a pvp server when you ding 48.
---
you see rogues? something is up for sure...
---
on a serious note, undead rogues are a meme for over a decade now... this surely isn't a classic thing
---
No they aren't all horde dominant. Across all realms pop is basically 50/50
---
It’s the thresholds are exponential. But you may also be earning honor more efficiently if you are doing 1v1s. The people spending the entire weekend killing 100 different people 5 times while in a 15 man raid don’t know how the system works and are wasting their entire weekend.
---
This guy could lead an army

I am having fun.

Ok, so you’re THAT guy.
---
Right? Am I going crazy? An hour isn’t even enough time for some dungeons, let alone finding a group and traveling. I’m not trying to judge casual players, I’m pretty casual myself. But averaging an hour a day and WoW do not go well together.
---
Queue timers would've worked if they had it to begin with. Nobody will reroll now, they'll only bitch about the queue if that happened.  
---
That's what private servers (mostly) did and that kept the server from being too one-sided.
---
Fair enough.
---
I found out the problem. It had to do with some random glitch with my keyboard or something. Basically what I think happened is the game running at say 60fps, but my keyboard only sending inputs at 30fps or something. When I took out the usb and plugged it back in it was fixed.. If only I had thought of that after reinstalling and trying out various shit for 2 hours lol
---
I had to do this. Join BB!
---
So your just shilling for asmo? Oof
---
You should be banned, you toxic git.
---
&gt; It's not that big a deal to reroll considering how little content there is to do at 60 once you have your BIS
---
Getting my pre-raid Best in Slot is what's taking most of my time so it feels like I've got a lot of content left. I've yet to even step foot in a raid and it feels like I've still got some Dire Maul wings left.
---
&gt;  you’re not bandaging during Iceblock, that’s on you?
---
you think he needs to sit in iceblock in a duel? lmao
---
he's still at 100% hp lmao
---
he can end it anytime he wants... I usually do just to force the canceling so they get less cooldowns reseting but if its in a group situation and they want to survive, then its in their favor to hold out in 20 seconds of back to back iceblocks
---
Yah Perp definitely uses every dirty trick in the book, but it's still a very well executed fight where he doesn't make a single mistake against Goth.  
---
The second video is Dusch fighting a rogue in one of his Grand Marshall mash ups and the fights kind of go the same - but it's more realistic to what a duel looks like because there are several of them shown and both sides make mistakes.
---
Imma laugh when it comes out. I hope that the horde overpop in general fucks over the spiky boys royally on queues. Would be hilarious.
---
So if I’m level 60 and I gank a level 60 I’m not an asshole? 
---
You’re right, it is very simple, you are mad at the game. If Blizz didn’t want to allow you to camp FPs then they would disallow it. In vanilla you can camp FPs so it stands that camping FPs is apart of classic, clearly the problem isn’t assholes, the problem is you don’t like classic.
---
Love the amount of blue names there, they'd rather complain than help kill the Horde.
---
If you have to have ask, *you'll never know...*
---
I knew it would be a problem but I didn't expect this. I didn't think server pop would be this high and didn't think there would be so many 60's with nothing to do but gank. Luckily my server is pretty even but questing/farming is impossible.  So I have no gold and still my lvl 40 mount - and some of my friends are stuck in their 50's trying to level
---
Saying the average player didn’t get better is nonsense.
---
People were mouse clicking and keyboard turning, like a huge majority of players. Now even bad players have their stuff bound and use macros, the average skill level absolutely has gone up.
---
Private servers have already shown us that even pre-nerf mc was not that difficult.
---
Additionally, it doesn't really make sense to count the first instance of nightfall as part of the calculation, and to instead say you had a 0.0625% chance to chain that sequence of events after the first proc.  
---
Counting the first instance of nightfall would be akin to rolling a 20 sided die over and over and then when you finally get 2 numbers in a row saying you had a 0.25% chance of that occurring.  Really, you had a 100% chance of rolling any number, then a 5% chance of rolling that number again.
---
I hope that makes sense.  I'm not trying to downplay the chances.  I just really like probabilities and statistics.
---
C'thun will be cleared less than four hours after AQ releases
---
Fair call, I'm surprised there haven't been any posts on here about people grouping together to help ferry people around heavily ganked areas. Kinda like the Fuel Rats in elite dangerous [https://fuelrats.com/](https://fuelrats.com/)
---
I feel like the distance got lessened around the time Honor came out. Definitely feels like it used to be further out.
---
The funniest part about this whole situation is that hundreds of horde have followed the flamelash alliance over to earthshaker...   Potential for a 2-0 win
---
i used no slurs it ended up being him falsely reporting me and getting banned himself
---
Give a 30 day notice that faction queues will be implemented across all servers. Then open up free transfers from servers with a greater than 60/40 faction split to servers with 40/60 splits. Allow free movement between all servers. If the majority factions refuse to switch then they deal with queues and have had plenty of warning.
---
i couldn't believe that whole spiel was serious at first.
---
Personal Bar tab, left column under Health Bar:  Power Bar - check it enabled.  You can also try a wago mod:

P1 PvP was a ton of fun. The rewards of PvP should be organic. I get to farm these mobs, or this rare spawn, or don’t have to wait for a quest mob respawn, or I get this mining node. The honor system is trash though and encourages and rewards entirely the wrong behaviors.
---
Took me 45 minutes to get from tp to ubrs today on herod

Not everyone publicly raid logs
---
The boys and I usally are hanging out in these places;
---
1. Azshara; Good for soloing if Azuregos is down, mostly ppl leveling or farming. 
---
2. Around Kargath, both in and out of the city and bottleneck between SG and Badlands. It can get very crowded real fast!  
---
3. Searing Gorge; South of The Cauldron, road from Badlands to BRM; Picking off solo runners, levelers and dodging ZERG 40man grps. 
---
4. Around the Bulwark, WPL or patroling the way between WPL and EPL (Sometimes this is better for solofarming, sometimes not..)
---
5. Winterspring or Silithus; Good for sologrinding because of the farmers.
---
6. Feralas, Tanaris, are also good locations if ur in a grp.
---
We\`re a couple of rogues in my guild who have been in UC the last couple of days and its quite fun. Not the best honor tho. We tried Org aswell, but after 4-5 kills we were shut down for hours lol. You could also try the zepplins, not sure how many 60s that still use them tho.
---
Personally I use it because I play a ranged clase and namteplate draw distance is horrible in Classic. I like to see the names of who I'm fighting to know what I'm getting into. There are already several people on my server from both factions that have developed a reputation as good PvPers and I look forward to fighting them a lot more than everyone else. :)
---
I didn't expect it to be as bad as it ended up, but I did expect it to be pretty damn unfun. Back in actual vanilla I recall a skull level Tauren (I think) camping Wetlands and just annihilating any of the low levels on the fairly heavily traveled road. (Nowadays I've become aware of the drown method as well as the reverse mountain method but I knew nothing of that back then.) The skull was positioned in such a way that the closest graveyard would always put your running progress back. I maybe was too stupid to figure out a corpse walk and res strategy that would work, but this guy really seemed to have ganking down to a science. I don't know if any high level alliance ever came to chase him away, but I can say that in Classic I basically never see people over level 30 - 40 at best in Wetlands. Anyways, point is remembering that skull ganking from over a decade ago and how frustrating it was pretty much singlehandedly made me roll PvE and not look back. And even then occasionally I've seen Horde steamrolling Westfall as skulls while low levels just look pitifully or apathetically on. Literally zero honor, just griefiing to inconvenience people trying to quest or vendor stuff.
---
seriously. The whole server is trash now. Even the horde, who intended to play on a pvp server, are on a \~90:1 server. Where's the fun in that? They will start complaining and eventually rerolling elsewhere. RIP Flamelash.
---
im not full of shit but he got a ban after i appealed it and he put in a false report
---
I hate that this is so coveted, I had this on all my vanilla toons, even picked it up on my tbc toons.
---
Doesn't help availability of black lotus nodes when you have an asian gold farming guild timing and staking them all out like my server lol
---
One more reason why I play alts and don’t raid, if every drop in mc was equipped and used it takes 4 months to gear a raid... that’s with 0 unused pieces, so realistically to gear a 40 man raid without split runs your looking at like 6 months + and if your rolling for gear with no bad luck protection that’s how long you can expect it to take.
---
Not all raid gear is good, so that cuts down on the time getting to bis may take, but the amount of loot that drops for 40 people to share is nuts. Especially with 1/2 of it being trash.
---
Now you get funneled gear and without really bad luck you can expect to be pretty much fully geared out in 3 maybe 4 lockouts.
---
As a fellow moo cow I can confirm that this is the case.
---
I don’t *regret* it. I was expecting it to be like vanilla. Intense in major hubs, ganking roamers around less common areas every once in a while and still remote places you could just fuck off to and grind only encountering someone every once in a while.
---
But server populations and therefore density is just too high. The chances of being able to find a half way decent farm spot uncontested is pretty much 0.
---
I tried grinding naga in south azshara by the temple and within 5 mins a gank squad hit me. Thought it was a fluke, but nope, about 12 mins later they were back. It was in their circuit - the fucking empty end of Azeroth where I wouldn’t see someone all day in vanilla.
---
good point but im not sharing the email anyways he recieved his own ban for false report
---
i wanna use 'em all. like pokeman!
---
It takes a long time to gear up. Doesn't matter if you get your MC loot in 3 weeks or in 11 weeks. Because you're still going to be doing MC in 50 weeks.   
---
But /roll is stupid.
---
Bruh imagine the queue times for Horde on Flamelash
---
Might have to grind out mobs for a level. Shimmering flats will get you a level or two if you stick around and grind. Once u get to like 32ish I head over to desolace and do some stuff there. Grind some more mobs and do any quests available in arathi highlands that are your level. Dustwallow should have a few lvl 30-35ish quests aswell. Once u hit 35 you can head to STV. I'd knock out quests in STV if you can stomach the ganking. That will easily get you to 38.
---
Once u hit 38 you can ride SM and RFD all the way to 43-45. Once u get to 42+ you can tackle tanaris, feralas and hinterlands in that order. Come back to tanaris when your high 40s to knock out those higher level quests. 
---
After those 3 areas are done, head to searing gorge and do all the quests there. I recommend grinding mobs and doing some dungeons. That will get you to atleast 53-54. Then you can live in instances till 60.
---
I forgot to mention that you should definitely run ZF in tanaris at 45. Get your carrot on a stick too. At lvl 50ish run Mara and do the corruption of Earth and seed quest, and also the pariah quest as well. 
---
This is the exact strategy I have used on all my toons. If you hit any quest walls grind out a level or two on good money mobs or dungeons. And good luck!
---
i was told the GM who gave the ban didnt look deep enough into the the logs after the ordeal where he would see where i mailed him the gold anyways it was a false report and now he is enjoying his own ban
---
IIRC that was only added in 3.0.8.
---
If you reroll to any PvP server at this point, you're a fucking idiot.
---
I'd happily pay money to no longer be on one.
---
This isn't really anything to do with the "modern gamer vs the old gamer of 2005" but more to do with the fact that people back then didn't necessarily know what was coming ahead.  We know every phase and what content is coming with it, bar some minor changes, and we also know how much of a grind it is to get to certain pvp ranks.  Because of this knowledge, people act in a certain way to maximize their gains.
---
And on the alliance vs horde thing, this is not new.  Horde are not any more dickish than alliance are.  It's all about faction balance on any given server.  If BlackRock mountain on a server has more horde in it, alliance will get ganked.  And vise versa.  
---
I don't think the no changes crowd can be blamed for anything.  They asked for vanilla in the first place (nostalrius) and we got it because of them.  It's a reasonable thing to request that the experience blizzard was going to replicate in 2019 keep the integrity of original vanilla, because otherwise it wouldn't be a reexperiencing and more of a fresh take which is not really what you want or need when wishing to relive an old classic.
---
Right?  like just because some shitty rewards are offered (that nobody needs to the clear current content btw) they are all forced to be massive dickheads? Yeah. No. They were dickheads all along.
---
I played PVP realm in classic and BC and remembered how bad it was so I made sure to go PVE cause I don’t got time to deal with all that
---
because you chose the wrong race. Nothing beats mechanostriders.
---
You say that like Eve isn't one of the most psycho-attracting games out there. Even outside of PvP the corporations and subterfuge stuff I've heard about... It seems like the natural result of letting players have THAT much control over the game world.
---
&gt;no counterarguments
---
&gt;resorts to insults
---
And you're THAT guy. :)
---
That is more of a problem I admit, but reaching rank 2 is very easily done if you PvP at all.
---
lol the fact you act like this behind a screen is pathetic but either way it was a false report he is now enjoying a ban
---
&gt; You know you can pop berserker rage then swap back to battle stance right
---
you do know a half decent rogue will have an addon that shows youre in berseker rage for 10 seconds, right? also, dumbfuck, they can stun you for the same duration that berserk lasts lmao 
---
&gt;You pop berserker for the gouge
---
see, any half decent rogue controls you
---
they will watch your stance... if you go berserker, they stun.... if you battle, they gouge... you cant use berserker stance from battle and you cant swap stance when stunned, so because they dont require a stance swap, they just react to what yours is
---
&gt;disarm if you want
---
usually by the time you can play your character they already pop evasion because its a mere 5 min CD (or less w/ talents) and lasts a full 15 seconds ... and you cant disarm them when that is up (well, you might get super lucky, but ive never seen it as the chance is very low)
---
&gt;You suck at making your argument not sound stupid
---
I used to play among arena gladiators dude... the challenge is discussing PVP with scrubs online that don't know wtf theyre talking about
---
&gt;going to stop you switching stances if they dont have the cp to cast kidney shot
---
you can cast a full kidney after a cheapshot, so you have no window to do anything before the kidney 
---
&gt;You dont need to be an orc
---
actually being horde gives you a massive advantage
---
a rogue v an orc warrior is like playing russian roulette with the gun loaded 5/6 chambers with a bullet
---
a stun resist will fuck the rogue
---
but as alliance you dont get that massive advantage 
---
&gt;Its insane to think that a warrior as bad as the game as you are, has a hand of rag to show off; PVE have absolutely no idea how to pvp.
---
your making statements that you can confirm are 100% false by simply watching the Classic Duelers League.... warriors are amazing for tanking, and PVE fury dps, but absolute shit in serious PVP in classic. Even the tournaments they hald back in 2006 would avoid using any warriors, and the one team that did for the BGs was last place and the warrior renamed himself "sitsinroots"
---
every argument you just made is factually false and easily avoidable by any half decent rogue
---
you probably just play horde and at a very low skill level so most of this stuff just doesnt make sense to you
---
Wait did Swifty drop off of Faerlina?
---
BGs are cross-realm.
---
Horde “won” the server from you Alliance carebears
---
It does.
---
Weird, those are my exact thoughts. But I had fun levelling with my husband. Lol. I reached 50 at least, so I will definitely have to return one day, just to know that I reached max level at least. Really hoping BG will help with the ganks as well.
---
i did not know of the printing of logs from above TY for the info! but it was a bit of error on the GMs part he didnt dive deep enough into the logs after the situation to see that i mailed him
---
wait really? I thought whoever is 1st standing on server gets 13000 rp guaranteed
---
Thanks for accurate math! I would change the title if I could, I kinda knew the math I did was gonna be at least a LITTLE bit wrong so thanks for telling me the actual chances.
---
I couldn't stomach being an anklebiter :D
---
The Horde zug zug’d triumphantly
---
I gave you an upvote, but Ok let's be honest here , if blizzard said this was working as intended people would lose their shits.
---
i got banned by an actual GM but im now unbanned thanks to my appeal and he is now banned for false report
---
Just can’t let someone be happy with something?
---
What does distract actually do? Only turn a character to face the other way?
---
You didn't ask Jack shit, but you did claim he was deflecting a valid argument. What about the argument is valid?
---
If that's what his post said before the edit then my bad, but from what I can/could tell it was just someone saying they started fresh on a new server, and deflecting the posts that they should feel obligated to pick a specific faction. The only bravado I saw was that people who complain about server imbalance are weak, while that's a little spicy I can't really say I disagree it's getting tiring especially when brought into a discussion where it is not relevant at all..
---
No you don't have to defend anything, but I'm certainly welcome to challenge it. 
---
Admittedly the part about quitting a server I did think you were the other person. Just seemed like an equivilant argument to 'do something you don't want to do because it will help'. But you didn't post that so I'm sorry for directing it at you.
---
I looked into the Email afterwards and found it was about be using Derrogative terms towards him but it was false and i appealed it
---
Okay Jeremy.
---
You will care when you want to do AQ and those doors remain shut for weeks.
---
The best part is the random orc in the picture
---
consider the last few weeks as a learning experience and look for a dkp/epgp guild asap, loot council might be an option if you can join a really good guild but joining this late don't expect to be treated like a king either. join a guild that distibutes gear with a system and suck it up, you'll be geared much sooner than in a guild that has pugs and rolls gear.
---
I like how there’s a dead dwarf just lying there
---
Pussies
---
Yeah when I was farming for HoJ, I think I saw Banthok sash 9-10 times out of my 37 runs. I think on 2 runs, the ogre spawned but dropped the ring instead
---
That rogue in the picture is perfect for this picture. It shows an asshole preying on the last few people left, in the middle of IF. I hope he enjoys the server he created. LOL.
---
*why are the horde so fucking stu-*
---
Because people didn't know what the fuck they were doing. People picked what they thought would be fun, not what was simming the best or based on which racial gave a slight advantage in pvp. 
---
Sadly, 2019 mmo gamers and 2004 mmo gamers are a completely different breed of player.
---
Reddit probably the biggest concentration morons on the internet.
---
World pvp is heaps and bounds better than getting farmed by premades in bgs.
---
Good god man that is fucking bleak.
---
They did optimize it for minimum cost. Just like these minecraft FTB servers where you can't put down stuff like Quarries because they load chunks.
---
Will keep that in mind! I'm still not at a high enough skill level to craft a repair bot, but once I am, I will probably consider doing that as well. Regarding the hp pots and bandages, how many would you recommend me to take with me?
---
I prefer rolls to DKP. With rolls, you always have a 1/# of same class (or role IE Melee DPS, Caster DPS) chance of getting something every raid.
---
With DKP...you will have a chance eventually but if you join someone whose been running for a while you'll get scraps until others begin to exhaust DKP. Or you get one item, move to the bottom and have no chance until you earn more DKP. Also, people are hoarding DKP in my guild for the ultra-rare drops.
---
PLUS ULTRA
---
You actually don't because the smooth brains at  Blizz are gonna auto-open the gates after a month
---
That's how I feel sometimes especially at peak time. It's like I'm a black lotus spawn that everyone wants a piece of.
---
Yeah that’s a fair opinion and actually I agree with you in the general idea. Just out of curiosity, which faction do you play and what is the ratio on your server?
---
In another post I saw, all the alliance left the server. So there aren’t any there to join the chat.
---
All BGs do is alter the reward structure. The reward structure of p2 so far is super broken
---
Best place to mob grind as a 45 warlock? Looking for suggestions!
---
Stop shitting from your mouth for fks sake.  Honor brackets in Vanilla are relative. So you have to get people to actually get 15HK on that imbalanced server. Also there is a minimum amount of people you need to reach a certain bracket. If you don‘t have enough people ranking you wont have enough ranks. Also you have to be the first of all these people. This has a lower possibility than all the planets alligning so gl with that.
---
Maybe have your mom read it to you
---
*laughs in Earthfury
---
Well I see like 30 raid drops per week. I haven't seen a single black lotus yet.
---
Cannibalize is much more fun than /dance ;-)
---
You ever been to a party that got ruined because someone drank too much? Sure we like to drink, thats why we went to the party, but when someone starts shit and people leave, no one says “stop whining about someone getting drunk at a party, you shouldnt have gone in the first place then.”
---
theres pvp, then theres spending 5 minutes just to drown someone at the bottom of a lake, like our good friend u/geoseph_ of blaumeux.
---
 More of the former is okay, but some people need to seriously chill the fuck out.
---
Normal servers are fine.
---
Minority faction players on ganking servers will migrate, either to their side's majority servers, or to normal servers.
---
Most likely not, it has a lot better server distribution right now than Flamelash had coming into phase 2.
---
I hate the noise.
---
Damn, I guess he'll be no-lifing it if he wants to hit rank 14.
---
Delete gnomes from the game and I'll reroll alliance. Until then, not a chance.
---
Actually you constantly get ganked in the city because you have to be in an Alliance zone AND ALIVE for 5 minutes before you get non-PVP flagged. So horde camp the mage port-in spot and the flightmaster and can kill everyone. It's very hard to stay alive for 5 minutes in ironforge to get the pvp flag removed.
---
You are only going to fix the issues on ganking servers if you get a whole lot of players with an attitude that everyone having fun is important.
---
And those players aren't going to roll on ganking servers.
---
Nope.  People own OLEDs.  It's fine.  Not changing it, so I don't what you want.
---
I made plenty of counter arguments, I laid out my entire perspective and what makes it unfun. You ignore those and lost your asshole dismissive comments.
---
I don’t need to make them again.
---
I'm pretty sure the big 3 cooldowns for warriors share cooldowns so no recklessness + shield wall.
---
No one has seen hollow man. Duh
---
Kinda hate that
---
Winners?
---
FREE HONOR
---
For the Bored!
---
I saw this for the first time the other day as well!
---
May I suggest if you wanted to have fun on a ganking server, you shouldn't have rolled late ?
---
but. the experience?
---
In either case it’s still lower base damage and faster.
---
Full stack of bandages at least and a few stacks for pots. More if you have em, the more you have the more liberally you are likely to use them which only helps the healers
---
Just curious, what do you find cool about paladin?  I always thought of them as gimmicky buff bots that weren't very good at 2 of their 3 roles, but I'd like to hear from someone who likes them to change my mind.  I loved blood elf paladin in BC because of seal of blood and paladins actually were decent at tanking, but classic paladin always seemed sour in my opinion.
---
Pretty much this.  
---
I recently started leveling on Flamelash after I heard my friends had rolled on there, my level 38 shaman didn't do any camping and was more subjected to being camped.  
---
Once I heard the news I managed to convince my friends to hop to a different server.
---
Charges like this are surprisingly repeatable. I know in UBRS, in one of the very first Orc packs in the room on the right, everytime I charge in I do a weird route. Everytime.
---
This is when you sell yourself out as an ally player and make bank
---
Depending on the guilds it will be 1k people. We have about 50 people for our one raiding team. Usually we have 43 people who want to come to the raid, so yeah, you need more than just 40 people. Then there are guilds with several raiding teams. Some guilds on my server have 3 raiding teams.

Old screenshot from Warsong Glutch in vanilla, I took this screenshot as that flag carrier jump to the bug spot.
---
It was one of the tactics to ruin the premade gaming experience though.
---
I think the draw distance should be even further than that.
---
What did you spend your gold on?
---
I bought my mount at 41 on my first character and had 90g again by 48 or so from just normal gameplay. It ramps up very quickly in your 40s.

---
Haha, love it! 😂😂
---
Bad analogy
---
No. Honestly the fact that vanilla private servers were a thing and not only a thing but a consistent one, through the years, for a decade, proves that he is wrong.  
---
The only reason we are seeing such things play out with server imbalances and wpvp is all due to Blizzard's actions. Blizzard *chose* to do megaservers, Blizzard *chose* to release bgs at a separate time from honor, Blizzard *chose* to still not give us a keyring.  
---
Its all due to them. You cant make these odd decisions, which almost feel like actively sabotaging the game, then claim to be correct.
---
Or they just don't have english as their mother language
---
&gt; pretending to be new
---
You can choose to not believe me, that's fine, but this is legitimately the first time I've played WoW.
---
I don't care enough about Reddit Karma to make up bullshit
---
I'm alliance too...dungeon leveling is the only way to play currently. I was 48 when phase 2 hit, and leveling has slowed down tremendously. I'm 53 currently and just login to get a few honor kills every day if I can.
---
Any time I step foot in tanaris I get corpse farmed. I gave up on my main and started a couple of alts. Hoping BGs will help
---
Dude no one but kids on their parents account *looked up to you* for having epics.
---
I’d get messages about how cool my tier 1 looked, asking if we were recruiting, etc... but not admiration for raiding...
---
This ^^
---
OLED TV =/= OLED Monitor
---
Willful ignorance.
---
Don't even try to reason with this type of subhuman.
---
Faction imbalances always suck for both sides. I'm on Shazzrah. I can't do any fun PvP, because the server is just too imbalanced for it. So my choices are:
---
1. Don't do PvP
---
2. Take part in the slaughtering of Alliance
---
Currently I'm choosing number 1.
---
congrats, getting your first mount is a great feeling
---
It's fucking pathetic how many things private servers got better. Melee leeway, action queueing, and draw distance are all things that were NOT a problem in 2005+. I played the game on a dual core laptop with great frames and my real ping to my server was freaking THIRTEEN (13). When I pressed a button, it happened with no perceptible lag. This same experience was had on private servers. Why then would they go and make the game feel intentionally awful with an interior experience!? Was every WoW player a third worlder with carrier pigeon internet? Fucking ridiculous.
---
This is a pretty vague statement. What problems are you talking about, and what solutions are players refusing to accept?
---
Reckon it took time to build up the rep for the dog
---
Sorry rules don't apply to Blizzard Dev's faction. 
---
shoulda thunk about that when you rolled pve, moron /s
---
This list is not correct. Have har curse of reck being pushed off aswell as winters chill
---
I guess he actually wanted to play on a pve server the whole time.
---
not even close, can't really remember what it was, but there was a vid where a warrior basically charged though an entire dungeon
---
Pagle is full.
---
I could tho
---
Forgot they had added battle groups by 1.12 my bad
---
&gt;not sure if it's 100% accurate for Classic
---
learn to read
---
The key ring hits the hardest.
---
Battlegrounds are out in 5 days anyway and things will calm down.
---
Not gangster. More like a vermin infestation not worth dealing with.
---
What was your character name if you don't mind me asking? I met a guildie randomly on another games' subreddit a few years ago lol, it was wild.
---
Windseeker Alliance here. Feels even. Seems like we may have a couple more. But the horde on windseeker respond well at Southshore. Freaking kief chief the rogue always ganking my fury-leather-wearing ass at half health.
---
i wanted classic just to play rogue
---
Omg this. People jumped on the dead server bandwagon hard. They refused to listen to those of us who tried to tell them otherwise.
---
As an altoholic who has yet to level my lock too much, this was my takeaway.  Lower ranks are a big part of what I looked forward to in Classic
---
they only did it if it was outcry from some people, on "smaller" servers like this, they just dont give a fuck
---
Another plus to this is if you get into a decent guild at this point, you might pick up some pieces nobody needs easily in the first couple weeks.  We just had two brand new people join and get gear their first raid.
---
I'm going to toot my guilds own horn by saying we did MC in 43 minutes this week. We were trying to speed run and see if we could beat our 50 min time. Yay us!
---
 Fyi not saying 1.5hrs is bad by any means. That's actually good in comparison to most guilds on my realm. I just wanted to say something cuz I'm happy we did good.
---
I just yell out what I’m willing to pay and then a mage invites me. 
---
“WTB 5 stacks of 55 for 1.5g”
---
And then someone insta invites me and the price is already pre set.
---
Is this what will happen to heartseeker? Lol
---
Can confirm over on Arugal subreddit we have sweaty nerds playing 12 hours a day harassing people for being even sweatier and playing for 15 hours a day. It's great.
---
The 15 hour guy even claims he doesn't care about rank, just likes to pvp and the colluding guilds hate him :)
---
Executioner’s cleaver is better for PVE and around 10-25G depending.
---
i mean, they kind of did
---
you think you do, but you don't
---
and it proves that he was more right than a lot of people thought when they announced classic.
---
the game design of vanilla rewards the worst of people, and well, this is the result.
---
No he’s not. The server’s weren’t this populated in vanilla. Also, they kinda screwed us when they only released 10 servers to start. They keep saying they listen to our feedback but keep saying they are blown away by the response for classic. Those 2 sentences don’t go together because we have been telling them since they released the initial server list it was a mistake.
---
I thought in vanilla you could go pop to pve, just not pve to pvp
---
One sad group of alliance down,  a few more to go.
---
In orcish, c ƒ ◃ c c € ™  -&gt;  o k z o o m r
---
Yeah once BWL and AQ are out there's not much use for R14 gear. The competition will reflect that too, it did back in the day. When the Honor System first came out every remotely serious player on the server wanted rank, but it was mainly the gear they were after and not the title or achievement of it. After Ashkandi and Obsidian Edged Blades started raining down, tons of people just stopped giving much of a shit about hitting ranks anymore.
---
And that was Vanilla...Classic is seeing way more people smoking the raids than Vanilla ever came close to.
---
Faster is good if the damage is basically the same. More vengeance uptime and higher white dps. The frost part also ignores armour.
---
slow = good and not tinking beyond that is a sing of a bad ret.
---
Some capped factions to keep balance in check.
---
Not everyone played on Pservers and to be pedantic, none were fully blizzlike and had some differences. So this is absolutely unique.
---
That's exactly what's happening. Idk why they did this, at first I thought "oh it's spell batching, makes sense" but it's not just spells, it's everything. Even just buying items from npcs takes 2 fucking seconds. I'm sure it's purposeful, but I don't know why they did this. Maybe it saves them money and they can justify it because "classic lol" ?
---
They turned a PvP server into a PvE one for themselves. “Winning”.
---
Addon cepgp
---
So the enemy is just gonna follow that flagged person for 30 seconds in the city so they can kill them and not be raped by guards and other players? 
---
Its gonna be one offs if this happens, BG's give rep rewards and imo are going to be the preferred method to farm honor.
---
Nobody realizing the importance of the fucking orc rogue trying desperately to farm honor in fucking iron forge???? This is skeram-us right now. There hasn't been a mass Exodus But there easily could be. The balance is basically the same
---
Instead of fighting the horde. That’s why they get owned.
---
Rattlegore has some really serious PvP-ers on alliance side (hey &lt;Nostalgia&gt;!) so while its imbalanced enough that getting to BRM solo is really painful, I can always hop in a PvP squad and roll some lazy campers later, which makes the whole thing a lot more tolerable.
---
Also seeing “Corpse of Feetpics” lying around every time I’m in IF warms my lil dwarf heart.
---
Fire Prot potions last for an hour, so you can pop them well before the fight.
---
It actually auto completes eventually so they will get into AQ just slower than other servers.
---
Every server had a queue at launch so that's clearly not the case.
---
You're assuming that the Reddit echo chamber represents the entire Classic population, but that couldn't be further from the truth.
---
We get it, you killed your neighbors cats as a kid weirdo.
---
You can’t hit 14 unless you have ~300 people on the server with 15+ HKs every week.
---
ya'll Alliance are weird
---
Dude it puts character names in an internal list and reparses it when scanning -- no one is ever counted twice.
---
It's as accurate as before, just slower.
---
Lol ur dumb
---
I could be wrong but I remember getting honor, didn't happen to me very often though since I ran premades all the time.
---
Not even close. Some guilds don’t even log raids.
---
People with multiple accounts can also just make ally toons and funnel mats to them through the neutral AH for pennies.
---
Flamelash horde will be fine
---
lol.
---
&gt; If you were one of the initial players in vanilla, has classic wow been almost exactly how you remembered it?
---
Not really, but it's close enough to a vestige of the past that I'm happy I'm able to experience it when I wasn't really able to in the same way back then. Being a clueless noob definitely "tainted" or rather colored my initial experiences in a certain way. Certain things seemed harder or more imposing than I actually found them to be, but then again I've been playing games and MMOs (and looking up information) for years going onto two decades at this point.
---
&gt; Has your view on the game changed since you've gotten older? 
---
A fair bit yeah. In a lot of ways. Kind of hard to think even where to start. WoW was for a long time something anomalously popular, bigger than just about any game I ever particularly liked in the past. I played a small amount in vanilla (might have been actual 1.12 or 1.11 or something) but never got hooked into it for various reasons. Some friends played but I never did after giving it a small attempt.
---
When I first caught wind of Classic being a thing was right around the time I was hearing about private servers being shut down. I actually NEVER played a private server but I was curious about the game on and off, but even later in life I felt like "retail" wasn't for me. Despite not actually experiencing it yet, I do suspect that Vanilla - TBC or WotLK would also be "peak WoW" for me, or otherwise I would have gotten off the train at some point. I suspect I might have quite enjoyed Legion but it didn't pan out, and BfA does not seem to be the thing for me.
---
The whole lead up to Classic kind of made me nostalgic for a game I barely played, or perhaps more accurately, I had a longing for a popular thing that kind of passed me by, and I had interest in trying to live a bygone era. While I still play games, I really do feel a lot of modern gaming (especially with lootboxes) has gone a path that I don't care to engage with at all, even if it means not even dealing with it begrudgingly. Classic gave me a small hope that maybe I'd get to try some old design again, same as some other old games I still enjoy today.
---
As Classic was closer to launch, I became nervous that I wouldn't actually enjoy it despite building it up a bit for myself. I feared it'd feel too archaic, and that a lack of nostalgia goggles like other people since I never played it much would means I'd see much more cons than pros. Fortunately, it turns out my fears were wrong. I'm not sure if it's what I "expected" but I'm still having tons of fun overall, at least for now. I don't know how long I might stick it out, but if it's still fun I'll stick it out for however long.
---
&gt; Are you playing it more or less than you expected...
---
More, though fortunately I don't feel that "obligated" to. I really try to do what's fun for the most part and fortunately I enjoy a lot of the game. The more grindy aspects I avoid or only do what I feel is necessary, like a few things oriented towards raids. But I'd say probably 70 - 90% of my playtime is close to exclusively things I enjoy.
---
&gt; Have the few changes in classic wow (server population...
---
The population is insane. I play on an unqueued server but it regularly hits "Full" anyways. There are pros and cons to a big server, so I can't say if I'd prefer it elsewhere. Just might be a grass is always greener situation. As for anything outside of population I'm not familiar with the base game or private servers enough to make any kind of comparison.
---
Played nonstop. For a few days. Then got burnt out. Can’t bring myself to login again. Guess wow just isn’t my thing anymore.
---
Does this happen with gear progression? Or are those BC numbers
---
Bold and proud!!!
---
I did read. But added that comment for ppl comming here looking for a list. Confirming that its indeed only for private server and the classic list is diffrent.
---
No need to be a toxic basement dweller becuase someone confirms what you say.
---
Not even close.
---
I mean I was blasting Fortunate Son at the time, so maybe I deserved to experience hell?
---
How is it dumb? It’s dumb to have every server outnumber people. If you don’t want to outnumber everyone 5 to 1 go to another server.
---
Thank you for the tips this is really helpful!  I’m downloading healcomms as soon as I get on tomorrow... doh. Can’t believe I was going without it.
---
Yeah no that aint' gon happen.
---
Its absolutely true. The gates do not open until someone bangs the gong after completing the scepter quest chain and the gong doesn't become available until a week after both factions complete the war effort. The server is functionally a dead end now
---
&gt; Even just buying items from npcs takes 2 fucking seconds
---
YES ironically enough this is the absolute worst because if you buy stuff and walk away before their stupid intentional lag happens, you are too far from the vendor when it sends the "buy" packets to the server and you get an error about being too far away. What a freaking mess. I guarantee you're right about it being "we're saving money AND can give the excuse that 'you thought you did but you didn't see this is how bad it really was right guys!'"
---
Idk, shammy to pally? Nbd, switch the set pieces 1 to 1. Pally to shammy... Eh someone would have to go through and make a roughly equivalent list for plate gear to mail. In my opinion tough titties. You want to play on a not dead server? Here's a minor inconvenience.
---
Nobody here but us trees.
---
Are you daft? They had 12 million subscribers in 2010 and 1.7m last year.
---
It’s just cuz there is a lot of people doing it. 
---
Wpvp will be more fun when everything balances. 
---
For the record though 10v10s are really fun.
---
Also, is there a reasonable expectation for 1v1s open world?
---
If that’s what you want there’s this thing called dueling.
---
No titles in game other than pvp titles
---
They weren’t right. Servers are turning into “ghost towns” because people think if its not a mega server its dead. Also the wpvp stuff is causing a lot of people to quit temporarily. Again, these issues are caused by mega servers because there weren’t many to begin with.
---
So there is a possible part II of the diary for all the way to TBC? 🤩
---
Honestly,  I think the boat battles would be a great bg, close quarters, lots of los, and fast respawns. Yeah it sucks when leveling but it would be a lot worse without the respawn when you zone
---
55" is not a monitor, that's a TV without a tuner.  For consumer products, OLED panels are available in very large (55"+) sizes, or very small (high end phones, laptop screens).
---
Next he’ll try to take a bunch of elixirs to make the shortest and tiniest character.
---
Damn! I have always gotten the explorer titles on my retail alts. Well I guess I’ll stop exploring then!
---
Hard to spread out to other servers when Blizzard locks your choice of server transfer to 1 or 2 servers.
---
This. You only get pvp titles and I think there will be scarab lord this time.
---
You can do it for your own feat
---
There is literally a dead guy in my group who was killed while swimming on the surface. I was also killed just before I could jump into the water a minute earlier. Outside of places like BRM, there can still be significant Alliance presence.
---
Vanilla capped at 3-4K concurrent. It could have many more chars. Krom would need 30-40k players online to be 10x the size. Most likely they are 2-3x. The problem is vanilla pvp was only cancer during peak times while in classic it’s sunday-Saturday 11am-11pm.
---
Same thing. Been checking him since early September, various times of the day morning, afternoon, night. Haven’t seen him once.
---
Great write-up!
---
Yeh, it took a bit of effort and time for a guild to spin up a new recruit. Some just skipped it and poached, which wrecked their former guilds. Which is one of the main reasons AQ and especially Naxx were regarded as guild killers. The poaching was insane and frustrating.
---
Yay it isn't rare, like 20 minute restock, just not available to horde naturally. The alliance also have a really awesome food recipe vendor. It stocks all the quest recipes and is the easy way to get the alliance foods to horde. Horde has a similar vendor but if I remember correctly, it is missing things so can't do it the other way around as easily
---
And there we have it folks, the least interesting thing you'll see on Reddit all day.
---
The effective number of 60ies that engage in the world seem much higher in Classic. The casual crowd didn't come back to Classic, it's a world of enthusiasts.  
---
If Vanilla was a flea market where you cold find master-pieces, then Classic is "Fleamarket-Master Enthusiast Convention" where everyone is a dedicated to optimizing their deals.
---
I really wish it didn't suck. :(
---
Skilled hunters in BM spec with some solid micro managing can for sure main tank 5mans while leveling. My owl main tanked countless LBRS and BRD runs the first few weeks in mid fifties to early 60s (That was during the no-bis to half-prebis era though, so obviously player threat gen potential was much lower)
---
With good managing of targeting both by your group and your pet it’s very feasible. 
---
Send pet in, have everyone single target down first mob while pet/group stuns it, micro your pet with enrage on multiple targets but mostly whoever’s next on the list, so on and so forth.
---
Is it easy? No. Possible? Yea totally was. But nowadays it’s a tall ask as most people at 60 have access to at least some raid gear.
---
Play on a PvE server, having an absolute blast and my motivation hasn't died at all.
---
Raiding every week, leveling alts, doing PvP in Hillsbrad. Having a hell of a good time.
---
Krampfen, I want you to remember that:
---
We know from chaos theory that even if you had a perfect model of the world, you’d need infinite precision in order to predict future events. With socio-political or economic phenomena, we don’t have anything like that.

Nope, unless its a BG weekend you get nothing in WSG for going 0-3. 
---
If the system is dominated by premades, then pugs really are better of just staying out of WSG.

https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System
---
Just because people complain doesn't mean it should be changed, the #nochanges still stands. Once we're beyond Naxx then and only then should any "changes" be made if they were going Classic+ and not TBC, etc.

Don't need enemies for the honor system. 1 player will do.
---
im going to find a lowbie and camp them now because of this comment :))))))))))
---
Agreed but I still think the issue still be here today even if they released with way more servers, I don’t wanna streamer blame but faelina for eg is as big as because of asmon punk, and tips to name a few and people all kinda gathered together between 3-4 servers at the start of release
---
Imagine blaming someone else for your enjoyment (or lack there of) in the game. I assume this is a bait post, but it stems from some people’s actual concern with the game.
---
Everyone plays games differently. Whether or not they play it “your” way is irrelevant. This game came out 15 years ago. Unfortunately, that means wonder of figuring things out is gone. You can hide from it, but not everyone is going to do the same. You adapt or you find friends that share your mindset.
---
The irony here is piercing.  OP says #nochanges “morons” are to blame, while #nochanges is in fact the SOlution.  Server capacity, for instance.
---
Had fun leveling a warlock and playing that.  
---
Friends decided to roll on Flamelash instead so I started leveling a shaman and I am enjoying that.  
---
Flamelash literally died so we all transferred to Earthshaker and I am currently at 39 on my shaman.  
---
It's been a wild ride but I love the game.
---
The Imbalance is obvious in IF, where if an alliance member walks beyond the Bank/AH flagged they are killed
---
Its not a balance thing, its an interest thing.  Horde naturally make friends better than alliance.
---
What happened to that server?
---
Bloodsail has like nothing than.
---
I'm having trouble finding the link leading to proof in your post.
---
Theres no alliance dominated servers in EU?
---
I did mara/ZF till 53. It's still good exp till then, esp if you do GY. Now i'm just waiting for the weekend when I have time for a full ST run (I have like 6 ST quests in my log). But yeah, I've been at 53 since the weekend.
---
The orc rogue makes this post
---
ohh my, that is a problem then.
---
And then they announced server transfers away from multiple-hour queue times, solving your problems, and you stayed on the megaserver.
---
At that point, was it you, or was it Blizzard ?
---
Because it was a hoax, they don't actually give DKs
---
Maybe they thought alliance would organize and fight back?
---
lol
---
The game isn't for casuals. Go back to retail, or better yet go back to Farmville
---
Whereeee I’ve beeeeen
---
You're popping off like it doesn't exist after your own mention of it.  So I asked if you forgot about it.  
---
Even one purchase of one OLED monitor would make my reference valid.  22", 55", 6" it don't matter.  It's OK to mention OLED monitors in examples.  Despite all that, it's got nothing to do with the point in my comment where I referenced it. 
---
Even when I worked in IT, I never encountered someone so fixated on OLED monitors.  This is some real neckbeard shit.  Do you get up in arms about mouse pads too?  
---
I'm not changing comment for you.  I don't know what you want from me.
---
   You are speaking from your own *opinion* of the TOS. Tokens have monetary value... *TO BLIZZARD*, assuming someone is buying them. Now there are lots of things in game that have "monetary value" that are traded for outside of the game and yes in those instances that is against the rules. This is a trade that is in game items for in game items and all traded in game. The only one making any monetary gain in this case, is blizzard.
---
you do
---
He asked for accurate. So the answer is nowhere will he find that info
---
It's not? It'd be pretty great without the no-lifers.
---
Scarab Lord was only a title in TBC.
---
Had you considered using a fastener?  
---
Nowadays it's easy and affordable to obtain screws. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw)
---
Lmfao good job to all the goons who’re too scared to actually wpvp. Bravo.
---
**Screw**
---
A screw is a type of fastener, in some ways similar to a bolt (see Differentiation between bolt and screw below), typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a male thread (external thread). Screws are used to fasten materials by digging in and wedging into a material when turned, while the thread cuts grooves in the fastened material that may help pull fastened materials together and  prevent pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; those commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.

Why would I order a 80 dollar steak when my mom makes me hot pockets and delivers them to me while I gank you all day?  I don’t care that I get no honor; I just want to see you try to mask your actual rage with a sarcastic reddit post regarding your insecurities about the current state of classic.  Did you know they have steak hot pockets?
---
it's not even about being casual.
---
these whiny bitches have one or two bad experiences during prime time getting camped and automatically shift the blame to someone/something other than themselves.

Thx dude, that is exactly the kind of answer I was looking for. =)

Yeah I even hated the gnome Halloween costumes. I would legit get rid of that costume is someone put it on me haha.
---
Those guys give me a giggle. To be fair one night at the release of P2 we were hitting up IF for some honor and the Alliance started to form some pretty solid groups and kick us out to the lake. Then all of a sudden the Los Pepe's stroll into the zone w like 20 guys
---
If you are completely alone in teh honor system, the highest you can reach is like rank 2 lol.  The system needs about \~150 players in the pool to allow a rank 14 I believe
---
Camping the same person, even in excess is not griefing. Can even find blue posts saying it isn't. Only very specific targeted harassment can be counted as griefing but even then very rarely. Even seen them say that using another account is not griefing.
---
I was on Illidan as well and being one of the few horde dominated servers really drove home how I had zero desire to be on PvP. 
---
Glad I went pve this round.
---
He was already wrong as fuck. The game has been insanely popular it's literally just phase 2 and removal of layering and resulting server overpopulation causing problems for a few weeks. Things will improve in 5 days.
---
Eh but “no changes” would have actually alleviated a lot of these problems because servers would have sensible population levels. Changes are the root of the problem.
---
What if playing what makes you happy is actually being able to play the game?
---
I've had quite a few lucky drops. 2 random epic boe epic drops. Almost an epic mount. A ton of enchanting mats.
---
I don't want to do that again. I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere. I'm not happy about it. But better than the pvp server.
---
It won't happen like that. The existence of sappers deters any type of plan like that. They will have to spread out and stop Alliance from entering the old fashioned way. Otherwise, they'll just be a juicy honor farm for the organized guilds.
---
If they allowed a faction swap with incentive I would do it

How did anyone else kill it for you, if you are just sitting back and going taking your time?
---
I ran from a group on my lock, unending breath and dive dive dive, they gave up quickly. Then I just farmed beside the shore underwater
---
They won't be able to open AQ though, they'll have to wait for it to auto unlock.
---
There isn’t much a Druid can do against a warlock anyway, you just made it quicker for him
---
Now that's kinda in contradiction with him though? If you want to get rank 14 you need to get all the honor you can get and do it for as long every day as you can.
---
Faction imbalance is the main culprit and Blizzard is entirely to blame for that.
---
Only need one person in town to queue the entire group if I recall. Could easily see someone paying to queue people up for BGS.
---
The numbers say otherwise.
---
Orbitas lacuna
---
Yes. There is a difference between doing a 20 minute daily workout routine versus 16 hours a day olympic training. One is suggested the other is not.
---
&gt;If you were one of the initial players in vanilla, has classic wow been almost exactly how you remembered it?
---
The zones and questing, absolutely. But the sheer knowledge of things does change it quite a bit. That said, it feels...proper...I've played since Vanilla and it has been a very long time since WoW felt like WoW for me.
---
&gt;Has your view on the game changed since you've gotten older?
---
Not really. I was already in my 20's when WoW launched and don't have kids. So my amount of free time and whatnot is about the same TBH.
---
&gt;Are you playing it more or less than you expected + are you playing it nearly as much as you did when classic released?
---
Way more. I wasn't all that excited about Classic at all up until the last stress test and then it clicked. I am currently in a large-ish guild, clearing MC every week, etc. Way more into it than I ever thought I would. 
---
&gt;Have the few changes in classic wow (server population changes/1.12 balance/mob respawn times) been very noticeable?
---
I have vague memory of Vanilla with regard to talents and whatnot. So the 1.12 balance doesn't really seem different to me. The server I am on is about equal to a Full server in Vanilla, so doesn't feel overcrowded. It is busier than I remember Vanilla being, but not by a gigantic amount. 
---
For those keeping score; I play on Bloodsail Buccaneers (RP-PvE) which I think contributes a lot to my opinions on Classic. Basically just a chill PvE server. I've had one single queue (launch day), and Phase 2 didn't have much impact other than I can go do wPvP if I want. In vanilla I went PvE &gt; PvP &gt; RP so knew that I'd be happiest with RP-PvE in Classic. So far, it has been great. No real complaints.
---
A lot of pugs do one lot till everyone gets something,  it's a little better but you can still get nothing in a run
---
And we pray that you do not alter it any further.
---
I addressed that exact point already.
---
You're never going to persuade anyone if you can't even understand their argument.
---
They're both pretty rough as alliance but from what I have seen, I think Skeram's imbalance is a bit worse. I am Ally on Herod and it takes 30-40 minutes to corpse run to BRD with how many horde there are. Herod is probably the better option of the two but if you are adamant on going pvp you are probably going to be outnumbered regardless unless you go heartseeker.
---
It depends where you go really. Some areas tend to have groups and others you can catch people riding solo. You get more honor killing 1v1 so usually those areas are better.
---
If you only compete versus 49 others in the honor system, then rank 12 is about the highest the system allows, even at standing 1.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?minLevel=60&amp;realm=4728_Benediction
---
Come to benediction as alliance - we’re very close to being a balanced server but will slip if tends continue. We need new blood to maintain the balance.
---
Hit up Banksyalt with in game mail and I’ll toss you some spare bags to help out a new start (whatever my wife can make on her lower level lock - going broke buyin ah bags for people, singlehandedly blew up the price of mageweave bags by 30-40%).
---
"Carebears" says the guy who selected the faction with the EZMode racials, and favorable population imbalance. 
---
Ready to take those training wheels off, champ?
---
Its been shit. First the servers where so overloaded I couldnt hardly log on to play. I then had the misfortune of taking a free transfer to Heartseeker as Horde. I litterly cant level and have quit.
---
No, you are wrong.
---
Ppm is literally a mechanic in later expansions and changes how procs work. Classic uses PPH instead. Fucking take your downvotes back and learn before you post
---
Where did I say only horde corpse camp? lol
---
But it’s not like alliance can corpse camp their own faction on their own boats...which is what the thread was about.
---
Yes, you spawn on the boat after the loading screen, and everyone knows this. So when the boat is getting camped, folks who don’t release their spirit get killed as soon as they auto spawn.
---
Tragedy of the Commons.
---
I haven't played WoW since 2012. I've played almost every day since classic launched though. Is the game perfect? Nope. Do I still want to log in and play all the time? Yup!
---
btw if you want to roll Horde on Herod, I will hook you up with some bags and level an alt with you!
---
It would be like that until you no longer have PUGS. When you have consistent members, everyone will steadily get gear even if you still do MS&gt;OS.
---
However, if you want to be rewarded for effort, better to join a DKP or LC guild.
---
Hahaha!  Holy shit!  /u/Riadon2 deleted his account.
---
Good riddance.  I'm not changing my comment for him.  Some people have OLED monitors, some people don't.  Guessing he doesn't.
---
Yeah alliance is too busy crying about the horde instead of going out fighting them.
---
Wow you are so observant, do you just go from post to post and share your informative opinions?  I wish I could be as smart as you.
---
Spent first few weeks at login screen. Then pinged between different classes up to 20 on different factions on different servers until October.  Settled on hunter on a server I was happy with that regularly had full load.  Heavily time invested now with Rhok done, epic mount bought, raid geared, alchemy with pots for next 3 phases stocked in bank.  Now my server’s showing medium a lot of the time.  Population becoming dead and desire to play dropping.
---
This is your brain on Oklahoma
---
I like your attitude.
---
lol everyone in chat
---
You spelled nightsaber wrong.
---
Right percentages.
---
at 50 players * 0.002 you get 0.1, which is rounded to 0 people top brackets that earn 13000 RP required for rank 14
---
at 300 players * 0.002 you get 0.6, which is rounded to 1 in top bracket that earns 13000 RP required for rank 14
---
So at 50 players, bracket 12 (11000 RP) is gonna get one person (50*0.02 = 1) if he keeps top standing. He will eventually reach rank 12 with 11000 RP and then cannot progress because he loses more from decay than he gains from RP.
---
&gt; I am not a furry

---
Lots of delusion going on here my dude
---
Post your ui so I can see the difference. I'm open to changes.. I haven't played wow in like 3 or so years and wanted something new. I hate default blizzard ui as well. I saw a streamer with this ui with some changes so I just made it my own way.
---
dERrR Go To rEtAIL
---
Stop using this site it’s highly inaccurate because it depends on player uploads from an already broken add on. Use the ironforge site, which pulls from Warcraft logs and gauges the lv 60 population correctly.
---
Which server? That sounds very familiar
---
Rerolling at 12 was painful.... lol.
---
If you choose to play on EZMode, you don't get to talk about other people "crying."
---
You're the one who was too scared to play without training wheels lul
---
It's neither horde nor alliance who are at fault here.  It's the mentality of gamers in general these days. People will take advantage of others without thinking about those who are affected by their actions. Being lame is the norm now and no one cares about other people, it is not exclusive to wow.
---

[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Gates\_of\_Ahn%27Qiraj](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj)
---
That is not the case, in fact the horde and alliance actually have a different set of materials to gather. I will correct myself on one account though. The wait time after both factions complete is 5 days not a week
---
Retail is far lass casual friendly imo than classic. Being cutting edge on retail is far more demanding. The only thing classic has on retail for time is rank 14.
---
But if the BG ends you get teleported back to the town.
---
You addressed by you rolled on the server.
---
You didn't address why, when your guild was offered the chance to leave as a guild, you stayed.
---
Thats wasn't Blizzard. That was you.
---
You're literally talking about ICD dude lol, I didn't downvote you. PPM just refers to the amount of procs per minute of sustained actions that trigger it. An item with a 1.8 ppm usually has an 11% chance to proc for example.
---
Yup, health sciences researcher here, agreeing with you completely. Data will almost always be biased or have potential confounders in some way, as long as we're aware of that we can figure out how to control for it. That other guy is full of shit.

---
#PsheroTricks
---
Honestly, really sad to see this, and just how toxic the community can be.
---
Sure we can argue from both sides:
---
Players are at fault for being so toxic, and allowing it to have gotten so bad that an entire faction feel this is their only option.
---
Blizzard is at fault for not intervening sooner, and not listening to the outcries of the community before it got to this point. We could argue Blizzard should have enabled horde only queues and horde only transfers to help balance out the online population. 
---
It’s a sad time when a game we waited years for, finally is released and it’s unplayable due to a toxic community. 
---
I understand death squads and ganking happen on both sides, I’m not arguing that. However, no one can argue that horde have it worse than alliance on any pvp realm. The imbalance makes it hard to level, and even once you’re 60, you can’t go out into the world and enjoy the game for any longer than 2-10 mins at a time before being steamrolled by a death squad and camped for your juicy 13 honor. Although that happens from both sides, I believe alliance has it much worse just given they are so outnumbered on pvp realms. 
---
You can go ahead and argue that they should reroll horde, go to retail or roll on a pve server but most people enjoy pvp when it’s a fair fight. Not when they get raped at every fp, 10 times on the way to a dungeon, or camped by skulls trying to level. That completely sucks the fun out of the game for anyone who wants to enjoy the game. What happens, is exactly this; alliance leave, and you’re left with an entirely horde realm. Left to die and rot. 
---
Feels bad. This likely won’t be the only realm to come to this outcome either.
---
There's plenty of dad guilds for people like you out there, just join one of those
---
Lmao. I love when Reddit actually makes me laugh and I’m in the loop
---
Just need to sort out your conditional order and add conditionals for when you're not targeting anything.  This should do the trick:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [mod,harm,nodead] Mind Flay; [harm,nodead] Mind Blast; [mod,help,nodead][mod,@player] Lesser Heal(Rank 4); [help,nodead][@player] Lesser Heal
---
Makes sense though, if people don't play ball everyone has to work harder. 
---
An organised system means the R14 grind is only a 15-18hr daily grind instead of the 20hr one it would otherwise be.
---
Most wow censuses I can find show is 50/50 overall or slightly in alliance favor.
---
No one has mentioned the benign orc who is getting hammered from the guards but is still keeping a respective distance from the tale-teller??
---
I hate PVP servers, but I want to play with my brother who loves PVP. Guess I'm just gonna keep on trucking along.
---
Whenever I end up in a group which sucks ass I just be honest and after the first boss I will very likely say "Sorry, dont want to waste my time with you" and leave.
---
And if you never invite me again in the future thats a nice bonus for me not having to deal with a novice guy again.
---
And we love it.
---
Where do you see 96% stat?
---
You think you want it, but you don't
---
Pretty sure I did this in that area too. Guildie had a similar one happen in lbrs last night
---
I am a gnome mage and I am one of the only peaceful players on my server. I never attack horde players unless they attacked me or I know they are ganking. I even go out of my way to help horde players who are being attacked by mobs on a regular basis. Once, instead of attacking a lower-lvl warrior who was mining a node I wanted, I did /wait and he actually stopped and let me mine (I just wanted a skill-up). 
---
I get mocked by other alliance on my server and even my own guildmates think it's naive and idealistic.
---
I have met precisely one other alliance who says they share my philosophy, and zero horde (I talk to horde in the server discord etc.).
---
They had a top 10 world Ony kill (now it's fallen to 18th) which I think is what that person was referring to.
---
Let’s not ruin the mood though
---
You're under selling yourself! 90-100 minutes is a pretty good time.
---
The 45 minute MC clear thing is just down to tank/raid leader experience and healers using consumables and mana regen cooldowns on trash as though it's a boss fight. We simply have 100% uptime while other guilds might take as long as it takes to kill trash to decide what to pull next then mark it and check that people are ready. Our clears were taking 60-70 minutes a month ago, with our boss kill times not changing a great deal.
---
Most guilds should be able to kill the bosses pretty quickly. As you do! Our shazz kills around the same length last month. 
---
You're right though world buffs play a big part of it. We just see the 15-30 minutes of gathering them as part of the 60-90 minutes it would take without them.

My advice for the try-hards in your guild is to get buffed a day or two before the raid. Some people in our guild get them on Sunday in prep for wednesday. DM:T first, with geared group this takes like 15-30 minutes tops. Then after that convert to raid and start inviting everybody that's online in your guild. They can just run in and get buffs. Have a mage there to port people to org. 
---
Next fly to felwood and hunt for songflowers - macro below for tomtom waypoints. Normally there's at least one up, if there's a lot of your guild trying to get them at the same time try and share coords and pick times, it's something like 25 minutes before that coord will spawn again though with the felwood buffs it's not 100% guaranteed to respawn at 25 min. If you run around a little and can't find one then the best strategy is to go to the coordinates of a flower and then log out, and keep logging in every 5-10 min until it's spawned. I usually log my mage alt to farm gold in between checking. Once you get it, hearth to org.

Last step is to get Ony and WCB. The hardest part of this is knowing when the buff was last popped. Our guild is pretty active so we usually have somebody online to see. But perhaps you can coordinate with other guilds on a realm discord if you don't. Get the discord server admin to make a channel for announcing heads and whenever you see one get popped you post on that channel. With this knowledge it's just a case of waiting 6 hours for onyxia and 3 hours for rend. You might have to stick at alt at thrall while waiting for the rend buff so you can relog whenever you see a level 55+ run towards him - but as melee that 15% haste is 100% worth it. Though your ability to get these reliably kind of depends on how active your realm is. Golemagg still gets queues from time to time at peak hours, so ony heads pop pretty much every day, and rend is usually up within 10 min of it going active.
---
Once you have both the last step is getting to BRM without dying. This is something we try to do the night before. Send some lock alts and a couple of clickers to BRM and start summoning people to a safe space to log out. Then on raid day, scout with alts to make sure it's safe to log on, and then run in to the instance when it is. This is another thing you can do pretty early. We just keep the raid alive with people playing on alts, or if nobody is actively playing just have a bank alt with an auto invite addon in the group.
---
It might sound like a lot of effort, and in a way it is. But you can do most of it while watching youtube or netflix. If you grab your songflower and warchief buffs without having to wait then the whole process takes around 20 minutes.
---
I don't join loot council guilds, never have, but I've watched their officers and GM magically get geared out before anyone else lol. Then they say DKP is unfair and I know it's because they can't prioritize themselves for everything because reasons. 
---
"Oh I'm MT and need 8 piece for threat"
---
-yeah, in bwl maybe, not in this content, and you already have t2 helm why didn't you give that to OT if you planned on going 8/8
---
"Well gear needs to stay in guild and this way I can carry the runs"
---
-well you're ensuring I can poach your loot starved dps, and no one is that important especially in this content
---
It's all bs, and yeah there are ways to make dko corrupt, but they are obvious and difficult to attempt to explain away
---
The classic experience is close but not vanilla.  The biggest difference is the players, focus is on being the best as opposed to mindlessly exploring etc.
---
My view on classic is its still better than retail.
---
I am playing way more than expected, and similar amount to back then. (2 60s in vanilla, 2 60s in classic)
---
The changes to classic make it a different experience than vanilla.  I would say the first 2-3 weeks of leveling provided a similar experience to vanilla but once end game was reached by many the experience shifted to a more modern mindset.  The changes to dungeons over the course of vanilla resulted in the gutted versions we have today.  I would enjoy a classic+ were the 60 dungeons were restored to their more brutal form.  The most exact memory I compare to is BRD throne room.  Before the nerfs the mobs were all elite except for 1-2 regular mobs.  The mobs we have are 1 elite and the rest non elites.
---
Friggin fantastic.  I waited to pick a server and get a name until after release had occurred, because I didn't want to pay for 2 weeks of no play time just to get a name reserved.  As a result, I ended up on a smaller server that has been perfect for me.  None of the pvp problems others are experiencing, found an awesome guild that my wife, best friend and I all get to raid in together.  It's been exactly what I was hoping for.
---
search the subreddit and read threads like I have
---
I’ve always wondered why people would choose to play on PvP servers at all.  Seems like such a waste of time.
---
We dont feel bad for you at all. Go to retail scrub
---
Honestly once classic got some attention and some private servers like nostalrius blew up we had the very same situation on them as well, we said it and we got shit on for that.
---
People rather believed some asmongolds or tipsout content creators who praised wpvp to the heavens and now they cry like a baby and play retail again rather than continue classic because "ohhh mommy those guys on the internet killed me ingame, thats not for I dont like this I go play retail again where I have my anti social isolated safespace where nobody can hurt me".
---
I just have the fckfinger for everyone who shittalked the community who told you this will be like this and rather believed some idiot content creator who never even played classic but pretends to be the all mighty god of vanilla.
---
Every word of what you just said was wrong. GL fam.
---
I agree Blizzard definitely should've stepped in to prevent this, but there are some players who've purposely added to the imbalance on both Alliance and Horde. I've got a buddy that's one of them we rolled Alliance on Kurinnaxx which is 60/40. All he did was cry about the imbalance which really isn't that bad most the time(peak hours suck though some days). So he searched out a server with 60/40 horde dominance and rerolled Horde.
---
Has anyone seen The Scarlet Executioner Rare in Hearthglen. I spend a ton of time mining, looting chests and killing rares there. There is supposed to be a rare that spawns on top of a tower there but I have never seen him. I have spent whole days there and never seen the scarlet executioner. Anyone killed him or did blizzard forget to put him in the game?
---
isn't peak time more like 20/21 ?
---
Lol. And congrats!
---
Enjoy your ban.
---
Pallys still counter locks pretty well
---
Yeah I just found that out today.  So bears = viable, yay!
---
Being cutting edge is more demanding, but everything prior to that has been purposefully made more casual friendly. The leveling experience is so much more diverse, engaging, and accessible. LFR was made for people like OP. 
---
There is so much previous content to explore in retail, you could have a fulfilling experience and not even be level cap.
---
There's something funny about thinking about all those "if it's red it's dead" and lowbie gankers saying one of their last "alliance scum" before realizing their realm is dead.
---
And that's coming from a Horde player.
---
I'm on Grobb, the big PvP guilds on both factions seem equally matched but every zone is still dominated by gank squads of Horde. There's so many of them that when an Alliance counter gank squad clears them out they just come back with twice the numbers or move on to somewhere else. 
---
Even when we control BRM I still get killed a guaranteed 5-8 times on the way into BRD. 
---
I'm having a hard time believing the people who say the population is evenly matched because I rarely see other level 60 allies out in the world and every time I leave IF I get hunted down by groups of 5 man level 60s at ALL hours of the day. Even at 3-7am every contested zone is camped.
---
The best part is before P2 some were asking for BG's to be delayed so as not to kill World PvP.
---
I'm the retarded one for saying someone who dislikes the game and the community shouldn't play. Big brains over here
---
Fish for money to by cloth probably.
---
&gt;"SLAP IN THE FACE BLIZZARD! SLAP IN THE FACE!"
---
I vividly recall this. Excellent reference.
---
I thought I was bad. 3 dozen runs just for that damn belt. Saw it 6 times and lost rolls on it 5 times. Twice to people who didn't know what it was.
---
All I hear is “more people can get scarab lord”.
---
See I also read this, but when I swap between them I definitely do a bit more damage with dals. Which is a big sad.
---
My PvE server is 50/50 for the level 60s. You still gonna get queues and keep in mind there are a lot fewer PvE than PvP servers.
---
It's just what happens when you have a game that is not perfectly balanced and doesn't enforce an equal amount of people on each side. More people join the slightly stronger side, which gives them an advantage since they have more people. Then people on the weaker side get tired of playing at a disadvantage, so they quit. Now the stronger side has an even larger advantage, causing more people on the weaker side to quit. It's a feedback loop. 
---
Same thing happened in retail with war mode. It started out with horde having a small advantage in numbers. Now it's basically 100% horde. Very few alliance players will opt into it at this point. It's suicide.
---
Why it's different now is that no one knew what was good when WoW came out. They just picked what they liked the look of more. Now we know what's good, and if you want good 1v1 racials you go horde. Alliance has better PvP options for groups, but most people are trying to min max themselves not their group.
---
I don’t really see your point about anything - you’re mad at blizzard for something they warned you about multiple times because you and your guild were personally inconvenienced by it?  Sounds like the problem lies with you and your mentality thinking blizzard brought classic back for you and your guildies to enjoy your way.  Personally, I love having a huge megaserver population, I can always count on being able to find people that are at the same point in the game as I am without having to make compromises; so I wonder why you choose to speak for everyone saying no one enjoys it?
---
But I think the point is they are in fact scamming crafting mats. Makes it pretty hard to enchant anything or craft a high level item if the dude can just log off with your mats.
---
Not my gf, but thanks for that. Probably why girls who stream content don't have many views lol
---
There's no mass exodus because only horde is allowed to transfer but they won't, they like the imbalance. Alliance cannot transfer off and must endure hour long queues and corpse camping unless they reroll or quit.
---
Nah. More horde period. Horde que times will be drastically greater than any alliance toons.
---
The social punishment is Alliance leaving the server.
---
Well here I am
---
People are doing more DPS in MC with pre-raid &amp; T1 than most Vanilla players did in Naxx with T2 &amp; T2.5. I know it's popular to say Naxx will be extremely hard, but it's more on the level of a retail Normal raid.
---
I even remember running T4 pugs in late TBC with a minimal requirement of 200 dps. And yes, you always had a few players players that finished a fight under that.
---
Maybe not treat the alliance as other humans o,aging a game instead of a mining node?
---
I got Maynard on my server :p
---
Its good if an mmo doesnt babysit the players and have the developer hands up your ass making sure you playing it correctly. Its opens up the natural selection in game and gets rid of the stupid rather quickly.
---
Nope. Titles weren’t implemented until TBC, except for PVP ranks, and the  Scarab Lord title from opening the gates of AQ.
---
 You don't always have a Holy Paladin about, it's usually the rarest spec of a middlingly popular class. 
---
But you've always got your overpowered racials and known/expected faction balance. 
---
You chose Horde knowing it was going to be far, far more populated than a Alliance and have free win PvP abilities. You don't get to tell others off, sorry. 
---
Take the training wheels off, then you can talk.
---
1hr respawn after its been fished. So fish it and time 1hr
---
F in the chat for our fallen brothers and sisters
---
You are under the assumption that those sites are anything remotely accurate.
---
I started by fishing Deviate fish in the Barrens to level up. They Deviate fish sell for a good amount most of the time, and the Smallfish have some value for training early Cooking. I fished Deviates pretty solidly until 300, only leaving to sell the fish or raise my level cap.
---
Then I fished a lot of Winter Squid during Phase 1 in Bay of Storms. They have like a 25-30% catch rate from 12pm to 6pm. They were pretty good until Phase 2 when people started killing me.
---
Then I swapped to fishing Nightfin Snappers in Deadwind Pass. From 12am to 6am they completely replace Sunscales and have a 30% catch rate.
---
Wasn't the fastest grind in the world, but as a Holy Priest my options were a little limited.
---
The great thing about fishing is that the fish have little to no auction house listing fees, so you can demand somewhat lofty prices and there isn't any punishment.
---
I'd recommend setting a maximum price on Runecloth and not buying above it. I personally didn't buy any Runecloth above 6.5s each until the last inventory.
---
Been thinking of doing the same thing here. Wondering if you’ve chosen a server as i would like to play alliance on another server as well but not necessarily faerlina.
---
Yeah man it’s a joke and yes on my server I did the for two weeks before it got popular and I had 3-5 people consistently swimming in the area lol
---
The words are all there, you just have to read them.
---
You can do it, I believe in you.
---
Maybe that’s just your inability to see that saying something is the problem doesn’t mean that all members that have that trait are the problem?
---
My name back in vanilla and BC was Aenimae which got banned.  Then it was LateralUndertow or something like that and then somehow it got switched back to Aenimae IIRC.
---
Stopped as I couldn't find a guild that raids after my work hours. Had a good nostalgia trip overall and can't wait for Shadowlands.
---
Maybe you should get off your ass and help or atleast let your SO have some personal time.
---
Well we'll see how well this comment ages when bgs come around, because I have a feeling that there will still be as many (mostly justified) complaints then as there is now.
---
My impression is that Reddit blows this a little out of proportion. We're in between the launch of honor and the launch of BGs but also before many of those who didn't read up properly understand how cruel the PvP-System actually is. Once players realize how hard Rank 10 on an active server on the dominant side is things should calm down a bit. 
---
I rolled PvE not because I expected this, but because having a game tell me when to play it is a no-no. And I played on PvP in Vanilla, that's enough for a lifetime.
---
Yes
---
And if you want a serious answer it’s 1hr after the spawn has been fished. So pools can randomly spawn if they were fished by someone else. So fish one start a timer and come back when it’s done.
---
&gt;on Heartseeker
---
My potions are much too strong for you, traveler.
---
This makes me want to roll a rogue on a PvP server. 
---
Just for this.
---
Who said anything about being mad?
---
And why should we destroy our guild just to move from one broken server to another? The only choice is extreme overpopulation or extreme faction imbalance.
---
How is that a "solution" to the problem?
---
Outside of raids Paladins actually are amazing tanks, and have the best AoE threat generation. Ret is pretty gimmicky in pve, but if you don't need another healer for raid they do acceptable damage and bring a lot of utility still. PvP they are absolute gods in any spec, and have a lot of fun mutt builds you can play with. I played Paladin in Vanilla and had decent fun in pve, but pvp really is where they are the most fun in my opinion.
---
Not for level 60. There are more horde than alliance on 60 and I can tell you this. On my server Mirage Raceway there is a significant group of elders who hate pvp, there is like a guild full of 50-75 yr olds and they only pve. I keep all my characters in different guilds and there are just so many people who would go "lol pvp" if you asked them about anything pvp related.
---
 There are of course normal guilds but there is a large portion of people who really got zero pvp intrest, but also many who does have the intrest. It's not enough to balance out the overall ratio for BG queues.
---
This is the internet anymore. People will argue over anything, even when you reach the point where you know for a fact you’re not even arguing over the same thing they’ll keep it going. You can apologize or point out the failure to communicate, but that rarely works out well. Being misquoted because you aren’t hyper specific. Great times.
---
You definitely write posts like the kind of guy who jerks off to pics of Grom.
---
Iceblock, Coldsnap, Iceblock, Frostnova -&gt; Run
---
^standard mage combo
---
Oh yeah, I don't mind it most of the time.  Calamitous Intent guarantees I get some quick free honor daily just chilling in my own main city.
---
Yeah, the horde seem really organized to me compared to what I saw while leveling on Skeram. There was just so many more. Everyone seemed to be solo, but would always jump into any fight. Didn't feel bad for all the horde I killed in Hillsbrad.
---
Good for you dude. It's one thing to ha e your priorities messed up, it's another to realize it and make a change.
---
You are so fucking clueless it hurts.
---
My video card died before I hit 60 and I'm saving up for my buddy's destination wedding so I can't afford a new one right now. 
---
On the plus side I'm putting a lot more hours into my switch
---
Honestly the smaller to medium size servers seem to be more closer to the vanilla experience that a lot of people had in mind compared to the larger servers. They're a more tight-knit community.
---
I was playing an undead warrior on Smolderweb when classic released because my first server choice had something like an 18 hour queue and it made me realize that the servers released *after* launch would be a ton like vanilla.
---
Similar server populations to vanilla because of the server size increases + the fact that all the established guilds that were planning on making communities on classic would be playing on other servers. It was a completely blank slate where no one really knew each other.
---
Well, you see now whenever I log in there are parties of raid geared people camping every quest area, fp, dungeon etc. And server health is tanking. I run around and hardly see alliance players anywhere outside the reach of guards.
---
He was probably trying to use it on a gouge or blind which it won’t work on. It will work on the opening stun (cheap shot) and combo stun (kidney shot).
---
I have a 60 warrior, 60 pal and a 60 druid. I currently only play my druid/war he wasn't against any class that could possibly stop him there lol. He also had a pocket paladin.
---
Damn that sucks, I have still only seen the belt drop that one time I got it and I saw the ogre boss 4 times out of those 88 haha
---
It was confirmed months ago you can literally just Google it.
---
Paladins are actually pretty good at tanking they just lack a taunt and that's really it.
---
Gonna need to find a Palpatine for that tale!
---
Your math is way off. 2.5 times 13 is 32.5hours.
---
What does this have to do with classic? (Honest question. I'm not seeing the connection).
---
Have him play a frost mage.  He just needs to press one key, and then he can raid with you.
---
Thanks man, it’s been great and this game is honestly the most fun I’ve ever had in a video game. I hope that it continues to prosper for years to come.
---
I'm pretty sure the BG's will be the same.  The problems they are addressing won't be present in a limited population BG.  I hope.
---
It actually is fun.  But bgs will be even better.
---
Yeah but after the first one everyone is going to be back at the capital
---
Yep. Lol
---
Gatta love a father taking a step back and checking his priorities! Good luck to you sir and have a great time with your family!
---
Dick move by Blizzard. They do it right with Starcraft and the WCS.
---
whats the world coming to
---
Clearing speed
---
And you didn't mention warlock? 
---
How about paladin with lay on hands, 10 second invulnerability, and reckoning bomb?
---
how about shaman with spellbatched double crit oneshot?
---
How about a warrior with FAP, rocket boots and a heal/dispel bot in the back? Unstoppable killing machine.
---
Now I'm not saying it is balanced, but many things are pretty broken in classic, and that's what makes things fun. To an extent, there is some semblance of balance on the high-end; when everything is broken, nothing is.
---
relevant to blizzard as a whole, but asmongold is the most notable classic streamer
---
I play on a balanced server, but I am really concerned of what is happening on the others.
---
I think this problem may only cause two things
---
1- people leave the game
---
2- the balanced servers may become unbalanced
---
Each way is bad.
---
Continuing to say no changes in such situation is like having cancer and not trying to heal.
---
only 1 ap from agility and strenght.
---
All other classes get 2 ap from their main attribute
---
Nothing is mandatory. You will just be a little slower to the high ranks if you even intend to rank at all. After r4 I believe you can only get 1 rank a week.
---
If you are able to kill anyone solo John Rambo style.
---
My faction isn’t broken. You were warned about these problems several times.  I read about faction balance and rerolled months ago when it was relevant.  Just took a few minutes, honestly.
---
Incendius has a good balance and a healthy population
---
Almost impossible. “Hey, transfer to this server that has you outnumbered 9-1. Soon it’ll be 4-1. Maybe 3-1. We’re hoping for 2-1. Please.” You’re forcing the faction at a disadvantage to do something to fix the problem when it’s the dominant faction that’s the problem.
---
Smaller faction’s Econ’s might be in bad shape.  Harder to sell boes and harder to buy supplies in larger quantities. 
---
Also smaller faction still gets their cities camped on pve realms.  This includes dead Auctioneers and FP masters.
---
High Marshal for alliance
---
I have a 4 year old son myself. And as long as he's awake and in the house, I'm not on WoW. 
---
The only exception being the occasional movie night watching Spiderman for the 10th time :-P
---
Just because I don't log 30 hours a week doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to enjoy classic, the game is not that big. In fact were it not for the people that do log these ridiculous hours for the sole apparent purpose of ganking all day everyday I would've been approaching 60 and starting dungeon grinding to build up a raid set about now.  I guess I made a mistake by rolling PvP. But c'mon man, retail is trash. Let's not go there.
---
Has nothing to do with being idiots, it just wasn’t the norm.
---
Players learn new things and adopt them to their game over time, that’s sort of how video games have always worked.
---
I'd lol at them for wasting so much time destroying pvp servers.
---
He got the first nightfall on the first tick of his corruption. Imo that's pretty extraordinary and the rest of the whole sequence wouldn't have happened in that way if he didn't get it plus the druid would've been out of range. It's not like he's in a bg and keeping corruption up left and right and then gets this sequence after a minute of fighting.
---
Stop posting this low effort shit from idiot streamers.
---
I agree that the situation is pretty awful but we're talking about grinding to high ranks here, which you do through BGs now. A lot of people do enjoy those.
---
RIP
---
There's a pack in lbrs that if los'd will do a back and forth pat a few times before coming over. One caster has to be aggroed and los'd be a second player or it just stands there.
---
Yeah it's more for these silly situations and also because I know I'm the 5th tank in line, so I might as well aim for an item that will make these dungeon runs more fun.
---
[MFW the Horde have run out of anyone to gank](https://gfycat.com/clutteredwastefulcuscus-congratulations-you-played-yourself)
---
Can anyone confirm this?
---
I think Blizzard would rather offer the paid transfer to a PVE than have them quit. After all a player who quits has the same effect on a server that the same person transferring off does. Why not make a little money
---
I have a one year old. I feel ya. My rule is I only play when baby is asleep. Period.  Occasional nap times but only join instances/raid after she is down.  Moderation is key.  
---
Props for putting family first
---
30yo zoomers
---
I've never had to ask for dps more than twice before getting at least 3 pms for any relevant dungeon at reasonable times.
---
Maybe not dominated but you can feel that Alliance has better numbers on Zandalar Tribe.
---
Was just thinking this. Get max rank, buy gear, wait for paid transfers.
---
Specs? Sure. Classes? No. Every class has something were they are the best or very useful at.
---
Its difficult with pugs as your options are limited, you can't exactly run dkp or loot council but you should find out what the plan is when you have a full raid and if it's still free roll, find another guild. 
---
You can also help yourself by helping to recruit those last few spots.
---
I assume you are short of priests and are pugging them ? I don't see why the guild would have rolls on priest tier unless you had to pug some.
---
I'm not sure why, might be because they get really low crit from agility
---
Also a good amount of their power comes from flat increases such as hunter's mark, aspect of the hawk... they don't have many % increase talents
---
how about raid in the night when your kid sleeps?
---
same here. 
---
7:30pm - ...
---
and lunch time naps occasionally. 
---
works great.
---
But the cool kids were going PvP...!
---
Sure someone got better rank, but he will kill last Alliance low lvl on this realm. What a champion!
---
I hope the "you suck at PVP go to PVE" guy is on one of the servers that dies lol.
---
You must not have read my full post, or you’re ignorant.  I’m not complaining about queues whatsoever.  I remote login to my account before I leave work, and by the time I get home the queue is up.  No big deal.  The day that I disconnected and had to sit in queue, I just didn’t play that night, again no big deal.  But as a PAYING customer, we shouldn’t have to be forced to sit in a queue and not be able to play.  I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t play on a low population server while waiting in a queue for a full population server.  The concept here is the same thing as being able to build up first aid while waiting for a boat or zeppelin lol.
---
It's higher. All data for PvE servers pre- and post-census addon breaks points to every single one being 70%+ Alliance.
---
You seem to have missed the point. Analogies don't need to line up with every facet of the things they compare. For instance:
---
 Lots of folks have been waiting years to play this game. Many more of us have been dissatisfied with wow for years as well and came to classic to enjoy it. Even if we didn't play in vanilla (I started in tbc) it's a lot closer to the game we love and we want to savor it. Ya know like an $80 steak..
---
Interesting, from an RP perspective, would be to associate 'traitor' questlines to the faction change. So you could remain an orc shaman while transferring to the alliance.
---
Not worried about queues here.  No problems actually for me.  I find my way around queues.  This idea of mine is one that would be beneficial to the game, Bud.
---
/u/HontonoKershpleiter 
---
explain this
---
Sorry but [basic statistics say you're wrong] (http://www.tools4dev.org/resources/how-to-choose-a-sample-size/) 
---
&gt;A good maximum sample size is usually around 10% of the population, as long as this does not exceed 1000. For example, in a population of 5000, 10% would be 500. In a population of 200,000, 10% would be 20,000. This exceeds 1000, so in this case the maximum would be 1000.
---
&gt;Even in a population of 200,000, sampling 1000 people will normally give a fairly accurate result. Sampling more than 1000 people won’t add much to the accuracy given the extra time and money it would cost.
---
Please god tell me the addon that shows your debuff son the name plate. I heard it is ElvUI but I got that and it changed everything. I got neat plates too but that addon is kinda fucked.
---
Is leatherworking worth levelling on a rogue, or should I just grab herbalism?
---
A word of advice, green quests. If you still have green Tirisfal quests, do them. The same with Durotar quests. Otherwise, yes, go do Barrens quests until you are left with only yellows, then go back to do Silverpine elites if they are green at that point. Always do quests when they are green, and never before, past level 10. It's the best xp/hour you can get. You hardly ever die; you don't have to worry about accidentally pulling another mob, as you can kill adds; you'll pull less adds, because of a smaller aggro radius; and you have less downtime, as it requires less resources to kill mobs; this leads to more kills and more xp. If you are left with no green quests, grind a dungeon or 3 to get drops/xp to make leveling even easier. If you do things this way, you'll have ALL the lvl 55+ zones to do at 60 to do for raw gold. Skip green quests, and you'll run out of yellows, forcing you to do oranges, which is much like banging your head against the wall. Furthermore, you'll end up like many of my guildies, and be forced to straight grind from lvl 56ish till 60, which isn't pleasant.
---
Yeah the gaming community has changed so badly .. beinf toxic and trolling is fun ... dont care if the other side has their game time ruined only your personal gaming exp counts.
---
Best thing back than was the community .
---
Kind of people always existed but now its far more
---
Picking one faction over another isn't the only thing that's being done, you're just being dishonest.
---
Rolling a rogue on a fresh server. Should I bother levelling leatherworking on my run thru 1-60 or am I better off with quest gear and just grabbing herb/mining with my skinning?
---
The few TBC private servers that launched without some sort of faction control  were all 90-95% Horde. The most successful ones (not many because they're usually buggy and filled with microtransactions) have outright blocked the creation of Horde characters pass a certain point.
---
Faction ultimately doesn't matter in Vanilla because your PvP rank is relative to your own faction. But Horde absolutely dominates Arenas in TBC, so whatever imbalance we're experiencing now in Classic will be 10 times worse in TBC.
---
windfury totem.
---
not kidding. thats like 90% of the reason.
---
Yeah this is very concerning, I'm on a PVE server now, but I never thought that this would actually happen to some PVP realms. What could they possibly do to fix this?
---
In terms of active 60’s, that’s not true at all. Flight masters are camped 24/7 by the horde.
---
Whiteman’s chapeau is exactly the item I was thinking of when I read OPs post.  Never got that thing while leveling.
---
We all know a lot of people saw that horde had a slight number advantage and went “fuck that, looks like I’m rolling horde” and it snowballed.
---
You *absolutely* can blame them for being afraid to play w/o an advantage. They’re also most likely the same people saying “PvP happened”.
---
But yeah, def blame blizz more. Open up faction transfer and put a % of imbalance based penalty honor decay rate penalty (increase) an Xp penalty so less people roll that fancyion there and gimp alts - on any faction with a 55+% pop imbalance of level 60’s who play more than 10hrs a week.
---
We all quit playing in high school because of time and not staying in touch as much due to me moving halfway across the country
---
Does elemental earth sell fairly often? I ended up with a stack of it but was going to try so sell it bit by bit.
---
To have fun.
---
Better off with quest gear, or have a LW craft you anything you really want.
---
Pass on skinning too unless you plan to raid and need to skib ony/corehounds
---
&gt; Just because I don't log 30 hours a week doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to enjoy classic
---
This is the wrong part, because classic doesnt have the desire to provide fun for every single individual player type like retail does. Retail offers so many different aspects and on top offers so much personal s a f e s p a c e with zoning and instancing and layering that people can play the game entirely as a single player game, collecting pets, doing pet battles, doing achievments, do old raids alone, you can just queue into dungeons from your s a f e s p a c e etc. 
---
Classic is different because here you are forced out into the world having to rely on people to progress and on pvp servers you are always in fear of battle.
---
Classic is a world connected and always moving forward, you cant avoid the impact of the world on you and ultimately the game doesnt have to be fun for everyone or offer "something" for people who dont like to be part of the world.
---
If I log on right now I will find plenty of people doing things they like, accepting things they dont like, being part of the eco system. And classic is for those people, those who can log on today and still enjoy the positives and accept the negatives of the game.
---
Its not for people who say "I just want to have the good things and blizzard should change everything to make the bad things go away"
---
Thats not how a world works, if you dont accept the bad things you are not the audience classic is for.
---
Hell yea man I’m all for it. Sounds like an awesome time! Not sure if you saw an earlier response but I’m definitely resubbing after Monday
---
There have to be enough people on the server/faction for you to be a high enough percentile to quality for the higher tiers of ranking points.
---
If too few people have the 15 HK/week then it's literally impossible to get rank 14 and this was observed for some weeks on smaller vanilla servers.
---
So what do you think, will they make BG xrealm group with pvp and pve servers mixed together or not?
---
Honestly, just my take on it, but you CLEARLY do care what other people think of you, seeing as you posted a "flex" post to strangers. Wouldn't surprise me if you just made this up for karma, this sub is filled with shitty posts like this anyways.
---
Damn bro. That’s the first rule of technical support, turn it off and on again
---
neat plates. I use it and love it. 
---
Now if bliz would just roll back the hotfix on the nameplate distance...
---
See idk. I love how you spun that analogy btw, but I feel like were it not for the min maxers slavishly reading detailed blogs about how to wipe their shoes and tie their asses, classic wow would be just about the best game there is. So to me it is the 5* restaurant, it just happens to be full of rabid monkeys.
---
Still takes 5 minutes
---
Grand Marshal\* :P
---
Only procs on initial tick of immo/explosive traps. Can’t remember if it’s vanillalike or not. Check the hunter bug list, should be in there.
---
Firemaw but the alliance still have a good portion of raid loggers and in general people who dont care about pvp so half the faction afks in IF..
---
I don't think they were initially. I suppose I didn't look into how they'd do it in classic. So they'll be XR from the beginning?
---
Ding ding
---
Ah yes I remember when blizzard said to all horde players: camp all zones 24/7 or get banned
---
Blizzard still could do this at some point. They’re desperate.
---
I read his post, and he says that a small part of his views them as cowards. He also says that he has slightly more respect for those that stayed.
---
The words 99% and 'slightly' are used to try and make it sound like a big deal, but in fact, when a person 'has' to mention it, and in this case twice, that means that a hell of a lot more than 1% of them doesn't blame them lol. 
---
When someone cares that little, they won't even bother to mention that part. He mentions it because he is either lying to himself, or is trying to sound nice when in fact, he isn't.
---
I'm pretty good at the financial aspects of this game.
---
Finally, someone who isn’t fucking stupid.
---
You’re telling a hunter to bring melee consumes. We don’t need that STR/melee AP.
---
Legs.
---
The minority you describe is pretty much the way I see the game being played on my lower pop pve server.
---
Noob question: How much (estimated) does one have to play go get Rank 10 and/or 11?
---
Fair enough man. Like I said, when phase 2 dropped, I couldn’t level at all and there was literally more alliance in org than horde, but that was like 3-4 days after phase 2. I didn’t think to screenshot and I left the server as well due to not even being able to find a guild to do dungeons to farm my pre raid. I’m in Org right now and it’s a ghost town. There’s only 2 alliance that I seen atm(rogue and Druid) farming honor.
---
That is not an accurate math as he doesn't counted in that its happened for the first two ticks of corruption which matters because you wouldnt killed druid otherwise.
---
Some of us have jobs, marriages, or kids. The idea that you had to get sixty in the first month or the game is unplayable is completely ridiculous.
---
I'm a druid.
---
Yeah, I goofed rolling pvp.
---
What server/faction are you if you don't mind me asking?
---
&gt;120 degree breath, 90 degree tail swipe. don't get hit
---
&gt;
---
&gt;anyone who cannot add those 2 together in order to find out a safe spot
---
So, where is 210 degrees on the map?
---
So you’re saying if I have pvp disabled when I HS to IF then I’ll be flagged for 5 minutes?
---
This is very true. I just dont run any BRM because I ain't got time for that horrible death run. No horde on incendius has said, well, ever.
---
I would think a $20 video card or onboard graphics would run classic.
---
DO NOT ROLL ON BLAUMEUX IF YOU ARE ALLIANCE AT LEAST 50%-30% TRANSFERRED
---
Also played lock on a private server. The highest non crit shadowbolts I got (Full phase 4 BiS equivalent) were around 2.5k with flask+shadow vulnerability+shadow weaving
---
With Details, how do you see damage done for the entire raid thus far, instead of just the last fight?
---
You save all the chat data on txt files on your computer you’re saying those are lost too? Also you should have gotten a detailed email about the reason of the ban
---
Wait.  Honestly, with only MC its cancer, having 40 people who need raid loot and only a couple pieces drop every week.  But when BWL and ZG come out, loot is significantly easier to obtain because there is more of it and people have been farming for a while.
---
Everyone has loot problems right now.  My warrior has been running MC/ony sense week 3 of the game as the main tank and until last week I didn't have more than 3 pieces of raid loot.  We didn't see a single wrath helm until last week (doing every ony lockout), and still have not seen wrath pants once.  Some items, with their drop rates, you might only see 2-3 times per year.  Just gotta stay committed and keep showing up, preferably with the same group/guild so that once someone gets the item there is less competition the next time it drops.
---
It was just stated that the Dwarf was a warrior
---
You won't die from classic wow having less players. You will eventually die of cancer. Classic isn't here to cater to everyone, that's retail. Classic is just classic. If you like changes to classic pirate servers are probably more your speed.
---
Org is arguably the easiest city to raid. Hitting the back and going down that strip is stupid easy to do.
---
In full BiS with Flask you hit for 2k+ with CoS. Noncrit
---
I can’t even get my lvl 41 up anymore because all the zones I need to level in are very heavily contested and camped by 60s :(
---
upvoted for human warlock
---
Only one person has to queue in a group, the rest can still be roaming.
---
A lot of people have legitimately quit
---
I saw humans on tigers. They probably paid hundreds of gold to get them
---
I'm almost level 60 on my Tauren Druid on Whitemane right now, but if given the chance I would faction change so hard to be Night Elf. I rolled Horde thinking that was where my nostalgia and friends would be but I hate that my character isn't pretty T~T
---
Don't forget the +15 engineering skill that's broken for twinks.
---
When someone gets so fixated on an inconsequential detail that they can't even step back and see the conversation, you know you're dealing with someone whose elevator doesn't reach the top.  
---
His post history was full of him arguing with people in r/ultrawidemasterrace and similar subreddits.  Kind of sized him up as someone not worth trying to maintain a serious conversation.  Red flags in every direction.  Might as well have fun.
---
Pretty much all you can do if you're going to stick around the internet forums.  Have normal conversations when you can and then roll with the weirdos when they get in your face until they get tired of their reflection.
---
It’s unique. If you use it, you can’t craft more and sell them anymore.
---
Man, this system is really terrible then. You can't rank up if you have competition on your side, since it just increases the honor required to maintain at top standing, but you can't rank up if you have no competition because of the way it's round. It's damned if you do, damned if you don't.
---
Not necessarily,  its mainly  just vanilla style world pvp... connected servers not so much since there are so many servers connected so youll never be overpopulated by the opposing faction, this doesnt exist in classic.
---
The  servers wont be able to handle it if people pushed it... also theres no reason  to do this scale world pvp in BFA. You can just do BGs instead.
---
20 days 20 hours for me
---
Horde are way more co-ordinated than alliance on it, very visible with world bosses and general pvp. World pvp has been OK but horde just camp everlook/ BRM, sometimes EPL/WPL hubs while alliance are more about roaming around looking for fights, looking forward to BGs as it’s hard work getting honor from ganking 1/2 people because of this ~ 5-7k honour a day atm.
---
I'm on herod as alliance, and all my horde buddies tell me its balanced.
---
Yeah, no.  You're in denial.  As someone that decided it wasn't worth my time playing anymore I can say trying to level in the 50+ zones is impossible.  Not dealing with it.
---
I'm not a dad but I get where you're coming from. It's hard to be a tryhard these days when you've got other priorities. Sure you could probably get by continuing to play and just running a dungeon here and there each week but as someone who also wants to be good and top meters, etc. it takes time and that's hard to come by these days. Good on you for setting your priorities straight and recognizing real. GL brother!
---
Maybe you just play at the wrong times cause they're not.
---
You sound like a douche, not on this server, but enjoy being on the 1st official dead one.
---
Your comment doesn't make sense.
---
What's with the diary entry?
---
You must realize that most of the tryhards have been doing this over and over again on pservers for 5+ years and gone through the entire vanilla wow cycle several times at this point.  What makes you think they are going to burn out this time?  If anything,  the tryhard demographic is the most reliable bloc that will still be playing come phase 5/6.
---
No offence or anything but it sounds like you went non stop hard core and now burnt out. Your prob best case is to quit. 
---
I have kids too and i only raid late night when they are sound asleep, trying to balance myself and not get burnt out, working so far.
---
Good luck!
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers horde side.  It is lower pop faction.  We still have people leveling up, doing lower level dungeons, new raid groups forming, etc but not tons. It’s definitely life in the slow lane.  Our economy isn’t very robust.  We have some great guilds though and I love where I am now.
---
Alliance camp Org btw.  That’s a bit demoralizing lol but we just don’t get our act together enough to defend.  I have alts in Allie side and I can tell it’s a bit more “aggressive” play style there but still pretty chill.
---
multibox bad
---
Not if you are a gnome and its a chicken :(
---
Totally agreed!! I’ve been perplexed at the seemingly blind-eye people have turned to auctioneer and it’s ability to give the user much more ability and information than the average user.
---
for anyone not getting the reference

[Recount](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/recount/files/all) might be what you’re looking for.
---
Agreed!!
---
No we are brave
---
Fair enough!
---
"Forced to get rewards to play the game."
---
Homie, that's literally every RPG ever made.
---
I was in this situation. Being the guilds best dps while not getting any loot at all, week after week loosing rolls. Still topping the dmg meeter while some people in the guild started getting good gear.
---
The GM recognised this and gave me the Ony head. So that was cool of them. 
---
Then I raided with some friends one week since they told me I would be defaulted all my class loot. We cleared MC in 1,5 hours, compared to my guilds 4. That’s just too much irl time saved to pass up. I left my guild and now have full epic and a happier girlfriend since the raids aren’t as long.
---
Raid logs are very flawed too. You could have 60:40 server pop but for people experiencing the real world and not just raid logging it could easily be 80:20
---
How the hell would that help anything? Spreading 8k horde and 3k alliance isn't going to fix anything when 90% of servers are 65%+ horde...
---
Congratulations. You have selective attention.
---
So what, just collude with alliance (who are also interested in unlocking this phase) and sell all of the mats on neutral AH at 1 copper. Easy solution to a simple problem.
---
The timers are independent from pool to pool. Roughly (there's some degree of randomness) an hour after one of the spots has been fished, the pool there will reappear.
---
Yeah, we ban randoms from having guns for no reason and nazis. The horror.
---
I wish i was able to do a (paid) transfer from pve&gt;pvp! Im an Ally on a EU RP-PVE server and my only transfer option is towards a german rp server. I rather play on 10% vs 90% pvp than pve
---
You'd just be trading one shitty situation for another.
---
it doesnt work like that. You still need to farm a minimum amount of honor to get it even if you no longer compete against other players.
---
Someone did a census on earthshaker last night. It was almost perfectly 50/50 for lvl 60.
---
They do, I've noticed a lot of people presume a warrior landing a series of crits must have burned reck. No, warriors are just capable of some stupid burst, reck is just a guarantee it will happen.
---
I think our server is pretty good! 
---
Alliance seems plenty strong there!
---
&gt;*tie their asses*
---
Those min-maxing blogs *do* say this is an acceptable alternative to [poopsocking](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Poopsocking)...
---
Herod Horde here. Id say go for Herod alliance, the corpse runs for brd are basically equal. Id argue BRM is held by alliance more frequently. DM is more of the horde dominated region, which still has its upsets with alliance controlling randomly at times too.
---
Yea shit takes ages. 
---
I've  seen clearing mc since October every week, 10/10 with the raid guild. I have t2 head, and 3/8 t1 with bennidiction. Most of our priests are about on par with me.
---
That being said, /rolling for stuff is whack yo
---
We’re talking about faction imbalance, not population.
---
Standard raid build is 4, 1 main and 3 off tanks, although most of the time those offtanks aren't doing a whole lot (at least in MC).  Later raids utilize off tanks a lot more, but your 4th tank is gonna be stuck nightfalling half the boss fights.
---
As a druid, you're looking for like a 3rd tank or 4th tank position as a melee buffer and situational tank (very good on select fights; broodlord, thaddius, bug trio).  You suffer from not having multiple taunts, block or sunder armor, and the problems are exacerbated as the game goes into the later stages, but right now they are very good.
---
Best part is they were shit talking so hard while doing it and making fun of alliance and telling them to roll on a PvE server.. enjoy your dead server, fucking idiots
---
You do not need to go fury prot.for threat unless you have a parse chasing guild. Stay deep prot and wear threat gear and you will be fine in 90 percent of guilds. Tac mastery is worth it and the asmon watchers really have no clue what they're doing.
---
Yes, much more wild playing the faction with the dead human, green human, blue human with tusks and last but certainly the least, the cow :D
---
Herod and Skeram are the highest difficulty checks as far as playing alliance though. If that’s up your alley then have at it brother. I might recommend other more balanced (a bit) servers like Benediction or something
---
are we sure those numbers are correct ? those pages show my realm with a 44/56 split in favour for the horde but man it feels the other way. I am getting ganked by ally death squads constantly.
---
What are you talking about? We controll alot of zones and are constantly back and forth who has the controll. Only the pve neets hide in the city.
---
It is an awesome game, but it is lacking content compared to tbc/wotlk. So now I am just raid loging.
---
Which is just fine, because I did not intent to be super tryhard anyway.
---
Hmmm.... It's almost as if instead of blaming everyone playing the game and doing their best to get some progress at any cost, you could instead blame the shitty honor system in wpvp.... hmm... Nah, must be the toxic peoples.
---
Nice! I've got my last exam on Monday so I'll be on a bunch after that!
---
roll a bunch of 19 alts get em 15 hks each lol
---
wholesome post
---
Noob question:  why get a pet as a rogue? I’m leveling my first rogue and haven’t heard of rogues doing that.
---
not when you're minmaxing
---
I  hope you're having a blast as a first timer!  
---
This is the game that swallowed my soul long time ago... it was a glorious! And it still is!   
---
well... maybe the graphics look a bit older now. ;)
---
Maybe one day soon he’ll be old enough for you to pull him in to the world of Azeroth so you two can share a great hobby. 
---
Kudos brother, take care wherever you are.
---
Well there is about 40 people left. Not a big lost
---
Listen to people?
---
&gt;	I dont claim to have proof
---
99% of this subreddit when making any claims
---
Can I have your gold?
---
Put HS in zone you want to gank in, queue in org/stormwind, ghetto hearth in RFC/stockades, resume ganking while in queue.
---
Oh is that the calamitous intent from stalagg? I just realized I haven't seen them in ages.
---
Thanks buddy. My days of playing mmo's competitively are long gone haha, I don't care about what's the optimum way of levelling and what gear I *should* be using.
---
This is actually my first time ever playing wow because I was a Runescape player when i was a kid. So I'm just trying to enjoy the journey 😊👍
---
They’re not absolute because blizzard decided to withhold that info. But it’s the most accurate we’ve got. 
---
Sometimes your situation is due to the opposing faction having more 60s, more coordination with guilds, or it’s just bias and if you were to swap sides it would be worse. 
---
Not that you don’t have it rough from salty alliance players, but maybe the other side is even worse.
---
I genuinely don't think they care, and I also don't think they are going to invest a single cent into this game they don't have too.
---
Yeah that's the problem you have 2 Sites.
---
One side think it's not fair/fun to be camped at flight points for ez Honor and quit. They write into the forums that they want a fix.
---
But:
---
Then come the "OmG pVp Ob A pVp SeRvEr" circlejerker and insult and Attack everyone who mentions unfair pvp / bad balance (also happens on this subred, it's hillarious and stupid).
---
So who will they listen to? The players that complain once in a thread - or the group that comments under each post that it isn't so bad, that this is PvP and that people have to stfu.
---
Sadly the last group gets Blizzard attention (they are everywhere and woe always 4-5 accounts that agree with them - they must be right) and so Servers will die, PVP Servers will be almost PvE and people will complain - again.
---
We were using a +1 system until switching to loot council, meaning one player can only get one tier piece and one non-tier piece until rag, and then it resets on rag. This made sure that one rogue didn't run with all the loot just because he was lucky etc
---
Stormscale EU was at least 90% horde too
---
there is still a rank of SB not in the game yet
---
Op calling people with different opinions morons :) go retail you baby -an alliance on a horde dominated realm
---
I simply pointed out that Reddit isn't a monolith, and it's impossible for everyone to be happy about any one thing, which you somehow extrapolated into Blizzard being right about people not wanting classic.
---
You somehow took this as "crying", which is honestly indicative of the intelligence behind your first post.
---
The very definition of shitposting.
---
This.
---
We’re running a great parent-friendly guild over on EU-Razorgore. We’re even clearing MC/Ony after the kids sleep. We don’t really like the state of the world atm, but we still manage to run dungeons and have a blast.
---
It’s all about finding your community.
---
Come say hi!
---
Neither do the comments blaming a particular faction player for actions being done by everyone.
---
I play horde ergo I'm a cunt, apparently
---
You are a fat lonely nerd go outside
---
I mean if a hunter rolls on HOJ they deserve to be ridiculed.
---
Found the 14 year old!
---
Thinking I might reroll pve. Would you say the amount of PvP is pretty good on your server?
---
You’d think but you need to kill the horde to get those points. Your 10 man gank party will be hunted down by an 80 man Zerg thirsty for some HK
---
You are mistaken. Several pservers implemented honor before BGs.
---
dm:t
---
Non-combat pets are vanity items. Use them for roleplay or just because you like having a cat/rabbit/snake/panda follow you around.
---
Printscr is for alliance tryhards
---
That's not really an options when entire zones are filled with horde players. I did start this weekend, and while most servers have lhc ganking, flamelash had groups of horde everywhere between lhc and the instance. Once you got away from the first group, the second one started killing you.
---
Flamelash was already dying on alliance side before everyone transfered, because people just stopped playing.
---
😂😂😂
---
I rolled on a PvE server, which i'm thankful for, but the problem with PvE servers is that there really isn't a ton of PvP, and the PvP that you get is very specific and not very diverse which causes boredom, and lots of people quit the game because of the lack of things to do honestly.
---
great post. your family should be a priority above wow. if a compromise cannot be reached then choose family.
---
But i bet majority of those going for R14 are not doing it optimally and thus will fail at it.   
---
Will be interesting to see when the world first Rank 14 actually comes out and the subsequent drama from other people who arent able to ever reach it.
---
Its going to be mega-levels of whining "i grinded this and that hard but only reached 13, 3 weeks in a row now wtf" from many people.
---
I hope not tho...
---
Whitemane is actually one of the more balanced Horde-skewed PvP servers by a solid margin. Census addon data is showing an actual slight *Alliance* (51:49) bias at 60, while raid logs show a more realistic ~57% Horde split. As someone playing on 3:1~4:1 Skeram, I'd kill for Whitemane's H:A ratio.
---
Because the most intelligent, tactful, and skilled group of 20 people will still always lose to 100.
---
Horde on mirage here - it seems great to me all cities are fill of people plenty if groups running dungeons and raids, only time you see an imbalance is when you do pvp but who cares about that really.
---
there's no planning that can help battlegroups if every server is 60/40 horde. mixing pve servers into pvp battlegroups is unlikely since they have an unfair advantage for leveling and getting gear
---
30? Lucky
---
I mean, I think it's really fun.
---
\*justin chancellor exists\*
---
/y I’m gay
---
Paladin is one of the highlight classes in battleground. 
---
Paladin + Warrior was a perfect combination in vanilla and early TBC. Also in arena of TBC, every 5v5 team got to have a Paladin. Then Blizzard kept nerfing it.
---
I'm already leveling a Paladin alt for the incoming battlegrouds.
---
Are you really here for the world's jankiest pvp system? Ouch.
---
Lmao
---
Not to get too abstract and while I can appreciate the point that there are incentive structures built into the game that incentives this type of behavior I wouldn’t absolve the Horde players of their share of blame.
---
Just like in other aspect of life with limited resources and a system of exploitation, it is the collective actions of individuals that leads to this outcome. This whole ordeal feels like an allegory to the Tragedy of the Commons.
---
The question I have is, how many Horde left the server too?  
---
And what's the balance now? (As I believe it was 65/35 before most of the guilds left)
---
How long will the grind to get exalted with AV take?
---
Yeah, do shimmering flats at 30 or 32 or so.
---
If you can possibly run some dungeons, that's definitely the easiest way to bridge the gap. Look up the quests for each dungeon on the internet, and make sure to pick up all of them.
---
It was really tough at first, not gonna lie. I still miss it but have learned to exist without.
---
When I’ve got a better balance between threat and mitigation gear I’ll probably spec full dps and put on a shield when required, forgetting prot all together (though last stand is helpful when the healer is being overwhelmed). The struggle between spec is the blessing and curse of classic haha
---
It'll need to be the case anyway. Imagine throwing PvP Horde players into average 2:1 ratio queues while simultaneously leaving PvE Alliance players in 3:1 ratio queues. It's so illogical that I think we can trust even Blizzard not to do it.
---
Standing doesn't display correctly if you have less than 15 kills, as you're not supposed to have a standing at all. From what I've seen it's just a random number in that case.
---
Looks like Plan B didn't work out any better
---
That's not how it works, and that's also why there's several members on the LC, not one.  
---
Think of a raidteam as a company, the loot council is the board of directors and the items are promotions. The board of directors will decide who gets promoted, based on how much they work, it just makes sense. WoW players who deny loot councils have literally gone further than the communist ideal. The rough idea of Marxism is "distribution based on one's contribution". To think that WoW players are so greedy, that they all seem to think that they deserve more than they work for. All guilds not using loot councils are doing is forcing the ones who make the guild work to take it in the ass lying down because it's either their friends or a fair loot system.
---
I have no sympathy for someone too stupid to know what happens on a pvp server. If you don't like it, go to pve or retail.
---
Too bad crying doesn't actually solve your problems, you guys would be all set.
---
Or just cap server imbalance and servers that have major imbalance you allow limited transfers in and out to help with the imbalance
---
My guess is the price is going to spike when BGs are released, because they're used to make [Restorative Potions](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion), which are super useful in BGs, so if you want the best bang for your buck without holding on to them until phase 5, you can drop what you have the day BGs are released.
---
Pretty casual server since it was a day 2 server. Population bolstered due to BIS name.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. I have been playing private servers for a bit before classic and it has been so bad for my blood pressure. I played PvE in vanilla and now PvE on classic. I can finally just unwind after a day by questing a bit in peace, or running to dungeons unmolested.
---
Whats with the sore tone? The guy gave a level headed answer. I read somewhere the AQ opening will be region wide. And If that was total fake news Blizzard will have either merged servers or opened new migrations before that.
---
The only problem right now is that there are no allies to kill so ranking will be hard this week.
---
Arena/anger/grim guzzler runs and just log out while in the instance. I included the grim guzzler because it has a vendor to offload Grey's and make money.
---
I'm in team 2 of a medicore guild and the Rogues and warriors are pushing My OT on threat. His logs are fine.
---
I just finished leveling my undead mage up to 60 this morning
---
I was level 52 when honor hit.
---
I was level 26 the week before honor hit.
---
Questing became *literally*-not-figuratively impossible after honor hit.
---
EPL, WPL, Un Goro, Winterspring, felwood, are all effectively owned by alliance at all hours of the day and most of the night.
---
SG/BS are similar the few times I've been down there.
---
You cannot walk past the bulwark or through the kargath pass without being instantly killed or chased down by 5~10 alliance in t1+2 and epic mounts.
---
There's 3~4 separate groups of rogues that sit outside the orgrimmar portal hut and their combined coverage is nearly 24/7
---
Undercity gates, courtyard, and elevators are very frequently camped by rogues.
---
There's really only one big difference between our experiences---Not every horde you encounter is looking for pvp, there's just so many of us out in the world that it only takes a small portion of the horde in a zone to ruin things for alliance farming/leveling
---
wteeth 60 who is spending 8+ hours a day on discord with 5~10 other people ruthlessly scouring the zone and all possible hiding spots specifically and exclusively to spawn-camp every single lowbie horde they see.
---
no changes would've been the best option if we really got NO FUCKING CHANGES not all this bullshit they gave us
---
Imagine thinking this comment deserves a valid response. I can talk like that about every class and make them seem overpowered. "Feral druids have stealth, they can stun, daze and root the target to keep him cc'ed forever, they can heal themselves to full and shift out of every root and have endless mobility!" - see?
---
Bought an Unyielding Maul from a hunter who solo‘s tribute runs and we got to chatting while I was en route to the instance. Don’t know what the usual numbers are but he makes around 30g a run by vendoring. But if good stuff drop off the chest, he’ll sell each one for around 30-50g an item. He can clear 100g from one run if he’s lucky. That’s not bad at all.
---
Helping them remember where the nearest graveyard in their current leveling zone is.
---
&gt;People will take advantage of others without thinking about those who are affected by their actions
---
In a game you can take advantages if you need to (if not breaking the EULA).
---
And it's a developers/maintainers's job to keep the game balanced. And if they don't give a shit and failed their job, it should not be the players that get blamed.
---
It's like a counter stricke server with  "mp\_autoteambalance 0", "mp\_teamlimit unlimited". So everyone is joining the winning side or just quit the game.
---
hol' up there! I just did the quest for epic chest Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight. Let me tell you that it wasnt anything easy or fast but i loved the whole quest ( i didnt farm the chromatic carpace from ubrs - it dropped randomly and i won the roll on one of the runs).  
---
The satisfaction of finally getting the epic chest for all the pvp in EPL and WPL to get bloods, all the strat UD runs and meeting people there curious about my quest ( 3 baron capes dropped one after another in 3  consecutive runs! sic!). I loved the expirience to bits :D
---

---
It's the exact same for horde on herod, too.
---
GMs don't know that...
---
Gr8 m8. Did you 8 a Troll ?
---
1: T1 isn't very good for priest.
---
2: the guild you're in is shit if they are consistently only doing 9/10 mc.
---
3: find another guild, other, stronger guilds can always use more healers.
---
4: learn your class, don't disappoint a good guild.
---
Yup. Saw that too, posted on this thread a few months ago shortly after release. Want to say it was in RFK
---
Oh for sure. If love to have the frost sabre. I'm not a madman though.
---
I wouldn’t call getting a mount at 52 a flex lol
---
Two worlds though: gnome Rogue. 'nuff said
---
Someone do this and get us a R14 level 19. Not me though I'm too lazy.
---
reached 60, geared up, rerolled, reached 33 on new main, then freed up 5 gb of space on my ssd
---
You are totally right. Blizzard is so ignorant.
---
This was after BC though.  Vanilla and BC weren’t that bad on Illidan.  Heck, we had Warpath and several other major Alliance guilds.
---
Yeah most likely, lots of alliance refugees from Stalagg came over
---
Sheep breaks with damage and heals the person
---
Fear breaks after several seconds of being burned down by DoTs
---
Ehh 1 item per 4 mcs is about avg. Gear is slow in vanilla. Having said that, /rolling for gear is a horrible way to progress as a guild and you should seek out a LC guild asap, if you want to raid for the long term. If you just want gear for pvp DKP is the way to go.
---
My good man.
---
1.5 hours then.
---
I guess I am looking at this from the perspective that blizzard isn't the same company anymore. If the people up top, mainly Activision and investors decide this isn't up to snuff they will likely take action despite what Blizzard has said. When a company can call a game underperforming when it makes big sales numbers in its first week all because it didn't match what the last one did we can't trust them. Let's not forget that Bungie recently ran for the hills the second they could because of that exact type of scenario.
---
" would you work 1000 hours for $10?  no of course not.   it's perfectly  fine to inform people that certain actions yield less result than other  actions. "  
---
Go tell that to all those insane people in REAL LIFE who do things like... climb the mount  everest, dive into incredibly narrow caves they can barely  even fit, basejumpers.... just a few examples, most of them dont get ANYTHING for doing it... only a rare few, a waterdroplet in a lake, are doing it for youtube and money.  
---
It all depends on dedication... not reward. Some people actually enjoy doing something to the point it seems insane to "normal" people.
---
Like he said, dont tell other people what to do with their lives... nobody  likes that. 
---
Incase you didnt  realize...  there are probably thousands of people who do work 1000 hours and get nothing in return... musicians for example, only a few get record deals but yet many  do not. It applies to almost any hobby,  people dont do them for a reward... they do it for the satisfaction, even if it requires alot of work to perform. (cosplayers, charity workers, artists etc.)
---
Hopefully some of that is AFKing for que or something. I spent a lot of time jumping in inns.
---
Mine is Magni :D
---
And the potions sell for 10-15g per stack, you get a stacks worth every run. So it's closer to 35-45g per run. if you have it down with good gear you can do 3 runs an hour
---
Hey you should apply for this job that I’m a manager at. 
---
Everyone’s miserable, it somehow pays less than minimum wage (don’t ask) oh and customers are allowed to spit on you. 
---
How bout it champ, wanna apply?
---
You need to have your guild help you.
---
Stopped playing because of how boring Stalagg got. Could ride around for an hour and find maybe one alliance. I wouldn’t mind faction changes to the under represented faction at this point.
---
Worst part is, you wasted maybe 30 seconds of this guy's time (resurrection, buffs and heals) because the Graveyard is right next to the Horde hub. If you killed an Alliance player at the same distance from Morgan's Vigil, it would have taken them at least two minutes just to get to their body. The world design is really Horde-favoured like that.
---
Lmaooooo
---
Thought ranks are limited by level
---
Loss on them, they literally get nothing out of killing you.
---
Interesting, good to know.
---
Back in WotLK when I first started to WoW, I had a human priest with holy specced sitting on a tiger at lv 45. It is psychologically so much easier to grind when you are a fresh player I guess since the game has so much to throw at you.
---
You cannot for on a flight path, you will be taken to 1 hp and never drop below that even with dots.
---
I've never read anything confirming or denying that
---
I know of at least 6 rank 8s on alliance side, for horde I've only seen 2, but those 6 alliance have been the top 6 every week to my knowledge
---
I feel you there, phase 1 when the server was new and everyone was excitedly leveling was such an awesome feeling. It was a lot of fun then.
---
With phase 2 it’s a lot more challenging on a pvp server, I like pvp and can deal with it but I’m ready for the server to calm down with bgs at this point.
---
What do you guys do to reduce lag spikes without deleting add-ons and lowering graphics too much? 
---
In PvP and dungeons I get these huge 5s+ lag spikes where everything just freezes up.
---
Nah I don't like that line of thinking. The idea that change can never be for the better and is automatically going to make it like retail is wrong.
---
Is &lt;Leftovers&gt; a new guild by people who are "literally" leftovers on Flamelash?
---
This feels like the plot for Overlord
---
I am being killed every 10min at least while leveling as alliance. It is not really fun anymore, but I don't feel like doing this all again on a pve server.
---
https://gyazo.com/acbca2029431edd79aba64b1e6356af2
---
They grief them to stop playing, causing them to not get quests and resources for their side, 60s kill low levels so the low level same team can quest easier. No honor, but atleast your bois can level easy and farming zones are cleared.
---
Horde deserved what they done to others. Denial of game content.
---
So is that like a bzoomer?
---
The thing is, world pvp CAN be fun.
---
I usually run around in a gank squad of 5-10 people. When we find a similarly sized group, world pvp is a blast, we call targets, we help each other, we keep the enemy healers under control. Some battles, where we beat 7-8 horde as a group of five were great fun. 
---
The problem is, this fun aspect of world pvp happens maybe 5% of the time and even when it happens, it's not for long. Most of the time we either stomp groups of 1-3 or we get stomped by groups of 15-25. When we had a series of even fights, those groups soon band together to crush us with their weight of numbers.
---
Can't get past rank 5 without being 60
---
Yeeeeeah, about that. You see, Putting high pop PvE servers into groups with high pop PvP servers doesn't solve anything. The PvE players aren't going to queuing in high numbers, they're going to go into matches with battle hardened PvP players, and then decided that they don't particularly feel like being stomped on. It just means you wait three quarters of an hour for a match instead of an hour.
---
Aye its shite. Oh what's that, you're buffing wf? Warriors love tide
---
The game in it's current states breeds toxicity and asshole like behavior. BGs better fix this. I'm tired of basement dwellers killing me 5 times, with res sickness, just bc. Meanwhile all I wanted to do was leave TP and get to BS through brm to quest. Just kept dying. So dumb. 
---
Get a life gank squads....
---
lmfao the way blizzard handle classic is pretty pathetic. how the faction imbalance has gotten this bad is insane.
---
I only just got the message here. Thing is I don't really want to move to a different server.
---
Still very populated in capitals
---
I have 2 jobs and hit 60 way behind the curve, still 60 tho lmao. The game hasnt been out for a month, it's been out literally over 10 weeks longer than that. 
---
I like how I'm the asshole because I think the game is good and that people who care about the game are actually 60 after 14+ weeks. The guy who thinks the game is ruined because people try to be the best at it is actually a saint.
---
This server is depressing. Are there even any good guilds here? Everyone is a mega casual. Doubt I’ll make an alt here.
---
A lot of fury warripr bis items have + hit on them. If you are hitcapped, how useful is a say lionheart helm vs eye of rend? Also there are items without hit rating but other better stats or crit rating. Are they not better than the items with hit rating on bis lists.
---
Yeah kill their pet? How is it hard for real? Now what, mages are going to tell me their sheep can go off after only 20sec and hurr durr? 
---
With every CD up you, as a rogue, is a killing machine un a 1v1 situation. Heck you can even cheapshot to get combo pts and be able to stealth again.
---
How many time have you had your sap going off after a few secs? Because let me get it straight to you, my ice trap is getting resisted once every tree time on average. Can't count the amont of time an opponent get blindly into my trap only to have it resisted. 
---
Meanwhile your stuns doesn't even share a DR...
---
Grats! You are now winning at life.
---
It's not a long grind. I think I saw punkrat say it might take a week, and that's probably doing nothing but AV, but I definitely got to exalted on my first character before I knew how AV worked. It's an easy grind
---
Is there a free char transfer available for alliance or do we have to pay for this? Feels a bit odd having to pay to escape serieus server imbalance.
---
Shazzrah EU has the same population %, won't surprise me if we go next
---
Negative 3 already. fucking disgusting.
---
I’m not sure how accurate your link actually is. For example Pagle seems fairly consistent with other attempts to measure server pop but arugal (my server) is not 76/24 in favour of the horde. As an alliance player, it seems closer to 60/40
---
Imagine wanting an honorable kill so badly that you kill your server.
---
they look at 55 and 45 and think, hey these numbers are not far from each other. they are unable to comprehend that 10% percent difference means a 20% numerical advantage.
---
worse   
---
40:60. its both close to 50%. its still balanced...  
---
no it isn't. one faction outnumbers the other by 50%.
---
math, not even once
---
Multiboxing is allowed by Blizzard's rules. That's all there is to say on the matter.
---

---
Technically they aren't breaking any rules.
---
Man. I almost rolled on this server, only went to Gandling because Flamelash was lagging.
---
Dodged a bullet there.
---
A ton of people who had the goal of reaching even rank 11 are going to realize that it just takes so much time.
---
There's a reason why the honor system changed.
---
Nooooooooooooooo!!! I'm one of the few alliance left on that cursed server!
---
My server isn’t as bad as Herod but I’ve basically solo grinded 48-55 and made a ton of cash and it went fast but I haven’t played in a week cuz it wasn’t fun.  Would like to do some quests in gel wood or winter spring but that’s just not on the books lol.  It is what it is right?  Probably for the best I got to play outer worlds with the 1$ 3 months of Xbox pass
---
How the hell is having 10 mages spamming arcane explosion fair.
---
I'm okay with being behind all of those people. I know Trillax is a professional gamer. If he gets gear before me, so be it.
---
Nor mine.................nor mine
---
My 3v3 in TBC was my Paladin Holy/prot reck, arms warrior, and a mutilate rogue. Was such a fun combo super hard to kill, and you could nuke focus target fast.
---
&gt; you should think the \#nochanges players for this mess
---
And yet the one change is the problem. Hmm.
---
Find a guild with a looting system you prefer. Our's uses EPGP, a couple others do DKP. We stopped with /rolls after we didn't need pugs anymore, which was only the first time we did MC. I don't know of any guilds that do /roll.
---
I'm just saying, he said he doesn't care about karma, but he clearly values other peoples opinions by posting a flex post on Reddit.
---
&gt; Warlock - Good pvp caster with some utility/peeling with CC, also healthstones. Not many warlocks so easier to get groups n gear. My only concern is that nearly 50% of horde is undead, how much does WOTF screw you over as an alliance warlock?
---
To be honest, most rogues and warriors will tear you up regardless of side. I played a human warlock for a few years in vanilla and you just kind of learn to deal with it. It does feel worse this time around because everyone and their mother has a shadow reflector. With SL, you might stand a chance. 
---
I honestly wouldn't make a human warlock for PVP again.
---
Haha you are the archetypical horde stereo type its so fking cringe I cant believe it :D
---
Lovely 😊
---
Copy wtf and cache folders too. Should work.
---
Absolutely stunning!!
---
real wow players do not touch gurls, be gone, imposter
---
Nice wolf bud!
---
Obviously was supposed to say server, not side.
---
Thank you!
---
:3
---
Because if those people weren't allowed to transfer off, they'd quit. The result for the server is largely the same, except Blizzard loses the monthly $$$.
---
Please don't. There are already enough rogues on pvp servers.
---
Thank you! :D
---
6 hours is way too much. 2 hours at most. 6 hours in I'd say 10+ have cleared it.
---
I dont doubt that is true and retail and was true then. I certainly was a child when I played back then. However, classic has next to no children playing it
---
Is transfer still available from flamelash? Can't find it on account page.
---
Or you know, play when the kids in bed? Play *with* the kid?
---
Either way nobody cares. RL &gt; WoW, news at ten.
---
This is a great idea that is completely in the spirit of having the honorless debuff to begin with. I’d go even further to make it so you can’t be MC’d while honorless to make the duel exploit impossible as well.
---
True, but there's often enough. Only one person in the raid needs to have the program for everyone to count.
---
5 piece t1 is good... da fuck?
---
Easily resolved, set hearth to a location 5m away on a flightpath from IF.   When you hearth, you take that flight to IF, by the time you arrive, no flag.
---
Went from having 18 hours a day to play when I was younger to 2 hours a day now. Can't really play the exact same way, and it kind of sucks having to be efficient with my time instead of just having fun like I used to.
---
The game was great plenty of times after.
---
Eye of rend is pretty close in terms of pure dps if you have a lot of hit already. But as soon as you replace one of your items with a new shiny epic that might be lacking hit bringing you under cap, that lionheart is by far the best. And besides it will last you the entire game, so totally worth the investment 😄
---
r/unexpectedtool
---
Is server transfer still open?
---
Last night IF was epic. Around 9-10pm server time literally 3 or huge raid guilds lined up to show off. Hundreds of people in IF
---
You need to learn how to spell better
---
I'd rather sit in a 1 hour queue on a blanced server than being constantly farmed for honor on a terribly loop-sides unbalanced server.
---
But most private servers were at least balanced to a point where no faction had complete supremacy.
---
The private servers were just better managed all around (well, some of them were \#ripNost ) , and managed to actually play well with a server 3x the concurrent cap.
---
Until a big fooking vortex comes to tear it apart
---
I wasn't, but stay mad at something i guess
---
6 weeks of PvP every day for 4 hours? Something like that?
---
9gag, really?
---
Yeah, that's what I've been doing :( I just zip up the WTF and Interface folders and take them with me. I'm hoping for an automatic thing though. Dropbox-style sync would be ideal, but that is painful and finicky to setup outside of the Dropbox folder.
---
I find it quite ironic as all of the alliance I ran into on that server are hyper aggressive.
---
Why not just use the free transfer? That's what me and my friends did. We went to Bloodfang with less players but an even balance in A/H. It feels like a fresh new game.
---

---
I started crying about it 2 months ago, but everyone were busy cheating the game with constant layer abuse, and thus I was downvoted.
---
Its far better on medium pop servers.   Even if you're the minority faction, the fact there are 1/5th the people mean there will be safe places to go, especially at off hours.
---
I missed it too:( form a 2 man guild together?
---
Cute assumption.
---
as a fury orc warr, is it worth getting flurry axe as a casual gamer? Will my dps be a zillion times higher than say bone slicing hatchet? I realize it’s BiS but ”how BiS” is it? 😁 ty!
---
Great stuff, very interesting
---
DELETE
---
He’s not complaining about not being level 60. I’ve been playing very slowly too and I’m fine being low levelled. I’m fine being far, far from the best player. I’m playing the game to adventure in one of my favourite fictional worlds. I just want to have fun and meet people. 
---
For the most part, my experiences have been pretty positive but it sucks to be trapped on a server with people determined to burn through literally hundreds and hundreds of hours of content in a few of months who then complain that there’s ’nothing to do’ and gank people all day.
---
I’d argue that classic is far better suited to players who play slowly without trying to min max. Itemization is bad, class balance is bad; the game revolves around the social sandbox adventure elements and starts to wear thin when people try to be meticulously competitive. 
---
For people who need cutting edge competitive content and to perpetually have an objective handed to them by developers I’d think that retail raiding and daily quests would work better.
---
really? i transfered my ally 60 priest and 45 mage there, but since the server seemed dead back then, i cut my losses and rerolled horde to play with some other friends.
---
how is the ally raiding scene? faction balance? ah is active? if horde has 10min+ queue, i am going to consider playing these chars again.
---
&gt; To expect an entire server to micromanage itself from being douchebags is way to much for the wow playerbase imo
---
It's way too much for human beings in GENERAL man. Only reason real life is slightly better is because we have actual consequences to your actions in real life.
---
There will always be some low level players and alts playing. So overall 500 people shouldn't be that hard to accomplish.
---
sillithus north-east corner - the twilight acolytes
---
this is the single most remote area in the game for now, no other place is this far to the next questmob and there is just a single ore spawn and a single herb spawn close, and they're far enough that you have a chance of not being bothered even if someone from the other faction comes to gather them
---
the mobs drops silver, runecloth and 1 rep for cenarian expedition
---
Fuck TBC.
---
People are crying about the current state of vanilla, well its nothing compared to the trainwreck of an expansion that is TBC.
---
A friend of myself and I want to play alts due to the fact that PvP is currently unplayable and the "raid content" is finished within 2h per week.  
---
We wanna play classes that have high synergy effects between each other and between our Mains (he runs WL, myself a priest) speaking about PvP
---
Is the only choice Rogue/Druid or Warrior/Paladin or are there any other valiable combinations?
---
Playing Alliance.
---
[I would probably do this](https://i.imgur.com/Wo2aAzv.png)
---
I mean if you have such poor time management that you can’t pencil in 2 hours a week to raid then it’s probably a good thing. If you have been going hardcore since launch you should have more then enough gold and consumes to last a while. Heck if your in a raid guild that’s flasking your probably doing sub 2 hour mcs anyways. It’s not like your playing with your kid 24 hours a day 365.
---
But if it is based on such low chance it has nothing to do with skill.
---
BRM was so much fun last night on Comfyshaker
---
Yes I moved the last day free transfer was available. Bloodfang has a balance closer to 50/50 but the server pop is medium. Actually feels great.
---
if you are playing wow when your kids are awake its better that you quite, honestly.
---
First Brutality Blade drop waiting room. Also, please release BWL Q.Q
---
That's making the assumption that every horde was playing ultra aggressively. The top two brackets obviously were, but everyone else (myself included) was at least after the pvp trinket and the 10% discount.   
---
Bracket 1 players on Flamelash have been consistent in their ranking, we'll definitely have r14 players at the first possible opportunity.
---
The fuck? Assuming you have absolutely nothing else to do in life. Most people will never complete their blue set, let alone have the time to reach the higher brackets.
---
**NEXT STEP:** Breed alliance in laboratories and abort the fetuses for honor gain.
---
Whats that focus bar addon called? Thanks!
---
Twist: they'll ignore both and implement a solution that sucks for everyone.
---
Couldn't care less, there's no BG inside AQ.
---
So what you're saying is rogue is the epitome of skill applied per point of effort
---
you kidding? azshara is always my first destination when I start my ganking route and there is a lot of pray running around at all times
---
Could have cut 90% of this clip
---
Yes. Isn't it obvious?
---
That's what I tried to describe as *not* working in the post. It syncs *which* addons you have installed, but does nothing for the data or settings they maintain.
---
The real blame is on the players, its always been our fault, we shaped the game, we made it worse, cause we're toxic frustrated consumers, we forgot what fun is, ruining someone else'´s experience of the game is fun nowadays, putting ppl down is considered fun, cause we're just insecure little cunts, fuck the players, we are to blame, we failed.
---
Karma bitches. They literally killed PvP haha
---
So Darn is still empty
---
Congrats man! 
---
You’re playing wow how it’s meant to be played.
---
You definitely count the first nightfall proc here. The 20 sided die thing is misused as an analogy. This is rolling exactly a 20, not any number (actually 25 on a 25 sided die). You can assume rolling any other number is not a crit.
---
&gt;Props for putting family first
---
This fucking sub
---
WPvP can be very fun. It's just that now without the option of BGs, and most people are decked out in full PreBis PvE and PvP its about optimizing the best honor per hour. its no longer the occationally 1v2 or 1v1 in the world when people are questing, going to a dungeon or whatever. I think that a big factor is also the big server caps. The servers not being capped at 3-4k players makes it so there are big PvP grps in every zone.
---
I had exactly this problem. 
---
A guildie suggested body pulling with the pet instead of letting it attack anything, hasn’t been a problem since.
---
Coward LOL. You are insane
---
Fuck that, the raiding in TBC was some of the best the game had to offer. And 25-man raids were much more manageable.
---
It's the equivalent of giving a child a fun toy. They may play with the toy, care for it, find interesting uses for it. Or... they may trash it, burn it, smash it, and cease to be able to play with it anymore after destroying it.
---
I suppose you would blame the toy or the toy maker for not designing the toy better? The toy should force the child to play nice? No, the child should learn to think about the bigger picture. Does it want to have the toy in a month?
---
That was literally the worst thing about Cataclysm for me.  Deathwing messed up my favourite vanilla zone :(
---
Yes, that is how it works.
---
If I could move my PvP server characters to PvE I’ll resub.
---
And to add to this, it was a mage so he didn't die.
---
making kids is not something you toy with because your SO wanted a kid.
---
It seems to me not only you are not ready for a kid, you weren't even looking forward in having one in the first place.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Gz on being stuck and unhappy for the years to come.
---
Aaaaaand.... it’s gone
---
Either Blizzard mixes PVP and PVE servers in cross realm BG and it will be the a mess or Alliance from PVE servers will have fun with same queues or even larger since they are dominant on PVE servers.
---
Same thing here man. I got into WoW through Classic and was having a blast.
---
But I realized I started neglecting some thing and I had to stop. I have a problem when it comes to games and give it all my time and energy. This is a problem that’s best solved by just stop playing.
---
Yeah considering AV mount doesn't require riding skill and looks better than the normal ones, probably not ideal.
---
The first month or so was fun but in the last few weeks the last of my friends have left the game and I'm about to follow suit, it was a fun nostalgia trip but it's no fun when you're playing by yourself and just logging in for raids.
---
Have you tried Azeroth Summon Services?  It’s some multiboxer with like 10 lvl 20 locks in the most insane spots in BRM and DM. Dude will summon you seconds after you whisper and you just pay on arrival like 3g. Highly recommended
---
With 4 hours a day i think its closer to 8 weeks
---
Yeah, for average player the situation is horrid. P2 was botched. I don't understand one thing though, why so many players pvp in huge raids? Honor gain seems horrible that way. I was the minority in both ways that I did enjoy this phase and that I pvped solo mostly(some in 2-5 ppl groups), but that's only cause I am competetive, but I could still be that way while other don't have to suffer this P2, so it's a win for nobody, not for the horde who outnumbers and have to look for pvp long and boring, neither for alliance that can't make a step outside town without getting instantly ganked.
---
I got confused and now I'm listening to Hail Spirit Noir.
---
Started about two months ago. Generally play a few hours every other night and hit 54 as an Undead Warlock last night.
---
It's been fun. Enjoying questing. My realm is pretty much max population so PvP is completely mental and it's been hard to find zones to quest in but you can still find times where you're uninterrupted for an hour or two. 
---
I don't hate the PvP even though I'm not a max level and it's constantly 60's killing me. I enjoy the fact that I can actually fight back against most of them apart from Rogues. Were in retail (MoP and the one after were the last ones I played) a couple of levels was a mammoth difference. 
---
So far so good. Getting myself to 260 Tailoring has felt rewarding as I've made all my bags and gear myself. It's the little things I've been learning to enjoy which I think has made me really appreciate the game more.
---
&gt;Yall killed it
---
Sorry, only you can kill it for yourself.
---
WoW always had a meta, always - plugging your ears and going 'LA LA LA' isn't gonna change that. 2005 is never gonna roll around again, and enjoying the game is gonna be real hard until one realizes this.
---
Metas change and evolve, it's still the same game\*, but we're different.
---
Deal with it.
---
^(\*#nochanges) ^(but) ^(we've) ^(got) ^(what) ^(we've) ^(got.)
---
Second Wind isn't bis as well, since DM is out.
---
Is this a render or painting? Because holy crap those shadows are top dollar.
---
As of now it's literally a shit show, and people are leaving the game. Sure it sucks that some people would have to wait to play, but as of now lots of players are denied the ability to play since they're constantly griefed by the faction that has 3k+ more players online during peak hours.
---
PVE servers usually have their own established areas for PVP skirmishes, most of the time it's TM vs SS. You go in there to expect most of the people to be with pvp enabled so you enable yours.
---
I played only a few private servers. They all had their little issues. But it was okay to play on. I didnt play long, only grind to 60 and then mostly stop.
---
Classic fixxed a lot of the issues. It was fun playing. I started with a lot of friends. But its not the same like vanilla. This is due the fact, that I am not 15 years anymore and I know all of classic already. I thought this would not be a problem, but it became a problem more and more. For mostly all of my friends the grind to 60 was a race and the grind was to hard. (For their excuse i was rushing so hard and this maybe showed them a wrong way to play)
---
I was the first in my group to get to 60 (as a rogue). Then I played with a few friends I know over the internet, but thats not the same as playing with your longtime IRL friends. With some of them I already played vanilla and I know one of them only through Wow vanilla. But they all stopped. No one was there to play with me.
---
I think the thing for me is: when I was younger it was way easier to connect with random strangers, join a guild, hangout with them in the voicechat. Nowadays I dont need new friends, I like more to play with my dudes, I like to hangout with THEM in the voice chat, no matter what game we are playing. So I stopped too. Because I had no fun playing with strangers and the what am I grinding for? Playing alone World of Warcraft, grind the same items I grinded in vanilla?
---
My wish was to get to see Molten Core and Onyxia with all my mates in one raid. To show them where I had one of my best online times as a teen: going wild in a 40 man raid MC - where it was not about "who is dealing the most dmg". It was all about fun, group commuity, downing the next boss  - dont care how often we wiped. We had still fun in our class-channels in teamspeak.
---
I still had fun leveling to 60, meeting nice people. I bought a new month 2 days ago. I will play my rogue causaly, maybe a lot of fishing. Wanna grind an nightelf hunter just for fun when I am bored.
---
TLDR: I am old now. Wanna play with my RL friends - whom the grind was to hard. Cant grind same stuff as 10 years ago. But still had a blast leveling to 60 again.
---
This isn’t a new phenomena. People rarely think outside their own needs or what consequences they might have. This one is on Blizzard.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons
---
The moment I heard of the 6 phases I had an idea.
---
Logging in late august for the first time, realizing that even with layering this is WAAAAY too many people, and these fuckers will want to PvP on one layer, we're fucked.
---
So aye, I saw it coming. And i'm on a PvP server
---
Pretty hollow when there's nobody around to play with and you get ganked 10v1 every time you walk outside the command room.
---
Really? Night elf druids, human rogues, dwarf priests? Horde has good races too, but I don't think alliance is that disadvantaged.
---
**Tragedy of the commons**
---
The tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action. The theory originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known as a "common") in Great Britain and Ireland. The concept became widely known as the "tragedy of the commons" over a century later due to an article written by the American biologist and philosopher, Garrett Hardin in 1968. In this modern economic context, "commons" is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, roads and highways, or even an office refrigerator.
---
How do you see total auctions
---
What evidence besides your confirmation bias?
---
=ppppppppppppppp
---
Wish I could be playing WoW for the first Time, enjoy your stay. :)
---
Idd. People need to learn to use curse of recklessness to control them.
---
Gl with AQ.
---
And there are pve servers where you can escape it completely
---
The fact you can't understand why someone would ask for help sifting through unfiltered information goes a long way towards explaining why you believe an ancient human civilization was annihilated twelve thousand years ago.
---
Horde love to blame blizzard, maybe don't grief players and have a ounce of integrity. Do you really have to corpse camp that level 48? Do you really have to? They got what they deserved
---
Guilds will leave, and have been leaving in organized groups. Literally every major alliance guild on Flamelash just left today.
---
Damn I had a pretty bad time in Stranglethorn Vale back in September haha .
---
That's absolutely amazing! Get this to the FP!!
---
It doesn't matter what percentage he accords to either view. The reality is that a person's opinion isn't black or white but can be a gradation of ideas, opinions,.. A duality.
---
Your condemnation of this shows that you do not understand that this person both knows that the ones that left are likely in a better situation, while also wishing they'd stay in order to tough it out with the rest of them. Any normal person has this kind of opinion.
---
great weapon, but comparable? :S No.
---
&gt; There's a pack in lbrs that if los'd will do a back and forth pat a few times before coming over. One caster has to be aggroed and los'd be a second player or it just stands there.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Only instance of weird mob pathing that I've seen.
---
I've experienced this a few times myself.
---
"Horde 90/10 sergeant neckbeard why do you ask?
---
*goes to a seemingly middle of nowhere location to fish, still gets ganked 3v1*
---
The community on my wow realm is toxic af and disgust me. But the gameplay its basically like i imagined it to be.
---
&gt; In TBC Shaman tanks had this utility + some more. I loved to tank then as a Shaman, it felt like Blizz was going to make them real tanks in WOTLK. But the fuckers didnt but instead introduced the rogue tanks (Death knights) which were absurdly OP for the first 6 months.
---
&gt; If Shamans totem agro would have been added onto their threat and they had gotten a separate taunt, they would have been ok tanks.
---
Off-meta tanking in TBC is super easy, mostly because of the higher amount documentation at the time and the access to gems and also that horde have paladins. I've been testing this notion for years and it's crazy how soon off-meta tank specs can start tanking raids. 
---
The only tank in TBC that still remained to have some problems is
---
mage tank.
---
What changes later?
---
Axe's and Crit are very good for Warriors  
---
But Swords and the multiple attacks are a little bit stronger in my opinion.  
---
Still both are very good weapons, and OEB and BRE are just a bit better :)  
---
But how about you do a whirlwind Crit and a mortal strike crit, and the filthy alliance drops dead, gives a very good feeling :D
---
Good for you, takes a lot of strength to realize that and make a change.
---
Which server?
---
Lots of allys transferred to ten storms and it legit feels 50/50 right now, super healthy. Server economy is fucked though.
---
Let me guess, you're a horde player on a horde dominant realm?
---
That's why people are suggesting transfers and an imbalance tolerance of 55/45 or 60/40 as well to go with Q times. Guilds will organize transfers togethers it's happened since they first opened the ability in Vanilla.
---
We use a google sheet. One sheet on which we enter our name to which raids we will attend. A second one on which we see who gets accepted into the raid.
---
I'm curious about your server pop and it's PvP or not. I have never run into another multiboxer (I double box, but rarely in the same place; mostly play one character while tied up in something elsewhere) on Whitemane and I used to do herbal patrols all the time. Have certainly heard complaints about it though; maybe it's worse on PvE servers?
---
Get the pvp trinket
---
You knew what you were signing up for.
---
That way the mecha chicken can retrieve your body for the tauren to keep golfing with.
---
Nothing really, tbh.
---
Okzoomer
---
NOCHANGES
---
Makes cents.
---
Blizzard issued several warnings from people to transfer from overpopulated realms. Imbalanced realms got a faction based transfer. No clue which other means could be implemented in order to fix that. Faction-based queues are out of the question since it wasn't a thing in vanilla.
---
Titan panel shows it when you want. Not sure how accurate but anyways.
---
Why are you advertising this bro? We aren't capped, and youre welcoming more horde. Noooooo!
---
Buy +frost or +fire damage gear as you'll have water to keep your mana good. Fire gear is a lot cheaper and you can still aoe kill packs of humanoids with frost nova, flamestrike, maybe a blizzard and arcane explosion. Most people will get the +frost gear and spec full aoe grind mode which is doable but expensive. You can also pick up elixirs of firepower and get blast nova if you want to wreck in pvp. Frost is the slower and safer option though.
---
My favourite zone! Amazing work, followed!
---
Haha yes! In this particular run we got Jed too without fishing for it.
---
As for farming the reed I lost it twice to resto shamans  (both were guildies so i was fine with it) until a few of my friends just decided to do a few full ubrs clears and reserve it for me =)
---
Lol quit talking to yourself.
---
Welp, thank Christ I got the fuck out of there and I'm talking from the perspective of a horde player.
---
This was a thing but probably better to farm level 60s still. There will be an over supply of the eggs.
---
Fuck no, it's so much better than modern games.
---
Grinding exalted in classic wow: 
---
- Here's X/Y/Z activities that can grant rep. 
---
- Each one overlaps with another, separate, goal you have. 
---
- It will take about 150 hours to finish. 
---
- You choose which one you want to do and when you do it. 
---
- If you want to do 75 hours a week for two weeks that's perfectly fine, you do you.
---
- If you want to do 5 hours a week for 30 weeks that's perfectly fine, you do you.
---
- If you want to do 10 hours every saturday for 15 weeks that's perfectly fine, you do you.
---
- If you want to do alternating weeks, 30 hours one week, none the second, 30 hours the third, none the fourth etc that's perfectly fine, you do you.
---
- 150 hours is 150 hours, no matter your real life schedule.
---
Modern MMOs: 
---
- Here's one singular activity that grants rep.
---
- It does not overlap with anything else you need to do. 
---
- You have to go out of your way to do it. 
---
- You cannot progress with your guild until you've finished it.
---
- It will take you 30 minutes from start to finish. 
---
- You can only do it once per day.  
---
- You will need to do it across 30 days.
---
- If you log in and do it every single day it will take you 30 days.
---
- If you play 3 day a week, but can play for 10 hours those days it will take you 70 days to finish.
---
- If you play 1 day a week, it will take you over 180 days to finish.
---
- You want to catch up for the days you missed? Hah! get fucked, fucker, should've played exactly how we told you to. 
---
- But don't worry, the content that's gated behind that chore will only be relevant for 2 months. Once it's empty and there's no reason to ever go there, we'll remove the requirement outright. Fuck you if you wanted to actually do it but couldn't or wouldn't conform to our exact schedule.
---
I generally trust faction ratios but take population numbers from ironforge.pro with a big grain of salt. The data is based on: 1. guilds that raid and can field a full roster (partial pug or full pugs rarely bother with WarcraftLogs); 2. raiding guilds who upload data to WarcraftLogs. I wouldn't be surprised actual population number is at least 3-5x higher.
---
Reputation gains were doubled by then just for the record. Not raining on your parade or anything just providing clarity for people reading and thinking getting exalted with another race by 45 is feasible
---
I just rerolled to a less populated pve server.  You don't need 6000 people at the start of launch date to find groups. There are ample P2 refugees leveling, and maxed people leveling alts. I have 0 trouble finding groups. 
---
If you don't wanna reroll then don't.  But don't complain about getting ganked 24/7. That's the issue. Blizzard isn't going to do anything to fix the problem, so the only person who can fix it, is yourself. 
---
I've got like 30 days played on 3 different toons, but I wasn't enjoyed getting camped so I didn't something about it and moved. I still have those toons if I want to play on them. 
---
And you can still reroll and stay in touch with those people, discord exists for exactly that reason.
---
w h o l e s o m e
---
Enjoyed reading that. Thanks for posting!
---
If they're in distance of seeing you stealthed they can see the pet. But further than melee range they can't. Sometimes this helps them unless you're sprinting in. Mages just arcane explode if they see it.
---
I eventually stopped caring because the royal seal of eldre'thelas for warlocks is only 6 sp less
---
Mine is Vicarius!
---
Nope it's pretty close to even balance, always people ganking from Horde @ BRM and other usual spots, sometimes its the other way around aswell.
---
no, you obviously cannot read very well. Alliance have been whining about this since Phase 2 was released, yet here we have 5 alliance doing the exact same.  I'm laughing at the hypocrisy, but obviously you were too stupid to realise that.
---
Well prime time hours are prime time hours because that's when people have time to play... y'know because they have jobs... and school...
---
If you work in a field where having "1+1=50" is better than nothing at all, I want to know what you do exactly. Especially in statistics, having wildly incorrect figures is equal to, or worse than, having none at all because the conclusions you're going to draw are worthless.
---
This is perfectly shown here in this scenario since the data presented here simply is so incorrect that it's not even worth looking at. What kind of conclusion are you going to draw? Look at Ten Storms.
---
What kind of conclusions can you draw from this 100% incorrect data that is worth anything?
---
1. That the server has no horde at all. No horde players whatsoever.
---
My guess, without data, would be that there are some alliance and some horde players. My completely made up guess without any sort of data behind it whatsoever is more accurate than what's presented.
---
For someone else making a judgement on how the server balance looks like in deciding what to play and where, not having access to this 100% false data is a lot better than looking at it.
---
Yeah, all that free money, cocaine and strippers sure takes it toll on those poor slave investment banker drones.
---
[Get Perpendicular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb_PyKuI7II)
---
We sign up on discord, i think its a bot of sorts but i m a discord noob. I ll have a look when i get home cause i dont think i can tell from the app.
---
Pretty meh... updated talents, better itemization, blizzard watering stuff down in ways they shouldn't, but then also not modifying things they should.
---
The world pvp is a joke right now, the botting is horrendous, blizzard just seems like it has barely any staff on classic and don't care all that much.
---
I had a dude tell me about it the night before classics release and i thought he had some good point but was being a bit of a sook about it.
---
That being said. I was keen for the death and roaming gank squads and that element of it being hardmode. Thats what i like though and from reddit i guess it is not for everyone. I am more upset of the lack of alliance goon squads or much participation at all. I thought playing horde i would be the underdog. 
---
Leveling i barely had any alliance come gank me and even on my alts i barely have any world pvp. Worst i had was at lvl 40 on an alt i got corpse camped for like an hr which was fun trying to get away from this mini goon squad. 
---
Im leveling an alliance alt on a horde skewed "mega" server and I havent had much trouble in terms of the game being unplayable at this point though. So i think there might be some hyperbole on reddit. Might change when i hit endgame on him.
---
you should have rolled on a pve server kiddo
---
You can rank 1 frostbolt the resist mob and still be good. Your shield might break a little more often but it was going to do that anyway.
---
Ahh yes horde being number 1 all is right in the world.
---
It's against the rules, but only matters if you get obnoxious with it and you get reported by a large number of people.
---
I'm horde on Mograine and I get killed quite a lot nu Alliance. You hold Feralas for a good amount of time, TP has been held too and BRM is sometimes held by horde, other times by alliance
---
You're also nigh-unkillable if played right. I enjoy pissing people off with the whole "nope-still alive, try again angle". They also get very impactful cooldowns.
---
We use a shaman to MT Geddon and off tank adds on several other bosses. Even had them tank Rag for part of our first kill as a guild!
---
Can you give me a good example then on what sort of useful metrics you get from looking at this data.
---
Give me the control metrics you'd use to compensate for the fact that every piece of information you are looking at is completely false in one way or another. Specifically look at Pyrewood Village, looking like a deserted server, or Ten Storms having no horde players at all.
---
What kind of measures would you use, specifically, to be able to draw any kind of correct conclusion from the data you're looking at?
---
&gt; Well do you think it's a coincidence that PvP servers are ALL horde dominated?
---
According to the available data, they are not. The rest of your comment is overtrivialized hyperbole.
---
&gt; Though I doubt that you are actually interested in having any sort of constructive discussion or potentially changing your mind.
---
I am actually interested in seeing some proof of your opinions.
---
Up to you pick a guild that does loot how you like. It's going to take a long time to get fully geared no matter what. I think most guilds usually run about 4 priests so every time a piece of priest gear drops your going to be rolling against less and less people.
---
If you want to leave it should be because you want a guild with a different loot system not because you raided for 3 weeks and got no gear because that can and will happen with any loot system.
---
He gave an infinite amount more information about the realm than you did.
---
I did this back in vanilla. Bought up all small eggs and sold them for 1g each. Made a fortune.
---
I'll take that as a yes.
---
Sure, but the "reckoning build" is where you spec into it to build stacks from sitting down.
---
Yes you are correct to a point the +5 axe means you dont have to focus on hit but you are thinking of a pure dps perspective. Troll is considered better for tanking because of the Hp regen and the berserk racial for threat. But like i stated before you are min/maxing and honestly the racials are minimal for pve compared to pvp. I have seen trolls out dps orcs just like i have seen undead tank better than trolls and taurens. i was simply giving something very brief for a new person.
---
This 😅👌
---
SS?
---
Fashioncraft, gnomes look really dumb. Srry for casual racism but gnomes are trash
---
Census on the server done right after the mass exodus showed 151 Alliance online compared to the 1.5k horde online. Doesn't look like they'll have the 500 people pvping to reach it,
---
Jokes on the one migrating to play with a "top world guild" I guess :P
---
My guild uses the Discord bot and it works real well. The leaders go through it a day before raid and pm the guys that didn’t apply or signup / announced vacancy. They do this both to make sure people actually signup and also so that they can announce to the socials of the guild that’s they can join and start filling up the raid. 
---
It’s convenient since people usually have disc on there phones and can answer messages and get notifications. But I mean if people don’t take it seriously or don’t want to, you still might have the same issue. At the end of it all, the system of signup is just a part actually signing up.
---
Dude I hear you! i was definitely leaning towards PvE...coming from a PvP server it just does not fit my casual game play. What server are you on? and how is the state of it?
---
I just don't get ppl who say "Ruin".
---
Wtf they were supposed to do if they like Horde? Spend another 12 months leveling a character from the faction they DON'T want to play?
---
This reminds me of doom of Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning. It died because it was mainly PVP game and obviously bad guys there are more badasss looking (Who doesn't like Orks?) so Destro was completely dominating Order and by the end of game's life Destro was controlling even the  outskirts of Order's capital (Technically lore canon).
---
So why ppl join Horde in the first place? There are many reasons and BLIZZARD are the ones responsible for this and not the players.
---
I'm not a pvper but for me, it's how boring Alliance races are. Just human after human who are seen as completely good, no flaws and just chads. If I played Warhammer I would definitely have a human char at some point and not just one but in WoW... whats the point of creating a HUMAN who is by lore can easily beat giants, orcs, ogres and other OP things. It's like creating an orc but it just looks worse lold.
---
I use git + wowman.
---
I push WTF + addon list.
---
Shutzstaffel. I mean Screenshot
---
To get your bars to look the same, pick the question mark picture in the macro options and use:
---
#showtooltip [ability here]
---
and then fill in the rest of your macro.  For example, if you wanted a macro that would switch to defensive stance and perform a sunder with one button push:
---
#showtooltip Sunder Armor
---
/cast Defensive Stance
---
/cast Sunder Armor
---
/startattack
---
It was the worst server EU. It's the only one with an imbalance that big and still high af pop. It was a literal unplayable nightmare for ally players.
---
Use some kind of cloud storage synced folder like dropbox or something and set up both computers to sync your interface and WTF folders.
---
I get where you are coming from, but in case i want to flag my self as a dirty pvp whore....I would love an equal fight/population. Just trying to play it safe and find a server that I can call home.
---
T1 isn't very good is not true. T8 bonus isn't very good would be the correct statement. Holy Crit talent, Crit tier set bonus, benediction crit bonus, crit bonus from int stat. Very very good overall. They give a lot of intellect. Unbuffed my Priest almost at 7K mana with a decent crit chance and plenty of HP making it viable for PvE and PvP.
---
&gt; Shoot man I’ve seen warlock tanks
---
I found this recently http://classicwow.live/guides/718/caperfin-s-advanced-warlock-raid-tank-guide
---
Wow looks like you got told :P
---
If your in a 10man group your not there for honor, your there for some weird sence of zerg satisfaction. 
---
When i pvp its for the honor grind. And most honor is gained when solo ganking.
---
Daaamn. I was gonna reactivate my subscription today for playing over the Xmas holidays with my old friends. just as I told them, they said don't, as they all transfered away and i am not going to start leveling all over again. I left partly due to frustration with getting ganked from countless hordes while leveling and decided to wait out till they're outleveld...
---
Blizzard, you've trapped us there. Why not open alliance only transfers to at least keep the players subsribed?
---
As long as the population is close to 50:50 limit it to whichever faction is currently higher. if you fuck it up, at least have the decency to just enable the smaller faction who cant play anymorr to flee and still play theier characters.
---
Lmfao you’re a horrible person
---
He literally does this all day every day. Anytime I see a high traffic thread talking about imbalance on PvP servers he's in there spouting off.
---
People are absolutely more volatile that they use to be.  It’s like most players are what use to be the 5% douchebag minority. 
---
Idk what it is but it sucks. 
---
I did notice PvE servers have much nicer players.
---
just do what we did on Flamelash EU, camp every alliance player untill they all leave the server, now it's basically a PVe server :)
---
strange that you dont find a guild that plays in the evening?  I have two kids aged 6 &amp; 8, and dont play at all till they are in bed. I quit back when Cata came out as my oldest was just born.  I raid 3 times a week (well Ony every 5 days, and MC once a week). But our guild dont start raiding till 7.30pm (Uk time), which is perfect for me. 
---
I sometimes squeeze in a few other nights play for a couple of hours, to farm or level alts, but I wouldnt play wow at all when the kids are awake, as we have loads of other stuff to do and play with them. 
---
Back in vanilla, TBC and Wrath, I was a hard core raider, playing wow 5-6hrs on week days, and 8+ hrs a day on weekends.  But I now prioritize family over video games, but still love playing wow when I can.
---
I really hope you enjoy your time with the kids, and even maybe find time to play a bit of wow when you get a chance. good luck to you man.
---
Why did you cock suckers downvote this VALID criticism?
---
You LIKE restrictions? You WANT to pay more for less?
---
Idiots.
---
The highest ranking player will always get 13001 RP Brackets 1-14 are playerpool dependant
---
The 200 people camping FP is not the majority on a 7000+ horde player server. You're yelling at the wrong people.
---
TBC pservers run on the 2.4.3 client. Fear Ward is nerfed (3 min with 3 min cooldown though it can be used in Shadowform) and available to all races. 
---
So if Blizzard cheaps out and just gives players the final optimized version like they did with Classic that's not great for dwarf (and draenei) priests.
---
The point is that they decided to use the word cowards to describe people who just didn't want to put up with the horrible situation as an Alliance on Flamelash. Insulting people due to them not being happy with the gameplay being offered in that server means that he is salty towards them, and he fails to acknowledge it. 
---
He tries to act as if it's okay, when deep down, he considers people who don't like the game the way he does, to be cowards. His post would be so much more respectful, had he decided to not directly insult the people who wanted a way out of this server. A duality is acceptable, being a dick though is something I like to call out on occassion.
---
Not going to happen now is it!
---
The discord bot works perfect for us; raid attendance is high and our only rule is a dkp penalty for those that sign up but don't show up.
---
Try gse addon
---
They brought it upon themselves to be honest. No one forced the horde to play like they did.
---
They played like massive dicks and now we either have an alliance majority on a server or no alliance at all.
---
So, may the horde never find someone in open pvp again and may they enjoy their 30-40 minute queue timer for BGs. 
---
Completely deserved.
---
we both know you won't be taking anything
---
I've come to realize this too. A lot of "toxic" campers in pvp hot zones such as Searing Gorge, are mostly there for honor points. The lack of BGs means they need to acquire honor somehow and it ultimately falls onto the unfortunately random players on their way to a dungeon or trying to finish quests to become the resource farmed by players who want honor points. 
---
Honor system without BG was awful *and* monotonous. The only reason they weren't released together was because of the idiots who spammed #nochanges *ad nauseam*. Sadly it has done irreversible damage already since some have opted to quit due to the "PvP" chaos.
---
In org I'm often attacked as an honourless target and the buff never fades either. They're idiots, especially when they're wiped by the army of hoard waiting for them.
---
It's fine.  They'll find out when every transfers off the server and it becomes a PvE server for Horde.
---
&gt; Shaman tanks, with proper gearing, can tank up to and MAYBE including UBRS.
---
Shaman are more than capable of tanking raids. Whether, it be off-tank or main-tank.
---
Happy to answer questions, I've raided t'ill Naxx.
---
*of early December 2019
---
By the time Christmas comes BGs are out and they're cross-server.
---
I mean, you could just become a normal player not a try hard. There's literally no fucking need to flask in MC or anywhere but Naxx for a few bosses. A better victory is to control yourself than to give up. Learn discipline to not be a try hard no lifer and just play the game normally. 
---
You can still raid. Use your skill to top the meters not excessive consumables.
---
What energy timer do you use? Struggled to find one that looks good
---
So Thats why Eartshaker is getting so populated, I didn't play for a week and when I came back there are people everywhere. IF is actually crowded. I liked playing on a medium pop realm, but I guess a full realm is fun too.
---
Im alliance, on a horde dominated server(Razorgore EU). And im rank 7 atm. 
---
Been averageing around 100k-150k honor per week.  Standing 35-50. 
---
Are you projecting yourself with your assumptions? Hows your grind going?
---
This is not true. 
---
They drop loot when you have the quest :)
---
lol your dreams are going to shatter when BGs release
---
I will take a look. thx
---
Would you kindly explain what the issue is with multiboxers? I mean, how do they interfere with you? Since they pay both for the game and a sub for each character, I don’t see how this is a problem. 
---
I mainly think that multiboxers are people selling accounts. Of course there’s exceptions.
---
So these drop loot only when you have the quest for there "burning something" drop.
---
That sounds great good move
---
Its a shame, in hindsight I'd rather have my economy fucked from layering than having my server gutted by imbalanced ratio because blizzard had no intention of regulating server population as they were coming up.
---
I just did.
---
By the end of vanilla I had about 200 days played between 4x 60s. Vanilla to bc launch was close to 800 days so that is around about 25% or all time (or average 6hrs a day) as a single uni student with part time job and a lot of free time 
---
In classic I have a lvl 46 with about 4 or so days played which is about 4% if we just ticked over 100 days... 
---
Life changes I guess!
---
I just finished my Darnassus rep on my warrior, now I have to regrind the money for the mount!
---
If it was so fun why not reroll on a PVE server? Wasted time isn't really an argument if you're having fun, that's why we play after all.
---
In any case, I'd say you coule give it another go in a months time on the PVP server, it will get better for sure.
---
In happy for you bro. If you cant balance both you made right choice. I have oneyear old and my wow time is limited, so i cant be competative raider, What I do in classic is leveling. I hit 60 in main warr and for most part im lvling alts now. bueatiful thing about is that I can alt+f4 or afk any time. I have been in MC raid only once and that was only to help guild to kill 1 boss ( one before rag) But i dont mind, since classic isnt going anywhere, but If i would focus on wow i could miss my kids first steps or notice small things that change his character. I will raid when my kid will be in kindergarden.
---
Report spam them.
---
They will never do this. And If the situation is wpvp, bg's will fix azeroth being the purge
---
They can tank all instances and raids.... just wont be first choice most of the time. But if you put in time and effort you can for sure find a spot. 
---
There are guilds on my server actively recruiting feral tanks for off tanks.
---
Some bis  are only bis because of other bis. With BWL onwards, ppl need to know thier classes because it is perfectly possible to not get full bis lists.
---
I'm on Nethergade Keep, sadly they're all (in EU) pretty unbalanced favoring the alliance
---
He fished and sold them, capitalized on times certain fish prices were inflated. I see how how he made 700g if you’d fished a ton of oil blackmouth before phase two was announced you’d make a killing.
---
There's also a setting that i think is turned on by default called "clear data after raid boss" or something. You want to turn that off if you want everything to sum up.
---
The dirty little secret about WOW is that other than Naxx and late AQ40, vanilla raids actually were 25 man. You really don't need that many people if they get 60fps and don't blow.
---
This is amazing!!! Your Northshire art is currently my phones wallpaper. Might be time for a change!
---
There's no. You could only see ranking of other people by inspecting them and it require for you to be in close vicinity.
---
It is boring. Rather do actual content.
---
And now all those Horde can play on a PvE server.  lmao
---
and what will that accomplish? multiboxers are flagged as such and reports are ignored
---
People have these weird memories of things happening.
---
The draw distance for Nostalrius was AWFUL and everyone complained about that, and the massive lag that happened everytime there was more than 10k people online.
---
Yet people keep pointing to Nostalrius as the gold standard when it actually had a lot of problems.
---

---
First time ever playing so didn’t go in with much expectations. Leveling to 60 was a lot of fun and addicting. Doing dungeons as a tank at 60 was really fun and rewarding. Finding a guild that I enjoyed has been quite pleasant. Doing end game raids ya been really fun and satisfying. 
---
Phase 2 pvp has been really annoying and has gotten me to the point where I almost avoid traveling to anywhere during buy hours that the enemy faction camps. Getting killed by the one off mage in p1 was annoying but most just went on their business. Now if I run into a mage or another party of 3 I know im about to go for a 7 minute corpse run. Detracts from the experience a bit. But hey that’s life I guess since I decided to play on a PvP server.
---
Everybody was saying that Honor system is flawed and encourages, ironically, the most dishonorable way of farming it as the most efficient, it also includes account sharing at high ranks and bg dodges, yet it was implemented as it was back then - therefore we will get used to it and sometimes enjoy.
---
There was no alternative to this system, period.
---
Also quit beeching alliance
---
and limit the number of transfers.
---
Why is yelling while stealthier against the rules? What? haha
---
People can’t scream when they’re in stealth in this world ?
---
Maybe not any change ever but certainly any change that sacrifices game play and community for subscriptions. I played from classic to retail, the game changed for the worse because it focused on subscriptions more than game play. I'm sorry but selling out is just a bad idea for this specific title.
---
&gt;Time to allow transfers, or force them.
---
"wE wAnT tHe ReAl vAnIlLa ExPeRiEnCe", oh wait there's incredibly unbalanced servers? TIME TO FORCE BLIZZARD TO IMPLEMENT QOL CHANGES.
---
This, he hasn't even hit the part that people are complaining about.
---
Paying for gold is against ToS so forget that. If Blizzard made the market pay-to-win by adding obtainable gear by buying it for money, it’s sure “ok” by me. It would ruin most of the game and it’s purpose  but it’s still a choice they made. 
---
I can see where you going and a totally agree with you that multiboxers have a huge power advantage. But they still pay for the advantage and Blizzard has never banned anyone for multiboxing. Since it’s not interfering with ToS. 
---
But I still wonder how it effects YOU if someone else is multiboxing? The only thing I can come up with if you get ganked by one.
---
Disable all addons, if lag spikes disappear - then addons are to blame.  
---
If not, then it's your ISP.  
---
Then you enable addons and check for lags.
---
Good. They wouldn't have kept playing this game anyway, if this already drives them off.
---

Easier to find a server
---
It feels like first weeks of people reaching 60. Like 10 alliance raiding guilds, including ours migrated there from flamelash.
---
NGL this is one of the reasons I don't plan on having children. My sister has kids, my brother has kids, many of my old gaming buddies have kids etc. and watching them having to prioritize their little snotgoblins above all else fills me with dread.  
---
Good on those of you for whom this is something that you want, but it's not for me.
---
The first step to enjoy classic the way you want is to leave this sub reddit. In game people with this try hard mentality are more prevalent than back then but it's not a majority. 
---
Plus you won't find many people backing up your point here, since you are talking to the most try hard.
---
Don't fatigue yourself replying to those people it's a waist of time and energy, most of them wont provide any argumentation unless it's an overused meme. 
---
Like it has been stated, they are community that share your vision, you just have to take the time to find them.
---
Tbf Heavy doesn't have particular traits that makes him more tanky (other than a larger HP pool) and class roles aren't as clear compared to Overwatch where the Tank/Heal/Damage roles are strictly defined. Although the lack of people wanting to play Medic was definitely observable. My highest playtime was on Medic because I often had to be the only Medic on the team to stop us from losing.
---
just use normal stealth after blinding ...

Every one of these NA PvP realms is reading Medium, meaning a high population in game and medium to no queues. These are all good bets.

---
Hyperbolic? Maybe you should do a little of your OWN research before you start being insulting. You claim to be 'open' to seeing proof. Well there you go. Pure numbers. 43 percent ally to 57 horde overall on PvP servers. Are you gonna continue to toss out insults or do you have anything useful to contribute to this topic?
---
What professions do you have?  With the Darkmoon faire coming soon, a great way to farm for gold is to make Rugged leather kits if you are a skinner &amp; LWer. As someone advised below, the Yetis in Winterspring drop this and are easy to kill, also, there are normally others there killing yetis for the quests so you can skin loads.  I did this back in vanilla and made a fortune selling these, especially for the 1st 2-3 DMF's as people are still looking for good epic upgrades.  
---
A rugged Leather kit only cost 5 RL to make, and when the DMF is in town, you can sell for 3-5g. Folk only have a limited time to access the vendors per month, so will buy the thngs needed to hand in, especially in the 1st arrival of the faire.
---
It's on heartseeker, meme server.
---
/roll sucks because it forces everyone to always roll on their class loot, fuck or anything they can possibly use, even if it's not a good upgrade. 
---
At least with LC or EPGP loot gets distributed somewhat evenly.
---
Man they should rename Wow Classic to something like Warcraft: The Horde Chronicles and make an alternate lore on how alliance became an endangered species and the Horde trying to keep them from extinction.
---
Is this because glancing blows cap out at +8 weapon skill so the +2 weapon skill on the edgemasters over the others to further reduce glancing and +hit are better than the increase in ap + crit?  Pretty crazy that 2 weapon skill past the 305 mark is still that much better.  Glad I got a pair of edgies.
---
&gt;Open up faction changes and then set limits for balance.
---
 "wE wAnT tHe ReAl vAnIlLa ExPeRiEnCe" lmao, it took 3 months for you to start bitching about unfair balance. This is what you asked for.
---
Hit level 60 alliance on a pvp server. Then you’ve accomplished something. PVE 60s don’t count.
---
I would say either spam dungeons or find a cave and grind mobs deep inside that cave😁
---
His guild name is overkill which is pretty appropriate for what happened there.
---
if you get a perd blade before your daggers rogues then your guild is evil.
---
True until lvl 25-30 for new players.
---
150 hours (my average time to 60) of grind/quest still is a bit long to access end game and will probably bore most when reaching lvl 50+
---
after backpedaling and buffing I stopped to watch
---
You assume pve holds any interest.  That's like me saying you can at least play the ah.  If the main draw of the game had been removed for you, whatever the reason the game looses it's appeal.  My horde server has 98% majority now.  The time sunk into those chars is wasted, same as for many Ali players.  Big server imbalances hurt both factions, that's fact.
---
&gt; This is what you asked for.
---
Is it?
---
Weird because I don't remember saying anything about classic before August 24th.
---
Stop projecting.
---
I tried dungeons even respected to holy for it but I land at the flight path and get killed took me 30 mins to get to the mountain for brd cause every time i spawned a horde on a epic mount came and killed me lol!
---
No, you absolutely can't blame blizzard for doing exactly what the community has been fighting and crying for the last few years. This is **exactly** what the real vanilla experience was. Stop bitching now that we have it.
---
Yes, sure there is major overlap.
---
But a 1337 pro edge-lord will almost always roll undead.
---
It won't.
---
Good thing those classes aren't comparable to say, warriors or mages.
---
&gt; I guess I am looking at this from the perspective that blizzard isn't the same company anymore. If the people up top, mainly Activision and investors decide this isn't up to snuff they will likely take action despite what Blizzard has said.
---
Sort of I get that but I don't even think its financially beneficial to start changing classic. The man hours required would really go against their desire to maximize profits. It took them forever to update classic wow they won't want to higher more GM's and Devs to make server merges a thing and shards. Personally I don't think Bungie has made any good games for maybe 10 years? Its hard to take them seriously when they have been in a drought themselves. Bungie seriously sold out when making the first Destiny and the second one with Blizzard was actually an improvement.
---
That's amazing, my only wish would be that this was a 4k wallpaper :)
---
This would have been a good idea IMO especially at the start to try and create healthy servers.  Im sure people would be up in arms because they would have issues with getting their entire guild on the same server though.  Most likely it would have been better for long term health of the game though since people would have been unlikely to quit over that and still been ridiculously hyped, and then the situation of 80/20 servers like now wouldn't have happened.
---
What would you say the faction balance is at atm?
---
 Ignorantia juris non excusat
---
How does one set up this type of discord bot?
---
so too late?
---
102 hours with 7 kills. My Rng sucks
---
still 800/900g to go for the epic mount at 60 though.
---
All dots proc effects only on first tick.
---
&gt;Is there a free char transfer available for alliance or do we have to pay for this? Feels a bit odd having to pay to escape serieus server imbalance.
---
Lmao, go back to retail kid, there's no "character transfers" at all, you're going to have to level a new toon.
---
You just can't help yourself, can you. Have to jump in with the absolute zero temperature takes.
---
How is the faction balance now?
---
I am afraid so.
---
There was less population, but also better balance. Why? Because a lot of people were picking a character they liked, instead of minmaxing every little stat. When the PvP patch dropped, WoW was still really fresh and by the time people figured out how the PvP system worked, BGs had dropped so things didn't have the time to get this bad.
---
15 years of knowledge and analysis + a completely broken PvP system that rewards players for bullying on a massive scale... Yeah, no wonder this happened.
---
Just kill mobs until you reach a high enough level for a new zone. Pirates are good because of the high mob density. You can also run zul farrak a ton and get to 48-49 off of that.
---
You as in the community, if you don't like it you can go back to retail.
---
g O tO R e T a iL
---
Would strongly recommend bagnon add-on, condenses your bags into one panel! Very nice
---
Look at Golemagg across the last 7 days - this isn't a good set of data.
---
Boring. Alliance is doing the same, especially on mograine. If you weren't lining up in front of a fortune teller you would know
---
This sounds like a very fun grind. Hope you had a great time.
---
You assume pve hold any appeal.  I cld as easily say minority factions can still play the ah in a cap city so it's all fine.  A large parge of why you rolled that char has been removed.  It is no different for my hours char.  98% faction imbalance and now mas exodus.  Dead realms are utter shit to play on, seen it in retail.
---
Never left it in the first place
---
Sorry, alliance transferred somewhere where they can be dominating faction themselves.
---
Also to note that overpopulation is a real thing.
---
Well if people are hoarding, then fewer will roll for the more regular drops?
---
I really wanted to clear ZF but it seems super hard to find group as rogue, people only want warrior/sham cleave and mages seems like...
---
&gt; when in reality Alliance is doing the same thing on the very few Alliance dominated servers...
---
What alliance dominated servers?
---
Oh no :(((  F
---
Nope BG where planned in P3 with BWL, so maybe check your Intel before stating wrong things.
---
I don’t get what you mean. His logs are fine meaning him losing threat to rogues and warriors are not an issue? I have trouble understanding the logs to see how well I hold threat when I tank.
---
MMO is more than just faction balance.
---
Not rlyy hard to find with how bad this one is
---
Yea, im not even remotely popular enough for that, hah
---
This is the reason why I picked PvE. Sure, world pvp is nice and all, but this is a huge problem on pvp-servers. Especially when they made the servers way bigger than Vanilla. I’m fine with rolling non-pvp while leveling and when I’m 60, I can always turn on pvp. And BGs are way fun for me so. 
---
For your problem however, I would say: never quest alone. 
---
Find a party member or two and quest together. People on pvp-servers are much more open to that than on pve. Or like another said, mob-grinding in a cave or way outside of quest-areas. Instance-leveling is a thing to, but as you said, it usually takes time to get there. 
---
This is a problem many people warned about going into p2 of Classic and being casual. Rolling pvp-server initially forced you to sing 60 before the honorsystem what implemented.
---
200iq faction selection;)
---
Yup that's basically : Everything is squishy, Sulfuron is a bitch.
---
I personally don't camp zones or even PvP despite being on an unbalanced PvP server (Skeram).  If alliance attack me I defend myself but otherwise I do a /wave or /cheer and ride on.  That being said ... I still die quite a bit since I suck at defending myself.  I do much better on my alliance alt on Incendius.
---
 /wooosh
---
And it only took you 7 years and 2 years of your kids life to realize! Wow, what a great family man.
---
Join EPGP-guild.  
---
Since every week there's 20% decrease in points, it's never too late to join this system.
---
Thats my rule aswell. No gaming while kids are awake. I cant even remotely imagine putting myself in OPs position, but ill give him credits for finding out of it by himself.
---
Tryhard? You didnt try at all.
---
Train your kid to grind consumes for you, make him watch you own in pvp and top meters. Be a rolemodel for gods sake.
---
You can get to 60 by questing. If you're unsure where to go, you can check guides or routes, the one I've been using for alts is classicwow.live/leveling. You can enter your level and it'll pick up right there.
---
Otherwise, if you really need exp and don't want to use a guide or just grind, do some dungeons! At that level, ZF in Tanaris would be good.
---
Pve is the majority of the Vanilla content your comparison is ridiculous. You at least have the option to do pve on the server you can still Q for your cross-server BGs you can still play your toon. The Alliance on that server now can literally log in to get ganked in their capital, and thats roughly it. They don't even have a large enough population pool to hit r14 in pvp if a few try hard alliance decided to stay. You're acting like your some victim when you still have some options while other people have no options.
---
It's like your complaining you don't have enough money for a new game while the person next to you doesn't have enough money to feed himself, and then you think your position is as bad as theirs.
---
That makes no sense though. If people are hoarding for mageblade etc then that means you basically have uncontested bids on the other items. So you won’t have a mageblade but you will have all the tier gear to their 1 item. 
---
The biggest problem with loot in vanilla is the small number of drops per week. 25~ items between 40 people, with a good % of those being unwanted drops for a guild who’s been doing MC clears for weeks, means that even on average you are only getting 1 item every 2 weeks.
---
Feralas I enjoyed first time round, maybe Tanaris has more legs though, slightly lower level and as you said ZF....thanks.
---
I posted in a thread about warrior itemization by saying I don't know much about it, which would imply I'm either not a warrior or a pretty fucking lousy one. Have you ever seen a warrior with a Heartseeker?
---
I apologize if that was unclear.
---
&gt;/cast \[stance:1/3\] Defensive Stance  
---
&gt;/cast Taunt
---
Should put you in defensive if you are in battle (1) or berserker (3) and immediately use Taunt. Only one button press and will always use both abilities instantly since neither stances or Taunt are on the global cooldown.
---
now that is smart thinking!
---
I see you're a paladin, have you considered grinding some undead?
---
I can't remember the level of those in duskwood
---
IIRC that was in 3.0.2, not in vainilla.
---
What does that meter do that is constantly counting to 100?
---
People that are better and more prepared than you are assholes?
---
Alexstrasza*, play Invincible (This is a very fast mount).
---
....whats this gotta do do with dhks lol.
---
ranking is way different with BGs cause it's much less cheesy. you gotta actually win your games with equal teams. theres a reason rogues are #1 rankers in wpvp.
---
They are a fun way to lose a bit of cash.
---
&gt;Faster is good if the damage is basically the same.
---
You could do with losing the attitude bro because statements like this are just not true. Faster is not "good" if the damage is "basically" the same, because SoC is not normalized meaning you get more out of your AP with a slower weapon.
---
For instance, at 1000 AP (average gear + BoM):
---
Warblade avg white: 425.21 / white dps: 128.85 / avg SoC 327.41 / SoC dps: 38.2
---
Total: 167.05
---
Demonshear avg white: 475.93 / white dps: 125.24 / avg SoC 366.47 / SoC dps: 42.75
---

Demonshear ends up doing more DPS (without calculating the proc, which can trigger Vengeance btw) and the more AP you get, the more this difference increases. At 2000 AP for instance (raid buffed) Demonshear is 4.16 DPS ahead.
---
And that's for a weapon that has 3.6 less DPS baseline, a difference of \~6.2%. If their DPS was even, Demonshear would be massively on top.
---
The "slower = better" mindset mostly stems from PvP, where burst is all that matters so all you look at in a weapon is top end damage. It's true that faster weapons end up having slightly higher Vengeance uptime, but the better your gear becomes, the more important a slower weapon gets as well. So the "slower = better" mantra holds true for weapons of similar DPS, with the exception of weapons with amazing procs of course.

So chill out, you aren't the ret god who figured out a secret that nobody else knows.
---
Its borderline neglect and shouldn't be a case in the first place, but atleast he came out of it.
---
Thanks for the though out reply, very interesting. In my mind though, the argument is about the ratio of alliance to horde and population on a specific server in regards to server health. In that case I still don't see how one can make assumptions on a specific server when it's known that a lot of the data points are wildly inaccurate. How do you control that the server you're looking at isn't one of the ones that's completely incorrect, given that you don't know if any of them are actually correct to begin with?

I have seen serpent sting and rogue poisons push off curse of recklessness and fairie fire :(

TLDR: honor works as intended. You guys are just bad farming the same people and not taking Dr in consideration. Oh yeah nd we are so cheap, we wouldn't release a patch with the keyring, so stop asking for better servers
---
I agree that it's normal behavior, but Wow is a game that many people have an adiction to, and it's easy to lose sight of what's really important. Nothing wrong with commending someone for doing the right thing, even though it seems logical and normal behavior to you.

Is there 1 day where you can farm the much more efficient battlegound honor? So should I stop PvP now and go ham at the 10th?
---
I disagree. I'm enjoying the chaos fully.

Of course i will get a good main hand, are you deliberately trying to not understand my question? 😂With axe of the deep in MH, will flurry axe be A LOT better than say bone slicing in OH?

It's a strange feeling.
---
I am loving and have loved my time in azeroth classic, yet there are so many aspects of the release that blizzard has completely and utterly shat the bed with. 
---
Almost feels like they were intentionally nudging classic onto a short term path, hoping it would die off. Either that or they're terrible at their jobs and knowing their playerbase/game... kinda up in the air still.
---
Oh, never meant to insult whole faction, nor was i actually commenting balance as i have almost zero experience in that so far :). 
---
Was just commenting that i've been slacking the whole month and need to pick up the pace in order to compete with you :D.

Good luck to you and may hopefully we meet in a battle (1v1 if possible) in the open world / BG's :)

you get 1 top bracket spot for every 300 active pvpers at any given week, and it scales downwards so if theres 299 or below active pvpers consistently enough its literally impossible to reach rank 14

---
Wyrmthalak 100% (low data)
---
So let's examine your claim again.
---
Clearly that is not the case and your argument falls apart. There seems to be a skew towards horde populations on PvP servers overall, but your projected hyperboles are simply incorrect and dishonest.

If you think some epic gear that's more or less on par with BW-class gear is worth being a piece of shit for 12 hours a day, every day, for 5 months, then maybe you should reconsider your video game goals.

We have few enough warlocks in our raid, and few enough required debuff slots in general, that I can tell our warlocks to use it on cd in boss fights. If you allocate a debuff slot for it, warlocks can all effectively rotate using the same slot. Once we add nightfall and some other things though, might have to nix the shadowburn slot.

That's another thing that gank defenders always do: you assume that I and everyone else got the game on day one. I did not.i was very busy at work and mulling over whether I wanted a time commitment like WoW. So I didn't get it for the first month. I'm sure you'll say I should have known better, but I played back in vanilla days and it was NOT like this. It was easily possible to quest in the 50s without being farmed like a resource. So I didn't think this was gonna be a thing because it wasn't (most likely because servers were smaller).

When you're in a raid with raid buffs, Barbarous Blade does less DPS than Demonshear, without accounting for Demonshear's proc, actually. So if you're using Demonshear, hold onto it! Your next upgrades will be epic or legendary (so Drakki /  Baron, which are unlikely, or OEB / BRE / Sulfuras).
---
About your last question, hit capping is the first priority. You should also have threat stats on your gear, str, agi and crit. Defense is nice to have but not nearly as important as other stats and you most certainly don’t need to be def capped

Still no keyring. When your are so cheap that you keep re releasing your old games, charge people for them than refuse to fix bugs or implement promised features because you would need to patch the game.

I played many MMOs and i would rank the leveling experience of WoW second place behind Rift (i.e. Vanilla). Most of others MMOs leveling content was an endless grind with uninspiring quests. That's quite a feat for such an old MMO.
---
PS : FF14 was fine (probably 3rd for me) and while i did not stick until endgame, the leveling was not as boring as many other MMO.
---
Badlands is an option also, though the quests arent as clumped and the level spread is... interesting (35-48)
---
Nobody wins over there.
---
Where was Gondor when the Westfall fell...?
---
Played Vanilla back in the day and play classic now. The biggest difference is that the players have changed. There are way more discussions about BIS and more data available with people beeing more dedicated to reach there goals. People used to be fine with MC taking 6 hours over 2 nights to complete. These days people whine if it takes over 1.5 and includes a wipe. This is good when running dungeons though as they runs smoother now.
---
People are also way more into world pvp to rank up now. I played on a decent sized PVP realm back in the day and can’t remember it beeing this bad with pvp teams traveling all over the world. Then again, this was a short period of time in Vanilla before BGs and I might have forgotten all about it.
---
My experience so far has been good as a gnome Warlock. Took a month or so to get to lvl 60 and still missing 1-2 pieces for full BIS pre raid, nothing major and I raid every week so it should be sorted eventually . Got talked into av pvp server that I kinda regret. But got into a good guild for raiding where I made a few new friends.
---
The best experience so far for me was that I chosed to pick up herb/alchemy this time around. So I’ve been traveling the world herbing which I enjoy. After p2 hit I’ve focus more on empty zones such as Azahara, Un’Goro and Silithus without to much trouble. But would love to go back to herbing in EPL and WPL once more. That can hopefully happen once BGs are released.

I've got just what you need! Props to the guy that made the macros. The whole idea requires 1-2h to getting used to but when you do it all becomes fluid and natural.  
---
Its a concept that with using the modifiers keys (shift, ctrl and alt - each stance is "attached" to one modifier) you change to each specific stance when needed with skills dedicated to the stance on buttons 1-5.  
---
For example you are in Battle Stance and want to cast berserker rage. You hold the modifier key (for me its alt for Berserker Stance) and press the corresponding skill on buttons 1-5 that activates Berserkers Rage (for me its button 5). After that you are in Berserker Stance with the Rage activated and can use the dedicated to Ber. St. skills on buttons1-5. If you want to change back to Battle stance for Overpower you press modifier of this stance (for me its shift) and corresponding button (ive got overpower on 2 in battle stance). And it goes on and on like that...  Basically you have macros on buttons 1-5 that change what they do according to the stance you are in at the moment and allow a one-button-press change to other stances. It requires modifiers tho  
---
This concept eliminates the need to double click anything. And is described in full details on the below link.

PvP -&gt; PvE transfers were given out pretty early in WoWs life I believe. Late vanilla or early tbc.

So I've run the first group of bosses in Molten Core with my guild. 
---
How does this work with server reset? If I join a random group will it mess with theirs or my guilds? I'm not quite sure I get all the reset stuff with the raids and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction?
---
Side note, after never doing Molten Core when I was a teenager, it is damn awesome to finally be back there and giving it a go!
---
I'm reacting to the statement not to OP. All I'm trying to say is T1 isn't as terrible as some folks here seem to describe it. I wouldn't pass on a T1 head just because Onyxia drops T2. It's been 4 weeks since our last T2 head drop. Gearing is slow and T1 is nice except the 8/8 bonus which isn't good in raids.
---
Exactly, like omagad, the players made the ranking system. The players allowed the stacking of one faction over the other. The players did...
---
oh waaaaaaaaaait. Fucking crist dense people lol.

That website was just a reference to the list of medium populated PVP realms. The numbers that they are using for those lists you copied are CLEARLY out of date. The individual links to each realm that I posted have up to date censuses and clearly show that most realms have around a 500 player differential during peak hours favoring horde.
---
On my server of Kurinaax there is around 900 alliance on during peak hours in a census taken TODAY whereas the horde are hovering around 2000 at the same times of day. This is a particularly large differential compared to some of the other servers. But, in practice, the mere difference between 200 extra players on the opposing faction can make a massive difference in the gameplay experience.
---
This is because , 1, it only really takes 15-20 players to overrun a zone. So if a faction always has 200 (or 700-1000 extra players on Kurinaax) more players then they can EASILY control more zones than the lower populated faction. And 2, because of differences in gameplay styles, a larger percentage of Horde are actually willing to go out and participate in mass pvp on a regular basis. Having personally tried to get groups together MANY times to push back, I can tell you that my personal experience is that this is not gameplay that Alliance is as eager to engage with as horde are. I can easily get a small group of 5-10 people together but this isn't nearly enough to compete against 20-100 man zergs. Furthermore, players on Alliance simply don't seem interested in STAYING in a zone once it's been occupied.
---
Compare that to the reality of BRD in that the SAME RAID of horde will be there for hours. Because they are there to assert their presence and HOLD a zone. That is what they find fun. Whereas Alliance are more interested in a few skirmishes, mostly around 5 vs 5, and then prefer to move on to a different zone with different players to fight, different class comps, etc.
---
Another example. The Menethil boat was literally camped all day by 15-20 horde. In that case it isn't that alliance couldn't take it back because of sheer numbers... but that they simply aren't interested in keeping it once it's taken. The initial fight is what the alliance finds fun and then they prefer to move on to different gameplay. But the horde camping the boat are there because they enjoy long term area denial as a mode of gameplay.
---
I'm not really interested in discussion of european or asian realms because I'm sure that they have their own cultures and styles of play that have developed there and I have no experience playing on those realms. On NA realms, this is the tendency when it comes to gameplay preference. And honestly, I don't really encounter too many people who don't agree. Most horde players I've talked to are quite open about what they like about the game, what their attitude is, etc. This just happens to clash with the overall way that alliance tends to play the game in a way that discourages people from continuing to play the game at all.
---
Im not sure why you would even dispute that... you have entire threads here of angry alliance players on this subreddit straight up telling you that they don't want to play the game in this way and that they will quit. You might not agree with their reasons... but the fact remains that they WILL quit because of these differences.
---
Personally, I would prefer that the alliance would be more proactive and willing to participate in larger encounters on a more regular basis. But they just don't wanna dude. It's that simple. Occasionally they do. Most of the time they aint into it. And that's a cultural difference.
---
&gt;The flip side is almost every single horde player chose horde because they want to PvP
---
Not sure this is true. 
---
I rolled horde coz my friends are on horde, and we all wanna pve together. Horde has the best access to levelling dungeons too!
---
You missed the first leveling wave, youre more likely to get caught up with the dumbs now, but you can still find actively leveling people all the way to 60.  
---
Yeah its fun, way better than the shit they turned it into over the last 15 years
---
Yeah. I dont get posts like these.. I guess they think if they die sometimes it's a perfectly equal problem?  Like no.. if it's like Herod that just means alliance die 3x for every 1 of yours.
---
Thing is, we did make conscious efforts to roll on the same servers as other boxers, so generally you'd expect that on some realms there are snall gatherings and on some there are none.

xD "grow up", "own up to your factions actions", "you don't let others play the game"
---
The namecalling I did was a response to all the blaming done by the dominated side.
---
You want me to sit in Org and wait until what? Until the queue for world pvp is gone (hint: It doesn't exist). I am saying the system is flawed. You can't blame players for wanting to actually progress in the pvp system - And if there is noone to kill in the open world you need to find other ways to get the honor. 
---
&gt; I am however sick of hearing the dominant faction name calling other human beings and blaming them for what the dominant faction's actions caused.
---
I have the exact same feeling about hearing the dominated faction name calling other human beings and blaming them for that they think is the other faction's fault (playing the game as it was made).
---
I totally get why people move - I've done it myself. This has never been the focus of my comments, but perhaps this is addressed to some of "the others".
---
Do you have a link? My guild used that addon in vanilla but now I can't find one that works with classic.
---
Reroll/uninstall
---
How does that make every pvp server horde imbalanced, unless you're implying only alliance transferred off to heartseeker.
---
The only thing that caused faction imbalance is notimplementing faction specific queues.
---
get 2 wow subscriptions, log onto both at primetime and /who 60 druid etc etc.
---
There are no addons and no accurate data on this sadly
---
Exactly.
---
Where's the option to show more than one server at a time on that site?
---
I mean.. or you just realize this is the result of the honor system, the worst designed system ever made in a game.
---
Demonshear is better both for PvE and PvP.
---
In PvP it's hands down better because it does waaaay more burst, and burst is king in PvP.
---
In PvE, it slightly edges out Warblade (without acounting for Demonshear's proc damage, so really it edges it out handily). Some people will tell you that you shouldnn't use Demonshear due to its proc applying a debuff to the target, but that debuff is low priority (thus doesn't overwrite important ones) and also if you're in a raid that allows rets, it's probably not going to be the end of the world if you knock someone's Deep Wounds off the boss. :p
---
But as another poster mentioned, AV is releasing soon, which will allow you to farm up for the Unstoppable Force mace. It's a pretty easy to get epic that's roughly on par with Obsidian Edged Blade from MC.
---
Someone's running that quiz bot in Orgrimmar instead
---
You would be better off with the priest going shadow, but then you are looking at single target. An added benefit of this is they will be buffing your damage through their shadow weaving talent
---
Priests don't have good AOE, as others have said Holy Nova is incredibly inefficient. I only use it for fun on things like lasher packs in DM and the imps in MC. The spell burns through your mana very fast and doesn't do much damage.
---
You can, there's people ranking at level 59, having epic mount with rank 11 while nobody else sits on their 60%
---
Fear lasts 20 seconds while taking damage.
---
Outstanding!
---
I had a blast from release to about 2-3 weeks ago.  
---
Our guild was ran by some questionable people, it turned out, and loot was just getting distributed in the most idiotic ways.  It wasn't a "I didnt get loot" issue, just... why did player XYZ get it over 10 other fantastic ones.
---
Instead of trying out the other mass mob level of guild rosters, I figured it was as good of a time as any to just hang it up.  Not that I wasn't having fun, but I remember why I dislike being in guilds :P
---
Not if you picked a medium-low pop server.
---
It turns your character to face towards the centre of the green circle. If you're holding down both mouse buttons you turn towards the distraction but immediately turn back because you're actively forcing your character to face the direction you're already going.
---
A common thing is to just open with no stealth and just sinister strike, as cheapshot doesnt increase dps and stealthing behind enemies is a dps loss from not immediately attacking
---
Very funny joke.

I mean i get your point, but it is the dude's kid we talk about. Not his personal hygiëne or diet for example.

How to farm gold as warr solo? playing AH only?
---
Dwarf Priest is irrelevant in TBC since everyone has Fear Ward and Stoneform doesn't remove Blind (it's not considered a poison in TBC).
---
Stealthies and Warriors are definitely better off on Alliance. Everyone else would rather be Horde though.
---
You're honestly being aggressively stupid here.  The honor system directly rewards not just camping people in PVP, but aggressively pursuing people through all means because you need *AS MUCH HONIR AS POSSIBLE* each week to rank up.  The system is designed to make minority factions miserable; shit game design caused this.
---
Never in a million years of your fantasy ideas about how people work would you ever get a decent result from a system like that + server imbalance.  You're a delusional person if you think so.
---
I don't think that kind of person is going to reach 13 either.
---
I agree.
---
Battle shout if you remember to use it. Blood craze heals you for barely anything
---
Lower blackrock depths probably
---
Seriously? If there are like 30 Alliances with 15HK, will they only be placed in the first six brackets or something?
---
No... what's against the rules is cross faction communication of any kind. In reality the only people who actually get punished for this are the ones that are constantly spamming messages meant to 'trigger' the opposing faction to a degree that it pisses off enough people that they get reported by 20-30 people.
---
Blizzard don't give a shit unless enough people report you. And that will only happen if you're being exceptionally obnoxious.
---
yeah lets not go through the redridge path lets land straight in the warzone and expect something else, come on people
---
..anyone who played alot on private servers saw this coming and warned people.  It was more the Asmongold crowd of delusional fanboys who thought P2 would be fun, every private server veteran I know thinks the honor system is miserable bullshit.
---
I've seen that linked several times. It's very anecdotal though. I'm pretty sure OP's issue would happen in vanilla too.
---
Seems like its the 'meta' now. 
---
I love fighting in kargath in large skirmishes. I dont love fishing on my 49 priest and getting instagibbed by a rampaging deathball.
---
Priest + mage would have been perfect, yeah. Aoe farming as a mage is actually way harder than it sounds, you can run out of mana easily, and it's easy to die. Priest fills the gap perfectly, it can pre-shield + second shield the mage for what is basically healing + anti spell pushback for almost no threat, and holy nova has respectable damage as long as you're not the only one aoeing and causes no threat. The stam buff is very good for it too.
---
I still think mage + warlock would work well too. The lock can also help aoe grinding with rain of fire, and if you'd rather play normally, I think it'd be a very efficient combo. Both classes are already very efficient solo, there shouldn't be any need for polymorph when they combine. I've noticed on my warlock I'm always a bit short of killing mobs with all my dots, so a mage that could cast 1 or 2 frostbolts on my dot targets would make it even more simple. Just dot everything up, add a frostbolt or two, let them die on the way, root if they get close.
---
When you kill a boos in a raid, you get an ID. Everybody else in the raid gets the same ID.
---
If you join another group who wants to go MC, they either have no ID or a different ID. If they have a different ID, you can't play with them on this character at all. You just end up in different instances of MC, even when in the same group.
---
If they have no ID at all, you will give them your/your guilds ID, so all bosses you killed will be dead.
---
If you go MC with your guild and kill 5 bosses, a day later your guild kills the remaining 5 bosses without you, you will still have a cleared ID.
---
For the curious: [here's a pic of the Ony buff crowd on October 29th](https://i.imgur.com/GhtTTCz.jpg).

thats not true of any crit reactive proc in wow classic if you stand in the same batch you are hit. Works for pally reckoning and redoubt, shaman eye of the storm, warrior enrage, priest martydom etc.

With an enemy swing timer and some practice you are able to reliably and consistently force these procs.

Just ignore his smerky comments. It was pretty clear to me that you were not a warrior and probably a rogue. Either way your point still stands. The guy just seems to wanna pick a fight instead off giveing advice.
---
Instead of wasting time never getting geared on your main, you should join a guild with loot council. That is unless you suck and would get passed over anyway.
---
the post was fine mate and he can enroll wherever this is what irked me:
---
&gt;I already have a 60 Warrior on Alliance, with an even worse split than Razorgore and having loads of fun. But I have all the best gear, quelserrar, etc
---
&gt;People complaining about server populations are weak.
---
Ofc he is going to get a negative reaction lol. He the. goes on to tell ppl to comment somewhere else
---
If that's true, then what is also true is that the people on PvE servers tend to be mature, coolheaded and nicer to play with due to the kind of people it attracts.
---
&gt; If I went Blood Craze** I'd probably drop Piercing Howl since I don't think I'd ever use it in pvp**
---
Wait.. What? Piercing Howl is amazing!
---
bgs will be crossrealm, apes will instantly be rank14 and when we 10man que we're probably just gonna dodge when we see them (EU realm)
---
Bullshit. I’m on Heartseeker. Plenty of horde everywhere ganking. Fuck outta here.
---
Sounds good! 
---
I'm having a hard time choosing a server to re roll on.
---
Tanaris / The Hinterlands / Feralas, and they all have quests requiring you to go between the zones.
---
Now this is a quest reward I'd keep, and not vendor!
---
You dont understand, let me enlighten you  
---
CHT would be your main hand with distracting dagger as your offhand. Ideally, you would also get aged core leather gloves.  
---
40% of all melee attacks are glancing blows, and at 300 weapon skill, on a raid boss (lvl 63 therefore 315 defense skill), your glancing penalty is 35%. You lose 14% of your AA damage (which is somewhere around 60% of all your damage) right there.  
---
At 308 weapon skill, your glancing penalty is 5% (a gain of 12% more damage on auto attacks), and you have lowered your hit cap from 9% to 6%, and raised your crit cap. above 308 you dont get any more benefit for glancing blows.
---
A fury warrior has a 40% chance to gain 1 extra rage on attack, and also just gains more rage with faster weapons. Their main dps ability is not a weapon strike, bloodthirst is based on their total AP, you can even use it when you are disarmed (though your unarmed skill will need to be up if you plan to hit). During the execute phase, this is actually even better because more rage generation = more insane execute numbers.  
---
This makes daggers super viable because of the availability of +daggers gear. The other option is buying edgemasters gloves for like 700g, for +7 weapon skill.  
---
Warriors dont have a +hit or +weapon skill talent like rogues do so gear setups like this are way more effective. I have 308 swords on my rogue from my racial and talents alone, and 5% hit, so it frees my gearing up alot more to just max out my dmg.  
---
My warrior has distracting dagger and Keris of zul serak and I am beating most warriors in my runs because of the weapon skill advantage, and since he just dinged 60 its a great way to cruise right into raiding and keep up.
---
There's a few ways you can do this. The simplest would just be to just consider all the PvP servers together (with each day, or each week, being a separate time point). I don't think that considering a specific set Alternatively, if you did want to look at each server individually you could try something a bit trickier such as assigning weights to each server based on the population size. Alternatively you could restrict it to only servers of a certain population size (although that introduces other potential issues so overall I'd just consider all the PvP servers together, it's more generalizable that way anyway). There's other ways of controlling for such things but those are some of the simplest.
---
Lastly keep in mind that in order for the data to be confounded, it not only needs to be inaccurate but differentially inaccurate (which is what the other guy was saying). In other words, let's say that only 50% of players on a server raid and have their raids logged and therefore are captured by the data. Does this mean that the data is confounded? No, unless there's a difference between the proportion of alliance players that log their raids the the proportion of horde players that log their raids. Of course, there is a slight selection bias here in that we are getting data only from raiders, but I haven't seen a compelling argument for why that invalidates our conclusion that the state of PvP on servers is driving alliance players away. 
---
At the end of the day, if you look at the discussion section of any quantitative study involving human participants published pretty much anywhere, there'll always be a paragraph or two where they discuss their limitations since in any field of research involving human participants there's no such thing as a perfect study. (In fields such as chemistry or physics you probably can have a perfect study since you might not need to worry about ethics and all the sociodemographic factors of your participants so much and all of the variables that could be affecting them, but that's not my area of expertise at all.)
---
As someone who played alliance thaurissan-us in wotlk with a 1:9 A:H we did wintergrasp with a permanent 20 stacks of tenacity. 
---
It never helped the 20 of us win vs the 1000+ horde.
---
The game is great. But I can't compete in P2. Waiting for relaxing BG honor spam and farming stuff for BWL.
---
I saw this coming.
---
Well... I watch lots of youtubers and streamers, most private server veterans were warning about this and farmed stuff for this phase. 
---
Im just sad because I didnt have enough time to level up and gear myself. So I became victim like most other people.
---
I also hoped that all pvp and ganking would focus on couple specific zones and not spread this much.
---
That's a 2-min cooldown to remove debuffs that are instantly applied and have no cooldown themselves. Bleh.
---
You think this way until you realize "no shortage of action" means getting corpsecamped and being only able to find solo horde once every 30 minutes.
---
 It does work just as you describe, and is completely automatic once you have it set up. 
---
There are a couple of downsides I've found, but are relatively minor:
---
-Before logging in to the game, make sure Dropbox is completely done syncing the files. If you log in too early it'll big, and you'll have to close and relog.
---
-I'm not sure what causes it, but occasionally my symlinks will disappear. It is not a big deal because you can just set up the symlink again in seconds, but just be aware. You can same yourself some time by including a txt file in your Dropbox folder with the symlink commands, that way you can just open a cmd prompt and copy+paste.
---
Thats what they signed up for when rolling on a pvp server
---
\-Kill Elementals (If you play around 3-7am server time you can goto toxic horrors since it will be basically empty)
---
\-Farm Herbs in Azhara or felwood while killing NPCs that drop Runecloth
---
\-Killing Naga's in Azhara from Big mouth clam
---
\-Kill the Furbolgs in Winterfall Village East of Everlook for Winterfall Firewater. There are also Rich thorium spawns by this village  (East area can be quite contested but there are furbolgs West of everlook aswell towards the Felwood/Moonglade cave)
---
I've used these methods aswell as some random instance farming. it's all about consistency :) Gl.
---
Goodbye, old friend. May the force be with you.
---
Best measure of a population is to look at the auction house. If you're curious about a particular realm - make a level 1 Human, run to Stormwind and see how many auctions there are.
---
Then delete it, make a level 1 orc and run to Orgrimmar to see how many auctions there are.
---
Can ZT into Horde empire?
---
anyone can try multi boxing on retail for free to see if they like it for retail; but it does have some limitations.
---
You can create  a starter account next to your regular account.
---
The starter account cant mail, trade or level up past 20.
---
On battle net select your regular account and press play, put wow on window mode and go back to battle net and select the starter account and press play again. Put it into window mode also.
---
You can control both toons getting a free program called 'hot key' it's  a little tricky to program; so look up guides online. But its pretty cool controlling 2 toons at once.
---
Congrats! Dire wolf is the best!
---
"Horde has no right to complain"
---
You responded to somebody who said he enjoyed his first PvP experience to say "PvP servers are meant for PvP" and to brag about how cool you are for not complaining about being corpsecamped. 
---
As if you're not allowed to enjoy PvP unless or until you're getting corpsecamped for 12 levels. That's gatekeeping.
---
Good thing it never happened
---
Look at this old [Vanilla PvP Video (Vurtne)](https://youtu.be/DgV-FPWuWQk?t=360). At 6 Minutes you can see that the render distance was the same as today.
---
Look up the current state of Flamelash you don't want to play that.
---
Ok to clarify all major end games zones such as wpl/epl SG BRM BS
---
Does Booming Voice affect it?
---
They have pugs, /roll is the most fair system in that case.
---
Thanks! This table is great.
---
I don't understand why you are heavily downranking flash heal, and if people just need topping off it's a weird choice of spell to use. On trash the damage on melee becomes somewhat predictable so you can queue heals or greater heals on them.
---
I doubt your greater heal rank 1 is consistently healing 2k+, which is the HP defecit of geared raiders
---
There's barely any usage for prayer of healing in MC or Ony, unless you do weird stuff like sit in a melee group and spam it downranked on trash. It's also quite prone to having some of the heals on your party sniped so you end up healing 2 or 3 people, which is inefficient.
---
If you don't have assigned renew priests you are almost certainly either overwriting another priest's renew or they are overwriting yours all the time. It's not a very efficient spell either and battling another priest over it makes this even worse. I tend to only use mine to let the warlocks life tap.
---
I'm also not sure how you are running out of mana unless you are not using many healers or your raid tends to underperform.
---
Make sure your UI is setup to show incoming heals and setup some sort of stopcasting macro on your heals if you aren't using an addon to do so.
---
if you believe it's 10k online at the same time you are so incredibly wrong dude
---
Then I'd trust the other guy!
---
No, my Lord Aragorn, we are alone.
---
Flamelash is EU, but yeah 99% of the time the braggarts talking about "winning" are the same people who'd come here and bitch endlessly if the tables were turned.
---
What exactly does this mean?
---
The added trees, wheat fields, and proper roads really make the zone feel more vibrant and alive. I always feel like Blizzard could have done a lot more in their early zone designs to capture the feeling you do in your art. Amazing work as always. :)
---
Yes, but there is no reason to assume alliance or horde logs more or less. So the total numbers are incorrect, but the ratios are pretty close to correct.
---
You and everyone else... I played on a TBC private server and Druids were the most popular by far.
---
Blizzard went way overboard with the Druid changes in the expansion IMO. I prefer Classic Druids.
---
Nope you misunderstood my first post. Re read it.
---
Holy shit.. I know it’s better, thanks for not answering my question :)  how does my skill level matter? I will be as skilled regardless of what axe i use as my OH smh
---
Untarget your target and then re-target them so you aren't trying to attack.
---
I would wait until the 10th for BGs and level any Alts you want to in the meantime.
---
If you must level spam dungeons as others have suggested.
---
Best of luck!
---
Flurry is only a little behind deathbringer, so unless you somehow get two deathbringers it will last you until BWL easily.
---
The main QQ will be getting rolled by premades! 100% this will be the topic for the snowflakes!
---
GOOF!
---
Its about 40-60 so yeah pretty balanced
---
But I can already fill all these in now, lol
---
Classic wowhead has it listed as 10gold.
---
They're not keeping count of how many times they killed you in a row especially if they'res like 40 of them lol.
---
They should add bgs, so that people can compete with earning honor without being forced to camp fps to stay competitive in the honor rankings
---
A full stack of wound poison is in no way instantly applied. And the immunity gives you enough time to heal to full efficiently. I don't think I need to talk about the prevalence of rogues in TBC arena? Besides, what would be a better race? Undead?
---
No way you can compare weapons with procs using a simple stat weights tool. I don't think it even has a value for flurry axe proc.
---
&gt; Rend and the crit dot work against that.
---
I never use rend, because it's very inefficient use of rage, and the crit dot is exclusive to the arms tree.
---
&gt;But most importantly, threat was a constant battle.
---
This is something I can't imagine. Especially if you haven't been using mind blast and the warrior stuck to defensive stance, you should never over-aggro from DPS nor healing as a priest.
---
&gt;My playstyle also didn't go well with his, he'd be all about bursting mobs down, and rather unexpectedly too.
---
I think that's the main issue. Warrior and priests, when you play optimally, is goign to be one of the best levelling duo's exactly because they cover eachother's weaknesses so well. You should have no downtime at all when you do it right. However, if you don't play perfectly, and for example get aggro or don't get spirit tap, you lose a lot of that efficiency because the playstyles don't allow covering eachother's weaknesses.
---
If coordination is a problem, going double druid or double shaman is more attractive for duo leveling. They can both take all roles, but at least you know eachother's capabilities and requirements better.
---
I believe the alliance guilds moved with just 24 hours remaining on the transfer window.
---
No it wasn't. Player caps on vanilla servers was something around 3000 concurrent players. Classic allows up to 10000, meaning the same amount of space and resources is 3 times as crowded. What we have now is far from no changes.
---
People grew up, they thought alliance was cool when they were kids but now that theyre not teens anymore they like horde
---
Same here. 10/10 and 1/1 already, but still loving it, getting upgrades, putting work into enchantments, exploring different farming strats, and occasionally visiting Hillsbard with /pvp on.
---
what is that?
---
Because you said you are casual. Dropping 500g+ isn't that casual. Also weaving swings and managing rage are things casuals don'tusualy do.... Why ask a question you already think you know the answer to?
---
What makes you think the majority wasnt?
---
Yeah I back this. I rerolled on to Anathema and it has been a fantastic experience so far. Good pop during evenings / weekends, but not so much that farming  spots are crowded. no gank squads that I've dealt with at all. I've had some pvp but it wasnt the hair pulling gank / corpse run rinse and repeat that I was dealing with on Stalagg..
---
thanks, I will give it a try.
---
nah you can do it as a different class, honor is calculated on damage done so you can just grab 4 healers and a mage and have them follow you on a warrior(prefereably but any class works really) and have them only heal and cc while you do all damage 
---
can grind ridiculous honor like this
---
They never removed the stun proc, they just nerfed the crap out of it after too much QQ on the forums by mages.
---
Imagine being stuck with the unplayable class balance of Classic.
---
How many undead rogues can you count.? I got stuck at 23.
---
Yes this is the back door to mc and the only way you should enter if the mountain is occupied.
---
Risens groups always provide quite the challenge for us
---
We agree that BG's were supposed to launch with BWL. Where your falling flat on your face is finding out whether BG's were pushed out early or BWL pushed out late. Still waiting on that source you said you had Intel on.
---
I mean Im getting thunderfury on my melee hunter, i see Nothing wrong
---
Pvpvirgin servers
---
Chad thundercockpissy destroyer pve servers
---
I think its time for Medivh to open another portal to    some other planet for the Horde to conquer and dispose of the natives :)
---
My experience is that the "PvP flow" is back and forth between Horde and Alliance, which is IMO perfect. Sometimes, Horde has control over BRM entrance, Alliance over MC portal. Sometimes, it's the other way around. Healthy balance I would say. 
---
World PvP is another thing as Alliance seems to be more coordinated while Horde is much more disorganized. Honestly, I fell pretty good about the balance on Razorgore as it's far from being one-sided which is great. Don't mind the ocasional corpse run, I've rolled on PvP realm after all.
---
I hate these forums so much. It doesn't matter what blizzard does they will always get responses like: "... and what about THAT problem? Are you ignoring THIS?" and "THIS is what you are doing right now? Why not THAT?"
---
Undead or Blood Elf for sure. If a Rogue has been on you long enough to stack Wound Poison up to 5, you're not casting any heals any time soon, even if you cleanse the stack.
---
It’s like 3% over 12 sec thou, at like 40hp a tick with 5k hp, i wouldnt compare that to 15stam, 15 stam is actually pretty good hah
---
Lost count how many times I charge at a guy only to end in a gank of 5-10 ppl.
---
That’s what I keep thinking about this - the horde *won*. They won the game in a way that’s hardly otherwise possible, conquering a server is a rare win condition.
---
just group up and fight back
---
yeah that was at the beginning. They fixed it later on with much better hardware. still funny to see a community driven project can handle more players than small indie blizz...
---
Join a 10-15 man group and you will plow through every zone since horde doesnt run in groups that size due to it not being efficient honor. Alliance groups on whitemane demolish the horde until we eventually all get together with numbers.  But then we disperse and they rez and continue to do well. If you ever saw the Risen guys pvp, theyre doing it right.
---
Correct, I think it's a 180° angle in front of you is the greatest sight but it might be smaller than strictly planar behind/in front.
---
Im aware of that gap you can jump through next to the NPC, but I never did it this way.
---
Bless, are you hangry
---
Equip a quiver and true aim gauntlets if you happen to have them. Everything else would be total overkill, or you would be better off farming an arcane resist set.
---
&gt;The best spell damage 1h in bwl gives 64 sp the GM dagger gives 72sp and 1% crit
---
Staff of the Shadow Flame gives you 84 spellpower and 2% crit, which is what eligible casters would most likely prefer. Ashkandi is similar to the GM Claymore, and r14 weps are pretty close to a CTS/Maladath combo. It can swing either way between the two, but you get the point. 
---
&gt;its also a lot of prestige
---
Nobody gives two shits about the prestige except for the person ascribing it to himself. At best, members of your faction will indifferently say "gz" to you while inwardly thinking you're a hopeless addict with too much time on his hands, and too small of a life outside of a video game. 
---
On top of that, if your "prestige" was "earned" through incessant griefing and corpse camping, you're not going to garner any respect from the opposite faction, whether it's in BGs or world pvp. 
---
&gt;Do you really think just because someone is 60 its a fair fight
---
I didn't imply anything of the sort. There's nothing inherently fair about Classic wow. It's the way you choose to play that makes the game interesting. If you choose to tryhard every single player encounter and use everything you can possibly use, that's on you. Most people don't play that way, and world pvp mostly comes down to circumstance. When the servers are this imbalanced, though, it just makes it less and less likely for either faction to enjoy fights where there's a comparable opportunity to win.
---
Lol you can Phrase in whatever direction you want to.
---
Blizzard created the Need to have massive Server Transfers in the first place. 
---
They then offered Transfers to dead Servers which obviously no one is really inclined to take because the only Advantage is no Queue time the rest is mostly disadvantage.
---
Instead of making Server Transfer lists where People could sign up and they make a  big Transfer to fill one Server. Start a new list.
---
They created the Problem - tried to solve it - and made it worst tbh. 
---
I cannot blame the Players because Blizzard is like always being super closed and not letting out any Information on Server Pops etc. so People could see what Servers are like and act accordingly. It is a fcking shit Show by Blizzard because they are soooo secret and cannot communicate for shit.
---
You try to blame the Players for something - they could have acted better obviously - but they shouldn't have Needed to. They pay for this shitfest and Blizzard is putting 0 Attention to classic. 
---
You try to blame the Players. It is always the vocal minority. You can Keep your "arguments" but it doesn't Change how Little Blizzard is delivering for the millions they cash in each month
---
Many people even on my horde guild on whitemane have no interest in world pvp, but theyre excited for BGs. I imagine this is even moreso the case for alliance.
---
I hope so too, but I'm not very optimistic...
---
God I hope this is a troll comment
---
Love it.
---
God, no.  I've already lost my kids to Fortnite, so that would be a step too far for anyone, lol
---
Didn't Blizzard change both the queue behavior and the addon API, making it basically impossible to run premade AVs?
---
*Have you tried not corpse camping the same lowbies over and over again?*
---
I play a troll as fury and don't want to pay up for +7 skill gloves, is distracting dagger (+6 daggers) and a descent  mh-dagger viable? shouldnt +6 skill be better than booth dals rends w/o +skill?
---
I guess i should of clarified I have a 60 paladin on Ali this is a sham
---
Do you guys seriously believe no one plays Horde because they enjoy the asthetic?
---
Sucks to have kids
---
We don't know for certain but it is a very viable solution IMO. They also said they didn't want free Transfers and offered them. So I just guess that this will come in the future too :D
---
Premades will definitely ruffle some feathers
---
Well I am hoping to farm my welfare TUF as well as Don Julio's so I can't really complain...
---
If you bring pugs then you don't really have a choice. If I join a raid as pug it's not my concern if someone else got no upgrades for weeks. That's the problem with roll system and why most guilds run dkp or loot council, but you need to actually have a consistent guild group for that. If you're bringing 2-3 pugs, why not just run without them? You don't need full 40 players for MC, though if you're not clearing rag that could be a problem.
---

---
They actually won the world of warcraft.
---
Azeroth is finaly at peace. 😂
---
There are eighteen undead rogues hidden in this picture
---
Scarab Lord wasn't a title, either. The title was added in TBC.
---
Oh nvm then:)
---
It’s fine as long as your raid group is the same every raid. Eventually you’ll be the only one rolling on items. If the group keeps changing every week you always have the same low chance to win on gear which kinda sucks.
---
20-25 are usually enough to win AV, so they dont necessary need the whole raid in there. On undocumented servers it was enough to just queue at the same time and most people would get in the same bg.
---
But we shall see how it is with cross server bgs.
---
well you get 12 stamina, 12 strenght, 30 FR and the thorns effect!
---
as Fury
---
whats better?
---
Quel'Serra + Mirah's Song or Dal'Rend's Set
---
Sometimes I wish there were transfers from a pvp to a rppvp server :(
---
Wanna do BRD?
---
Alliance spergs who left for a 70/30 A/H Server now do the same to horde there. But yeah, players are sooooooo different..
---
Yeah it's so much better when they just quit the game instead.
---
This just sounds like a pipe dream because how do you intend to get the bindings? And ravager would only be useful for a random bit of aoe on trash.
---
Ok I'll take it off. Sorry about that.
---
Common sense.
---
Horde out number Alliance, assuming equal percentage of players willing to PvP, then the queue times will be longer for the horde.
---
A couple of things we do know, horde consider themselves more into PvP and back during Vanilla (where alliance out numbered horde) the queue times for alliance were between 15 minutes to an hour.
---
From this we can surmise that the horde will have fairly lengthy queue times.
---
have you played Elder Scrolls Online? I thought the quests were great in that, better writing/more interesting stories than Classic, and all speech was voiced so you got a little more character from the NPCs.
---
If only the ability said that it increases threat!
---
Enh can tank dungeons just fine though if they have a shield.
---
Not shadow, but those trinkets are nice
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/BlueDistinctAlpacaHumbleLife
---
No, it was Blizzard.  It was whatever moron at Blizzard in 2005 designed a system which directly incentivizes mass murdering as many enemy players as humanly possible to get the best possible in game rewards.
---
The honor system is shit.  People just need to accept that.
---
Finally somebody said it.
---
As a horde on flamelash i didnt really get the memo. I mainly log in to do ony and mc twice a week, because lvling an alt was too painful. Mainly because of the max lvl campers.
---
If this is the state of ally on our server then im inclined to migrate too if possible. Im a PvE player at heart but no danger in the world is just boring.
---
Ah right, can't beat multiboxing so the solution is that we should all run with 40 man multiboxs to be able to play the game
---
This is it, makes me really sad. I dont think something like vanilla wow will ever be possible again.
---
what's the difference?
---
Serious question, when bgs will kill both is there even a difference?
---
Yes, I play on a PVP server. 55 - 60 took me an average of 15h per level.
---
Never played WoW before classic.
---
Getting to 60 was fun. Getting full pre-bis was fun. Getting epic mount was fun. Getting raid loot was/is fun.
---
Now I'm just a raid logger waiting for more content to be added. Cba grinding alts, rather do raids/wait for new content and play Twisted Leagues in OSRS.
---
Something tells me if your guild made Hand of Rag, that’s not really an issue tho :p
---
They're whining but you're right, if you intend to rank you're encouraged to do the cheapest shit possible to farm as many kills as possible.
---
BGs are out in four days when these problems will magically go away. Maybe just take a break from the game for a week or make a new alt? More complaining about rolling a PvP server, that's all I see.
---
I guess I meant more the guilds with the most 60s
---
Dal'rend set
---
Cause god forbid you have some private time. He is not put on this earth to entertain his kids every waking hour of the day. Yes small children need a lot of attention, but they also need to learn that not every single waking second is about them.
---
Attitudes like yours are seriously pathetic.
---
I did it in Vanilla and TBC. That was different. Blizzard claims they've changed how the queues work (queueing simultaneously won't result in joining the same BG anymore, they shuffle the queue) and the API to simulate a click in the UI has been removed.
---
When I was like 13 I always wanted to 1. Spec moonkin to raid and 2. Be given hand of rag so I can hold hand of rag as a moonkin. My guild never let me do either. But they used to make jokes everytime eye dropped and would pretend they were going to give it to me. But they never did 😭.
---
Looks like a render touched up to look hand drawn to me, but just a guess. However it was done, it's fantastic.
---
I sure do. And I can see mobs 200y away so I should also see my own team.
---
Hiding in IF
---
How do premades dodge each other?
---
That's a lot of time still lol
---
I know Its all about #nochanges but, maybe don't give honor for 5v1 ganks.  Make it not worth it, so people have to fair fight or nothing.  Like it you kill someone 3v1 don't split the honor by 3 make it so shitty no one would want to do it.
---
Phase 2 was a terrible shitfest, because every undead mage and their grandmother thinks they will get to rank14 by sitting at alliance FPs killing honorless targets and then killing 50% hp fresh respawns all day.  
---
Luckily the BG queue system will weed out most of horde, not fun waiting one hour for a WSG game, been there, not gonna roll horde ever again in Classic.  
---
The Pve was a lot easier, now that the game is mostly solved, compared to vanilla, it's not 2-3 carrying every raid but more like 20-25 which is nice, even pugs clear in 1-1.5hour.
---
When I invite Enh to DPS for my dungeon group I don't want them to tank.
---
Undocumented servers made no effort to stop that. Blizzard did on official servers sometime in Cata/Wotlk. And since Classic is based on Legion, I highly doubt we'll see preform av enabler again.
---
Bloodfang has close to 0 alliance, right?
---
Exactly, farming 10+ hours per week to raid 30 minutes is the way to go. I love spending 95% of my time in a video game doing boring chores to entertain myself for the other 5%...
---
Not as fun as I expected it to be. Endgame is an absolute snooze fest.
---
This is so true, Its pretty stupid that it says nothing about it in the tooltip.
---
It would be very kind of you to help me with that mate.
---
Pleaze explain why
---
Still dont get it. You can log in for your raid and maybe 3 hours in total on the other 6 days to farm gold for your consumes. Its not like you have to raid each day for several hours.
---
8/10 I find your lack of harvest golems disturbing. 
---
Seriously, good work though, alliance scum.
---
see now. all these complaints should be shutdown quick cause theyre part of them game. faction imbalance, while technically being a part of the game, at least has some legitimacy. that said i hope theres major queue time penalties for que dodging.
---
&gt; Staff of the Shadow Flame gives you 84 spellpower and 2% crit, which is what eligible casters would most likely prefer.
---
Yeah but for PvP as a warlock spellstone is amazing versus casters so you're better off getting a 1h.
---
Sorry to break it to you but you won’t be getting any sick pvp gear when 20v1’ing
---
What's the value in big mouth clam?
---
there are plenty of "late night" raiding guilds, usually 2200-2400.
---
There's none. The logic beeing that you shouldn't see enemy bars from too far away because pvp.
---
Good to see the alliance faltering on even the close server pops
---
There was an obvious demand for it as shown by private servers. Blizzard saw it as a way to make profit.
---
That beeing said, after having played classic for a while I get certain choices Blizzard made. Because the honor grind was not intended to be the way it is now. The gear that drops was supposed to be useful for someone etc.
---
It must be a pretty gigantic difference then yeah.
---
How exactly? They rolled on a server and started playing the game, without knowing faction balance or ANYTHING.
---
Below is a list of potentially helpful macros. If anyone wants anything else, just ask.
---
Stance Swapping Note: You do NOT need a condition on the stance swaps in most cases. For example, if you are already in Battle Stance it just won't do anything if you have `/cast Battle Stance` in a macro.
---
The most basic of macros on any melee class will turn on your auto attack with your skill presses. Here is an example with Heroic Strike.
---
    #showtooltip Heroic Strike
---
    /cast Heroic Strike
---
    /startattack
---
Sweeping Strikes - switch to Battle Stance and cast Sweeping Strikes.  
---
    #showtooltip Sweeping Strikes
---
    /cast Battle Stance
---
    /cast Sweeping Strikes
---
Charge/Intercept - Charge if out of combat, Intercept if in combat. This is also able to charge/intercept your mouseover if you happen to have one. 
---
    #showtooltip [nocombat] Charge; Intercept
---
    /target [@mouseover, harm, nodead]
---
    /cast [nocombat] Battle Stance; Berserker Stance
---
    /cast [nocombat] Charge; Intercept
---
Overpower - This exact format can be used for virtually any skill that one works in certain stances.
---
    #showtooltip Overpower
---
    /cast Overpower
---
Rend - now Rend is special since it can be used in Battle Stance or Defensive Stance. This means we would only want to swap stances if we aren't in Battle or Defensive. This macro handles that. I've chosen to go to Battle Stance if I happen to be in Berserker and try to Rend.
---
    #showtooltip Rend
---
    /cast [nostance:1/2] Battle Stance
---
    /cast Rend
---
Intimidating Shout - This breaks on any damage, so it's best to turn off your attack.
---
    /cast Intimidating Shout
---
    /stopattack
---
It's good to have macros to switch between your main DPS weapon set and your 1-Hand + Shield set. Equipslot 16 is mainhand and 17 is offhand.
---
Equip 2-Hand Weapon
---
    /equipslot 16 Gatorbite Axe
---
Equip 1-Hand + Sheild
---
    /equipslot 16 Tooth of Eranikus
---
    /equipslot 17 Stoneshell Guard
---
Interrupt Macro - Pummel/Shield Bash
---
    #showtooltip [equipped:shields,stance:1/2] Shield Bash; Pummel
---
    /cast [noworn:shield] Berserker Stance
---
    /cast [equipped:shields,stance:1/2] Shield Bash; Pummel
---
    /startattack 
---
Gotta run for now. I have plenty more, but this will do for now, lol.
---
Uh, ok?
---
Why are you flagged tho
---
Fantastic and so very enjoyable to read! Thank you so much for sharing this interesting piece of Wow history
---
when bgs are out people wont roam in groups with any luck, dependant on queues horde might, either way theres  good wpvp to be had with bgs released, contesting farm spots etc with small numbers is decent, firemaw is one of the more healthy servers so you should be fine unless horde has 2h queues
---
&gt; You think you do, but you don't 
---
What's happening now is Blizzard proving their point to players the hard way.
---
15 crits little man put that dam in my hand
---
Have you tried finding a grinding spot somewhere underwater in azshara? I haven’t tried this myself but the idea came to my while I was trying to fall asleep the other night.
---
It was a PUG from what was listed. 
---
/roll was the rule, lets just honor the rule for the loot and move on 🤣
---
If it was all guild, I would def give it to melee over hunter as it (as you stated, benefits them more). 
---
I have to ask...  Who hurt you so, to be so salty! 🤣
---
Well then why do you even care, bunky?
---
They are used for different things. Ravager is only good for multiple mobs but give nothing for single target. Optimally you would want both. Upgrade wise you have Rotgrips Axe or sword/polearm from Uldaman.
---
Any idea what phase this is?
---
&gt;Also how the fuck am I supposed to Viper Sting and outlast a Warlock?
---
Hope they're shit, because you don't.
---
You can get Golden pearls which are worth between 25-50g depending on your server
---
Sad indeed
---
Horde playing on Herod and there is ally camping the AH, mailbox and portal dude at all times in Org.
---
you can get 10% pretty much for free every day. 25-35% easily if you just actually play 1 AV a day
---
For the gold it costs to get Crusader, you could buy a Kang the Decapitator on my server. Might as well just get that.
---
You mean playing the game like Blizzard designed it?!?!
---
Okay so you stop ganking as much. Now you lose your PvP rank because a few will keep doing it regardless so you drastically fall down the rankings. 
---
People have little choice if they want to succeed because it's literally impossible to prevent everyone from camping.
---
Then lots of MoFo are are cheating. Good luck sniffing them out.
---
This warms my heart. Thank you for this
---
You'll be put in as premades. 5 man premades can significantly alter the outcome of WSG but won't do much in AV.
---
Lol mine too :P
---
Then he probably won’t make the hammer.
---
Unless buying some gold.
---
Recount seems accurate with the damage but inaccurate with the dps. I used both for a few days because I forgot to turn off recount and the damage numbers were nearly identical but somehow recount told me I was consistently doing 200 more dps than details did.
---
There’s this common idea in my guild that BGs will solve the issue of horde camping all flight paths and boats and dungeons and BRM, but I’ve tried to explain how horde outnumber the alliance in total so the queue times will be lengthy.  It feels very head in the sand, although there’s nothing we can do about it.
---
I’ve also mentioned that the people who are doing the camping are ruining the game for themselves, it doesn’t feel good to be right.
---
enjoying the zerg fest here as well. take the free transfer to a pve realm and move on.
---
You are not the sharpest tool in the shed huh?
---
Funny that it seems you think horde on gehennas have a cakewalk , i’ve just this past 15min trying to get to brd and my corpse is now at the chains....
---
It's not that interesting. We showed them that there was a market for going "back" in a genre that has traditionally only moved forward. It's the 280k+ signatures that did it. Investors don't go by gut feeling or nostalgia, they go by the numbers.
---
I don't think a neckbeard redditor can call other people neckbeard redditors
---
ok, good to know. thanks
---
then it shouldn't have gotten it
---
The coolest part is that instead of caving to the cries of "go to a PvE server" from all the maladjusted subhumans, the wily Alliance left them a PvE server instead.
---
Almost on any classic pservers multiboxing was forbidden. 
---
I'm really against multiboxing, but I dualboxing atm because it's fun and i can level two characters simultaneously.
---
Guess you didn't get the Dal Rends? 
---
If Blizzard put faction locks in place, you'd be having a shitfit that you couldn't play Orc or Undead for their superior PvP racials and crying that you were now gimped. 
---
Suck my ass, cupcake. And when you're done, go enjoy your new PvE realm.
---
Which, incidentally, is my favorite way to prove a point. The game is fine but the people...ugh.
---
I only played wow around release and a year or so after and when I think back, it's Westfall, Goldshire and the spooky woods across the river from Goldshire that I think of.
---
Good times.
---
Holy shit you are delusional, you guys are acting like Alliance and Horde are 2 different type of HUMAN SPECIES. Holy shit you dramaqueens cant grasp the fact that alliances does the same shit on their dominated servers.
---
What rotation do you use as 2h fury? I've been told to use regular Bloodthirst &amp; WW with hamstring spam as horde, but I would lose tons of rage by going to battle stance for hamstring every cd.
---
It's the same for horde on Herod. Org is always camped, DM is alliance territory 90% of the time, mc entrance is camped by each like 50-50
---
One thing that has helped me is to keep berserker rage up when I'm tanking mobs that don't fear. You get a lot of extra rage while getting hit.
---
A month of effectively shutting down the world for the other faction unless they move out in a sizable group usually does the trick.
---
Smaller raids are way better. I hole they release tbc after classic.
---
Alliance has less motivation going to WSG compared to AV since it doesn't favor them so hard (still idk about jump option, we will see if it still will be there and if it will be used heavily), so most of the alliance will go to AV, making WSG queues even more unbearable.
---
There is also a rare leather helmet that gives +7 to axes. But the npc that drops it is pretty rare
---
Keep making excuses.
---
Did you really expect people who couldn't play the game most of the time to stick around?
---
very informative.
---
Solo DM tribute, your best choice as a hunter. No comparison. 
---
Since it’s in a instance you can farm it any time of the day, don’t have to compete with others about resources. And the gold comes from vendoring loot. You are never reliant on market prices like most other grinds.
---
You are printing gold into the economy.
---
Plus in the beginning its quite challenging before you get a hang of it, so it’s fun compared to mindless grinds.
---
You seem upset at your behavior having consequences.
---
You may have watched his speech more recently than me, but in my mind he meant it in the sense of "we've added a bunch of convenience which you couldn't live without now".
---
There's a big difference between reserve runs and tanks being hard to find for dungeons (a vanilla thing anyway) and "we willfully fucked the server populations".
---
Either way, it's not like any of this wasn't already known, mentioned and played out on PServers like you said.
---
Ninja Looting isnt an implemented feature. Grinding honor, getting ranks and getting gear is. Did i really have to break this down for you???
---
Mograine will follow Flamelash footsteps. My whole guild transferred to Bloodfang with me and my brother included. Today I am gonna test run to BRM.
---
Sounds like a bunch of slippery slope arguments and nothing much against tbc itself.
---
Eh, people thought they were minmaxxing back then as well, they just didn't know as much as we do today
---
It does. ;D
---
Nah, he blew up at the way people on the forums acted, being shitty, calling the game/Blizzard trash, all the usual whining and complaints.
---
He saw bitter assholes drive away new players one too many times and then blew up over it.
---
Not a single horde is whining, they can trasnfer aswell.
---
??? There’s nothing legendary about being in a imbalanced server in a imbalanced game that favours Horde over the Alliance.
---
Yikes
---
Not here for any firsts, just want to challenge myself to get a toon to 60 in less than 20 days played (I ADHD afk a lot, or go off on ridiculous side adventures, or stand around in town and just talk for an hour). Using a guide will streamline my brain into functionality and I think it'll be a fun personal challenge after having leveled dozens of toons the old fashioned way over the last 15 years. This will be a new experience for Classic (and really, how much more Vanilla-like can you get than having a new gaming experience?!) that will be for an alt to partake in after my main is 60. Have I mentioned I'm incapable of leveling quickly? I'm a whopping 41 after three months of playing, but profs are leveled and a few alts are off and running.
---
Hamstring can be used in zerker bro...
---
are you kiddding? faction imbalance makes up like 90% of the complaints and other complaints dont really gain any traction.
---
I hope you're implying that group is about to go and crush some skulls, and not that they're hiding. 60/40 is not even remotely a good excuse.
---
Then you have a comprehension issue.
---
When we downed Garr with 20 people last week and were laughting and cheering on Discord, what I kept thinking to myself: “Tottaly not worth 12 days played on this char. What a gigantic waste of time!” /s
---
Great read. To this day Kara was still my favorite dungeon / zone in the entire game.
---
I honestly think it was a money scheme to drag people off private servers, blizzard have always been adamant in their detest for private servers.
---
Great server imo. As others have said, ally holds their ground pvp wise. Great skirmishes in wpvp and raid nights. Sure, you'll get ganked from time to time when traveling solo but that goes for both factions.
---
Stop feed the ego
---
no, some people get ganked but dont whine like pussies on reddit.
---
Lol 60g to run MC. I use 1 FR pot. It used to 2 pots, but now we manage with 1.
---
Then IBS at 51 from av
---
I'm assuming this has to be sarcasm. Unless you've never actually read the tooltip?
---
Well i sort of migrated from firemaw, so I do not know the state before. I can just attest to what people on the discord say (and how much alliance has been whining after the release of p2) ;)
---
Nevertheless you are not wrong. Saw some census on reddit after i wrote it where the split was like pretty much dead even at 11pm yesterday.
---
Your guild's letting you go melee hunter and you're *not* the designated Nightfall bot? Wow
---
Deviate Delight, Grobbulus &amp; Hydraxian Waterlords are RP-PvP Servers.
---
Rhok'Delar, Wyrmthalak &amp; Harbinger of Doom (assuming this is what "Doomsayer" meant, because there is no server named Doomsayer: [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-eu](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-eu) ) are all russian servers and thus not a viable option for the vast majority of eu players. That leaves exactly ONE english PvP server (not rp-pvp) for EU with an alliance-skew of a laughable 51%.
---
And for the US there are 6 alliance-favored pvp (not rp-pvp) servers, some of them heavily influenced by popular streamers (not really a big thing in EU) with a single server outstanding at 63%, compared to 19 horde-favored pvp servers.
---
There are no hyperboles in the numbers he stated, as he stated the exact same numbers from the same source, you just mixed up pvp, rp-pvp and foreign-language servers in the EU to come up with your conclusion.
---
PVE is a waste of time. The lore is horde vs alliance but on PVE servers nobody fights LOOOOL, pseudo realms
---
sounds like overpopulation as a driving factor in addition to the human factor. its like 50% blizz faults for fucking up the logistics(+making it worse with botched transfers) and 50% fault of the community minmaxing honor + abusing blizzard incompetence.
---
Ive played Horde my entire life, i dont switch and FOR SURE dont pay to switch and get a shitty racial, a racial isnt gonna make or break me LOL.
---
Explain to me why is there so man horde in classic then, lets hear your theory.
---
Dot + wand, mind blast/flay as mana allows, shield and renew as required, proc spirit tap.  Spirit tap works off of your spirit, use gear with spirit or have a weapon with crazy spirit to swap to.
---
Priests have one of the easier leveling experiences.
---
This isn't how classic is going to work
---
Systems and mechanics are as they were in 1.12
---
Love it
---
Some websites say 5.5K Alliance vs 7.5K Horde, that's a pretty big difference.
---
Congratulations! Getting a mount is one of those milestones for playing WoW, and is an accomplishment no matter when you got it!
---
I miss the ridiculous wallbangs you could do in 1.6.
---
What
---
Your "proof" is that they did do it, but its totally not their fault because its how Honor works.
---
Making excuses is not proof of innocence.
---
The only mad people here are the alliances LOL
---
Female undead rogue has the best animations of any character no contest, having cannibalize as a melee class makes the downtime close to none amd ive never once looked at my breath in water. WoTF is a bonus. 
---
I also get to break 2 fears as a bonus now that pvp trinkets out.
---
#UNDEAD IS THE MASTERRACE OF CLASSIC
---
Anyone who disagrees is lying to themselves
---
Sumfuras horde player here. Great balance between horde and alliance. Great pvp skirmishes and duels in the open world. Great progressive and competitive guilds to play with/against and an over all decent community.
---
Those signatures are only a smoke screen, Blizzard never needed those signatures for an indication of the popularity of Classic.
---
So you care about not having a shitty racial while saying you dont care about racials?
---
Ironforge.p
---
WS is kind of like hit%
---
The game compares WS vs Mob def 5*lvl
---
 +hit is added as part of this check. 
---
Even if you hit, the mob still has a chance to block/parry the attack. 
---
For 58mobs, if you at 300WS you should be able to hit the mob, it can still block/parry you 😕
---
Selling him ingots at a discount ? XD
---
Winning the eye includes ingots in any sane guild
---
Ya I got the frost one too its clutch

I did not enjoy that part of the game enough to do it again. I want to move forward to experiences that I haven't done before
---
Ah yes, I'm sure it's definitely the same alliance doing both. So did you actually read the rest of the thread where i put down the other idiot saying the same thing or are you being stupid on purpose?
---
You forgot a couple :D in that post, buddy.

Drunken Khara every Saturday at 9am for our crew that was stationed in Iraq....  Such a friggin blast.... Solo healed a few times on my priest, all the way fully faced.... Super great!!
---
&gt;You mean like several warnings to transfer from overcrowded servers or the fact they have opened the transfer at all?
---
You mean to combat que times? All servers are larger than vanilla, minus maybe Flamelash now.
---
Yeap, and is literally the reason why horde is overpopulated. 
---
In retail its even more hillarious, blizzard makes changes to racials, everybody swipe their credit card to play that race, as if the racial is gonna make them good at the game
---
HORDE WINS
---
FATALITY
---
Untill tbc
---
ESO's leveling experience is perfect for the type of people who hate MMOs and really want a single play story-centric game that other people happen to exist in.
---
If only I could find / create premades for korrak's revenge so alliance wins more than 10% of the time
---
Look into "Dude Where's My Mount". I know Guldukat the GM, and it's a relaxed leveling guild, though they are gearing up to raid.
---
Where are they???? Zero pallys in the guild. Checked and the server im on has 4% pallys. Why is no one rolling pally this go around? I checked other servers too and while i didn't check them all the highest i saw was 6%. I thought people fucking loved paladins? They are so helpful in many ways. I thought honor would make the pop grow but its still stagnate. We advertise for holy prot or ret pallys every week. We got one prot pally and he quit already so wtf people.
---
If my guild tried to sell me ingots that dropped in a raid I was in, I would gquit from those greedy fuckers immediately
---
They rolled on a PVP server to play PVP, that doesnt tell the faction balance. Tell me mister delusion how its their fault?
---
Horde or Alliance?  
---
There's a perfect "Jame's Alliance Leveling guide (old version)" that would help you a lot ... if you an Alliance of course :)
---
I can't really say that I can relate. How does it slow it down? I'm sure it does if you lack an addon. But take auctioneer. I search what I'm looking for, and Auctioneer gives me a summary and an offer to buy, picking the cheapest for me first. Does it actually slow down ah in whole? If that's the case, it is almost not noticeable.
---
I think a lot of people forget the best PvP/ PVE racial in the the game. Paladins and playing besides paladins. This is not an original thought of mine but I heard that like 3 weeks ago and I totally agree. Wind fury is really great for PvP, totems one general are good for For all aspects of the game but nothing really compares to paladin healing in PvP.
---
This thread was linked in one of the recent posts discussing the death of the flamelash server
---
Literally this is a reponse to a comment that has 0 ":D" Holy fuck you cant do anything right
---
The websites aren't terribly accurate and that is spread over 2 continents and those numbers change every minute people log off and on.
---
Wow pvp sucks
---
2x vanilla amount? My server had 4600 characters in the pvp ranking pool in the first week of P2 on alliance alone. This week, it went down to ~3200 characters.
---
That's just pvp ranked characters on alliance only on a server, which is 60% horde
---
Looks cool, but TBH Westfall is more dead than the Plague Lands and no heroes can salvage it
---
Mained a Druid in TBC, I second this comment!  Also if they announce TBC "classic" there will be a druid added to my stable very quickly.
---
Ye i tried it, worst PVP MMO ive tried lol
---
Brutal
---
Nobody is blowing up, "kid", I just told you to stop being a dick to people genuinely enjoying the game.
---
Yeah, that will help the queue times a lot if that's the case. They haven't really mentioned anything besides "cross realm" so it's hard to say if there will be battlegroups, if its just totally cross realm across all the servers or some other way of doing it (potentially small groups to keep familiar names?).
---
The numbers are more accurate than your nothing.
---
Except that those numbers say nothing about the people actually PvPing.
---
On Shazzrah EU the pop is supposed to be pretty horde favoured but there's more than enough alliance dominated zones. I'd also go as far as saying that they have more people overall participating in gank squads
---
I could have sworn that my tooltip do🤔
---
Gettin' 1 shot by a multibox mage right as you get off the flightpath at LHC... well, sometimes you just gotta smile and enjoy the experiences WoW gives you.
---
Then res and kill them. 
---
Multiboxers are plagued with macro and technical issues everytime they play (so I have heard on reddit, I do not multibox myself) But generally most multiboxers are just gonna try and 1 shot you with an instant cast. They aren't particuarly skilled players (not taking a dig at multi boxers, just saying), they just have 4-5x the amount of burst dmg.
---
OK. They didn't know they were overpopulated.
---
They did know that camping boats, towns, FPs, instances etc might make people quit or leave. And they did it anyway.
---
How low is your IQ that you believed people would pay money each month to be farmed every time they left a city?
---
I'm sorry, your constant broken English gibbering comments are blurring together.
---
Doesn't even matter if they put PvE server in the same group as PvP servers are there are much more PvP servers in general. There's no way to balance it out.
---
I have leveled to 60 in both P1 and P2. The first time was infinitely better than the second, but ultimately they were very different experiences.
---
In phase one during the first weeks the early leveling zones were more populated and contested. Sometimes it was hard to find mobs, and territorial fights with Horde were common. These were however small engagements, and if there was a fight, it happened mostly because of scarcity of resources like quest loot. As I got higher level, areas started appearing more calm, probably because I leveled quite quickly. I could easily do _all_ quests in Tanaris, Un'Goro, Felwood, Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Winterspring, and Western Plaguelands. I'd occasionally get killed by a lvl 60, but it wasn't bad at all. Hell, I could often AoE mobs farm in these areas.
---
In phase two it felt like leveling areas until STV were almost completely empty. It was very fast to level because all the mobs and bosses were alive all the time. The only challenge was finding groups to do early dungeons and elite quests with. It was a bit lonely, even without layering.
---
When I reached Gadgetzan on my alt it was a different place. I got killed instantly. And it didn't stop. If I stayed still for 10 seconds inside the town I'd get clapped. I'd get chased when I ran out of town. When I reached Un'Goro the flight master was camped. When I ventured out of Marshal's Refuge I got hit by a gank squad of 5 Hordes. I quickly realized that questing there isn't even worth it. Eventually I get to 52 and start doing BRD. Instead of dying 0-3 times on the way there like in phase 1, now it's a minimum of about 7 deaths, even with stealth.
---
Remember, 15 years ago PVE servers were listed as "normal" and PVP was some kind of specialist server type like RP.
---
how pathetic, I don't care about winning or loosing an argument over reddit, especially with people that cannot take some perspective. 
---
It's clear from your obnoxious argument that it's the only thing you care about is winning when it's clearly not the point. 
---
It's also funny that you are dead set for people to give you proof when you don't provide any.
---
&gt;And the next 2 paragraphs were you just swapping to personal attacks when you lost the argument. Well better luck next time.
---
Wtf? That was the main subject of the argument and you derailed it because you were stating shit. Why should I reply and give source to stuff you just imagine? 
---
Iam just off work, see ya never.
---
Discord bot works pretty well imo. We've been using it since start and no issues.
---
&gt;All servers are larger than vanilla
---
I would like you to define "larger" as in "how exactly larger" and give a source please.
---
You have been a redditor for 4 years and you only have 500 karma, maybe people just dont like you or the things that you say you know? Is it worth continuing when people clearly lets you understand that the things you say are unintresting?
---
Fortunately most I run into are Ret and do just about nothing in team fights. Holy paladins are so annoying in group PvP though
---
It uses Warcraft Logs as the source which relies on raiders posting log files.
---
Racials do have an impact even on the low end of the skill ceilings. 
---
Aesthetics are more important with making you invested and immersed in your character. Bone boys for life
---
I'm sorry that was funny as hell to watch.
---
Its in your best intrest to stop deliberatly embarrassing your self, but you do you ;)
---
Nope, never had a feeling that either faction was bigger
---
If its not an all guild run and you need filler, you are kind of screwed. 
---
What ever loot rules were posted must be honored or you will be that guild no one wants to go with cuz you “ninja” loot. 
---
Feel your pain, best if you help recruit for the last bit of dps/healers you need and move to a better system of loot. 
---
How dead is flamelash, and how will blizzard fix this balance problem ? buff alliance or nerf undead&amp; orcs racials?
---
So yeah, it turns out WPVP isn’t that much fun to me***

NOBODY IS FUCKIN SUPRISED. Why cant you get that throught your thick victim skull. Show me a single person that is surpised.
---
How do plan to convince your guild to give you a binding as a hunter?
---
check fight club discord for all the info
---
Thanks a lot 😁
---
This is the correct answer. Unless your guild doesn’t care about debuff slots you should never be using anything other than SS/SnD/evis/instant poison in raids
---
I really doubt such a huge meta shift can be explained with only a few ingame mechanics.
---
I suspect it's a more general shift of the player population away from the classic good vs evil thinking of when we were children toward a more nuanced view of the factions.
---
I chose horde cause grom was my favourite war3 char :\
---
wHaT dOeS iT aLl MeAN?!?
---
Keep it up, you are funny, not in a good way
---
Alliance control BRM a lot during the week. They also often control EPL and WPL and DM.
---
Last night I had to corpse run 9 times to do a HoJ run. 
---
They also have no qualms on killing honorless targets or lowbies. 
---
BGs will kill open world PvP because alliance will have instant queues so they won't be running around.
---
Holy wall of text, anyone have a distilled version?
---
I think all the pallys are on pve servers. Hard time finding groups there as a healer
---
I know you’re probably joking, but in case some other druid are reading, I prefer explain it here: when you have 250 RF, Ragnaros still does around 50% physical damage, and since 250 RF buffed is easy to reach, the Warden staff is still a better mitigation weapon than 30 RF. As mitigation is not really a problem with the 1.12 talents though, I use the gnomeregan weapon that increase 50% attack speed (3 charges, 30 seconds each) to make sure that the DPS can freely max-dps without worry about the aggro.
---
All I am asking for is his opinion on PvP for when he is 48+ because things do change because you are worth honor to 60s. That is all... No need to blow up on me kid
---
Hey, that dead Zhlug is me! Having bad experiences with levelling since the introduction of the honour system (and the mentality of players that comes with it), I had only just logged on a couple of hours before free character transfers would end, and so I quickly transferred to Earthshaker.
---
I decided to take a slow approach when it came to levelling on Classic, rather than rushing to level 60, and up until the honour system I had been enjoying levelling on a PvP server. Random encounters with similarly-levelled players made levelling fun for me and being killed by a level 60 was very rare. But this poorly designed system has made enough players toxic to the point that levelling had become impossible
---
Unfortunately, a lot of levelling buddies I made on the way haven't been able to log on to transfer, so if you're around level 40 on Earthshaker, hit me up!
---
Thanks to the naked gnomes and dwarves of Ironforge whispering me and the people spamming trade chat to warn that the server is dead
---
Despite how fucking amazing they are in group content they just fucking suck ass to play solo so of course nobody plays paladins. Pve content is also easy enough right now that you don't even need the defining factor of alliance raiding to progress. Probably thanks to every guild having fifty mages and warriors now so dps isn't an issue.
---
&gt;  locking out character creation for specific faction
---
you mean pserver shenanigans? no ty
---
I'm one of the few alliance dominated servers. It's a blessing.
---
Do you have that as a warcraftlogs? Would like to take a look.
---
Generalizing is literally the entire point of statistics. There is nothing wrong with generalizing. You just have to try and be accurate and not stary treating an individual differently because of a general statistic (in most cases).
---
Saying that men are physically stronger than women or that women are on average more gentle than men are all generalizations. Doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with it. Matter of fact without generalizing you will never be able to tall about the differences between men and women, because you are talking about in general. There are always exceptions to these things. Obviously. But the point of a generalization is to show how the balance looks.
---
This is why 50 and 40 servers dwindle to nothing
---
Thanks, I was unaware.
---
Excellent!
---
Yep it does, if everyone did like you auctioneer would have yo scan 20-30 pages to load runecloth before you could buy any. The only reason you're not noticing a problem is because veteran player know not to do it.
---
But why is there only 1 tank and not 2?  
---
Because that's whats been done in the past?  
---
I play both healer and tank on my main pally, as well as having an alt dps. I can personally say that as all roles, I actually like having a pseudo offtank in a 5man group.
---
As a tank, I can worry about 3 hard hitting mobs, and let the dps burn down the 4th caster mob. This lets them go as soon as I pull (which they will do anyways), and by the time the dps are done with the first mob, I have enough aggro on the other 3, its really not going to matter. (Well except as a pally tank, its normally just as easy for me to hold all 4.)
---
As a healer, this is often easier, because the mob is hitting someone with decent armor and not hitting me.  And its a hell of a lot better then the mob chasing around the mage or lock who will blink into another group, or fear the mob.
---
I'd love to see more hunters use pets as a form off-tanking/CC on trash packs, especially when a warrior is tanking. It's preferable than having to heal squishy party members being chased by that third mob in the pack.
---
Back in the Day i wanted to play PvE but most of my RL friends gone to a PvP Server, so I started with them. We had Hunters, Rogues and a Feral. I was a Warrior. Leveling was very hard back in the day. I had zero knowledge of core mechanics. I could tank, but that was it. I got farmed by every enemy char in STV. 
---
This time around I picked PvE. It's mainly because I want to decide when I want to PvP.
---
am i the only person that wasnt even aware that free transfers were avaliable?
---
nowhere on the game client did it make me aware of this.
---
nothing in a newsletter, nothing on the maintenance posts.
---
why am i expected to frequent the forums / reddit to get news on something that has now killed off a server.
---
So the world just belongs to alliance now?
---
Sure, but now you're talking more broadly speaking to make generalizations on all servers at once. Admittedly it was hyperbole to say that no data is better than false data ALWAYS, but in the context of "how is server X doing?", THIS data is equal to or less than nothing.
---
If we assume that the proportions of raiders logging is equal, we can safely assume that Ten Storms is a completely dead server to roll horde on. A player that has access to this data would make a worse decision with it, than without it. One could also assume that it's not worth going to Pyrewood Village since it's a very low population server, when in reality it's full.
---
Seeing as these are two instances that points out that the data is clearly VERY incorrect in these instances, and there is nowhere the data is confirmed to be correct, I'd still say that it's wiser to not use the data set at all when making a decision on the state of a given server. And in more general terms, if I (personally) only had access to data that I know for sure is either proven to be not even remotely close to the truth or unknown then I'd conclude that it's better to find another means to an answer. 
---
Then again I'm only using common sense and not any kind of education in the matter so thanks for offering another view of it.
---
Alex Jones is on the case it’ll all be clear soon.
---
You dont need full pvp gear my Dude!
---
BGs make it easy to farm ranks. Casual play can easily get you rank 6 or 7 and also rep with AV for some of the gear. It can be done casually and over the corse of 3-4 weeks with little stress. 
---
If thats not for you, maybe get a group together that is also lacking Pre-BiS or willing to help and dedicate a night to run 2-3 targeted dungeons for  items you need. 
---
Classic is about the grind and if you have little luck, its much more painful.
---
Irritable Bowel Syndrome from AV? Sounds about right.
---
sadly(?) we have gotten much better at debuff management since then and were not logging those first few raids where we had a number of pugs.
---
I'd agree with your list with the exception of LBRS, which needs an asterisk or something. It's a fairly easy dungeon with a mage or group that knows what they're doing, but brutal for others. The ogres with the stacking Rend, the spider room, some large pulls with close adds...it's very unforgiving to some.
---
You can fill the pool with level 1 alts instead of 19, just have to find a feeder and a taker.
---
Westfall.....where the Goretusk's have no livers.
---
Dont forget ZG has a shorter reset as well. 
---
So more chances for gear, if your willing to farm it.
---
Well, maybe William shoulda kept his dick in his pants and you wouldn't have any cause for linguistic dickwaving. 
---
I provided you a cogent answer in another chain and you just started babbling and focusing on the word "surprise" instead of the overall issue of collective responsibility. So you can go ahead and drop the facade now, its clear you just want to have a hissy fit because the time to pay the piper came for the Flamelash Horde.
---
Sorry. If you don't have some inkling by now of how they created this situation by fully committing to a broken system, there is nothing I can do to help you. At this point, a willful failure to comprehend is your problem and yours alone. Have a nice day.
---
France is a lovely country, by the way. My only complaint was that it was chock full of French people.
---
Heard benediction is pretty balanced. But as far as I know there isn't any 60-40 ally servers. They're all either horde majority or Heartseeker
---
YES! HORDE WON! WOOOOOOO
---
I came from Skeram. The ratio is a lot better or Horde just pvp a lot more than alliance did on Skeram. I can go out in the world farm honor and herbs solo and get a few thousand honor in a couple of hours. 
---
On Skeram anytime you saw an alliance there was normally a bunch of horde killing it and camping it. On Heartseeker you do feel outnumbered but if you /who the zones to see who's PvPin it is normally 2:1 ratio at worst and 3:2 normally.
---
Alliance are able to sit in Org though as most people in Org are AFK or never PvP. The only time they really die is when a group ports in to switch zones and get some bonus honor on their way to a new zone.
---
All in all I am glad I made the switch Phase 2 has been a blast with the constant fighting, running away and setting up traps. The only thing that sucks about it is lvling an Alt if your 48 and up you're dead.
---
Did you skip lib and arm ? 
---
I find dungeon grinding more relaxing and can be quicker so it isn't so bad.  I assume your an alliance player ? You  might be able to experience questing in a few months lol
---
lmfao this is great
---
Time wise, raiding actually isn't much of an investment, just a couple hours s week right now. If you only do MC it will always just be a couple hours a week. It's just you have to do those couple hours a week religiously every week. Not much different than farming hand of justice or Savage gladiator chain. The raid drop rates are better than those items, but have more competition.
---
They're RPing in Ironforge?
---
2h is good for cleave fights. For Lucifron, Gehenas, Sulfuron and Marjodomo, I'm using Obsidian Edge Blade, but unless you have a 2h from Rag, you probably better with blues DW on other bosses (Rivenspike/Bone slicing ratchet, or rend's swords with Edgemaster's).
---
Yeah sorry. Used to french acronyms !
---
The phrase is "quote / unquote" and it's used in speech to imply quotations marks that you can just type out in text...
---
Failfish.
---
Rag doesn’t deal any physical damage though - all his attacks and spells (even auto hit) are fire
---
Theres a difference between being ganked and being unable to go in non instances areas. Fuck me a bit of empathy would go a long way.
---
Which means hordes will control every little bit of the map because they don't want to wait for battlegrounds...
---
Where do I say that people shouldn't do it?  Right, I never said that, I am just saying that people should be informed. With that knowledge they can make up their own minds. 
---
I have seen many guildies being burned out by excessive pvp, because they didn't know what they signed up for and once they were half way  they didn't want to stop, because that would mean they would lose all  the 'results' of their hard work so far.  This is known as the sunken cost fallacy.  People continue to do something they don't really want because  they invested a lot in it already.
---
So yes I  will keep warning people.  I am not telling them to do A or B, I am just spreading the information.
---
&gt; raped by guards
---
lol, if only guards did anything
---
The render currently is about 50 yards.
---
Looks good until you zoom in imo
---
The truth that no one is/was willing to except is that WoW Classic will never feel like Vanilla, everyone was in denial when people were saying that up until Classic WoW release. 
---
Times have changed, people have changed. They understand the game better and know how to abuse it. In 2004 everything was brand new, no one had any idea how anything worked. Now we have websites, guides, knowledge and tons of experience with other mmorpgs. 
---
To get back that Vanilla feeling you desperately yearn for is to either get a time machine or wipe everyones memory.
---
Spellcleaving was highly effective during the first month of launch. However, all good players är already 60, so the quality of the groups are shit while levelling now.
---
Completely skipped dungs while levelling my alt because of it
---
Im not sure if the server census are very reliable or not. I considered Faerlina or Herod but they seem to have the same problem.
---
Here's a post I made yesterday on the topic to illustrate the current problem:
---
--------------
---
To illustrate how terrible the render distance is right now, there's [this set of "steps" leading up to Blackrock Mountain in Searing Gorge](https://youtu.be/51G8rqh5GLs?t=63) (timestamp 1:03).  If you stand at the top of these steps and look back down into Searing Gorge, you won't see approaching players render until they're basically at the bottom of these steps.  This is absolutely insane.  When raids approach BRM, it's like they're being launched out a magical portal because they're nearly on top of you by the time they render.
---
This just isn't good enough, man.  At a minimum, this render distance needs to respond to load demands on the server.  If the alternative is crippling lag, then OK, I can live with terrible render distance I suppose.  But having to contend with this render distance all the time is no bueno, dude.  But the time you see an enemy player, you're basically already in range of them.
---
Yeah I don’t get this either. My first 60 ever in Vanilla was an Orc Warrior. I rolled one because I really liked Grom Hellscream’s and Thrall’s stories in WC3.
---
This is still being tested, but it is something like this:
---
High priority (taunts, sunder, warlock vulnerability curses) &gt; Vulnerabilities (Shadow Weaving, Imp Shadow Bolt, ...) &gt; Dots &gt; Trash debuffs (like the non-crit fireball dot)
---
With Winter's Chill seemingly being the Dots group (bug?) instead of with the other vulnerabilities.
---
They said this will never happen
---
Thank you for your answer. 
---
So I think I'll set foot in UBRS as soon as I can and will slowly start making my way into Strat live on the side!
---
I don't believe even that is possible  with vanilla AV.
---
you don't even know what "virtue signalling" means lol
---
For those that just like being assholes, sure. The more you kill a 47, the longer they will take to get to 48 and start granting honor.
---
Stop bringing pugs and recruit so you don't have to roll for loot anymore.
---
Where tf did I say the alliance doesn't do it too? I said pvp is quite balanced except for peak times when Alliance tends to dominate brm.
---
&gt;If you fly to EPL there is a 50/50 chance there is a horde group ganking allys or an ally group ganking hordes
---
You guys have 0 reading comprehension.
---
go BACK to retail?
---
Come on over to Earthfury man we have a great raiding guild and plenty alliance to kill
---
If you are TRUE min maxer - PvE and PvP. You will always choose Alliance. I really don´t know what are you trying to say here. Just uninformed people choose Horde because its OP, but in fact it isn´t.
---
I was implying the Alliance are all but gone now.
---
You can catch up just fine since it literally doesn't matter when you start.  If you get the same standings for the same number of weeks you will end up in exactly the same place whether you started 2 weeks ago, now, or 4 months from now.
---
Absolutely if the only way to Farm honor is out in the world then of course the world becomes a gank fest. 
---
On private servers high level zones are gank fests all the time even with bgs. Can't say what it was like back in the day as i played pve but from the simple fact that they made their server population way too big it was inevitable yes.

---
Looks like these toxic cunts got what they deserved.  fuck'em
---
Deviate Deligth is RP PVP, chill experience with a population of maybe 60-40 favor to Alliance. We need more help at the horde side
---
I dont think its that accurate cause its based on addon no one uses
---
I feel like many of the horde characters are so much more compelling in WC3.
---
Is this right? I’m not a doctor or anything but the stats on this site show more alliance than horde in general and on a lot of servers. I heard me server incendious was like 55/45 horde but I guess I should expect a lot of refugees from other servers when they opened that transfer.
---
Didn't realize having 50% more horde than alliance was "close", lol.
---
Hope someone brings that in yet that counts as a dishonorable kill on his dumbass for camping that town
---
Why not? Seems useful on humanoid mobs to prevent them from running away. And in case pvp happens on pvp server.
---
For those that don't know (like me 5 minutes ago) IBS is Ice Barbed Spear.

---
An incredibly lucky drop is not a farming technique.
---
yen't please
---
Typical, when you get them on their own in a real 1v1 they are always pure ass at pvp. Cant do shit without their 40 man raid group for farming lowbies.
---
Horde on Mograine:   
---
Just got ganked 6 times on my way to DM just this morning.   
---
And this always happends in Feralas. Horde isn't doing any stomping by any means, sometimes Alliance stomp, other times Horde stomps, and sometimes it's a fairly even fight.
---
I have 22 hks total and I am a grunt so doubt it
---
Lol. Comment hidden, opened it up to see what OP had said, must be pretty stupid of offensive.
---
Nah just bants. Reddit downvoted you for this bud? pathetic rly. 
---
Alliance, get some better banter
---
Some addons deduce them from combat log.
---
Wolfs are the best mounts anyway. Don't @me
---
Yup it's completely irrelevant when you start. Only thing that matters is your placement on a week by week basis
---
What OP is saying tho is that the Eye of Arachnida does not give a DHK. He does not have any DHKs under "Today" field.
---
No, a portion of them did it. You have to make a dinction. There is no guilt by association.
---
If you see a Moonkin with Hand of Rag, better believe I'll think twice before trying to gank them; that mofo is a lunatic without limits.
---
You don't, he's just hopping on the hate bandwagon any change he sees
---
&gt;In vanilla I played on a medium/high pop server and there were a handful of guilds who could run MC and clear it.
---
In Vanilla, I played on Stonemaul and was in one of those few guilds that cleared any content. We killed C'Thun 15 times before anyone else on the server even had one.
---
Thanks for the answer man, this looks promising. I think i'll try to stay 31/20 and mainly tank dungeons for pre-bis pieces - losing tactical mastery would indeed be sad:-(
---
I’ve played PvP servers since actual Vanilla. It’s always been organic 1-3v1-3, an occasional guild having some event for fun being larger
---
I play alliance on mirage raceway and it feels great.
---
Haha word. "Highest quality garment I've ever owned" like holy shit dude
---
Wouldn't hold your breath
---
How's spy going to matter at all if you already know they're around?
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com is the most accurate realm info you can get. It's a collection of systematic /who censuses uploaded by the users
---
Noone did this in vanilla. Blizz 15 years ago certainly never planned for people to do this till 60. How is this how it's meant to be played?  
---
It's quirky and pretty cool he did it though.
---
He's playing solo as a warrior, that's the best he can do.
---
It's not.  I've been PvP'ing extensively this week.  It's not 100 yards.
---
wtf when was this?
---
Working on my shadow priest raiding gear right now. Don’t have pre raid bis so in the mean time I can use either Cyclopean Band or Band of Rumination. Cyclopean has a little bit of strength, spirit, int, Stam and spell power, rumination has MP5 and Crit chance. 
---
I know mp5 is better for healers, but I like the improved Crit. And the increase in int and spell power from Cyclopean band feels negligible.
---
Guildies are telling me I’m better off with cyclopean band, what do you all think?
---
The Defias were wronged by the tyrants of Stormwind. They rebuilt that city, and the nobles refused to pay up, funneling their money instead into military expansionism. 
---
&gt;After Stormwind City was razed by the Horde in the First War the Stonemasons Guild, led by Edwin VanCleef, were hired to rebuild it, a massive project which required a small army of engineers and artisans.\[5\] The construction was overseen by the House of Nobles, who accepted the help of many artisans and specialists from across the Eastern Kingdoms. The spirit of restoration, hope, and prosperity struck many who decided to volunteer for the great work. Other laborers considered the opportunity of rebuilding as a lucrative government contract; a chance to prove their craftsmanship and start anew. Eager to forge new lives, these craftsmen traveled to Stormwind, many bringing their families at great expense. After the reconstruction was complete, VanCleef met with the nobles. Lady Katrana Prestor's secret meddlings in the rebuilding of Stormwind City left the nobility unsatisfied with the craftsmanship of the Stonemason Guild; meanwhile, the workers were enraged that the nobility were threatening to withhold payment for honest labor.  
---
&gt;Lady Prestor played both sides, encouraging them to dig in their heels and never compromise until the disagreement escalated into unrest.\[6\] What happened next is somewhat unclear; the nobles claim that VanCleef demanded more money than was originally agreed upon, while the Stonemasons maintain that the nobles refused to pay them the promised amount. However, SI:7 notes that the nobles of Stormwind ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through Elwynn and into Stranglethorn. The massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy and stripped VanCleef and his Stonemasons of their promised rewards.\[7\] What is known for sure is Edwin spoke out, demanding restitution for their works, which outraged the nobles. In response, the Stormwind House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, which, understandably, infuriated VanCleef and the other workers. The Stonemasons started a riot in the newly-rebuilt Stormwind that resulted in the accidental death of Queen Tiffin Wrynn, when a thrown stone hit her in the head. This caused King Varian Wrynn to deal with the rioters more severely, driving the Stonemasons from the city.\[8\]\[9\] Years later, it would be revealed that the black dragon Onyxia, who was a respected member of the Stormwind court under the guise of Katrana Prestor (everyone being oblivious as to what she really was) had manipulated both parties in order to turn them against each other, spreading chaos and division among the kingdom.

As someone who mostly skipped out on TBC and only come back for WotLK where things were completely different, how did TBC improve some of the unplayable(meme) specs? And is there any way to fix classic unbalance purely with itemization, basically just adding some gear that could greatly improve those specs?
---
And his guild is &lt;Overkill&gt;.
---
As I told another gentleman, collective responsibility is a thing.
---
Being a priest and not being able to dispel pallies is going to be a little frustrating for me.

Yea I remember that one, that's by far the longest one.

Because the blood elf racial is unquestionably the best in the game

**Onyxia chain (alliance)**
---
I've been thinking about the last steps in the alliance Onyxia attunement chain.
---
According to the description for the quest "The Dragon's Eye" ( [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=6501](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=6501) ),
---
"\[...\] *you must search the world for a being capable of restoring the power to the Fragment of the Dragon's Eye. The only information you possess about such a being is that they exis*t".
---
There are no other pointers on how to complete the quest.
---
The quest is ultimately completed by talking to Haleh in Winterspring, who can be found in a fairly inaccessible place.
---
In the dawn of vanilla wow, how did people find out how to complete this quest? Like before internet guides etc.
---
The quest description is pretty vague in my opinion.
---
so basically the burning legion
---
He's celebrating OP's level up.
---
It’s beautiful

Get Tank Gear, Threat Gear, and Solo/DPS Gear.  Then mix and match your set to the mobs you face or the difficulty you encounter.  Ill use the Mask of the Unforgiving while dpsing, or doing dungeons, but swap to tanky plate helm for boss fights.
---
My trash rotation is weird. But this is what i do.  I charge. Shield Slam the primary target. Then build to 25 rage and whirlwind. Then ill slam/revenge and tab sunder in between more whirlwinds. 
---
On bosses, i slam, sunder to 5, and revenge.  Then I just keep sunder up and spam heroic strike.
---
I also have 1 point in imp overpower. so when that procs, Ill hit a mob with that. for 5 rage it does a ton of damage.
---
As a horde on another server,  this makes me feel good, the FP campers got what they deserve
---
Many are saying it is closer to 5-10% drop rate.
---
As a shaman, rockbiter is slightly better dmg than windfury (at least while leveling).  If your weapon is subpar then it makes rockbiter even better since its a flat AP increase.  Right now rockbiter makes my weapon hit almost twice as hard because I am using an outdated staff (as elemental).  In dungeons though I still switch to windfury though unless I want to pull agro for some reason.
---
Come over to Mograine bois!
---
You are very very misinformed.
---
Totally agree! I listed it first because most of the mobs are lower level. It's probably the only one I'd be comfortable doing with everyone being around 55-56, so that's a lot of the reason I ranked it low on difficulty. But you're totally right, it's a huge dungeon with lots of different challenges, and things go wrong quick even with a geared group!
---
Not really, sounds like it has belonged to them for awhile
---
It doesn’t seem correct to me but then again it’s hard to know without playing in that realm.
---
This is by far the best way to understand what has happened. Thank you.
---
Wow 2 or a diablo mmo in more realistic gritty graphics I would love!

Wtf really? Just camping low level quest givers for 2 days? That's just next level shit...

Are battlegrounds phase 2?

I dig it, it's super hot. Take your upvote!

i dont care

Paladins are one of the best classes for farming.

And You? Trying to farm up votes on reddit? If you're gonna whine about your faction not pvp'ing I hope you're at least Knight yourself.
---
I am Kindof taking this week off from wpvp will I fall very far behind? I’ve gotten some kills but not like I was  the last few weeks. Currently 50% into rank 5
---
Eh. You can spare 3 points into improved Thorns and get 3 prices of T1 way easier. Add a Naglering, Essence of Flame, maybe that trinket from UBRS if you feel like topping the meters and it’s just not worth it.
---
When you get to 75 thorns damage, another 5 ain’t much.
---
People have invented the "overpopulated servers" thing as a scapegoat then somehow blame Blizzard despite being themselves at fault. Same with faction imbalance.
---
Drop rate is about 5-10%, most likey closer to 5%. I mailed Wowhead about this and their answer was something about it only showing what players upload.

There are some green axes early lvl 50s with 3.8 speed that I used until 60.
---
It is but that's what it's going to be. WoW PvP has always been a frustrating experience at best.
---
Yes, definitely, they were there for pvp but they were nice not to sit in the middle of the duelling area. Although, there *was* one who did it for a while. There's always one...
---
This is irrelevant. If I didn’t want to be on the game I wouldn’t have taken the time to type out why I want to be on the game... congrats you’re redundant twice.
---
He's a guildmate of mine and I can confirm
---
My guild has had some insanely bad luck for a couple of classes, but up until recently Hunters were fked the most.
---
MC on farm - first 5 weeks no leaf, 2 hunter drops /week max with a couple of MC clears where 0 hunter items dropped. 0!  And we have 5 hunters that show up to every raid.
---
Also I have no idea how people got Sulfuras hammers completed a month in, we have got 1 ingot in the past month.
---
Ah my bad, when you said "highest you can get" I thought you meant the general 'you' not the lvl 19 rogue specifically.
---
Best places to look for a new guild (Skeram-Horde)? Server discord? Reddit? WoW forums... (ew)? Jumped in one early on and honestly I just don't really like many of the most active members. A few are alright, but several are semi-toxic manchildren and it kinda makes me not want to interact with them. 
---
Anyway, I have a 60 mage as well as a 36 priest that I level with my wife and her work friend. I was the mage class officer in a mid-core raiding guild for years so I know about some things but I'm, like, a casual old person now or whatever. 
---
I don't really have the schedule to dedicate to consistent raiding, spend most of my "couple hours per day" playing AH commodities or farming gold. I'm not opposed to hopping in a raid once in a while to fill a slot if I'm available, but I'm mostly just looking for some chill adult-ish folks who are having fun bullshitting and running a dungeon once in a while.
---
I don't even play on an EU realm you fucking moron. I've been on Whitemane (NA) since day 1 and will likely remain here for some time. 
---
Are Romanians even people?
---
Because none of them had the stones to start out on a different server? lol The fear of everyone being on the same server was voiced multiple times pre launch and no one did a thing about it
---
That's me with the Barrens. I'm leveling my 4th character so I can stay there longer. Cata sucked butt.
---
I only did Kara in bc. But I did hard mode everything in ulduar wrath and that dumb arena raid, and the first raid in cata. I just don't remember things breaking guilds like twin emps and what not. Maybe it was organizing 40 people. Idk.
---
Found the lowbie ganker.
---
It's hard to keep calm when you are being farmed as a honor livestock wherever you go, sometimes in a very mocking manner. 
---
Since people are frustrated and cannot play the game, they come here to vent.
---
Light house is so underrated! You always have flak’s of oil from collection quests and old murkeye spawns right there!
---
Also light houses are dope
---
The horde bais is largely reversed on PvE servers. A BG group has both PvE and PvP servers so it will result in balanced queues.
---
Yeah I'm with you. Honor is a bad system. We all knew it, but we didn't know just how bad it was. Basically the system worked better 14 years ago when no one understood it. Now that we know everything about it "honor farming", which is completely reasonable and expected, is trash and briefing. 
---
I don't blame horde for how my server is. They are just trying to get PvP gear. Currently you need to be an ass to get R10 or above. Battlegrounds will separate the assholes from the honest PvP grinders.
---
Damn i feel bad i just missed it, gz to everyone who participated ^^
---
For some reason, the counterweight is my favorite part of this
---
Server balance hit 60/40, so every major alliance guild left the server. The remaining guilds saw them leave and decided to close shop too.
---
Let's not pay men for their work, force them to break the law or die of hunger and then call them criminals, put a bounty on their heads and hunt them like dogs. -Stormwind royal management
---
Pretty cool poster though. Amazing work.
---
Ashbringer EU is really good. Amongst the larger servers and very close to 50/50 faction balance. Rerolled there from gehennas and loving it
---
From 1 to talking like the Nazis in 1 hour.
---
If you’re trying to go to a pvp server, no server is healthy for horde.
---
I see, I didn’t say when they drop items did I. I didn’t farm them, just killed them while on the quest. I can’t say either way, all I know is that they do drop elemental  fire.
---
ITS NOT A BALANCE ISSUE. 
---
It's a population issue. Even on a balanced server, you can get ganked to oblivion all the time.
---
if you deep prot, prioritize shield slam, don't use shield block, demo shout or/and thunderclap. Try to keep 20 rage for shield slam. While revenge has highest threat  per 1 rage point ratio, it does generate less threat than shield slam. Usually shield slam is enough to keep aggro for a while.  
---
Mark your targets, this way it's gonna be way easier for you to keep aggro, for a healer to save mana and for dps not to die.  
---
Defense in overrated, especially in 5 men dungeons. 330 is enough to not die every pull, and 350 is enough for UBRS. Hit cap is important, but try to get at least 3% (which is quite easy to get, ring from maraudon, trinket if you are horde, bow from DME or crossbow from LBRS). After that, get crits. Crits &gt; agility&gt; str (tps wise). If you need additional hit, get it on your gloves (Onyxia attune chain gives nice pair of mail gloves with 2% hit, stamina and agility ) or on your boots (there are couple drops in Scholomance with +1%hit) or even better is belt from General Drakkisath, Getting +%hits on other slots while getting your preBIS is not that important. Of course having Lionheart Helm, would solve most of your problems.  but unless you have mage alt to farm or very generous friends to help you with mats, it's gonna be long road to get that helm.
---
&gt; Why is no one rolling pally this go around?
---
It's probably all the groups denying them loot that isn't cloth or spirit gear. People expect paladins to heal mobs to death in the open world or something.
---
what bot is that? so confused
---
theres not a good way .
---
Firemaw/Mograine/Gehennas all seem pretty decent for A/H balance, slight horde favour but not to the point where alliance feel the need to whine on reddit.
---
Can somebody please venmo me 10 cents? I'm literally 10 cents away from being able to buy Pokemon for switch with my venmo card. I didn't account for tax.  @Iamnickjones420
---
-I promise I won't buy weed.
---
Yes, but they're lazy.
---
And now everyone will tell their server is healthiest :D I play Golemagg-EU so it must be the healthiest :D
---
I would say let the horde transfer to heartseeker but it’s NA
---
wouldn't it be super easy to get R14 as an alliance on flamelash now?
---
Considering all they need to do is stand and wait for mobs to kill themselves, that's a pretty accurate description for paladin farming.
---
Nah, the people who's toxic online usually cant even hold eye contact with another person for more then 2 seconds IRL. 
---
I bet, some of the most polite people IRL are giant ass hats online.
---
Why do you play horde then?
---
More kids rolled Fairlena than any other server.
---
Thanks! It was a tonne of fun, we had casters and everything, streaming on twitch. We'll do another one later on. Our hunter Nillé won. I, a mage, got "probed" early on by one of our rogues. It was painful.
---
I'm just glad i rolled one a pve server.
---
I’d say it’s a combination of reasons.  
---
Alliance was the more popular faction back in the original release of WoW so I bet people that originally rolled Alliance 15+ years ago chose Horde for a different experience this time.  
---
Horde has better racials for open world PvP in general.  
---
I think there’s also some sort of sentiment among portions of the playerbase that Blizzard favors the Horde over the Alliance as well (I think this was a sentiment more going into TBC and LK).
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=294779/maximum-wow-classic-realm-capacity-increase
---
They then increased the size of those layers mate.
---
Does Prot fill a decent role in WSG/AB or are you just weighing your team down by lacking damage?
---
Don't know about you, mate, but I can't play 12 hours a day. I have maybe 2-3 hours max. And when I have to spend well over 1 hour of that just corpse running into brm, it is not a matter of whining. It is just don't the way I wanna play the game.
---
I do. Thank you for asking.
---
I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
He has the ony tooth pendant, primarily feral.
---
Compare PvP with having an intercourse.
---
Do you expect to be gangbanged by 20 horny people anytime you wish for some sex?
---
It wasn't in late Vanilla/TBC/early wrath. Soloqueue BGs got you good gear and you rarely  ever faced premades.
---
Is there any add-on or in game function that tracks mail? Like recording who you sent mail to, maybe even what was sent and when?
---
Yeah.. The doesn't always give a skull up thing is more of a pain in the ass factor for people who want to level skinning at level 60.
---
Blizzard handled this so badly it seems almost intentional.
---
I mean he has a point though. The game is set up to make people feel like a resource. The only time his argument is thrown into question is when you talk about the shit heads who spam macros after they 10v1 you. Those people aren't upset about the state of the server, they love it.
---
When bg's come out we'll get a better idea of who cares about farming honor and who just wants to be a shit head and make another human being feel upset.
---
&gt;Almost every server is horde dominated 
---
This is where you are wrong. Almost every PVP server is horde dominated and almost every PVE server is alliance dominated.
---
Blizzard has 2 options: mix PVE and PVP realms into a single battlegroup which will result in a beautiful shitstorm of PVE players being roflstomped likely or separate them and create large queues for horde on pvp realms and alliance on pve realms. The only factor which may affect that is the possibility of most alliance on pve servers being actual pve carebears who don't care about pve at all, be it wPVP (duh) or BG pvp as well.
---
problem with these posts is people will go make horde characters on these ‘balanced’ servers and ruin them. you dumbasses should quit advertising
---
cause croos realms , no  queues  in prime time , maybe some in other timetables.
---
"everytime eye dropped"
---
They locked the doors on us early. Already rerolled PvE and raid logging on Herod.
---
half of your post is saying that blizzard should not listen to the community (particularly, the no changes community), but the other half is saying blizzard should address the concerns of the community by making changes.
---
This would make world pvp worse.
---
In boomkin form with tank gear on. 10/10
---
THANK YOU. If tanks aren't hit as they engage, they might as well be a bad DPS slot.
---
Vanilla server cap was 20k, current server cap is 50k.
---
Problem is, times have changed now. People see things different. People have knowledge they didn’t back than, making it easy for any raiding guild to clear content within the first week of the release, with a lot of guilds clearing it within the first 24 hours.
---
People will farm the shit out of bg’s and be done in 3 days. Bwl will become farmable content done in under 2 hours within the first two weeks of release and than, you’re back to being bored.
---
That's not the point. Paladin players generally can't be arsed to do it for the hours on end it takes to farm enough for HoR for whatever reason. Which is reasonable, but it does mean that they'll most likely pass on it.
---
Shit logic from a shit player. You can't claim that others are playing wrong just because you decide that it's more fun to do inefficient MC in 4 hours than it is to do it in one and a half hours.
---
i found it easier to make dungeon groups when u needed on because of the lack of level restrictions - there were always ppl coming through
---
Describing rolls as unfair is interesting. It's perfectly fair for any given drop, since all the people that can use the gear have an equal chance at winning. Other systems weight the odds to keep people from getting restless.

And i get to scroll "new" without fucking bitch whine.
---
Blizzard really baffles me with their ridiculous decision making.
---
* 70/30 ratio
---
* Opens realm transfer for both factions
---
* Ally leaves in droves leaving the server ratio at an even worse shape
---
* SurprisedPikachu.jpg
---
Alliance you = Victory? So you quitting is a 100% victory for them then.
---
So true, isn't there any solution for this? Even if it's long term
---
For the life it me,  I cannot understand the appeal to playing a pvp server. This seems miserable
---
&gt; Flamelash Horde are just playing World of Craft now...
---
Look at them, they are the carebears now.
---
Only been 60 for two weeks and already bored? That's entirely a personal problem.  There's literally SO MUCH to still be doing for a fresh 60.
---
Username checks out.
---
I get your point but it seems like an unnecessary generalization.
---
Alliance have small pockets of resistance but you guys control the world. We don't form raids to capture org for a couple hours, we raid to capture menethil for a couple hours.
---
gnome mage here aswell - i feel you mate / when rogues have their cds it seems like there is nothing we can do other than to desparately try to survive for what seems an eternity :P
---
According to this census https://wowclassicpopulation.com/ it seems there are slightly more Alliance toons overall than horde. But it also seems that Horde favours PvP more.
---
So really it's hard to tell. We will find out in 4 days I suppose.
---
Seek help.
---
&gt; The community gets classic without changes..
---
Having 2-3-4x the amount of players in the same world is a HUGE change that most people on this subreddit can't seem to grasp. Original realm caps in Vanilla was ~2500-3000. According to https://ironforge.pro/servers many servers has well over 7000 players (Only players who shows up in logs are counted, so the number of players counted is lower than the actual number of players on the server). Stop blaming the #NoChanges people for Blizzards mistake. Every single decision about Classic, either good or bad, is solely Activision Blizzards, and they are accountable for all of  it.
---
Me and my friends missed it too. Cya classic. It was a nice couple of months
---
Ultra mega chicken? No, he is legend!
---
Haha ReTaiL bAd amirght!?
---
Camps people at half health who just rezd.  Wow it sure is unfair to not get any honor for honorless targets!
---
I love these. Definitely going to buy a few and frame them.
---
Ok zoomer.
---
Kromcrush is almost 50/50 censusing 60's only, not sure it's gonna get much better anywhere else.
---
You need 300 active players getting honour points in order to get into the bracket for maximum rank points. It's literally impossible unless that happens.
---
Wont matter they are doing cross realm BG Qs
---
that sentence doesnt make sense
---
Go mining and craft goblin sapper charges. 
---
Most folks have eng and will either chose to only lvl gob or gnome. 
---
Sapper are mist have for any dedicated pvp’er
---
Alch is nice but most of the BiS pots are hard to get and normally loss money for raw mats. 
---
BS is just painful unless you have lion helm (most folks just charge a tip or do it for free now).
---
I want to re-roll on a different server.  I have an alliance character on Skeram with all pre-raid BIS and a few MC pieces but the faction imbalance is such cancer its made me hate playing.  Are there any servers closer to 50/50, preferably pvp, that have an active amount of people still leveling?
---
oh i assumed you were implying im whiny so i should be on alliance. ive played undead since i was 13 y/o and everytime ive ever played on alliance it just feels weird to me. none of the main cities feel like home, always foreign.
---
Found the 14 year old
---
Ah the “I give up” post.
---
Enjoy your dead server.
---
Not at rank 5. It's 20% of your ranked points which at rank 5 you can earn back very quickly. The problem is at the higher ranks where taking a week off sets you back months
---
I'm in a very similar situation choosing between gear but including my bow, boots and shoulders as well. 
---
Once you're hit capped (6% at 305 weap skill, 9% at 300) you then need to juggle a balance between having a solid chunk of +crit while maximising +AP over all else. 
---
It's why items like Cadaverous Armor and Black Dragonscale Shoulderguards become so good once you're hitcapped. Max that AP! 
---
I'm currently running around with Wailing Nightbane Pauldrons because the +14 str is the best +AP I can find!
---
What does it go for? I bought mine for 100g on the AH about a week ago. But that was alliance side, maybe it's more expensive for horde (because of Orc racial).
---
Why avoid dot procs ?
---
I'm with you man. I don't really understand why layering is bad. It's not cross-realm so you still belong and have a reputation on your server. If layering were still in place the general experience of the average player would be a lot less shitty right now.
---
2-3x more people per realm
---
hige faction imbalance due to blizzard announcing servers way to late
---
#NoChanges people stupid :)
---
"No warrior would ever craft heartseeker" 
---
This is enough information at this point. SMH
---
&gt; Not sure if /s
---
Very confused if /s
---
If it isn't it should be. 
---
..but  then everything after the first bit tells me it probably isn't..
---
I used to duel, use the AH, i'd fish a lot off the coast of gadget for pots, i'd farm herbs in felwood, i'd fuck with people in horde starting zones... I was never bored at all, people dont have to be bored they just like you say are needing some sort of carrot which I think must be a younger thing cause I dont need a carrot.
---
So if I raid for a month waiting for mageblade to drop, and you come the fifth week and it drops, and you roll higher...... You deserve that?
---
It is completely fair that the guy waiting patiently, helping the raid, has a higher chance of getting the hat he wants first.
---
Conversely, you could spend your dko at every chance and get gear, and that guy waiting for his one drop will get his satisfaction while you get yours from getting multiple tier pieces or whatever it is
---
And probably also has friends who are so well geared they gave a Hand of Rag to a Boomkin.
---
I have different experience, relevant level 60 content is shut down by honour tax and corpse hops. I just mostly raid log now. The only content available withing a reasonable expectations of gains per hour is honour in macro zergs.
---
The one in Blackrock mountian.
---
PVE
---
I believe people on PVE servers want to PVP, they just want to choose when they PVP. And BG's are perfect for that.     
---
Of course the amount of people participating in BG's from PVE servers will not be as high as the amount from PVP servers, but it will make the faction balance better anyway. I don't expect any drastically long queues on horde side, while alliance will most likely have instant queue.
---
*Speaking from the perspective of a Shaman-main in TBC, so I don't really know too much about other classes, esp. after 12 years* 
---
TBC addressed meme-specs in some clever ways:
---
1st: many specs kinda worked already but ran out of mana too quickly. So they introduced skills &amp; talents to quickly recover mana or give you lots of MP5 (water shield, 10% if INT as MP5, Shamanistic rage)\*
---
2nd: they increased the DMG-output of specs like ELE, ENH, Shadow or gave them really good group-buffs (10% more AP for Melee, Spellcrit-)
---
3rd: they removed the 16 debuff-limit, which keeps some classes from using high DMG-skills (Mortal Strike, Storm Strike, Vampiric Embrace)
---
4th: Itemization also improved and focused more on useful stats (no more STR, AGI &amp; Spirit on Shaman caster gear). 
---
\*they actually overdid it a bit - by the end of TBC raiding, you barely ever ran out of mana with some classes.
---
As for fixing meme-specs with only itemization? I don't see that happening. You'd still be limited by the 16 debuff slots and good DPS-items for underperforming specs would either be also good for "pure" DPS-specs or railroad hybrids into a situation where you can't really choose your gear, because there's a cookie cutter set in each
---
It's Cyrus. Here is the link to the tournament:  [https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/threads/classic-duelling-tournament.8028/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/threads/classic-duelling-tournament.8028/) 
---
If you register, you can keep an eye on it for when we will do another one :)
---
This is what I started doing between jumpruns in DM. Jump take ~8min so after 5 runs I log over to my fishing toon for 20-25min to let dungeon CD reset. 
---
I would suggest you store raw squid for off season sale (as dps food will be harder to get then). 
---
Have 2 alts with capped banks and bags full of squid. Price use to double in the off season in vanilla, see how it does this time around.
---
63/37 all time is what https://wowclassicpopulation.com/ is saying. In game it feels worse than this.
---
I'm on herod horde also and I farm DM pretty constantly.  The trick is to zone into the DM East backdoor which is north east of camp mojacje.  Then you die in there and spirit run to whatever entrance of DM you want to go to.
---
This is my impression as well.
---
pvp is good when done right, blizzard did it wrong simple as that
---
when you have honor and bgs released from day 1 on a balanced server wpvp is great and alot of fun
---
the pvp server ruleset isnt to blame its the current bullshit phase 2 and ratios
---
Congrats, pedophile.
---
I've seen 55-45 ratio or even 47-53. We don't have reliable data, but I can say that the Alliance does fairly well, dominates in lot of zones. Even if there are more Horde players, I think the Horde is more of a PvE oriented (for example, from my guild out of the 40-50, only 10 does PvP, lot of them just raidlogging.)
---
why would it surprise you? If you're spouting the same crap, why would I want to read more of it? :D
---
What is this, an EvE online video?
---
Zoom your camera in so we can actually see something.
---
Who cares crossrealm bg's will be here in 4 days.
---
Pick up a weel gun
---
Spotted the horde player
---
lol kek bur
---
As a warlock(in raids) the vast majority of your damage will be coming from shadowbolt. Which can crit, Which is why crit is good on most warlocks.
---
As a shadow priest, the majority of your damage comes from abilities that cannot crit. So spellpower and mp5 are better for you because they will increase the number of spells you can cast before going oom, and also how hard your spells hit for.
---
So yeah, a mind last crit looks good, and could maybe be okay in PvP for burst. But really for PvE and PvP, you'll do better getting lots of +spell power and mp5.
---
Try a RP PVP server, im on Deviate Deligth an almost 80% of persons are chill, mature persons that know that this is a game and just like to play and hace fun. Trying to find these persons on a PVP server is more hard because the min/max mentality
---
Sounds like you chose servers poorly.
---
I wish more faint hearted betas would have done the same. Can only read about someone crying over getting killed in a video game so often.
---
It's pretty close to exactly what I expected, since I already played it the first time around. That a majority of people would know the content by now doesn't come as a big surprise either.
---
Although Vanilla was never my favorite version of the game, it is sooo much better than current WoW, that there isn't much left of a point to be proven.
---
Now you’re just copying other people’s comments. Pathetic.
---
"I'm right and I won't bother to put in any effort to educate myself because I can't be wrong"  
---
Honestly I feel like you're just arguing to argue at this point. Do you just want some company?
---
Ironic how they always proclaim that so many horde players proclaim pvp servers are the best because of the sense of constant danger.
---
Join a guild that has an actual loot system. But even then yes it takes a lot of time, MC especially since half the loot is pretty bad. We do split raids now so we get more loot, but the second raids loot was terrible this week. DE:d everything except the ragnaros loot.
---
No, it's not.
---
And i know this is a Common thing.
---
But man, looking at forums and Reddit is making me lose Faith in humanity. Especially since most of us are 25+...
---
Yes we know that. The other guys point was if a BG group has 100k ally and 100k horde for argument sake but 90k of the ally are from PvE servers and not much interested in PvP then the population balance won't matter as the active PvP'ers won't be balanced. Meaning longer Qs for horde.
---
At one point during Vanilla, you could stand on the top on the tunnel entrance on Horde side in WSG and hit charge while targeting someone below you, and you'd path basically through the entire building to reach them.
---
What is a better weapon setup for a hit-capped DW human fury warr: 
---
1. Thrash blade MH, Mirah's Song OH
---
2. Mirah's MH, Rend weap OH
---
3. Thrash MH, Rend OH
---
I'm working towards both Rend weapons but no MH drop yet...
---
Cheers!
---
Get wow-pro addon and load the lvl appropriate guide. 
---
End your suffering.
---
I'm getting that right now on the highest rolls, wearing preraid. Highest crit I've had so far was 3300.
---
Mirage Raceway is pretty great, especially for Ally
---
This was a damn beautiful piece. Also I love how theres just a bear in the corner sitting down haha
---
The kind of dude who'll show up to your house at night with a fursuit and a bootleg gun if you gank him.
---
Yeah, and it was pretty miserable before they were added.
---
BGs are already confirmed to be cross-realm. Not sure if they'll still split it up into battle groups, but surely being cross-realm will help a ton as far as camping WPvP areas.
---
Well he is wearing tank gear and that does look like an FR set judging by the shoulders, so that's probably it.
---
Has to be the most expensive piece of FR in the entire game though.
---
Funny part is, horde fucked themselves. No BGs for you :)
---
Wait what? DM East has a backdoor?
---
Someone's seething.
---
Well I use it and have personally uploaded multiple censuses for Sulfuras. It's a collection of systematic /who census of current online players... I dont know how much more accurate you could get. Why not give it a try yourself?
---
Alliance players hail that area and story but I always find it fucking stupid.
---
An entire map and its farms and people a den of pirates and criminals standing right next to the main capital.
---
Just send in the freaking army and kill them all, hell send in the high lvl mobs from the church lol iam sure that is enough
---
Projecting are we?
---
A few yes. Assuming he's not on one of those due to fact he got to 60 is reasonable in my book.
---
Screenshot I took right now : this is 100 yards https://i.imgur.com/1tC3Fki.jpg
---
Gehennas has been slipping in the last few weeks. Sure you can find a zone or two where alliance is competetive from time to time but the run to BRM is horde dominated and is a 20+ corpse run Journey if you don't run with your raid with sapper charges for your weekly raid.
---
Wrong, these Alliances you now see camping and controlling different key locations are the result of the Horde zerging the entire server, so they decided to fight back the same way, give the Horde a taste of their own medicine, so in that sense it is currently not that unbalanced as the Alliance are now more willing to group up and fuck with Hordes, but don't make a mistake about it, Horde is the cause of this mindless zerging pvp, Alliance just decided to fight back eventually.
---
The impact of multi-boxing on a faction’s economy is less than a rounding error.  Multi boxers are a sliver of a sliver of any given servers population.  The lack of understanding of scale is impressive. 
---
Love the perpetuation of the big, bad multi boxer myth though.
---
World pvp is in that state, because realms have more than double-triple population than 2005 had. This is main issue allowed by blizzard.
---
Shoulders are his bis. Disregarding the FR even. It's the armor value and raw stam that makes it one of the best mitigation shoulders for feral.
---
He used his cooldowns to kill you so you camped him for 2 hours?  I don't think your story really justified it man, but you do you.
---
1. Less PvE servers  compared to PvP servers
---
2. Less PvP players on PvE servers
---
I don't think it will make that big a difference to horde queues.
---
Same with addons. Some players UI look like garbage both in funciontality and aesthetics. But it is different right?
---
I would like to frame these (other ones to like northshire abbey) in some big poster frames (personal use ofcourse for in my mancave) . Where can I get the big resolution pictures? Or is this not allowed?
---
You need around 300 players actively getting honour and beeting them to gain rank 14 at some point. If there's no Alliance to kill, how would horde get there?
---
&gt;The community gets classic without changes..
---
And this is where you are wrong.  
---
We've been granted with higher pop. realms, so we got a change... which turned out to be bad...
---
From a gameplay perspective there's absolutely no point in matching premades vs randoms. It's about as good as lvl60's ganking lvl55's.
---
Ideally premades should be matched with premades and receive bonus honor to make it worthwhile.
---
This. So much this.
---
I don't think cross realms will make that big a difference to horde queues.
---
You buy ingots off other guilds. TONS of guilds are clearing MC easily every week so most guilds will just sell off their ingots for 500+ gold to people fortunate enough to get the eye
---
They were just...punctured by our attacks.  The quest giver wanted ones intact! That's all!
---
I still think they could make up the difference with itemization if they get really creative, and well, we actually get a classic+ content too.
---
Take ele shaman in classic. I think their DPS is decent but their biggest downfall is running out of mana in the longer fights. Other casters have more efficient spells, regen mana while casting talents, gems/rubies, Clearcasting, and LifeTap/Evocation. Shamans get nothing close to any of that but what if they got shaman only gear with a set bonus that says "Your lightning bolt critical strikes refund their mana cost and your next lightning bolt cost 0 mana." 
---
That's just a quick idea that could solve the mana issue without breaking other specs like just giving them more mp5, since that would greatly benefit healing too. I think if we just got 1 more 40 man, 20 man, and BG, all with new creative itemization, it could improve a lot. Also, if all imrpovements are done via itemization, then BC could still follow classic+ since their power level would still be easily replaced by greens/blues as the level to 70.
---
&gt; Your example of Ten Storms doesn't even fucking work because from that site I'm seeing 1400 players with a 30A:70H split
---
That kinda points even more to the data being unreliable and not worth using, don't you think? I wonder what it's gonna say tomorrow.
---
Does it? I thought it was on the same weekly reset?
---
Premades unfair should make up about 50% of this bingo, just wait and see 4 more days.
---
Tastes change with age
---
I did not take into account that it happened on the first tick of corruption which I think is a fair point to make and has convinced me that it's ok to include the initial 4% chance.
---
I loved playing classic and if the 10th doesn’t fix things I may reroll to.  Retail has been fun but even though I am on a full server it almost always looks empty.   I think that’s what I really missed about classic the community.
---
in the AH they go from 45g to 180g, there are currently only 2, and I'm a new player, so I don't really know if I should sell for 40g, or should I save it until the price goes up?

I have no idea if it is really a BIS for twinks 19, some people told me, yes, others said there are better ones.

True. But ghost mushrooms aren't worth the effort on my server, and you need at least 1, probably 2 people for jump runs, which can be hard if you're playing off hours.
---
**sad warrior noises*
---
Im just making my own pug and reserving it, Since Im raidleading on my main its not That hard and The droprate is so low no one will think about it
---
Yeh the gnome fetish is real!!
---
Are you ok?
---
100% agree with you. But as always, players in this game look for the edge to beat others. You see it in the gank squads totally out numbering their opposition, premades want to fight randoms, as its much faster honor. Premade v premande can be epic games, but the honor return, as it stands isnt what players want.  
---
Doubt it'll ever change though, to be honest.
---
Hey bud, just making sure you know that you need at least 15 HKs for the week to be counted in the ranking.  It goes up to 25 if a lot of people are participating.
---
Used it for accident selling a set of gloves I wanted to bank. 
---
Item took a few hours to show up in my mailbox but it showed up. 
---
Sorry to hear your having issues.
---
There were quite a few back in the day, but this time around there's going to be so many it will be the only way to do WSG.  Just the way gaming is now.
---
Lariss Pavilion, need the key from the questchain or lockpicking/blacksmith keys to enter
---
lol  
---
there will be a gazilion WSG games, it is the fastest honor farm until AB is out
---
My strategy has been to focus leveling on green quests so I'm generally a few levels higher than other players. Fewer people will mess with you this way and you are less likely to go OOM or almost die, which encourages people to jump you.
---
I also request groups with everyone in an area for a similar quest and will tell them to keep group as long as they want for safety. In a group you can more quickly respond to help each other out should someone get attacked.
---
If you have seen them go at higher prices then i would say wait till it rises abit atleast. But otherwise just do what u feel like man!
---
Right? We went for a tarnished cause our tank is fury/prot. Ended up getting...well everything. Had a pug hunter but cause tank pulled a forors from the book right there we told hunter he can have the chest. He only wanted the ring so tank took that pos even though he has the earthshaker(?) Atleast it looks cool.

You almost made it to the end of the honor-but-no-BG phase. Check the situation in 5 days before re-rolling.
---
I have read that there is always 1 Rank 14 regardless.
---
tank stratholm living side reserving 1st righteous orb?
---
If tanking with a 1 handed weapon + shield, make sure the weapon is fast attack speed (around or below 2.00 is good). That way if you get a miss/dodge/parry, you’ll have another chance at generating rage very quickly.
---
Ohhh okay, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Well if you go full holy you are basically useless outside of raids and even in raids you are spamming literally 1 button until the raid is over.
---
You can go hybrid builds to make it more bearable (like 30/21/0) but generally playing a holy paladin in vanilla is very braindead. PvP makes it a little bit better, but your job will still consist of chasing behind your Warriors trying to get in range to heal them while they slaughter.
---
Bottom line, playing DPS is much more enjoyable :).
---
This. Naps and bedtime are my login hours.
---
I saw in another thread that apparently they did this on purpose because the experience for normal players at the time was that their render distance was this bad. This is one of the things thats so weird about the "no changes" philsophy because this is an anti-qol change that basically fucks casters especially really deeply in a way that makes it impossible to survive any 2v1, even as a warlock, because I get jumped by a popin so fast theres usually no way for me to react fast enough against melee to be able to try and fight on more favorable terms, AND ALL OF THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE ORIGINAL GAME. I hope Blizzard reconsiders because god does this decision suck eggs.
---
3-man DME runs if you can or otherwise sell yourself to tank dungeons for either straight gold/orbs/drops/etc.  Cant really solo farm so anything else would be hoping for luck with open-world mining/herbing.
---
i wonder what the longest horde wsg queue screenshot will say

2h+ is my guess
---
They nobles were influenced by Lady Katrana Prestor (Onyxia in disguise), to further her own goals....to getting rid of the royal family (Wyrnn) and eventually ruling Stormwind.
---
With crossrealm BGs coming next week, that isn't an issue.
---
Thats the best part
---
What is that scrolling combat textcmod?
---
yes. standard sac 1 button warlock build was just spamming SB and getting 10k crits
---
And don't forget the booze you can buy from the vendoring ogre. It's selling 3-4x vendor price at the AH.
---
Doesn't change that the Defias were the wronged party, or that the reason the nobles didn't have money was military expansionism.
---
8 tanks with a taunt 🤣
---
Firstly, there are twice as many PvP realms.
---
Secondly, PvP realms are more populous. Do you know what the top 10 most populated servers in NA are? 9 of them are PvP.
---
I can't understand the seepage into this subreddit either. I get that people are dicks in game beyond the honor incentive but that's a fairly small minority.
---
Meanwhile, we get 10+ posts a day saying huge groups of people are unequivocally assholes, the game is ruined and anyone having a good time is dumb and their good times are soon to be gone.
---
I had so much fun leveling a dwarf 1-15 yesterday while watching a streamer do the same
---
&gt;  Stop blaming the #NoChanges people for Blizzards mistake. Every single decision about Classic, either good or bad, is solely Activision Blizzards, and they are accountable for all of it.
---
This is absolutely stupid.  Several private servers had player counts in the same range as the classic servers and not all of them had these problems.  THe servers which did go to shit had huge faction imbalances which went unaddressed regardless of their total size.  There were private servers with about 2k people but a faction imbalance of 70/30 which went to shit just as bad as classic and shit like Nostalrius which would have 8-12k people during peak times which wasn't this much of a cluster fuck.
---
The raw player count isn't the problem people think it is.  The huge player count is the problem people WANT it to be so they can blame blizzard for changing something because world pvp isn't the great bastion of fun people mythologized it to be.
---
Here is a reality, world pvp wasn't that great in vanilla.  Even in vanilla the Silithus camps and EPL towers were added to try to get people to do more world pvp and they didn't because it was boring after the first couple of days.  People have sold themselves on this idea that vanilla and world pvp was glorious.  THey see videos of private serers having some glorious world pvp and think that is how it was and should be.  What you are seeing on live servers is what happens when there isn't enough Alliance to counter the roaming gank squads.  You can try to blame raw server size all you want, but it isn't the core problem.
---
The problem is a large amount of the #nochanges people had no goddamned idea what they were getting into.  They had this idea of what the game was and couldn't understand it was a product of its time not the game itself.  There is no exploration in classic because it all done.  There is almost no discovery in mechanics.  There isn't a player base just now learning how to play the game.  This is a game that is basically solved.  Almost everyone coming in has pretty sizeable wow experience and a plan on what they wanted to do.
---
Not sure if you meant AV instead of AB(wont be out for a while still) in which case it doesn't hurt as much for AV since you can control the bosses to keep faster kill times.  In WSG you *might* be okay carrying the flag but a druid does it a lot better.  For the most part a prot warrior is worthless in WSG/AB, and at best okay in AV as long as it just 1 or 2 of you.
---
I played Horde originally and went alliance even though I knew Horde racials were superior. (And sadly I went mage instead of warlock because of it). Went this route because I knew everyone else would be going Horde. 
---
That said, my main gripe is PVE related.  Good lord flight paths and overall locations for stuff sucks compared to Horde.  Boats suck compared to zeps.
---
What? The game was played completely different. It took 153 days before somone cleared MC for the first time, unlike now when people did it in the first week with greens and blues. People are geared to the teeth, some more luck than others, and people are farming honour on a larger scale than before because they know what rewards come with the system now.
---
I replaced mine with Stoneslayer from uldaman. Crazy top end damage at level 44.
---
True.
---
Ah so because there's few people who have money to abuse the system that makes it okay.
---
Sure dude
---
I’m aware of that. That’s why they have hearthstones :D
---
My favourite part of these posts are the tough bois that come in complaining about complainers. You know the ones who are on the 70%  side of the faction imbalance. Heres a concept for you absolute donkeys. When you see a post with a title that is about imblalnce, phase 2, etc, etc.....dont. fucking. read. it. I know what a concept. It's such an inconvenience to scroll over a post and not click on it to then go and bitch about people complaining about actual imbalances.
---
ever heard of “SL”
---
RETAIL BAD CLASSIC GOOD!
---
I’ve never tanked before. Currently level 14 Tauren warrior. Can I start RFC at 14 or would it be best to wait a level or two?
---
I don't remember the actual amount, I just chose something low.  I do know I wasn't actually getting credit for the kills while other people in the same group were.
---
I didn't realise you were talking specifically about tanking. But for PvE DPS orc really is head and shoulders above. Not only do you need 3% less hit, you also have a significantly reduced glancing blow penalty. Those two factors are something like. A 10%dps increase which is pretty significant. This doesn't even consider bloodfury.
---
But I agree, the player and gear are far more important than racials in most cases.
---
It really isn’t bad for a 2h fury warrior if you’re an orc. The weapon speed matters much less for fury since Bloodthirst scales based off of attack power and you’re only top end damage scaling ability is whirlwind.
---
&gt;Anonymity on the internet brings out some of the darkest personalities
---
Ah yes, the John Gabriel greater internet fuckwad theory.
---
&gt;"This allowed us to accommodate more players per layer, which means fewer layers required per realm."
---
This is why I said 
---
&gt;However, I won't argue they have been slowly increasing the size of 1 layer with each delayering. This is exactly why 1 layer CAP at launch was around 3k concurrent and now it's around 6-7k CAP concurrent. Which, again, is filled on a very small amount of realms.
---
Yes, that's correct, they have been increasing it but up to a certain limit.
---
&gt;We have realms that still reflect medium populations during peak times which is nearly double vanilla size.
---
Like what exact realm? Be more specific.
---
Pretty sure Quel is Main Hand only.
---
Fuck, that’s a throwback to vanilla.  PAA alliance member, now I have to go back and read penny-arcade in its entirety.
---
Whiners gonna whine is all.  
---
Lot of us knew what was coming, braced ourselves and have almost finished weathering the storm.   
---
Next up is people whining about getting creamed by premades. There are gonna be pleb premades complaining about better premades creaming them, too. Stay tuned.
---
Look at all those horde flairs rationalising lmfao
---
Nah shoulders are the only FR thing he has besides hand of rag. It's just normal tank set.
---
It looks more like 55/45 for alliance.
---
Not particularly but give someone in Reforged a shout some time.
---
QS is MH only though
---
Don’t take this dumb “honor per hour” mentality into AV. That completely ruins the match. Some of the best AVs I’ve ever played were back-and-forth turtles where one side finally got a couple lucky breaks, pushed through, and won.
---
Turtles in WSG are much harder to overcome than AV.
---
50% more is literally impossible odds. Especially when it means over a thousand more players. This is the issue no one is fucking understanding. 3vs2 is easily overcome, 600 vs 400 isnt. There is no play that saves that.
---
I just punch the hooker to vent.
---
I was very surprised at how easy UBRS was when I first went on my tank. I remembered it being way harder, but with everyone doing &gt;50% more DPS than they used to, stuff just doesn't live long enough to be a problem. This is made most obvious during the Rend fight, where I distinctly remember (back in Vanilla) having to aggro mobs coming through the gate before the previous wave had been fully cleared. Now in Classic you're waiting 20-30 seconds after each wave for the next one. 
---
As for the difficulty listing, some of them are kinda too close to call, but I'd say, easiest to hardest: LBRS -&gt; DM:E -&gt; UBRS -&gt; DM:N -&gt;  Strat UD/DM:W -&gt; Strat Live -&gt;Scholo. 
---
Special mention for the Strat UD final boss though (Baron?) if you don't have decent AoE.
---
Repost
---
Bringing up statistics about WOW to make a generalization about BEHAVIOR of griefers?  Are you fucking stupid?  Instead of grasping at nothing and trying to correlate unlike things just learn to PvP dude.
---
Same here. Did engage a really nice 1v2 yesterday, only to get the 3 remaining mages pop out of nowhere right in face :(
---
Alright, thanks anyways.
---
No 3 day reset
---
In the default settings, you can disable nameplate overlap and have them stack.  If that still doesn't completely work for you, check out something like Kui Nameplates or some of the others that are out there that put arrows on the targeted mob.
---
The horde will camp the battlemasters lol
---
Server types have ALWAYS been mixed in battlegroups.
---
The longer Q’s mean I can just go kill some questers in the mean time and get a free hearth back to org after the BG
---
This is awesome! Almost like the cover of a mid 90s RPG game for Windows 95, I love it. 
---
Side note: sometime back (around launch I think) someone posted some "vintage travel poster" style art for a bunch of different zones (one in particular I think was either STV or Un'Goro with the tagline "Adventure Awaits!") and I cannot for the life of me find it again. I was really hoping it was you, but I checked your history but can't find it. Ring any bells?
---
And that's what people meant when they were getting nostalgic about world pvp. Back then it *was* more fun because everyone was new and learning about the game and not necessarily trying to exploit every bit of a totally known-and-theorycrafted system for "progression". Hillsbrad always had some combat going on because there is a big open field right between opposing major quest hubs, but most wPvP was just people alone or in small groups *doing other things* and then happening to run into people from the other faction over a rich thorium vein or farming area.
---

---
I went the route of strat live tanking. I reserve the first orb, and I was able to get my epic mount after about 20ish runs. During those runs, I actually ended up winning the flask twice, the truefaith pattern once, and then engineering shadow reflector twice. The drops in there are great money makers, and once you learn all the pulls it goes fairly quick.
---
Starting next week they will have cross server battlegrounds either way, they're getting their BiS PvE server in the end it would seem.
---
What do you own, the world?  How do you own disorder, disorder.
---
The westfall storyline never really completely made sense. I get that there was some unnamed greedy nobility that screwed over VC, but why hasnt bolvar or someone else stepped in and just paid them?
---
thank you for the nice analogy
---
Ummm , aren't bgs cross server?
---
What is a hunter without his prey? :) RIP
---
Yup
---
You still have questers on your server.
---
Yeah, Hand of Rag is definitely a "who is willing to spend 5000g" sort of item.  Not exactly a hot ticket item.  Most people only want it for nostalgia or to fulfill old dreams, not because it's particularly great.
---
Of course there's a druid willing to do it for the memes and a guild supportive of that choice.
---
I use 3 pummelers on Rag and fury warriors still end up pulling at like 5%
---
I'm literally encouraging the opposite of whining.
---
At what point is the server balance acceptable to you?
---
Back then we were young boys craving grown women. Now we are grown men that want... oh wait.
---
There is some blame to be placed on blizzard. Maybe not relevant here, i play pve because PvP servers sound miserable, but we are massively over populated.
---
Blizzard allowed WAY too many accounts onto each realm. 
---
That is on them.
---
Not sure if that is part of the problem on PvP servers or not though
---
Perdition's Blade and Corehound Tooth is tanking BIS.
---
Hey, it would be "affect" in this context. :)
---
I don't think you necessarily need a mage, honestly, a healing priest with holy nova can take out the aoe room easy plus you have shackle.  You def. want at least one interrupt (rogue, mage, etc.).  The best tank I have had in scholo was a bear, they are very solid at holding multi-aggro.  Enjoy!
---
It has good dps but it will make your heroicstrike+offhand toggle macro harder to execute since the speed difference between your MH and OH will give you a smaller window than if you were using a 2.8 MH and a 1.5 OH.
---
(If you don't know what the toggle is, you can pretty much guarantee your offhand never misses by queuing up HeroicStrike/Cleave and cancelling it right before your main hand swings)
---
I promise I absolutely won’t. I plan on taking the mines to prep ground strike forces and trying to summon the frostlord. 
---
But many people will. So be prepared.
---
appreciate it.. not many people would state they were wrong, so kudos for that
---
I would say the best way is to do DM tribute runs since it keeps you our from the world pvp. To be fair, dont expect it to be super easy the first times. Get engineering to 200 skill (cost around 50-80g) so you can make Large seaforium charges and buy lesser invisibility potion (or invisibility potion for 3 extra seconds). Respecc to improved FD is reccomended. I wiped around 5 times before i understood the mecanics, but do a run in about 18-20 minutes now. Each run will be 20-35 g in vendor trash + around 5-18 g in potions (depending on your luck). Feel free to ask me any questions if you need help :) And GL on the epic mount!
---
I only felt it was greedy when the tank rolled and won the second orb after we passed him the first.
---
20 mans are on a 3 day reset
---
Honestly all it will do is boost q4 revenue, theyll do it. Its about making money NOW, who cares about the future? Thats capitalism baby, infinite, unlimited growth
---
Horde on Horde-dominated servers are not to blame. Alliance on Alliance-dominated servers are not to blame. The players are playing the systems. Could excessive FP and boat campers have been given warnings for unsporting behavior? Sure.
---
Anger at other players aside, we ultimately all know who the culprit is: Blizzard. They had tons of data and game history and years of toxic behavior on private servers that should have rung alarm bells all over their offices: Servers and communities are going to die if we don't intervene to promote faction balance. The list of Blizzard's failures with the Classic launch - a game we have all been waiting for for years - keeps growing. It just makes me sad and disappointed.
---
Meanwhile &lt;Waste Management&gt; on Alliance stopped complaining and started camping the bottom of Blackrock Mountain and has camped my ass getting to BRD the last two nights.
---
easily doable me and two friends 3 manned rfc at 15. just make sure your team targets your target. 
---
you have a limited kit to work with and your dps need to understand that.
---
Great work!
---
Mmm yes photoshop, saw it with my own eyes. but photoshop idd.
---
I didn't say nothing about acceptable. Discussing things with people like you is insufferable lol. On the ignore list you go
---
Honestly for something like this (rolling a character in a game), I'd be pretty okay with making a simple of assumption like IF/WoLogs is only capturing 20% of the total players, extrapolating that to get a number in mind, and maybe making a Lv1 character to check out how busy IF/SW/UC/Org are at primetime.
---
What I don't think your suggestion factors in is just how much Blizzard allowing players to do realm transfers can screw things up.  You can make a fair guesstimate for player loss due to fatigue, but transfers can cause massive swings and Horde outnumber Alliance on most realms.
---
If what we're hearing about Flamelash is true (with most of the big Alliance Guilds transferring off) then I think IF over the last 2 weeks will be way more accurate than data across an entire phase.
---
You truly are a dreary cunt lol of course we have questers
---
Counterweight is the best weapon enchant ferals can get right now.
---
This thread surely helped me to fill with the twinks, druid travel form, at some point I expect "using consumables and engineering on bg is unfair" from trolls but my main goal was to emphasis the most common complaint slapped on top of every other one.
---
"I waited for 2h then lost to a premade in 10mins" or so.
---
Hit me up and I’ll start a toon with you.  I’m on PVE now though
---
&gt;what they deserve
---
A free transfer to a nicely balanced server with 5 times as much PvP? Yes thank you :)
---
calling bullshit on your "for 6 hours" you can corpse hop closer and closer to either Booty Bay or Grom'Gol while running some distance towards them before being killed again.  Once you are close enough, the guards will help out.  I have done this before myself.
---
You get 0 honor for going 0-3 against a premade in WSG though. Its literally a complete waste of time.
---
I would laugh so hard if they did that. They won’t but I would love watching those Horde Snowflakes meltdown. Lol
---
As it always is
---
I’ve accomplished more than I could have hoped. Epic mount done, lionheart helm and chromatic breastplate crafted, guild clears content weekly.
---
hahaha census ....stop link this shit
---
Thanks! I usually can attend my guild's raids but sometimes work makes it less possible so being able to get familiar with a dad guild is interesting to say the least.
---
BEST meme build I've ever seen one
---
I suspect WSG will become exclusively premades. You get 0 honor for going 0-3, so if premades reach a certain popularity threshold then there is no reason for pugs to queue up.
---
#NOCHANGES
---
Did they say the only play during prime time? No they said flightpaths are camped 24/7. A spurious claim backed by their experiences. You only have to look at the shifting control of important areas during prime time to see that the balance is pretty close. LHC constantly shifts between horde and alliance control and if we're taking anecdotal data as significant I have landed more often to alliance gankers than horde friends. TP is always a coin flip. The other night horde controlled searing gorge entrance to BRM and Alliance controlled the entrance to BRS. You think that situation can exist on an imbalanced server? Anyone complaining about Incendius being imbalanced either doesn't play on that server and are talking out their ass or biased by their bad luck and poor experience.
---
Noob question. How do raid lockouts work? I did MC for the first time this past tuesday.  Am I like, physically not able to re-ente before the raid resetsr? Or is it that I just can't receive loot?
---
Some people just want to see the world burn
---
Harsh lol it was meant as hyperbole.
---
In two weeks I'm going to be posting
---
&gt; cRoSS rEalM qUeUeS mAkE qUeUe TiMeS eQuAl
---
and laughing. It's not going to be true for every battle group because there aren't enough alliance-dominated servers to balance out the horde-dominated servers. *Especially* once PVE-focused alliance on PVE servers get AV exalted and stop queuing altogether.
---
Hahahahaha spot on! I already picked few. Damn AV bridge, it’s Blizzards fault!
---
Couldn’t the single remaining alliance Rogue hit Grand Marshall in 12 weeks easily? Tho? Sign me up for that then I’ll transfer off when paid transfers come, or when blizzard merges the server sometime.
---
&gt;The other guy you've been talking to has been providing plenty of evidence.
---
So have I, especially since all census data supports my point. Nice ad hominem though.
---
Yes, it has always been a noun and a verb.
---
Yeah, servers like Flamelash are beyond the point of redemption, but if the Alliance is just going to give up as soon as the balance tips to 60/40 they shouldn't be playing a PVP server in the first place. Vanilla PVP was never balanced to begin with. Expecting a 2004 video game to suddenly conform to 2019 standards is lunacy. The best you can do is fight against the odds and try to prevail. It happens. It just requires actual effort.
---
I don't get how only body pulling with your pet makes it so both ogres won't have a weird aggro table for the entire fight. How does it have an impact after you take back aggro for the first time? 5/8 aura should affect them, right?
---
I mean I believe you, I just don't see how it work mechanically. Genuinely asking ;)
---
Don’t think anyone doubts the top private server guilds will clear it in no time. The average guild on the other hand I’m a little more curious to see :) gonna be fun nonetheless!
---
Because it's pretty useless for a druid. Druids get no benefits from high dps weapons or weapon procs.
---
Very likely it will be mixed.
---
I've never heard of toggling actually,  that is new to me.  How do you cancel before mh swings?
---
Well in PvE thst still makes paladins better than shamans, who are good in 1 of their 2 roles.
---
&gt; . If premades are matching with a lot of pugs and steam rolling them than wsg will be better no matter what faction you are.
---
For PUGs, getting steamrolled in AV at least gives some honor. Getting steamrolled in WSG gives you nothing.
---
I don't see why pugs would go to WSG unless its a bonus weekend.
---
It's more about group composition than the difficulty of the dungeon. LBRS is super easy for me as a resto druid healer with the right group. I ran it last night with a group that had nearly no AoE, the spider room was brutal and took us an extra 5 minutes to clear.
---
A melee Hunter would use nightfall over TF. If you actually take TF on a hunter you're being a complete dick. I really hope no one joins your raid or that when you take that first binding you get black listed
---
For the lawlz basically.
---
Two more words: gnome mage
---
My friends and I have discussed this at length. We agree that it's part of the reason that warcraft has such large replayability even to this day. Cartoony graphics just age better.
---
It better be. Its the only hope the game has at this point, however faint.
---
As DW fury, when will HoJ no longer be one of two BIS trinkets?  Naxx? HoJ seems to out scale even AQ trinkets
---
I’ve seen differing info about this online so far, so what are the hit/weapon skill recommendations for pvp? 
---
If I’m pvping in raid spec (DW fury warrior) is it beneficial to have any amount of hit/weapon skill? 
---
My plan was to stay fury specced, but use demonshear is BGs, which has been going pretty well in open world combat, but yesterday I got Deathbringer and it’s damage range isn’t too much lower than Demonshear, so I figured it’s more worth it keep dual wielding w/ a fast OH. I haven’t gotten the chance to try it out too much yet though. But now I’m wondering about weapon skill/hit for dual wield pvp combat.
---
I definitely feel the same. The "realistic" style of many MMOs blends together. Lots of browns and greens. Aesthetically, I enjoy the hand painted style wow employs. Sure, it's low poly and what not, because of the era and technical limitations, but the style itself is nice.
---
Yeah but it still causes them to die, If me and warrior don't rotate taunts during execute.
---
Or roll on a PvE server, it makes playing way more enjoyable when you can opt into PvP
---
Get into a guild where they will give you alot of highly sought after gear your class would normally not get and piss off alot of people in the process and you can make anything work.
---
Probably because harming innocent people is not an appropriate response to an injustice done to you. I always felt that the "VC did nothing wrong" argument is a little disingenuous for that reason. His response to a lack of payment was to start robbing and killing people...
---
Think the correct spelling you were looking for was "raptor".
---
You know you just have to check out alliance dominated servers to see that dickery isn’t faction-specific, right?
---
My thoughts exactly. I find Nightfin to be a lot better, both in terms of ganking frequency and profit, but I feel like Squid will be worth a lot come Summer. Staying up from 12am to 6am is definitely a struggle though.
---
8pm on herod
---
Well that settles it, time for us all to roll dwarves on Flamelash, form the guild "Baruk Khazad! Khazad ai menu", and retake the city.
---
&gt; There is literally no way to create an incentive for two rival factions that does not punish the other.
---
Exactly, that's why I'm opposed to such incentives.
---
&gt; If they give the minority Buffs, that’s a relative punishment to the other side and they will cry all the same as the minority who are being punished right now.
---
Why would they do that?
---
&gt; There is no path towards faction balance that does not remediate the advantage gained by being a majority faction through some kind of loss - absolute or relative.
---
Of course there's not. nearly 60% of the players play Horde on US PvP servers, the only way to "balance" things out would be to force (or at least enable) faction transfers, and cross your fingers that enough people will willingly go from a dominating faction to a dominated one. I guess it could happen if BG queues are unbearably long for Horde, but I doubt it would be enough to make much of a difference, should Blizzard even decide to enable factions transfers.
---
&gt; You’re enjoying a benefit due to the imbalance, so you should also suffer a consequence. That’s how things even out in aggregate.
---
What is the benefit of imbalance? Not getting ganked as often? Anything else?
---
But then, the consequences of imbalance already exist, like farming materials is nearly impossible when every decent spawn is camped 24/7 by people you can't attack, since they're from your own faction. It also means the demand is higher than supply, so not only is it harder to farm, but it's also more expensive to buy stuff on the AH.
---
Another consequence is how stale wPvP is. I'm sure a lot of morons (let's call them what they are...) are very happy farming HKs against people who are not in a position to fight back and camping them all the way from TP to MC, or from DWM to Ony, or in front of every instance entrance there is, but where's the fun in that, really?
---
Another consequence of imbalance will also become evident to Horde players in 4 days, when BGs are released and they have to wait a longer time than Alliance to get into BGs.
---
Here is an arrangement myself and a tank in our guild have. We do DME jump runs. I am a lock with all pre-bis but 1 slot (I am just unlucky in 5 weeks of raiding I have only won a mageblade but no other gear). He is pretty geared. We do DME jump runs with just us 2. You may be able to do the same with a lock in your guild. This is essentially the lock solo DME route with a few changes we made. In total we can get 3-4 runs per hour if things go smooth but only count on 2-3. With this we have gotten a couple dozen class books, including 1 Fors. Here is what we do.
---
At the start of the dungeon I use my eye to scout the first two book locations to see if we need to route to them. We make our way to hydrospawn, kill lash and hellcaller pack for safety then use LoS and DoTs on boss. 50% health warrior starts to auto-attack as he will not be able to take threat from me at that point. 
---
Make our way to Zevrim, kill hellcaller pack for extra loot warrior goes back to hydrospawn pool and just sits in the corner to wait for me. I solo the boss using LoS in hydrospawn pool. If I get in trouble warrior will jump in but otherwise all me.
---
Make our way to final boss, kill lash packs then head back up top. Both jump on pillar. If there is a book spawn I jump down and use LoS to get book before fight and not pull. After book I doom boss and juggle. After the first doom warrior jumps down and auto-attacks as I juggle, again I keep aggro the whole time. Usually I get mana burnt at some point and it is just a slow fight so either stam or health on rejuv for me. Once imps come warrior backs off and we LoS in sync for the most part while I try to get DoTs (siphon life) on imps. Whenever I can I DoT boss with agony or doom and imps with siphon. Once boss is down warrior goes back in and we clean up imps then mine and reset.
---
Vanilla PvP was never balancer around 10k population caps nor the meta of swarming around in macro zergs. Take that into account. Blizzard has already made huge critical changes from the start!
---
Yeah, I checked that above guys log, and I was like "Yep, totally in a whole different league from us". Ah, but those 4 deaths were worth it to absolutely destroy him, no? :)
---
My group needs to get more efficient at trash packs. Were still around 120 min for a full clear, despite destroying bosses, because of trash. I heard that having a hunter mark up the next pack and pull it for the tanks is a great way to speed it up, so I'll talk to our hunters. Also maybe I can get our healers to have a "drinking" rotation, so they don't all drink at the same time.
---
For dw fury? U missing out big ww crits, and hs crits other than that it’s fine. Reason u dont see a lot of dw dagger warriors is because most warriors are orc or human, orc use axe, human use sword, plus if you roll on dagger, u gonna make ur rogues and tanks really mad, so.....just use axe and sword
---
Wow! I LOVE Westfall, the music, the atmosphere, the quests everything and this really brings everything back!
---
If we assume max weapon skill for your level, you have a 5% miss rate against same level mobs. This decreases by .5%/level. So if you are 4 levels above the mob, you will need 3% hit to get to the hit cap.
---
For these numbers, adding 5 wep skill as equivalent to leveling up. Note: it works slightly differently when the mobs are above your level.
---
The stats showed it never has worked and thats why its gone in retail.
---
The gear is distributed unfairly no matter how noble you think you are.
---
And let's be honest, vice versa
---
I’m here dreaming w ya
---
so tell me this mr know it all. what changes were you proposing BEFORE release that would have fixed this problem? because the majority of the #nochanges group was about adding stupid stuff like transmog and changing talent trees. no one was proposing anything that would have addressed this problem we have right now, so again, take that bs and go somewhere with it
---
Apology accepted!
---
So far I can see this is correct. You just need to go invi in cat form or use minor invi potion.
---
Nice save.
---
And why are they lurking on the classic forums
---
When i was tanking i would do strat UD runs with boxes reserved, no cares about them and i just said i used holy water for threat (which is true). The boxes have like 2-5 gold value in greys/potions/scrolls(sell them on the AH! They actually sell). 
---
Will net you anywhere from 10-30 gold per run on top of the other things you loot. It’s not the best but to me, a lot more fun. Especially once you have some ‘regulars’ or friends that like coming along.
---
 If I was a whiny bitch who has 3 hours to play and is bad at pvpat least I would be redeemed by the fact that I'm smart enough to know pvp is a bad idea. But yeah you got the trifecta buddy. Good job you fit right in here on reddit. Maybe you should quit wow and just stay here.
---
In my case, you gave me the piece of information I needed without knowing so haha. You sir are the real MVP!
---
I didn't even think about joining the classic hunter discord... I sure will!
---
In 15 years I've not once thought of this. 
---
I'll see myself out.
---
I'll agree when it comes to BRM. Ever since the horde guilds united BRM has been a cakewalk.
---
He's in full bear gear, I imagine he went balance for the memes
---
blizz has done a good job so far at fixing things that NEEDED it, so im hoping they also prioritize solos vs solo and premades vs premades, as well as add penalties like 30min que timer for dodging then 1hour the second time etc. i think it in vanilla it was like 15min dodge timer but thats not enough.
---
I leveled with 2h Arms. You first take 5% crit from fury and then go for rend (for deep wounds later). You use rend only until lvl 30~ and certainly not after 40 where you respec to either go full fury or full arms (respec to get insta ms).
---
Dual wield is not optimal as you get no hit gear till lvl 55. There are also very nice 2h weapons like the staff of westfall, the whirlwind axe or the ond from uldaman. Start running brd asap.
---
You normally don’t use cleave as you want to fight one mob at a time. Charge, battleshout, rend, overpower if possible, sunder. Heroic Strike is good if you dual wield - the offhand will hit the target when it‘s queued but won’t consume the strike.
---
Yes, a shield is enough to tank. After lvl 50 you collect a 2. defensive set but being tank skilled is not necessary in Dungeons - only UBRS could be harder. No addons needed - I like to have weapon swingtimer.
---
This is absolutely stunning, the cobblestone pathways are incredibly detailed,  the lighting, the water reflection, the sky. Thank you for sharing :)!!!!!
---
Ultimate power move
---
I hear this a lot, but you can't just keep scaling the numbers...
---
Naxx was already stretching the limits of the wow combat model, having to debuff players when they were inside just to fix some of the mess from increasing the power of items.
---
That was why they bumped it to TBC, and it was a great first raid for that expac, and on reflection I think it was smart to both have the first raid of an expac be a 10-man, and also for it to be Karazhan which always features in the lists of best raids ever made.
---
I'm honestly surprised, my server has a decent number of people leveling in the 40s, I'd expect to see more. But I've run an auction add-on since I started 2 months ago, scan a couple times a day, and have never recorded one.
---
going from  5v1 death squad / flight path campign to a 10v10 who may be premade VS against is one heck of a improved when it comes to fairness.
---
of course, we could have a ranked system where premade go against eachother in some kind of brackets... but you'd have to play retail for that.
---
Elixir of demonslaying
---
Try a fresh install. Should fix it.
---
On a scale of “just what I was hoping for” to “disappointing waste of my time and money”, I’m somewhat in the middle of not leaning towards disappointment. 
---
Ive mained hunter throughout all my wow experience, and mostly played in vanilla and then again in legion. All my best memories of wow have been because of the community. In vanilla I made life long friends who I am still in touch with if not actively playing with. In legion I was a officer and later GM of a guild who knew how to have fun and was up for anything, almost especially things that were not directly related to game progression. 
---
Now this could be my server but I haven’t quite found that point of community. When I joined there was a choice to make between legion friends and vanilla friends. When the legion guild didn’t have a concise direction with moving as a unit my choice was basically made for me. 
---
In general I find that even though we all seemed to come back to classic for the same reasons most people haven’t been making that a priority in game. The retail mindset has seemed to weep through into classic. I never hit 60 in vanilla because I was too busy goofing off and I was fine with it. In classic it was no problem to reach those goals... and this time I had to reach them. Not because I personally care but because no one wants to just hang back and play around, but because everyone’s rushing and pushing to hit end game and leaving the low levels out (unless I’m a mage, tank/heals, which I am not). I’m more focused on money, people come online to farm for fake money before or after they’ve come away from farming for real money. I don’t remember the pvp mobs being like this, but maybe because there were battlegrounds when I joined vanilla.
---
I like that I know my stuff better with my class. I’m older, wiser and better equipped. Everyone is. But unfortunately it’s seemed to come at the cost of the child like wonder and playful community vanilla had. I still am having fun, it’s just not the same.
---
It very easily could be
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes - and I say that as a DPS Warrior
---
Aaaah, the delusionnal ramblings of a fool.
---
go on.
---
Weapon skill dont matter at all in PvP. And Im pretty confident the hit cap in PvP is 5% hit (atleast for 1handers). I think its the same for 2handers. And personally I would Always go 2h arms build in group PvP as a warrior.
---
Can you give me an advice on if I should keep the enchanting shards or sell them now ? I'm sitting on a lot of Greater eternal essences and large brilliant shards . Will the price of them change anyhow with the upcoming phases ? Thanks for the prediction
---
Congrats, you do deserve it!
---
I knew that cross faction communication was against the rules, but I didn’t think that meant yelling in game. I thought that meant talking with old players apps like Discord or something. 
---
And if you got punished for spam chat like that because of cross section communication it would probably just be because of griefing and being annoying. But idk
---
Most people irl dont spew their stupidity at me with a platform as powerful as the internet.
---
I think bgs will do a lot to fix it honestly. It won't be efficient to farm honor through wpvp where you have to search for targets, additionally the cross realm component will make diminishing returns less of a problem. Wpvp should hopefully go back to the way it was.
---
Layering and transfers.  On Skeram while leveling it wasn't unusual for me to run around stv and be surrounded by alliance in my layer.  Still kind of had an idea that it was horde favored but it wasn't super noticeable especially being ahead of the pack.  Then census + transfers opened up and it went to shit.  I think the census was saying (accurately or inaccurately) 62ishA/38H which is pretty bad but if ally are organized they can at least put up a fight and deal with it potentially.  After transfers they don't really have a chance anymore as they don't really have a presence outside Zhava + friends camping the way to DM.
---
Of course it's not completely accurate but it's the only resource we have.
---
This demon is probably the easiest to kill tbh, this strat cracks me up.
---
It's not. Last time I checked horde raids controlled most fp and rapes all of ss on a daily basis.
---
Not in classic
---
Tell them you reserve first orb and pass on all other orbs. You will still make out with 30g+ from doing that.
---
TSM Trade skill master - More in depth requires an acct
---
Auctioneer/Auctionator - Lighter more simplistic addon.
---
It was more of a suggestion. If you don’t want to have a life and admit to it, that’s fine by me. If you’re bored, go do something other than complain on Reddit. That’s all.
---
Best answer here. Guild is screwing its members by not recruiting those last few people. Pugs arent going to join as they like being handed free loot with no real commitment. The guild will never progress if a good portion of the loot isnt staying within the guild.
---
Is 300G a good price? Seems like it’s never going below 300...
---
Belonging to the enemy faction is not a justification for doing horrible things.
---
Yeah, the dude is right, 90 min clear is pretty good. Hell, I remember just telling people to ignore the loot on the boss and keep pulling trash and let the ML announce it saved us a whole hour...
---
It's taken some work to get to the point where were not consistently short. Were still missing a consistent resto druid of all things. Finally have 4 good rogues though, but our fury warriors aren't really putting out the numbers I hoped they would. I'm the Main Tank, and I threw on my dps gear and specced fury this week, just to see what I could do, and I beat every single one of our fury warriors. It was both demoralizing, because they should be doing better, and a bit of a morale boostz because I was parsing low to mid 90s in kinda crap gear.
---
Yep, for even levels. Though the difference between weapon skill and defense formula is different. 1 difference is worth 0.04% miss,parry, dodge and block. So, when you meet in tank you will see misses from time to time even with 5% hit.
---
But you'd require 325 weapon skill to only need 4% hit vs 300 defense targets.
---
Anything is possible of course, especially if you out gear them. But I’d say it’s a 8-2 matchup in favor of Warlock.....maybe 7-3 if the Druid initiates
---
Yea, arms is better for pvp, I just don’t want to switch specs every week. I’m not grinding r14 pr anything, just AV rep to exalted for items.
---
Right now there are people globaling 60s as naked shockies.
---
It's pretty obvious he plays horde on a 60/40 server.
---
If it helps him sleep better at night... Why not!
---
Daaaaaaaamn. That’s big.
---
There is a nice weapon in Uldaman. ZF too but hard to get - I would start going BRD asap for the endboss axe.
---
Arugal is horde dominated apparently but alliance is still usually locking down BRM and making DM impossible to get to without a few deaths
---
you could also not use exploits
---
Agreed, however, I do think that the people who quit should probably have somewhat thicker skin. That's not to say I don't understand their frustration, but more a comment on how this is only temporary and once bgs are released I think the problem will largely be fixed. So, a month of struggle and then relief. In the end it will be alright, it's not worth giving up all the work that they've done.
---
That was pretty long, but have you ever charged and gone flying up into the air super high to fall to your death ?
---
Pop it up for 90g - see what happens.
---
It just shortens the kill time which can make or break the fight on a PVP server, certainly did for me.
---
Same here been having a great time, and I hope it continues for you! I'm looking forward to BWL, where we get some more complex boss fights, and BGs.
---
it would probably be so damn cool to be a stealth class.. it would be like the zombie apocalypse
---
You may find something no one else has found yet if you explore well enough
---
Agreed.
---
If that didn't work, which it should, you can always open up a ticket and a GM will be able to assist you.
---
I don't know if this is entirely fair criticism considering the alliance probably just moved to a different PvP server.
---
Sweet! A retail player took the advice and went back to retail. Good job! This game isnt for you. And for anyone else considering going back to retail if you feel the need to complain about the way things are this game isnt for you. Go back to retail.
---
I believe the way this works is, assuming 2 players are both level 60: Weapon skill and defense are ignored, or normalized in pvp. You're kind of hard set/normalized to 300, so you have a static 5% miss  with 2h that you can gear for. If you dual wield and take on the 19% chance to miss instead, that's a lot more miss to gear for/towards, and +hit gear usually makes you very squishy. When dual wielding you only need 5% to land orange/active hits, but most of your damage is auto-attacks, and so not gearing for the +hit specifically is a big hit to dps and rage generation. I think this context is what leads to 2h being much better when factoring in swing timer and burst being important.
---
Raid-helper is honestly the best way to do signups, tenfold
---
Sulfras is not a PVE weapon anyway, it's a PVP item.
---
The guild is 100% being greedy if they choose to sell ingots rather than giving them to a guildie who participated in the kill which dropped the bindings.
---
Do you guys make guildies pay for BOEs too? Lava cores? Dark Iron?
---
Either funnel mats across neutral AH or wait for auto-completion.
---
Ok
---
Oh that is just gold! Well have to put some time into farming that for our tanks eventually. Not sure how many casters want that. Maybe warlocks? But thanks a ton! That's ZG, right?
---
I found it only needed on solenor.  Sure the others are demons, but this post is about minimal consumables.
---
I’m not too sure about the logistics but I imagine they get at least 3-4 kills off. They most likely do it on top of the graveyard for convenience. They have a brigade of players to protect the perimeter. GMs said they won’t do anything about it. China WoW is the fucking Wild West. I assume that the gold boys pay off people to get away with all their shit.
---
I never wanted them to add the vanilla Honor System at all because it was fucking terrible and the root cause of the problem.  It rewards this type of behavior, especially if there is no other way to pvp.  There was also absolutely no reason to not include BGs with the honor system.
---
Simply because you did not see this as possible doesn't mean no one did.
---
As a rogue I go into stealth just before I hit the ground and never have an issue
---
Makes you think, the Humans don’t really have a strong control over their territory? Outside the towns, it’s full of Murlocs, Bandits, Gnolls, Wild aggressive animals...etc. Like, I don’t think I’ve seen a farm that wasn’t run over by some problem lol.
---
The funny thing is, back in Alpha there was a lot of discussion about using DKs to help with the ganking issue. A lot of wow testers had played DAoC at that time and we knew ganking could make people's lives hell. Then before alpha ended they went 180 on DKs saying it would be too easy for low levels to grief high levels by wandering into combat with them. It was a very fast turnaround and people tried to talk them out of it. Looking back in hindsight, I think it's the first time I remember Blizzard pulling a "you think you want this, but you don't" move in regards to balance. Then just dropping the ball on it. There were a lot of ideas at the time but they kinda just said, eh, screw it.
---
You have to embed a code into the target frame option. You can search for the specific codes on google and how to do it.
---
Why do you think it is fair to say horde can never complain about alliance griefing?
---
I am just happy they brought the old whistle emote back.
---
OMG... That means I've played 3h/day average.
---
This is one of those things that sounds good on the surface, but nearly impossible to actually manage.  Blizzard has no idea what level 1 character a paying customer intends to play.  I'm pretty casual and I have level 1s across 8 different servers because I wasn't sure where I was going to land back in August.  
---
There's also a tipping point at that this particular server passed at some place and time that caused it to death spiral and other servers with similar faction imbalances haven't experienced so far.  The problem is it's only late in the game once player numbers have been truly establish that Blizzard could start saying "no, you can't roll horde here" but by then it's already too late.   
---
The biggest problem is the overall PvP server population Horde outnumbers Alliance so there's bound to be one or two servers with a ridiculous faction imbalance, this one just got the worst of it.
---
I just finished my 2nd level 60. Based on the original vanilla dynamics I rolled a feral druid tank as my first level 60, so I could fill a niche role and be a rarity for a raid group. My guild now has 5 feral tanks on the roster, and only 2 Hunters. As of yesterday my Hunter became my main raider, and in their first MC ended up 3/8 Giantstalker, with a T2 helm and the next leaf is mine as well.
---
I can't believe how the classic dynamics played out vs the original vanilla experience (which I was around for)... Druids and Warlocks all over the place where they were very rare 15 years ago. People min/maxxing all over the place and rolling around in blue items passing on tier gear because of the math involved for healing as an example. It's a different dynamic but it really comes with benefits too... people know how to play the game, and the higher the skill of your raid group the more success you can achieve with less time spent beating your head against a wall of content that's unkillable.
---
Overall I am really happy I picked a PvE server based on how World PvP and the gank squads have been on PvP servers. I am very happy with the state of the game and I'm really looking forward to new content to keep it fresh as the phases roll out. The AQ Gates is going to be amazing.
---
I wish all my friends who said they were going to play with me stuck around. Of everyone who was going to roll with me, only one of my friends stayed playing and raiding with me. Lots of people quit at 30 because of the grind, and lots of others hit 60 and disappeared because of the nuances of running to dungeons and other quality of life components that I personally like over retail, because it makes the game feel bigger and more dynamic.
---
Guy has Hand of Rag but no Molten Helm SMH
---
talking to an innkeeper and setting the inn as your home sohuld yield a new one. if it doesn't, check oyur inventory and bank. If you cannot find an HS then either, open a ticket.
---
Alliance don't have Shaman to give Sulfuras to. So it's just a meme legendary for them.
---
Oh come on now. You're implying now that every gank in the world is unacceptable? I understand there is a current problem with the game, but if you're gonna make a comment like that then you really should be on a pve server. The risk involved in questing and leveling IS fun for a lot of us. Yes it's frustrating at times, but that makes the game feel more intense for a lot of us. Getting killed occasionally while you're at 50% life out questing is the whole point of a pvp server. If you only want to pvp on your own terms play pve. PVP before phase 2 WAS fun. I got ganked at 50% health several times, sometimes I won though and that was AWESOME. That's the kinda shit we who enjoy wpvp live for. The problem is turning wpvp into an honor grind, that breaks it hard.
---
Really?  Even though Quel is a 52 dps one hander?  Not saying you are wrong at all,  i just find that surprising
---
Or just no Shaman in guild ;)
---
Easy rank 14 on flamelash for alliance. 200 IQ
---
Now this is Avengers level threat!
---
It completely removes the mechanic the demon has lol..  It's beyond cheese like you said in your original post but yeah for sure good for those who are struggling.  I'm horde on Heartseeker dodging mass alliance groups the normal way and was completely fine.
---
Let's be fair, lay on hand is a 1 hour/40 min cd
---
I will also put this on my dream list
---
It's a chat window.
---
So I went on the server. Saw a lvl 1 dwarf comparing gnomes to toiletbrushes and talking about the difference between diabetes 2 and rank 14 and a gnome doing a striptease for an orc hunter. 
---
God I never thought that dead server tourism would be a thing but ok.
---
There's no evidence to suggest 10k conc. caps, it looks more like 6k, but yes, that's still a lot more than vanilla. Still, it's not inherently a problem when that's 3k players on each side spread out across the world. It just requires more organisation than some people are bothering with. The funniest thing I've seen so far is that video of the guy trying to get into BRD and doing an absolutely horrible job of it on purpose to make things look worse than they really are. I've seen Alliance AND Horde on my server get fucked over and over again because they just rez individually and run 10 feet rather rather than all ressing in one spot and popping sappers or something similar. The game can be played better.
---
Anyway, people will forget how rough this part of Classic was in a few days when people are BG queueing all day.
---
I don't know anything about druids, but couldn't this be pretty decent for feral?
---
this is amazing
---
Agreed, theres only so much new content a really old game can provide. 
---
The best hope for this sub is to allow memes. Without them it'll only be complaining. Once the discovery phase is over with a game theres nothing to do but want things changed.
---
So there I was.... In the Silithus desert....
---
Warriors aren't even comparable. Any 2h dps warrior on horde gets fucked swapping to alliance.
---
That's legit, I started in 1.1 but my fondest memories are from 1.3.
---
Draw distance is the same as it was in vanilla. Stop crying.
---
QS+ Mira is slightly better, but I just propose you run it in the dps spreadsheet of the fight club.
---
Imagine being mad about a 60/40 server.
---
If he was the only one getting 15hk per week, wouldn't he get top bracket standing every week?
---
Wouldn’t it be really easy to get rank 14 now?
---
You get locked to a raid when you kill any boss, so unless you wipeed in luci and quit, you’re tied to a raid id now. If you enter MC you’ll go into the version of MC that you did earlier in the week. Any bosses you killed will still be dead.
---
I mean, if he’s reserving it and people still want to go - I don’t really see the issue here. 
---
Not like I’d want TF on an alt anyway, that fucker is expensive.
---
Retail IF is probably more poppin than this.
---
Sure you have, you Uber lvl 40 you! 😂😂😂
---
Literally the definition of a mass exodus lol
---
Thanks dog &lt;3
---
i’m missing something clearly.. you got 2 critz.. what’s the low chance referring to?
---
Isn't the whole point to incentivize faction transfers to balance pop? If you lose shit on the transfer who would want to?
---
Pertento is the best guild in classic Wow. Change my mind
---
WTS Molten Helm (on Zandalar Tribe Alliance) ;)
---
Crossrealm BGs existed in vanilla.
---
Realm population on PvP servers.
---
What about the people who actually do like Outland zones like HFP, Nagrand, Netherstorm etc? They just get screwed? Also how're you going to fit flying into the old world?
---
Yeah wow has the right kind of cartoony graphics, they never even struck me as cartoony! SWTOR on the other hand is a great example of ugly ass cartoony graphics
---
What is the "common" resource of level 60s camping Westfall though?  What is the self interest?  This is  killing the chickens before they hatch.
---
Best way to lvl is full fury using two hand weapon and respec to arms at 40, so u are on the right path. Don’t use cleave for lvling, hs uses less rage and deals more dmg, before 40 it’s rend, hs, overpower, auto, after 40 stop using rend, it’s just ms, auto, overpower. Yes u will fine with shield and mail at low lvl for tanking, all u need is armor. I have a lot of addons but nothing specifically for tanking, u don’t need any tanking specific addons.
---
&gt; Skullflame and flurry axe is what I'm saving for, but currently I'm 400 g short of a skullflame shield:)
---
Skullflame is really good for paladin and shaman tanks because the shield scales with spell damage :)
---
At first I thought "Well, better late than never."
---
20 seconds later I realized you're not riding a skeletal horse.
---
Your entire argument about how it “impacts you” revolves around the idea it is unfair someone puts more time into the game to farm better than you and that these same people somehow flood the market with golds and mat.  
---
Love the time tested “pay to win” argument.
---
Sucks to suck bro. I had high speed internet starting in '99. It wasn't much more expensive than the 2nd phone line we had for dial up. In 2004 4 of my friends and I all lived in a townhouse and paid for cable internet. It wasn't as fast as it is now, but it sure as fuck wasn't 56k. We weren't in a big city either, cable internet was pretty widely available in the early 00s. If you were over 18 and paying for your own shit it was easy to make that a priority.
---
On my server there's usually 10 on the ah going for 10-25g. Really low price for what it is
---
In my raid we have 5 tanks;
---
1 Main Tank
---
2 Primary Tanks
---
1 Feral Tank
---
1 off-Tank
---
Typically we use all 5 Tanks for the fights that need them, then off-Tank and Feral Tank change to DPS for fights we don't need them in. On Majordomo/Garr we use all 5, on Ragnaros we use 3, but even then you could do Ragnaros with 2 pretty comfortably.
---
This is just what works for us - but everyone's different :)
---
You're probably the problem
---
From u/Kalarrian on a similar question: 
---
When you kill a boss in a raid, you get an ID. Everybody else in the raid gets the same ID.
---
It costs 800g base.
---
Then 10% off for being Honored with Frostwolf, which you need to be anyway to buy it.
---
Then another 10% off for being rank 3 PvP, which you probably will be after farming AV for a few days.
---
For most people who buy it the price will be 640g
---
Can confirm the fact that horde has a lot of female characters running around now-a-days! Throws me off questing with someone and then realizing it’s a female undead lol
---
Well the term "mmo" has gotten so broad that games like Destiny and Wildlands/Breakpoint are called mmos, and seeing as how D4 has the same "random players appear in your game while out in the open world" system as something like Destiny I figured we were calling D4 an mmo as well, right?
---
Discord bot sign up. Works great imo.
---
Just wait til next week and things should improve a bit.
---
I'm on Thunderfury too! Just hit 51 so I now know the joy of being worth HP to 60s. Good luck out there friend.
---
5% hit so your specials (namely Pummel) don't miss.
---
Weapon skill is not useless, but not worth the itemization points (per point, it only gives 0.04% chance to hit/crit and reduced chance to be dodged/parried). Pretend it doesn't exist in PvP.
---
Think it's like the 4th one I've seen personally.
---
Spot on.
---
Best zone music in the game.
---
if they didn't add the honor system a ton of people wouldn't have played.  it's a flawed system, everyone knows that, but it is also pretty unique and the og achievement/title system
---
I knew this would be a problem, and I knew faction imbalance was a huge problem that no one else was paying attention to. the honor system was always going to be there, bg's are just a bandaid, faction imbalance will continue to kill servers - your "the honor system sucks" and "bg's with the honor system" solutions won't change that. gank squads will still be roaming between bg ques - which there will be because of faction imbalances. so we'll still be here arguing about solutions
---
I like the UD entrance too. It is also really nice if there is melee dps in the group, as someone usually wants the Mask of the Unforgiven, and you run right into him when you enter from UD, and groups doing live from main entrance usually skip that boss.
---
A boomkin with the Hand of Ragnerose is much like a mule with a spinning wheel. Darned if he knows how he got it, darned if he knows how to use it.
---
Even in the USA cable and dsl were fairly widely available unless you were in the deep country. I think lots of people just lived at home with their parents who didn't want to get it because they didn't care.
---
Just looked these up n thanks for the heads up! Already have lionheart helm, and these look like good thing to aim for next. Not sure if anyone has em yet but can get the mats ready at least.
---
The game doesn't give honor or rewards for killing lowbies.  Being level 60 and camping Westfall gives you nothing.
---
I have absolutely loved every minute of it, and it disheartens me to see others hurt by the faction imbalances. It took me 8 in-game day's to hit 60 as my Gnome Lock, 3 weeks IRL time. The biggest reason why I have so much fun with this game is the guild I play with. We've mostly all been raiding for the past 3 years on Elysium's Vanilla server, Warmane's TBC/Wrath Server's, and lastly the final (and last) version of Vanilla FeenixWoW. I have made so many great online friends during this time, heck even met a couple in person (4 live in my state!) Now we actively raid every week clearing both MC and Ony in less than 3 hours (including getting to BRM yikes...), and we're starting to actively pvp more in the world and can't wait to do AV/WSG together as a guild!
---
It has been a blast, on Whitemane it's 43A/57H based on IronForge.pro, so I feel relatively comfortable with the faction balance (the population is 8000, 5000-6000 is my ideal playerbase.)
---
Really, if it wasn't for my guild, this game would not be AS fun for me. Wherever they went in the private server scene I followed because it was always an adventure clearing content with. The inside jokes too, dear god!
---
TL;DR Find a guild/communtiy and actively be apart of it, this game is dreadful all by yourself (especially on a PvP server)
---
-Your friendly neighborhood Green Cookie dealer, SolarDeath the Gnome Warlock on Whitemane
---
True. Since this Boomkin is a night elf I bet you 1000g they do not have  shaman in the guild.
---
Yea TSM is WAY better IMO. It takes like 20 min  to setup and will change a good portion of the money making UI over to TSM. I love it. It allows you to see where all you money is, is going, and comes from. Simplifies crafting, I pump pots with cheap components all day.
---
This.  Don't buy the whole "durrr no pvp on pve server" crowd.  I've been pvping nonstop since the honor system launched, and I see a lot of familiar enemy faces around the world - we occasionally end up flagging and fighting it out whenever we come across each other.  It's also nice to see several couple level 26s running around unmolested in hillsbrad while all the 60s duke it out.  I'll actually be a bit sad for when BGs come out, but on the other hand I'm looking forward to some WSG after all these years.
---
The hardest thing for these 10 guildies + 20 pugs will be razor, and if they beat him you think they'll have enough cloaks for nef?
---
Agreed. I feel like horde have BRM on lock but alliance hold down EPL and strat
---
Kukukachoo - (H) Druid
---
So I guess classic wow wasn't for you. We all knew how phase 2 works. Some people still think this is some kind of bad design that needs to be changed immediately. Sorry go back to retail #nochange games not for you.
---
i'm a 37 dwarf priest that would like to be holy/disc for end game spec but am wondering if its worth rerolling as spriest when i hit 40. i had many many people recomend this saying its better for leveling and such but i'm wondering if its still a viable choice and be able to heal the dungeons too as i continue to level up...? thanks!
---
It's mostly Holy Shock and JoR, so you need to stack spellpower.
---
If you're holy spec and doing PvP right now, you'll have a hard time finding any plate with relevant stats (Lightforge and Lawbringer are both very poorly itemized). You could wear cloth, but uhm .... yeah that'd hurt.
---
Once BWL comes out, that changes. Judgement is a top-tier PvP armor set. Gives you pretty good healing stats, but rather than lots of +healing, it has lots of spellpower. And the 8-piece bonus boosts up judgements.
---
Vael is going to be deleted lol.
---
I know some guilds out there or PUGs might struggle with healing or dps but as far as my experience in my current guild where everyone is using consumables and we have every possible damage buff allowed and 20+ people are doing 400+ dps he's gonna die really quick.
---
Him being feral doesnt make it any better though
---
We almost have enough for a full party now lol
---
You really don't need to pop any consumables for the demons.  Solenor can be done with shadow protection buff from a priest + bandages.
---
Leveled a paladin to 60 on blaumeux with friends, notw im the only one playing. I went to Faerlina, got a 60 lock and joined one of the streamer guilds. Couldn't be happier. P2 has been a little rough since i hit 60 2 days before and im not very geared. I'm starting to get some items and turn the tide though, so its been fun.
---
Pretty sure there's almost always at least 5-10 people each on Alliance/Horde PvPing in Hillsbrad
---
Hah I remember that. If my memory serves me right you can see him in melee on your first Nef kill for the proc.
---
Though seeing Frosteyez getting putted all the way to Un'Goro during the Aq gate event is still the funniest thing I've seen.
---
The trail of the thunderfury like a shooting star.
---
It is if you already have aged core leather gloves, and use crit sharpening stones on your OH, but it’s so minimal I’d never take those over a rogue unless none of them needed it.
---
I mean TUF is in like 4 days. Could have waited for that :)
---
Dude you contradict yourself constantly.  Stop trolling.
---
Looks like an average episode of the Walking Dead.
---
Gnomes look amazing on tigers tho so its worth later. Also gnomes are the best race by far so
---
Pvp is still gonna be there with bgs. Alliance are unable to play on a ton of servers, so people are just quitting. I’m not blaming you specifically, but no one HAS to contribute. But it’s not your fault it’s blizzards for allowing this. Faction based population caps would have solved this.
---
First, I am also deep prot and do the same thing.  Second, how do you have 52 skill points :P
---
There is water you can get while making money instead of spending it... Run Strat UD a bunch and get the water from the crates. It's only 2.9k mana but it's free and plentiful in strat UD. I got tired of buying mage water everytime i logged on, so now I just keep stocked up on this. I still keep a stack of Argent dawn mana biscuits if quicker regen is needed.
---
AHAHAHAAHHHA pls tell me you are not making this shit up AHAHAH
---
What is % hit chance difference between 308 and 310 weapon skill? I play rogue and don't know what's better 3/3 evis or 2/2 combat mastery (20/31 or 19/32)
---
Objection!
---
&gt; because they're used to fighting solo against 3+ horde opponents?
---
The shock of a 1v1 makes either side confused.
---
If either side was from a server that overpops the other, they'll scream and shout "WHERES MY BACKUP!?"
---
...And vice versa if they were the underdog "There's gotta be thirty more behind that bush, I know it's impossible.. but, why bother?" and both will just stand there. Turning the BG into a socialground
---
 I honestly don't care what server I'm playing on. As long as I'm playing with my buddies. But those buddies have their own buddies. If there were an easy smooth way to just transfer my entire friend/guild network to where it needs for the health of the game, I'd do it. RL friends and I have discussed how we'd prefer to play on the minority faction. But we've invested too much in to our current mains.
---
I think most people who had a problem with men playing female characters have grown over it. And back in vanilla I remember there were a few.
---
Man I hope they make a pvp video.
---
It's has to have an Omen of Clarity into max rank Moonfire ofc :)
---
It's more like,
---
If you do it and there's no written rule for it and no proof that it's against the rules, then it's fine until it's known that Blizz isn't okay with it. Once that information is out there, at least if you get a warning for it, you shouldn't do it again. That's how I'd deal with it.
---
Technically yes, but talent tree is still absolutely broken. Most of the talents require you to get CRIT to gain anything from them, and why would you want to get hit with a critical attack in a raid as a tank?
---
Yeah, we have a rogue that’s there a lot too. He was #1 for alliance week 1 and probably week 2. I believe he’s still #1, but a bunch of others have keyed in on this and are there as well.
---
Tuesday head pop pre-raid Herod

---
The real question is what does it matter? You going to reroll right now to avoid possible queues? Just play and enjoy the game without constantly looking into the future of it and worrying.
---
I honestly believe thats what sapped a lot of enjoyment out of the game for me was stuff being instantly cleared, farmed, and people only focusing on what was coming months from now or in this case a week 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
yup, the arcane mage spec is the talk of the town on the off-meta discord, would suggest talking with those [guys](https://discord.gg/3JXSamG) about it.
---
Imagine going on a small break and coming back and seeing nobody in IF, having no knowledge of what recently happened. PepeHands
---
It's almost like WoW isn't Counterstrike...
---
And why didn't anyone announce this in the old fb group? Happy to see you guys around here. Auri, from Dragonfang. Kealo is here with me.
---
Damn, Just got my leaf and I’ve been most worried about this demon due to PvP. I think I just found the solution, thank you!
---
Ppl really salty over this damn, so hilarious to Read 😂 Thanks
---
Open up your options, go to unitframes - target. You then press "custom text" and create a new custom text, name it whatever you want.
---
Then copy paste this into the text box in the bottom right

Because it was just an approximation of my build, but it ended up being wrong. My real build is (14/5/32). Apologies for the confusion :P
---
I mean they only had two choices right? Where else would they go. You can’t expect them to stay there.
---
The funny thing is that they dont let the horde switch servers too haha.
---
They later added a time limit to WSG (and a resource counter to AV) to prevent stalled, kill-camping games...
---
I agree with you.
---
Reminder: it’s “week of December 10”, it may not be out until a few days later.
---
It wasn’t garbage when it came out. But it sure does look like one now.
---
~3,700 was the number floating around for Ragnaros from the beta. Sunder + FF removes over 3,000 of that armor. Meaning Badge of the Swarmguard only gives about half of its max potential benefit.
---
Add Annihilator or any other armor debuffs and it gets even worse.
---
Yes throw away your full bis char to spend another month leveling and struggling to find dungeon groups because blizzard wont make faction based queues.
---
I think the massive damage increase will make Razor easy.   For nef, I think I remember people without cloaks used to be able to hide behind the throne and avoid the shadow flame or whatever it was called.
---
Yup. Flag and PvP up to Sergeant / Senior Sergeant in a couple of weeks because of all the action in Hillsbrad.
---
Unflag - go farm, play instances without a hassle, raid on time and clear 10/10 1/1 in a single night, go back to PvP when I want.
---
PvE server is the best decision I ever made. Glad I didn't listen to all my friends (who've long quit even before phase 2) and did my own thing.
---
I'm personally fond of having them on Alt+1, 2 and 3.I have my abilities boung to 1-6, shift+1-6, ctrl+1-4, and then stances on alt. Makes it fast to hit, say alt+3, shift+4 for hamstring or something like that. Experiment with different binds and find something that works for you, that's what I did :)
---
Is this another one of those Alliance servers getting in line for better and efficient honor farm? :)
---
*I never camped any FP's*
---
-undead priest, currently camping FP's abusing MC
---
No difference to lvl 49 tho cause every 60 does it.
---
I made fun of WoW for how shitty and cartoony the graphic looked when my brothers said they wanted to play it in 2004 while I was still stuck in D2. Then I played it and loved the game. Yeah still cartoony but gameplay was great. I don't see how Swtor had cartoony graphics either. I only played that at launch for about 1.5 years. Have they gone down hill?
---
Not even close, 2h fury on horde is slightly below dual wield on single target but pulls significantly ahead on cleave fights, which make up like 80% of the content in MC
---
Works better on a meleekin than a Feral.
---
&gt; Melee Boomkin.......anyone ?
---
Are you referring to dps or tank? A boomking raid tank is very much a thing. Sadly, a melee Boomkin's dps starts to fall off around Phase2.
---
Flamelash horde is shambles. Really this is legitimately hilarious but this is the last time blizzard opens transfers for both factions.
---
what the hell man
---
They are killing those Defias scums.
---
Which means that it is technically true. Sitting does not activate these abilities, but theres a lot more going on here than just sitting. You're tricking the game into thinking your standing while also getting the auto crit from sitting, because when the server batches it says "hes standing".
---
You legally changed it once which means you can do it again. Now where’s that can do attitude?
---
Of course. But premades set the meta and the “proper” way of playing, which never includes prot warriors.
---
Even boomkin is better in battlegrounds because they can root, dispel, and scout. 
---
My point is that no matter if its randoms, some guildies, or premades, youre gonna be deadweight in WSG as prot. Put on a 2 hander to fool people if you wont respec
---
Wait, do you unironically think that most Classic players are active in this sub? Out of my guild of about 150 individual players there are about 5 who frequent this sub. And these people aren't casuals. We have two or sometimes three raid groups that have been clearing since week two. Former private server players don't give a fuck about this sub anymore.
---
Gear and spells? I thought I recalled some spell rank upgrades dropping in AQ as well. That's not fun.
---
what do you mean #YOU people
---
I felt the same way.  Cata completely ruined WoW for me.  Loving Classic.
---
Missing several squares for WSG terrain-jumping screenshots
---
This is exactly how it was back in 2005. There are just more people and more information available so you are exposed to it more now.
---
Dec 10th there will be no more world pvp gank squads preventing casuals from questing.
---
It's something like 137 people have to get above 15hks
---
Was thinking the same thing
---
Look at the amount of PVE servers compared to PVP.
---
~~rapes~~
---
\*destroys, ftfy.
---
Am I the only one who thinks Horde should have to stay on that dead server?
---
They did it to themselves, now Blizzard allows them to go ruin another server.
---
Good place might be in dungeons with PUGs, people you meld well with, ask them if their guild is recruiting.  That is tougher when guilds move past pre-BIS grinding, though, they're fairly unlikely to dungeon pug a lot.  You're more likely to get a raid spot when a younger guild building their team that way, but that might be a good way to help guide a guild in the right direction by getting in as a class officer given your experience. 
---
Regular in game chat, sometimes guild will advertise in LFG.  Things to think about are aligning with raid times that work for you, being ok with how they do loot (+/- to difference sytems). 
---
Attitude/maturity might be a bit of a crapshoot and might take some trial and error.  When guilds are typically fairly large so you're unlikely to like everyone, but certainly there will be a majority culture type of thing with each guild.  Finding a the right culture is definitely a big part of how much you'll enjoy the guild.  I'm on my thi
---
Hand of Rag and raiding as enhance. I have peaked :)
---
Some say it. Some mean it, some don't. Some think they mean it but would never roll Horde without the overpowered racials.
---
We've already had 2 eyes drop!  We haven't seen a BRE or SR yet, but we have two eyes.
---
Still messes with those addons.  The more pages the longer everything takes to load / scan
---
So what?
---
The proc and dps value are wasted. It's a vanity weapon that has nice base stats.
---
I was once levelling my mining in Hinterlands when a horde player come next to me. We both sized each other up for a few seconds...then proceeded to take turns to mining the nodes. It was a beautiful moment, a romantic story that shall forever live with me.
---
Rapes like the filthy dogs they are.
---
This isnt no changes, no changes would have also meant  back in the day realm sizes.
---
These super realms are a change, and the change is exactly the reason were in this shit.
---
Restorstive potion can, if you popped one in advance. He obviously didn't, unfortunately.
---
If completely min maxing dual wield but pop a shield on every 6 seconds to hit shield slam then flip your offhand back on.  Not sure if there is a macro to do it.
---
Are you looking for your own WoW romance? If so you might be a *Creep*
---
&gt; I don’t think it’s that surprising.
---
Ehm, that's exactly what the Surprised Pikachu meme is about. Something which should be absolutely obvious but still happens.
---
For Gondor!
---
Other than the +12 strength there is nothing this hammer gives you... Such a shame :-(
---
You're basically a floating helmet with a sword. It looks ridiculous.
---
can macros check your rage before switching stances to cast an attack ?
---
Unless you already transferred, the free transfer period ended yesterday. Anyone following the Alliance to Earthshaker will now have to level to 60 and gear up all over again.
---
Panzer-kin has made its way into Vanilla!
---
The guild i joined in TBC downed 4h in vanilla with 5 tanks. 8 probably won't be required this go around.
---
So Feral tank here, What advantages does a shaman tank to a raid?
---
A feral brings a crit buff to a melee or tank group and my dps is WAY better than another prot warrior when not tanking and Druid tanks are optimal on some fights  to the massive health pool and armor (a lot of non theory crafters font realize this). The additional innervate and battle Rez are never really complained about either ^.^ So I’m wondering does shammy brings anything to the table like this?
---
Why did anyone choose to stay?  Why, what is the point?
---
On the flipside ... elemental shaman are absolute burst dmg beasts.
---
Depends if they are using the classic AV thats running on retail right now then its gona favor horde ALOT
---
* In your experience, less women talk in voice chat or tell you their gender than in retail or Vanilla.
---
There. I fixed it for you.
---
You think the classic subreddit is bad? Check out the general classic bnet fourms, makes reddit look good.
---
Besides all these useful tips you should get +wep skill if not orc or human, so that you dont have glancing blows
---
So I've recently leveled engineering and got all the trinkets, on top of my regular trinkets. 
---
What addons do you folks use to easily swap between trinkets?
---
I use F1, F2, and F3
---
Its not an issue, as there is a lot of people still lvling, some have rerolled, some are alting and some just joined classic late.
---
Yeah, wait 5 phases to save yourself 800 gold.
---
Someone can’t take a joke lmao holy fuck Jesus Christ this community is so fucking aids
---
Thing is he would've got there quicker IF he did get the 60% UD mount
---
I would say that a Prot Warrior with a 2H is dead weight compared to one guarding a base or running a flag.
---
He's not in serious premades. He won't have a dedicated Druid with full consumables with him at all times. Being able to run flags yourself (and running them better than all but 2 classes) is useful and it adds value.
---
No, macros cannot check your rage.
---
Warlocks are far and away the best 1v1 class in the game.
---
Warlocks get improved shadow bolt and ruin talents, both count on crit procs.
---
Those artwork/posters or whatever they are called, are amazing👍🏼😉
---
maybe they have a timetraveling draenei stuck in the past isolated from his people, just silently waiting for the dark portal to open to reunite with his family
---
Ask yourself, was the faction balance a big problem in phase 1? I didn’t see 1% of the complaints that I see now about wpvp. 
---
It’s the honor system that’s the problem. 
---
On retail, you can go to stormwind or orgrimmar and change your phase to PvP or pve. 
---
Horde dominate the PvP phase. 
---
Blizzard looked to balance it, so they gave alliance players a quest to go out and kill 25 horde for a shiny piece of gear.

Alliance had raids camping flight paths, took over the horde city killing everyone in sight, camped corpses. Once people got their 25 kills, they were replaced by another player looking for their 25. The game was unplayable in warmode as horde, despite horde having more players and despite having more capped characters. 
---
Incentives are the problem.
---
I specifically said 5 mans. Also i only switch to shield if im taking a lot of dmg.
---
Also if you have no idea what you talking about in general it seems
---
Personally I'd implement a faction queue so you can't get online without similar numbers online for the other faction. It would be shite for the dominant faction but should keep one side from being rolled.
---
We've had one goretusk pie, yes. But what about second goretusk pie?
---
I have a macro for each stance the equips the correct weapons. Scroll up, down, and shift+scroll down. I always use scroll wheel for stance changes on Druid so it just followed suit.
---
If you're able to, using something like TeamViewer lets you remotely control your desktop, meaning you can enter queue/log in as you're on your way home. This does require you to have your desktop on while you're away. I know multiple people that have used TeamViewer for this and apparently it works great.
---
Exactly means without discrepancy, you then went on to highlight a discrepancy.
---
I can confirm Hand of Justice exists. I got it on my first Angerforge kill. 
---
I’m sorry....
---
Oh shit, I just moved onto earth fury last night! First thing that happened to me was a raid of 60 alliance came and ganked me in stv. I was running past the arena after chest dropped and they spotted me along the road on their way out.
---
I'm in same boat, my only irl friend who plays got 60 ages ago and is already decked out in epics. Its nice getting a boost every so often though! Hopefully I'm aiming to hit 60 before New years.
---
Have you ever inspected someone in this game?
---
As shitty as this time is, and I'm Alliance being camped 10v1, it is less shitty than making changes to the game. It's easy to blame the #nochange anytime something is bad; it's even cowardly. 
---
Yes the game is not perfect, but shielding it from ease of life changes is what allowed Classic to be good.
---
Plot twist he is actually a famous writer of horror and needs to be evil ingame to write his best evil characters
---
A premade would never do that, except on a day before the reset if they're honor capped I guess.
---
Whos gonna use deathbringer if that drops lol, rogue cant use axe and it’s too slow for tanking....
---
Means I missed it. I played yesterday but didn't know it was an option:(
---
Hand of Rag is not good enogh to justify its costs. Most ppl will dodge it. Thats how it end up on meme spec players
---
Check out some of madseason's videos on youtube. He has a bunch of different lore videos.
---
Is there any resources for paladin gear anywhere?
---
Druids have [Taladril's guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#) and rogues have the [panther website](https://shadowpanther.net), but I cannot find anything for paladins.
---
Particularly I am trying to gear a holy paladin with a shield. I did some googling and the icyveins and wowhead guides pop up both of which give me an incomplete scope of what I am looking for. Any suggestions where I should be looking to make my own decisions and not someone decide for me?
---
Thank you, this community is awesome :)
---
Yeah his response saying it was cartoony was pretty confusing I thought the game looked fantastic. I mean zoom in on the characters in modern wow. I personally think they destroyed the graphics of the game. They are more goofy than ever.
---
I would argue that the macro system being wildly different, allowing you to do some things you couldn't do in vanilla and even more importantly preventing you from doing other things that you COULD do in vanilla is an equally huge change.   The population cap being 2-3x what it was in vanilla is an equally huge change.
---
Was that a joke?
---
Strat and Scholo have amazing xp/hour.  But they are 59+ dungeons.  I hit 60 in a Scholo run.
---
It’s more of a why do you give a fuck kind of thing. Also I can almost grantee you’re a creep.
---
There is no +hit gear at that level. You'll get high crit no matter what, especially when 15 agi on weap/gloves are a thing. No decent rogue would risk a kick/gouge miss for some crit.
---
Yeah turns out announcing to the world how you all transferred away while transfers are still open wasn't the best plan.
---
Same on herod. I don't bother with pots or food buffs in the open world. If I'm in a 50+ zone, I know I'm eventually gonna get wrecked by an ally pvp group rolling through
---
Horde with multiple accounts will just funnel mats through the neutral AH to finish AQ.
---
Okay I see did you set a level 60 requirement then? Geez horde must have tons of alts. I guess we do have a crazy huge banking guild/conglomerate
---
Yes I am and the issue did start after I installed it. I will have to check when I get home.
---
If you get excited about stomping a cockroach, thats kinda weird man.
---
BGs are cross realm and out in a few days though
---
&gt;roll on dead server
---
...
---
&gt;complain its dead
---
woah
---
Guess what huntard, i don't PvE. 
---
So ya, you are still an idiot who doesn't get the fucking point.
---
Clarification: one advantage classic will have over BFA is that I will be able to create / find premade BG groups. 
---
In retail the folk only make premade PvP groups for competitive arenas
---
If by ridiculous you mean hilariously awesome, I agree.
---
Go play overwatch if you want to listen to a female talk lol. I think that's all that plays now a days.
---
This totally went past me. Didn't know it was an option. I miss the time where I didn't have a full time job. Wish they did these warnings ingame
---
On EU zandalar tribe is the biggest RP server as RPPVP but RP is non-existent. dont know about Hydraxian (pure RP)
---
Likely not even true, but no way to verify.
---
Oh, they will.
---
and I said that they will play "properly" 95% of the time, but when you get into a premade gravyard camping group, you wil remember it.
---
The raid armor sets.
---
on mobile but I think a macro like this will work
---
#showtooltip Heroic Strike
---
/startattack 
---
/cast Heroic strike
---
/stopcasting 
---
making one for cleave is useful too if primary/secondary target dies you can cancel
---
Wow really brings out the best in humanity lmao.
---
K for the second time I never implied that he is in serious premades.
---
You said you would prefer a prot warrior with FAPs to a druid, and thats wrong in so many ways, so I wanted to address that.
---
You were also implying that there is some benefit to flag carrying as prot that you dont get as arms, which is also wrong. 5/5 toughness isn’t moving the needle.
---
If you only run dungeons then might as well stick to holy/disc. If you plan to quest then shadow is highly preferable, though it's probably better to wait until 45 so you get wand spec and higher rank of mind flay.
---
I'm not saying they're being jerks just by ganking people. That is what it is. Right now there aren't many other options. I'm referring more to their overall behavior, particularly in chat. It just doesn't seem like a community I would have any interest in.
---
More will leave if wpvp keeps getting worse. It's what me and many others enjoy the most and will only get better when bgs are out because gank squads will fade unless they do what you said since it's faster than 40 minute ques.
---
Wholesome content.
---
Eventually, yes.  Blizzard hasn't really been transparent about it.
---
10/10 times someone starts talking about “where are all the girls at” and have been looking for them in a game, they are a creeper.
---
I rip aggro on our tanks during execute phase as well.  You save your Recklessness and Deathwish for about 35% and then go from 10th to 1 in DPS.      
---
Lionheart Helm/Ony Neck/Viskag/Onslaught/Flameguard/WoS bracers..the rest is prebis.
---
I've heard Mirage Raceway, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
I'm wondering the same thing for my horse characters.
---
Well that's not a ranking premade then, just some fools messing around.
---
For PvP'ing on a PvP server apparently.
---
”F”
---
My bad, I checked again and the site I was referencing wasn't ironforge.pro but another one that someone used to point out that server X was dying. I didn't notice that the site in the discussion changed.
---
Sorry for this mate but this is wrong on so many levels. Closed it after the first 30 seconds. You literally can't make a mage video where your fights are 1v1 considering that your opponents are literally " lvl 1 critters" where you 2 shot them, that's just not fun and there's no challenge whatsoever 
---
Good luck on the next one and keep this in mind when making it.
---
*Child sees nothing wrong with childish behavior*
---
Yelling isn't against the rules.  Using faction translators is.  If you yell and it's incomprehensible for the other faction, no one cares.  It's when you do the 'o k b o o m e r' messages that you cross the line.
---
9% means that your specials won't miss anymore. Going beyond that means that fewer of your white attacks will miss. Swapping out hit for crit would result in an increase in DPS. If you're curious, the hit cap for white damage is 28%.
---
Shhh don’t let them find us
---
You should raid in a pug anyway. I have seen Earthshaker drop a lot from early bosses. That stun proc + mace spec is stupid fun in pvp. I ran a dungeon with it as mace spec, and I'd whirlwind and just stun the entire pack of mobs constantly.
---
For druid shifting, which I guess is similar enough, I use an extra mouse button. Click for bear, Shift+click for cat, Alt+click for travel, Cntrl+click to go back to elf. Something like that might work well.
---
Yeah, its not the efficient way to rank up. But again, people are camping honorless flightpath targets and people who are even releasing at the spirit healer.
---
So I don't think anyone would be surprised to see it happen.
---
This here is the epitome of a leet wow classic pvper who enjoys getting assfucked by 40 man raids and call it pvp. Please elaborate in what shape and form is that pvp?
---
A lot of Alliance have been quite excited for AV and have been talking about it since Classic release, talking about how they'll be queueing in guild premades, etc. I have not heard one person even mention WSG's existence, so unless the sky is falling, I wouldn't expect many to head into WSG unless they have no other choice and are trying to grind out R13-14.
---
It’s like fucking lost on the crowd these days. From behind which bush did all these minmax try hards come from?
---
Ah but #NoChanges.
---
Dead servers and faceroll Raids.
---
Boomkin piece of shit
---
You didn't get those both on your first kill? JK, but yes ive personally seen both drop
---
30 FR from the weapon slot.. I'd let him tank my raid.
---
People that release at graveyard still give honor though.
---
Only female tauren. Male and female characters have the same hitbox for every other race.
---
Can anyone tell me if recklessness doubles the threat gained from abilities that don't do damage such as sunder armor?
---
On private servers every single game people were doing the jump, premade or not. Expect it to be the same here after new players learn it.
---

---
No it was vanilla. Our Horde side never got the full resources.
---
What would you do if a new raid was released in classic? Wait around for others to kill it and create video tutorials for you?
---
C  F R and I use a mouse with 12 buttons on the side it's great to never have to move your hands
---
And earth shock too plz
---
I think it's so freaking cringey to use the word "female". Makes me think you're a neckbeard
---
1 is battle, 2 is defensive, 3 is berserker
---
It doesn't. And as long as people keep falling for this there's no end in sight.
---
Implying that death ball grind honour by killing other death balls and not by ganking regular players going about their business.
---
I was able to 2 man farm both these items with a healer 2 weeks ago. 35 consecutive runs for HOJ and 15 consecutive runs for SGC
---
Can confirm Savage Gladiator Chain does drop. Just took me 736 arena clears...
---
There's a guild on my server called &lt;Girls Only&gt;.  I always wonder if it's actually girls only, or just a silly guild name.  Its a decently sized guild, I see their members daily throughout azeroth.
---
If you killed a boss, you are locked to that same instance of MC until next Tuesday when the server resets.
---
Yeah he dies like 5-10 seconds before rag dies Everytime lol. Taunt swapping during execute seems to help though.
---
Was just curious because all the rogue guides set you up for like 15%. I assumed that must have been the way to go, but nothing is clarified.
---
That's fair, I take the hit on my molten helmet and toss on my Mask of the Unforgiven for the fight though too. Might just be and extra few percent threat over a long period of time puts me over the edge.
---
Alliance thinking rping all around IF will save them. Nerds
---
Sounds about right lol
---
We mostly distribute loot via rolls right now using a loot priority list, i.e. only x and y classes should roll on Z.
---
Because we're probably gonna be running that shit for months to come and so we're bound to get whatever we want from MC in due time.
---
Welcome to /r/classicwow. 90% of the people on here don't know what they're talking about. A good example is how half of this thread thinks AV is about farming honor and not rep.
---
Lots of priests switch to shadow at 40 for the form! It’s what I’m doing on mine right now actually
---
Are battlegroups confirmed?
---
Durid is 4 fren!
---
So you do nothing but PvP in quest rewards? 
---
Damn no wonder your'e so mad. You must get one shot a lot.
---
I'm pretty confident in my abilities on my Druid. If I don't want to pop a FAP in a game, but I see a Warrior using them, I'm going to let him carry it. He clearly wants it more than me.
---
I am not implying anything about Prot vs. Arms. I'm simply answering the question that was asked.
---
My most fun has been waking up at like 6 am before work and playing for an hour when populations are way down.  I go to Azshara (a relatively dead zone) and hunt horde while picking herbs / farming felcloth.  This morning I went 23-1 in WPvP and had a few 2v1s.  This time of day is so great for a few reasons.  Felwood satyrs and essence of water is nice too but again i don't strictly farm i do 60% pvp, 40% farming 
---
\- Scarce population, but competition for certain spots still higih enough where theres usually horde there.
---
\- Few people online, so you cant just /1 and ask for help.  If i kill someone during primetime they'll just get help and overpower me.
---
\- great time for a solo player (i'm hunter, so I can be sneaky with track humanoids during this time and almost always have the advantage).
---
It's kind of a bummer because when I log on during primetime my desire to wpvp is very low.  Huge groups, zergs, etc.  I've honestly just started going to sleep earlier so I can wake up earlier for a better experience.  During prime time, I level low alts in non pvp zones lol.  Hopefully bg's bring this spread out wpvp back during other hours
---
Looking back they were pretty awesome. They let me do basically everything except I wasn’t allowed to come to aq40 for progression nights. They were able to eventually get everything on farm except cthun so that’s the only boss I didn’t see there. And they never did beat him. They also let me do the spider wing and rasuvious in naxx but they didn’t get too much further than that. And then BC came and I was able to become a more core part of the raid team for that expac.
---
thx a million mate! 
---
Just hit me up whenever you have time!
---
You can definitely build a system for it, each player has a dictionary with player:kill# stored for 24 hours, but it's another realtime system to build.
---
Morgraine pretty much dodged all the drama. Strong alliance core and overall great community. This server is pretty much as good as it will get.
---
It's just going to get worse with battlegrounds. Alliance will queue less and less after being rolled by horde premades. Especially when they realize WSG isn't timed, it can last for a long time after Horde caps the flag twice and just graveyard farms for the next hour or so.
---
It is really impossible to say and that's half the fun of a living, breathing commodity market. Pretty dependent on a lot of intangible/unknowable factors. 
---
On my server (high active population), for instance, Greater Eternals have been on a steady upward trend for a while as more and more people hit 60 and start obtaining raid gear worth enchanting. I predict that they will continue going up for a while yet because there is still a lot of gear people need, but eventually there will be a tipping point where a high percentage of people who are going to get geared are already geared and there will be a period of somewhat lessening demand until BWL releases. But who the fuck am I? I could be totally wrong. 
---
The one thing you can know is that they will continue to hold some value for quite a long time as there will always be some quantity of people who need enchants.
---
droprate is very low, wowhead is not accurate as those mobs will often not drop anything and those times are not counted in the total drop rate (as if those kills never happend)
---
Shout out to all the shit posts from people who can tell the future, and read minds....  You are the problem!!
---
The discord bot is extremely easy to set up and use. I use it for my guild. It takes about a minute to setup a new event.
---
If anyone is lurking and considering a reroll, Windseeker is pretty great. Mostly adults, relaxed crowd, at least Horde side. If you reroll, send me a PM here or in-game mail to Armet, and I will send you a couple bags to get started. All I ask is that you pay it forward when you can, let's spread kindness.
---
It's not about can't, it's about cost and priority.  All software is about cost and priority.  It could be, due to legacy software written 15 years ago, it could be a huge PITA.  It's really impossible for us to say even if fundamentally the problem is not super complex to just store a dictionary of player name and # of kills for each player, and do a lookup on every kill to increment the counter.  Even someone who PVPs a lot is only going to have maybe several hundred player names to track, which is fairly trivial with modern software and could either be cached or just high latency.
---
Cap is 6k on servers.
---
And Private server had up to 3x the concurrent cap of retail, and still worked fine.
---
I like how he says 'safe' instead of 'save'. It's like he did it on purpose.
---
An orc with edgemaster’s? /vomit
---
Dagger skill is free man, just use a mugger’s belt if ya don’t have ACLG.
---
Doesn't change the fact that the world is packed tighter with players than it should and has been designed for. They're not spread across both continents, both factions are spread out in relevant zones for their levels, most of them being level 60. People use mostly the content that's optimal, they minmax, and as such people are concetrated in specific parts of the zones or taking the same paths to instances etc. This magnifies the already high population cap.
---
Of course both sides get fucked. But the minority faction gets suffocatingly so. I can tell you first hand I did arena runs for a week as p2 launched, and I died on average 7-8 times, 13-14 times on the worst ones and 5 times on the best. Even if it was botched in some ways, it was an accurate representation of what I've gone through personally, and it sure sounds like you've had it easier eh? Oh and everyone popping sappers, 'just' grouping together, you have to remember those who go to BRM do so to get geared to then start to farm gold for luxuries like professions (especially such as engi) or getting their 100% mounts.
---
The only people who will forget are the pvp maniacs who have their gear, their mounts, their supplies sorted before p2 hit and enjoyed the phase for it was the only relevant content to farm. Most of my guild has resorted to raidlog, LFG channel is 1/10th of its activity than it has been before, and frankly I don't think it'll ever go back to the joyful buzz we had before p2.
---
&gt;their biggest downfall is running out of mana in the longer fights
---
There is also a less obvious hurdle for Ele shamans. Almost everything has a decent amount of Nature Resistance and there aren't very good options for combating it. Funnily enough, the answers to this issue are all item based, kind of bolstering your argument. I think a great many things can be fixed via itemization, but actual changes to classes would be my preferred fix. That way, class viability is less restricted to obtaining certain gear.
---
Genius.
---
Bandages are a consumable.
---
Yeah SWTOR had issues, but graphics wasn't one of them.
---
DM: East. We clear pretty much the whole instance as Disc/Frostmage.
---
Take a look Blizzard. This is just the first of many. Still happy with your free transfers for everyone? What an absolutely horrible, pointless decision. You fucked up the re-launch of a 14 year old game. Fucking clowns, could've been great!
---
I have a nice beach to sell you in Eastern Plaguelands.  Don't mind the name, it's just a local joke.
---
Ah gotcha. So I’ll just wait till 60 to make the switch. 
---
So for raids then, going deep resto isn’t the most effective spec to be as a shaman? Would it be more beneficial to be elemental?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/user/Rextroy3](https://www.youtube.com/user/Rextroy3)   
---
Keep an eye on that guy's channel, he posts some fun stuff.  
---
Shockadin, like the other meme specs, is garbo without engineering, but you can pull off some fun combos with it :p
---
It's ironic that you say other people have missed the point of the game when you seem to be the one in that situation.
---
WoW is a world with many different kinds of players, from the most hardcore no-lifer to the casual fishing main. We can't all bend over for just your own special needs.
---
PVE HAPPENS IN PVP SERVER
---
Layering was the worst mistake they made.
---
Letting people lvl up all the way through STV without engaging in PvP, that was a disgrace.
---
death is an option so you always pack more than you need
---
gfpp for trash geddon and rag.
---
every mp a healer doenst need to spend is less downtime.
---
fucking mongo
---
I envy you.
---
60/40? Fuck off dude
---
Female gnome it is.
---
It absolutely got this way between Honor Patch and BG Patch.
---
Well rockbiter is better dps for PvE since windfury typically just overkills targets when it procs.  Windfury for PvP 100%
---
Horde when the ally they transferred along with just outright quit.
---
They specifically said that they're not doing it in classic though.
---
That's a bingo !
---
You wanted the company that thought layering and megaservers were good ideas to make further changes. At some level you must understand why people were hoping they could convince Blizzard not to make any changes. Look what Classic has become with the one major change they made.
---
Flurry is great, applies chance on hit to mh so a good mh will become better. Axe of deep woods, iceblade hacker, and especially the ever eluding death bringer
---
you're weirdly sensitive
---
OP says he is level 40...
---
Showing when energy gain is going to tick next.
---
Meanwhile in Black Desert Online...
---
But private servers did change the game, they just did it an excellent way and all of their changes was justified. Such as starting 1.7 itemization to compensate for the 1.12.1 class talents.
---
Nameplete overlap?  Whats that??
---
I dont see what that has to do with target highlight on a mob..
---
I hadn’t played retail in over 10 years.  Yes I went back.  And despite your comment it is fun and guess what so was classic.  I can enjoy both.  
---
That’s right!  I enjoyed both!
---
What? The opposite is true. In this case, the alliance would have a more inflated economy than the horde. Even without the -15% cut from the goblin AH, you will be selling goods at a loss.
---
The better play would be to sell goods to other alliance players at a profit and let them eat the costs of selling to horde.
---
Anything in particular you skip, or any special strategies?
---
Have you seen the new WC3 models? I think a WoW 2 in that style would work really well.
---
The irony of suggesting someone go to retail in this post.
---
Netherwind is balanced
---
You do realize edgemasters has value beyond just daggers, right? 
---
You also completely ignored the fact I also said “or if you already have the necessary hit.”
---
You legitimately continue to sound like you just have no idea what you are talking about.
---
it's funny because even if you only put 3 dots on him he was dead
---
Personally loving it. Basically missed WoW back in the day because I was die-hard into EVE, but so glad I can experience the game mostly the way it was back then.
---
mass exodus can mean rerolling or just straight up quitting too.
---
I would pretty confidently say no
---
They drop, you just need to get lucky!
---
Find a caster who needs the arena belt and bribe a healer with the trash drops.
---
What? He needs a good weapon to melee after getting oom.
---
Have a naga
---
I dont think so, I play horde on Morgraine and the Alliance here has a thick skin and a solid core. I would be surprised if they transfer off. Also no drama and greate community overall. Morgraine is a rather stable server
---
what do you base that statement on?
---
DR is not hard to do at least, and should provide a good estimate from my understanding of how things actually work.  A document store could do this efficiently, or as suggested below the client could keep track of DR locally for an estimate.
---
lol yep.  DayZ is great.  So far the best game to date with hardcore is Diablo2.  Nothing has it with the type of progression WoW has though which would make death that much more painful.  Imagine a guild taking their first shot at Rag with perma death.  They all got there without dying once..  that would be intense.
---
For me, it was TBC that ruined WoW. I loved Arenas and some of the best zones, quests and instances came with TBC. But the shared faction capital mixed with flying combined to make a much less enjoyable experience than vanilla.  
---
THANK GOD for classic, and may the portal never open again!
---
You could try turning down some of the graphic settings allowing the ground to be clearer.
---
For druids which have been my main since the start of WoW, I like to use my mouse wheel. mouse wheel scroll-up is cat form, mouse wheel scroll-down is bear form, mouse wheel SHIFT + scroll-up is Travel Form and mouse wheel SHIFT + scroll-down is my Aquatic Form. In TBC+ I added CLICKING the mouse scroll button for Flight Form.
---
Benediction is the opposite. I can't even quest right now due to alliance gank squads...
---
People are clowning you for being a creep but I think you make a valid observation. Its not creepy to wonder why this game seems 100% male dominated. Pretty illustrative of the community that the first thing everyone thinks when you mention this is that you are trying to be a creep! I think its valid question and the reason people don't want to engage is because the answer is that people who play wow are generally speaking sweaty neck bearded nerds that scared away everyone who can't tolerate their bullshit... myself included.
---
Blizz isn't going to add new features to classic. Get over it.
---
The shadow lies upon his tomb, in iron forge, not kazad dum. But still the sunken stars appear, in dark and wind less dun Morogh. 
---
There lies the crown in water deep. Until the alliance wake again from sleep.
---
Transferred my characters yesterday, the tedium of 60s camping the boats and flight points got too annoying. I’m not even level 50 yet so not even worth honour. Utterly stupid player base on that server.
---
guildbank is atm saving up for BWL and AQ.
---
currently we have about 300-400 of each flask in raw mats as far as i know.
---
goal is to have 600 by bwl
---
What change was made on 22-Oct ? Just linking the aggro tables ?
---
That is some absolute trash luck
---
I tried to level in searing gorge because I'm a dumb noob and I think that zone is awful for anyone who's not level 60. I couldn't stay for more than an hour before I abandoned all my quests lol.
---
Merging will never happen because they cant do anything with the duplicate names.
---
Axe of the deep woods and Flurry axe are BiS for orcs
---
I fucking love you Neuro
---
Definitely my bad luck then. Being a tank warrior also results in anyone with half an HP bar chasing me down.
---
Doesn't the ironforge site only count people from their raid logs? 
---
Which means that it just counts how many active raiders there are on any server, and not the entire population.
---
The actual information would be that you shifted the discussion from talking about why a Warrior would make a Heartseeker because they can't get dungeon weapons into one where you're using Distracting Dagger as an offhand and I don't understand how weapon skill works. My offhand right now is literally Distracting Dagger. Why can't I buy Edgemaster's (which also increases Axe Skill) if I'm a Warrior (who is also not a Human or an Orc, which would be required for this premise to work)? That also increases Axe and isn't BiS for dagger rogues for the entirety of Classic.
---
I'm trying to be courteous here, but this just doesn't make any sense.
---
...an addon does it, dude.  It wouldn't be that complicated to build the same thing into the game.  Jesus Christ you people are something else.
---
Since I’m guessing some of us me included are total noobs can you please either not use abbreviations or tell us what they are?
---
That or faction specific queues while offering free transfers to the overpopulated faction are Blizzard's only real option at this point. Both options will probably piss off a lot of the player base so they probably just won't do anything to address faction imbalance. Paid transfers will just make the unbalanced servers worse IMO.
---
My guild uses /roll with the rule you can only win 2 items a raid night (MC/ONY).
---
They keep a spreadsheet of who’s gotten what - myself has gotten the most caster gear. When I win I’m asked to pass to the next highest roller which everyone does. 
---
I like the system it keeps it fair imo - we’ve had no issues at all.
---
if the other faction is basically 0 I doubt blizz would disable free migration from that server
---
I am so glad your not in my raid, it's insanely hard to craft because it's meant to be built by a guild not a single player. 
---
We've had two drop for our guild and the first person was given all the ingots they needed and the second person will be given as they drop etc. but they were both expected to farm the remaining materials themselves.
---
If they're good they are. I've seen a lot of HPals that are just ok at best and I think it's because a lot aren't fully committed to being a healer. Many are some sort of dual spec and enjoy also either tanking or dpsing, and have specced for such in the past. The amount of people who actually want to be a healing Pally and are fully committed to doing so is shockinging low.
---
Well, they can do something about it but it'll just upset people who don't get to keep their name.
---
most locks aren't conflag specced
---
The trees roaming through the "forest". Otherwise, we clear pretty much all if it. Including trash.
---
1. all lasher packs
---
2. all imp packs
---
3. hydro + lethendris (we split, I do hydro, he does lethendris)
---
4. zevrim
---
5. all satyr packs (one pull)
---
6. trash before endboss
---
7. endboss
---
8. rinse. Repeat.
---
*dwarf
---
It's literally not worthwhile to try against premades though, makes it a 12 min loss w/o any honor rather than 8min loss w/o any honor.
---
I have an alt on a rp-pvp server, Deviate Delight. I kind of wish I'd started there because yes the community is way better.
---
Lol, thank you very much for the support! :3
---
I just pray that they never do that. Let this be a lesson to those who camped FP, Cities and made the game unplayable. In my eyes this is perfect karma. Unfortunately not everyone seems to have learned since we are starting to see a bit more of camping FP in our new server.
---
I want this to be box art for a 486-era Sid Meiers farm building/resource management game
---
How do you run MC with that many teams without being raid locked?
---
No but crits add more threat so its good for spamming hs rage dump on ony.
---
Layering and mega servers are not the cause of this.  Also, people have shown REPEATEDLY they want to be on megaservers.  Blame blizzard for dumbshit they actually do instead of trying to blame them for player actions.
---
The ring came off my pudding can!
---
Get told for weeks that what you´re doing will drive people away, keep doing it and wonder why they´re gone.
---
Vast majority of these ganking wankers will not reach rank 13-14 and all this was for fucking nothing.
---
Congrats on destroying a server because your brain doesnt work.
---
Thank you Blizz for letting the pu$$* run away in fear :(
---
I mean yeah. This is exactly how it was back then. WPVP is trash 99,99% of the time.
---
This is what I have seen on Arcanite Reaper. They couldn't handle being in what the alliance deal with.
---
honestly return to karazhan imo is blizz's best dungeon ever made (explicitly referring to dungeon, because for raids ive got a heavy lean towards naxx for best raid)
---
Try RP-PvE Alliance. I absolutely guarantee you'll find a lot more there.
---
xD
---
All you would have to do is transfer? Like all the alliance who quit? Yeah imagine lmao
---
I've been saying in this in every related thread, read my lips, the vanilla honor system will encourage widespread malfeasance the likes of which was not known in the past. People will either play unhealthy amounts, cheat or acct share, all of which, mind you, Blizzard supposedly doesn't support on paper. What was a faulted system in the past will turn into a disaster today.
---
How can I find out the faction ratio on my server? (Rattlegore)
---
Imagine PvP happening on a PvP server.
---
Sounds like you had a great time, man. Cherish the memories :-).
---
you have a 120-160 people in the guild and run 3-4 separate raids
---
I auto get the eye of sulfus when killing rag my heart rate doesn't go up as much as black lotus spawn being up running to if and failing twice in a row...
---
Depends on your guild's attitude, and your resources. Flasks cost about 100g, while food and small elixirs go for 5-15g per stack. 
---
Bring at least 6 greater fire protection potions if your guild plans to do rag. 
---
Bring and equip fire res gear for the packs before/after geddon, might save your life.
---
Lastly, be honest to your guild and let them know if you are not familiar with certain parts. People will love to answer questions twice over wiping once
---
I’ll humor you.  Let break this down.  
---
“Not true”
---
My statement was true. 
---
“T2 gear isn’t always better than PVP gear. “
---
False. T2 gear is always better.  Why? Because when classic was released T2 was super rare.  Clearing raids was challenging.  Believe it or not it was almost impossible to find information on raids. 
---
The premise of both your statements.  T2 isn’t always better.  Depending on class.  
---
Ok what class is better without T2 gear than PvP gear?  How about instead of just throwing insults around you back up what your saying with either in game knowledge and statements.  Try that it might help you out.
---
I know this is just a shitpost.. but setting up, through a realm discord or something, a 60 in gold shire to be a “raid boss” for 40 level 1 chars sounds kinda cool..
---
A bunch of horde players have been complaining about not being to farm or do anything on their new home in Arcanite reaper after transferring. Their punishment is the realisation they aren't as good as they thought and only dominated due to numbers.
---
My RP server has alot of females. We have a guild called chicks in chainmail too. Guess it's only warriors and paladins.
---
It's a game and it makes people feel happy.
---
Yes, in retail it is a max 15 minute game.  Some games end with no body getting a cap.
---
Sunken Temple is also a good option.
---
Find out bracket sizes, people on discord should know.
---
Or use one of the census websites.
---
The gatekeeping is a bit silly. I played a pvp server when I started in BC, while I enjoy the memories of avoiding ??s, ghost running with my brother, and the occasional rush from getting pay back; I'm perfectly content on my pve server this go around. I'm not 16 anymore with more time than sense. I want to log on, do my runs or farm. The only time I slightly miss a pvp server is when someone doesn't respect the inter-factional code of mining: if your fight a mob on a node, it's your node. I have had nodes stolen by my own faction so a pvp server wouldn't help that anyhow and it's few and far between to really matter. Made a nice mining dwarf buddy the other day, when one of us gets a good amount of  crystals we lay off for the other get some.
---
Yea thats why I said getting a solid PvP group. I know exactly what to expect.
---
Yeah there's a really big difference between a Holy Paladin and a *Good* Holy Paladin. Like night and day.
---
Holy Paladins aren't OP, *Good* Holy Paladins are OP
---
Rockbiter is better on a slow two-hander while leveling. WF can be comparable, but it more inconsistent and you tend to overkill more often.
---
You dont
---
Screw you fatty!
---
there are still some Defias to kill :P
---
Stops when you leave combat I think. So if you’re stuck in combat the “DPS” will be wrong for the fight, and of course the time until combat drops will also lower your DPS slightly.
---
Deep resto is definitely the best raiding spec, 0/5/46 to be exact.
---
An elemental build, 30/0/21 is a very strong dps in dungeons and pvp and it is a capable healer in dungeons and raids.  It's mediocre dps in raids and not as good of a healer as the deep resto build but it's still viable to heal with.
---
“Signed up for my first MC ever. It’s a pug”
---
Should read before commenting, chief. It’s not a guild run.
---
ah i see.  
---
But i disagree with that.
---
Except that it has happened a lot throughout WoW's history.  You can see it in retail when you have to message someone's server name also.
---
Tanking SM?. Currently, LVL 33 and specced into the arms tree. Is it possible to tank graveyard and library? 
---
 Also what should be the main focus for armor as I level? +Strength? +stamina?
---
Recettear is a game about running an item shop, but it has some mechanics that make it feel a bit less NPC-ish. It's quite fun
---
I'm all fucking for that. It's become obvious that it's going to be very hard for the casual/solo players to coexist with the hardcore/pre-made players and enjoy themselves, and this time around the disparity between the two is probably going to be more significant than in the original game. If nothing changes, I won't be surprised if I end up just giving up on BGs unless I find a pre-made.
---
Yeah you're probably right to be honest
---
I was standing on the Stalagg IF bridge yesterday. To my left, there was a horde raid by the Inn and in the tunnel. To my right there was a separate horde raid in the house and in the other tunnel. Behind me, there were horde in the auction house spawn-aoe’ing, and in front of me there were horde spawn-sappering.
---
Zandalar Tribe Goldshire Inn is Empty all the Time... i know it from... sources
---
well im sure your ability's never miss at 3% your white hits maybe. but at 3% you wont miss a backstab / sinister strike or any other ability.
---
Of course it will, it lasted longer on private severs! 
---
Think guys like you should go play retail where new expansions come out every 18mths or so, and leave classic to those wanting to play only classic.
---
makes it a 12 min loss w/o any honor
---
1. I'm pretty sure kills give Honor in WSG
---
2. You're going to wish that WSG was only 12 mins
---
Yeah, but now there's less horde to compete with to get High Warlord.
---
Yeah it seems like weapon skill and hit is very important and comes before crit for raiding. 310 swords reduces glancing blows a lot and thats a huge amount of dps.
---
Oh I thought you meant that person specifically was running 3-4 raids per week.
---
I can just imagine running around Ironforge with like 30 stacks of this buff and one shotting everything.
---
Outfuckingskilled
---
Yeah pretty much right on the money there, bud.
---
I did 3 demons in 2 days. Took me a week to kill Solenor. Not because he is difficult. On my server, it was constantly contested. Alliance kept attacking him and despawned him.
---
Same on Gehennas
---
I love watch Kief murder alliance. He's a good rogue. :)
---
&gt; In pugs you will probably stop being accepted around the 30s or so. If you run with friends or guides you can easily tank end game dungeons, just don't except a raid spot.
---
You can more than shaman tank in level 60 dungeons. Recently, my guild had a shaman who tanked a few bosses in MC, it was nearly indiscernible from a warrior tank. I can link you an interesting article if you want to know about shaman tanks
---
It's visceral because it's in a picture but the much sadder thing are the tens of thousands of people whose excitement soured over the course of a week or two and simply stopped playing. There were many adventures and friendships ahead of them if Blizzard had bothered to do things correctly but, instead, most of them are gone forever.
---
It's the best weapon in game for a lot of classes. And is extremely rare a hunter having it is a monumental waste as it isn't even good for a melee hunter
---
 Badlands
---
It was a beautiful time that improved all specs and classes while keeping the integrity and uniqueness
---
Take food buffs at least, maybe a few mana pots if you are a healer. But should t need anything else for MC.
---
It would have been a shitshow for a week or two before leveling out as private servers proved.  Layering ensured the shitshow will continue for months.
---
Go with woman.  Teenagers like being respected as adults, anyway.
---
(Although that last line makes think I'm getting whooshed here)
---
aqual quintessence is always nice
---
and no, you don't need to watch the videos. Just don't be a pleb who runs in front of the tank and accidentally pull mobs.
---
Also wait a few seconds (or until they told to) start dpsing, otherwise you might also wipe the raid.
---
Consumables are also not necessary for MC, unless you are planning on speedrunning it.
---
Dust wallow marsh, cave just nw of ony entrance.
---
You don't need anything minus some fire protection pots for rag.
---
What class are you? If you're a class with a decurse or dispel then read up on the things you need to decurse or dispel. For consumes I wouldn't waste expensive ones on a pug unless you know it'll be pretty smooth. Bandages and some sort of pot that restores your resource.
---
If anything, Alliance would be the faction where all the super-hardcore PvPers congregate.
---
- The only imbalanced BG is AV, which is basically a free win for alliance
---
- Paladins are *the* best PvP healer by a mile and blow shamans out of the water in utility, CC, survivability, and healing output.
---
- Fear Ward, Desperate Prayer, Stoneform, and Escape Artist are excellent, reliable alliance-specific abilities.
---
In comparison, Horde have... Hardiness, WotF, and War Stomp. Nice abilities, but nothing compared to everything alliance has going for em.
---
Further, as so many idiots love to parrot "Everyone knew that PvP servers would be 60% horde because WotF and Hardiness!" 
---
Well, if that *is* something that "everyone" knew, super-hardcore PvPers are also part of "everyone" and knew it too, so it stands to reason that they would be further incentivized to choose alliance as the population difference means that:
---
- They have less competition for R14
---
- More HKs per hour with fewer of them being repeat kills that're affected by DR
---
- Their BG queue will pop faster after their premade stomps a full group of randoms (and thus more total honor per hour)
---
- Their opponents are more likely to be less skilled (since bad players will buy into the hype over WotF/Hardiness and will disregard or undervalue all of Alliance's unique strengths because "OMG HARDINESS/WOTF SO OP!")
---
I stopped playing just before P2 but was on Flamelash and this makes me sad. I just chose a realm at random when name reservations went up. I never ganked any alliance, even after being camped when leveling. More often than not the two sides seemed to be relatively civil though. I guess honor changes things.
---
Greater fire resist pots. Buff pots for your class. Mana regen water. Goodluck!
---
My only issue with TBC is I didn’t like Outland as much as Azeroth and flying mounts cheapen the gameplay. Everything else was amazing
---
Contrary to what everyone says I don't think Blizzard has bad intentions with Classic. Fans outside and within Blizzard were pushing for this for a long time, and someone (Omar Gonzalez) finally got the OK to spend a few weeks on it. When it turned out to be possible to run vanilla on the modern engine, they put more resources on the project. It's an experiment which has been, by nearly any measure, a great success. Clearly they're not sure where to go with it, since they have mentioned possibilities of Classic TBC and Classic+.
---
Blizzard themselves have mentioned [citation needed] that they hammer down on private servers not because they care so much, but because they have to  protect their Copyright. If they do not prevent others from running servers, they're effectively forfeiting their ownership.
---
As for the future, I'm sure there are people pushing for retail and for classic. It's a big company. Given the number of subscribers that Classic has yielded, I'm positive that investors won't outright dismiss the idea of classic development. The main question is how will they proceed after Naxx, after TBC? At some point Classic content runs out and they have to take it somewhere. 
---
What I want to happen: Classic+ with TBC alterations that keep the vanilla design philosophy.
---
What I think will happen: an expansion with a compromise between retail and classic is released. People from both games are funneled into one until the classic servers are empty.
---
Starwars galaxies basically.
---
Thank you dancing wookie.
---
Sources
---
Yeah, that's my server too. Sorry bud. We're not all bad. I've basically abstained from wPvP since P2 started. I still don't haven't gotten enough HKs to get Scout lol. Couldn't bring myself to do that to people.
---
Minecraft or GTAV RP servers.
---
ZF as a duo should make a lot of gold, like 50g an hour maybe more!
---
You’re pretty simple minded aren’t you
---
I would love to make a Booty bay art!! it will come, it will come...
---
Can you guys transfer off Stalag?
---
Perhaps the premade who have accepted that they will never be bracket 1 will farm graveyards, but it’s much worse honor than rapid wins, so the best premade(s) will not be doing this.
---
Yes sir! &lt;3
---
I ignored your hit comment because it’s irrelevant.
---
Edgies on orc is just bad. Swords are for rogues on horde, and dagger skill is free.
---
Is your guild handing Band to you, or will you roll off  vs other classes?
---
Isn't that server already unbalanced?
---
They should join the minority faction on  servers which are salvageable, not fuck up bad servers even more.
---
possibly sixtyupgrades.com
---
instant shadow bolt (Nightfall proc)
---
Doesn’t seem like anyone is crying about this except you
---
That isn't merging, it's the cross realm shit they did instead of merging.  While you may want to argue the that it is a semantic difference, there are significant differences.
---
Greater fire pot is good for Rag, food buffs are always good. Beyond that some elixirs are cheap but it’s up to you. Most pugs don’t use consumes because risk of death is higher than in a coordinated guild group.
---
&gt; Yeah.... no.
---
&gt; No real Taunt
---
&gt; No AOE Taunt.
---
&gt; No defensive cooldowns
---
None of these are required to tank though.
---
&gt;No they didn't, they migrated with the alliance and left everyone else in a dead server. All the horde pvp guilds left.
---
Thats honestly fucking hilarious
---
Probably. 
---
Still dedication though.
---
I've been kind of wanting a twink this time around, thinking I might go with a druid because a 39 druid seems like it'd be fun/borderline broken to play in WSG.
---
AQ40 is the first raid where raid gear is an absolute requirement.
---
Afaik the transfer is only available to Horde.
---
Except he will also get the BG queues as an additional downside compared to the allies that are outnumbered who at least get to have instant queues.
---
This is the new short-lived meta. Everything will go back to people complaining how unbalanced are servers in just a few days.
---
Is this a pvp server? I’m tempted
---
Prolly right but of all bosses i feel he’ll be the ine that slows ppl a smidge
---
Cool story, didn't ask for a response
---
I downvoted your comment for the amout of stupidity in it.
---
Making boats and flight paths unusable isnt just playing the game.
---
YOU! What, do you own the world?
---
Perhaps. But it is hilarious, and takes Hunter Loot! to an entirely new level. I'd be 100% okay with it, and I don't play hunters.
---
well i mean, technically the Rag hammer has the dps/dmg of an AQ40 lvl 2hander, its just a shame its a HAMMER, making it only viable at all for Human Retripalas in PVE, and if youre only using it for PVP you might aswell use BRE in most cases anyway.
---
share me guestions pls
---
Hence why you do it preemptively. You should be fine by the time you get to the road. Resto pots last for 30 seconds. If you're burning through your mana so fast, that's a problem with overspamming serpent sting or not downranking arcane shot.
---
If you like Shamans so much give druids a shot.
---
Stun is king in PVP. Mace &gt; Swords &gt; Axes. Swords have a 5% chance to double-swing, which means 200% damage with a chance for them to crit, which is better than Axes.
---
It upset me the mage casted slowfall and didn't die. I would of panic died for sure.
---
&gt;...suddenly the Horde has 100 more people. The bigger the server population the worse small % imbalances are.
---
But it's still the same relative advantage because the Alliance population grew at the same rate as Horde in your example. As the numbers get larger, the population imbalance would matter less because you're introducing infinitely more possibilities as to what could happen in an engagement. In the 100 player example, things will play out the same way more often than they would in a 10,000 player scenario.
---
Untenable queue times just means they'll stay out in the world ganking until they eventually quit. And by the time they quit, so will a lot of Alliance. 
---
Classic is reeling.
---
Yup. The game's content been already cleared 15 years ago. At this point, one of the many reason to play wow is to try out new things. I cringe when I see people say "hardcore" and they're playing a warrior...
---
You're part of the problem
---
Dude the GM has full logs of everything that happens. They don't hand out bans based off of one person's reports unless they go through the logs and see a reason for it. Post the emails like everyone else has said, or yeah you're full of shit.
---
How do you see when they are queuing?
---
The same would happen on Fairbanks i bet. Horde camping IF basically 24/7. I know if they opened up xfers our entire guild would up and leave. We have plans to do so once they open up paid xfers.
---
Which ones are you having trouble with? I can help you out!
---
That sounds fantastic. I would unironically love getting mauled by a grey trash mob in wow... of course, once my seething rage had passed and it was made clear to me that it was a player and not just awful game design.
---
You deserved it. You’re a mage. Said a warrior.
---
Fury/Prot: 
---
Mousewheel up - macro to conditionally change between Def Stance and Serker Stance (I rarely swap to Battle Stance in this spec, since I am not spec'd into the Arms tree, and lose 100% of my rage when swapping stances). 
---
Mousewheel down - macro to swap between dw and sword+shield
---
Fury:
---
Mousewheel up - macro for conditionally changing between Serker Stance and Battle Stance. 
---
Mousewheel down - macro for Def Stance &amp; equip sword + shield, for those oh shit moments.
---
Why would it be a joke? All pve servers have way less raiders according to ironforge.pro.
---
Idk if you know this but Alterac Valley exalted is a much easier rep grind and rewards a very cheap epic wolf that imo looks much cooler than the orgrimmar wolves. Taking the undead 60% until AV next week and grinding out exalted for the cooler wolf might've been the better plan. Unless you don't like the way the av mount looks which is obviously subjective
---
It was pretty similar from tbc to work too, since it was only ~70ilvls between SWP and Naxx10 gear (maybe less?) alot of us ended up doing raids in our t6+ gear. In some cases stuff as some items low as T4 was better for stuff like hit rating/set bonuses etc.
---
Hi, /u/petitehippietits

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e70r8f/whats_the_most_competitive_pve_server_on_eu_right/). 
---
I can't really disagree with what you're saying, I just think unless you've literally never played WoW before in your life, you had no excuse. The system people are complaining about was in place in 2004-6, we knew it was coming back again, and we knew it was going to happen before BGs launched. We knew all of this before the *game* even launched. If you wanted to ignore all that and go in blind without do any preparation, that's fine, but doing so and then complaining about how rough it is makes it hard to care about what people are saying. My guild isn't some super-elite-knowledgeable-hardcore-pro-team and yet we still managed to figure out what we needed to have done by what time in order to not completely fucked when P2 rolled around. That meant prioritizing dungeon gear over literally everything else, because we knew it was going to be hell on earth.
---
Whatever, our conversation isn't really solving anything. At the end of the day I think the situation is terrible on some servers, but people crying on 60/40 servers need to man up.
---
You should try playing the fucking game.
---
Thank you for pointing it out, i just updated the Stockade one! 
---
The older ones were designed without the "novel cover version" in mind, but i'll edit them to have that version as well. :D
---
Where is the novel cover version?
---
This post was meant to be just a little "haha" take on the PvP whining, but I do appreciate all the recommendations coming in.
---
It’s allowed but blizzard won’t intervene if you get scammed

Spy doesn't interact with render distance at all
---
1200 depend on server economy , in the server where i play ,  if you buy all the materials in AH and pay the craft we are on 1000g ..but arcanite bars can only rise from now on .
---
I mean you just seem to have a really poor understanding of human behavior
---
There’s more than just reddit for posts.. there’s discord servers and other forums people frequent. This stuff also travels fairly quickly by word of mouth.. would you say your guild of 150 individual players have no idea that camping FPs non stop and having Zerg groups killing everyone including low levels is having an adverse effect on alliance populations? 
---
Horde have been seeing a massive drop off in alliance player base over the past couple weeks and anyone with any semblance of a brain would be able to understand why...
---
Kromcrush is majority horde unless we just recently got an influx of alliance from the free server transfers
---
Ive tied em to macros with other abilities, makes it way easier imo. For example, battle stance is tied to overpower:
---
/cast battle stance
---
/cast overpower
---
So if I need to swap stances I press it once, if I need to swap and use overpower I spam it. Have zerker stance tied to a WW macro and a pummel, def stance tied to taunt and an equip shield + 1h + shield block (my oh shit button).
---
What unitframes are you using?
---
As a creator you want to believe everything you make is better than the last. Also you want to believe you can do better than predecessors from 15 years ago that weren't strictly professional game designers. That's why the current guys didi want it, people not wanting your game but some old relic that you hear about all the time that's better. But I'm guessing there was a push to just what the numbers would be as the private servers weren't massive
---
No problem.  Forgot to mention, you'd want to have a swing timer addon if you don't already, so you can see when you should be using it
---
Thousands of gold for an extra 30 FR, that's going the extra mile!
---
100% this!
---
Only needed mana pot for Klinfran and Solenor, no pots on Artorius or Simone.
---
 No, I do that enough in real life.
---
Good luck my friend! If you see a dwarf priest named Cróssblesser be sure to wave.

I'd let him raid my tank.

Sexually.

Whenever I pop all my cooldowns in execute range I pull aggro and die. Should I be spreading them out throughout the fight?

Everyone knows youporn today
---
Horde has BRD on lockdown however.
---
This isn't the #nochanges crowd's fault. This is 100% blizzards fault. 100% blizzard fault starting with the decisions they made on name day. 
---
We had \~140,000 people subscribed to this subreddit on name day.  If you split that evenly, which you shouldn't but just for theory purposes we will. 70,000 people EU and 70,000 people US. With old server realm caps at \~5,000 people we should have had a very minimum of 14 servers based on the subreddit population alone. We got 6, or 8? I cant remember anymore.

The problem with this was that everyone had guilds formed up in discords and friends and they all picked their server. They instantly became attached to their server and it made it more difficult to talk people into creating their character on a different realm and making sure all their friends came to. In classic with raids being 40 people, after you make a decision with your guild, your guild starts telling their friends who also choose to roll on that server and if leadership in the guild says "just kidding we're going to Arcanite Reaper" you'll just lose people. In reality this isn't a huge deal, but some guild leadership says, "Meh, its fine. We'll stay here". Nobody ends up re-establishing on a new server.
---
"we can't create 14 servers based on those numbers. WHAT IF PEOPLE QUIT LEAVING DEAD SERVERS!?" Fucking merge them. Combining 3 dead servers later on is better than what we have now and I don't know why people don't understand that. 
---
"It ruins immersion" for what? Random raiding guilds are popping up out of nowhere? Okay how does that effect you at all? "The economy is now fucked", maybe for a few days... It will stabilize and there will be a new economy. If you look at every server the economy varies. You don't know every players name because you didnt level up with them? Okay its only been 3 months of launch. Youll learn peoples name's and what kind of person they are over time. It would have been completely fine. Literally the dumbest Q\_Q i've seen on this sub reddit. 
---
You know what would have been better? If they opened up these realms and then LOCKED the servers after a certain population was met. Maybe like 10000 characters being made for each faction? This would have FORCED guilds to look at other new servers in the beginning. However they just opened up migrations and offered no incentives other than "lower queues" for people that moved. 
---
In the end blizzard made shitty decisions involving server management and now we all get to suffer.
---
Yeah prio crit the most then go for ap
---
I can almost guarantee you're a shitty person for being a dick to a random person just over an observation.  
---
OP didn't say anything shitty or creepy, but you just had to be a dick.
---

---
What are some good grinding spots for a lvl 40 warrior? Shimmering flats basilisks are a bit too low now, rock elementals at kargath are pretty full leading to low exp/hr
---
I just don't agree in this specific case. He could leave the server with everyone else and have a healthy competition to get honor. I still think it's lame as fuck. Nice, easy wins for him picking on the few remaining players, non of which are probably high level players.
---
I don't mind getting griefed in PVP in most cases. It's part of the game and on a healthy server it's up to you to find a way to fight back. In this instance, I think it's fucking lame. :)
---
I know we disagree, but I hope you have an awesome day. Happy hunting out there! My character is a 60 priest on rattlegore named Kabob. Come by and say hello sometime! :) Cheers mate.

You're not supposed to have multiple of the same square.
---
Its fine.
---
Yeah i agree. But i also strictly play only horde ever since vanilla and private servers so i really have 0 idea about ally. Plus i play only on pvp servers so its only ever dwarf priest. I also forgot about escape artist considering only really good pvpers use it most bad players forget about it.
---
Hopefully this is the last stand of these update posts.
---
If he advertises the raid properly I would imagine he wouldn't get sign ups (at least not melee). If he implies the TF is ressed for the tank or some such then takes it himself he might get sign ups but when people realize it was ressed to a hunter they will be pissed.
---
Fool of a Took!
---
The randos who dont pvp, reducing those servers to ash.
---
Were about to see one of the modern game designs greatest fuck ups from Blizzard with 0 actions done about this.
---
Roll does suck but DKP sucks too. It forces a lot of items to go unwanted and everyone just saves up for the best items and there's a lot of times you know if something drops you won't get it. 
---
Look I am on the losing end of /roll and it does suck. But I never really liked DKP either. It has it's own problems. 
---
Idk what the best system is. If you lucky /roll is pretty great. But DKP is probably the safer overall bet especially for classes with lots of players like rogue/mages/etc.
---
We have multiple females as part of our raid team... maybe you just had a small sample size?
---
You can find it at my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/imadreamwalker), there is a free version as well :3
---
Hard to say if it's worth it. Whisper the people who are already crafting it and find out how much they are asking as a crafting fee. On my server there are still only 3 people who craft it and they have all decided on a 250g crafting fee. If you do something similar you could recoup the cost pretty easily over time.
---
When I played back in the day, I used ZXC for Battle, Defensive, and Berserker, respectively. Pretty easy to drop down to with ring, middle, and index fingers without looking, and no shift+ or ctrl+ button combos.
---
How?  Do you need to ask somebody in a city to enchant for you and give them the mats?
---
They´re going to sheep them or mc and wait for the debuff to end for the kill.
---
Its like flight master camping, just a different location.
---
Probably not anymore. The fee used to be 200g on Herod alliance. Now one of the crafters is paying people 5g to let him craft their helmets out of spite over the previous monopoly on the helm crafts. Probably not the same on your server but I imagine that the crafting fee has gone down significantly as more people have gotten the pattern.
---
That may depend on how many premades are rolling around.  If 4 out of every 5 games ends up being against a premade that rolls you over in 5 minutes and farms you for honor for another 5, you're probably going to stop queuing pretty quickly.
---
6 greater fire? What.
---
If your guild is still pugging I guess a roll system is the only fair way to go right now. Once you start raiding as a pure guild a different loot system should be put into place using DKP or something like that.
---
righto
---
Unless you're playing against the most pathetic excuse of a premade to ever walk the soil of Azeroth, you're not gonna get kills vs them as a random group in a BG.
---

If they all transfer you might not be ally dominated anymore
---
Keyrings when tho??? &gt;_&lt;
---
I appreciate all of you guys commenting and giving me some insight. Sadly character transfers ended and we didn't know they were ending so soon so we will have to wait for the next round. Until then, Bigglesworth is our home.
---
&gt; it seems like if some of you meet IRL, you'd stab each other to death
---
(x) doubt. The internet gives timid people the buffer to act like they bought a pair of big boy britches. Yes, I realize the irony of my saying this, like this, on the internet lol.
---
Damn that's crazy that's like Rogues in my raids. All our tanks have Wraith helms, all our priests have helms, hunters, etc. But we have yet to see a T2 rogue helm and there's 7 of us. Even were doing split Onys for awhile but have stopped recently and  gone back to doing it as a group. 
---
But we have had T2 rogue pants drop twice now I believe and I won them Wednesday I am so fucking happy!. I was the least geared Rogue of our entire group since we do /roll and I suck ass at rolling. But I finally got an item I have always wanted and super happy about it. Now I just need to kill Ony 50 more times to get that helm!
---
You realize by not having the weapon skill you also lose 10% white hit damage? 3% hit alone wont help.
---
Yeah anyone who has gone against a premade will be in for a really bad time. They're almost always coordinated and in full gear with a good comp. The closest way to winning is convincing your whole pug to stop spawning so they stop instakilling everyone at the graveyard
---
Whirlwind Axe at 31. Herod's Ravager from SM Arm. Diabolic Skewer is from ZF. Maraudon Princess Maul or Gatorbite Axe from Rotgrip. BRD Angerforge at approx 55 for another 2H weapon.
---
After that, you start itemizing for level 60 gear.
---
&gt; I think the genius in cartoony graphics was that they were easier on processors,
---
That really doesn't work like that.
---
So you don't actually have a point, I'm just wrong because you say so.
---
Got it.
---
It doesn't harm me and some other people really enjoy it.
---
I found out about the AV mount halfway through the rep grind. I'll admit I slightly regretted it once I found out, but I think the Swift Grey wolf will ultimately look better with an Undead anyway.
---
At the very least, it'll stand as a monument to my horrible objective priorities.
---
This site is incomplete and/or outdated, I checked my server and I know of six raiding guilds off the top of my head that aren't even listed including my own. Two of the guilds missing I know have had MC on farm since week 3 of release.
---
lol but they won't. leaving their safe zone is against the nature of those who participate in such fuckery.
---
&gt;unless you're implying only alliance from every realm transferred off to heartseeker.
---
That's kinda what happened after the second round of transfers. Alliance on all of the 40/60 servers jumped ship and made heartseeker get to something like 85:15 alliance:horde. 
---
&gt;The only thing that caused faction imbalance is not implementing faction specific queues.
---
You could do queues like that but ultimately servers are never going to be balanced. Going back to heartseeker as an example, there are a lot of differences in playstle between the factions. Alliance tend to shy away from PVP whereas horde are constantly out in groups killing people a lot lower lvl than them. 
---
You could have a perfect 50/50 server but if the majority of one faction just wants to PvE and sit in a capital it'll still seem unbalanced when it comes to wPvP.
---
A guy I was running with got SGC on his 6th run.
---
It's not actually happening tho...
---
Extra 15 at best assuming you're using the lava dredger
---
You are clueless about the glancing blow damage reduction
---
They are using a unit frames addon.
---
Shadowed unit frames got this function for example
---
Do we have any official confirmation of a GM saying it is or it isn't? Or have you actually read the full ToS?
---
wasnt the only hunter on daggerspine with a TF lol.
---
good ol Baboon
---
Yeah it feels like a slight horde bias on numbers, but alliance seem far more organised and eager to PvP that it feels really balanced.
---
There’s only one clueless person here and it’s not me
---
Yup, SWG had some really interesting dynamics.  Had a buddy who was one of the best armorcrafters on one of the servers and that's really all he did.  Spent all his time selling armor, and coordinating purchasing resources for creating the armor.
---
Yes, that's a joke about how everyone will blame blizzard for any of others and most prevalent complaint will be about queues.
---
That’s how we do it. You /roll and if pug wins they get the item. If raid wins it’s distributed according to DKP. Works great.
---
The small Whelps south in Dustwallow Marsh, gives you decent gold aswell since the Flame Sacs sell for a decent amount
---
/use \[mod:shift,@mousover,help,nodead\]\[mod:shift,@player\]  Healing Wave(Rank 7 ) ; \[@mousover,help,nodead\]\[@player\]  Healing Wave(Rank 10)
---
Its really good for warriors in PVP, but the fact that there no way to get +2h Mace skill , 2h Fury raiding on horde side you need to sacrifice some nice items for 3% extra hit, even then ur still getting 35% dmg penalty on ur glancing compared to the 15% penalty from +5 wep skill.
---
Data access and synchronization has a relatively high cost no matter how you do it, document stores aren’t magic. For the most part they just hide time at the file system tree traversal step rather than getting rid of it anyway. If Blizzard decided at the beginning that it was worth the IO delay to get accurate numbers for this, there are a number of ways they could have stored the numbers to be more convenient for this calculation, sure. But they didn’t and at this point it would be an enormous investment in time and resources for a tiny benefit.
---
Maybe even alcor's sunrazor + FR offhand? We must get more ridiculous!
---
/cast [mod:shift, @mouseover] Healing Wave(Rank 1)

It would make sense financially but Blizzard always finds some way to make us all scratch our heads
---
oh haha I got you. I'm in a raid guild, and the leader is practically begging me to join a raid team. I just don't feel like committing to being there at certain times twice a week right now
---
Tbh both are still just a big waste of time.
---
This sounds like an "Am I An Asshole" post. Everybody sucks here. As Alliance, I don't doubt for one second that some of my brethren will camp and farm the horde on occasion. 99% of my time is spent running to or from a dungeon, so I don't see all the gank-squads from my faction taking out the horde. That being said, Alliance hasn't held Searing Gorge / Blackrock Mountain for more than an hour since Phase 2 dropped.
---
I mean even with some lazy but efficient rested exp dungeon spamming you would get to 60 by now. Either you are bad or you are bad.
---
Aww shit, I don't even remember that site any more.
---
They're like the Burning Legion, plundering one world and moving on to the next.
---
Morons wanted no changes, and racials are primarily what causes imbalance.
---
Yes, it matters, please name one. Bonus points if that's not the server from the list of TRANSFER PLEASE IT'S OVERPOPULATED warnings from blizzard since it's kinda stupid to complain about your server being overpopulated after warning to transfer yet staying to play there.
---
I’m at work and on reddit....but I like classic so maybe I’m a unicorn :(
---
With the population dropped so low they will most likely open up transfers for those remaining or merge it completely.  Hang in there.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info.
---
Is there a specific type of mob you're looking to grind?
---
The cave directly south of Kargath has a bunch of ogres and you can usually can farm here without competing for mobs.  If you're a skinner, you could go to STV and farm mobs around the arena.  Lots of raptors/panthers/etc in the 40-42 range.
---
Honestly have no idea. It’s really weird, but it works :D
---
&gt; That's the kinda shit we who enjoy wpvp live for.
---
the once-a-week encounter, if you're lucky, that take place in somewhat fair setting?
---
ya, i'll take BGs over that.
---
Many of us realize this mate. You have our empathy because we are dealing with the same issue. There will just be more people complaining about horse because the dominating faction is more perportinal to that faction.
---
/who, are they in a BG already? Yes? Queue time, bois.
---
You said ALL, I said they won't as in ALL will not.
---
Flawless logic. Someone get this man on talk radio!

No-one realised it's a CTRL click yet?

[0/5/46](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-5-552350510553151)  This one gives the most healing output.
---
[0/12/39](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-5120202-550300510553151) This one gives less healing output but provides better buffs to melee, so you might want to run this spec as well.
---
[30/0/21](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55000135030215--0523031100501) This is the hybrid elemental build if you want to run it.
---
I'm levelling my pally like normal. It's taking longer due to camps/ganks, but getting there a lot faster than 'grinding dungeons/45 mins wait and run to entrance'
---
I found that I was out of mana faster than 1.5 mins, granted I was unbuffed and didn't have the best gear at the time, but for wiggle room I think it's better to just use a concussion shot if necessary and wait for the mana pot when you're oom.
---
That is always an interesting factor.
---
You want to play this spec? You have to chase all these scattered items to make it work. 
---
It definitely makes the achievement more rewarding, and makes you a bit of a spectacle on your server to boot. Seeing that Enhancement Shaman with Crown of Destruction, Hand of Rag, Gladiator's Chain, etc. is always impressive.
---
While I enjoy that aspect to a certain degree, I do feel like certain classes could have more options available from a base line. Not necessarily every spec being viable in every aspect of the game. But just more viability. As an example, each of the three Warrior specs are the uncontested best in the game at what they do. Compare that to Shamans where Resto is great for raid healing. Enhancement is generally subpar (80% of the time) throughout all aspects at high levels, even with gear. Elemental is decent at pvp and subpar in everything else. Gear could be made to mitigate a great many of these issues, but at that point, the entire class outside of Resto is only competitive if you get specific gear made to compensate for inherent class issues.
---
Great price. Double on my server.
---
Right on. Let me log on later when I get off of work and pull up the realm lists.
---
that wouldn't even "slow ranking" at all lol
---
holy are you a prophet of all things wow, have you been looking everywhere and monitoring all interactions in the game? Holy shit
---
Found the min-max'er
---
Not sure how naive you think I am but I fully understand that a truly fair fight is nearly impossible in world pvp. If you revisit the context we were talking specifically about respecting 1v1s which sometimes people do, and sometimes people don't. 
---
&gt;PVP servers were never about fairness, they're about freedom to play and interact with other players without artificial restriction.
---
I didn't say PVP servers were about fairness. I said that some of us still want to be as fair as possible even in an unfair world. People have been fair to me enough for me to believe that it exists on a large, if minority scale
---
Love vanilla overall, i played on private server for 4 years or so, everytime a new server opened and the previous one die i rerolled and have a great time everytime playing with americans. Now whit classic i was happy to finally be able to play with people from my own region, then i form a guild becouse i know everything that there is to know about vanilla, then it comes, i fucking hate people from region, they are whining, dont follow the rules, ninja looters on random grps, lootwhores, are under shady things like gold selling, account selling, ETC ETC it has been alot of drama and im very exhausted. I regret not rolling on another server with my priviate server friends.   
---
I love the game but im sick of the people im force to play with.
---
Who ever made this, is a legend.
---
 Aye i made you spy list. I agree the safespotting thing is dumb. my guild (SPACEFORCE) just switches from house to house makes it more fun and entertaining for both factions.  This holding civilian thing is silly tho we kno and mark all civilians so i dunno who u guys are trying to bait/fool. shout out to Diddy for wasting his time all night and never flagging xD scared lil bitch.
---
I don't screen cap everything I see or do in the game to prove anything to people online.
---
Bit early to be making this meme since hunters are absolutely smoking Ony and Rag each week.
---
In \~7 months... we'll see.
---
I use F1, F2, F3.  
---
But I rarely use them explicitly.  Rather I have change stance bound to certain abilities.  Trying to keep numbers to similar things across each stance.
---
2 swaps to battle stance and uses charge.
---
Ctrl+2 swaps to berserker stance and casts intercept.  
---
5, battle stance and overpower.  
---
Ctrl+5 defensive stance and revenge.  
---
0 defensive stance and taunt.  
---
Ctrl+0 battle stance and mocking blow.  
---
6 serker stance and pummel.  
---
Ctrl+6 defensive stance, equip shield, shield bash.
---
Something like that anyway..
---
Sucks for the 20 people or so that we’re on vacation, didn’t know to transfer, and cane home to a completely dead server
---
50g crafting fee on kurinaxx, have like 6 peeps who can make it. Mats should run somewhere around 700g definately worth the investment since u would only ever take it off for pvp if u want the 45 stam on t2. The material price will likely go up, crafting cost will fluxuate a bit but gold will be less valuable later due to inflation. Imo its the best investment u can make on a warrior
---
This would be like getting bullied in high school, graduating and the same bullies go to the college you choose and they just keep on bullying you again.
---
Because a naked gnome dancing is art
---
Mage port gives honorless target for 30 seconds, good for griefing but probably not great for honor.
---
No, u. Idk if its just my server but it mostly takes 1-2 deaths from gadgetzan to zf and 4-10 deaths to brd which is about 15 minutes. I mean if you don‘t have the time to run 4-5 exp runs + 15 minutes, then I just can not feel sorry for you.
---
Oh ok. You're just a crazy person. Have a swell day.
---
are we complaining about game dev decisions that were made in 2004 lol
---
Dude maybe on your server.  I'm skeram where alliance is camped hard but dont think it's better for horde on heartseeker.  It's not an ally vs horde thing.  It's a majority vs minority thing.
---
&gt;they can get more H/hr running BGs
---
That's not necessarily true though.  At least in Vanilla it wasn't.
---
Okay, then I am wrong with this one.
---
Alex Jones could use a sidekick.
---
Yes.... Wave.
---
AV's my favorite BG, with AB as second. WSG is...repetitive. I have nothing against CTF gameplay, but it's one fairly small map, over and over and over again. 
---
It's a great deal less painful to get exalted with AV than with WSG.
---
Fuck it, I think Spinal is awesome for PvP.  Kill someone and get rage? That’s going to be sick for BGs.  Plus, you have a big dick weapon for BGs, you made the right call dude.
---
I mean, it's kind of annoying when I'm healing too. If the tank's got all the aggro, I watch one health bar, and occasionally press heal. Boring, fast, efficient runs. Hell yeah. 
---
If the DPS is peeling aggro off my tank, then I've gotta watch 5 people's healthbars, including my own. Not a fan, and that's how wipes happen. Expensive, slow, high-intensity runs. 
---
If you're bored as a healer, ask your tank to pull multiple packs at once. It's a better solution than DPS trying to tank, lol.
---
Hunter is insane, I don't think people realise the amount of spells and utility a hunter has
---
I typically dont engage people who write "Everyone enjoy a thing the way I want you to" threads but, I'll bite:
---
&gt; I feel like I'm really in the minority as someone who's just playing the game. 
---
I don't think this is necessarily accurate, but it is very obvious that there are way more min-maxers in Classic than Vanilla. The playerbase is much more informed now. That's not the same as a no-lifer.  Bunch of us are dads that work full-time, have families, and only have a few hours a handful of nights a week to play.  That means the time we do have, we aim to be efficient. 
---
&gt;  I haven't looked up a BIS list...&lt;all the other things people complain about on reddit&gt;
---
That seems like willful ignorance.  You have time to sub here and read post after post of circle jerking, surely you have the time time to read about what items you should be trying to acquire, even if its just to learn more about your class and stat prioritization. Bedisdes, f you are only wanting to experience wow casually, why even mention and list all the things you learned about on reddit that you don't care to do in game.
---
&gt; I am chasing a dream, an illusion. I'm chasing a wow filled with adventure and meaningful interactions with likeminded players 
---
It's not a dream. Find a casual guild. It doesn't require a ton of effort.
---
You had expectations, they weren't accurate. It happens. Reroll on a PVE or RP server, or move on to something else to spend your leisure time doing, hopefully that involves not telling others how to spend theirs.
---
If they get it.
---
Okay... so instead of merging servers we just have them share the same world.
---
blizzard absolutely fucked those people over lol not sure why you're mad at them
---
alliance victim complex posting consuming all possible conversation on any and all forums wasn't a thing until Cata iirc
---
NO CHANGES
---
Yeaaaaah maybe youre playing your hunter wrong. Right now we are the bees knees. Further down the road while everyone else is getting stronger and we stay the same, then this is an applicable meme.
---
Yes, there are a number of ways the data structures could have been designed to do it more efficiently, but no matter which you use it needs to be read and synchronized, which takes a relatively long time for a real-time application like WoW. But the fact is they didn’t and it would take an enormous investment in time and resources to change that, for very little benefit.
---
Because this subreddit is currently predominantly populated by tribalistic toxic crybabies and people who're upset that classic exists to begin with.
---
The narrative is that all horde are whiny children who only play horde because "OP racials" let them gank poor victimized alliance 5v1 all day.
---
Anyone who disagrees or offers an alternative perspective or a more nuanced assessment can at best hope to be completely ignored and at worst be harrassed and dogpiled by people who feel that their poor experiences in-game (that the other side totally doesn't deal with, like, ever!) make them morally justified in being uninhibitedly vicious toward dissenters.
---
/r/classicwow is a glorified political subreddit, except with an azerothian coat of paint.
---
- Same vicious cycle of downvoting things that break the narrative and upvoting things that reinforce the narrative until a rigid echo chamber is formed
---
- Same behavior of people assuming that every sentiment they dislike is coming from the exact group they dislike, even when they have no rational reason to believe that is the case.
---
- Same discussion strategy of boiling down the "opponents" comment into bite-sized bits that have very little to do with what they actually said, and then using canned one-liners to insult and dismiss them. (Someone said horde players can't level past 50 either with all the alliance gank squads? LOL\#NOCHANGES! YOU ASKED FOR THIS WHINY CRYBABY)
---
etc etc
---
I think yhe stam booze is BoP, is it not?
---
Is it allowed for sure? Just before I go in and actually see if anyone wants to offer for it.
---
I don't really get what you mean.  What is your concept of role play?  Role play just means you can pretend to be your character.  The reality is, is that it's not much different from a regular pvp server. I played on both servers you mentioned and don't rp, but think it's cool when others do.  There's a few active people that host events (DD had a "dance party" the other night).  Grobb rp was more about pvp - sacking the enemy cities and stuff (and has more hardcore players). DD is more laid back.
---
Threat increases with every rank, I would definitely upgrade it.
---
Even though I'm on a pvp server? I'm trying to think if I have ever been able to tab onto a neutral enemy, like critters
---
The large majority of servers was down to one layer before layering was completely removed. It was a handful of realms that had to be forcibly phased to 1 layer. 
---
Your average player wasn’t layer hopping. Your average player is having a bad time getting rocked in phase 2.  
---
My comparison to retail works really well here, because it’s easy to shard hop on retail. The incentives still completely killed war mode when they were too good.
---
Come join us. Don't think of it like 'moving', think of it like having a 'summer home' you go to visit when it gets a bit too chilly for you at your 'main home'.

Agility and mongoose do not stack, u can get both buffs to appear but if u check ur stats u are only getting 25 agi from the mongoose and none from the agi potion.

Hola, Don Julio.
---
Can you share the feign death shadowmeld macro?
---
10 hours is way too few hours per day for R14 too lol
---
But there isn't really a "problem". Horde get camped a ton by alliance on Herod. Like I've gotten camped in BRM way more than horde have had control. Like way more.
---
Its garbage for Ret in PvP. It's proc breaks repentance.
---
I love your work - was looking at this one and was trying to remember who I saw that made the realistic SFK one, turns out that was you too!
---
Looking forward to seeing more of your work
---
E = Battle Stance
---
Scroll up = Berserker Stance
---
Scroll Down = Defensive Stance
---
But all my abilities that require a certain stance automatically swaps me to correct stance
---
I too enjoy standing around doing nothing on my mount except looking flashy.
---
I played on a private server where you could fill out surveys for "server points" that could be used for things like flasks. Did surveys on 4 accounts and got like 8 flasks a week.
---
No shit. Welp, it seems I’ve been bamboozled.
---
Come to incendius, our faction balance is close to equal with a small horde favor so we could def use some more alliance guilds. There aren’t ques very often anymore, but when there are they’re generally pretty short. 
---
Our WPVP is actually really fun too. Different factions control different areas and these enormous groups form up and just go at it. It’s especially fun in searing gorge/black rock/burning steppes area.
---
Lol people really getting hung up on this safespotting stuff.  You've got like a raid and a half of people *inside your main city*, but you're concerned about them standing somewhere an irrelevant guard can't reach?  There are plenty of spots to be where you won't have to deal with guards, that's not the issue. The issue is that alli don't have the people to prevent this from happening in the first place - and that is completely Blizzards fault, nobody else.
---
[Don't act like the sweaty alli on this server are any less scummy either](https://gyazo.com/fbf878377d7f0cdc615ae212c2f63d67).
---
Haha yeha and get ganked every time on any warmaster by a druid/rogue squad ;D
---
Would I still be able to tank low level dungeons with kitty talents without much issues?
---
Got HoJ my second time killing Angerforge.
---
What's it like during prime time? There's probably not many people on my crowded server on a weekday morning
---
Luckly the transfer was open already for 2 months -.-
---
Having a fantastic time as a Troll Priest. No complaints.
---
People who complain here about faction balance need to move their complaints to Blizzards official forums. People make posts here as if they're talking directly to blizzard.
---
Whats Blizzards response to this shtshow?
---
If your tank is struggling, you can have a pet hold a mob that is not getting focused first, but they will not hold aggro off a real dps. Put a protection scroll on them and they can stand up to some damage.
---
I remember on a private server, where the adds spawned way faster on final boss of Uldaman, we had a hunter bear pet hold the boss while we just killed adds xd.
---
Bear druids had very little change from 1.12 to TBC.  They had just gotten such a bad rap from when they were absolute trash in early Vanilla that no one wanted to bring them in late Vanilla.  The meta was already set that druids were only for healing.
---
If the tank dies, it's the healer's fault.
---
If the healer dies, it's the tank's fault.
---
If dps die, it's their fault.
---
&gt; not known in the past
---
&gt; play unhealthy amounts, cheat or acct share
---
This is exactly how it worked "in the past" lol
---
Truuuue, but you should have your guild buy your dinner for you now before they fuck you.
---
it's really not funny man.  It's not a meme and it shows just how bad and toxic you players are.  PvP is super fun - i love it.  But when it Pv..... it's only half a game.  I understand honor farming (i was rank 13 once in vanilla) but this is a broken game being played by broken players.
---
Depends what people want to do. I personally need exalted with AB for my BiS tanking shoulders. Some people want rank 14 weapons to do better in raids. Some people just want rank 14 for the status. Or they just want to have OP gear and run around pvping.
---
This is the reality of this forum lately.  Butthurt allies acting like they are all on Flamelash 5/95 server when most are on 40/60 and just suck at pvp.
---
So if we know that alliance is whiny babies, can we also acknowledge that horde is full coward edgelords or does this only swing one way ?
---
I never realized this but you are 100% right.  I see a single target, move in, and 100 enemies spawn behind him.  RIP.
---
Yep.
---
Everyone, alliance and horde, that's thriving in the current environment (or tolerant enough that they can work around it until BGs come out) are in-game.
---
End result is that the overwhelming majority of people who're speaking up here are outraged.
---
I never claimed they were “true” numbers, but it gives an idea of the ratio of Horde/Alliance. Only Blizz has the true, accurate numbers anyway.
---
The problem is your DPS is getting better weapons and gear too, and fights are artificially lasting longer because they have to hold back. Any pressure you mitigate on your healers by stacking mitigation, as your raid gears up, becomes extra pressure back on the healers because DPS needs to hold back to not pull threat. This makes fights last longer, more heals needed, more mana used, etc.
---
The goal of a tank in a raid should be to allow their DPS to go as hard as possible while not dying. If you are soaking up 75% of the damage you take but generating garbage threat, your healers are doing worse overall than if you just let your DPS end the fight in 60 seconds.
---
The best way to tank bosses is to let your DPS kill them.
---
I do believe that even some of the devs have said that they don't like flying, and/or that it was a mistake to ever introduce it
---
I did this back in vanilla. “Rajaxx” wow progress said: 0.16:1 A:H it was also  the 3th smallest. XD
---
 #nochanges
---
Let blizzard start messing around with things and soon we have flying mounts and LFR. Just leave the game alone
---
It doesn't work as easily as it did on pservers but it IS possible to trigger crit-reactive abilities.  Check it out on youtube it's pretty easily searchable with reck bombs or warrior enrage
---
I died 5 times on my way to brd yesterday, as horde, and it's not the first time. The factions just take turns to control different areas it seems.
---
From what I've seen, there needs to be a minimum of 300 people in the honor system for r14 to even be possible. There aren't even that many 60s left.
---
horde... bad?
---
upvotes to the left!
---
Of course, if you find yourself underperforming you can always throw a few points into the more bear related talents but you shouldn't have any issues up until the later dungeons aka brd and up.
---
You know what's crazier than a moonkin with Sulfuras? You've got 3 different addons telling you the vendor price.
---
Hey guys I’m thinking about leaving!
---
&gt;accepts a free shit
---
Actually maybe I’m staying! The community is great!
---
&gt;continues to accept free shit
---
Actually I’m leaving!
---
OMEGALUL
---
And get put against a premade
---
Hahahaha
---
There are no serious raids in classic...
---
So what's the point in not bringing them? 30 sec faster clear time?
---
Melee have to constantly move in and out on Rag. Hunters can stand there and don't even have to worry about threat.
---
Ony spends P2 out of melee range.
---
Look at Golemagg if you want a measuring stick imo.
---
Literally dozens of us!
---
I'm playing a druid on classic and I'm also functioning as guild pet.
---
I'm 28 now though...
---
Except things have changed so much. Everyone is try hard now. All fights are gank fests, no one respects the 1 v 1. I have yet to meet someone who does not have engineering. Even the sacred druid code no longer exists - which held even on private servers.
---
Classic is so toxic now. The true spirit of the old school MMO is dead.
---
Could to know. Still had a minor panic attack!
---
So.. Ion was right?
---
hand of rag on a mage too, nice
---
only 6k? mats must be real cheap where you come from.
---
Bears are awesome 5 man tanks and we actually have a druid main tank our MC runs each week.  Granted hes geared out and full consumes minus flask.   Remember that tanks are a hot commodity so you will always get groups and second you should always play what is the most fun for you.   Good luck dude, as a hybrid I love hyping up other hybrids.
---
I can observe that you're abit touchy about this
---
Yeah I thought I saw the original also
---
Pay Blizzard to fix a problem they created in the first place?  NO WAY.
---
Also, transfers will make the balance issue worse.  Wont happen (even with Activision's greed, they just cant do it, it will mess up the game so much).
---
&gt;  just respect the 1v1
---
Fucking LOL.
---
On most servers i been on /lookingforgroup is more popular anyway? And official so no “admins” beside Blizz
---
Once upon a time guilds did this some. It was always referred to as cascading on my server Laughing Skull. Had to do with passing raid lead around but I do not know much past that.
---
If the devs at blizz didn't want it we wouldn't have it.
---
People made way too big a deal out of  "You think you do, but you don't"  which was an off the cuff answer to an unscreened question by one guy. People act like it became the official stance of Blizzard and they repeated it as a mantra when in reality it was simply a genuine opinion of one person. Which frankly at the time of asking I doubt wowclassic would be wowclassic if he was like "yea we're dropping it next year"
---
PvP. Back in Vanilla I played PvE and there were alot more women around, I guess that's why.
---
If you're on a pvp server but in horde territory, which Org is, then any alli will be auto-flagged there and horde won't. While you're unflagged, you won't be able to tab target alliance or even hit them with your aoe abilities. These only really apply for faction cities and low level zones, since on a pvp server pretty much any higher level zone will be contested territory and have both factions auto-flagged at all times.
---
private was better
---
still decent tho
---
How are you querying the total numbers I don't see an option for that? Is there a way to download the data to make it easier to query? How are you comparing between servers? I don't see an option.
---
Depends on server our guild got horde second 2 pattern on our server. The first guy was asking 300-400g a craft. We setup ours priced at 200g individual or 150g for bulk crafts 3 or more. I know they’ve made well over 2k gold so far.
---
Your casters need to manage better and use cc when possible... They need to help not steal aggro. (caster speaking)
---
No it’s PVP, I can see why people want to xfer to pve servers though.
---
48 shaman tank here. Yanked every dungeon to date minus stocks and Gnomer and its entirely possible but made easier if you’re in the upper end of the level bracket for the dungeon. Never even used 2H weapons I just form the dungeon groups as a tank. If people get invited and they don’t wanna run with a shaman tank, they know how to leave. Like I said now at level 48 I’ve only ever had 2 people leave because of the fact that I was a shaman tank, and they were both getting invited for the same Wailing Caverns run. WC lol. Just tanked ZF the other day with an all-caster group and it was a breeze. Next up is Maraudon and then ST in a few levels and I’m really excited honestly it’s more challenging but more fun as well
---
As for the comments Lower in this thread, it’s actually extremely useful to have someone else or a pet be able to tank one of the mobs so the Dps can nuke it and then move on to the others. Since shaman tanks struggle with aoe threat MIGHTILY, having the time to be able to tab target 3 mobs and build up steady threat while a dps warrior or hunter/lock pet tanks a 4th is actually extremely useful and dare I say ~meta~
---
I understand the warrior threat and rage mechanics, but losing threat on a singular mob shouldn’t screw an entire pull, if anything it should make it easier. Shamans can take the hits too if at your level as they’re wearing Mail now
---
TL:DR don’t panic if a shaman pulls threat. You’re absolutely right in saying that they shouldn’t be using rockbiter if they’ve knowingly joined a group as dps, but if they don’t want to swap to windfury then just adapt what you’re doing accordingly. Have them tank the mob 5m away so it can be separated from the rest of the pull for dps purposes but also close enough to take advantage of ravages procs or something. If you want the traditional 1/1/3 dungeon makeup, we have retail for that. Classic is all about making things work with what you’ve got, so embrace it
---
Exactly.  The responsibility is on Blizzard.  HTF are they supposed to grow the player base with things like this going on?????????
---
It was from my backpack, which is always setup to be general stuff I loot over the course of my session. Odds are it was probably grey vendor trash, animal meat, a soul shard or some other herbs.
---
This Moonkin was so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
---
On pservers, you could do the green ray animation in all dungeons.
---
Many servers are at the point Flamelash was at prior to their mass exodus. Only reason Herod and other similar servers have any Alliance left on it is the fact the Alliance can't leave.
---
Yall just throw away 10 days played like that? Damn lol. Ive just unsubbed for the time being
---
I leveled as feral and found it easier to spam dungeons as much as possible since as a tank we have a much easier time getting groups. Here's what I did:
---
Finish off ST completely and get done uld runs in.  If you need some more XP do a bit of desolace or dustmallow. Once you get to mid-40s do all of Tanaris and run ZF as much as you can. In your late 40s start going to Mara, keep running this until you get the princess ring,  even into your 50s. Around 50 go do homeowners and especially make sure you get the Guard Captain trinket from the elite quests.  Once you're 50, start getting ST runs,  your BiS shoulders are here.  At 52/53 start doing BRD arena/prison runs, lots of XP there. By your mid-50s you should do most of BRD, and be doing full clears by 56/7ish (depends more on the rest of your group at that point,  especially a healer who can keep up with emperor damage). In your late 50s start running LBRS and make sure to at least start all your attunements for MC/UBRS/Ony. At this point you should be close to 60 and finish off with some DM and LBRS runs,  and you'll have all 52+ level zone quests to do for fat gold.
---
But, is this not how it is on their internal 1.12 client?  
---
I think you are just complaining about something that existed and was complained about back in 2004.  This is how the game was played back then and people would bitch about it on the forums and mmo-c.  
---
Now, the wow team have changed a lot of aspects about vanilla to create the current sprinkled vanilla experience we have.  But, speaking specifically to whether or not this is true, with out a blue post to back me up as a source, I am pretty confident 1.12 was played like this and works like this on their internal client.
---
Every time I help take down a 60 with my level 48 in a world PVP group: YAAAAASSSS!
---
Ok mate show me a shammy tank that has sub 45 min mc clear I‘ll wait. Oh? You don‘t have any? I thought the gap between them isn‘t large? How come?
---
Lookingforgroup is more popular on rattlegore too. It'll be nice if this eliminates the split LFG channels.
---
You're going to need to explain that...  Like you swing get a proc and hit repentance before realizing the proc went off?  Doesn't repentance break on damage?
---
That doesn't seem like garbage.
---
Does counterweight affect attack speed in bear/cat form?
---
Really enjoying it.  Played TBC to WotLK back in the day but never got to experience the original game.  No private server experience.
---
I joined a guild through this sub a few months before launch which made all the difference.  We went from being able to down the first 4 bosses of MC over the course of a 3 hour raid a couple months ago, to clearing all of MC plus Ony in one night with time to spare.
---
40 man raids are amazing to experience and Discord makes it so much easier to organize stuff and voice chat. I also became a first time guild officer, which has been loads of fun.  
---
I'm Horde on a PvP server but I don't really farm or give a shit about honor so the  wPvP imbalance hasn't affected or bothered me in the slightest.
---
Overall, Classic has met and exceeded my expectations.  It fulfills the fantasy of going back in time to an earlier point in your life while retaining all of the knowledge you've gained since the first time around.  I got a second chance, and I'm finally doing it "right."
---
Interesting brag
---
I don't know what that means.
---
she's running out the door
---
honorspy does this
---
In my book, Scholo is the single hardest 5-man dungeon in the game. The mobs are tightly packed, pats take non-linear paths, and casters make things even trickier. My recommendation for casters is to ask a mage (if you have one) to counterspell. Otherwise, you are stuck doing LoS pulls, which isn’t always an option. I find that the casters don’t pour out a ton of damage, so you could also just tank the melee mobs and ask your dps to burn down the caster (if it’s a single mob).
---
For the multi-caster groups in the room with 6 bone piles (and necromancers), I’ve had some luck charging in (if your group is all 60s) without aggroing the other groups. I actually do this part with a 2H since most dmg is not physical. Just tell your group to watch out for the other groups and to avoid using pets/minions.
---
i am. but then i see them again the next day. same with bots. reported a bot for a week and next week it was still there. though i gotta admit i havent seen it this week but hey.. might ve also just changed location.
---
Also i think in dungeon burst is better than consistency. Especially in low level dungeon when no mobs live more than 10secs. It’s important to burst down cloth caster, if wf procs on a cloth it’s pretty much one shot, helps out your tank a lot that way. I also i dont understand why some shamans use earth strike instead of frost shock? Does earth strike do more dmg?
---
That’s perfect take your time so by the time your 60 they got shit on farm and you can swoop in for the lewts.
---
This. At least for the first few weeks/months, plenty of pve players will be queueing for BGs just for rep rewards
---
Somewhat miss us gamers back then
---
ZF for the leveling!
---
There were numerous talent changes within classic. It's likely that if things had continued onward as Classic+ rather than introducing TBC, we would have still gotten basic balancing updates.
---
I didnt like a number of things. Classes were alright. Although i'd say getting rid of debuff slots would fix a lot problems.
---
I don't see why it wouldn't be. It's not like you're trading real world goods.
---
People have different opinions on that but either way the salt is guaranteed from one side or another.
---
It is though when you run DPS tests and iterations over a long sample.  The extra bonus is that rockbiter does not have a huge overkill amount, the same way windfury proccing at the end of the fight will overkill by a large amount.
---
"mention of a player being woman"
---
yeah it doesn't have quite the same ring to it. /u/Esarus, thoughts?
---
Yep
---
Mm Thats hot.
---
I have found the villain here.. it was a stupid addon called ReagentCounter, all it does is showing how many blinds / vanish reagents on my actionbar.. removed it an voila! back to stable fps
---
Yeah that dude has no idea what he is talking about. Shit even the blue pvp set is better than t2 for a lot of specs in pvp cause it's so well itemized FOR pvp. 
---
Any warriors or shadow priests running around in full t2 are basically painting themselves as a free kill. Nevermind how great the gear is for hybrids.
---
Is something like (this)[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVhxdhbq0ucZxbus0M] crazy for someone looking to do BGs and improve their sword and shield tanking for end game content?
---
It's going to be with BWL as this is just going to be BGs and not Phase 3 official.

---
So giving away a weapon that could benefit a ranking group to a 1v1 duel meme is beneficial to who exactly?
---
I don't believe queues are faction based. It has been requested by the community but I've found no evidence that it actually is implemented.
---
Ranking is a good point, however there's diminishing returns: here's [a post that explains it well](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e6ohlu/the_last_remaining_members_of_flamelashalliance/f9spma2/). TLDR is that higher ranks are impossible if there's not enough players participating.
---
I agree, but I think the DS stacks? That might be useful in some situations...
---
Doesn't seem worth it.
---
I mean, the guy you’re responding to seems to be assuming WSG will be dominated by premades, and if that’s true maximum efficiency would absolutely not be the only reason a PUG would want to avoid it.
---
Git gud. 
---
And by that I mean but a spyglass.
---
I'm glad he's enjoying it! But i'm pretty sure this was a karma grab due to all the "i hate this game" posts recently.
---
Mara. You do the scepter tele and pull all the eles and worms to the pool and aoe em all down. Then kill the goblin and reset.
---
The bear tank in our guild is great at tanking and absolutely destroys the damage meters when he's in cat form and switches gear,  so I don't think you'll need to  sacrifice tanking ability for cat dps.
---
a few items that have just +healing spells will do you good, along with the regular int/spirit/spell power. +healing specific items usually have double if not triple the +spell damage (affects damage spells and healing spells) and usually no stats on them. So you dont want to be decked entirely in +healing or your mana pool and regen will be terrible, but a few choice pieces with big bonuses will make your heals much more potent, and therefore save your mana pool. You also should familiarize yourself with downranking a few healing spells. This way you can throw out very cheap heals continually, or choose a big bomb heal at much greater mana cost
---
Great info!
---
Well...who the hell plays in the morning tho?
---
No the deeprun tram is the furthest distance you can charge but it’s a pain to set up as you need a person of the opposite faction to move on to tram in same frame that A) tram moves away and B) your charge actives due to spell batching.
---
I don't remember those being a thing. I don't remember or know of anyone actually paying them gold. I do know of several people who tried it, and failed.
---
Sustained
---
That's exactly what % are used for haha. Being relevant regardless of scale, he did not get it.
---
THEY DID IT ON THEIR OWN
---
Can only tab to hostile targets (red) by default iirc.
---
It definitely does happen on both sides.  And it's shitty people don't understand what I'd call responsible pvp.  I think the main reason you see more of these posts is because a majority of the pvp servers are horde dominated, at least what most sites are showing.
---
True, I mean I wouldnt say no to a hand of rag if given to me. I'm sure it's fun running around as a boomie and whacking people.
---
But what good is being a Rank 14 on a server with nothing to do and no groups to run with?    I mean I guess you could do it and then shelve your toon and hope for another server transfer or server merge or something after you've gotten your purple gear.

Or....now hear me out....Horde being colossal assholes? See, that is just as terrible an arguement as "crybaby allies." 
---
The general problem is servers are way too large and the general gamer mentality has shifted from asshole streamer influence. Take ninja looting, rarely happened and heavily discouraged. Now it's becoming common practice. PvP servers are cancer for everyone now. Anyone who played back in the day will tell you the mentality of the players is the difference.

ugg it literally says "... for 1 minute" in the description.

They couldn't be bother to read the rest of the sentence, but they made a post about it to ask.

leaving windseeker was a good move imo
---
Dont pretend fairbanks is anywhere near this bad. I'm alliance on FB and it's annoying when people cry like where flamelaah, skeram or stalaag.  Were outnumber 59 to 41 at 60 in the last 7 days. That's bad but the horde on our server suck and there are 8 raid groups worth just in fury. 
---
Theres no time where we dont control feralas, dire maul, felwood and we highly contest strat.
---
You're crying about rogues in IF but type /who org and under city and you see all our top rank rogues. We have multiple rogues at portals, major city flight points and kargath.  Laps has a group that sits about undercity elevators all day. Despite being a number imbalanced server ( and not a bad one like 80/20 people here are talking about) we do a very good job at staying balanced.
---
You're crying about the normal pvp gank experience. Fairbanks is one of the better mega servers.
---
There is absoutely no way Mograine is 60/40, I played both as horde and alliance there and its def more like 50/50
---
Don’t bother joining this discord, anyone.

They will van you for no reason, don’t support anyone posting drama in drama channels, ban and remove memes, and make rules that they actively break

In game is usually the best
---
Herod is pretty even last I checked it was 45-55 at 60 like 10 days ago. Ally control all from camp mojache to DM, and usually control the entrance to MC and leading to brd. Horse usually control the upper levels of brm and searing gorge and lhc and epl is always in flux depending on whose out in force but I've seen it camped by ally as much as horde
---
It just trivializes so much of the world. I know every rock in vanilla and cannot say the same about any of the expansions. Sure, I know the areas right around key quests, but once flying was added, the game became about skipping as much content as possible. In addition, you have people going afk 500yds in the air. In vanilla, you are always present in the world even when you are afk. You are always open to interactions with the other faction and NPCs. Flying destoryed all of these aspects of the game.  
---
If they want to add a faster mount, that would be one thing. But lifting off into the sky to never be seen or touched until you reach your objective really cheapened the experience of a consistent open world.
---
It says the site uses warcraft logs to get its data. If non-raiders never log, how do you get a percentage of non-raiders to raiders?
---
Marking targets and LoS pulls seem to work well.
---
Who down ranks pre 60? Every bit of reading I ever did showed downranking after more than a few hundred in +healing gear, which isn't feasible without decent gear.
---
I've been actively pvping on Mograine since before p2 launch and overall, horde absolutely dominate the pvp scene. Sometimes allies will briefly take control of areas but for the most part, SG, BRM, and BS are horde-owned, as well as LHC and Everlook. Horde own these locations far more than 60% of the time.
---
I totally agree with ur list, i freaking hate dmw tank nightmare with all the caster mobs....
---
too bad it’s weeb trash
---
Make an orc shaman.

I logged into my above level 48 warrior in the gadgetzen inn.  I had my character loaded and two gnome mages inside the inn cast detect magic on me according to my combat log.  I logged out with 5 seconds left on my honorless target protection.  That was not going to be a fun experience getting killed 5 times in order to get out of the city.  Instead I played my below level 48 alt character for 3-4 hours before calling it a wrap for the night.
---
just play Morrowind.
---
Its these hyped up mega server people that are now having a shit time. They heard which servers were going to be "hot" and flocked to them. So not only do they have to deal with huge populations but also a greater percentage of those annoying "gamer" types who tend to take things too seriously. The rest of us on normal servers are having a pretty vanilla-like experience.
---
Not gonna lie, I'd be a little unsure if they hadn't already done it in Vanilla. Pretty confident this time around as they're obviously aware of the balance issues.
---
You don't have to. Just make interesting items. With toning down you could keep on for years. Naxx was on brink to break the game, only because for some reason Blizzard decided they need to add another 10ilvls on items.
---
&gt;Just a bad faction imbalance
---
Yeah but imbalances are getting worse, not better
---
Alliance tend to control a very small pocket of brm. The entire surrounding area is controlled by 4 times as many horde. Balance is no where near that close.
---
600 vs 400 is not the same as 6 vs 4.
---
No it is not and it's a way of thinking that has led to hundreds of millions of deaths. Collective guilt is one of the most dangerous fucking ideas that naive people still don't understand the pathology of.
---
People are individuals. Just because someone decided to make a horde character cause they like tauren doesn't mean they now carry responsibility for the actions random strangers that made the same 50/50 choice.
---
Haven't been on in a while. Can someone explain what's going on with the posts about alliance transferring away? I okay on Smolderweb, will this effect me?
---
Pagle had one crafter that was known. For roughly the first 1.5 months.  Their fee was 250g. When patterns were put into the AH they sold for as much as 8k as the one crafter was trying to maintain the Monopoly. Market busted now and people spam their craft macros offering to do it for free out of spite. You will probably recoup your costs slowly and faster if you idle in trade a lot.

You dont want this guy. Hes just a whiner. Fairbanks isn't one of the servers suffering right now.

You don't even have to kill the doge first w simone. Just trap the doge first and go ham on simone, then scatter, wing clip and you should be good.

The mongols were considered barbarians to the entire world but that mean words didn't stop genghis from plundering and creating 1 million descendants

Two hand arms fury sweeping strikes tanked alllll the way to mara. You don’t ever need Prot but it helps to have a shield for 55+ dungeons.
---
Add a “;healing wave” at the end of each.
---
All bosses can be taunted in MC, your tanks are bad. Even on Rag your MT/OT should coordinate a round of taunt/mocking blow/challenging shout to let you guys go all out.
---
When I asked, Maitoz said they had 90 something raiders.
---
Yeah, crazy strong guiild with a lot of hardcore raiders and pvpers
---
It’s really not. Think of it as a set and forget package.
---
getting killed randomly is not the same thing as being camped.  Go roll Ally and try to level to 60 - hit 60 then go to IF....just try to talk to an auctioneer or banker....or take a IF portal from a mage.  You will see.
---
Or download healbot and it's literally a mouse click. Way more efficient and you'll save that .25-.5 seconds that might be the difference of your partner's life or death. If you use shift/ctrl and alt you can have up to 9 spells easily done and set up in a matter of 2 minutes. No need to input these long drawn out macros where one spelling mistake fucks it all up.
---
People sign up and never show still. I take attendance into account for loot

Got both my first time stepping into BRD as a level 49 warrior

I still haven't completed the quest after multiple runs because the rest of the group always grabs the boxes and I use the one holy water I get on Baron.
---
Thottbot!
---
Are they allowed to breathe on PVP servers?
---
its not good IMO. And i have no idea what you are talking about when you say we control Dire Maul. I do a LOT of runs there and its pretty much horde camped all day. &lt;Fury&gt; has no life and they have no reason to keep camping DM in a 20 or 40 man raid. It's getting old at this point. And according to ironforge.pro we are 70/30 H to A. https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true
---
Wrong. You need a a big enough pool size to gain enough rp to hit 14. 
---
Because you need bracket 1 to hit 14
---
And bracket 1 I believe is top .1%
---
Meaning you need at least 1k people in the honor pool to open up a spot for bracket 1.
---
WoW did this in the lead up to Wrath, where if you caught the plague after a certain period of time you’d turn into a zombie, then your “job” was to try to infect as many other players as possible.
---
As time went on the plague became more and more contagious, and zombies were everywhere. 
---
If you think the crying over PvP imbalance is bad, you should have seen the WoW forums during that “experiment.” The shitty part is when you died or killed somebody else, you took durability damage, so people were paying astronomical repair bills but couldn’t get out into the world to earn the repair costs. 
---
It was a real shitshow, but goddam was it fun roleplaying a zombie.
---
Census data hasn’t been accurate since the first few weeks after launch. It’s a well known fact that there are more horde than alliance in the overall classic population, but horde definitely has the same issues on the few servers where they’re the minority.
---
Any suggestions for a balanced pve server - EST?
---
I gotta tell ya, with the 1.12 patch druid tanks are great for dungeons. Their snap aggro is great, they mitigate well, and they bring innervate.
---
How does the option even differ between the two addons?
---
What's ironic is that about half of the players on heartseeker at the moment originated on Skeram.
---
The PVE players don't have the same interest in pvp as those on PVP servers. Of course some PVE'ers will, but the majority will not. PVE servers are generally ally dominated. Horde will have queues, the only question is how bad once the initial rep grinds are over.
---
It matters for a lot. As a warrior, less damage being done to you means less rage. Less rage means less threat, less ability to hold agro. Cascades down till the pull is crazy and everyone is getting hit. 
---
Plus it's a lot easier to heal 1 person than it is 2 or more.
---
Our guild chose roll over LC/DKP because some people can’t make some nights and we don’t want drama. The problem with this is if a pug wins a roll then it doesn’t help your progress at all. Our solution has been raiding with another guild + 3 or 4 pugs until we fill out. If the other guild wins rolls it helps with the raid so it’s great. Pugs taking loot hurts my heart.
---
This is no mine! This is a Tomb!
---
Hes saying the Fight Club discord has derailed simulations of various weapons with hard numbers provided. "Feeling" like something is good does not mean it's good. That said, I personally dont think using QS as a weapon until you get a better one will be a problem. It's not like we're pushing world firsts here.
---
As fresh warrior I found the dungeons with more mobs in one pack harder, like strat live, lbrs. The more gear you get the easier it is to run through them. I've always hated scholomance and strat, altho it makes it easier having a mage to decurse, sham for WF / Pala for blessings and priests for shackle undead. Had a 3 mage group once in strat live that was fucking fast omg.
---
Scholo has a lot of PATROLS, as does strat so be careful on pulls, rest are pretty easy pull wise. DM mobs have huge aggro range.
---
Imagine bre drops and you lose next week. No guarantee you'll ever see it
---
Ragnaros is bugged right now and Wrath of Ragnaros (melee knock back) resets the ENTIRE raid's threat.
---
Once you reach the special hit cap, how is Hit valued vs. Str/AP and crit?
---
&gt;Take ninja looting, rarely happened and heavily discouraged. Now it's becoming common practice.
---
Can you please give an example of a ninja looter not getting flamed for it? Also it happened a lot in vanilla there were compilation videos of the rage resulting from ninja looting events
---
&gt; Because this subreddit is currently predominantly populated by tribalistic toxic crybabies
---
I was gonna go with the notion that the unassailable numerical advantage of one faction across 95% of pvp servers has created a problem that is so constant, unavoidable, and above all frustrating that people are naturally seeking any outlet they can find for their misery; but I'm certain that your condescending post will convince us that the proof of our own experiences was all nothing more than a collective hallucination.
---
A lot, lot, lot of time theory crafting at work using google docs, instead of playing the game and chatting on ventrillo back in 05/06.
---
yes, the changes and information gap have been extremely noticeable, but predictable.  
---
A lot less crashing, and a lot more population fall off, instead of population growth.
---
I just want my eye to drop ffs
---
First, the world pvp roaming gank raids are killing the game. A lot of people simply don't want to die 10 times just to get to their dungeon because the honor farmers have no issue corpse camping and have no official place to go for their pvp.
---
Second, no changes was in relation to the core mechanics of the game, i.e. no reworking gear stats, no changing spell lists for classes. In reality, vanilla wow had about 6 weeks between the introduction of the honor system and BGs being released.
---
The fact they went with a phase system instead of a patch system changed this, as it took 2 patches and lumped them together into a phase. Instead of the granular changes we got in vanilla, were getting larger content based phases.
---
The community is getting what they originally wanted. A short window of honor only gained from world pvp, then BGs for the hard core pvpers.
---
Blizzard wouldn't have done this on their own with the phase system, as releasing a new phase entirely would shift the pve meta as well as the pvp. The community is nudging blizzard away from the strict phase system to one that makes more sense.
---
In the end, blizzard is doing what the community wants, because it's the community that is paying for subs when there are literally free versions of this game that were available for years. Blizzard knows if they don't give the players a place to play the game that is actually playable for the massive majority, the community WILL find another place for it.
---
Am I correct in placing you on Bigglesworth?
---
Dont let the secret out!!
---
Drakestone of fire resistance has +14, and also is a insanely rare droprate for maximum ridiculousness (you see 25 drakestones of shadow wrath for every drakestone of fire resistance on average)
---
TukUi has options but they’re very limited. You get options like 3D portraits on/off etc. Data texts can be added but you have to play with ini files rather than in game.
---
Odds are Blizzard is hoping that BGs solve the problem.  Hopefully they aren't stupid enough to take it as a guarantee that it will, but who knows.  If they are smart they have other plans about how to handle the faction imbalance and are simply waiting to see what effect BGs have on the world.
---
The bigger issue is long term and has been a problem since vanilla.  That issue is faction pop in general.  If it is too low, regardless of faction balance, the server hits the "dead" range and is simply fucked.  For years I wished they would have just had forced mergers, but they never would.  I am not too hopeful they would do it for classic either.
---
What I think is likely to happen if BGs do not provide a significant change in the world is for Blizzard to bring sharding into classic and try to force faction balanced zones.  This might be far too late in some situations, but it is what I expect to eventually happen if BGs fail to solve the situation.
---
Literally all servers except one are vastly more horde.
---
I’m on one of the more balanced servers and it’s still around 70% horde.
---
Horde que times are going to be minimum of 15-20 minutes and ally will get instant que.
---
maybe the item was displayed differently on wowhead back then
---
Because people keep jumping ship.  Maybe if people stopped being cowards and could stand being inconvenienced for once in their sheltered lives then this sort of thing wouldn't happen.  But instead the run away hoping for greener pastures, IE: A server where they are the dominant faction and can do the very same things to the horde that were done to them that forced to leave in the first place.  Despicable.
---
I'm on Herod and I'm enjoying my time /shrug
---
Where is the source of this 60/40 claim?
---
This would also work with Zangief from the Street Fighter movie.
---
what if the orc has a thunderfury? Edgies would be sick
---
If there is anything specific you’d like, just let me know. I really need to make a macro guide. I keep meaning to do it but I’ve been too lazy lol.
---
Yeah I love trying to get somewhere and being dazed off my mount or being cut off my a mountain range
---
I think I read that everyone will get deserter debuff if they decline queue to prevents dodging.
---
If there's any consolation, Gordo got banned for goldbuying.
---
I was wondering the same thing after I crit his add for 4,270.  My highest crit before that was 3.3k or so.
---
How did private servers get the faction balance right?
---
Honestly tho, its not as alive as it was back in the day, Basically every merchant, doctor, dancer or whatever is just a Bot nowadays on Pservers. I know there were plenty of macro bots way back when, but the ratio of real players you actually meet nowadays is abyssmal compared to the real deal. Still fun tho! Just happy to be able to play the game without the lag i had back in 04' :D
---
Not as bad as Moortok tho :'(
---
Make sure you have addons like DBM up to date. They will help alert you of mechanics of the bosses.
---
Depending on your budget grab the following.
---
(greater) fire protection potions x1-2 for Rag
---
arcane protection potion x1  for Shazz
---
if you have low to no FR gear, grab 2 FR rings (fire resistance) ideally want around 100FR from gear alone for Rag fight.
---
Grab food buff that benefits your class
---
grab potions (health/mana) 
---
if you are a healer read up on your class for proper down ranked level for healing spells.
---
Nah he's an angry 40 year old and he's has such strong convictions because this is literally his only real "skill".  He can't do real life, just Classic WoW.
---
For the first few weeks of raiding we made a shared Google Sheet to do raid sign ups. 
---
1 Page was the confirmed raid roster where the officers / raid leaders would make the CONFIRMED group (Which was locked to just them) and then the 2nd page was for people to sign up with their role, class and any notes they needed to add. 
---
We mentioned in the beginning if people fucked with the order that others signed up it wouldn't be tolerated and we just wouldn't bring them or may even gkick them and it worked out fine. 
---
Posted a link to the sheet in discord where everyone could find.
---
I'm seeing a lot of similarity in the artstyle of WC3 Reforged and Heroes of the Storm. The last two retail expansions esp. BfA also demonstrates a similar convergence in artstyle with these two games. At least from a graphics standpoint, retail WoW is basically WoW 2 at this point.
---
Yeah me either
---
Can you link that?  I figure crit would overtake hit after reaching the special cap but it's nice to tie AP values to it since crit itself has a cap to it
---
Major mana potions will do the job.  You can also use Dark Runes instead of your lower rank mana gems, they share a CD but restore 900-1500 mana.
---
You can also write a macro to equip a high spirit weapon before you evocate, and you will get more mana back.
---
Yes, i don't understand 40 v 1,  or 10 v 1 while i am trying to fish, or our fucking boats being camped by a 40 man raid non stop. How about the 23 deaths it took me to get into BRD the other day? Do i not understand that either? How about the average 5+ deaths to get into a Dire Maul dungeon? Please explain these to me.
---
It's dead on my server, noone is leveling anymore hardly
---
Appears I confused redtuzkui for tukui, you keep all the options of elvui and gain some pre sets with that one. 
---
Elvui is great after you do some research on how to customize the features you dislike. I spent a couple of hours just looking at their forum so I could learn how to change a few things.
---
Me and my Brazil guild is alli on Fairbanks and it is great server! I disagree with this poster. I have lot of fun playing on Fairbanks. If anyone would like to check it out we have some big ally streamers on our side that always pvping. Check out twitch.tv/gggerms for example (no relation to him, he just fun guy to watch). 
---
Like other posters have said, we have pretty good balance. My guild sits with waste management behind a rock next to the valley by kargath. We like to jump on top of unsuspecting horde guilds going to brm lol
---
But I'm the tank...
---
Yeah, it's a pretty significant upgrade.
---
when it comes to consumables, you can get get 60-90% of the benefit of expensive consumables by paying 1/5th of the price.
---
i.e, mongoose = 5g, elixir of greater agility is 75s. 
---
mongoose is 25agility + 2crit, greater agility is 25 agility. 
---
when you're stacking buffs in good gear, that 2% makes a huge difference, but may not be worth ~10g (assuming no deaths, which is unlikely in a pug) + 5x however many times you die. 
---
in a pug i'd just go the budget way of consumes, get FPP rather than greater FPP for example. 
---
as you raid more though, make it a habit to atleast have all the consumes available, if you're in a guild doing their best, going from having no consumes to having enough to potentially last you a few should you not die should cost you 100-300g (assuming you get the good consumes, if you get cheap ones, it will cost you like 10-20g), it sucks to farm, but people will check and think a lot more of you if you put in the time and effort. 
---
google world buffs, try and get ony + rend buff, find your servers discord and there will likely be a channel finding out world buff timers. if you have a hunter friend, see if you can get a DM:N complete ID and get those buffs too. 
---
with a little bit of time free and an alt to play while you wait on buffs and a little gold, you'll basically be 130% of the player you'd be without them in terms of weight pulled. 
---
as it's your first time doing this sort of thing, i'd do it just for the practice and understanding of how to get prepared for a raid really.
---
How is it blizzard's responsibility? The players are the ones that created this problem.  Just because it's on blizzard's platform doesn't mean they should hand-hold and coddle the players to make sure everything is sunshine and rainbows.  That's what happened to retail and look where it's at right now.  Have some goddamned personal accountability instead of pushing all your problems onto someone else.
---
And now, there are no PvP servers on retail.
---
Blizzard has always kind of seemed to assume PvE is the default. Whether it has merit or not is your choice.
---
I miss Nostalrius alrdy that was the true vanila experience not this trash.
---
Thanks mate, I'll look into those
---
&gt; It’s a well known fact that there are more horde than alliance in the overall classic population
---
Got a source? I'd like to look at the numbers.
---
Don’t stick your head in the sand. Come make an alt on Stalagg and go to Ironforge. Do some /who tests. I think we all agree that there are no definitive population numbers available to us, but it is *clearly* a problem.
---
Umm, looks to be so yes lol.  I'm reserving P2 judgement when battlegrounds come out next week.
---
Also, Reddit is a hive for overall negative thinking for just about any topic.  So in think its fair to take anything you read on in this sub, past or present, with a grain of salt.    It would appear that even with all of the pvp shenanigans classic is still very entertaining to alot of people.
---
You can stack the different ranks of mana gems and use more than one during any fight, just use them as soon as you won't waste any mana by going over 100%, because I believe they all share a 90 second cooldown.
---
Yeah. Two guys one has 4p and the other has 6p. Two other guys right near by one of them has 4billion and the other has 6billlion. The guy with 6p and 6billion look across at each other as equals as they are both as equally rich compared to their companion. They bond over their equal wealth.
---
BRE is a pvp meme weapon on horde as well, OBE is still a better PvE weapon.
---
&gt;and no, you don't need to watch the videos. Just don't be a pleb who runs in front of the tank and accidentally pull mobs.
---
most of the bosses i would agree, but baron and majordomo would be well worth watching some vids on. one person fucking up can wipe you there pretty easily.
---
Fly, you fools! -Gandalf
---
Well at the same time. How can you blame them? Currently there is enough content outside of open world PvP for 3 hours per week. So obv. People will do open world PvP for the rest.
---
That's not true. I grinded to like 2100 RBG rating in BFA with pug premades using the lfg.
---
PvP gear and they don’t have faith the next server will be any better with the pvp griefing
---
If you're playing in EU that is to be expected, if you're playing NA I don't know what to say lol
---
I was able to participate in a podcast recently talking to the creative designer of SWG Raph Koster. Man he had som great stories about development of SWG. But yeah i agree, best mmo ever.
---
Wish me luck.
---
Horde now: wow, it looks like pvp happened on a pve server this time!
---
Dozens!
---
"You think you do, but you don't"
---
Wrong.
---
You cant transfer from EU servers to NA servers.
---
Really cool man
---
I leveled up my warrior from launch and did melee cleave all the way to 60 and it wasnt bad at all. It actually got really fun around Sm when you get Ravager and Whirlwind and shammies get windfury.
---
Yeah just saw the statistics, very balanced server it seems.
---
Just reading through this thread.  Curious if you got them all?
---
dwarves are the only part of the alliance that are remotely respectable, both from lore and the players. Never feel bad about making nelf or gnome players quit.
---
A lot of commenters don't realize why 60/40 is a stupidly massive advantage. Has to do with \[Lanchester's Law / Square Law\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s\_laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws)), which *very roughly* applies in disorganized pvp skirmishes.
---
The short version is that **very small** advantages in numbers can often result in the larger team winning with virtually everyone alive, while the smaller team all dies. This can be extremely counter-intuitive, because without thinking too hard, it seems reasonable that a small advantage should result in barely achieving victory, but that's often not the case. The law is just a mathematical model that explains why this happens. If you want to develop some intuition for why this happens \[this non-wow video\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpjxWBwLkIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpjxWBwLkIE)) is cool.
---
Don't forget the partnering with demons and old gods part.
---
Because guides and BIS aren’t always right.
---
eskhandar’s hand is amazing.
---
**Lanchester's laws**
---
Lanchester's laws are mathematical formulae for calculating the relative strengths of military forces.  The Lanchester equations are differential equations describing the time dependence of two armies' strengths A and B as a function of time, with the function depending only on A and B.In 1916, during World War I, Frederick Lanchester and M. Osipov independently devised a series of differential equations to demonstrate the power relationships between opposing forces. Among these are what is known as Lanchester's Linear Law (for ancient combat) and Lanchester's Square Law (for modern combat with long-range weapons such as firearms).
---
I got my PvP trinket after playing around in southshore for a while after honor released, and I’m good. Some of these sweaty majority faction players have been in IF ganking every time I’ve logged on for the past week lol
---
I would do anything to be on a 60/40 server
---
Love it! &lt;3
---
guild name checks out:  Leftovers
---
Nice, so you have to get 14 people to do all this fun in a 1v99 environment for one player to get gm?
---
What would have been just desserts is to not allow cross faction BGs for PvP servers
---
Almost all my friends quit like coward bitches when phase 2 hit and I'm more of a scrub casual than they are. Rank 2 with almost all chicom goldfarming bot kills and no dishonorable kills or "honorable" lowbie ganking, and proud of it.
---
I've got a lot of grilled squid and nightfin soup... 
---
2 and a half bank alts worth, with an all but dead guild to share it with.
---
But I am learning to tank and hit 60 just as phase 2 hit on my warrior. And I have now maxed out all my professions and made friends with the timbermaw tribe so I've got that going for me which is nice.
---
Because you're running around solo in state of wpvp. If I saw horde fishing I would kill him too idgaf I want the honor. Group up and go together. 
---
Also theres no way you corpse camped to dm last night. Alliancehero streams we literally controlled dm and the road to dm from 3pm pst to 1am pst when most people starting to go to bed. That's like our key spot in the entire realm and that's why I discredit what you say. If you bitched about brm I'd believe you but you're complaining about a zone we absolutely reck shit in. Our server is good. Dont give the false impression most of us dont enjoy it.

Horde players are pretty fuckin stupid so I believe it.

FYI this is intended as a joke, very close fight and a lot of mistakes were made.

Technically you can lean on default behavior of spells and simplify this macro to this:

    #showtooltip 
---
    /cast [mod:shift, @mouseover,help,nodead][mod:shift] Healing Wave(Rank 7); [@mouseover,help,nodead][] Healing Wave(Rank 10)

hope so.
---
General ruling in the past is as long as you're not advertising in the default global channels (Trade, General, LocalDefense) is that it's perfectly okay.
---
Why aren't you playing Planetside arena?
---
&gt; lol but they won't. leaving their safe zone is against the nature of those who participate in such fuckery.
---
People can't predict this before launch mate.
---
Alliance do the exact same thing when they can.
---
Correct, even if the %'s are the same in these scenarios, the relative power of 1 additional person is so much higher than the % shows if you only say 6:4 ratio.
---
These people are arguing as if this is a statistics class and ignoring the raw value of having extra health bars and spells being slung around.
---
&gt; SWTOR on the other hand is a great example of ugly ass cartoony graphics
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with you.
---
I think he meant the mount from the Raid, but could be wrong.
---
The AV one though? Yeah, couldn't be bothered to get another ram.
---
I had a friend take me along to do it. Ended up richer than my main in about two days, with a bunch of cat/rabbit pets in my bags and free Deadmines runs on demand.
---
I may someday make a poster from the Nobles perspective! :P
---
Thank you! :3
---
Man I finally got an alt to 60 and there’s no one to run dungeons with for pre-raid bis, very few MC pugs, and all the raid guilds are full. I’ve finally accepted raidlogging this past week since it’s just a waste of time trying to do anything else.
---
I unbinded movement keys from asd and made strafing q and e.
---
I then use asd from stance dancing and honestly the agility I can stance dance versus others is real.
---
It turned me from a warrior like everyone else into an actually good one who utilizes all of his stances at all times
---
&gt; diablo mmo in more realistic gritty graphics I would love!
---
So, Path of Exile ?
---
Maybe level 5? I would think 10 would make it too easy
---
You can [Society6](https://society6.com/imadreamwalker) :3

That trinket is amazing for tanking. +25 to all stats is no joke. If you're tanking 3+ mobs it's on pretty much all the time because the odds it reprocs during the 1min are really high.
---
We are forever plagued by the huntard meme. This is in spite of the fact that the games lead class designer, Kevin Jordan, has said hunters have one of the most complex rotation managments.
---
Sure, there are some people flaming them now, but one only needs to refer to Asmon and his followers to find numerous examples of very large numbers of people praising it. It was way less common for it to happen in Vanilla, and it was almost exclusively vilified.

That is funny, because i died 3 times to about 15 horde in there last night about 8pm trying to do a jump run. Not sure where you guys were. On the real, it does not help that i am a Prot Warrior and just basically have to take the death from anyone i come across, with the exception of Rogues.
---
Again its also depends on server activity, ally maybe less populated but more active on that server. I say everyone just says gz getting to 60, im horde on Mograine 50/50 and currently getting blasted the second i land in gadg. Dont get where this "Horde have it easy" comes from when only a few servers seem to truly represent that notion
---
What makes it so good compared to a weapon you can use with 305 WS? The extra 3% to miss and glancing blow penalty don’t seem worth the speed and higher base damage over BSH (Orc)
---
False. The comment I made is in direct relation to the comment 8 replied to saying that horde won’t get anymore honor cause all alliance left. Obviously false with bgs since they are cross realm and a source of honor. Not surprised alliance don’t read tHo.
---
For many phase 2 is a lot of fun. Typical of this subreddit to make baseless claims and put everyone in the same bucket , let me tell you,  not every server is experiencing a constant camp as you explain. You’re just the biggest fucking complainers on this subreddit cause you’re so disgruntled and it shows.
---
Last, bgs are still phase 2, not 3. Once again, not surprised by how misinformed this sub is.
---
Have fun complaining more though :)
---
While I sort of understand your point of view surely you must realize that its fucking boring to have to corpserun 15 times from thorium point to BRM only to have some priest MC you into lava or force you to go back towards TP making the corpseruns take even longer.
---
I dont mind pvp, i do mind griefing. There's a difference
---
Yeah I’m not sure what I’ll do with my alt when I get 60. I’ll probably just start Pugs and hope for the best. I figure a lot of my guild will have alts by then
---
Heartseeker is around 75/25 to 70/30. So not nearly as bad as Flamelash with it's 95/5 ratio.
---
yes mate, I wanted to die the moment I realized I forgot the harvest golems! They will be present in the Desktop wallpaper version for sure!

Fraudulent.

That’s really good to know! Makes my decision easier

one of my favourite things about classic is going to wowhead and reading the thottbott and alakazam comments they transferred over. It's a neat time capsule how people acted back then
---
Free-for-all PvP servers require self-moderation by the players. I think this worked back in the day because players as whole were a bit more considerate of others, including those of the opposing faction. Not as many were out to actively ruin the playtime of others. Griefing happened, sure, but it was rare enough that, even all these years later, the specific instances of it happening stand out in my memory. Now it is a non-stop thing the whole time you're logged in.
---
It's just a complete change in the mindset of the players. Vanilla WoW was not designed to accommodate the current mindset. I think if players then were like they are now, the original WoW devs would have done things differently. I mean, the non-PVP side of the game is practically unplayable; I don't think the devs then would have allowed that.
---
Classic is retail boyo
---
You need a large enough active pool of people on your server to reach the higher ranks. It's literally impossible to hit r14 if you only have 150 active people of your faction.
---
Thank you! That’s something I’ve been wondering about and wanted to use 2 hand but was worried about the group freaking out that I wasn’t sword and boarding it.
---
I use this trick to get people in the IF ravine so I can solo them real fast. Works wonders.
---
Why do people feel obligated to make this post in every. single. thread?
---
99% of people and everybody sane knows it's nothing intrinsic about horde causing this, why are you all so sensitive though that you feel the need to defend yourselves at every opening? It's a bit unnecessary and comes across needy.
---
I see, thanks

Are there any well balanced EU servers at all? Looking to move away from Firemaw, the lack of allies is boring.

Move your mouse to someone's frame + click your mouse button vs. move your mouse to someone's frame + press your keyboard button. Why would one be that much faster than the other?
---
Of course it won't work if you have typos in the macro, but that's why you first test them before going into a dungeon/raid/PvP group. That really shouldn't be an argument against using mouseover healing macros.
---
Alliance suck, simple as that. ZUG ZUG
---
What talent build are you using?  If you're specced deep enough into frost to have Ice Barrier, you'll be missing out on talents in the arcane tree that both increase your mana pool, and mana regeneration during combat.  If so, you might want to think about switching to a 31/0/20 arcane frost build as not only do you gain more mana for damage, it's also a higher DPS build.
---
Is it worth it to max out tailoring on my bank alt? Or should I just sell all of my clothm My bank alt is a priest, which I enjoy playing, but I want to focus on getting my druid main to 60. Will I be able to buy a mount at 40 if I'm not selling all this cloth?
---
Perfect example of how the honor system incentivizes shithead behavior and breaks wpvp.
---
People always reference alliance just "sitting in Ironforge" but what does this mean?  I really dont think it's indicative of anything significant.
---
I have both alliance and horde toons on different pvp servers, some which are balanced and some that definitely arent.  Orgrimmar is chock full of people all day and night as well.  I could say they are there because of server imbalance but that simply isnt true since it is present on each server I'm on.
---
I dont think many people log in just to sit in their faction's major city doing nothing appreciable.
---
&gt; I was really looking forward to WPVP, but there seems to be no skill or challenge involved              
---
&gt; Where is the challenge in this?        
---
             
---
If it was ever your impression that the fun of world pvp is the challenge, or was ever meant to be competitive or fair in any way, someone sold you a big fat lie.       
---
          
---
I say this as a person who very much prefers world pvp and would rather they wait until mid-January/whenever the BWL patch releases to release BGs. Their appeal is in bringing danger, hostility, and disparity to a leveling world that is otherwise incredibly static and predictable.     
---
         
---
For me, it's about not having little cordoned off, sanctioned and sterile pvp sporting events like CTF that are completely separated from and have no impact on the game world. When you're fighting in Hillsbrand, it's across the same hills, roads, in the same caves and camps that you leveled in before; where people are trying to level now. It makes the world feel whole and lived in.         
---
I can understand why you don't like it, having started in TBC where those concepts died. I will be grateful when BGs come out now, if only to ease the whining posts like these make about WPVP being 'disappointing' or 'not fun' or  whatever.
---
no i play around problems
---
DoTs are all over in pvp though... literally everywhere.   That really doesn't make it bad.  This is like a theory crafting "bad".
---
idk he seems pretty avg
---
&gt; They did it to themselves, now Blizzard allows them to go ruin another server.
---
It's the horde's fault they're in an unbalanced server?
---
That's exactly what the honor system promotes, you can't force people to play the other faction and certainly can't blame people for trying to get honor considering how the bracket system works. If anything it's Blizz's fault for the server caps, maybe
---
That's good news cuz I'm leveling an alt horde shaman on Benediction rn lul
---
I get it, you want it all without any effort. That's a quick and easy gkick.
---
You'll be on his spy list and at a 12 level disadvantage he can see through your stealth. So all they have to do is mount up in the direction your sprinted and spam click on your name in spy.

How do you know that the raid wide reset is a big?

This I never understood. It was never explained or anything. It's just.. "cataclysm".. But why there is a huge vortex.. I asked myself back then. There is no quest at all talking about it. But while it's a raging storm, you have a quest to just jump in and kill those slimes...

I always communicate with my party.

Sometimes the shaman responds and sometimes you get the silent treatment.

PLAYERS asked for these new servers.  Blizz had them on had, but the players begged for them because they couldn't be bothered to sit in a queue.  And so when blizz capitulated, and the players fucked it up, it's now blizzard's fault?

Last I checked, the saying "the customer is always right" means that the company will help the customer with anything they want, regardless of how stupid it may be; not that the company should be held responsible because the customer made a stupid request.

So after a few clears of LBRS (only getting one gem, ugh, HATE that shiz) I went...right into Scholo.  I might be weird but...I LOVE the place.  Even as a squishy rogue who's gear is solid if not spectacular, i just love it.  Sure it can be tricky (PS fck Jandice and the whore stink ghouls she rode in on) but getting to the end where its just non stop boss fights is awesome.  Alexi can be hard but Gandling is cake.  The neat instance only set, the variety and randomness of loot.  Love all of it.  Watching some reckless soul get punted into what I call a "bone hole" to get shredded by Rattlegore and co is hilarious as is seeing someone yeeted into the lake by Kirtonos.  Worth the wipe.  Looking forward to getting more into Strat, UBRS and DM this weekend!
---
Let's put it this way. All alliance players claim it is pretty balanced whilst all horde players claim they are outnumbered.
---
Same thing happened to me as a priest. Server was totally bloated with healers and my guild was way past me in progression. If I had a group of friends around the same place it could have been fun but basically I just felt shut out of the game and took it as a sign to move on.
---
There’s plenty of allies in Shazzrah, doesn’t seem like too much of an issue?
---
Well, at least someone is trying to save classic.
---
its a pvp server. what are you crying about?

Thanks! It was a pretty fun fight. Very lucky at the end.
---
also report this guy for using Nearby addon. That's completely cheating and bannable

You might want to replay that mission. The humans that were there were the racist remnants that planned to annihilate her and were most likely scarlet followers.
---
I feel bad for the guy trying to find group :(
---
There are addons that can auto /yell and put items in trade + accept at right price. Almost as a Vendor NPC.
---
i think its a really neat idea if "rp-botting" would be allowed or even supported ingame. 
---
Imagine you can logout and your character keeps doing things you programmed. May farm or trade or offer Quests for players who bring you material for a little gold. May patrol for pvp. 
---
Probebly would have many ways to abuse - but if it would be supported ingame and everybody can do it - thats balanced.
---
Depends on your comp.  For some it is super easy to trib (stealth, soothe, etc.)  For others it involves buying all the parts you need to use the trap, make the ogre suits, etc.
---
Fury wars can run slam spec to replace a large chunk of their auto attacks with slams that don't glance. They'll still need that 9% hit tho.

It's alright boiz... just wait for the server merges
---
It's like a 3gb download. Very fast.
---
The average player hears "join the horde" when they start because that's what everyone does. Also when you only have two teams as opposed from 3 teams it makes it more profitable for you as a player to join the largest team. If there were two smaller teams it creates a dynamic of two taking on one large...something taught in game design school but they literally taught me using this game as an example of how one side becomes overpopulated.
---
I would bet there are more than a few horde who would love to be allies but see it as futile or just want to play with their friends who are horde.
---
Yes.  I knew what was going to happen.  Everyone did.  And now that is has, suddenly everyone is surprised and upset?
---
Spare me.
---
Sounds like real life. Everyone would like to think their people are on  the right side.
---
Standing around in ironforge ?
---
Yeah, DBM is also useful! It's an addon, that you don't need to set up and it warns you about important boss abilities.
---
Serious question, what's the benefit of playing on a balanced pve server over a server that has a higher ratio for your faction?
---
What build are you suggesting? 25 arms for sword spec and then what
---
Taken from wiki:
---
The Mongols attacked Samarkand using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the Shah, held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.[41] Ata-Malik Juvayni, a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in Termez, on the Oxus, "all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain".
---
I'd say they were pretty barbaric by modern standards too
---
Chats have been wrong for a while. All you have to do is play to see there’s a major issue.

In my experience, people treat you differently once they find out you're a girl. It's easier to let people believe you're a dude.

yes mr agenda pusher nothing in classic requires skill and theres no competiton whatsoever between the top premades just put in more hours!!!! XD fuck me man

So what’s the story with this server? Have the alliance completely abandoned?

---
I would definitely recommend giving it a shot. Playing short stop isn't for everyone but if you like variety and dont mind using a wardrobe addon it can be fun alternating between tanking and healing
---
Maxing out a profession requires level 35. If you're committed to leveling your bank alt to 35, then sure, you can do that. Most money while leveling comes from quests and selling greens, anyway.
---
They certainly make the pve server fun like a pvp. I’m hoping we get a slight population increase and it’ll really be popping off for a pve server
---
Yeah I made characters on a RPPVP server (deviate delight) and I’m more of a casual player but I stopped playing for a bit because I couldn’t get through STV without constantly being killed by horde. Idk if there are a lot of transfers, but I log in 3 weeks later and go to redridge and its practically empty so I just stopped playing altogether

It was really fun up until phase 2.  I do enjoy open-world PvP but the min-maxing mentality has really taken any and all fun out of the game for me.  I'm at least lucky enough that I made it to level 60 before P2 hit.  I legitimately spent three hours being camped at light's hope chapel last night by a raid of 20+.  the same guild just sits on FP and GY.  had to logon at 5 am just to hearth home before work.   Currently just logon for raid nights and waiting for BGs to come out.  I would have rolled on a PvE server if I would have realized it'd be this bad.  Honestly, I don't see myself playing the game in 2020.  I just definitely do not have the time or energy to re-roll a whole new character and actually get them regeared.

---
Tbh I don't think that complaining about griefing on Reddit is ok. The only exception is couple servers where balance is non-existent, like 80/20. People really struggling there. But in average server it's not that bad.  I got camped by allianceb couple times, but I always have potions of invisibility(they are cheap) to just run away, mount up and leave. I think it's part of pvp and will not going to complain about it. Complaining is a weak move. Stay strong.

---
You seem to be missing quite a bit of post up there, though I suppose that's not surprising. 
---
I'll sum it up the relevant bits for ya.
---
It's the no-life player base that focused so extremely on hyper efficiency that they now have nothing left to do in the game but farm lowbies like mobs on launch day that are the assholes. They. Over. Did. It. To the point where if you didn't do likewise you can now no longer play the game.
---
Back to your streamer sever kid
---
It's for sure wildly inaccurate. Better to not use it at all. If trust ironforge.pro more. Raid logs will give you a better idea
---
I mean yeah after people had figured it out. Thotbot didn't have the answers before that though.
---
Yes. I remember standing at the cliffs near lumbermill in AB and being able to see far enough that I was able to make call outs about enemy movements.
---
It helps. Especially for aoe pulls.
---
For the first paragraph, you can be the master crafter of a guild in ESO and basically just spend all your playing time turning mats into armor and weapons, enchanting, transmuting, making sets etc.
---
I was away on the 5th of December when the whole thing happened. I was unaware of it all. Now I am trapped on Flamelash alone. Got a level 60 paladin and a level 52 Warrior. The server is dead. The 5th of December is the day my life fell apart.
---
tbh it only got bad from 48 - 52 where I'm currently stalled out.  Tuesdays are good bc the jerks are all in fresh raids. but otherwise its alliance camping the bulwark roving death squads in Ungoro, WPL, EPL, Felwood, and Winterspring.   Ive done ST and Mara to death. just trying to get to 53 so i can just do BRD and LBRS till upper 50s and i stand more of a chance against the death squads.
---
I think the moral is that you should treat other players properly or risk killing off the fun for everyone
---
I wasn't crying about it, I was calling you out for saying flying ruined the game. Don't be such a cunt
---
Again, you're missing the point.  Blizzard created a system where to reach a goal you'd absolutely have to no-life it, which is ironic given the other comment. 
---
i.e.
---
"We made a system to reward this behavior, but you should not do this as it is unhealthy."
---
The non-hypocritical way to handle this would be to, for example, have something like r10 be the maximum rank, with the same % of server pop gate as today.  Or another option would be that you do not decay, and can hit R14 just in a longer total amount of time (everyone would eventually hit r14).  It would be far less exclusive to hit a rank in this system, sure, but it would greatly reduce the incentive to no-life the game.
---
Which I'm sure will be so cool to walk around with and have people admire... Oh wait.
---
Makes sense. As a priest I havnt found a need for a macro yet. Everything is a mouse click away. Though I prefer the look of Luna unit frames when I doneloaded it, all I got was an absolute mess on my screen and I could not find the one click spell in the menu. Lol but I don't take the time to learn all this stuff. 
---
 My dear is when I start my alt I'll have to find macros to use and then figure out how they even work.
---
It's pretty huge for AoE since it benefits from defensive stance threat multipliers, and stacks quite nicely with other aoe (return) damage, especially if improved by 75%. For single target it's nice, but not significant (maybe 1-2% additional threat, depending on content/gear level)
---
I went full tank. You might get asked to do the same so your MT group can have the Crit buff. Ideally to maximize your usage the 0/30/21 would be best for that. If you just plan on tanking and DPS do 11/35/5. 11 for OoC, 5 in resto, some reccomend 7 but I used those 2 points in the feral tree for cat DPS talents. With preraid bis you have decent armour and hp, once you start getting some P2 bis gear you get way more tanky. We only need like 4 things from mc so it's noticeable.
---
Insane that a gnomer can still be viable in MC
---
Yes but thinking about it for 10 seconds makes it painful obvious that no, you can't ask as a level 1 auto attacks you and reach 1000000 in all stats
---
Good kills bigglesworth represent!
---
I wish Blizzard could figure out single shard servers like Eve.  Lol
---
I don’t think Herod is very even tbh. It’s definitely not as bad as people make it seem but it’s definitely pretty heavily skewed in the horde’s favor. What time of day are you playing? I think the only time I’ve seen DM alliance controlled is the one time me and some buddies formed a raid and took it ourselves, other than that it’s death walking 8+ times to get into the instance. BRM goes both ways because the best pvp guild on alliance loves to camp there.
---
Man I must have bad timing because I get killed on the way in the the various dungeons almost every time I run one.
---
Flurry Axe is offhand BiS, even with Deathbringer.
---
You can tab-target attackable mobs, except critters. Players of the opposite faction are unattackable if either is unflagged, so they can't be tab-targeted. Same happens with NPCs of factions you can gain rep with—go into some neutral town you're neutral with, try and tab-target the guards. Then declare war on them and try again.
---
Ret Paladins using Seal of Command: seems like I read something on here that the Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnoros proc can trigger off of a Seal of Command proc.
---
Is this the case?  And if this is the case, does this make a strong case for Ret Paladins swinging Seal of Command to highly prioritize 2h's with procs, because we will benefit more from the proc than other classes, seeing as how we essentially get 6.8 bonus attacks per minute that can trigger the weapon proc?  Because typical proc weapons come without stats.  And if the stats are weighted evenly to the proc assuming some basic toon like a warrior is just going to stand there auto-attacking, then the proc would be worth more than any bonus str/agi for dps.  Please advise.
---
its really tough to tell it depends on how many pvpers of each facion there is in total.
---
Say this: There's 9k ally and 10k horde. In that case there will be 1k horde in queue total, say an average game of AV takes 20 mins, you have to wait 1/9 \* 20 mins = 2.22 mins to join AV, that's for a 45-55 ratio, and 20 mins is honestly quite modest, it will likely be lower. So you need quite severe faction imbalance in order to actually get queues when you have this many players in the pool
---
Whatever, there was none before p2 rolled in and the shitshow started regardless.
---
I can smell you through the screen.
---
I camped this level 48 for 40 minutes and now they have the audacity to say pvp is bad!? Why!???
---
LOL that is amazing

you must be new to game.
---
On the plus side, really easy to get ranks when BGs release.
---
Is there really a faction balance problem when considering all realms? Why do more people prefer horde?
---
I replied to this in an other comment
---
This makes me so depressed as an Alliance player. Why is Blizzard so silent on the entire topic? Just saying, "they don't care" or "no changes" doesn't make sense. There is a markable drop in the player base. Why don't they just release a statement like we hear you and we are waiting to figure it out
---
nah he's on my server.
---
About 3800 horde online to alliance 2200 during the most active hours
---
I mean they implemented it the way the nochanges crowd wanted.
---
I was a hunter main in my guild before I decided to invest my profits from dire maul farming in a warrior. Now im pre raid BiS on him and loving it and want to main warrior. Running deep woods/flurry on an orc and always compete for top overall damage.
---
However, im the lowest warrior on the totem pole for weapons. In terms of ease of acquiring them, I could get basically the next OEB that drops, or 2-3 drops to get DB, Spinal, or BRE. If all I care about is overall boss damage over a full MC, which weapon would you go for?
---
He's acknowledging the contradictory and imperfect nature of his views, although he knows what the "correct" feeling is.  This is actually quite interesting because it's how the world turns.  People who are aware of this duality have a level of awareness that is really good for whatever community they are a part of.  They can state understanding for the other side of an argument and recognize where they lie on the spectrum.
---
But I understand you just want people to shout for the alliance or for the horde so you can decide who the good and bad guys are.
---
That's actually probably pretty damn good in pvp if the druid gears for it properly
---
That’s where it’s at !
---
I came to grobbulus. Made a little mage named kuullion. If you come you'll have another lowby friend.
---
I intend to tank my first dungeon tonight, RFC. a couple questions: 1. Whats the general rule on when to go ahead with pulling while mana folks are drinking? Is the healer the only one I should worry about, the dps mana folks will join in when they are ready? 2. Should I bother with a threat meter add on at this point or can that wait until later in my “career”?
---
They are boring to level, miserable to play solo at max level,  and their healing rotation is the most simple of all healers in PVE.  They are OP healers,  but the overall experience of playing pally is a boring one.
---
Sounds exactly like me and my friends. Gone for 5 days and boom, suddenly the whole server panicked and left.
---
It doesn't seem very good in classic. It is at the bottom of the level bracket almost and doesn't have an OP enough ability to make up for it.
---
Way later on in expansions, I think WoD, the effect is buffed and changed with stat changes over the years to make it BiS, it might have been an even later expansion where the item could drop as a level 29 item.
---
How Can you assume census data was wrong ? The game was even modified by blizzard to stop it so I guess the results were not that flawed ?
---
how would gear make meme specs more viable?  It would have to be so ridiculously overtuned it would absolutely break pvp/the rest of the game.  You need a talent/fundamental overhaul to make meme specs viable.
---
Flying DID ruin the game though. People can have different opinions. Don't be such a cunt.
---
Yah all the consumes you need in bear form, e.g.
---
cancel form + heal pot + wipper root tuber + dire bear form
---
cancel form + Health stone t + wipper root tuber + dire bear form
---
Then another version each for Free Action, Restorative, Greater Fire  Protection, Greater Arane protection. Stone skin (2k armor), if your using those during raids.
---
Then the cancel Aura + power shift macro's for Bear and Cat. So you don't lose Leader of the pack every other cycle.
---
Cat + stealth.
---
Cat + dash.
---
Bear + Charge
---
all the Heals and nukes need  dismount + stand + cancel form, then mouseover target cascasde.
---
Then recovery macro that eat + Drink + shadow meld.
---
Then innervate needs a special macro to whisper it's target to let them know they have been innervated.
---
Rebirth needs a special macro to announce to raid that rebirth incoming on X.
---
Cyclone needs a special macro to cast at mouse location, instead of waiting for targeting cursor.
---
Then macro to use a crowd pummler charge that doesn't get confused and try to equip a different pummler instead.
---
shrug. I've never heard of a paladin who heals in raids taking the time to forge it. It's always warriors or mainspec ret paladins.
---
Yeah it's not super necessary, just preference :)
---
Brah, what is that UI man :D its not 2014
---
Oh stop whining. I've been leveling my alt on Faerlina and the same shit happens but I've gone 40-46 on my pally since thanksgiving and still got bracket 5 PVP on my main. 
---
Gadget being camped hardly matters, you die twice and then you are outside the city where horde wont bother following a grey lowbie. All of the honor is in gadget so if you get like 100 yards away, you're fine.
---
As for flight masters, know where you are going and fly from a capital city. It doesn't matter if your destination's flight master is dead. But if you fuck up and click Menethil or Southshore when you really wanted to go to Aerie Peak (FP is never dead there btw), that's your fault.
---
Boat being camped is a non-issue. If you get killed while waiting for the boat, run back, stay in ghost form until the boat arrives, rez, hop on. If you get immediately killed after getting on the boat, just sit and wait (like you normally fucking would on a boat ride) and you will rez automatically. You will likely be immediately killed again, at which point you spirit run back to the docks, rez 40 yards away from the boat on the docks and run into town. I do this 90% of the time going from Menethil to Theramore and it has never caused me to miss a boat. Literally the only times it has cost me time is if there is a rogue deep on the Theramore docks that kills me again after my last rez off the boat.
---
For who exactly? I’ve never heard of WSG having a time limit.
---
shit man im level 60 and taking a few weeks break of any serious playing.  I get on for raid once a week and log.  That's it.  I tried to help a friend last night do something, and got camped at lights hope chapel for over 3 hours.  FP and GY both camped, and flight master dead.  SO FUN.  I was only worth honor for the first 15 minutes lol
---
Hi. I'm your raid leader. Thank you for asking me this question ahead of time.
---
You will be expected to bring 39 flasks, each wrapped in red wrapping paper, to be handed out to the other raid members.
---
Oh, and don't forget your fishing pole.
---
See you later tonight!
---
You forgot that I only get to play like once a week
---
Don't worry, server merge will fix that.
---
Would love to share my rhok delar story here. Had a 29 dps crossbow, 4 beatsstalker and 1 giantstalker item:
---
At first I read that you can do the hunter quest for other people so I grouped with another hunter so that we both get the loot. After a lot of tries I managed to kill him with a greater mana pot but only the other hunter could loot. 
---
The  next day I managed to kill him second try. 
---
Then I fought the one in burning steppes mainly with wing clip and scorpid stings and auto shots after 2 tries. Needed a greater mana pot. He enrages every 15 seconds.
---
After a couple of pulls I trapped Simone and killed her pet and then her easily with a mana pot as well by using cheetah 100% of the time. Both of them never hit me. I mainly autoshot and consussiveshotted simone and outranged her spells. 
---
Because of my gear I tried solemnor only with a wl. Interestingly after two tries I killed him with a small and a big shadow protection pot and a bandage but somehow he was again tagged by the hunter/wl group which helped me. No idea how that happened. 
---
The try after that I downed him again, but it was pretty close, because I could not use mana pots because of my health with 1 healpot and 1 healthstone. Greater shadow Protection pots were 5g, which was too much to buy more than one. 
---
Amazing questline, thought simone would be harder.
---
I danced naked with my night elf on the IF mailbox and got two tips about a month ago.
---
Spinal and either slam on single target or swap to deep woods/flurry.
---
Yeah it didn't though. A bad community and increased rng ruined the game, and most of that didn't happen until WOD
---
It can be dicey if you have any pet classes and someone wants to grab the first deed for the quest. Those mobs fear and I discovered that a felhunter can be feared one run. It pulled every last mob in that room. You have to have spacial awareness.  Butt pulling patrols is pretty common in the nightmare PUGs I've had recently.
---
that's consistent with RP server experience as well.
---
1
---
That too. Though I think paladins might legitimately want HoR over BRE, as way more of their damage is nonphysical.
---
A majority ? You have any kind of list of all of them?
---
&gt; But it's still the same relative advantage 
---
So many people, like you, fail drastically at math. No wonder the world is shit.
---
The higher the population, the bigger the advantage of the dominating faction. This is so blatantly logical and common sense, not to mention mathematically PROVEN, it is amazing that a lot of people still don't get it.
---
A 60-40 ratio back in Vanilla was considered balanced, because most servers had 2k concurrent players, which translates into 1,200 players vs 800 players. Even if all would have a face-off, if the 800 are just slightly more organized, or slightly more geared or skilled, they might actually win, or at least pull a draw.
---
Now, a 60-40 in Classic, with 10k players....well, it's 6,000 vs 4,000. It pretty much doesn't matter how organized the 4,000 are, the 6,000 would most likely win by sheer numbers. And if the 6,000 are even a little bit organized, they will win all the time, because the 4,000 can be much better geared and much better organized...they cannot win.
---
This is why there is no relative advantage, when we talk about numbers. The same ratio becomes unbearable with the increase in numbers.
---
It's math. Simple math.
---
That you, and a ton of people fail at.
---
And this is why you probably think Blizzard cannot be at fault for creating huge servers, right?
---
You can't use it on a lot of fights due to the fireball proc.
---
It take a debuff spot
---
Uh...but dont you only use the gnomer weapon when the cooldown is up and just swap to your normal weapon after using it?
---
Trying to queue and cancel HS is just not worth it unless you're going for top parses ever.
---
However, HS is a great rage dump and if you have it queued up to use your offhand will hit more often. So it's a great idea to use it as often as possible when you have more than enough rage to cast your BT and WW.
---
Legitimate questions, what makes a *Good* holy paladin OP in your eyes? What can be done better that they are not or specific behaviors vastly improve there capabilities?
---
It’s really, really bad. 
---
I play PvP mostly solo, so the view distance is incredibly important to me. It’s the difference between me initiating on someone I think is alone vs choosing to run away. 
---
I don’t get upset when I get killed by a party. That’s world PvP. I get bummed when there’s no way play around it.
---
The root cause is the faction imbalance, something that could have been alleviated by restricting transfers by faction. Personally I would blame the #nochanges crowd myself. They pushed for the exact situation we find ourselves in now.
---
&gt;Whatever, there was none before p2 rolled in and the shitshow started regardless.
---
People were discussing the horde imbalance before phase 2 as well. I made a post about faction ques and imbalance 2 months ago. You are going to have a hard time convincing people that there are a majority of alliance in servers with out any concrete evidence from Blizzards side. Especially when the only horde complaining about faction imbalance are from heartseeker.
---
Weapon damage is irrelevant for feral
---
I would assume it is faster, since you're not downloading 10 years worth of expansions as well. And no, you don't need to download the retail game as well. Beyond the launcher, they are totally separate games/programs.
---
I didn't think you could see opposing faction ghosts when a ghost ... Or do you mean they have an alliance alt to follow you? Also Herod is 45-55 that is barely a difference and is pretty much the best you can ask for. TP is farmed by horde because that's where alliance lands horde go to kargath and there's always 30+ ally at kargath and the ravine heading into searing gorge it is the same deal
---
Slam doesn't replace autos, it resets them.
---
A slam rotation functionally adds 1s to the weapon's swing time and roughly doubles its damage output before the rest of the rotation.
---
&gt; You realize that even among premades there are many tiers of skill
---
And the lowest tier will get tired of constantly losing, so they quit. Followed by the next lowest tier. Until all that's left is the extremely good premades who just win trade against each other.
---
Honestly my server isnt bad it's a 55/45 Horde Ali balance and the wPvP isn't bad at all in most zones.   But I do have friends on other servers where it's all I hear about make this for them :)
---
We'll train in the forests, killing boars.
---
God please no. Sharding is awful. I'd much prefer faction specific que's but that seems way too heavy handed for Blizzard. Likely they'll just do paid transfers and sit back and do nothing.
---
Are you horde or alliance? If you are horde, alliance has an edge on you and wsg is probably your better option
---
It will push off dots which will upset your warlocks you let use corruption. Also the dps is very hot garbage compared to 2 handed fury - like about half probably. If you do it, you’ll be getting carried which if you can get away with, is fine lol
---
I’ve personally been going with Runn Tum Tuber Surprise (+int food) and Major Mana Potions as a healing priest.
---
Anecdotally, I recently started using Eskhandar's and it's made my tanking life a lot easier.
---
The main factors I think are:
---
- A smooth rage gain is much preferable to a spiky one, I much prefer the steady rage income.
---
- On a lot of content, and especially in raids, you'll have a ton of rage do dump, and sometimes you'll get smacked with a huge amount of damage and rage gain. It's in your best interest to have the ability to dump that rage pool as fast as possible with heroic strikes.
---
- Don't discount the attack speed proc. When it goes off and you start hitting like a maniac, it translates to quite a bit more rage.
---
Not even close to 200g, especially on horde where you can get the WC staff. More like 30g
---
Because this would mean that even on a 50-50 server, if you have a much higher concentration of pvper horde sided then you could feel that the server is imbalanced while it's actually a 50-50 simply because much more of them are farming honor
---
I looked it up, it is actually patch 1.12.1. So, it should be phase 6 :/
---
There's a little more to it than arms vs fury... With a PvP spec, you'll have very different talents than in an arms dps spec. Improved hamstring and piercing howl are important PvP talents that are almost entirely useless in PvE. Meanwhile fury is significantly better dps than arms dps for Bosses in raids, and around the same for mobs. If your guild is smashing MC without deaths then they might be cool with you playing the PvP arms spec but it's really terrible in comparison to fury.
---
90% UD, 5-5% Orc/Troll
---
Stalagg already got one exodus back in the beginning. Lots of us left for Heartseeker because of both the queues and unbalance. Now that honor is out, it's got to be incredibly hard to get anything done, probably even in cities.
---
What enchants do you recommend?
---
Horde are using alliance alts on separate accounts.
---
Hard to say without knowing your class. But assuming you aren't tanking.
---
Have deadly boss mobs and a threat meter. These should be mandatory for everyone.
---
 If your class can decurse or cleans get something like decursive to make your life easier. A lot of MC bosses are curse and cleanse fests. 
---
Soma Mana or health pots. Have a stack of bandages
---
Food buffs  and some other cheap buffs. I wouldnt  worry about flasks. Not needed for MC. 
---
Watch some videos or read some guides so you are familiar with the boss Mechanics. MC bosses aren't mechanically difficult but it helps to be prepared.
---
Bring one or two fire resist pots if they plan on doing a full clear. Shouldn't need them until ragnaros.
---
There isn't a level cutoff, but low level characters only get a fraction of the honor that a high level character would:
---
So you could get a lowbie R14 on an empty server, but it would be effectively impossible on a server with even a low population.
---
It's fine and completely legal. Leave it up to others to regret their decisions or celebrate their luck later.
---
I was in the same boat.  My advice would be to do them in the morning.  I ended up doing 3/4 of them at 6pac, 7mount, 8central, 9east, playing on a Pacific Time Server.  I used the same strategy on every boss, the strategy for the Winterspring Demon.  
---
Silithus Demon Cheese:  Have a warlock curse you for the cheese, have them reapply the curse if it is about to run out.  The important part with this fight is constant damage.  You just shoot, step, shoot, step, shoot step left/right(whichever is more comfortable) around him in a circle, use major abilities on cd and go back to circling with auto-shots trying to do constant damage.  Rank 1 wingclip when he gets close and go back to damaging. 
---
The other 3 demons I did the exact same strategy.  I killed the Winterspring demon first.  Staying at range, keeping serpent sting up, using rank 1 arcane shot to keep it in combat and concussive shot to keep range.  Kite it along the road and just keep going.  I ended up a ways down the fork that heads away from Everlook before I killed it. 
---
With the Ungoro Demon I used the exact same strat.  Place a freezing trap when you want to start.  I opened on her pet with Aimed Shot then hit it instantly with a concussive shot to slow it down, the demon will run into your trap and be frozen.  Kite the dog and hit it with rank one wing clips when it gets close to you.  Eventually your trap will fade and the demon will give chase and catch back up with you.  You can essentially ignore her and just make sure you keep moving and kiting / killing her pet.  Every so often she will stop to cast a spell on you.  If you keep running you will just outrange her cast, it will fail, then she will just start running after you again.  Once her pet is down, you just keep running and outrange her cast, hit her with whatever you can after she starts running after you again.  I didn't even bother using viper sting.  Keep serpent sting up on her, stay at your max range and just keep outranging her casts until she goes down. 
---
With the Burning Steppes demon its the same thing.  I tried to do it with the intended mechanics but it was a mess.  There is a video on youtube that uses the kiting strategy.  You just start the encounter with the demon as far east near the road as you can, then kite his ass all the way west.  I had to turn around when I got to the western part of the map so I just made a wide circle turn and started heading back the other way.  Keep serpent sting up, use concussive to keep him at range, use scatter if he gets scary close and just kite, auto and hit him with whatever you can while you're kiting.  
---
Consumables:
---
Mana Pots, Heavy Runecloth Bandages, Demonic Runes.  If you're going to just kite them this is all you really need for the 3 encounters you will be kiting.  
---
For the 4th demon in Silithus, I would just get whatever you can to make the fight as short as possible.  
---
Elixir of Demonslaying, Full buffs, Elixir of the mongoose, Squid Food for +10 Agi,  mana pots, bandages, and demonic runes and just go ham. 
---
I did it this way with blues and a tier 2 helm.  I figure they expect you to at least have a few pieces of tier 1 before you get your leaf making the normal mechanics more doable but I found that just kiting everything was a lot easier and less stressful.  I also had more problems with people of my own faction "trying to help" me when they see me fighting a big ole demon in the middle of nowhere, which is normally great, but not so much with these demons, so you might want to do a /yell "I am starting the demon encounter for my hunter epic bow quest, please do not assist me in any way as it will despawn the encounter and spawn a sweeper that will likely 1 shot you."
---
Good Luck!
---
Actually I've heard that you need a minimum amount of people participating to reach the higher ranks so they probably don't have enough players to get to rank 14. Game is literally unplayable for them now.
---
According to our guild logs, our top fury warrior (in mostly blue BIS with dalrends, a few bis epics) dropped in dmg by like 40% when he switched to arms after getting Bonereaver's edge. Also there is concern that mortal strike is overriding an existing DPS dot with the useless heal reduction debuff. 
---
I heal though so that's all i really know.
---
Well duh, we are obviously talking about numbers and not what is the percentage of the population.
---
Is anyone else tempted to roll a new Ally character on this server?  I kind of am tempted to give it a go.  It would be like being in the Resistance during the war.
---
Yeah I tried questing in Badlands too as an Alliance and with no FP or inn it's not exactly Alliance friendly so I think I'm going to move to swamp of sorrows or I might even go to Kalimdor.
---
As of right now the addon say at level 60 the alliance are at 70% and horde are at 30%. Something has to be done. I hate being on this server
---
I believe wsg is better honor if you can win 5-10m games in a premade
---
You get more HKs in world pvp.
---
I did indeed not read puģ, assumed guild
---
Oh man they do not make exceptions. I transferred off my realm cuz it was overpopulated, none of my friends followed. I spent hours and hours and hours talking on the phone with blizzard. Begging. I would call at least 3 times a day every day for a week.
---
So Allies get DM and a random farming zone, while horde have the zone that contains UBRS, LBRS, BRD, MC, and BWL, along with the zones surrounding it. Sounds like a server with a balanced population :p
---
I get you man, I get you. I'm alliance and I don't belive in faction imbalance on ALL SERVERS
---
Except that's what it was exactly in literally every mmo that existed at the time. In fact wow was absolutely casual and noob friendly in comparison, which is probably why it was such financial success. But even that wasn't enough for some, as they wanted to just log in for 30 min a day and get an epic anyway. Catering to that crowd is why wow sucks now, imo. Because if nothing else, you can just do dailies in a couple minutes and get a reward for it, even an upgrade.
---
Make sure to tell your group you need 5 for the quest. If they're being bitchy you can offer to only loot the holy water and leave the consumables for them (dont trust them to loot and leave the water, most auto loot the whole crate). 
---
The end of Strat UD has a high number of un-trapped crates. You can usually find 1-2 by where Magister is killed, and then another few safe ones, plus special holy water crates (have a red + on it and only contains holy water) in the Abomination courtyard.
---
I didn't think there was a level requirement, and honestly the suggestion was intended largely to be tongue in cheek but it's nice to have confirmation that it is (theoretically and hilariously) possible.
---
Its hard in vanilla because of the Paladin/shaman debacle. But obviously, something need to be done.
---
That is a bad comparison then and probably the reason you were downvoted.
---
Okay.  Took a break for a bit and calmed down.  First let me apologize, since I used some harsh language and got a bit heated.  It's just that these people have no idea what they are doing.  They are trading the longevity of the entire server for short term personal gains, not realizing that they are actively making the problem worse.  And that just ticks me off to no end.
---
I just wish people would actually THINK things through for once...
---
"Lets form a raid and camp end-game instances, as well as the whole zone."
---
Blizzard didn't do that.
---
In EvE, when I played, content was the goal.  And what that when territory wasn't being taken, it meant groups of people would reship to larger/smaller/countering doctrines to make the battlefield more fair.  Sure, there were outliers who decided to go ham, but for the most part people understood that the other group had the capacity to just walk the fuck away.
---
This was player driven self correction.  CCP didn't enforce it.
---
And now that the pendulum swings in an entirely predictable direction; suddenly being a proponent of physics doing what physics does warrants it all being placed at Blizzard's feet.
---
Like the fat person loudly blaming someone else while sitting at the buffet line waiting for more food to come out...  All the people complaining about no content utterly gorged themselves with no self restraint, no concept of the ramifications, and no care in the world.  
---
Now y'all got the Diabeetus, with Battlegrounds perhaps the insulin pump you'll need to keep your subscription going.
---
&gt;Because this would mean that even on a 50-50 server, if you have a much higher concentration of pvper horde sided then you could feel that the server is imbalanced while it's actually a 50-50 simply because much more of them are farming honor
---
That's assuming that you don't have decrease in alliance players due to horde being the attractive pvp faction. You would have to provide some type of evidence that the alliance has some sort of incentive to roll to make up the difference. You are skipping a logical step to jump to the conclusion you want.
---
Blizzard needs to just let them transfer off. You can't even play that game at that point.
---
yuuuuup. 1 shots the basic undead mobs. Works really well on the undead that attack you in Live UD, the undead that swarm you after Ramstein, and the skeletons in Baron's room.
---
well assuming they don't down rag in one go, you might need a pair or 2 extra, you pop 2 per fight so... yeah?
---
Depends on queue times.
---
If queues are long, it's best to squeeze as much honor as you can out of the games.

AV Zerg rushes suck, and they ruin the match for everyone. Just plan on AV matches taking 45 minutes to an hour on average, and don’t try to rush it. You’ll still earn an assload of honor and HK’s and will actually have *fun* doing it. Instead of it being a boring grind.
---
Two greater fire protection pots for Ragnaros fight. That's literally all you need + mana pots if you're a caster or HP pots if you're not.
---
HOtW/NS...nuff said. 
---
This way you can do everything with good quality except dps...which you never will regardless of spec.
---
you are definitely part of the problem u whiny little baby &lt;3
---
It's not that bad. I'd say most important is to run dungeons every few levels to keep your gear up to date, which isn't hard since everybody's always looking for tanks.
---
Also make sure you recruit some friends to help you get the Whirlwind Axe immediately at 30. Makes the 30s and early 40s a breeze.
---
Seeing spirits is not intended, actions taken to see spirits is against the TOS.
---
Nice.
---
And now it's going to take them even longer. There are so few alliance that even farming for Honor, you can't know if you'll be high or low on the honor charts.
---
Many pservers had to cap horde from creating characters. I don't remember the same for alliance.
---
The number of people parroting this hilarious opinion is shocking. Imagine being this vindictive towards online strangers over a game.
---
Yea that’s kind of one of the benefits to being a healer - not many consumes. Aside from a few fire protection and restorative pots, you really only need major mana pots and demonic/dark runes.
---
&gt; The 5th of December is the day my life fell apart.
---
A bit dramatic, don't you think?
---
Never thought of that. Lol. Left my 60 on what I imagine is now a dead server. Might try this. LUL.
---
&gt;BG Queue Complaint
---
What kind of complaints are we expecting?
---
The main reason is mortal strike taking a rebuff slot. Which makes it not so great in guilds who worry about that. 
---
There is also your suboptimal rage generation compared to fury. Horde has it better with windfury and orc axe racial. 
---
In current fights like sulfuron and doom it’s okay to bring one and have one.
---
Yeah but when I open the macro menu I have tried this copy and paste thing and I don't know where to go from there. I have no idea where it goes once I create it let alone use it effectively lol. 
---
 I played the game without any add-ons for the longest time then realized questie and atlas loot is quite useful. It wasn't untill sunken Temple I was told about healer add ons since I didn't know they were a thing lol, so I downloaded Heal bot and I got it working in 5 minutes, where I think I spend over an hour trying to get one macro to work and was not successful lol
---
You get 1 token i believe.
---
Played a Rogue in Vanilla and now a Mage in Classic. 40+ alt for both
---
Raiding: Much easier. MC pugs were not a thing for a longgg time. Certainly not puggable 1 month after release. Part of it is changes to the average gamer and the accessibility of strategies and gearing. Part of it is that the content is just straight easier. This is a late Classic patch and that matters. 
---
Gearing: Wayyyy different. My Rogue with t1/t2 and predictions blade DOMINATED for almost all of classic. Now, I regularly see tons of people already similarly geared out. Again, modern gaming has changed so people are much better at optimization, but the content is also being cleared easier due to the late patch and people being better in general. 
---
World PVP: The world feels different too. Might change with BGs but I don’t remember wPVP feeling obligatory. People are out there “farming honor” every day acting like that alliance they are camping isn’t a person. Admittedly, I didn’t play Vanilla before BGs, but I don’t remember the world being like this. Engineering is basically mandatory. There’s also a ton more people on each server than before and it’s noticeable. 
---
Farming/gold: I have no idea about farming. I make a shit ton more money now than I did in Classic but I also play a class with drastically different farming capabilities. I will say that resources/gear is very expensive because everyone is pretty aware of what materials need to be stockpiled, which gear will be BiS for future phases etc....
---
BGs will likely be very different too. Efficiency is the name of the game now. I’ve found that people don’t always want to do things for “fun” now if there’s not a direct and quantifiable benefit for them. I would not expect to have the fun AV next week, but the neutered version. That’s fine but I’d bet AV will be almost exclusively Zerg runs for maximum honor/hour.
---
Alliance confirmed worse faction.
---
&gt;A majority ? You have any kind of list of all of them?
---
I am so sorry I was wrong.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-update-schedule-and-free-character-moves/357529
---
ALL faction specific transfers were restricted to the alliance.
---
A horde account with an alliance account used to harm the alliance is literally 2 parties (2 characters). You moron.
---
I'm Horde and i left this shit already
---
Yeah I farm a couple for each raid night. It's easy. I don't really see a huge reason for you not to use them.
---
It’s not, playing without 305 skill is awful.
---
Eskhanders decent in absolute top tier guilds, but still worse than other options
---
We ended up with a hunter with TF near the end of Vanilla. Mostly because none of the newer warriors would spend DKP for the bindings hoping they would just be gifted them...
---
I think our guild is using monolith.  It's been quirky, but no real issues.
---
Too bad they won’t be able to do any high end enchants that come from raids.
---
Depends on queue times. If queues are long, it's worth squeezing the extra honor from gy camping for a few minutes.
---
Good Lord I would love this. Ele/Resto shaman with 31/21  for Nature's swiftness and Elemental mastery!
---
Im still standing! YEEH YEEH YEEEEH!!!
---
Step one: bring twice as many players as the alliance has on the server, let alone online.
---
Step two: seriously, what the fuck are they gonna do about it?
---
Im a rsham main, made a rogue just to kill something and not worry about mana. Been pretty darn fun!
---
Are you stupid? Yes, you will.
---
Ah, makes sense.  
---
The thing I love about this game is that there are level 29 items that are versatile enough to have endgame potential.
---
The only thing stopping me from farming more is the fear of dinging 30...nobody wants a level 30 cat running flags in 30-39 wsg.
---
Harder. More people= more competition in general. More try hards, more rankers, more premades.
---
1 crit = 30AP
---
Derive str and agi values from this, include kings if alli.
---
Hit over hit cap is almost worthless, like2-3 ap maybe
---
Yeah okay buddy, enjoy your false sense of superiority.

Indeed. The other races are more nuanced, with good and bad. The forsaken are downright evil. They are actively planning a plague to murder and zombify all of Azeroth. 
---
The fact that the Horde entertain the forsaken makes them a much, much darker shade of grey.
---
how do you not understand that with 50/50, it would be much harder for one side to dominate and you'd have a lot more back and forth rather than camping?
---
I'm not jumping on conclusion I was even about to tell you that de both have no actual proof of what we're talking about. People ranting aren't a proof and I think that you get that. Yet everyone talks like they have the knowledge about wtf is going on. I'm just trying to raise an alternate possibility
---
Pretty sure any town with a mine in it is destined to be miserable. Come back in ten years to find Moonbrook in ruins and striking miners being essentially the Defias 2.0.
---
Oh the classic boat gatekeeping or what? I enjoy not getting corpseganked wherever I go. Flamelash was ridicolous in that matter, now I can enjoy the game a little bit more.
---
If blizzard implemented faction based ques player who can't log in will spend thier time raging about blizzard is "big brother", blocking free will, pandering to pussies, etc. Then if blizzard keeps the que the ragers will feel neglected or spitted. 
---
 what if thier is just not enough PvP alliance overall. For example if the que is active when 60% of a realm's population is one faction and more than 60% of all PvP players of horde people will still be locked out. Then thier are all of the alliance players who want to be the majority on thier realm.

Do you approve of trying to scam people to maximize your gold earning?
---
wow they were so bad... but the rogue won and got the ore it looks like
---
This is the original comment.
---
&gt; In addition, it seems from videos that PVE server players are better geared due to more raiders. Nearly everyone has raid gear.
---
To which I responded:
---
&gt; Pve servers have way less raiders.
---
Seems perfectly accurate.
---
What does the ony scale cloak have to do with lionheart
---
It works, but it’s a pain because if you mess up at all, it does more harm than good by delaying a bloodthirsty or ww
---
You're *still* missing the point.  They're playing this game for fun, they shouldn't *have* to deal with constant corpse camping in the *hopes* that it'll improve - and it won't without Blizzard taking a hard stance on controlling the populations, we've seen how things have played out on retail over the last 15 years.
---
There is no fucking longevity, faction imbalancing is a snowballing effect and it'll never be fixed by the players themselves.  What you're arguing for is an idealized result that simply won't happen and will simply waste the time of people who do stick around.
---
So that makes it easier since more people can be in top brackets?
---
Badge is bis if no anni.
---
Plus he said “interesting” and sl/sl was anything but.
---
But also more positions in the brackets.  Instead of 1-2 people hitting bracket 1, current server sizes can hit 8-10.  All those try hards will be hitting HWL/GM faster because the amount of Honor Rating that is given out every week scales with the amount of people collecting honor.
---
Mouse buttons, then F keys for weapon swaps
---
I downvoted you not because you're wrong but because of how bad you explain it and how smug you sound.
---
I got 10g towards my lvl 40 mount with my male albino tauren in Org
---
Nice, rogue was shit thou.
---
Yes, paladins are known to stack proc effects.
---
The warsong charge glitch from the Alliance side to tunnel is longer.
---
Come run BRD with me. My 50 Holy Priest lives in the instance now. It took me 23 corpse runs to get to the instance yesterday. FML.
---
lol he called the minority cowards. You beat the one girlfriend you had too?
---
Meh. I doubt it. If you have an issue reroll to pve. 
---
I'm not a PVP guy although I play on a PVP server. It sucks to get Ganked for sure but you learn to deal with it.
---
Wasn't there an old MMO back in the day that was an RPG, but it was a weird clunky game where basically if you wanted to stop progressing your character and become a traveling merchant, you could, and the game required so much farming and grinding that people actually could carve out niches like that.
---
Can’t go daggers as fury in MC. Single target damage is mostly irrelevant for Mc
---
I meant instead of doing an auto attack that could glance + a bloodthirst you would do 2 slams so glance chance isn't as significant.
---
i bet orgrimmar is dead as hell on that server
---
There are few more satisfying things than watching a mage kill himself on your reflector as a warrior.
---
Running the attrition fight and forcing him to burn cds so he can finally line up his burst... only for it to backfire spectacularly.
---
&gt;  It's probably the biggest status symbol in the entire game and pretty much the only thing in classic that somewhat confirms you are good at the game.
---
Not really? It shows you have a lot of free time to put into this game, for whatever reason.
---
It's not the thing that shows you're good at the game.
---
Need more coffee with that joint.

---
Well, in the case of the shocky they had far less items involved. Divine favor holy shock + trinket, fireball helmet, and optional bomb. The warrior was doing it with much more and a 30 minute cooldown.
---
Pvp servers maybe not pve
---
Because there is no reason to have to tanks, and will just slow the run down. Having a fury warrior offtank 1 mob is not the same as having a second tank.
---
Do human rogues ever use dagger? Almost every human rogue I've met uses swords and they mentioned it's because of their racial.
---
Thinking of playing a human rogue but I prefer use daggers over swords(both in leveling and end-game)
---
&gt;You wont find a horde AV pug doing the backdoor jump with enough people for it to matter.
---
On day 1? Probably not, but I am pretty confident that it will eventually become the norm, as its just way easier to play out the BG that way.
---
Alliance can stop it obv by turtling hard, but then again that is also inefficient.
---
I have those two buttons on the side of my mouse, I use the first one for battle stance and the other one for defensive. I also have a macro on T which changes my stance to berserker stance and throws up berserkers rage, and if I press it again it puts me back into defensive stance. Makes the stance dancing quite easy at least for me.
---
When testing it, the bid window would randomly not pop up and all the officers kept getting pop-up warnings about syncing the dkp database. One officer was saying he kept getting actual Lua script errors popping up

Where is your Shadow Protection buff though? D:
---
Let me tell you as someone who has also started on thunderfury day one alliance.  Things have not improved.  I logged out two nights ago at lights hope chapel after being camped for about an hour.  Got on last night, again LHC was being camped by like the same 10 people.  Flightmaster was being killed instantly, 3 rogues in GY, and bunch in town.  Sat there for 2 hours watching tv and trying to rez just to be killed, worth zero honor to 95% of the people hitting me.  had to logon this morning at 5am before work so that I could hearth my character out of EPL.  I fear if WPvP doesn't chill out a bit Dec 10th, I'll have to wait for Thunderfury to die completely and wait for free transfers or wait for the paid option.  Just don't have the drive to level all over again.
---
Shit. Okay, I will def follow up. I’ve been leveling horde on westfall atm. Only level 5. Have a level 60 on sulfuras alliance side but I’m just really raid logging atm. :(
---
Sounds like you aren't spacing them out properly. My guild usually kills Rag in about 100 seconds so it's not usually an issue, but its higher now (about 140 seconds) that we raid in PVP specs so I know I'll have downtime on the pummeler. I don't blow all 3 charges back to back anymore. 
---
If your kill time is anything over 100 seconds, wait until just before a Wrath to use your next charge.  Whether you get knocked back or not, your threat is still dropped, so taunt and use pummeler to regain threat quickly. If you blow all 3 charges back to back, there will be 2 or so Wraths (assuming a 2 minute kill time) where you won't have a pummeler going, leading to dps slowly catching you in threat during Execute phase. Also, blow your AOE taunt when he's at like 5% percent hp.
---
I wrecked myself the other day with one of those, crib myself for 1800 damage
---
Ha. I'm an orc and that's exactly the swap I made, from Boneslicing Hatchet to Eskhandar's. I much prefer the Eskhandar's, for tanking anyways.
---
The sheet is fine. It overvalues hit past 6% but that's about it.
---
Alright, so it seems like weapon swing timer is not really necessary and trying to minimax windury procs us a net DPS loss because of the delayed BT.
---
You seem like a fucking loser
---
I think so?   Ret pally discord has Deamonshear as  a possible bis weapon for t0 when I thought it was Dreadforged retaliator
---
Peep Show is an absolute blast!
---
Original comment used "seems," your comment used an absolute "have" and you do not have the needed evidence to back your claim. You blocking me does me a favor.
---
Because not everyone is an orc/human warrior or can afford edge masters. Undead pvp focused warriors who tank for their guild can make great use of eshkanders. So can trolls and dwarves.
---
You still need a swing timer to play well
---
All I want to do is play bgs, I specifically re subbed just to play bgs, because wpvp is literally un playable in the current state of phase 2. 
---
Now everyone who was playing the whole time, have all these twinks, and bgs are literally unplayable, when is blizzard going to fix? /s
---
You worded it as if you were a total noob, which isn’t true. The title (and post tbh) in general is pretty bad.
---
That's OP!
---
Frostmane
---
Not to mention a vast majority of your rage in current content comes from being hit by the boss, not doing damage.
---
No. It probably won’t make much of a difference either way. Unless the player behaviors are different i.e. skewed towards higher play times than 2005, or a higher percentage of people playing in premades, or relatively more people flying to Searing Gorge to gank while waiting in BG queue, etc.
---
Weebs deserve the gallows
---
Not sure if it stacks on top of itself but if so wow, doubt it does or this would be dooable you couuld just get a full pack of high atk speed baddies and let this stack forever and never die.
---
Or thought critically for 10 seconds it seems
---
We did that but while making things easier, it didn't help much to compensate the lack of rage. Especially if there are multiple mage mobs.
---
If you're going for end game raids the human racial +5 swords is pretty much the best thing ever. It's basically 3% free hit chance.
---
Ash the memelord!
---
Is it possible to get rank 13-14 if you are in brackets 2-5?
---
This is why making a bunch of mega servers was not a good idea for vanilla
---
Faction based queues were done in private servers. They didnt work.
---
The deathwing mount is so easy and fast to get, took maybe an hour tops for me.
---
It's a gold plated Feral item. Good stats but not a huge upgrade.
---
However if you have one as a Feral, it's still nice. It's just excessive. If you're willing to craft it, fair enough. But it shouldn't be on your radar as any druid.
---
The add-ons are not correctly calculating it.  You're missing the point here.
---
r/wooosh
---
People don't understand how important weapon skill is for all warrior specs. That's why you see people using it. Also people read up and see that it's BiS on some sites without tanking into account they mean BiS on infinite rage fights, which there aren't any right now.
---
It was sarcasm...
---
It's a joke about the Guy in the screenshot..

I now have a headache

It was sarcasm brotha...

Ornate Spyglass currently increases draw distance by a lot.

Blizzard has completely lost any control of this.

Awful damage, takes a debuff slot.
---
You cannot pvp and raid without being in an awful pug that doesn’t care about your spec
---
[Icy Veins guide to Honor](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/honor-system-overview) 
---
Basically you get honor points for kills and from battlegrounds.  At the end of the week, people are placed into brackets, sorted by total honor gained that week.  Those at the top are given 13,000 honor rating.  Those in the middle are given between 12,999 and 1, depending on their bracket and their placement within that bracket.
---
What’s critical is that the *size* of those brackets is determined by how many players are being evaluated.  So, if a server has 4x the population as it did 15 years ago, the brackets will be 4x as large.  More people just means more people - it does not make it any harder to compete for the top.
---
That's fine.  The current numbers are estimates as is.
---
man WSG hph (honor per hour ) is so much better. thats why ur getting downvoted.
---
If the brackets are broken down by percentiles then wouldn't there just be 10x as many rank 13s and 12s? So the increased population would just make it harder for rank 14 where only one player a week can get it right?
---
Prot Warriors Finally Relevant!
---
looks like they get to wait for wotlk classic then
---
I see, I'll try your suggestion of 2-handing that part, though it will be a pain to change my macros because I got most of them to change to 1H+Shield automatically.
---
I use rank 4 healing touch as my normal heal. I believe thats the rank thats a half second faster than the rank above it. I mix in a full rank rejuvenate on the main tank. I use natures swiftness + max HT as a panic mode. Regrowth is convenient and quick but not mana effcient. Only use if you need a fast big heal and have plenty of mana. Dont be afraid to pop tranquility when applicable.
---
TLDW; run to ironforge.
---
Grats, now you know the secret.
---
Steppens sheet overvalues hit over cap
---
Please do not use the claw as an orc. Stick to axes. You will not be raged capped in this phase if you are playing properly, the bosses don't hit hard enough. Being consistently rage capped right now speaks to not using your rage properly. 
---
Again, the "smooth vs spiky" rage gain argument is also silly. A huge amount of your rage is due to incoming damage in the current content, not the damage you put out.
---
Also for enhance its only good for pvp.
---
Excluding rank 14 since theres only 1 a week right?
---
I'm sure they can scrounge up enough people/alts....then you can fully control the brackets and totally eliminate the no life part of the r14 grind
---
Come on, lol
---
Seeing this for some reason made me a little happier
---
In dungeons it’s fine, on trash pulls start with a 2h sweeping strike, blood rage whirlwind for threat then swap to sword and board. 
---
If you’re doing raids it’ll be rough and likely not anything more then sunderspam as an 3rd tank compared to someone that’s fury/deep prot.
---
Here is my perspective as an Arms warrior and GM of a casual raiding guild that knocks out MC and Ony in one go each week.
---
First, fury warriors do more damage than arms warriors, particularly on single targets. There’s not much debate there.
---
Second, Arms warriors can still pour out damage and out-dps a number of other classes/specs. This will be less evident as you put more points into PvP talents (eg Piercing Howl). But you’re not going to be close to last on dps.
---
My view on Mortal Strike is this... yes, it takes up a debuff slot that would otherwise add more damage. BUT, mortal strike itself is a high damage ability that is going to contribute to raid dps. If I hold off on MS and it costs me 10k damage in a fight, would that debuff slot be worth more than 10k for other uses? Perhaps...
---
Ultimately it comes down to (1) your preferred play style and (2) your guild leadership’s preferences. Our raid leader has raided for world firsts and actively endorses my spec because he knows it’s fun, it spreads out loot more, and he knows we will do just fine with an arms warrior in a raid. Perhaps it will be less tenable for future content— we will see. 
---
TL;DR: Yes, you will do less dps. If you enjoy arms and your guild/raid leadership are OK with it, then fuck it— do it live, brother.
---
We kill it in about 1:45. You're propably right I can delay the last charge a little to have it up towards the end.
---
Every single post you make floors me man. It makes me want to lock myself in my room and work on 3D and compositing until I can understand how you do this black magic.
---
For leveling/grinding, druids have sooo much gas, you are pretty much never sitting for food or water because you can heal and you regen mana in your forms so yeah.
---
I tanked from 10 to 60 as a bear tank and its great. I recommend you spec as 0/30/21 or 1/29/21, also called hotw/ns spec. 
---
Like the poster above said, you regrowth/rejuve pre pull and then tab maul and you're good.
---
I recommend focussing on bear talents with a sprinkling of cat. Feel free to pick up Feline Swiftness and the extra combo point talent, but they are not totally necessary. Work on getting a healer set too so you can heal but you can feasibly tank from 10 to 60 and never heal a dungeon. I did that and am healing in raids now.
---
Anyways, enjoy your bear tank. Its hella fun and feral charge is the tits.
---
Well thats why i said some type of dkp system. Idk why you took that as dkp alone as there are several variations of it now that try avoiding what youre talking about from happening.
---
I doubt it. Horde absolutely destroy us.
---
Still sounds like one tenth of the work of gjetting r14 on an average realm.
---
Ah, I see you are with Nietzsche there. I think you present a valid point, and I like your perspective on this. Thank you for taking the time to explain this.
---
Let us say, intellectually, I can see what might drive people to do this. Emotionally, not at all. To me it would feel like strangling a lion cub: Sure, I would have killed a wild and dangerous animal with my bare hands, but it's not like it was any danger to me and I'd feel bad about it. And I would certainly wait for the mother to come home. (Note: This is just a metaphor, I don't condone killing wild animals for joy at all).
---
Took a 10 person all lvl 60s to LBRS the other night as a we all wanted to chill and not have to think too hard. Good times were had.
---
You couldn't servertrans on private servers obviously. The point is to make more Horde swap servers because they get higher queues than alliance players. Also with faction based queues it should be possible to get a ~50:50 population on peak times.
---
It's so freaking neckbeard to use the term "cringey". Makes me think you're a cringey female neckbeard.
---
Yeah I would love a wow where we finally got to enjoy peace... but then again it'd be super boring. Love the idea of Westfall finally returning to normal though.
---
I expected ganking and camping, and general mayhem.  I didn't expect it to continue for hours after I'm worth no honor.  The amount of people that will kill you just so you can't play and not for actualy honor is absurd.  but hey "iTs a pvP SeRvEr"
---
This is what I use, works like a charm. Also have weapon swaps macroed into my stances
---
After 40 mins I gave up trying to get to DM. Alliance literally had the entire area camped from Mojache to the DM entrance................EVERYWHERE.........4 corpse runs just to get 200 yards from the town.
---
Than I went to farm some mats in Tanaris. There were so many alliance they literally were killing horde, in town, on site.
---
It's the 'nochanges' peoples fault. For some reason they were quiet when Blizzard announced they were going to increase server caps this time around.
---
While modern technology allows for more people connected, it doesn't change the fact that when the world was created it was designed for fewer players. 
---
Lets say there are 40 NPC guards at Theramore. Lets also say it's being raided by 50 horde while 30 alliance defend. If we count the NPC as players it can be viewed as a 50vs70 in favor of the alliance. Now lets do what classic did, and triple the allowed players. We now have 150 horde on attack, 90 alliance on defense, but the NPCs stay the same at 40 because NPCs were not changed. It's now 150vs130 in favor of the Horde.
---
Being aware of where Mage’s are and avoiding cs.  Wear plate so you can tank a rogue or warrior a few seconds.  Using HoJ at opportune times.  BoF and BoP at the right times.  
---
Using the entire tool kit is insane from an offensive standpoint and they are inherently defensive as a class.
---
I know its far into the future, but with no alliance on your server you will not be able to get into AQ, so if you are a raider, it aint that good :P
---
Haha I know it’s a bit of a shitshow at the moment but I love PvP - think I’m going to find a server which isn’t super high population and has an equal faction balance. Let me know if you know of such a server!
---
Yeah but to compare them to WoW's graphics is a bit of a stretch. I think swtor looks far better. The world and characters.
---
Heroic Strike was a large proportion of my damage back then. At the current lower gear levels of Classic that might not be the case. I'm not playing warrior for Classic so haven't looked too deeply into it.
---
37% alliance, 63% horde level 60s. No wonder I'm miserable
---
Thanks for the clip! It’s one of the best ways I’ve found so far to highlight the problem.
---
Then you should be on a pve server.
---
the one in booty bay/Everlook/Gagetstan
---
It doesn't emulate my vanilla experience.  For me, it emulates the private server experience.  I personally think the higher realm pops are the cause for many gripes and complaints I read and hear throughoutthe community.  That coupled with the community itself, it just makes the experience more akin to private servers than my recollection of Vanilla.  I just don't think the experience can be recreated but that's okay.  I'm still enjoying what Blizz has created even if it's not everything I had hoped for.  I do wish realm pops were more in line with Vanilla but I don't think they can, or will, undo that decision.
---
Had a blast at first  until i eventually regretted pvp server pick. I realized i just enjoy skilling and running dungeons.  A lot of my friend group also didnt end up playing so its gotten lonely. Will def paid transfer my higher lvl characters to a pve realm whenever its available. Wont be playing till then
---
The public perception is that horde has better pvp racials, so you might get 40% of people choosing alliance because they want to be alliance, 40% of people choosing horde because they want to be horde and 20% of people choosing horde because they want the "best" pvp option, causing a 60/40 unbalance. And then once there is an unbalance it can quickly become very miserable to play as the outnumbered faction because you might not be able to do anything without dying repeatedly, which means that the people of the underdog faction transfer or quit, making the problem even worse over time.
---
Wait til lvl60 we aren’t strong
---
That's it, I recommend using a tank for randoms just to make things easier.
---
Do not go leatherworking. Nothing is bop so you can get it easier from someone else. Enchanting for smoking heart of the mountain is the only profession you need. After that you can drop enchanting and use what ever you want. Engineering is popular for pvp.
---
Restraint can go a long way
---
Also, it's 2019, people/guilds are giving them to "meme specs/classes" for this exact reason, so people will question it and make reddit threads! My thoughts before classic hit was that if I ever made a guild and went into raiding, I would give the first TFs and Rags to the not intended classes, just so people in orgrimmar would think "wtf are those people/guild doing?!? IDIOTS" and then continue to flame and keep telling me/us how we are supposed to enjoy the game and the correct way.
---
Sure, TF and Rag is better and more optimal on other classes/specs, but it's a game, it's about having FUN. Meme'ing is fun!
---
The instant bingo thing is funny
---
Old nelves are the ones who summoned the burning legion the first time around.
---
Why force queues when pop is low? The problem arises when shitloads of players are hogging the server. The number at when queues start stays the same as it is now, the queue just favors the faction with less players from then on. Also i really meant as tool in combination of server transfers. Blizzard already fucked up.
---
If you're dotting something it's a kill target usually. But as ret, in 1v1 repentance is vital for waiting out swing timers and CDs. Unless you're killing the target in a HoJ the proc can end up killing you
---
It's funny when people think alliance are just the good guys.
---
"Dude why are you playing a fem toon you gay or something?" 
---
I remember, good times.
---
The easy way to understand brackets is, if you are in that bracket for long enough, you will reach that rank.  So if bracket 1 is rank 1 and bracket 14 is rank 14, if you only average bracket 11, you will never make rank 12 no matter how many weeks you play.  But you can push hard to get into higher brackets for a few weeks to get the higher rank and then drop down again.
---
&gt;*Its also the 1.12.1 version of AV (basically the retail version)*
---
Wait, it's the shitty 600 reinforcement version?
---
I don't understand why people want to be on low population servers anyway.. Of course you will be one of the first servers to die.  That is why I always choose the most populated server because I will be last to die as a server.  Herod ftw!!!
---
Downvotes give me joy, just like dks
---
Trolls have been raiding killing and cannibalizing humans and elves for hundreds of years
---
Then Orcs came along and did the same thing to humans and elves
---
Nightelves we're the first to fight off demons from the burning legion and made it their mission to perserve the world tree, then these Demonic servants known as orc come invade their homeland and cut down their forests so they could build a big mud-hut.
---
I mean you could also literal fire balls would kill someone instantly
---
The best advice for a warrior is get better gear and find a healer. Most classes have tools to beat a warrior solo.
---
Don't worry too much about it. The game is not designed to be balanced in regards to PvP below max level.
---
The nochanges crowd did nothing for it. Blizzard's slow rollout of servers led to it.
---
Extra spells being slung against extra health bars. It's not just the number of extra enemies that increases in these scenarios.
---
For a game where every tactics video on YouTube amounts to a class in freaking astrophysics, there are a lot of people who aren't very good at math.
---
I'm not talking about fairness, I'm talking about a broken incentive system. Wpvp without the honor system is fine, even when it's unfair. Otherwise decent people aren't incentivized to act like total twats without the honor system. Sure you still have a few sociopath corps campers or flight path campers or people killing lowbies, but not everyone is motivated to act like a complete ass. The honor system takes otherwise honorable people and turns them into slavering honor zombies.
---
What race + weapon are u using? What spare gear do u have to swap in?
---
This has gotten really contrived when it started with you not making a clear point lol, and none of that means anything I said was wrong.
---
Same thing on zandalari\_tribe-EU but alliance make horde to quit playing
---
Only run 40 times, never even seen the boss
---
I mean I've seen the guild recruit sticky but if you sort the comments by new you'll note that there has been 1 new post in the last 3 weeks lol. I just assumed no one really uses that actively, hence asking.
---
That site is laughably inaccurate. It has my server as 96% alliance. We're more like 35–40%.
---
And saves Jaima from the patriarchy. Zug Zug.
---
As a healer I hate it too, the undead mobs do so much damage in a short time.
---
That might happen on private due to the lower player pool, but this is cross realm BGs. By your logic no one but the most elite esports competitors should be playing StarCraft II or Overwatch competitive by now, which very obviously not the case.
---
&gt;But at the same time, what can blizzard do that they haven't already done?
---
They haven't done anything but kick the can down the road, I think faction based queues is the only meta option available.
---
Or just when the horde camp the menethil boat
---
&gt;Theres often a window of opportunity you need to act within else the target gets away.
---
I think thats the fucking point of having them be honorless because they just loaded a new zone. It isn't fair to land at their destination and be engaged upon before they are ready to fight. They should be given the chance at applying their own buffs and scouting the area. Plus they could be lagged.
---
Stop camping flight paths you noob.
---
Oh fuck lol that sounds bad actually. Yeah I did it week one but we only wiped on Rag
---
We have several in our guild
---
Well thats some RNG gods... 4% instant shadowbolt one after another and both crits....
---
Orc racial stun resist
---
How highly geared do you need to be to solo everything? Guessing you were using a 2H and SS + WW?
---
There isn't. For there to be a higher number of extra enemies present yet maintain the same percentage, there has to be a proportionately higher number of friendlies as well.
---
Basic maths.
---
We have victory!!
---
It actually blows my mind there weren't faction limits. Why would you allow your game to be so imbalanced?
---
ZF as a duo makes as much as the mage would make solo, divided by 2 lmao
---
Not even close baby

You left out one of the chief characters: 'Hogger the brave!” I want to hear more about Hogger
---
Yeah to be honest I can't reach ctrl+0, I bound it for consistency but I don't tend to use it :p  
---
Most of the macros you only have to press once, if it is just swapping stance and casting an ability.
---
`#showtooltip Intercept`
---
`/cast Berserker Stance`
---
`/cast Intercept`
---
since changing stances doesn't trigger a global cooldown.  (Though you will need tactical mastery so that you can keep enough rage when you change stance for it to work).
---
The only ones that need to be spammed are the ones which equip a weapon or sword/shield (which I think I only have on shield bash and shield wall)
---
Hey there DrTerrible.
---
I mean, yesterday we had people in the daily question thread asking if Elemental Sharpening Stone worked for a hunter's ranged attack, so we didn't change that much tbh.
---
We use guilded
---
Dkp rewards effort, and let's people feel they earn something for their effort, it is entirely unfair in a raid of 40 people to win a roll that you would never have had without the whole group.
---
When does it get replaced?
---
[Here's the skit in reference if you haven't seen it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU)
---
&gt; You have Ironforge.pro which is a perfectly fine way to gauge population ratio
---
That only shows users from raids where people bothered to log and upload, it's far from accurate and likely skewed towards alliance.
---
You shouldn't allow the paladin to touch you. Fear, DoT them, and DPS while the fear lasts. Fear them again two more times and then run away while waiting for fear diminishing returns to go away.
---
Get a diminishing returns tracking addon for your Fear.
---
If you see a glowing bubble around them then they are currently immune to everything so wait for it to go away.
---
Paladins can't dispel magic effects until level 40-something.
---
Paladins are an easy kill for warlocks.
---
Its dumb to say Blizzard wants to keep their sub, but then imply they should lock out more then 50% of their player base with factions ques.
---
I love this attitude of like "the horde deserve queues!" just cause we are the over populated faction and happen to PvP. 
---
I honestly have no idea what alliance want horde players to do. my server is really balanced in terms of PvP at lvl 60 but even on worse servers idk what those horde players should do, just stop playing the game or what? let the alliance kill them?
---
I believe AV zergs are the BEST way to farm honor, 'mathmatically' speaking, not sure about the exact number as it's from a ranking discord.
---
Do BFD &amp; RFK quests
---
Your welcome to do so :) I understand if it's not a popular opinion but I could never take the game seriously unfortunately:/ still tried to play it a lot though
---
"If its a stupid piece of gear the answer is shaman, paladin, or hunter" :( this is why all gear is hunter gear im taking lock robes next time in his honor.
---
Let's say it's like a venomstrike that procs several times a fight... (I doubt that,  but for argument's sake).
---
It's basically bad in a 1 v 1.
---
That doesn't make the weapon bad for pvp.  Most pvp isn't fair 1 v 1s. 
---
It's a great weapon then, right?
---
Back to retail, this is literally the vanilla experience.
---
I used to sell soap
---
I am also on smolderweb. The balance seems ok here and there is active world PvP groups on both factions. The server doesn’t feel dead
---
You need to cut in a [Goofy scream](https://youtu.be/L2hCgtpMlHk?t=56).
---
&gt;It's math. Simple math.
---
Yet you keep getting it wrong. 
---
A 50% advantage is a 50% advantage, regardless of how many players are involved.
---
Dude, you're not getting showered in downvotes because you're making a coherent argument. I don't know what to tell you.
---
Have a nice day.
---
It’s a skill jump, not incredibly easy, so I would predict the horde will find it easier to afk for losses.
---
Haha you can see the defeated look on his face, he just stops moving at that point
---
Eh, I pretty much never go oom on trash, and I have pots/runes for bosses when I do. While .15% crit isn't that meaningful, it's better than mana regen that I don't need. But this depends on your guild and gear so ymmv
---
The hand is 100% a pvp weapon.  Depending on the size of your server the ingots might be hard to come by.  So you sell the ingots to the person who wins it at a discount.  It's a common pattern and that money goes into consumables for tanks / heals during progression.  It's a win win.
---
Only a terrible guild (or a guild of RL friends funneling resources to RL friends) would give the ingots to their memespec.
---
Thanks for the insight. I'm not max level yet but I believe my guild runs are partial pugs to fill the slots, so I'm hoping no one scrutinizes my spec lol.
---
We found him!
---
The darkspear aren't cannibals and left stranglethorn because of it. 
---
The orcs severed their ties to demons and lost the blood rage. Did you play warcraft?
---
It's only as good as the information that's inputed.
---
Nope.
---
&gt;it doesn't change the fact that when the world of warcraft was created it was designed for fewer players.
---
Private servers also disproved that statement, the had literally up to 3x the concurrent cap and they worked fine.
---
Fiery weapon and +100 health. Maybe buy a set of greens level 20-30 of the Bear. Of the bear just means it gives stamina and strength.
---
Alliance are less likely to want to PvP in the first place, so even if a group is nominally 45–55, chances are the BG queues will be more like 40/60 or 35/65.
---
Hand of rag beats unstoppable force into the dirt even for non memespec like warriors. But yeah better options exist outside of that so it’s for meme specs.
---
For pvp or Pve? Pve you need 6% and 205 weapon skill. For pvp I would try to replace the leather gear.

Said video is an example of the bug that exists with vanish currently, with BRD pickpocket runs being a main source of gold for rogues this can be infuriating
---
Dear lord... that’s lvl 1-60
---
Now set it to level 60 only and stop being delusional.
---
You picked ez mode faction, deal with it
---
phew, no idea.  it was something around lvl 40, a one handed weapon.  I flipped it asap for 20g .  if you can be bothered to list all weapons that fit that description, I probably could point at one and say: 'yes that's the one'
---
I think you mean Earth Shock? If so then, it depends on the level of the Shaman. 'Which one does more damage' swaps as they get each rank.
---
Everyone will be rushing but I don't think it will work as well as people want to think it will.  Sure you can rush and hold the base.  Grats?  You need to get rid of the Captain and other tower NPCs.  Otherwise it will be a string of constant wipes at the General.  The rush will be to take down the towers as well as getting to the General.  But any defense at the towers or at the general will stymie your efforts and result in your loss, if you don't have the same defense.
---
This isn't the fully nerfed, just run in and tank the General and you win AV.  You must take down towers or you will wipe, 100%.

Flight path has rogues, these allies are killing people on their bank alts.
---
Stat prioritization question
---
When do we choose strength over crit?
---
Does 1 STR = 1.3 AGI?
---
At what crit% should you start building AP?
---
At what AP should you focus crit?
---
I am currently at about 800 AP with 21 crit, but I have basically every plate piece so I can play with AP and crit. I am hit capped
---
Basically this. Paladins have no increased movement (unless spec into) and no slows. Only 1 cc on a 1 minute cooldown. 
---
No counters to fear (except bubble and trinkets). As a lock, should be neigh impossible for them to stick to you. Thus, you gotta fear and keep your distance. Dont stand  in one spot casting shadow bolts. DoT, fear, run, rinse repeat.
---
There's one guild &lt;Leftovers&gt; that are staying soley so they can attempt to get R14 using a bunch of alts.  Its like 18 people I think.
---
Honestly, this is such a known thing that I doubt it's going to be that worth it.
---
Almost all the "invest your gold in this to make insane money when x drops" have pretty much proven to be oversaturated because everyone is doing it.
---
Stacking to get sapper charged?
---
Still have yet to fight a rogue who didn't prep.
---
Even if i lose, at least i know they're burning 2 blinding powders and 2 flash powders. It's a battle of attrition, really.
---
the tooltip was different back then though iirc
---
I’d be curious what they would have to offer players for people to want a “faction change.” Not sure how that would even work, but it’s an idea.
---
&gt; Sounds like you chose servers poorly.
---
I think you meant: "Sounds like you chose *Alliance* poorly."
---
Flamelash is high pop
---
If you’re going to sit down and play for an hour and your goal is to get exalted with AV or gain pvp ranks - would you want to win one 45 min long AV or win four 15 min AVs??  Hmmmmmmm...
---
Because for a vast majority of people on unbalanced pvp servers where the game is currently unplayable for an entire faction,  if bgs don't fix the issues the option is transfer to pve or quit.
---
Of course he disregarded it, the data you posted is so old it's no longer even relevant to the conversation at hand.
---
&gt; but the most elite esports competitors should be playing StarCraft II or Overwatch competitive by now, which is very obviously not the case.
---
ranking in those games places you against people of the same skill or so, not the case in classic WoW
---
Stam is also much higher at those gear levels, but yea naxx gear will 1 or 2 shot people who aren't in naxx gear
---
Sweeping strikes whirlwind combo helps for initial threat if you are arms. Otherwise what I do is mark the non elite casters for dps to blast down and focus mostly on tanking the 2-3 elites, dps should be able to handle the non elites relatively quickly without you holding threat on them as long as they are focusing on one at a time
---
its a huge cost for so little gain.  only a server first makes sense to fund quickly as a group and even then it should be paid back.
---
its completely unrealistic to think your guild is going to invest 10k of rare materials into a pvp weapon for one person.
---
I leveled a warrior in classic as my first wow character ever, despite everyone saying it was “so awful” and I had no issues! Now that I’ve played other classes sure they are easier, but it’s not bad on its own.
---
It is basically blizzards fault yes but in the end people pushed for #nochanges. Like they pushed for a lot of changes that ruined retail. In the end I think blizzard tends to listen too much to their players.
---
I honestly dont remember. The current tooltip implies that it only gives 2% on the weapon that it is applied to, which is incorrect though. Isnt it?(i.e. you can get 4% from dual wielding it)
---
Most I bring is food and a couple of mongoose pots at this stage.
---
Uh.. just fear them. Paladins dont have anything to deal with fear on themselves except bubble.  
---
So the general gameplan is.. yeah fear, dot them up and keep them max distance. Paladins have zero ways of closing distance, while they *do*
---
Oh my god swg was unplayable when I first got it because the lag was so bad.  I wound up being a pilot because flying in space was the only thing my comp could handle
---
Rough and scratchy and frays? Huh, I bet I know what kind of fabric they used; I bought some gold woven stuff that was like that. Beautifully shiny, but once you cut it out it frayed like the threads were alive and trying to get away from each other.
---
The big packs in strat just focus on holding aggro on the 3 elite zombies. Let your dps kill/tank the non elites. In general, prioritize what you need to tank, is it a high damage mob? You shld prolly grab it, is it a mob with a sword and shield that is tanky but doesnt do anything else, not super important you pick it up right away. The exception is always peel off your healer.
---
got a link to that one by chance?
---
Maybe actually read the lore instead of blindly speculating
---
At what crit % should we focus on building AP? Or is there an AP goal and build to crit? I am hit capped OEB with 6 hit on orc.
---
I have read all of your stuff on Icey a bunch and really appreciate it!
---
IA! IA!
---
No.  That is a solo player weapon.  It isn't great to use in PVE content when you could have like bonereavers, obsidian edged blade, or actually two one handers.  
---
Maybe if you were a huge committed player that did a lot of guild activities and were very active.  He can barely make all the raids.  There is no way in azeroth that his guild should fund his hand of rag.  The only exception would be give him maybe a 150g-250g discount on ingots.
---
How would you go about leveling at 52 right now?
---
BRD takes a while to set up a group, and when you finally find a group, it takes everyone 60 minutes to get to instance
---
Questing, well, impossible.
---
Paladins are one of the strongest twink characters for the lower brackets where Warlocks really shine at higher levels. It'll get easier.
---
This makes me want to play the game more than the game.
---
We can pretend "own" means something else but the dude posted a screenshot where Alliance clearly do not "own" Orgrimmar anywhere near as bad as Horde owns IF on Flamelash now.
---
How in demand are restorative potions going to be for battlegrounds? Is it worth farming elemental earth now?
---
Hi razorgore
---
You should go to a PvE server.  I heard they like softies/snowflakes like yourself.
---
????
---
That's not what i said ffs.
---
Flamelash was a pretty big server on EU.
---
 server was 2906 horde 2175 alliance a few weeks ago.
---
Is it possible to use Berserk er rage to break fear?  or do you have to cast it before getting feared in the first place.
---
No, that's exactly what it does. Applying a stone doesn't give you 2% crit across the board.
---
I blindly picked Mograine on launch day and feel like I won the lottery.

How can you do the quest as horde and think you are good guys? Hillsbrad farmers just want to farm and raise a family. The night elfs in ashenvale just want to live with nature.
---
Resto pot removes one debuff every 5s, which will most likely be one of the dots.
---
At 40% health and below is when you get the full 30% haste.
---
I love pvp as well but the current state of the game cant be called pvp. Its excessive ganking by one sided factions. I hope you find a balanced server. I can promise you that smolderweb is very unbalanced in favor of horde. Most areas feel like 7 to 1
---
I don’t think you being around on 12/5 would have made a huge difference in all honesty. Might be time to take your 60paladin/52warrior and chalk them up as lost and move on.
---
Forreal! Warcraft is almost like a representation of humanity or something... I always laugh when one tries to justify one side over the other. We are all terrible
---
I play Horde
---
What difference would it make? ~60% of people on PvP servers are playing Horde. No matter the number of servers or the population cap on servers, there would still be ~60% Horde on every server, on average.
---
last warcraftlogs show 55/45 horde alliance based on just over 6k players.
---
Sorry the night elves sacrificed their home to save the world. Only for their new home to get burned down by a crazy lady.
---
Horde Dominates. They put the allies like Domino pieces, set to fall at once
---
Guy on our server tried that. Got blacklisted for being a DBag then a pattern dropped the next week and that guy had sane crafting prices and made like 15k gold.
---
Aggro retention will be a lot easier when you hit 60. If I am really struggling with large mobs I will charge in with my 2h, whirlwind, switch to shield and defensive. You take more damage but will help them stay on ya. Easier for healer to only heal you vs heal 3 ppl who pulled
---
Horde is always gonna hold BRM on almost any server because Kargath is the unnoficial secondary horde capital. There's no horde city anywhere near it and you kinda have to have your hearthstone set there at least some of the time if you're a raider.
---
*whiff*
---
Paid transfers.  There, done.  Everyone is happy.  Blizzard is really happy.
---
The end.
---
&gt; scarlet light worshiper
---
What the hell is that supposed to even mean ?
---
I think the point is that world size is not scaling. So higher pop is more problematic because there are no empty space in the world. Lower pop but same % is tolerable because dominant faction cant cover the whole map
---
Not sure on that one.
---
Modern player my ass. 60-40 when there were 3000 players isn't so bad. When it's 20k in the same space those 3000 used to be it sucks.
---
Yeah but herod is PvE for horde, alliance leaving in droves. Faerlina is probably safest or Whitemane/Incendius/Grobbulus
---
Look again.   Just because the alliance town hide like plebs doesn’t mean unbalanced.
---
A lot bigger edge for AV tho
---
I don't disagree with what you said but you have to keep in mind that ressources like black lotus were increased on private. That might Come into an issue down the road
---
True
---
you could go 21/0/31 as a Resto druid and get Nature's Grace in addition to Swiftmend.  Wouldn't be op but would certainly make Druid's more competitive in raid healing.  Nature's Grace already lets them compete on metres, giving them access to both NG and Swiftmend would be very powerful
---
Orc with Viskag. I have 27.8% crit and 12% hit. Should I drop devilsaur gauntlets for edgemasters?

I think it is the preaching in between the verses of the songs but I absolutely can't listen to them

and yet it's right between IF and SW lol
---
Is Shadow Protection a big deal? I really only have a rough idea what abilities I need to get so I didn't bother with it.
---
I don't enjoy killing lower level players but when all the 60s just hide in iron forge instead of being out there protecting their lower levels, it makes killing them the only way to gain ranks.
---
According to:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/
---
Thunderclap rank 5 would do (130+82)*0.8 threat, this is 170 threat on 4 mobs. Not bad but a solid dynamite thrown in defensive should generate 325 on all mobs (250+1.3), a dense would generate 520 on all mobs. Maybe WW is something I should be adding to my rotation, it is just frustrating to be banking rage, switch stances and lose it all. WW is weapon damage on 4 mobs which is around 100 threat per mob without the stance threat reduction dropping it down to 80 threat. And again, it is only on 4 mobs
---
Netherwind, Benediction,  Earthfury, Kurinnaxx, rattlegore, Incedius, and Grobbulus seem to be the most balanced
---
Me too!
---
it's a server specific one, but I havent seen the math behind it apart from trusting people that are planning on ranking heavily
---
A good reminder that WPvP is working as intended and that PVP is indeed happening on PVP servers
---
Looks like a gipsy trade
---
I always kept my gloves updated with +5 str, my bracer with +7 str, my boots with movement speed, and my weapons with either fiery weapon or crusader (I was basically trying to waste money at that point though, crusader isn't necessary).

Proof is right here boys

---
Wtf are you smoking?
---
It’s 57/43.  Horde have a slight lead.  Try checking the correct dates fool.
---
Mana potions, mp5 fish is all you really "need".
---
You can easily get by without them if you're not trying to top meters.
---
It does not solve the issue at all for people who do not want to pay to leave a server and only hastens the decline on servers on the edge.  Paid server transfers is the thing which is more responsible for how the game has developed than any other change in wow's history.
---
&gt;Free-for-all PvP servers require self-moderation by the players. I think this worked back in the day because players as whole were a bit more considerate of others, including those of the opposing faction. Not as many were out to actively ruin the playtime of others. Griefing happened, sure, but it was rare enough that, even all these years later, the specific instances of it happening stand out in my memory. Now it is a non-stop thing the whole time you're logged in.
---
I think you've hit the nail on the head. I've never been into PvP in MMORPGs, but back in my EQ days, everything I ever heard about the PvP servers painted a picture similar to what you describe. What I see happening these days seems very different.
---
Is it worth making target macros just to grab the elites, is there such a thing as a target macro that allows me to tab only through elites?
---
Ive been basing it off of this https://i.imgur.com/YvpQTMP.png
---
Are there any Ally dominated EU PvP servers?
---
As others have mentioned, Major Mana, Dark/Demonic Rune, Nightfin, Mana Oil, Mageblood, are the main consumes for healers. They also bring Fire / Arcane / Nature / Shadow protection pots like everyone else, but tend to only use one to prepot since they get more mileage out of Mana Pots.
---
I would urge you to try and stockpile these pots, or mats for them, now. While in the current content you'll likely only use 1-5 a week, if you're planning on raiding AQ+Naxx your usage will increase sharply.
---
You may also want to get some Elixir of Fortitude / Flask of the Titans / Elixir of Poison Resistance for AQ+Naxx. There's still debate about which flask is best for healers between Titans and Wisdom. I strongly prefer Titans, especially for Priests. You can get mana from consumes, you can't heal when you're dead.
---
Bro just reroll on Firemaw or Gehennas and this won't happen to you again. At this point there's nothing you can do. Leveling is much faster every next time
---
Imagine camping people 10 to 1 for hours and hours and hours at every flight path and instance entrance and thinking you shouldn't be held responsible for the impact that you caused.
---
Holy fuck you're still missing it. Get your head out of the weeds with and stop focusing on part of one sentence and reread my comments/post for the theme. Which I summed up nicely for you a couple of comments up. 
---
But again...
---
I'm not saying bis lists are bad or spell cleave or any one little thing. It's the general overkill that IM critical of. There are a group of players so focused on hyper efficiency that they have literally nothing left to do in the game besides ruin my playing experience. I don't think I'm being hypocritical at all by bitching about that.
---
I think ST grinds might be pretty decent at that level.  But dungeon grinding will be the way to go no matter what.  I used to wake up early before work and park my character at BRD, ez walk when no one is on.  Then in the evening logon and in and make sure you /join lookingforgroup and find a group and be sure to mention you are already there.
---
I agree with you.  Resources are not scaled to match demand.  The world is not scaled to match (population density).  And, gold economy is way out of tune with so many people in the world.  I don't like the realm pops as they are.
---
Whats wrong with Atlast loot?
---
Blizzard is absolutely responsible for making their game playable.  
---
They completely fucked up the launch, and then added servers to ameliorate the issues caused by that failure and in doing so they irreparably ruined server balance beyond any recognition.
---
Anything that warrants more than a line here? Just people calling me a creep for asking a question.
---
Also you're a scrub if you're using the new reddit UI.
---
It was a thanksgiving pug run and I was the only dw fury warrior at the time. I’d rather have deathbringer BUT I would rather have viskag over nothing. Plan is to get brutality blade OH so I would need edgemasters anyways right
---
As others have said, pvp servers no longer exist, but they also don’t have any reason for world pvp as you don’t get pvp rewards (which are also incredibly strong in pvp) by means of rank ups through honorable kills.
---
World pvp is as bad as it is because it’s necessary to grind honor for those who need certain ranks. Bgs will relieve the gank squads a bit, but world pvp will still be something that the most dedicated do whenever they have downtime or waiting in long queues with their premise.
---
It’s an awful system that rewards incredibly unhealthy habits and the prestige of it has really worn off since classic launched imo. There’s a reason they moved to arena rating for gear in tbc.
---
No. It's the 2019 gamer playing a 2004 game. This game was meant to chill and be immersive. Not this
---
Huh? The strongest dueling classes are SL lock, spriest and rogue.
---
You spelled boomkin tank wrong
---
I'm just thinking how my matchups go against a Mage or Rogue.
---
I die.
---
They probably will add it, and it will be catastrophic.  Paid transfers are the reason WoW has played out as it did.  Paid Transfers led to the quicker rise of mega servers.  Paid Transfers (and faction changes) are the reason something like 90% of the top guild in the world are all horde.  The massive faction imbalance is what led to the move to warmode which is something people bitch about being terrible.
---
Would these things have happened normally?  Most likely.  It also made it happen faster.  The existence of transfers also made people want to go to mega servers to avoid getting stuck on dead servers.  It led people to the exact same mindset going into classic.  It's why people would rather wait through longer queues than go somewhere else.
---
I am sure they will introduce paid transfers because they want the money.  Paid transfers are also probably the single worst thing these ever did for people who hate what retail has become.
---
Nope, you can however go past him with a hunter or rogue or heck any class as long as they are willing to die.
---
You pull him towards the left side whilst your party goes along the right side and immediately turn right again and wait there (they don't aggro the gordok captain this way)
---
Then the guy with kromcrush moves to the right aswell and dies just around the corner (having kromcrush in the doorway where he normally stands). He then gets ressed and you can continue your way.
---
Or you use lesser invis pots x5 :)

This website is absolutely fake with numbers.

I checked the last 7 days for level 60 Horde on my server Herod and it said 4855 60's.  On Faerlina it said they only had 1372 level 60's on for the last 7 days.  
---
Knowing that Faerlina is much more populated than Herod... this is a very false stat.
---
I'm so confused by this comment. For one, yes, "Hype" has been used as a verb for a long ass time. Second, OP didn't even use it as a verb...they used it as an adjective
---
I hope it happens to more servers. The only solution is faction queues - not implementing it just means the minority gets bored and leaves/unsubs and the majority mob goes to fuck over somewhere else. The longer the delay until faction queues are implemented, the worse the dmg will be.
---
Yeah, our biggest improvement week to week has absolutely been DPS.  Our first few weeks we only had a handful of people parsing above 50%.  Last week literally every DPS parsed 60% or higher except maybe the winters chill bitch and 2 of our warlocks who are still a work in progressl. Almost every melee parsed 70% or higher, with several of them approaching 90%.  Raidwide DPS has gone from ~7.5k to roughly ~15k, with peaks sometimes at ~21k.  We've been working with a lot of them to get hit cap, encouraging groups to farm e'ko, giving incentives to show up with full consumes.  We still have a few people who are still not there yet, but we've made it pretty clear our guild is seeking to improve and become better not only as a whole, but individually as well.
---
Other things I would check is seeking your debuff uptimes for CoE, CoS, and CoR on bosses.  We discovered one of our warlocks was performing fairly poorly on CoR uptimes and have been working with them to improve on that.  Other than that it's all about execution.  Looking through the logs and finding out where you can improve.  Where people are taking needless damage.  Where dispells are a bit too slow.  One thing I recommend and that we have started doing is regular fire pots for the lava packs.  That shit saves lives, they are only like 6g/stack.  We went from having like 2-3 people die every lava pack to virtually 0 deaths.
---
i like how all these people are arguing with you for this comment lmao. 
---
its is 100% a guild effort to build this weapon, and its a status symbol for the entire guild.
---
I used gbank fund to buy Ingots and we all chipped in with arcanite bars
---
Well yea, im already in BRD, but takes group 60-80 minutes to get there, by the time everyone is there someone else has left
---
You wrote out an inaccurate source as a source.
---
The dps check for him was being able to kill Rag in one phase. We just got a 1 minute 29sec kill with only 35 people. He will. It wall anyone. And we’re by far not a top guild. Bwl will face melt and people will start speed clearing week 2
---
Fuck yeah rasin brand
---
Looks like he wearing feral gear
---
BASED AND REDPILLED
---
We get it, you smoke weed
---
BABY WAAA  
---
go run away wuss allys instead of facing ur challenges head on
---
Just gonna point it out in case other readers missed it; it's an alliance only quest.
---
Wait until paid server transfers become a thing
---
Thank you for this!
---
Agreed, I was jumped by a Tauren Druid and an undead priest last night after no provocation. They mercilessly camped my body.  went on for over an hour. 
---
It's those encounters that make me want to gank when I get to a higher lvl.
---
Im on herod alliance and i would say horde are camping AH/Bank in IF 24/7.  Ive yet to not see at least 4-5 of them actively killing anyone with a pvp flag inside IF.  At 5am on a weekday i had to get up early for week and checked AH and they were active.  Its pretty crazy how committed these people are.
---
No one directly answered my second question but I think i got the answer based off of how pvp ranks are determined. So the remaining alliance on flamelash wont actually rank up faster since the brackets are based on percentile the brackets will just be smaller

---
Yes crystal spire does not stack rip
---
That's what you did, yeah. It worked almost every time.
---
thanks for the reply
---
I came here to ask the same thing. What is wrong with AtlasLoot?
---
Iirc, there are two AtlasLoot addons. I use the smaller one which just has loot tables. I'm not sure what other features the larger addon has.
---
I think the one I use is called Atlas Loot Tables.
---
Nah, fury prot TPS is far higher than bear w/ mcp. Bears have a somewhat acceptable TPS when using it, but it's still not high enough to hold threat off a fully buffed warrior, even if the bear also has the same buffs.
---
Yeah that's whack lol
---
Remember, remember, the Fifth of December.
---
You should not get brut blade over rogues. You should not have rolled on the viskag unless there were no rogues and no nonorc warriors in raid. 
---
I think you should learn the loot priority before you do another raid, you don't even really want brut right now. Either just go flurry or get CHT.
---
Pretty sure NE's are the nazis of wow.  Tyrande was all about purging the other races in warcraft3.
---
With 2 deathbringers you're functionally doing similar or more burst outside aoe - I still remember those absurd moments with 2x crusader, enrage and deathwish. Anything targetted just fell over.
---
Elemental mastery+nature's swiftness, you can do 3000-4000 dmg with 1.5 sec cast OR ~2500 instant cast
---
What?
---
Another guy did mentioned it but this definitely sounds like the best option to go.
---
Release the hounds
---
Im an orc using Axe of the Deep Woods and Flurry Axe. I can put in Truestriker Shoulders. But I’ll be over the hitcap especially with LH.
---
No but it hurts your boyfriend's cock
---
take the 1 hour elixir buffs, greater fire potions, rumsey rums
---
and try to get DM / Ony buff
---
Clip is accurate, enemy faction engages when they have an advantage.
---
I’m a Mage.  I told the main tank in my guild that I’m getting Thunderfury.  He was mildly amused.
---
Correct. It's impossible to hit rank 14 in fewer than 12 weeks regardless of how many people are on your server, for instance.
---
Interesting, that's good to know. It seems like win or lose for an av zerg, the honor is wild
---
I tank in 31/0/20 so I can stance dance at will and activate berserker rage off cooldown. This spec is good for 5 mans, pvp, and offtanking in raids.
---
This actually proves the Horde was always and will always be superior to alliance.
---
The fact alliance are quitting the game permanently proves the old adage of 'alliance are babies'
---
In H1Z1 there was a native keybind to change draw distance. The default draw distance was 1500, but most players would quickly swap it to 500 for maximum fps when fighting close range. If you wanted to scout you could change it to 4000.
---
What if I'm asian?
---
Paladins get it rough from those 2 classes
---
Literally just search the name of the boss on classic.db and scroll down...
---
It has tier sets, professions, pvp gear, rep rewards and stuff like that.
---
You're going to have to imagine it from now on.
---
Yup, Google Sheets
---
Hey man, thanks a lot! You have already taken care of the most important stuff with OeB and 6% hit, now just get as much AP and Crit as you can, no real goals other than getting whatever is the best gear available to you at this point.
---
2h is totally optional. I just like it for threat generation and to make things go quicker. If you’re not having issues keeping aggro, then I wouldn’t sweat it.
---
&gt;My server is worse balanced so you don't get to complain about being outnumbered.
---
&gt; so why are you building it as a guild?
---
&gt; so 2 people can feel good about their item?
---
yes.
---
Literally just search the name of the boss on classic.db and scroll down..
---
Absolute legend.
---
For pvp they've got great stats.  
---
My pve-set is completely different :)
---
Thats not a bad idea, especially around 50s! I might just “trade” the Kang for something like flurry or another good 1h
---
Yeah I'm sure all the premades queuing for WSG looking at 30+ minute queues will just chill in UC or Org and not go camp the Plaguelands or hearth to Kargath while they wait.
---
You dudes and your female characters.
---
I just checked ,and it gave approx 5k 60s on faerlina.
---
And just because a server might be popular doesn't mean that it has the most 60s.
---
I also never said the site was 100% accurate, none of the census sites are. But they do give decent estimates, and Blizzard made them worse they because they tried to break the census addons. (which recovered somewhat apparently, but people have put in some effort now)
---
I knew the 12 week minimum part, I more meant would you still need to spam bgs 16 hours a day for rank 14 on a server like that. Or would you be able to reduce that to say 12hours a day since your faction hardly has anyone on it?
---
Do it.
---
I’ve bin trying to snag “Randy” on my server since release.
---
Exactly, it all stems from the increased player caps.
---
MY ANACONDA DONT WANT NONE UNLESS ITS A DWARVEN RIVER DANCE
---
You're leaving out the part where horde outnumbers alliance on world bosses by an insane margin, way more than 60/40.
---
PVP servers outnumber PVE by a huge margin, and effectively every full pop server that still has a queue is PVP. Enjoy your 20 minute queues.
---
I’m a shaman so I want hand of rag.
---
Trust that I will probably end up farming and using TuF for most of classic lol
---
Players made servers 70:30, not blizzard.
---
So are dudes who play female characters.
---
No no. I don't have a list of the bosses. My proposal lists the bosses in the behavior of the AtlasLoot.
---
Stalagg is fun right now
---
I'm not a druid, but have been looking for a wardrobe addon that works. Do you have any recommendations?
---
Yeah you get 2 extra weaponskill to both your MH axe and OH dagger, which makes it better.
---
Haha so glad I got while the gettin was good
---
Was this supposed to be funny or something?
---
I am at work and away from the game. Love AtlasLoot. Let's make it into a simple website.
---
I dont understand how people can play without it tbh. I have friends who are really good at the game and hate using it and I dont get it
---
 I am at work and away from the game. Love AtlasLoot. Let's make it into a simple website.
---
Huh.
---
My last parse experimenting it really didn't convince me that it increased my overall crit. And while this post doesn't, I guess I'll have to test again.
---
&gt;The 5th of December is the day my life fell apart.
---
*Remember, remember, the 5th of ~~November~~ December, 
---
The gunpowder, treason, and plot. 
---
I see no reason why the 5th of ~~November~~ December,
---
Should ever be forgot.*
---
Yeah they did stupid stuff but griefing horde players are just as much to blame. People can live with unbalance, locking down the entire world? What do people think they would do?
---
Reflected bitch!
---
From what I've seen other people says, BGs are most likely across realms. Meaning that PvE realms might be grouped with PvP realms.
---
Those are all valid concerns, and I will be improving the guide alongside similar guidelines in the future. Stuff like playing loot council for guilds is best left to them, though. If a gear piece is good for warriors, it makes no sense to exclude it from a general BIS list because, in an ideal world, Rogues benefit more as they lack heroic strike. Those decisions are up to each guild, and in my own guild (eHeroes Gehennas) these items have primarily went to DPS Warriors, in fact. Not 100% optimal, but they absolutely deserved them in face of their dedication thus far. 
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Increased server caps was a change that should have never happened.
---
Only have a lvl15 druid myself but I believe a decently popular spec is 0/30/21, getting Heart of the Wild but dropping Leader of the Pack for Nature's Swiftness. This build will let you heal or tank well through leveling and 5 man content but don't expect to raid with it. Certainly your cat DPS will suffer.
---
Yep. Nothing is fresh. Shit. This stuff is all 15 years old. It’s... insanely solved. There isn’t a speck of classic wow that is an unknown. Especially with pservers also running the last 15 years.
---
The idea would be to rotate so each player gets GM
---
faction queues and letting majority leave is the entire fucking point bud
---
This is my server doofus
---
It's permanent, and occurs sporadically every few days.
---
I mean, let's me honest. Any bit of critical thinking and you should probably know it's not permanent.
---
Ice barrier and blast wave or ice barrier and pom in the same build would be really nice in pvp as mage.
---
Getting chased by zugzugs? Equip this trinket and die before they touch you! Woohooo!
---
Most planned MTs and OTs are taurens or trolls (for threat)
---
This makes it so the weapon skill you are talking about isn’t quite so there.
---
However if you are an orc, I would question if the 8 dps loss and the slower speed would be worth it.
---
Sulfuras has a GREAT ratio of alliance to horde
---
It all depends on the rest of your faction on your server and their individual play times, can't answer that question.
---
we still haven't had either of those drops. Got the eye before either of them lol
---
There is a lvl 2 horde character that usually shows up in BRM and Felwood right before the Alliance raids come through on Stalagg. Not sure if there is a spy in this vid, but I know one exists on Stalagg....
---
People did not widely call for faction queues at any point until it was already beyond repair. 
---
What people here were in fact doing is relentlessly fearmongering dead servers , mocking people who transferred to medium servers, and suggesting no one would accomplish anything if they weren't willing to sit in queue for half a day.
---
A vocal handful of assclowns who largely equate self-worth with WoW accomplishments were experiencing cognitive dissonance and had to loudly convince themselves of what they were doing. 
---
The result was a community that overwhelmingly favored mega PvP servers to its detriment.
---
Lol i think the point is one takes 60ish hours and  a hundred or so gold whereas the other takes 9000+ gold on my server and a lucky drop
---
Weren't they under the command of the Defias who were planning to overthrow the kingdom?
---
Well, it's certainly preferable because the boss curses everyone in the raid every 10-15 seconds (so up to ~200 curses per minute), so if you want your mages/druids to actually be able to do damage/healing, you don't want them to spend all their time spamming decurses.
---
This town is comin’ like a ghost town
---
All of the guilds have shut down
---
Allies don’t wanna play no more
---
Too much ganking inside of Ironforge
---
Doing this quest as a shaman or priest is great. 
---
Gnome warlock and I are buffed, waiting for taelan to spawn.
---
He /nos me
---
I /no him
---
He laughs
---
yells O K B O O M E R
---
I purge him. 
---
4 guards swarm and massacre this poor guy.
---
Ok, zoomer.
---
I saw him again as taelan was fighting the last mob. Purged him again and the high inquis immediately turned and two tapped him.
---
But it went from something that was at least playable, to a wasteland.
---
Same. 100 or 10 are still not valid choices for the number of stacks.
---
Never played Vanilla. Leveled a Warrior as my first character in Classic. I have no frame of reference, but it was fine — Tedious, and sometimes frustrating, but fine. The only clues that I got as to the famous difficulty of leveling a Warrior were that yellow quests usually felt pretty difficult for me, and pulling two mobs was dangerous until high levels, which don’t seem to be the case for some other classes.
---
It's weird seeing Lv55+ people using trash trinkets when you can get this one at Lv39.  It's so fucking good for melee.
---
This is a personal preference you really only can answer yourself. You're much aware of the benefits. You decide if it is worth the extra cash :)
---
Y O U  D E F E A T E D
---
I'm on Grobbulus, and people are constantly crying about "Wah, people complaining about PVP on a RP-PVP server, wah" but really we're not the crybabies, it's the people crying about us. All I'm doing is reporting when I get ganked. Not to blizzard, just to the defense chat. It's not a complaint to point out shitty people.
---
"Well they aren't shitty, aren't they just playing the game the way its supposed to be played." by one shotting low levels left and right for limited honor? Just for the kicks of ruining the fun of other people? Yes, PVP server make it possible. But in my opinion, doing the right thing when your faced to doesn't make you a good person. What makes you a good person is doing the right thing even when you could not do the right thing. People I come across who are reasonable and friendly despite having every reason not to be, those are people to look up to, and that's what seperate a decent human being from a dick wad.
---
If I come across someone a lower level than me, I will leave them alone unless they're causing trouble, ganking lower levels, or attacking alliance NPCs.
---
Even better than I remember it for the most part. A PvP realm with a fixed population (aka no layers, cross server pop, etc), makes everything from Mining ore to traveling, etc so much more...personal. I see the same people day in and day out. Whether it be the alliance competition farming thorium (had some seriously good pvp battles), or the groups protecting BRM (both in the form of being thankful of usual groups that hold it for my own faction, as well as forming groups to survive/take it form alliance).
---
The absolute volume of people have made the largest difference between vanilla and classic. It has made the economy and PvP scene much different than back in the day. Overall, though, I am super glad I left Faerlina for Grobbulus (Fuck those queues, left early at about level 30). Hit 60 about a month ago and I've been loving it so far.
---
Cerebral cortex compound. It stacks with mage buff
---
Stop it, that's just cringe to read. There is no "going too far" by basically playing the game. They're not cheating or doing anything unfair, the only thing unbalanced are the servers and the honor system. Blame blizzard, not players
---
I tend to heal in raids more than I tank, and in healing gear my mana pool is close to either 5k or 6k (can't remember which).  Sitting around 400 spellpower.
---
Maybe i'd make the switch to downranked regrowths.
---
I didnt install it, feels kinda like cheating, MC is easy enough as it is without some program telling you what to do.
---
I'm confused? There is no guild called Zandalar Tribe in the photo?
---
Can't go see Frozen on a non raid night?
---
Nah, the only way to fix this is to institute faction queues when the total online pop exceeds a faction threshold/total pop threshold , and allow faction flipping from the dominant to minority faction.  But I doubt if Blizz would do something as "out there" as this.
---
Server merges won't work because the total PVP Horde population across all servers is so much greater than alliance... there aren't enough alliance heavy PVP servers to make it work.
---
DKP rewards time, not effort. You don't get extra DKP based on the damage meters, usually. 
---
&gt; it is entirely unfair in a raid of 40 people to win a roll that you would never have had without the whole group.
---
Not sure what you're trying to say here. Only one person out of 40 wins the item no matter what system you're using, not unique to rolls.
---
Some people pick the strangest hills to die on
---
Thanks. Been a very long time since I’ve done them.
---
I havenot seen frozen2, but its probably worth it to watch frozen 1 before. Or watch the first 30 min so you know the characters names and read the synopsis.
---
Have fun at the movies, there will be more mcs to come!
---
Baboon
---
Quick question since my situation is pretty similar. I have FlameGuard for hands, with OEB. I have LHH/TS/Bloodmail Boots/Hit XBow/Ony Neck/Rune Guard/Blackstone ring all available for my hit pieces, wondering what pieces are going to be the greatest upgrade.  
---
I've thought about 3/4 Dragon Scale for the 2% crit and then getting riphook (i think thats AP bow). Still grinding for HoJ so just wondering what the ideal raiding hit pieces are going to be. I figure its probably LHH/Ony Neck/Onslaught/Rings but I'm pretty far back in DKP for Onslaught.
---
If you're melee bring agi pots or mongoose, flasks aren't necessary but in general a player can do the bare minimum to help the raid.  A free action pot for gehennas and a restorative pot for lucifron if you really want to.
---
Yes. Until Blizzard does something about it. Who knows, maybe your server is next?
---
It takes a special variety of shithead to gank not only in Moonglade, but someone fishing in MG.
---
Yep it reminds me of a vanilla realm fairly balanced.
---
In what world are they handling more players lmao.
---
I loved Nost but the playerbase was miniscule compared to the number of players currently on Classic WoW. WoWPop has recorded almost 10,000,000 characters created, with almost 600,000 currently active players.
---
That's LUDICROUSLY more than Nostalrius. Ludicrously more.
---
/r/iamverybadass
---
Well alliance because I wanted to make a pink haired female gnome.
---
Server type?  I hate wpvp.  As for the specific server, i picked one that was in my time zone and didn't have a streamer on it.  Fortunately i ended up pagle which has a massive alliance pop :P
---
Horde: "lul PvP happened"
---
*It hurt itself in confusion*
---
Sure! Ubrs especially. If the other healer is geared it should be fine!
---
Scholo might get tough.
---
Do you want a fair fight or a fight your side either automatically wins or automatically loses regardless of player actions? Cause that is what it is today for a significant amount. I want servers to be contestable, I don't want a steamroll. This change was allowed and as a consequence now many servers are steamrolled.
---
&gt;I've always wondered what it would be like to live the simple life of a shopkeeper, buying the hero's many rusty daggers
---
The JRPG Dragon Quest IV has a chapter that starts off literally like this, where you play a shopkeeper in a weapon/armor shop, buying stuff from or selling stuff to the patrons that periodically stop by.
---
You can play this role as long or short as you like, as it's not actually needed to beat the chapter. There is also a rare chance for someone to sell you an OP sword that you can then buy from your own store
---
But how do I know that?
---
You're right, I misread.
---
Counter-argument though; The Orcs hadn't lost their demonic fueled blood rage at the time when Grom chops trees in Ashenvale, as King_Seabear suggests. 
---
In the previous mission Grom litterally says "I can wait no longer. The humans must be slaughtered!" and defies Thralls orders as seen in the mission Cry of the Warsong. 
---
In the interlude The Blood of Mannoroth Tichondrius points out that " The blood pact that you made with the orcs long ago still binds them to you." 
---
So to say that "The Orcs severed their ties to demons and lost the blood rage." at the time of Groms fighting in Ashenvale is a bit... false, aint it?
---
Sure, the Blood rage was weaker than when the Orcs first drank the blood and subsequently invaded Azeroth, but it was still there and it still worked, as Grom exemplefies.
---
What’s the best add on for checking and tracking raid buffs/consumables?  For instance- seeing which players have fire protection potions or elixirs up, seeing who has used thistle tea, etc.
---
Yes, as well as gouge.  Maybe repentance also since it's an incap?
---
the rumor on incendius is that we are alliance heavy 55/45, dont know how accurate community generated data is though
---
I've had a second account from at least bc. If you aren't worried about  second sub.  They are great for all those reasons plus.  Extra mule toons, profs, CD.  
---
I love flying to a random spot and doing my auctions during that time.  Also having it parked in the city and see what's going on.  Ie deals, groups...whatever.
---
We've been doing this as a whole guild the past few weeks. Always funny to see who misses the jump and gets splatted.
---
Do you find that the Bear + Charge macro takes multiple presses?  When I try it seems like furor takes half a second to actually give me the rage so the charge fails saying not enough rage.
---
Bad idea posting it on reddit now blizzard is gonna fix it
---
LOL Very good.
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen someone say, "No, upgrading revenge and sunder does not increase their threat, and this is why many warriors don't get them to save money..." so it's good that you mention that as it's good information to have.
---
Just checked again for 60's only for the last 7 days and it is telling me 1372 on Faerlina.  You are positive you have everything exactly like me for the website?
---
Why shouldn't they? The game is all about the two factions battling it out. The only difference is this time one side actually won because Blizzard once again is proving that it is incompetent.
---
this is why i love playing a hunter. Playing a warrior is painfulll in PvP after maining a hunter for so long
---
I think lorewise, they wouldn't have been accepted into the Horde (Thrall didn't want them afaik), if not for the tauren, who took mercy on them and wanted to research and cure their condition. This is in classic though, and undead quests (especially Apothecary) are still pretty evil. What happened later, in Wrath and BfA pretty much seals the deal - yeah, we're evil I guess. Small price to pay for being the coolest looking.
---
NPC = "Non-Player Character"
---
Good God, man! Are you just TRYING to rip a hole in space-time or something??
---
You're either willfully missing my point or really fucking stupid. Either way I'm done with ya.
---
Its 3 horde players for every 2 alliance. That isn’t a huge difference
---
Fray 60 warrior here. 
---
What are some things I can do solo that will immediately help me with tanking, dps and pvp.
---
I’ve farmed devilsaur for set, am awaiting AV for some exalted gear and will soon level engineering. I’m also mining and have 4 arcane crystals, hoping to farm more. 
---
I’m looking for quest chains for gear, stuff I CANT skip or some tips on other things to farm.
---
Appreciate any insight.
---
I'm not an expert but I just use max rank HT and Rank 4 HT. Max rank rejuv on tank if he's taking damage. Save regrowth for emergencies since it drains your Mana fast.
---
For proper continuity of story, you should definitely watch Frozen 1 otherwise you will lack critical context.
---
You needed full on spreadsheets to track resources to be a server-capped weaponsmith in SWG, it was crazy
---
In low level dungeons the shaman is superior. The damage is a non issue, so is threat. You don't need to build up aggro since earthshock exists.
---
In fact most shamans are taking even less damage than the warriors since the shaman tank can just use a 1h shield combo and the warriors are 2h tanking most of the time.
---
Is there any dungeon a shaman is too soft for?
---
Playing on Atiesh (PvE) as a more casual player for a change compared to my original experience.  Just got 60 yesterday after relying on a lot of rested experience and BRD/LBRS run to grind from 52-60.
---
Community on Atiesh is fantastic - lots of friendly people both in my guild and outside and the server is very active on Alliance side.
---
I’m very impatient for ZG/BWL since those are my two favorite raids but oh well, I still need to start raiding MC I guess.
---
Blizzard made the game such that that's how people distribute themselves; players are just behaving as the game incentivizes. That's the world of warcraft that you play.
---
Carry invisibility potions on you
---
Nope.  They won’t even be able to get past rank 9 at this point
---
In this tier of raiding our guild has started allowing PVP specs for DPS. Seems to be working fine and we figure it'll let respec costs stay low until BWL. Still doing Ony/MC clear in ~2.5 hours. I tried the slam macro last week and it seemed to work pretty well. Obviously the parses aren't as good but the current content isn't hard.
---
It akways looks much more impressive on videos than screenshots
---
I've taken screenshots of overcrowded onyxia buffs and pvp at phase 2 release but it looked 1% as impressive as it really was in game
---
People give stuff to streamers and think the streamer owes them something in return KEKW
---
To clarify for readers — Crits do not generate special extra threat because they’re crits, but do more threat because the extra damage generates 1 threat per point of damage, as all damage does.
---
I never understood the premades for BGs. Not that I hate it, but rather, when you notice you are about to go with a PUG against a premade in a BG, why does no one want to plan? You know you are about to lose without a plan, but people still take off and do their own thing while the other side just steamrolls.
---
MMORPG= mostly men online role playing girls
---
Lets hope you've never asked a question before.
---
PvE server gang
---
Mage here. Forget winters chill since most mages have it and spec into clearcasting
---
What server did you end up choosing? A friend of mine who’s never online convinced me to do rattlegore, but I’d rather play alliance and want to refill on a good pve server.
---
Horde can bypass most alliance defences by going tgrough the backdoor straight to vann- although i dont expect people to do that on this server
---
All I ask is to not be 5v1 and 10 v1 all the time.  And it's getting annoying to be followed out of a neutral town like everlook or gadget by people trying to hunt you down.  Those parts are really annoying and the 5 rogues in one area.  I see one then suddenly theres the rest.
---
&gt; Their slogan is if you don't stand with us, you stand against us.
---
I think it's a reasonable slogan if you're living through the ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.
---
What’s haste? No a native
---
There's an addon called gathermate which allows you to import map data marking all herb and mining nodes on your map (world and mini). It only shows where things can spawn and you have to get close to see if they are there, but you can import both mining and herb nodes and then the sense herb/ore thing isnt as critical
---
Thunder Clap &gt; Demo &gt; Battle Shout is probably the best way to open multi-target pulls. TC does surprisingly high threat because it does generates special threat (like Sunder) that isn’t mentioned in the tooltip.
---
104 threat on four targets (130 minus the 20% Battle Stance penalty) is among the best threat you can get for one button press. Demo helps with mitigation and gives you 43 more threat to pad your lead a small amount more. Battle Shout is important to keep up and also generates pretty good threat if your whole party is in combat with the mobs, which they should be after your first two globals. Throw a sunder on your main target somewhere in there if you feel like you’re losing aggro during your opening three globals.

I wonder how many people are oblivious to the AV base trade meta
---
ttv btw

As an alliance player on Flamelash I feel like I was forced to make a decision.. Staying on Flamelash would be my preference, yeah it sucks getting pvped all the time in any zone I go to, but I've made friends here and I know most of the guilds on the server. In that sense I DO feel like I'm giving up this long term connection with the server for a short term enjoyable experience on a new server. Who knows what this new server will look like in a week, a month, or a year?
---
But what choice do I have as a player when multiple big guilds decide to transfer, and then my own guild decides to transfer a few days later? Once the ball got rolling, it was over for Flamelash. As an individual, I felt powerless, like my only real choice was to contribute to the problem or be left behind. 
---
I probably shouldn't, but I take it pretty personally when you "wish people would actually think things through for once", because we clearly did think it through, else we would've transferred the first time it was made available. We've known of the server imbalance for months. We told people in our guild to stick it out till the 10th, where the release of Battlegrounds would likely reduce the amount of unfair world-pvp we had to endure. 
---
I don't hold it against the Horde either. Sure, those players camping flight points or graveyards can go fuck themselves, but they're playing the game that Blizzard gave them. Killing = honor, and why hunt for players across a whole map when there's a steady supply of players coming in every minute at the flight point? I get it, it sucks but I do get it. I just hope my own faction doesn't do the same to the horde when we outnumber them on the new server, but I know better than to expect such a miracle. 
---
Blizzard are the ones who shoul've thinked things through for once! How could they not see this happening? Why would they close free server transfers on a server with a "problematic" A/H ratio a mere week before the release of a possible fix, namely Battlegrounds? It frustrates me to no end that now we're "cowards", we "don't think things through", we "mess up another server", when we just felt completely screwed on our own server.
---
I have played WoW for much of my life since vanilla. And this is a far cry from how I remember vanilla. We were all shit at the game then, info was hard to come by and you pvp for resources or for the sake of it; not because you knew of the super strong blue sets.
---
Needing to man up on 60/40.. I really think you should go ahead and help out on the 40th percentile yourself. Might open your eyes a bit.
---
or maybe they don't have time for griefing??
---
If we're going to play this game then all of Azeroth is Old God lands.
---
How do you accidentally type 60 instead of 6 when 6 and 0 are nowhere near each other? I told him the stack price, he replied with the unit price, then started asking about stacks again
---
Yeah dire maul is almost always Alli controlled, takes at least 10 deaths to make it in
---
I like this comment very much, for the way you handled yourself after earlier comments. More people should do this type of introspection.
---
Not true at all. The last census a full month or so in showed near even faction lines.
---
Here's youtube vid explaining some of this stuff (on pservers though I believe so take it with a grain of salt). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU\_Jf4eyZTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU_Jf4eyZTI)

G o T o RE T a IL
---
I did all 4 yesterday and there’s truly honour among hunters.
---
Plenty of hunters from opposite faction spared me when I was In compromised situation doing the quest.
---
2 other hunters did the winterspring one, so I chilled back and helped clear mobs for them. They both failed. So they /pointed and /cheer me to go at it. And when I killed it they clapped for me.
---
Felt like a great break from phase 2.
---
The Ship of Theseus has, over the years, become the Space Battleship Yamato.
---
TC generates 130 threat (104 after 20% battle stance penalty) on top of its damage. It’s strong multi-target threat.
---
He should have had you- these mages not casting AM
---
Yes, yes, I'm sure that you're one of the good ones or whatever.
---
Yeah, nvm. I didn't select faction.
---
It has 1372 lvl 60 hordes, and 3k lvl 60 alliance. But I don't know anything about that server, besides it being an influence server.
---
And Asmongold is playing there, so it being more alliance heavy might be the case.
---
While this site states that horde is in the majority at lvl 60.
---
I have no idea which site is accurate, or if any of them are. But I know the census sites requires people to voluntarily upvote their data gathered, so the more people are using the addon and uploading the more accurate they will become
---
Do the tiron fordring questline. Will get you a good neck that will carry you until you can get head of onxyia
---
People were shouting #NoChanges not realizing we live in a different time. And almost like a cruel joke Blizzard said  “Ok, No changes it is you idiots.”
---
And i bet you wonder why alliance re fleeing PvP server.
---
Not just the good guys.  They are so much more.
---
They all chose to stay to get easy rank 14.
---
I rolled horde for the undead. Thought it would be a cool race and kinda neat to play a zombie-type character
---
It was on the character select screen...
---
&gt; How do you accidentally type 60 instead of 6 when 6 and 0 are nowhere near each other? 
---
Are you asking US how YOU accidentally typed 60 instead of 6?
---
What is going on in this thread?!!?
---
And the Warsong Lumberjacks just want to chop the wood they need to build and maintain their homes.
---
I think they should just change the way the honor system works, it is the disease. Camping FP's, Camping GY's, camping corpses, crazy raids everywhere ganking you on the way to BRM, all of those are just symptoms of the real problem, which is that the honor system is garbage.
---
The only player I can think of where you can claim anything remotely close to an outlandish 90% recognition rate would be Leroy Jenkins, is it them?
---
hey I said 'roleplay AS an NPC', not 'be an NPC'
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=eu&amp;filter=true
---
This may or may not be entirely accurate, but its an estimate.
---
If you gotta stare at an ass all day it may as well be female.
---
Can confirm this, took me a solid 15mins to inch my way through Dire Maul. But Horde tends to control BRM during my raid time
---
There's more to the story behind a faction imbalance behind just the numbers.  Are people who are griefed 24/7 because they're outnumbered more likely to transfer off?  Yes, absolutely.  Not seeing that part of the argument is disingenuous at best.  There's no salt, I don't even play on this server.
---
You need 300 people on your server to hit rank 14 so its impossible
---
r/ihadastroke
---
It went from bustling hellscape to dead hellscape, bad enough.
---
Dissapointed I didn't level to 60 sooner (think it took me 4-5 weeks), and that no weapons drop from our MC raids while having 11 warriors at times.  The guild I tried to build and have all the oldschool players from Vanilla Gilneas worked until the people who no-lifed to 60 left to raid.  Kind of disheartening but we ended up merging and have been raiding now for 3 weeks, it's ok, MC is as boring as you'd always remember but the people make it all worth it.
---
Eh, +15 Enchanting isn't *that* great.
---
DBM ,Big Wigs or GTFO?
---
One of the best things about being a fire mage is that most people made a frost reflector, but not a fire one. This warlock is not most people though!
---
Do you sell BoEs on AH? I usually vendor greens except shadow, frozen wrath and eagle, so that could be part of it. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Fuck me for sharing honestly what I get from ZF without conflating the numbers, right?
---
My bet, it doesn't release on the 10th, ends up slightly later, Blizz says we misread the announcement.
---
If your server has less than 167 active players (or 333, depending on how the rounding works), nobody will ever reach rank 14.
---
Get a weapon chain and grind all the enemies in the valley just north of the Kodo Graveyard until 42 or 43.
---
Basilisk cave in STV is nice 42 through 45.
---
&gt;(who almost always had that one hairstyle with the long hair and ponytail, with that one specific smooth face and the smallest tusks)

God damn this is too real.
---
There's at least 10 women in my guild, 3 of us officers out of 10 officers total.  Obviously the majority of members of the guild are men, and a couple of those women are dating/married to someone (a couple met on vanilla WoW for example), but the rest just play on their own.  For example, my boyfriend doesn't even like to play video games.  We have a core raid group of 40 plus a bunch of other members still leveling and such, so it's basically 1/4th women overall when it comes to the raid group.  I've also met quite a lot of other women while doing pugs, and I'm sure many others who I didn't know were women.  Also the main PvP raid leader on my server that PvPs hardcore and always gets people together in city chat and directs the attacks every single day is a woman.  In my opinion/experience, lots of women play Classic.
---
Medivh warned Thrall about how shit was about to hit the fan and that to save his people they needed to sail to Kalimdor. Thrall took him seriously whereas the humans did not.
---
I was quite concerned with server stability when my server became unbalanced and continued to get worse. I decided rather than risk it continuing to get worse, I rerolled to a bigger server that was more balanced
---
Every time I hear this argument, I guess the person presenting it just assumes everyone is here to min/max and that there are no new players joining the game ever?
---
What about the first time players who decided to play, or people who play for reasons other than the best gear possible? They will not be searching the forums to see how things were 15 years ago. 
---
The game needs to be playable for those people, as they are paying for it, perrrriodddd.
---
Incendius is awesome, feel so lucky I picked it when I read all of these horror stories. No one faction is ever in control of anything for long. Even though it's not 50/50 it still works because the numbers of people pvp'ing are roughly even most of the time it seems.
---
Shoulda coulda woulda, I also could of done things to stop it from getting that close
---
Okinawa?
---
I play horde here, lots of players and guilds available. However, there are more alliance but since its PvE, that doesnt matter.
---
That's part of what makes classic great.  You don't have this forced dichotomy of pre-level cap and post-level cap.  Hypnotic blade is another level 30 item that casters can pick up that lasts them all the way to 60.
---
1. I whisper stack price
---
2. He replies with unit price 
---
3. He starts asking about stacks but I assumed he was still talking about units
---
4. I type 60 instead of 6 because of that
---
What nades are you using? Iron grenades have an increased chance to be resisted by targets over lvl 50.
---
DPS it is, thanks.
---
Pretty certain it's using post 1.12, judging by bracket sizes on our server.
---
"Of course it will, it lasted longer on private severs! "
---
Lol... because Blizzard will do like the private servers?  What are you smoking and can I buy some?
---
I never played what you refer to as "retail" I only played vanilla back when that was a thing.
---
"and leave classic to those wanting to play only classic."
---
It's still classic if they release BWL or whatever.
---
So many aspects of classic isn't similar to vanilla anyway. 
---
what could possibly make you think they will manage to stretch out the little content there is for 2-3 years just so that a few casual players can feel privileged?
---
I think the whole thing will be released in around 1-1½ years from now, tops.
---
People are flying through it and they will lose non-casual players if they don't adhere.
---
Casuals will again just be casual and enjoy the game for what it is and still play it even though some instances are released a bit sooner.
---
Why don't you join a casual guild btw?  I don't see the problem with that.  Even my guild which performs well on logs and speedruns etc. still have casuals that will clear Molten Core, non-casuals will join for DKP.
---
I'm Flamelash Horde but am genuinely rooting for &lt;Leftovers&gt;.
---
Except they showed up at the same time and failed miserably, so more like the French holding out in Canada (ironforge)
---
Same a trap macro, just replace trap with shadow meld.
---
First press cast FD, second shadowmeld.

San Clemente
---
If it is on disney plus, you could watch frozen 1 there and get a couple weeks of the Mandalorian.  I would watch frozen 1 until you know what is going to happen in the very lineal style that Disney does.  Then perhaps skip to the end.  It is only 102 minutes long.  You should skip the first night of MC, and say you will be there for domo and Rag clean up on Sunday.  If it is the first time, most people won't have the aqual needed for douses.
---
How exactly does SL help you when the druid outranges you? Last time I checked it didn't give me movement speed.
---
Love the effort, particularly the shoulder. 🤣
---
Just because you gank an easy target for honor doesn't make you less skillful. The system is what it is.
---
So is it still pathetic if Ally control the area?
---
He does not have 3% wasted hit, lol. Hit does not become a useless stat after u reach the soft cap.
---
&gt;ive got a heavy lean towards naxx for best raid
---
That's a funny way of spelling Ulduar
---
Uh, curse of recklessness?
---
You can bring some cheap ones, like food or an elixir. Flask are too expensive.
---
I'm on Heartseeker, Alliance is definitely dominating there. Having 60% of PvP players play Horde doesn't mean every server is 40A/60H, it only means that if a server like Hearthseeker is 75A/25H or Incendius is 55A/45H, then another server (ie.: Stalagg, Skeram) has even more than 60% Horde.
---
My point being that as far as server balance is concerned, even if Blizzard enforced rules to evenly distribute population to try to reach the best possible balance, without forcing faction transfer on any Horde player, then every server would be 40A/60H, which is still pretty imbalanced, imho.
---
Remind me I’ll post the macro I use, I have it bound to the F key (any will work) where a F cycles back and forth between battle and prot and ctrl-F cycles between battle and berserker
---
By that level Paladins have bubble + LoH, I was able to 1v2 win against a lock then mage one right after the other on my paladin with the lock being my level and the mage was 5 or so levels above me.  
---
The lock just didn't have any burst damage and 1 heal pretty much got me to full before he could re-fear me, is there any way to know when the fear will break to get off another one before the paladin can heal?
---
It is doable in classic and you can still have fun with it. But it's about as competitive as a melee hunter in high level play.
---
just level inside instances?  I dinged 60 just before honor released but I spent most of my time inside BRD/LBRS/UBRS/STRAT/SCHOLO anyway.  You're gonna need gear from there anyway.
---
That’s a big fucking attic
---
Yeah, but by the time AB is out, the people in the “good premades” we are talking about won’t be ranking anymore
---
I would never bring a 57 healer to scholomance.  Once exception may be if they are a healer on voice chat with me, and the rest of the group has a lot of MC gear or their phase 1 bis, and there were no other options online at the moment.
---
That's for landing grenades, these are outright resisting.
---
Not just using them against orcs myself, I am finding quite a few non-orcs seem to resist outright. (The chat window pops up literal "Resist" when it goes off)
---
The commenter might be 13 years old at the time with no experience in RPGs whatsoever. I would give it a rest.
---
First of I doubt it that you 100-0 a druid with that sequence, second you need to be engi and destruction specced. And as destruction you'll lose a lot of other setups. The destruction specced WL in the dueling tourney didn't really fare well.
---
Who would you flirt with then? Ooooohhhh... I see the problem now, you’re afraid you’ll be flirting with a dude, lol.
---
It’s ok bud, that doesn’t make you gay.
---
Bit on the long side when all the action could fit inside a gif.
---
I think you didn't understand my point. Im not suggesting that they spawn every 30 seconds and  have a few spawns up at the same time. I'm saying that People are not really flasking right now because the not much point to do that in MC. The issue might be that the is not enough lotus to go arround like flask going on 400-500g each and you can't see them on the AH. People complained hardcore about the Devisaur mafia. Just you wait for the lotus mafia.
---
Where did I say that? OP said he didn't see why pugs would ever go to WSG unless it's a bonus weekend. All I'm saying is some people out there, like myself, don't mind getting steamrolled sometimes and will be perfectly fine pugging into WSG when I'm bored. I don't need to masterbate to my honor/hr spreadsheet while my guildies tell me dirty stories about what they did to the enemy pugs.
---
You seem like a decent person, if you're ever in alliance rattlegore let me know
---
Lol, k.
---
I also raided with quite a few pugs before joining this guild and always heard at least a few women talking in disc, but they were always part of the larger group who was picking up the pugs and probably felt more comfortable.  I think the more the group is pug, the less people who aren't leading will be talking in general at all, because they don't know each other.
---
I can only smile when I think about all those undead rogues that have nobody to gank now :)
---
I'm not here for honor rewards I just want to kill some horde.
---
Well I'll say it again: back in the day most servers were PVE. This time Bliz released mostly PVP servers. I'm sure plenty of folks like PVP, but that doesn't mean they are cut out for PvP servers. It's ok, let bliz know that PvP to PVE transfers are what you desire. Please, stop acting like anything is new, my old PVP server, Detheroc, was a 24/7 pvp shit show even into BC. It comes with the territory.
---
The drama!
---
I liked to pretend I was special forces while firing shadow bolts at allies from beneath the surface.  Had a rogue actually try to dive out after me once; didn't end well for him.
---
&gt;Small price to pay for being the coolest looking.
---
It pains me that some people actually think that is true. I'd put undead somewhere between dwarves and gnomes near the bottom of the list.
---
Bless of Freedom only stops movement impairing effects/slows. It does not stop fear.
---
dude of course, everyone loves mudhuts and poop sewers
---
A crit is double damage. The same as a second attack. How is a second attack somehow better?  What am I missing
---
I love how people are making gnome mates to karma farm this
---
I am, but is still hard to keep aggro on +3 mobs without rage though. Without many melee mobs, I have to rely on my own attacks + Bloodrage (when it isn't on cd), and lack of rage means no Sunder/BattleS/DemoS spam to keep aggro. Our casters did single-target attacks as I tagged mostly, but the mobs that I'm not able to sunder will go to the healer and make me waste a Taunt/MB. There are also those necromancers that spawn skeletons that made our casters use aoe making matters worse. 
---
Also take in account this was my first Scholo run ever so I knew jackshit of how mobs worked so they led the way. Oh, I'm also currently arms as I'm still trying to get my BiS, so no concussion for me.
---
Building up rage is good, but there are also the pauses to drink water.
---
I run 2 accounts right now and I enjoy it.
---
So for leveling purposes, I had a 60 already, and leveled a hunter on the second while using my main to help the hunter through some things. (Dungeons, getting ganked and killing some elite quests)
---
Even now, I sometimes bring both characters to raid (hunter autoshot afk lol).
---
But for your purposes, seems like a great idea. Portals, access to magefood/water at all times, and you can almost summon yourself anywhere (need an extra person for the ritual).
---
It's not a terrible plan.
---
Maybe you should reconsider what game you play if you don't like the rules.
---
how is that possible? they have no one to kill? I do not PVP unless im farming so I really have no idea how the systems functions.
---
No, they have legitimate grievances with Onyxia.
---
Where did you get this info?
---
My own experience hasn't been like this, scouted all 6 spots with the two of us (so less downtime) and not a single spot had a pool
---
Worth it.
---
Traps
---
The is a easy to get off hand that has 15 fire resistance.
---
Earthfury is really good dad server growing in popularity
---
What? No she wasn't. She was all about protecting the Night Elf lands from invaders. I don't think there's a single line of hers that can be interpreted as wanting to "purge the other races."

---
The farmers lived there the whole time...it's more theirs than anyone elses
---
Just because I don't agree with it doesn't mean I don't understand your point.
---
For the record, I never attacked a grey (and as a Holy Priest, that's pretty much the only people I can solo), but hey, if calling me a little bitch makes you feel better about yourself, go ahead, I can take it. However, I don't see how you can think that insulting me this way will lead to a constructive discussion...
---
The fact remains that Warcraft is a *war* between Humans (and their allies) and Orcs (and the horde), and as the saying goes, all is fair in war and love.
---
But hey, you can keep trying to insult me, maybe that will change my opinion.
---
Still, the idea that killing a lowbie would be a dishonorable kill brings more problems than it solves.
---
* What are you supposed to do if a level 48 is spamming heals on the person you're fighting?
---
* What if that level 48 straight up engages you, are you allowed to kill him then?
---
* What if a level 48 is camping your level 42 guildie? ie.: It's not a "dishonorable kill" for the 48 to kill the 42, but it would be one for you to help your own guildie...?
---
&gt; consequences for negative actions
---
If we'd agree that killing a grey is a "negative action", then maybe we'd agree there should be consequences for it, but I don't agree with it, even if I, myself, don't do it.
---
How do you suggest the aforementioned scenarios should be handled? If your answer is "Oh, if they're the ones to initiate PvP, then they would be "flagged" and no longer be considered "dishonorable kills", then I hope you can see how close that is to being exactly what rules on a PvE server are...
---
Now, can you discuss this like a mature adult, without trying to insult me, or would you rather behave like a school yard bully?
---
Don't act like its different on balanced servers. Lowbies don't get heroically saved by other players, those are busy farming other lowbies. You are 100% on your own once you hit 50.
---
In a land they stole/invaded and killed the God of.
---
For Solenor, I dueled my hunter friend and gave him curse of recklessness to make him immune to fears. Was very easy
---
Guarantee that dude reported you for cheating too. (I’m not saying you did btw. But I’m sure he thinks you did! Hahah)
---
I am going to do calculations when BG's spawn, as I will be doing AV first for the rewards for the first few days then flipping over to WSG.
---
Basically you can look at how much honor/hr you get from AV zerg, premade or not, and then compare it to WSG best case and you can safely determine how fast you need to win WSG consistently, to get the same amount of honor.
---
Then why not just play on PVE and avoid the problem entirely? I feel like a lot people set themselves up for a bad experience with their own behaviour.
---
Apparently they're opening transfers up to PVE servers in the future
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
Where is upper blackrock depths?
---
Did you understand what I just said? "The horde" didn't go too far, everyone is just playing pvp at the maximum capability and efficiency, which in an unbalanced server means 10v1s, nonstop ganking and entire zones being wiped of allys. That is *not* how the game was envisioned to be played way back when, nor was it possible to do so, but you can't blame players for having the coordination and knowledge to play the game at full potential, even if it's at the expense of the fun of others. 
---
Players will always do whatever they can to get as many rewards as they can. Having people quitting playing because of that is terrible, but this "horde players are evil" narrative is ridiculous
---
That's so cute
---
Dude. The creep is real. I played female toons on Horde back in the day just so that my toons felt slightly more interesting/unique. Never again. Amazing what kind of freaks come out of the woodwork and start messaging you over a pair of digital, green sweater cows. Yeesh.
---
Yeah, but there are channels to go through if you have greavances. Speak with the the captain and request an audience with bolvar or something. Dont go murdering  innocents because you got stiffed on the bill.
---
Thanks lads. I'll finish my LBRS quests then go onto ubrs tomorrow then. Scholomance I will save for 59+
---
Good for you. I'm just hitting that point. Got 60, got epic mount and opting out of the raid gear grind.
---
I laughed more than I should... Considering I am a girl.
---
No it doesn’t
---
Yep good luck! 
---
LBRS is a wild ride and has some good pieces in it. Don't forget about Strat dead for 59/60, it has robes of the exalted and the neckpiece!
---
Sounds like you've watched a little Epic NPC Man on youtube
---
Benediction
---
25 days played never seen a bot
---
I mean, on my server, the answer is definitely yes. Level 60 Horde are the root cause for a very significant slowdown in leveling for 45-59 Alliance.  
---
Alliance occasionally take control of a zone for a little bit. But Horde have been irrationally ruthless in every 45+ zone, and the boats, and all the FPs in the neutral zones.  
---
You sit around looking for a group (especially bad for poor DPS who are a dime a dozen), and in your limited play time, you get very little accomplished.  
---
Good god, I can't wait for BGs!
---
Stormwind (and many of the other Human nations, such as Gilneas and the Kirin Tor) had very minor involvement in the Third War. Orc internment camps were all in Lordaeron, most Human nations only had secondary engagement with Quel'thalas due to distance, Lordaeron quarantined their whole kingdom during the plague outbreak, and the governments of Ironforge and Gnomeregan were barely involved in the decisionmaking of the post-Scourge "Alliance" led by Garithos. While the Alliance of Lordaeron and the WoW-era Alliance have many factions in common, the vast majority of each nation's populace kept to themselves, so you can't say "all Warcraft Humans are racist" just based on Lordaeron.
---
There's a sexist joke here somewhere.
---
I remember seeing a mage in BC with Thunderfury. This is even wilder.
---
&gt; I and many others enjoy
---
there's overwhelming  evidence that 'many' is an overstatement at best.
---
I finally got my leaf and thought the hard part was behind me...
---
Holy shit this is actually really hard. Just getting the mob to yourself is impossible, but when I did I died like 4 times in a row. Artorious is hard to kite at max range while also getting arcane shots in and dodging mobs.
---
9000 horde 200 ally high pop
---
They other jerk has a point, but even more important is this- you're only one person.  If alliance is outnumbered in every zone by 10, your 1 person presence can make a difference or at least avoid the action.  If alliance is outnumbered in every zone by 50, your presence means nothing and you mean nothing unless you can find 30 more people to band with- which is totally stupid and impractical in a game designed around content for 2-5.
---
Way to cold out right now, you won’t do it.
---
Well he explains the difference it makes. NPC guards are at a fixed number. Not a percentage of population. 
---
And then you can carry that logic all the way down to the very ground. The space of the game is limited. It doesnt increase with server size.
---
You'd expect it on TV, radio and all other forms of popular media. Only equivalent in wow is the game client. And for those ever stuck in queues, it was a big button whilst you waited.

I just install and run wow off a USB stick. Load times are plenty fast with USB 2.0 and hardly noticable on USB 3.0. Sometimes battle.net launcher gets confused when you switch computers and it has to scan for the install since it thinks nothing is installed but other than that I works great. Never copy any files!
---
Nobody is required to play at maximum capability and efficiency. It is possible to envision consequences for ones' actions and hold oneself back, ya psycho.
---
So with LFG in retail, it is easy to do end game mythics and PvP to get geared.
---
I'm not too familiar with the wow classic endgame. While having coordination with a guild is pretty essential for endgame pve, is there a way for a solo player to grind endgame without too much trouble? Is there gear you can get from endgame PvP as a solo?
---
Then I was just unlucky and the fears ended quickly after hits from my vw. I'll try pulling my pet off after throwing out a fear. Would their bubble resist fear?
---
its EU only
---
So 100? Or 10?
---
Or just say one in forty thousand.
---
ZT is a server, not a guild.
---
You just can't roll solo as either faction. Gotta be in a group.
---
ZanadalarTribe
---
Where do you get this?
---
They tried to use 'em and were blocked out, thanks to nobles / Onyxia.
---
No, I just hit reset cap and then do something else on my main toon
---
Orgrimmar is poppin! The server has a slight alliance advantage in numbers, but world pvp feels really balanced.
---
At least 5 capped AB ends really fast, certainly faster than leaving and waiting on deserter debuff.
---
Plus you still get a token for the loss, so it's not a complete waste of time.
---
Sure, let's go with pure confirmation bias instead. HOrdE bAd aLliAncE gOoD
---
They will: their own second accounts created on other faction side for farm. If you think about how much time people will invest in ranking r14 (that's much more than full-time job), an extra $30-45 a months is nothing.
---
Didnt grenade level affect the chance and are youbattacoing classes like priests that have talents to resist stuns etc
---
Dwarves and gnomes at the bottom of the list? Yeah sorry that list is irrelevant.
---
&gt; dont go murdering
---
Bro, that's all i do for quest givers in this game
---
So you're dueling the best players off the world all the time? Or do you rather beat some random guy who's farming mobs and think that destruction is the hot shit?
---
That sounds like either a bug or bs - I used slam extensively enough in vanilla and tbc to know with certainty that once the cast started, your weapon swing was fully reset no matter how close to the next swing you were. Slamming early gimped your dps.
---
Guaranteed mage in a PvP premade, they can just port and queue within 30s
---
Well then he just wasnt trying hard enough tbh.
---
"I don't enjoy their aesthetic so no one else can."
---
Of course..
---
Earthshaker is balanced as of right now, it was alliance leaning before literally the whole of flamelash transfered there
---
However, if your pet is chasing a feared player, it quite often despawns which is unbelievably crippling.
---

---
The Third War is hardly even a thing.
---
And we don't need to go to Lordaeron to find The Alliance are racist. They prove it on Reddit all the time.
---
Ok but I bet the dude cringing isn't named Lilwayne, it's like Trueheart or McChivalrous or some shit.
---
Whose that rogue that was famous for camping booty bay? There used to be an album with people whispering hate mail to him
---
gz!
---
Haha good one
---
Spy won't re-target until you can see them yourself.
---
Speaking of which, WOW newspaper is fucking brilliant. Imagine how many people would sign up for that if it was done well, the best types of stories that we like to see on Reddit posts, but in newspaper format, with opinion sections and the "Ask Chromie" column. Some comments from our readers...
---
Why has nobody done this? Are there some inherent issues I'm missing that would tank this idea?
---
Sylvanas is evil, not the forsaken as a whole.
---
There was a whole meeting of forsaken and their human living relatives. It went pretty well, before Sylvanas swooped in killed a ton of people.
---
Just the humans, really, and who's to say they don't have it coming? The dwarves they poison just got in the way with their guns and stuff.
---
(only kinda /s)
---
That's the only good reason.
---
Upper blackrock spire probably
---
Kirtonos is like 40/60 horde dom but the alliance is very competitive and actively pvping.
---
justice for the murlocs
---
Where is Arthas? Where is my son?
---
If you are off tanking it’s probably not as important to get edgies. But if you want to dps or are in a main tank role, the reduction in hit will help as well as the glancing blow reduction (which is the big, unspoken benefit of the weapon skill)
---
im basing on the fact that when im world pvping i still shit on everything that isnt another warlock with SL and possibly a rogue, whats the point of playing SL if u still beat every other spec without it?
---
Feel free to ignore this
---
You should have a few ranks of the heals on your bars. It's a lot more mana efficient (esp. when you have +healing ) to cast lower rank heals and save higher ranks for oh-shit moments. A side-effect is that it also helps with over healing, you don't want to heal 500dmg with a 2k heal.
---
I was partaking in some Everlook brawling and I had a moment of realization that there was at least 6, probably more, gnome frost mages. Dime a dozen.
---
incompetent alliance.
---
Healbot is just a gui interface for macros. All it's doing is setting up macros in the background. I used to use healbot in wotlk but have since gone to macros to reduce the dependency on addons
---
This guild: Okay guys we gotta decide who gets Sulfuras. We need to be smart about this because this weapon is really powerful.
---
Also this guild: give it to the giant laser beam deer-chicken. He will know what to do with it.
---
Would be interested t hear your results! I'll be doing a fair bit of AV to start for the rep rewards, filling in the spare time with the occasional premade WSG to
---
Given the opportunity and the ability to do so, most players will do just that, if it benefits them. Classic wow is just vanilla on steroids: everything that can be minmaxed, will be minmaxed. From leveling to raiding to killing people on flyposts.
---
Blizzard was naive, and they are only realizing this now
---
Crucial point of discussion missing - a lot of people think 10x the players means 10x the competition. Yes and no. The average type of player who returned to classic is considerably sweatier than the average player back then. There's a definite ratio, varying by bracket, of how much more tryhard each bracket is than they used to be. So, while on paper, the increased number of spots made up for more brackets, once you start looking past, say, bracket 11, competition looks like it's stiffer than before.

didn't test for 2 whole day, but there's horde gank squad roaming in westfall... that's for sure.
---
No... Definitely Blizzard... This shit could have been solved weeks ago if they had just listened and done faction specific transfers and queues...
---
&gt; Not a percentage of population.
---
Likewise, the size of raids against an enemy faction's city aren't based on a % of the population.
---
ie.: If I want to raid something, I'll see how many people we can get and if we don't have enough for Org, we'll settle for something smaller.
---
Isn't 30 days played something like 6 hours everyday since launch?
---
wow census sucks , is better trow a dice
---
Respecced feral tank?
---
Yeah they do. There's subreddits for like every Classic server as well as Official WoW server forums.
---
Think of it like this, a big AoE pull without thorns on tank will likely result in your HoTs pulling threat on a few mobs at some point unless the tank can properly identify the adds he's losing aggro on. Having thorns will cause him to generate at least a small bit of threat on all mobs
---
if you are alliance player with level 60ty   
---
Easiest 14 rank :D  
---
I mean after that you can just pay to server transfer
---
Would have done nothing. People on the faction that had the queue would just quit and as people hear about people quittin to go to other servers they would soon follow.
---
It's all blizzards fault.. bingo
---
Just misunderstood really, we just want to share undeath with everyone so we can have perfect peace.   A merry Undeath to all!   
---
Check out our new album Christmas album 'An Undead Cannibal Christmas', its a great stocking stuffer and comes with a free severed foot.
---
Yeah I have 3 add-ons basically. Healbot. Questie and atlas loot. 
---
 I didn't use questie untill LVL 40 and healbot untill LVL 52. I wish I had known sooner though lol. Atlas loot when I hit 60. I am a total newcomer to wow so I now have TSM as well but don't know how to use it lol I just like how it sorts everything easily.
---
And they call it a mine... A MINE!
---
It's cloudy now tho
---
It could be argued that the shitty honor system forced them to play that way. If some tweaks had been made to honor system it could have solved all of these issues.
---
You're so angry and I love it lol
---
Jaina took him seriously.
---
No one believes me when I say that trinket is bis.
---
How would you like a trinket that gives you, as a tank war:
---
1.25% crit, 1.25% dodge, 1.25 block, 50 armor, 50 ap, and 250 hp
---
Well that's literally what you're getting, almost permanently because it's always procced.
---
Are you like twelve or something? Jesus.
---
Right? Says it's just simple math. Doesnt explain the "simple math"
---
I played for many years and got mine at 54^^
---
True, they had to get the boats themselves. But Medivh did send them to Kalimdor to kill the natives and set up shop.
---
You treat humans like cattle. If you could spawn kill someone in counter strike over and over again for an hour. Do you really think they would keep spawning? It's a god damn big line between world pvp and whats going on right now. How the hell can you sink so low? Don't you have any form of integrity??
---
You look at chat and talk to other players in real time! There are groups for all kinds of shit forming all the time and it's pretty easy to form your own group if you don't see what you're looking for.
---
/join lookingforgroup
---
/join lfg
---
I recommend making a new chat tab for these channels or your chat pane is about to be unreadable.
---
Also whitemain, I quit. The game is unplayable. After my 7th or so 1 hour walk to BRD I had enough. I'm playing other games now and having 100x more fun. Sorry wow but you lost me forever.
---
the stormwind nobility are a bunch of dicks, but killing hundred of people and razing entire villages while instauring a reign of terror ISN'T a proportionate reaction to not being paid
---
dO yOu ThInK tHiS iS fUnNy?!?!!
---
How much Horde from Flamelash actually transferred to Earthshaker  to follow the fleeing alliance?
---
FRESH BREAD FOR SALE
---
Youre basically trying to argue that larger servers dont *actually* see more people playing the game. Its a strange hill to die on, but hey have fun.
---
Or if alliance could have stood and fought instead of crying on reddit and running
---
There's another tree like it on the other side of the hill that's farther away from road if anyone is having trouble on a pvp server.
---
Because they only changed that system to prepare for TBC. Somewhere they said that this will not happen.
---
This is fucking fascinating.
---
This is true. Windfury is stronger but it does no good to proc for the last 10% of the mobs health. Because of this the smoother damage output of rockbiter is nearly identical overtime. In example if you are killing 10 mobs then it might take 20sec each for rockbiter and with windfury you kill 5 in  10 secs and 5 in 30 secs if you got bad rng on procs. Both shamans killed 10 enemies in 200 sec.
---
So the best news it that it's personal preference! You pick what you want and will be advancing roughly the same pace.
---
What? That's is twice as worse, as it costs more and needs 2 impossible drops
---
Ah that seems right, thanks!
---
God damn knife eared bastards, *hic*
---
Guild running while leveling is probably mostly a lost cause at this point.  The biggest wave of players on classic have been 60 a while now, and its now trickles of alts and casuals now.  It might be slightly more viable from 50+ as people start longer dungeon grinds for BIS, but again, you're late to the party here and limiting your dungeon parties to guild-only may be unrealistic. 
---
A guild could spend 30 hours a week carrying their lowbies through dungeons they ground the fuck out of for months, and then still watch those people leave their guild.  A lot of newbs have horrible unrealistic expectations there when pugs are 10x more efficient.  You'll be fine.  I pugged my entire journey to 60, and its still easier to PUG a scholo run when I need more skins of shadow for a libram...
---
From personal experience as a druid. If I'm healing dungeons, I'm usually in pvp spec which means no threat reduction. And if I get a dps warrior tanking, that means I basically will have mobs beating on me on any big aoe pull.
---
Dog it’s so fucking cool that you responding to me. Underrated celeb haha.
---
804 Ap with 21.27 crit or  744 Ap with 22.87 crit?
---
Also I’m arms thinking about going slam spec but never done it and I’m looking forward to battlegrounds
---
I don't say this often, as I'm a sweaty tryhard, but... Calm down it's a fucking game. 
---
Also, people being overly dramatic like you are more than enough incentive to keep doing it lol.
---
retail is bad though.
---
Pretty much all of those were killed, naga-fied, or became high elves though.
---
No, there's overwhelming evidence that a lot of people don't like what the honor system has done during phase 2. You absolutely did not see this number of complaints during phase 1 and the complaints you are seeing aren't about the wpvp that I'm talking about and you know it. Myself and others are rightly critical of the honor system for the reasons I stated in the comment you originally replied to. The honor system breaks the wpvp that I and many others found enjoyable. Phase 2 is not a good example of the wpvp that was fun in vanilla. I said as much in my earlier comments. You have some sort of vendetta against world pvp, that's fine, but you're being disingenuous with how you're painting the situation and the comments I've made.
---
&gt;f
---
Fuck. First the frogs, now this?
---
...Dwarves are the only decent race on the alliance in classic. The fuck you smokin!?
---
I have yet to find a mean Tauren player
---
if you like tanking and have a raid tank spot, definitely go full bear the 10% physical dmg from balance is a buttload of extra threat :)
---
Yeah exactly this. They absolutely have reason to be angry at Stormwind City's elite, so they destroy the lives and property of the people in Westfall - because that will show em! It's like being angry with the federal government so you burn down the local school.
---
I wanted to play rp on ally but my friends insisted on pvp horde.  Blurgh.
---
Rule 1..
---
If I had just started on a PvE server I would still be playing. I had to stop playing after constantly getting killed trying to quest. I spent more time corpse running than I did actually questing. I get that’s part of the game, but I don’t have that much time to play anyway, so it made the whole experience pretty terrible.
---
&gt; even pugs clear in 1-1.5hour
---
maybe 1% of pugs can manage this, probably literally none of them actually
---
Its almost as if players have become smart and know the Horde are the best at PvP and already began its snowball.
---
I don't get why anyone on Alliance even went to a PvP server to begin with. They shoulda saw this coming.
---
You didnt get 15 HKs the first time to qualify.
---
it's a display error, you've got 12 kills
---
Exactly, better racials. Also can choose a look besides short/medium/tall human and skinny or fat human. Undead hairstyles. I'm sure there's more I'm missing.
---
should have rolled PvE lol
---
Back in Quel'Thalas EU, there was the legendary Dwarf "Walus". Without fail, every evening in Ironforge, you'd find him autorunning with a mount on top of the mailbox. He angled the mount in a weird way, and combined with the autorun, it looked like he was humping the mailbox.
---
He was persistent, and unrelenting. I'd be preparing for a raid, there he is going at it with the mailbox. Back from the raid, he's still there. Strangely enough, he always had amazing PvE gear, I don't know how he found the time to raid in between all the mailbox humping.
---
In BC, his legend grew even further as he was one of the first people on the server to get an Amani War Bear, which made his mailbox violation activities even more noticeable. I have no clue what happened to him or if he still plays. Wherever you are, God speed to you Walus, you magnificent bastard.
---
Get a warlock friend for the one in Silithus. 
---
That’s all I really remember and I was a terrible hunter lol

---
&gt;He wanted to know unit price 
---
I wouldn't trade with anyone who can't divide by 10.
---
What do you mean no one put up a fight? The mongols waged a bloody campaign of conquest across Asia. People weren't lining up to submit. They raped, pillaged, enslaved, and murdered everywhere they went. You can't look at that and think "they couldn't have been **that** bad."
---
I'm gonna post what I posted above to someone talking about Garithos, it still fits to your response too.
---
&gt;He was only in charge because literally all the leadership was murdered, he just happened to have the highest remaining rank..his authority wasnt even recognized by most people..Just think of the situation, your king, your prince, literally all the upper nobles/knights/religious order are ALL DEAD. Your kingdom is in ruin, weird rampaging undead everywhere that even might include your own family trying to eat your brains. All that trauma. There's ONE person with a cohesive military unit, OBVIOUSLY you try to join/rely on that person.
---
How could anyone expect people to NOT be acting insulated and xenophobic at that time? And racism against the Forsaken? Dude, an undead plague just murdered like 80% of the population, wtf? Obviously you wouldnt just trust them..
---
Yup. Also roll PvE if you didn't want to PvP. You all brought this on yourselves.
---
Check out the old Pat PVP 2 video.  Rank 14 warrior during a glitched patch where this was possible.  Absolutely hilarious
---
Blood elf racial was changed to an aoe single dispel instead of a silence in BFA. That could be why.
---
The current endgame content is easy enough that you can do it with pugs or just a casual guild. 4h a week is enough for even the most casual guild to clear everything.
---
Then a bunch of dwarves with guns and helicopters show up, so they call them undesirables and torture them to death.
---
They raped our crops and burned our women! What choice did we have?!
---
What? I got helped by dozens of allies doing quests, kill elites mobs, and hard packs just communicating via emotes
---
Nah they're just super isolationist. Probably less so after being shoehorned into the Alliance.
---
The nelfs are cool, it a shame Wow develops most of its alliance story around humans.
---
Firemaw
---
Yeah this is exactly how firemaw looks too. Even the lag is familiar, I'm guessing once the head popped the server nearly died.
---
lmao that is gold
---
That fucking tunnel on the way into DM is a nightmare. I had to do 9 corpse runs to get to DMN this past weekend.
---
I dunno I don't feel much "danger" since I'm guaranteed to die if there is anyone between me and the dungeon I want to run. It's just a tax on my time, and the time of everyone doing anything that isn't pvp
---
It's in Blizz's own rules that camping a player in excess is griefing.
---
If all others are 60 I think scholo is just fine.
---
i think a guy made a count a few hours before the end of the transfer and there were like 86 alliance player left including 12 levels 60
---
There's a lot of horde still around so I'm guessing not many.
---
Very curious about this same question. 
---
I’m a fury warrior who has been off-tanking in raids and managed to get my hands on a cheap book for Quels. 
---
I have Rends off hand and Mirah’s as my main hand, since Rend MH is, well, what it is...
---
Is it viable to use Quels and Mirahs as DW weapons?  Or should I sell book and invest in LHH instead. 
---
I’d also like to move to more of an MT role at some point, so that’s more points for Quels...  although I think LHH has more longevity, as Quels can be replaced with BWL gear.
---
Hey. Can you link me when you upload it? Its so amazing! I want to Print it
---
geaux tigers
---
They do ban people for this.
---
Ah gotcha, I played vanilla through WotLK and then have not consumed any knowledge of anything Cat or beyond. I appreciate the update!
---
Why does that sound so like the Alliance, while also fitting a neoliberalist?
---
Why not 1 right after the other? 5500 damage after a 1.5 sec cast with a shock follow up
---
Yep, the more gear you have the less mana pots and runes you need. The mp5 food is still great to make you the need to pop a pot even less
---
Well I've played Undead Horde side forever (literally since 2004).  But in the spirit of WoW's never-ending combat, I've rolled an Alliance character just to even it up.
---
        
---
If just some percent of Hordies on unbalanced servers switched to the underdog for a while we could even it out.   All we need is about  two dozen of us to roll a pally and it'll be even.
---
No. No they didn't tip.
---
Well, in America maybe, who is not getting a tip in there I guess.
---
I swear to god if there is a complaint about wPVP being dead. You dumbass mother fuckers go queue AV and join the rest of your faction stomping around hillsbrad.
---
Unfortunately for you, history will not see it this way
---
=O
---
Pagle, the only server in the game that matters.
---
Wow. The first person ive found so far actually explain why 6v4 is not the same as 60v40. Good on you.
---
same
---
Yep that's the idea!
---
&gt;But I don’t think it’s worth it with so many better trinkets.
---
Just swap out trinket when it's on CD?
---
Also resets the swing.
---
Unless you plan to keep the 2h on for a while spamming cleave, it isn't worth it.
---
apparently people don't like radiohead?
---
Dal'rends MH has higher Max Weapon dmg and it gives 50+ atk power + 1% crit Quel never rly been a good dps weapon
---
BG will be cross-realms.
---
the horde on flamelash isn't loosing anything.. at all.
---
All we can tell from this is that you have 7 kills this week 2 kills last week and three kills the week before. None of your weeks have qualified you to earn rank so you have no rank. This picture makes perfect sense.
---
Don't reward this shit company with more of your money
---
It's not going to be as fun as you think.
---
Yeah here on Fairbanks its nearly 70:30 horde favored.. and it fucking blows.  
---
I love world-pvp but I hate the insane camping and griefing going on.
---
More then 7
---
I have Heal rank 4 on my bar for downranking purposes, but I wasn't sure how low I should downrank to.
---
well yeah, everything's gonna take longer and that's still your best option sadly.  It took me near 2 weeks to finish The Jailbreak quest for the same reason.  I've honestly took a brake and waiting for Dec 10th to chill some of these fiends out.
---
Or 200 honor is too much to pass up over some arbitrary fishing etiquette.
---
It's been my experience that people who play Tauren are usually the most chill and fun to hang with.
---
&gt; Sure, let's go with pure confirmation bias instead. HOrdE bAd aLliAncE gOoD
---
No one is using confirmation bias, the other guy who replied to you provided better information than you and you tried to disprove it with old outdated data and now you are ignoring it as if it doesn't exist. That is very dishonest of you given the conversation.
---
Yeah I have volunTOLD our heal team that they are playing AV with me for a few days. The offhand is just too freaking strong.
---
I think you'd be surprised. I'm no pro at looking at WCL but our clear was a 60 for speed and we keep a fair pace on trash imo. Plenty of people I know in other guilds are still taking quite a bit longer and no one in those guilds seems to mind.
---
Thanks for this - I like the idea of being self sufficient too and don’t want to play the game just to min/max or level as fast as possible - I want to actually enjoy the experience. Europe - I heard ZT is a really good server for RP PVP!
---
For me, that is what classic is, if you compare it to retail. You make your way in classic by getting better equipment/levels etc. Especially in the beginning, it feels like you're just a player controlled mob.
---
It's EU
---
I’m incredibly glad I wasn’t interested in joining classic until the week of launch, by the time I joined with my wife, we were set on a new pve server and life has been great. I get to hardcore raid, she gets to fish.
---
Everything has been gravy.  Had I been watching the conversation since the #nochange movement I’d be on an overpopulated pvp server regretting what I was putting my wife through just to enjoy a game from my teen years again.
---
That's not what I said at all.
---
What I said is that "the size of raids against an enemy faction's city aren't based on a % of the population".
---
If I was twisting your words like you're doing mine, I'd be saying you're arguing that if a "full" server raids MC with 40 people per raid, then a "half full" server raids MC with 20 people per raid.
---
I logged off and played D3 haha. I am not having fun doing 5-10 or anything more than 2 corpse runs. I will come back after battlegrounds.
---

---
PvP servers are already tipped towards horde. They'll be getting queues and alliance won't.
---
Last time I went through westfall the Defias seemed to have recovered pretty well from all my work actually. There was even a posse forming to take out VanCleef again, somehow resurrected.
---
Just joking about how the nature of an mmo makes the kind of thing depicted in this very good fan art impossible to ever reflect in game.
---
Blizzard let this player pay money and transfer servers.
---
I think you're looking too deeply into this when in actuality it's not a real thing. People just happened to choose what they chose at that moment for a MULTITUDE of reasons, many of which have absolutely nothing to do with "culture" or "style of play". I bet the number one reason people chose what they chose is because they did so with the last character they rolled in retail or wherever they played last. IMO the main reason to pick one or the other are the differences in racials and character types that you can choose (wanting something other than just a human character model to choose from).
---
Well don't just leave us hanging. Which podcast is it?
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
I mean.. I rolled horde for my friends and shit like this makes me hate being here I wish I could faction change.
---
&gt; and a God who attacked and tried to destroy them for doing such.
---
Yes, because they were literally invading a land. They also had the stench of DEMON BLOOD eminating from them, and Cenarius banded with the good forces of Azeroth to literally save it from those very Demons. Turns out his initial misgivings were correct, Grom ends up slurping the demon juice AGAIN FOR A SECOND TIME AFTER SWEARING UP AND DOWN HE AND HIS ORCS ARE REFORMED. Yea, nice.
---
Make sure you have herb and mining each run will net you a ton of gromsblood some dreamfoil, some ghost mushroom, and a few rich thorium veins
---
Earthfury.  Alliance has an advantage and BRM is extremely safe, but the advantage is not so overwhelming that the rest of the world is safe.  It's close enough that, long term, I think it has a chance of evening out.
---
 You ONLY use wind fury after 30 come on guys.. we only get groups for windfury totems..
---
Somehow this went from buyer being brain damaged to then OP having a stroke and making this even more confusing
---
This is a very good point. 
---
E Gaming has gotten so competitive and serious lately that this is what you get. Especially with the streamers.
---
Come to stalagg alli then talk about how the horde dominates lmao
---
Just unsubscribe and do something else with the time/money.
---
When I signed up for a PvP server, I expected constant 1v1s while farming.  Not constant 40v1s.
---
Are you serious? Here's a response to another post as ill informed as yours.
---
&gt;Yes, because they were literally invading a land that belonged to someone else. They were also chopping down LIVING CREATURES for timber. They also had the stench of DEMON BLOOD eminating from them, and Cenarius banded with the good forces of Azeroth to literally save it from those very Demons. Turns out his initial misgivings were correct, Grom ends up slurping the demon juice AGAIN FOR A SECOND TIME AFTER SWEARING UP AND DOWN HE AND HIS ORCS ARE REFORMED. Yea, nice.

Or “Top 5 r/classicwow posts are all Alliance players bitching about something or the other”

Pretty much the same thing as a free space though

Big Bad Bear here. I was planning on going HOTW/NS spec, but tanks are minimal. I've healed a whole 5-6 times from 1-44 (where I currently am). I decided to go full bear and am digging into Balance talents for that sweet sweet Omen of Clarity. Need to get 46 though. I do have a healset in my bank that i keep fairly updated and have not had ANY issue healing as of yet. Have a R4, R5, R8 healing touch, max Rejuv and Regrowth and you're fine. I don't use Regrowth hardly ever because it is so expensive, only pre-pull as tank *sometimes* if i don't have any rage.
---
 [talents so far](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-50500213032221)
---
For cat talents, all the talents I have benefit bear, except for the 100% double combo point on ability crit in cat. If I dumped that, I could get the Omen talent right now, but it really does help speed things up while questing.

Agi &gt;&gt; Strength &gt; Stam &gt; Armor &gt; Spirit is what I prioritize for stats.

you say this like there arent going to be a bunch of absolute shitters who think being in a group = free win, without actually knowing what the fuck to do when up against resistance, even pug resistance
---
6.0g?
---
If you're new to druids completely, then welcome! You're coming in at the bottom of the experience. It all gets better from here, so if you like the class please feel free to hang around. Also if you're new, please check out Alamo on wowwiki. Required reading. :p
---
Most everyone gave some pretty dope advice, I'm not going to echo them. I can confirm that resto/kitty does great at 60, healing raids and farming solo very easily. Dire Bear will be a great upgrade, you will see a difference. Don't be afraid to shift in or out of forms, just remember to save enough mana to get back into bear. Druids are clutch as FUCK. The number of times I've completely changed the outcome of an encounter gone wrong is absurd. Battle rez is dope, always carry a stack of reagents. Resto/bear is also great, I'm just more of a kitty person because bear ass is annoying. You get swipe at 16, which is your AOE threat builder, and it's a game changer. It's what makes you better in dungeons than a warrior. It's also what enables you to clear out whole camps of mobs. 
---
Somewhere on the internet there is probably a list of macros to use, ones that will cancel form so you can do things, use pots, etc. Hopefully someone will reply to me with the site and we can all save it for safe keeping. If you're on Windseeker, say hi to Fuzzbutt. Good luck!
---
Sulfuras. Don't know what the balance is exactly but IF is always jam packed and we take over the Kargath and BRM fairly frequently.
---
It’s true that rockbiter has slightly higher DPS, but any shaman using rockbiter in a dungeon is a fool. 
---
The difference is marginal, and more importantly, managing your threat and having the group’s success in mind is a key skill in wow, especially if you ever plan on raiding. Ensuring your tank and healers have an easier time will make your dungeon run go so much faster than the 1% extra dps from running rockbiter.
---
Yup, just like we had transportation vehicles 500 years ago too, just like today in different forms! I bet NOTHING is different right?
---
Countdown to Classic, episode isn’t out yet, but I think it will be quite soon, middle of December ish if Josh the host is fast enough :D
---
spell power is much better
---
It’s been fun, free honor in IF. And when I inevitably die as the idiot warrior charging I’m at least it’s a quick Rez. I haven’t had much problem farming out in the world but I guess that’s because I just assume I’m going to get trained on 1-3 times an hour.
---
You should go through the backdoor, remove gear, die and run as a ghost to your preferred instance entrance.
---
RP in ironforge?
---
also, there's barely a raid worth of alliance in that RP event... if you smack kargath with that it won't be long until you have that sweet 2 min rez timer.
---
Gehennas is actually really good. It's like 60% horde, but none of the alliance guilds are pushovers. Some of the best guilds are on Gehennas to stay and keep on fighting back vs horde.
---
Ummm for having a different opinion? Are you actually serious?
---
WoTLK was garbage too
---
I wouldn't waste the gold on warden staff, just get the maul from DMT
---
Why didn't they make pvp racials equal? Or did they amend that in expansions?
---
I thought trolls were horde?
---
Furries belong in gulag.
---
Orcpeon... what a dumb generic ass name. Has as much intellect as a toaster oven
---
i used my hypnotic blade for long enough into 60 i considered putting +30 on it (witchblade is a myth)
---
Yes! I'm on Grobbulus myself as I am NA, but we each seem to take notice of each other's servers, and ZT seems to be as great of a server as Grob is. If I suddenly packed up and moved to Europe, that would be my choice of server. Best of luck!
---
The problem is they absolutely had changes.  They started with massively overpopulated servers and used layering as a crutch but when removed showed the game was unplayable.  Then they immediately allowed free faction transfers which is another change that exacerbated the issue to the point they killed the server.  
---
If Blizzard had actually launched with enough servers, original population caps, and no panic transfers, this would not be an issue and that would be real "No Changes".
---
You weren't pvp flagged, it's to stop you from accidentally flagging if you use tab.
---
Except if I'm always DoA as Horde.
---
Why am I not always getting a soul shard back when my pet is dismissed when I take a flight path?
---
Curious to see what they do over the next month. They can't seriously expect this to be accepted. I feel like this is a situation like when you were playing with a toy your sibling didn't want so they decide to take it anyways just to piss you off.
---
I haven't healed in vanilla, so I'm not 100% what you should have. My best buddy is a shaman and has like Rank1, mid rank, top rank for some of his.
---
As long as you know you should, you'll figure out whatever works for you :).
---
You're not gonna beat the best rogues/warriors but you can do on par dps with everyone else currently if you put in the effort.
---
Yes, the gnome pops a flame reflector and the 3-minute mage eats a pyro to the face.
---
It's funny.
---
the reason why more server aren't in a flamelash situation is because the transfers are locked.
---
Also, ironically, all those ally transferring created huge imbalance on previously balanced servers (us-earthfury)
---
No no, I agree with your opinion.  You just don't present it in a very socially functional way.
---
You can emote and log off.
---
My "weekend's done" routine in classic was to visit orgrimmar with a paladin buddy, gank a few people and troll the rest, then run into the AH, get DIed and log with my cloak equipped and some time left on the bubble (for the logon).
---
OMG ALLIANCE QUITS BECAUSE HORDE IS TOO GOOD
---
TF? So many different trips to BRM have been Alliance infested corpse runs.
---
That's Upper Blackrock Spire though.
---
Not the person you were asking, but I play on Windseeker as Horde. Nightly we have alliance in Org wrecking and getting rekt, and most nights we're running giant TM/SS battles. It's amazing.
---
Mega Ultra Chicken?  That's just dumb.
---
It is a bug with their batching implementation, if you /stopattack /cast slam /startattack and your autoattack finishes during the cast, both will go off.
---
There's an early access game called Winkeltje thats working up to being a fantastic npc shopkeeper game.  Not much rpg, but managing stock levels and earning reputation for your goods is very enjoyable.
---
Its still pretty raw but its a fun simulator to run now and then.
---
But then consider a prot pally with the armor and stamina as a druid... in PvP. It would be a nightmare,
---
There is the option to gank very popular for both sides  
---
good alternative would be prearranged fights ( thought diminishing return on honor per same person would hurt)  
---
but that would be slow honor gain, and the honor system rewards warry from must ahve to meh to OP ( meaning:  
---
 the 2. rank for that very necessary trinket;  
---
 the 3.rank for extra 10% discount to faction vendors  
---
the 6.ranks give you access to comparably cheep value potions  
---
And for some people the main aim in classic is to get that 14.rank, and the earlier they start the better chances are of obtaining it.  
---
To top it all of- the most effective honor/per hour is also the most ''fuck over the opposite faction''  and bad faction balance or bad pvper balance escalates it even more   
---
( and Blizzards war on ''letting any statistics on populations out'' doesn't help either)  
---
The system was fucked from the moment they decided to have honor system without BGs, and the #nochange fanatics well are no better then any other fanatics  
---
It was a huge mistake when it was first done, and it was a purely moronic to repeat it over and over again, because you know - ''that is how it was''  
---
You could say- ''but some people enjoy it'', and i would say - ''there are some people that enjoy piercing their penis with needles''   
---
but that doesn't really prove that it is a good decision
---
You're welcome
---
\-Me from the boat side
---
said the mage
---
Rag dies, now go slay your gf
---
Earth Shock does more damage if it got a rank up more recently than Frost Shock, and it also serves as an interrupt
---
You would go into your pug raid id.  The rest of the raid would go into the leader's raid id.  Essentially 39 people in the raid leader's id.  You alone in the Tuesday pug raid, with whatever bosses killed dead in that id.
---
&gt;Epic NPC Man
---
I saw a 2 minute video of his content, stolen and slapped onto Facebook. Thanks for telling me who it is! Time to binge.
---
The issue is only one mage in the raid should have iceblock. Most mages are deep arcane for raids because that is what maximizes frostbolt damage. Then one mage is deepfrost for the winter's chill debuff.
---
The people who are gonna play this game aren't quitting. Almost all of them will complain tho. This whole sub is 50% cancer just like the forums that created retail. Anyone who leaves will come back. With no changes or otherwise. Play the game and stay positive...
---
Even better, if you run 1/2 improved fire totems and run engineer, you can do:
---
Nade &gt; Nova totem &gt; em &gt; CL+ ES
---
Currently pops at 300-500 dmg nade, an 700-1k totem, 1600-1800 CL and 1500-1800 ES
---
If the glorious 31/0/20 masterclass had the option to take NS as well, it would become a ludicrous chain of:
---
Nade &gt; Nova &gt; EM &gt; CL &gt; ES &gt; NS &gt; LB
---
Say they all go for mid damage; that's 400, 850, 1700, 1650, and the non-crit batched NS LB drops another 800-1.2k in. 
---
In current gear, right now, you just did 5.5k damage. G fucking G bruh.
---
And I didn't even pop Talisman of Ephemeral for those numbers!
---
Yes, I’ve been trying for SGC. At least 2 sets of 5x/hr (max) runs each night with my geared priest roomate. Have seen Gorosh 8 times with no luck. Is TER&gt;BS? I’ve been going off of the discord’s dps spreadsheet and it has it lower. Can easily equip it as it is in my bag for my pseudo-tank set. 
---
Sounds good, Thanks for that input. Maybe with BG’s I’ll pick up more of an interest again.
---
I'm sure a Shaman can tank Mara but I think your healers will be freaking out for those double Giant pulls before Princess.
---
Man what *isn't* batching fucking up
---
If you don't use the charges, it's the same as having no charges.
---
If you closed it after 30 seconds then I understand how you’d think the entire video is nuking people 1v1. I figured I’d throw in those nuke clips in the “intro” to show the potential damage output. If you actually watched the rest of the video it’s not just 1v1s. Thanks though.
---
Yup, the second they perceive a slight drop in the faction ratio they freak out and make it even worse.  They're more volatile than NASDAQ.
---
it's kind of laughable that you're so emotionally invested that you can't see this behavior is *obviously* tied to the system and population - and not the "baddy" faction
---
It does relate. Do you play the game?
---
Yeah it did lol.
---
You could mask it with mods. But on console it looked terrible.
---
If you're warrior tanking it's still the BiS for sure. If you're going for end game content (or what we have now) the issue is not going to be mitigation, it's going to be threat. Your healers should be able to keep you up. The higher your threat you can produce the more dps your dps members can do. This is why fury prot is popular among end game guilds vs deep prot. This many jam packed stats into one slots frees up your other slots too
---
Yea? I already had it, used it, went back in, farmed boss 5 times an hr and got another?
---
That's hard to believe for you? Must be a vanilla life
---
OoGa BoOga HoRdE nO uNdeRsTanD LoGiC Zug ZuG
---
Zug Zug, we dun fucked it up.
---
They may consider demonshear to be better for humans because it’s a sword. However, if you’re in a raid, I know they won’t appreciate demonshear using a debuff spot for 20dps shadow damage.
---
So playing the class correctly is now getting old on a 15 year old game? No way.
---
Definitely in my top 10 comedies.
---
I think it's fine if they're near immortal as long as they can't do shit for actual damage with the spec.
---
Blizz applied a time limit during BC because previously WSG rounds could last anywhere from 10 minutes to six hours. I think the record is actually 6 hours and 57 minutes. It sounds epic but I never had a fun round of WSG that lasted more than 30 minutes.
---
Usually it was a permanent stalemat, or the FC was a cancerous bastard and go out of bounds. worst was gy camping
---
Exactly my experience. Regret not choosing a pve server every time I play. Can’t wait for paid transfers to gtfo the server.
---
when tbc came out orc became the master race for both pvp and pve (I believe hardieness was changed from 25% to 15% stun resist but was still decent). Blood Fury was changed to increase spell power and attack power (inculded range attack power), so orc warlocks and hunters became godlike with a free +dmg racial. Blood elves were good because mana tap helped oom casters faster and in pvp that was incredibly helpful, and their arcane torrent was really solid as well. Overall, they were probably second best for pvp behind orc and undead who were equally op. For pve they added race locked paladins which really pushed horde to be the strongest faction for that expansion
---
Yes I am having a good time. While I don't enjoy getting zerged down and the frustration that comes with it, I have made a ton of really good friends in game.
---
And that is going to be furthered by BG's soon, doing premades and enjoying more competitive pvp.
---
It was never as much as 0.3%, it was 0.1% before 1.12, and it was changed to 0.2%. having many many times more people metagaming and going for rank 14 won't make it easier when it's just twice as many spots.
---
Well, wrong but thanks anyways.
---
Hi, /u/newtoreddit0694
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e74ntg/blue_man_good_red_man_bad/). 
---
So when I was doing the honor grind back in the day, we wouldn't always AFK out against other premades.  Since our 'warlord group' had a monopoly on honor on our server, we could take the occasional time for an epic 1 hour WSG against the Alliance Marshal group on our server just so they knew we could destroy if we wanted to.
---
Most of the time we'd just afk out because our server was lopsided in favor of alliance, horde had instant queues, so we'd give the Allies the win - they had 5-10 minutes qeues and we'd just requeue into some plebs to murder.
---
As the EA CEO would say - surprise mechanics.
---
Reroll. Leveling is the best part of classic
---
Bracket 2 (the top 0.8%) makes just enough to fight off the decay and stay in the same position at rank 13. You can't progress to 14 without being bracket 1 at least 5 times.
---
&gt; Increased pop cap is not something which has caused a horrible problem,
---
I cant believe anyone would write this and actually believe it......
---
That is a myth that was perpetuated by their rarity. Many servers only saw one per week at the most, but it was never a limit.
---
You're right, only one *should* have Ice Block. However, I seem to be the only mage I've seen specced Arcane-Frost. Everyone else is deep Frost while I'm popping arcane power and critting for 2.2k
---
See, you get mad and you get even. But what I love most about phase 2, is now I’m making friends outside of dungeons. I run with a pug PVP group and find myself in the same group later on. Or, I’m running to school and get saved by someone I saved a few days ago. I’m hoping wpvp dies down a LITTLE when bgs drop,  it I know it won’t. 
---
Premades are gonna be great. Having a rag day, ony day, and a AV day are gonna be fun.
---
&gt; What I said is that "the size of raids against an enemy faction's city aren't based on a % of the population".
---
Yes, I know. Its the same thing. Youre saying server pop size doesnt effect the size of people doing a given activity. Its a really goofy argument to try and make, but youre welcome to it! Good luck.
---
I blame the seller, hands down.
---
The Taurens in Mulgore also just want to live with Nature, but Dwarves insist on excavating there. Same with the Frostwolf clan.
---
One side isn't "the good guys". It's a nuanced conflict where both factions do plenty of good things and plenty of bad things.
---
I see hunter skill hasn't changed much in 15 years.
---
Oh I assumed holy water was just mana drink.
---
I've noticed that. Same with my friends were so gun ho on PvP non RP servers when i knew i wouldn't like wPvP and thought RP would be interesting. Now all my friends have stopped since hitting 60. I am rerolling on PvE server now
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7067
---
those sham cleave groups usually take rogues too since you benefit from windfury also
---
im a rogue and never really had a problem joining these groups leveling up
---
This makes a lot more sense.
---
Some people are allergic to making money.
---
Not sure, this might be a screenshot from Retail .....
---
If I remember correctly most top teams in tbc were undead when available because wotf was not tied to trinket cd. Wrath flipped to human because of every man for himself being a free trinket so you could stack a pve trinket for more damage.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain#comments
---
Top comment here is gold too.
---
They changed it to a dispel because the AoE silence was broken in M+ dungeons.
---
Then they added a billion dispel-able mechanics to the raids and dungeons for some reason. 🤔
---
I'm alliance and I get lost trying exit  Aerie Peak.
---
Hmm...i like the 1v1 skirmishes but getting ganked over and over by 60s because I'm 50 is no fun. Nothing i can do about it really. I just /dance and let them have their way and hope they let me quest lol.
---
Hes 100% correct.
---
Only troll here is you.
---
They equalize things a bit in TBC by giving humans a much better pvp racial.
---
"you people", again you are acting like a spoiled child. People in this game break up into small communities and have little to zero interaction with other communities. All you have to do is find a guild that is closely in line with your current beliefs and make it your home.
---
Despite this you are trying to lump a majority of the community into a single mindset, label that mindset and bad "in your opinion" and then explain how that is hurting the game as a whole.....
---
If you think gimping yourself on purpose and remaining ignorant to mechanics that most of us learned 15 years ago, will make the game an overall better place to play, you are sadly mistaken and likely unhappy playing the game and in your personal life.
---
Stop trying to influence others method of playing at all and find like minded people to play with.
---
I will say the alliance has a lot fewer “go slaughter the Horde” quests than vice versa. Coming from someone who has 60s on both sides.
---
What about fire resistance?
---
Brb rerolling
---
&gt;Mats should run somewhere around 700g 
---
12 bars and 10 sapphires is closer to 1200g on my server
---
Blizz just f'd up by not releasing a better honor farming tool, Bg's 1 week would have been okay with wpvp. but in week 2 there should have been a bg.
---
&gt; Youre saying server pop size doesnt effect the size of people doing a given activity.
---
Again, that's not what I'm saying. What I said regarding the number of people participating in any given activity is that "If I want to raid something, I'll see how many people we can get and if we don't have enough for Org, we'll settle for something smaller."
---
Have you got no reading comprehension, or are you simply happier when you're arguing with yourself? I mean, if that's what you like to do, I can just step out and let you reply to yourself...
---
Again, if I was twisting your words like you're doing mine, I'd be saying you're arguing that if a "full" server raids MC with 40 people per raid, then a "half full" server raids MC with 20 people per raid.
---
I see there's a lot of ignorant people here who choose to live in the dark and ignore the truth
---
Still trying to decide if a euphemism is hiding in there somewhere.
---
Zandalar
---
He was 1 of 5 backpeddling hunters I killed today. Who's training these people?!
---
Why is it good for paladins over other classes?
---
But the bottom percentiles are liable to be proportionally larger. Anyone who gets a handful (20? idr) of HKs gets entered into the system as a participant, and the huge amount of casual PvPers may skew the numbers. It's all speculation at this point.
---
&gt; I run with a pug PVP group and find myself in the same group later on.
---
Well this is the nature of classic, things are a lot more tight-knit. As myself I have multiple small groups I run with every day, 2-3 people along with myself makes for really interesting fights. 3v8? Sure, not the most fun but seeing the screen pop up with 6 or all 8 kills is really fun.
---
There isnt a lot you can do. Try to keep your pet out of nova range for spell pushback.
---
He pointed you to wowclassicpopulation.com which has up to date server counts. You posted an aggregation article from before Phase 2 even dropped, clearly not relevant anymore given the current PvP problems.
---
I choose to see the servers _half full_ thank you very much.
---
Right?!?!
---
My absolute favorite raid set up or ONY is warrior MT (me) and bear druid tank on adds. It works SO well
---
Probably a GM...
---
Of course getting ganked sucks, I get ganked a lot too. Nothing you can really do, but if you can just grind dungeons.
---
No they are not forcing them to no life it.  You could get there, it will just take you longer than the absolute minimum, you are missing the point.  If you don't want to put in the time and do it, you don't get it.  Blizzard doesn't owe you ANYTHING.  You basically just want it easier, which everyone's response has been, go back to retail if you want easy instance gratification for your work.  You rub some brain cells together and stop thinking you deserve everything a game has just because you want it but don't want to work for it.
---
Surely you could get 10-15 people pushing to make each an alt eligible for bracket 1 each week. Over a few groups that would get you your minimum number.
---
I hope it helps, its a very simplified example as there are an infinite number of factors in real fights, but the point still stands. It also illustrates the point of why the bigger the fight gets the more unwinnable it is, even if the % is the same at the start.
---
Even if the lesser side has some sick flank with sappers and nukes 50 enemies instantly, each enemy they killed is far less of a % of the overall damage which means their side is far more stable and able to handle losses.
---
Unsub and put that as the reason. Unsubbing is the only way they will listen.
---
The freshstart launch of an MMO is always the funniest when everyone starts at Lvl 1 and there is competition leveling is great
---
Heyheyheyheyhey alliance is doing just fine with the numbers they have. Incendious horde here. To be clear I agree with OP, I love my server and want it to be as balanced as possible but no body should get the idea that alliance are having a hard time. They are organized and they are pissed and they control a hell of a lot of zones in both kalimdor and EK. I’m actually really happy with the server I picked, My alt gets killed like a lot but I’m not seeing any issues that you’d think to find when reading this sub...
---
I play alliance on Skeram. Those 20 man Alliance raids certainly exist.  Shit I myself sat outside and terrorized Kargath for like 4 hours the other day.  Not only that, but I have entered MC twice a week(main and alt raid) since release with only being wiped once. We have wiped horde, Onslaught in particular, MUCH more than they have wiped us. I also partake in SOLO open world pvp. I'm currently in top 100 standing alliance side playing almost exclusively solo. I've also farmed almost exalted with Timbermaw in winter spring during this time. The game is playable. Absolutely playable. It is just different than what it used to be. Adapt, overcome, and embrace this new wow classic experience. And if all else fails re-roll on a PVE server. Pvp servers may not be for you.
---
Same thing happens to horde.  Sometimes it takes me 15-20 minutes just go out of the pass from Kargath to Searing gorge, and the graveyard is literally right next to town.
---
sure it pushes people to do it.  But you'd think people would realize what effect they're "PvP" has.  I love PvP its good fun.  What I don't care for is the insane griefing.  I was dead in EPL for 3 hours last night, after the 1st 20 minutes I was worth 0 honor to the same 10 people that stayed their killing me for the next 2.5 hours.  That's not PvP and it's not getting anyone honor, it's blatant griefing and makes people want to move to different communities.
---
How are you getting to gadgetzen without flying?
---
Thorns is huge especially on AOE pulls. When I have thorns, ret aura and nagelring on 35% of my damage as a bear comes form those 3 effects. More like 40% if you have improved thorns/ret aura.
---
why should I join a casual guild? I'm in a raiding guild, and enjoying. I just dont want BWL released next week, and ZG in 3-4 weeks, with AQ40 in Jan and Naxx by March. 
---
I want the game spread out. Its my choice. I liked vanilla wow, and want to enjoy it without it being rushed out with all content out in 6 months from release.
---
Yeah, they needed to open up free transfers from any PvP realm to Flamelash for Alliance characters, and free transfers off for Horde
---
EMFH didn't come till wrath. Horde &gt; alliance in BC because paladins are the entire reason Alliance are the stronger pvp faction in vanilla, and Horde gets paladins in BC
---
If they launched with original population caps TONS of servers would be dead by now and they'd have way more server transfers than you have now.
---
You can hut rank 14 in 2nd backet, its just slow.
---
I ve played on Nost, Elysion, the Lightbringer, Dalaran wow , fenix bc etc .... and yes. Alliance will have instant queue and horde will have 5-15 min queue time.
---
Scholo is extremely easy, I’m a warlock and 3 man full clear the entire dungeon with a disc priest and fire mage. The loot and $$$ is outstanding.
---
&gt; The mongols waged a bloody campaign of conquest across Asia
---
And the middle east and eastern Europe too.
---
&gt;They raped, pillaged, enslaved, and murdered everywhere they went.
---
Only if you surrender (&amp; pay tribute) when given the chance. Once you raise arms against them, it's kill or be killed, no mercy.
---
An extra trinket slot.
---
Which is all the work of Onyxia.
---
These kids have no idea hahahaha get ready for the crying
---
I love it, makes pvp realms dangerous and always on your feet. It’s nice you don’t lose anything but time when you die.
---
God why would you do this to yourself
---
Players do go to far, as to continue to camp people for hours after they're worth no honor.
---
“I’m out” lol
---
That's...exactly what I'm saying? Adding players at the same rate to both factions will not result in one faction winning more often.
---
Could you explain how slam should be used in a 2H fury rotation.
---
Roll any other server and to get the same experience, from level 20 onwards simply have a friend wait for you to log on before disconnecting your internet and spitting in your face.
---
There’s nothing fun about what players have done on those realms.
---
stay max range and mana drain them. If they blink on your scattershot / trap and reset. If they instantly pop ice block then you need to follow it up with a nade or something
---
Brackets are bottom-up not top-down. Without the minimum number of people (300ish?) rank 14 never opens.
---
I was thinking of Every Man for Himself. But it seems I was wrong it it was added in WotLK.
---
Pretty sure that effect is gone when you change form.
---
Question for fury warrior raiders. A few questions actually.
---
When is the optimal time to use DW/Recklessness during boss fights, as well as consumables such as mighty rage pots?
---
Also, I’m running devilsaur set and both dalrends but recently I got core hound tooth and got the skill level to ~297. I was wondering if it would be wise to drop 2% hit and 30 atk power to use dalrend mh/cht and edgemasters handguards.  I am a dwarf warrior.
---
It's okay to help someone realise they are wrong with facts and empathy. You don't have to hang it over them.
---
Sometimes there isnt a smart way
---
MC/Ony is significantly easier than 10+ keys or mythic EP.
---
Wait.... So that's not a legit course of action?
---
We do the same on Skeram as well.  The people complaining here are just the ones that can't figure it out.
---
You can though
---
Mmmm the alliance between the orcs, humans, and night elves was always sort of tenuous. When daddy Proudmoore showed up to get clapped by Rexxar that kind of shot the orc-human relations to high hell, and considering that most of the common citizens probably never had any love for each other even when they were allied it's not surprising to me that horde-alliance relations didn't really work out.
---
It's easy to think that WC3 was the story of building a grand alliance between the races, but really it's the story of Thrall, Jaina, and Malfurion forging an alliance together which due to the political realities of their respective polities they were unable to maintain.
---
The problem is you find out real quick that queuing for a bg at popular twink brackets while leveling doesn't produce fun results. Health pools are insane on twinks, relative to their level. The higher the bracket, the less commonplace twinks become.
---
Same here.
---
I can't explain this enough to people. It's BiS. People age too hung up on item color.
---
Are you on Sulfuras??
---
I wanted to be UD for canibalize on my destro lock ..... but i am human because of instant BG queue.
---
Indeed good sir
---
Exactly. I wanted to hear some positives out of phase 2, I know a lot of people rolled pvp for the “classic experience” but did anyone consider that that experience was just those who rolled pvp back in the day? I knew what I was getting into, because I played vanilla. But like my buddies who joined during cata, they hardly touch the game now lol.
---
That's not really the perception at all. In dungeons, bear tank is 100% welcomes. In raids, bear tank is usually welcomed. We've had bear tanks MT all of MC. It'll become less accepted in later raids but atm you can do every piece of content.
---
Is it possible to safely Ice Block/Divine Shield the Living Bomb debuff when fighting Baron Geddon without exploding the raid?
---
Nope none yet since it only happened a couple of days ago
---
But it was slightly horde leaning but still plenty balanced, then mass alliance influx from Flamelash, then a bunch of horde from flamelash followed
---
From the news I've read it hasn't skewed the population too far either way yet
---
Envy scum 
---
Sincerely,
---
Marzbarz &lt;Envy&gt;
---
I'm free to genocide as I please? Well if you insist, cowman.
---
Mortal strike is a medium-low priority debuff that only replaces DoTs that are under 10 seconds.
---
That doomguard is legit. 
---
Ps: no one to blame but yourself.
---
That applies to small numbers, sure. When one of five players goes down, the odds change more significantly. This would support claims of a problem if there were only 10 people on the server. That's not what we're talking about though, is it? The more players involved, the MUCH less significant losing one player becomes.
---
However, ignoring the extremes, if you can put 1.5 allies against every 1 enemy, the result will be similar whether we're talking about 40 v 60 or 40,000 v 60,000. Again, simple math.
---
Look up the lore of the Tauren and defias brotherhood. The alliance is imperialist.
---
arms sucks for raiding and dual wield can take advantage of the heroic strike bug so that makes sense he would lose that much dmg.
---
That's awful. You're going to have to live with that for the rest of your life, man.
---
I use it as a Combat Rogue and it is almost always proc'd. Love it.
---
yeah there are only reactive mechanics in Mc. You know when something is coming but nothing changes.
---
Oh jk just realized you said shazz and youre OP. Im horde and did that with an alliance on my server in Hinterlands lol
---
Please stop with this bullshit. You are playing other human beings and you know it. Greifing is a shitty move in any game and there are *always* story/theme reasons about why it’s ok.
---
They’re treating fellow gamers like shit for their own enjoyment. Just own it and stop pretending the actions of such people are anything but their own.
---
I'd advice getting a palette and a painting board.
---
Server merges would solve that issue.  Really the massive population could have been fine but they had no plans for faction balance, no faction queues, locked character creation, literally anything.  Then they made it massively worse allowing transfers with no faction restriction which in all examples in the past results in the lower population faction transferring off in droves.
---
All in all it's just one bad decision after another.  I'm comfy on incendius though so still happy for now.
---
Horde. And Horde always outnumbers on raid days when Alliance is running into MC, but sure, 60/40 is totally "living the dream".
---
Can always do the whole "everyone queue all at once. did we all get the queue pop? cool lets go!" strategy
---
Yes you are right - I was mistaken.
---
I know exactly what I've said all thread long, you obviously don't.
---
You keep saying I said things I never said and calling those things I never said wrong. This is so absurd I don't even know where to start, so yeah, I'm out.
---
In the off chance that you have some sort of epiphany, here's, yet again, what I've said regarding this subject matter. See if you can understand, this time around.
---
&gt; the size of raids against an enemy faction's city aren't based on a % of the population
---
&gt;  If I want to raid something, I'll see how many people we can get and if we don't have enough for Org, we'll settle for something smaller.
---
I'm not sure why you're completely unable to understand those two very simple sentences.
---
People are dumb if they truly think horde and alliance will have equal queue times ahha
---
Most Horde are backpeddling scum as soon as the Alliance start pumping them. Hope you close line many more until they leave for their PvE servers.
---
Good old AR! 
---
If anyone needs a tank on alliance side hit me up.
---
Marzbarz
---
I prefer Big Wigs. It is less intrusive.
---
Damn, I guess queues at peak time is low pop lol.
---
No lol you really are missing the point.
---
SWG: Classic would be fun
---
Yea but with only an hour a day to play its gonna take OP far to long to accomplish anything. Like 50-60 is almost entirely dungeon running and if this guy only has an hour to play everyday then idk how he's done any dungeons while leveling besides parts of SM. He's literally never gonna finish BRD, Spire or DM or Scholo because they all take at least an hour to complete. Because of that he probably won't ever aquire any pre-raid bis which in turn means he probably wont ever raid. So essentially a large portion of the leveling/dungeon content and the end game is completely off limits to him. With only an hour each day to play essentially the only thing OP can do is quest and certain BGs. This isnt the game for them and some of these people who dont have at least 3-4 hours per day to play need to realize this and find another game already instead of just complaining about it and trying to get classic turned into retail
---
Maybe you're just an easy target.  I play alli on skeram as well.  I was one of the first people to hit 60.  I now have 2 more 60s.  Never had any real issues.  Got ganked a few times here and there, but that's normal.  Someone tries to camp you?  Go get a glass of water.  Go use the bathroom.  Buy invisible pots.  There are solutions.  Just because you cannot play the game exactly how you want it to be does not mean the game is unplayable.
---
What are you talking about, we're getting battlegroups on the 10th so they'll have no problem being eligible to get rank 14
---
Oh no, you mean the run from the lava to BRD takes 3, maybe 4, deaths?
---
Lol, a good run from Thorium Point into BRM, on off-hours, is ~7 deaths. Then you have to get through the tunnel, and down/up to whatever instance you're going to.
---
I will be honest I never watched your videos, cause I just don't watch many videos on Reddit.  But I always was excited to see you post another dungeon video.  The post are a refreshing change of pace from much of the content here, and honestly the fact you could play with your son just made me fell happy.  I wish you many more gaming adventures with you children.
---
Similar concept. Shamans bring utility. Grace of Air is permanently down for 4% crit to your party. Strength of Earth for extra strength, resist totems, etc. Can switch to a 2h(Slavedrivers Cane) and do the job of a typical Enh as well if need be. 
---
Brings your own personal tremor totem and grounding totem for appropriate encounters.
---
You could say other specs do this too but people say the same about Druids and its a garbage argument. Classic is group based so you can never have too much utility if you build your groups right.
---
In terms of personal mitigation I urge you to check out caperfins guide for exact numbers as he does actually compare Shamans to Bear tanks. While they cant match the health pool they can match your other mitigation stats on top of 10% reduced fire/nature/frost damage and a 6 second (5 if talented) on demand interrupt. 
---
Very anti magic, which is a Shaman tanks niche.
---
Soon as paid character transfers open we're gone. Everyone I know is raid logging now or playing on different servers.
---
Yea Im not buying the "Oh we did a bunch of bad stuff but a little good so it cancels out".
---
When bt is on cd and the swing timers time remaining is less than slam cast time. 
---
/stopattack 
---
/cast slam
---
I'm just sitting here thinking that both sides can field at least 2 full raids at which point the lag wins and all bets are off for which side wins.
---
Wait what? This is literally people playing the game correctly. You just don't like it because you're losing.
---
OK, so say your raid group all presses join new AV at the same second. 15 players get into the same instance and join.  That is what I, put forth in so many words.  
---
What do you do to have the best chance of winning for your side?  
---
I am horde so I am really curious what the options are.
---
Stuff like this was much less common in vanilla because the overall population was growing the whole time. New players would have kept servers like this alive. There are no new players in classic. Anyone who wanted the nostalgia kick was there at the start.
---
I think it's just more pronounced from alliance players complaining because of more PvP servers are Horde favored.  from what ive seen ally seems to dominate most PvE pvp.
---
That's also dumb
---
Man, I need a poster of this!
---
I've never played on a dead server. Think I'm going to create a dwarf and head to IF just to see what it's like
---
Your opinion is already biased. Calling the game a dumpster fire. Reply again months down the road and we will find out. Far more people are just playing and enjoying the game.
---
huh. You sure? When feared or sapped, I'm unable to use any abilities.
---
Damn that's a sick power word shield tracker. Is that a WA? I'm not even a priest and I want it lol.
---
Bingo. The limiting factor in classic has always been threat generation.
---
Yea but with only an hour a day to play its gonna take you far to long to accomplish anything. Like 50-60 is almost entirely dungeon running and if you only have an hour to play everyday then idk how you've done any dungeons while leveling besides parts of SM.

With only an hour each day to play, essentially the only thing you can do is quest and certain BGs. This isnt the game for you and you and some of these other casual players who dont have at least 3-4 hours per day to play need to realize this and find another game already instead of just complaining about it and trying to get classic turned into retail
---
Sure it’s just a game but people’s time is very valuable and a 20days /played time investment that people have is fucking huge. If you value your time at $15 an hour, thats worth $7200 USD of your time.
---
I listed the USD conversion to show how important people’s time actually is.
---
Good question. Unknown AFAIK. Hopefully they keep battlegroups in.
---
It is even worse than on private servers since private servers had chili overtuned. You have to spend several hundred gold and several hours getting buffs just to be bottom dps in raids. In PvP you can win certain 1v1s, but you are almost always better off playing support in a group. Only way you will kill other players in a reasonable amount of time is blowing a ton of gold on engi items.
---
Pagle definitely isn't low pop lol
---
You're probably right lmao
---
Dont go before you do your research. You will get not only yourself killed, but possibly wipe the raid.
---
I don't get angry about it and try to just go with the flow, but I do have some complaints. I wouldn't say I especially enjoy phase 2. 
---
What I don't like is that people aren't willing to help you. I can get camped/ganked in Gadget 10 times and no one will come to my aid. PVP groups only invite 60s and never respond to my request to join a group. I'm 53. I also don't like how people abuse deadspots where guards don't get triggered. I also don't like how i'm always ganked my mages or rogues and never other classes. I can't do much against them as a warrior. Also ever since phase 2 started, i've never 1v1 a horde near my level. It's usually 2+ level 60s coming at me.
---
If you logout or force close the game. Are you still in when you relog
---
I still don't understand why they allowed alliance to transfer off already imbalanced servers.
---
Whooooo cares neck beards
---
Lmao it is how it's supposed to be played. This is what happens when ultra competitiveness takes over and the casuals don't bother listening to everyone that warned them that this would happen. It like the meme with the guy shoving a stick in his bike tire and then blaming everyone else when he falls.
---
Unrelated, but how they heck did you get 600g on a level 10?
---
Thank you. It's okay with me if you haven't watched our videos. Like I tell my sons regarding our gaming time together: If you're interested, great, but if you're not interested, that's okay, too. Never feel like you have to. Only play with me if you want to.
---
making the cry babys quit and transfer makes the victory even sweeter :D 
---
run instead of face ur challenge head on :D
---
I forgot how long it takes to get into groups, travel to the instance, etc.  So being in my 40's now and only having up to an hour each night I have had to find other ways to enjoy the game.  So currently farming gold for epic mount, which is an achievement my vanilla character took much longer to achieve.
---
Completely agree.  This sub is garbage now.  99% of this sub is bad Alliance players who rolled on PVE servers and are mad that they are getting killed.  I have 3 level 60 alli on Skeram.  I don't experience any of these reported issues.  There are ways around all of this.  40 horde in BRM?  Take the back entrance.  Run a different dungeon.  Buy invisible pots.  I can tell you personally all of these things people are saying horde are doing....I do as alliance myself.
---
Kind friends
---
This publicity will bring enough people to the server who think they can get easy ranks already in low level. And it may actually work. They will have the minimum amount of people for sure.
---
Wahhhhhhhhh in Alliance.
---
That's not even close to what happened. A more apt analogy would be you signed up for a job that promised 40 hour work weeks, great benefits, and a good atmosphere. Then you get there and everyone is working 60+ hours a week, morale is dead, and its nothing like you expected.
---
Literally not a single person who rolled a PvP server wanted to be spawn killed repeatedly because one server had a 90-10 faction imbalance. Nor should that have ever been considered a possibility. Blizzard royally mismanaged world pvp and faction balance to the point some servers are dead because of it.
---
I think the best bet is to enlist osme guildies and engage him at the bottom of the map.
---
0/21/31 would be soooo good for pvp, elemental with ice barrier so good
---
We used three, two priests and a druid, and covered the Bay. Called out on discord when (and where) we'd found pools.
---
In one instance, I was on the ruined building and had fished out the pool 16 minutes before. The druid finished fishing out the pool south of Scalebeard's cave, which was his last "sweep" between the central points.
---
The pool then re-spawned shortly after right in front of me, well off the 1-hour timer. I then fished it out, and the Priest noted that a spawn had just happened at the SE island. We attempted to verify a third time, but this was interrupted by Horde appearing on the scene.
---
Wowhead guides is shit. 
---
It's good weapon.
---
It is yea...I play a rogue and the best way for me to farm honor is killing afk people in cities or flightpoints, really not enjoyable. 
---
Roaming as a rogue is kind of impossible due to the horrific render distance. Can't stealth without them seeing me and popping every shield/consumable/etc they have. Plus there are only groups of horde around. So back to Kargath I go and camp afk people yay...
---
US had to ally with Russia in WW2. Doesn't mean they agreed to how they ran their country.
---
holy shit, that's pure /r/ihadastroke material.
---
If you loved WoW before, you'll love it again. There is literally no game I've played in the last 15 years that has filled the hole that was left when they destroyed WoW with the Cata-prepatch. This game is great! Also, if you roll Alliance on Westfall, PM me and I'll get you in with my guild. We have MC/Ony on farm, people with new alts they are leveling and even new people leveling for the first time. It's great!
---
The one that surprised me the most was the quest where you send to murder dryads in Ashenvale, not because  they're attacking, not because they're invading horde's territory, you kill them so you can get their hair and sew yourself a robe. If that's not fucking evil, i don't know what is.
---
There are a decent bunch of us that do, feel free to send me a whisper next time Im on
---
Raiding guilds can be casual. I just understood that you wanted to play casually, I mean raiding is only once per week, doesn't really get more casual than that :D 
---
We have 1 casual raid and 1 performance raid per week in our guild, I guess it depends on how big the guild is and how it is decided who gets to join the raid. 
---
Seeing as battlegrounds are coming soon I think and hope they will probably release BWL around feb-march which would only be 1-2 months faster than originally.
---
That's the one I was waiting for.
---
They actually aren't, the core of that guild has been raiding on retail for years from what I've heard, but I see the connection ;)
---
Server merges are basically server transfers, only instead of giving people the option of moving to X server you tell them they're being forced to X server (which I might add is a decision that will also upset some snowflakes). If you had original cap sizes you'd have dozens and dozens of servers that would need merges instead of just a handful right now which is much easier to manage.
---
Had to tell off a few allies from griefing that shit, im a warlock running herbalism routes in silithus, and whenever I see someone doing it ill give some help unless i have lotus timer.
---
Warpath is the Alli version of Mind Games.
---
Iceblock+POM would be nice. 
---
Deathwish/Mortal Strike is definitely going to be the most OP.
---
My simple man's dream would just be the ability to have 11/11/31 on a pally.  Would it be OP as fuck? No, it wouldn't, but it would let me have consecrate, bokings, and still get repentance.
---
It's not just wowhead, of the multiple guides I've seen I think they all fail to even mention it.
---
Well most people on this sub are both bad at the game and didn’t actually play Vanilla, so what did you expect?
---
shrug
---
Grats horde now you’re a pve server
---
I’ve enjoyed playing on my main, but I haven’t been able to play on my alt at all.
---
Wrong. It's like signing up for a job that everyone is telling you sucks but you're like "no this is a good idea". Then when you're wrong you blame everyone else because you didn't listen.
---
&gt; should that have ever been considered a possibility
---
Literally all of reddit was warning you of this. It's not their fault you were too dumb to listen.
---
You seem alright, so ima give you some advice, 5 expansions from now don't show up to undercity.
---
With how dumb you are, I’m amazed you were actually able to put together a couple sentences and figure out how to post them
---
The downside of leveling phase 2. Youre at that sweet spot of honor worthy. My advice is to find a good guild that’s going to come help you. When I pvp with my guild, it’s usually to save a lower level guild member. 
---
There’s no honor in 2v1 on a lower level. I’ll tell ya that much, but people will only learn that when they aren’t ranking as fast as they think they should be.
---
One of the books, Before the Storm
---
Not if they put all servers in the same pool, and certainly not to the degree they would if it was not cross server.
---
I'd love for them to drop in the 10th, but the blizz statement didn't confirm thre 10th. It said the week of the 10th. So next week is confirmed,  next week tuesday is not.
---
Wait until Dec 10 then find some obscure out of the way mobs somewhere. I heard of a turtle island once.
---
&gt;I think lorewise, they wouldn't have been accepted into the Horde (Thrall didn't want them afaik), if not for the tauren, who took mercy on them and wanted to research and cure their condition
---
How is that going, btw?  Was this another plot point that got dropped several expansions ago or are the Tauren still actively trying to find a cure?  And would the Forsaken even want to be cured?
---
At least it was in BC and not current content. They're both pretty wild though.
---
I'm gonna have to ask which addons you use. Your setup is beautiful, specially the name plate auras.
---
When bgs drop you’ll be useful. Until then, leave my horde buddies alone. ;D
---
Source?
---
Thank you, exactly the answer I’m looking for.
---
I read "Stand As One" once as being a potentially new Alliance rallying cry. It's way too far gone to ever take off, but I thought it worked really well.
---
Rattlegore
---
Bring a bottle of vodka.....drink the bottle of vodka, wipe the raid.................GO PARTAY!!!
---
Saw some heartbreaking stuff assisting this quest at like 4 in the morning. 4 ally hunters and 2 horde hunters all take turns on it while i debuff them, one horde hunter kills it after the other fails, but then starts to emote /cry etc. then the other hunter goes to loot the demon and hearths out. 
---
The guy who managed the kill stays back for another hour trying to get the kill, but fails every time and is obviously out of consumables. 
---
Heard from a guildie of his over discord they didnt know about the loot priority thing.
---
I didnt say they dont exist. I said they are rare. And I solo and PvP when I can and do just fine. When the numbers are close to even, yes we tend to win more than we lose. Congrats on your top 100 time spent PvPing achievement. That's super neat
---
Dunno, may be because there no items with mace skill.
---
You can profit off your Mooncloth cooldown
---
The undead are miles worse than any alliance race. If anything the Orcs and Humans should make amends to ally against the forsaken. 
---
Second, to avoid real politics and keep it in the spirit of the game, when two genocidal maniacs are fighting each other, the best thing to do is to stand aside, let them beat each other down, then when one finally kills the other, step in and take that one out too.
---
Cool story,  you know it doesn't actually work tho right?
---
Lmao whine more. You have plenty of time now that you can't rez on the PvP server you were told not to play on if you didn't want to get camped.
---
You mean in 4 days when he likely still won't be 60 yet anyway?
---
There needs to be a square for “premises are ruining the game”
---
I think pagle has more alliance players than any other server period. Or it's close atleast
---
Some of us are still leveling so appart from STV shenigans we're not really taking part in WPvP
---
Before bfa.
---
Wtf is this UI
---
In order, from best to worst, (1) gnome, (2) dwarf, (3) tauren, (4) troll, (5) orc, (6) night elf [if male NE didn’t exist, NE would be fourth, but the male NE models are just awful], (7) undead, (8) human
---
No, I’m not. Elemental fire goes for like 6 on my server, and OP literally said they go for 10 on theirs.
---
If you have 10+ coordinated people you can go straight for the jugular and kill Vanndar with four marshals up. Win immediately.
---
I don't think Premades will be as big of an issue as everyone is making it out to be. Yes they will be more prevalent than Vanilla but they won't be nearly as common as Private servers.
---
immediate gkick. 
---
If you cant beat the quest turnin boss, you cant beat raid bosses.
---
If I were you I'd roll dwarf to go daggers.  Being able to restealth with a bleed is sexy af.
---
But if you're in love with human animations, ignore the above.
---
The thing is, im having a hard time believing that it will completly stop. But i guess thats my only option....
---
Yess i switched to mograine.. its terrible on skullflame
---
It actually is. There was a post of this week in WoW with battlegrounds listed for the 10th.
---
Until Grom killed Mannaroth and ya know, "severed their ties."
---
&gt;that's potentially 500g (equivalency) you could buy the Perdition's Blade for and not be at a loss
---
I'd buy Perdition's Blade for 500g in a heartbeat, but I think they would ask for 5000g, not 500.
---
lmao so your basically saying they should just take the D and like it so you can continue to grief?
---
Without special gear?  I don’t think you can hold threat off 900+ dps without going fury prot and having a ton of threat gear like LHH, SGC, etc which wouldn’t have traditionally been considered standard tank gear even 2 years ago on older private servers, let alone actual Vanilla
---
I hate it that the pets stay blue, give me free rage please.

The worst part of phase 2 was logging in here to see if there was any news and seeing 17 threads about how pvp was happening on their pvp server. I'm on a pvp server, people murder one another; news at 11.
---
I doubt it. It would still just be people running around in deathballs. Maybe every now and then you'll get like a nice 10v10 but it will be so rare. Not to mention once it does happen, one side will just start summoning more people in making it skewed again.
---
Trollolol,

Man for 15 years everyone has been wrong. I guess an ability that can only be used by 1 specific class/race combination cancels out an ability that can be used by almost half of the horde players, sounds about right. I guess resisting 1/4 stuns is alright, I guess resisting a kidney shot and winning a dual for free 1/4th the time is an ok racial. Perception ROFL, you can easily play around it by either hiding for 10 seconds OR running into them and stunning them anyways... Stone form to break blind? Escape artist for all the gnomes warriors/rogues... People do play gnome warrior right? Dam alliance have it so good.
---
I love running around out of shadowform to bait people before I melt their face.
---
Rewording the other response a bit, if you log out with a pet out, when you log back in you will not get a soul shard if your pet is desummoned, whether that is through range or a flight path or whatever.

Do you now realize he's full of shit and draws ridiculous conclusions that support his own bias?
---
Because all of the addons which actually efficiently let you sort through/filter/order items by price (since the default UI is useless for this) require you to wait for them to scan every single auction.
---
If there are 20 pages worth of auctions bscause everyone is posting them 1 per stack instead of 20 per stack, it takes a long time to buy stuff.
---
Without using addons the search time isnt increased but it would be insanely time-consuming to find the actual best deal because the only sort blizzard gives you is starting price (and it's not per unit).
---
And we just want their skulls to decorate our homes. Different strokes...
---
I think that would depend on the forsaken
---
Sorry alliance losers 
---
You Lost.
---
Nuff said.
---
Ur thinking of retail.
---
No it's not the same dynamic and most people would be happy others bit the bullet not them.
---
There are usually only a few mages deep frost for winter’s chill that includes enough points for ice block. Most of the mages will be 31/20 arcane frost for arcane power.
---
Just type in your server name into warcraft logs website. That'll give you a pretty good idea.
---
Lol ya I'm sure this server is super fun to play on as Horde.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/rankings/5036/1000#metric=speed
---
Saw this on the Skeram discord and it made me think of all the posts about Flamelash. I guess we are lucky that it isn't that bad yet, but there's still a pretty striking disparity.
---
I think we were fortunate that during the last round of transfers a number of major guilds decided to stay, otherwise Skeram would have turned out that way. It may still turn out that way, when paid transfers come.
---
Most of us are ;)
---
Its not awful damage unless youre alliance. Its just not ideal damage. Arms is still out dpsing almost every other class/spec. Unless a guild is clearing MC under 1.5 hours and majority of DPS are pulling over 400 DPS they have no right to ask warriors to not be Arms. You can hit almost 600 DPS on single target at horde Arms.
---
I am absolutely loving phase 2.  It is some of the most fun I've ever had playing wow and I have played almost every expansion.  I have made Gladiator multiple times in arena, and for some bosses/xpacs I have top world kills.  Basically I have done it all in wow, and this is some of the most fun.  It is absolutely different than playing in Vanilla and I think that's what is making people upset.  This is Classic.  Not Vanilla.  Just because the game isn't what you envisioned it to be does not mean it is unplayable.  I play on a 70:30 Horde dominated pvp server.  It is a blast.  2 of my level 60s I regularly pvp on.  Both of which are bursty almost meme specs.  You have to be in this meta as it is all about getting quick solo kills and getting the hell out before 10 horde show up.  The majority of people complaining are the ones who cannot adapt and figure out this new game for themselves.
---
Greediest Need roll in history.
---
There are some tauren quests that deal with that. Don't think it was ever developed upon past vanilla.
---
I mean I'm not playing atm because farming means just doing jump runs or Strat. Otherwise I show up to OT raids.
---
The gold is worth something like 30 hours of hard solid grinding as a warrior, and I think Herod and grob will feel similar once bgs come out for the alliance
---
You will get more epics, edgemasters are insane. The lessened hit requirement will also be a huge boon for your gearing.
---
I rolled on an RP server at launch, im just here eating popcorn, enjoy your lack of ability to pvp on your server you fucked up.
---
It will never end
---
ah, there it is.
---
&gt; I'm not sure why you're completely unable to understand those two very simple sentences.
---
Because they make 0 sense. 
---
Yes they are. The size of any group of players doing any activity is based on the % of the population. To use your terrible example:
---
On any given raid day there are multiple groups running. The size of the raid, as you *so* astutely observed is always 40. Never 20, never 80. Its a fixed number. This is true. What changes depending on server size is the number of raid groups. 
---
Cities... are not raids. There is no fixed size. When one raid group fills up, another one forms. Anyone whose played wow for more than a month in any xpac knows this. Its not an instanced event. Like, are you even sure youre playing wow?! IDK you could get something so wrong.
---
Are server transfers going to be cross-realm type? I could just be remembering wrong but I thought PvP could only transfer to other PvP servers?
---
I just rerolled on a PvE server because I hit 51 in a PvP Server as soon as P2 came out on my Prot Warrior. Literally 0% chance of questing whenever I logged on. Would gladly pay to move my Warrior to a PvE
---
You can use warcraft logs to see raid progression/time for completed raids.  These are submitted by guilds though, so it won't have every guild.  Here is the link for your realm: [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/id/5036](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/id/5036)
---
The font it uses exists somewhere on your local machine, you could just replace that file
---
we must have no life at all
---
Where is this post? I have seen no such thing.
---
Does anyone know where I can get the furry text addon? Lmao
---
I wonder what happens to the bracket when theres no one left to farm. 
---
They need over 100 people to get 15 HKs to open up one spot in the top bracket from what I understand, I wonder if that is doable without some collusion.
---
There was an addon that allowed everyone to sync up to get a minimum of X people into the same AV, preform av enabler, which worked for quite a while.
---
I mean 1:30 clear is 32 guilds on my server. A pug did 1:17 last week. It’s not exactly asking a lot
---

---
Fucking books, I'm sick of missing story shit because they put it in books.
---
Ppl that wanna grind honor will do it in battlegrounds soon, and anyway honor points are a fotm thing. So this is not going to be such a big deal in the near future.
---
Before smugly shitting on the #NoChanges zealots, appreciate the fact that we wouldn't have Classic WoW without those people.
---
It isn't too bad if you and the healer have some MC gear. I can do it dual wielding 1h weaps with a pally, druid, or priest healer.
---
Great Idea!
---
I'd love to RP as General Angerforge, order around my minions and act important, but get killed OVER AND OVER AGAIN by teams of 5 horde or alliance.  And giggle as I never drop HOJ
---
mrglmrgl for the mrglmrgl god
---
We who played Vanilla were really thrown by this.  Even when honor was released back in '05, the world never felt like this.  I get that there's more people per server this time which makes the problem worse, but it doesn't feel anything like my Vanilla experience.  I think most people would've rolled PvE if they knew this was in store for them.
---
A very interesting concept, i'm amused. i'll definitely create something about it!
---
#nochanges would have included using vanilla size servers.
---
hahaha i love it! &lt;3
---
WA stands for? it looks great
---
If you want a good spot sneak into BRM and pick off horde stragglers that wander away from their camping groups outside of BRD
---
But let's think for a second. You could still have floating islands without flying. In WoW, the sky is the limit. There could be multiple ways to get to the islands dependent on the zone. Zangarmarsh could have bouncy mushrooms. Nagrand could have light bridges that extend when a switch is pulled. They could use these as an attunement type thing, to get the staff that creates walkways temporarily. The stormy nexus zone could have portals. The craggy war like zones could use catapults or cannons.  
---
Flying was unnecessary and the only real argument for it is convenience. And for me, that is a terrible argument considering everything else we lost in the process.
---
Holy shit, ease up on the Nazi shit. You are way off base here. He's explained the situation, get the fuck over it, and yourself.
---
ALL HAIL KUMAMON
---
Omg that is amazing. Its on the Twitch client?
---
Retard running away when he doesn't have that 10:1 outnumber ratio in pvp calling people pussies lmao
---
Oh same im on Mankrik not this hellhole
---
Those are great ideas. Would have loved some unlockable bouncy mushrooms, cannons, etc. Awesome.
---
No. That is definitely gay.

---
Open the config, ALT-left-click on a slot. This will add a floating button for that slot. Took my ages to figure out, although I should probably just have read the manual.
---
The first character had ~600 less honor but had 300 more standing. Why doesn't the character that earned more honor have a higher standing?
---
creepy at first but very fascinating! :O

Pretty sure lots of people left grob for deviate delight. Check the subreddit
---
why did you say "have a nice day"? thats such a weird and random thing to say in this situation
---
I'd like to do this with my mage friend - I'm curious how you kill the end boss.  We're both MC geared so I presume it's doable for us, just curious of the tactics!
---
I play horde on Skeram and I avoid joining the large roaming Horde gank squads. It's not even fun with how imbalanced it is. Most of the time I dont even attack anyone first.
---
Funny though that my suggestion to post on the official game forums got downvoted. It's like people think that complaining here on reddit and making the same post about how much they hate the game is going to fix it.
---
Hahahaha "ultra competitiveness"? No mate. This is what happens when the carrot on a stick, achievement obsessed, dopamine hit seeking gamer generation comes in. You all call it "ultra competitive" but it's always the same thing.. chasing titles and numbers fed to you by the game. People who want competition do not steamroll those who literally cannot fight back regardless of skill and call themselves good or beg off "because efficient".
---
I like competition. Actual competition, where my skill is challenged.. not my ability to find more people to group up with. World PvP was its own special kind of challenge that you aren't interested in.
---
&gt; It like the meme with the guy shoving a stick in his bike tire and then blaming everyone else when he falls.
---
This is so damn true it hurts, but not for the reason you think. The idiots pushing entire factions off of servers are literally ruining their own game and will have nobody else to blame but themselves. I mean they won't, they'll blame Blizzard.. but yeah.
---
World PvP in vanilla was far from perfect and far from free of greifing, but is *was* something special. Something that could have been brought back. Unfortunately that required the community to actually want it and you have all shown that you don't. 
---
Know what the worst thing is? What's happened in WoW has already guaranteed that world PvP as it was will never return in any game ever. It is well and truly dead, hope you're happy.
---
Yeah I saw the shield renew, and then shadowform later and thought, oh that Hunter = ded.
---
The other surprising thing was, 1v1? lol, I was waiting for 10 horde to crest the hill.
---
Yeah the only way to get HK is to camp players as long as possible /s.
---
How about just killing them in a group of 5 and then like leaving them to res and going after someone else. You sit there though practicing making peoples lives miserable for inefficient honor. It's pathetic.
---
Where can I read about this planned plague?
---
Why does this need a video?
---
You should have taken the free server xfer.  It really made a difference.  My new server is wonderful I’m finally able to play again.
---
I AM MORE THAN A FISH! I AM MORE THAN A MAN!
---
And i stand corrected. Stupid twitter
---
THANK YOU FUCK. I see so much negativity on phase 2, I was beginning to think I was weird or sadistic. But you have to adapt. Sometimes it’s better to smack and run, sometimes in more fun to wait for the team to show up. But you have to adapt. My favorite part is no day is the same. There is no one strategic way for me to farm honor, because one day it’s a rogue and me fighting over ore, the next it’s 2 mages just wrecking me. Every fight is different and you’ll lose some and win some.
---
Get edgemasters and bonescraper unless you can afford flurry axe.
---
Bonescraper will tide you over until something better since its the best easily obtainable offhand for fury.
---
This server is still going relatively strong, several people online at a minimum up to about 500 - 800 at peak.
---
well shit. Im almost 60 and I thought you had to time berserker rage before sap/fear for it to work.
---
Coordinated world pvp feels like a fair fight we both know what we are getting into.
---
Thank you. Exactly!
---
Leveling a war is not that bad. If you can afford it, get fiery on your first decent 2h youll keep for a few levels and do it for every weapon after. Fiery is broken on classic and helps so much. Use sunder armor a lot and youll be good. Cobalt crusher is good in your 20s for the proc as well. Id skip whirlwind if ally and go for bonebiter. Horde you have to get it.
---
thought id share my love idk man
---
Those are rats. Which are considered pests under azerothian law.
---
Would you want someone who would fall for it on your team?
---
Level and do the undead quests. Much of them revolve around creating a new plague.
---
“Haha what’s he gonna do, heal me to death?”
---
*activates shadowform*
---
“Guess I’ll die now”
---
But.. but... classic experience... 
---
The classic experience is this. What people played in vanilla was THEIR classic experience. And I know, that there was no way 100% of vanilla players played on a pvp server.
---
Would take the AP in that case, but its not a huge difference. Since you are a Horde player, you can skip Slam altogether and just spam Hamstring to dump rage with your OeB (thus getting a few windfury procs along the way), its pretty nice, and will only get better when / if you get the PvP gloves to reduce its Rage cost!
---
Fury is higher (single target) DPS than Arms, even with two-handed weapons, regardless, since you trade Sweeping Strikes, which is amazing in short, AoE content (PvP and Dungeons) for Death Wish which is always great, including on single target situations (Raids).
---
Wouldn't consider myself a celeb, but appreciate your thought :) hope this helps you out!
---
they've already said BWL will be early 2020. I take that as January sometime. I'm ok with that timeline. and hope that ZG would be easter, and AQ40 next Oct/Nov, and lastly Naxx in 2021 sometime.   I hope this game lasts longer than 1 yr.
---
I used to tell those people to go back to Star Wars Galaxies. In that game it may have been a requirement to be a dancer or musician on the path to being a jedi
---
Frozen 2 is legit man, Elsa and that water elemental horse are fkn boss.
---
Having a numbers advantage makes you good now?
---
Tbf they massacred the local night elf populaces and cut down hundreds of trees. They kinda deserved it.
---
God how dare you give some guy a useful ability, you should be ashamed
---
Oh man i might gonna buy that cape but if only i would know its lenght or color...
---
Yeah, it shows the real cowards. My alts are 24 and 16 and I get ganked non stop. And what for? You think I’m being my main across the world to fight you? Well maybe, but not always!
---
I recommend sticking it out as bit and seeing how bgs affect the server. World ganking crap slows a lot with bg release
---
Most people I would say as Undead is by far the most popular Horde race
---
And on top of all that, any other odds and ends could just use flight masters and flightpaths, like the rest of the game.  
---
The worst part is that 95% of the content was in outlands. There was no reason to spend time in a world without flying. There's so much blank space in Azeroth, they could have added tons of content to that world and split people's time between flying world and non flight. I feel like flying was forced upon us in a way that we can't go back.  
---
That's why I hope classic doesn't get to that point again. It's a bottle that you just can't put a cork on, and it drastically changes what the game is.
---
I deleted horde Herod and rerolled Alliance for this very reason. I might be the only one...
---
I was geared with an epic mount too!
---
Once they've been targeted once it holds that macro for a minute so as long as you enter targetable range you can re-target again by clicking.  I had this happen to me all the time when I was trying to quest in Un'Goro at 50. Same warrior would chase me town and be able to charge me as long as he was in range even if I was out of LOS.
---
It's weak auras, an addon for wow that allows you to use custom lua scripts. Here's a link for the one I use. https://wago.io/CjL90mVtb
---
Oomkins can still just travel form and run.  The basic point is it's a very safe "non kill" for the lock if the druid plays very safe and stays out of range of fear.  Bear in mind Oomkin have +10% range so they have like 36 yard range compared to what, 15 or 20 for fear?
---
Read them then
---
Other hunters that havent played since 2005 when they were 13 years old.
---
From my point of view ~~the jedi~~ everyone else is evil!
---
Im on Earthshaker tho.
---
You should be able to premade every BG in classic. On private servers they limited the ability to q in large groups. Don't think that was Blizzlike.
---
I wonder if there's some crazy marketing or something going on. Qi and WILTY showed up in my YouTube feed last month and I have developed a need for British Panel Shows. Now I'm seeing David Mitchell and Lee Mack like everywhere.

Nope, just a regular raider :)
---
I get that man but it's not like the alliance wouldn't be griefing us if the roles were reversed you know what I'm saying. even then man I can't quest on my alts right now at all, tho I'll say on herod in terms of PvP population  I think it's pretty even. the alliance on our server are rowdy as hell and easily own places every night. some servers I see I absolutely believe something should be done tho because it is a problem. just saying it's not just horde players causing these issues, it's horde players just being lucky in a way. 
---
tho I'll say personally I stopped killing low lvl people because I just feel awful. especially tho lil dwarfs waving at me, just makes my heart warm to see them happy
---
You get a token.
---
True. I said that in my post. Holy Paladin is way more effective than a Ret Paladin, but you can’t do anything without a group. A lot of people get burn out from that level of dependence.
---
&gt; semantic difference, there are significant differences
---
I suppose I worded it wrong.  They would band 2-3 small servers together in MoP and play on the same realm and be able to join the same guilds.  I didn't mean like what you would see sitting in Boralus currently.
---
In their defense, have you seen the female dwarf model? Burn it.
---
Yeah it will be a render with touch ups.
---
[Yes, right here](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help/index.shtml)
---
So cheap shot and get in front while auto attacking, gouge. Then break gouge with a ss, ks?  Or walk away and re-stealth?
---
They will usually blink away after the gouge is broken so I usually get poly locked and chain slowed to death if I can’t burst them down right away. Just looking for tips
---
yes, i wish we can see ingame the world changed as we progress!
---
Trying to figure each classes best role in WSG. Let me know what you think. D = Defense, O = Offense, M = Midfielder
---
**Druid**: Obviously flag carrier, slippery bitches. Stealth in, grab flag, travel form and fuck off. If you get in trouble go bear and lean on your team. O.
---
**Shaman**: Best defensive class, can use sentry totems to scout areas like the tunnel and use far sight to have the entire area under guard. Can sit in ghost wolf to prevent from getting sapped on the flag. D, but also good as M.
---
**Rogue**: I like them defensively or offensively but not as a fc because they're a bit squishy. Not great for brawling in the middle of the map, they should be used for tactical 'missions' where their utility can be played to. I like them best on D because they can operate in short bursts of action as they were intended, and Rogues biggest problem in BGs is getting caught out of stealth with no CDs, which can happen in enemy territory or in a teamfight.
---
**Warrior**: Get stuck in the middle with a pocket healer and swing your dick around. Form an iron wall in front of your base and challenge anyone that if they want your flag they'll have to get through you. M
---
**Priest**   If shadow, melt some brains. M. If not stay on your warrior's ass and keep him healthy and strong, camp your flag and help your defenders, or heal the flag carrier. Useful everywhere, on O, M, and D.
---
**Warlock:** Might be a hot take but I think Warlock is overall the best pvp class in the entire game. What can't they do? They can fight in the middle, they can fuck over a fc, and soulstone/defend their own fc.
---
**Paladin:** I play Horde, idk. O I guess? The Pally's claim to fame is what a nuisance they are to kill. Push into the base and be a big fat sponge.
---
**Hunter:** Scout with eyes of the beast defensively or offensively, flares to catch stealthies in your base out out front, and very good fighters in general. D or M about equally.
---
**Mage:** Best teamfighters in the game. M, easy.
---
The OH looks super good at first glance, but I'm not seeing a one-handed weapon that would make the combo better than Benediction until BWL. I guess LoL plus Hammer of Grace may be better for players that haven't gotten an eye yet.
---
why does it upset you so much lol
---
Heartseeker might end up with the same fate...
---
CAN I INTEREST YEH IN A PINT?!?!
---
I’m convinced most of the issues on the imbalanced servers are people that enjoy the griefing less than for the honor farm. 
---
Or else you wouldn’t be having a bunch of horde corpse spawning on auction houses for literally hours so that alliance can’t use the ah and other merchants. 
---
It’s just lame.
---
Spam moonfire in between auto attacks with that long ass timer. Lowkey strong af
---
That is some hardcore grasping at straws.  Seeking immortality isn't really evil at all, I feel like most people would want to stay young and live forever if they could.  Invading an innocent farming village and harvesting human skulls on the other hand.
---
This should be studied like the blood plague incident in vanilla.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Battle chasers are good too
---
It seems that the channel 4 YouTube channel has been dumping several of the panel shows onto YouTube lately.
---
No jumping in
---
&gt; All they did was chop wood before the elves just started shooting. What the fuck kinda logic is that? Just cause hippy elves consider trees sacred doesnt mean other races do lmao
---
So you're admitting you don't know a single thing about what happened, or what Treants are, or what Ashenvale really is. Cool. Whatever you say.
---
You are misunderstanding, then.
---
Adding players at the same rate to both factions will make wins by the outnumbered side increasingly less probable. This is not a small effect.
---
It's not much better for lower lvl horde on Stalagg. I hit 48 on my shaman alt shortly after the pvp system released and was able to do nothing besides run dungeons and grind mobs in obscure places all the way to 60. I managed to do about half the un'goro quests on a day where I was able to play during offpeak hours but I still spent as much time corpse running as I did anything else.
---
"Is there no one else!?"
---
An hour a day use to be possible, that's eventually all double xp leveling, back when you could quest and mob grind but yah, after SM you essentially are forced to dungeon run as alliance on a pvp server.
---
Coming off so high and mighty and still so wrong... lmao. Stop acting like WPvP is a spreadsheet you can just break down into percentages. 4000 could easily take down 6000. How? Everyone uses a sapper charge. Seriously that fucking simple.   
---
The thing everyone keeps ignoring is that when you increase our player numbers, even to ridiculously absurd amounts like 6000, we still have between 2000-4000 HP. If even 10mages use blizzard on a group of 6000people all stacked up, they're going to get shredded. Large scale WPvP is about who can attack first with a coordinated AOE attack.
---
Say no more!
---
why is it never humans lol
---
Mak'gora me coward
---
I think they wipe out the stonespire tribe in vanilla, that big excavation/ dwarf hold in the southern barrens used to be where a taruen tribe's lands were
---
Never played a hunter but maybe
---
/cast counter attack
---
/cast wing clip
---
?
---
Too lazy to look up the spells but for rogues riposte is a spell activated only by parries so you put it in a macro like
---
/cast riposte
---
/cast sinister strike
---
Probably because you're not getting hit?
---
Because this subreddit is treating it like Hong Kong where we need breaking news updates everytime another alliance player logs into an empty capital city

---
No its classic cast bars
---
From a customer service point of view, for the individual player, it's a good solution. For the overall health of the server it was bad. 
---
I think it was Blizzard acknowledging that the situation was fucked and there wasn't much that was going to fix it. 
---
Not introducing BG's with the honor system ended up being the wrong move, but I get the they didn't. They were hoping for some of the open world skirmish stuff that used to happen.

They just didn't expect how the massive increase in server populations would affect gameplay in the open world once people started getting bored from lack of PvE content, and those trying to get the jump on the Rank system.
---
Battle chaser if you don’t need hit, otherwise bloodmail.   The pvp boots are very solid if you use them for the 2 piece set bonus as well
---
Exactly, it would be better than other tier in order to make the spec on par instead.
---
I hope for small battle groups "max 6 realms", only people form same realm are put on teams together, and only same type realms get grouped
---
LOL
---
And Horde get a better Paladin
---
Just tell the raid you had important frost mage research and ask them to let it go this time. I am sure they will understand.
---
They should just add wait queues for specific factions if the server is too imbalanced at any time.
---
65% horde on for 35% Alliance? Horde have to wait until it's 60%/40%
---
They dont even let you comment on why your unsubbing anymore. Blizzard doesnt care anymore why your leaving
---
Even older women
---
You'd think at some point, people would start to feel bad about raiding a city whose population is smaller than your raid group.
---
Cloudkeeper legs are the replacement if you are using edgies, which you need to be using since you aren’t human or dwarf
---
I disagree with their tank/dps hybrid comment, as far as tanking goes in the current phase of the game, you only need full bear talents if you are tanking skull.  If not you generally don't need the mitigation that thick hide gives you and you can chuck spare points into cat talents.

---
This build is great for being the 2nd or 3rd tank, has almost the same threat generation as full bear talents, and has almost as much dps as full cat talents. Improved enrage isn't worth 2 talent points for 10 rage per minute unless you are full bear.
---
The talents Blood frenzy and Primal fury are entirely up to you based on what you prefer, I prefer having the wiggle room of free combo points in cat, Primal fury is better if you dungeon tank more often.

Go install elvui for classic from their website. Website might be tukui or something like that. Enjoy a new ui interface that allows you to customize every little facet you could ever want to.

Chromaggus and Maexxna all but require a warrior tank.

On Onyxia and Nefarian you might also be better off with a warrior. Apart from those few, druids are amazing.

At the beginning of the lumber harvesting, sure. The orcs set up camp in their land and started harming nature though-- along with bringing combat ready troops to defend their operations.
---
I'd hardly consider that a lack of provocation, especially considering their wisps were extracting wood from the trees nearby already and would've had to be cut down unless specifically avoided by a group of armed savages.

Kind of insane that entire servers are dying and they're remaining silent about it while making terrible decisions to mitigate the issue.

In BC they do. Unless you're implying shaman are better than paladin in group pvp, in which case you're insane.

That was what I used on private servers but it doesn't work on here sadly, thanks though :/
---
Deviant delight is a fuckin mess but I’m having fun. Never played wow seriously and vanilla to wotlk was my fuckin jam.
---
If you don't need hit % I guess, it's a solid place to get some hit. I prefer hit there and valour for aesthetic in shoulders instead of true strike (sitting at 9% hit with some raid gear)
---
Sounds like you actually prefer PvE server with the ability to flag for PvP

Sick af. What is that shield addon/aura??
---
Hardest part of the quest was wandering around for hours trying to find Simone.
---
Those fingers are wrapping way too far around that torch.
---
Roaming around and searching for new players to kill is way less efficient than corpse camping. Think about it logically, some horde come upon an alliance, kill them. if they leave they may not find another alliance, if they stay they know they will get another kill. Once you hit 5 kills on the guy then you take off.
---
Hunter is number one. Warlock is arguably the second, but I would put Druid before lock due to mobility.

With zero downtime. Having leveled a druid to 60 on classic, and a rogue on Nost, the druid was the strongest leveler by far.
---
No thanks, in higher dungeons I will simply find a different dps and be on the safe side, I don't like mobs running around, messing my threat and stressing the healer cause the shaman wants to "off tank", I ask for DPS, not for an offtank.

Oh good it's been almost 20 mins since someone posted about Flamelash.  Don't you have a realm forum or something?

Nope, meant in BC. Seal of Blood shit on the alliance Paladins for daring to not be waifu material

IIRC scholo was originally supposed to be a ten man raid, so it makes sense it is the hardest 5 man dungeon haha. As others have said LOS and proper CC makes it bearable
---
Also probably didn't say 2%
---
Oh shut up, you're so blind and biased it's unbelievable, Horde occupy EVERY single area at ALL times, there's not a single safe spot in the entire map, Alliance gank squad occupy SOME areas at CERTAIN hours, it's not close to balanced, if you're playing on the Horde, you're currently playing easy mode.
---
Because 60/40 isn’t that bad at all

To be fair, its kind of a good that it get this much attention tho. This can happen to any server if Blizzard wont sort things out. The salt dude

You can't profit off the Undercity's lands while pledging loyalty to Stormwind and the Alliance. If they're unhappy about it, they can blame the Wrynn regime for ousting the people of Lordaeron from the Alliance.

Only important on lvl 63 mobs. This is not necessary for dungeons

Do tanks currently have the gear to survive that?

Hey i know you lol

Dude find a pve server. Doesn't matter which one. If you flag for pvp, it went be a fair fight 95% of the time

Have you been on vacation for a month?

Pop on to, say, Wolframalpha.com and have it show you the distribution of coin flips. Entering "# coin flips" will do it.
---
so just fuck pvp and the rest of the game?
---
You missed the point, and judging by your fixation with "spoiled child" insult, you're probly projecting that as well. 
---
Let me summarize my point to see if we can reach an understanding. I dislike the group of hyper competitive players that so over did it with this game (hundreds upon hundreds of hours played at this stage) that they have nothing else left to do in game but camp lowbies all day everyday.
---
Oh right, forgot about that. No point in trying to get hit past that though, returns are so diminishing especially when it comes to balancing gear. Your crit and AP would be so low if all you did was stack hit.
---
Over/under on this being a horde player?
---
Probably not, prob real stupid
---
Fair enough, my bad
---
Well, how many have positive interactions with horde, how many have negative? How many PvP servers are horde dominated versus alliance? How does said domination increase or decrease the likelihood that any given faction will have significant negative experiences? 
---
Let’s put your proportions skills to the test!
---
I suppose this discussion isn't really being seen anymore but I'm inclined to reply again as it's quite interesting. 
---
I would say nochanges was all in all the best play to make just because... (not to bash Blizzard too hard... ) but I think allowing changes would generally do more harm than good - They can't really be trusted to do more good than harm, so getting it exactly how it was is all in all the best achievable situation, and I would say we didn't even get that. However I agree that some changes could conceivably be improvements. Let me add that I think the original team worked some magic and that it would be quite difficult for anyone now to make changes that would be improvements. It was the sort of yelling tactic that could be heard over all the noise and it was close or common enough to what people wanted for many people to get behind it, loudly.
---
I don't like blaming players for problems in a game. It's what you're supposed to do in any game, to try your best to obtain an advantage. I don't think it makes sense to ask people to just honestly and willfully stop ganking out of the goodness of their hearts. Steps should be taken to make it fair (even population,) and maybe add guards. But so long as people aren't cheating, in my view they're doing nothing wrong. Any such issue in any game is by definition an issue with the game and not its players. You can't expect to control these people in any way, and it might make sense to say that you can't blame them.
---
About games being solved, I'm not so sure. Games like starcraft and Smash bros Melee are played for a long time and remain interesting at the top level. Also, even if it is solved, I haven't solved it, so it's still interesting for me, and I would want the game to continue to exist even if many have "solved." There is also replay-ability to solved games. I wouldn't call it solved though. Camping flightpoints has its drawbacks, one being that it's bad honour. 
---
Anyway, most of our conversation I think has been tangential to the OP's point, which is that, even if a ton of people know exactly what to expect and what the best "solutions" are in the game, it doesn't mean everybody does, and it doesn't mean that every noob should be shamed for not knowing something in a 5-man or even raid, partly because some people like to beat games without guides, and maybe some people are just bad at games in general and still want to play.
---
As you say, the honor system is the issue. Releasing it before battlegrounds was a very interesting move, to say the least, relegating the whole world to brutal combat and death. They probably had an idea what it would do, and it was probably justified by saying that it would be temporary.  They probably didn't expect it to be this bad, as we agree they should have, but anyway, maybe BGs will help.
---
I think people realize that the game would be played largely differently, and that would change the experience.  This is what makes an idea like Wow2 exciting, but that would be a whole other thing, or getting into a different MMO. So I think people behind nochanges realize some of this - I wouldn't call it horribly misguided. 
---
I would say that I generally do disagree with the way the people approach the game. The idea of "content" doesn't ring with me. I have fun in the game my own way. Maybe its at the auction house, or by 2-manning dungeons. These things are not efficient and are not part of the way people have solved the game. But I have nothing against those people. Well, I do think that it's inordinately scummy to gank someone at the auction house, but it's part of the game. I've played bad MMOs with zillions of quests, so I don't like to say a game needs more content. 
---
To blame the honour system though - it's too huge of a thing to point the finger at, and have it be productive. It's part of the game to kill the other faction. (I didn't like the posts in phase 1 of orcs and humans standing together in questing harmony.) It's almost the whole point of the game to kill the other faction - it is for me anyway. I like to get gear to be better in PvP - many are like that. This is why I spoke first about the release timing, which is more changeable. But saying there's an issue with rewarding killing the other faction... it's just such a deep part of the game that it's hard to address something so general. Sure, killing lowbies or honourless targets is a little unnecessary... so I don't think people need to be doing that, except for the tactical reason for having those honourless targets dead. It's possible that the honour system actually needs to be more elaborate. 
---
Basically, I think we agree on details, but on not on the general tone of the whole thing. As an example, to your final point, I think people generally do admit that we/they were bad at the game in comparison to now. My hunter did not have grenades, and I don't recall anyone ever stunning me in vanilla, but I see how they would have been able to catch me with them.
---
I suppose you're saying that player behaviour is ruining the game thanks to the honour system.  Basically I have said that the game should be set up such that player behaviour cannot ruin it. You might think that this would require "changes," as you've implied, and I might agree with some hypothetical changes, but that said I still generally don't think that "nochanges" was misguided, and in fact if we had achieved something closer to the "nochanges" ideal, the issues wouldn't be so huge, even within the context of changed player behaviour.
---
People did not mean they wanted the same experience, they only wanted the same game, and new experiences, largely realizing that it would be different in today's meta.
---
How about this question. Would having balanced factions even be better??? Isn't it kind of cool, that the minority faction is faced with a serious problem in game? Back in the day, I don't believe they balanced the factions, and the team today decided to leave it as a wild west style environment. Balancing factions comes with queues, or disallowed character creation for the dominant faction, or server mergers. I'm implying that, maybe nochanges even prevails on this problematic point.

Serennia/avatar id rather do a bigger post that won’t get closed dunno where to do it
---
awful how?
---
I tanked MC with a mace as an orc because it was "BIS" in vanilla.  My computer didn't explode, my threat generating capability was never threatened.  
---
And I \*gasp\*  Did it in deep prot, with shield slam.  \*shock, horror\*...  Know how much bullshit I had to peel off from someone after I pulled it?
---
None.  Pretty sure the phrase I heard was something along the lines of "I'm pretty sure that if &lt;xxx&gt; dies during Gehennas, they're just going to stay right where they are kicking his corpse."
---
I watched another Orc tank tank Ragnaros with an Arclight Spanner.  Server didn't crash, and after two wipes getting used to the progression of the fight...  I spent DKP on a Spinal Reaper.
---
I think a lot of people are going after edge cases where guild have been on the bleeding edge of something; which more often than not...  isn't the case.
---
Chances are you'll be sitting in BWL and pulling gear from there before any of this shit is actually going to start to matter.  And by then, we'll be beyond "pre-raid BIS".
---
My advice to anyone is that they need to relax about all this shit, unless getting shitty with people and running spreadsheets to squeeze that tiiiiiiny percentage is something they genuinely enjoy.  
---
And if that's the case; fine.  But just declare it.  "Disclaimer:  I'm a spreadsheet and be an asshole type of person."
---
The folks on the boundary you're talking about aren't on reddit asking questions about weapons.
---
Blizzard has never really showed us they are smart, so...
---
&gt;Horde hang out in org almost exclusively.
---
This is false and you know it. There are plenty of horde in Undercity at all times of the day on Skeram. I don't know why you'd bother misleading people about this.
---
Yeah I'm well aware of how insanely broken the balance is in TBC. The good thing is that in TBC faction balance ceases to matter because world pvp is dead and arenas can be horde v horde.
---
What's gph for this with skinning? Was questing there and saw a 38 warrior there.. was wondering if that was what he was up to...
---
That was great
---
Because they aren’t well informed or don’t tank in raids. Humans should use swords. Orcs should use axes. Every other race should use edgeguards or daggers w/ muggers/ACLGs. 305 weapon skill is worth 3% hit, and increases your auto attack damage by about 6% on raid bosses
---
Someone else said that that's because they actually put effort into alliance city design, but rushed horde design so they were basically like "idk just plop a bunch of guards everywhere"
---
Still, the Tauren didn’t make the final decision on a faction joining the horde. That’s what the Warchief does.
---
Benediction is pretty good
---
Yea how dare you create more threads about an important issue that will most likely kill classic pvp servers instead of putting a picure of a shitty cake your boyfriend made you for your birthday.
---
Dont let the common folk disturb your beliefs brother, stay strong for the Stonemason Guild !
---
Yes they will. There are more PVP servers than PVE, with higher average populations, and all but one of them lean Horde.
---
The only way Horde players get shorter queues than Alliance is if Blizzard keeps PVP and PVE servers separated and the Horde players in question are playing on the PVE servers.
---
Tauren could have just as easily been an alliance race, but then no one would want to play a happy go lucky, peaceful cow race.
---
If they are breaking TOS, no. Otherwise make your game work for you however you can.
---
Why are warriors all entitled cunts?
---
Yeah its a blast on my relm. I think its technically 60:40 horde dominated. However the alliance seem to be very active and good with pvp. Mostly I just 1v1 other 60s I find while minning nodes. I prefer getting really close to lowbies and waving to them. Hoping they are shitting their pants as I try to be funny but ultimately let them live.
---
I mean, it's really hard to stress how often you are NOT repenting your attack target lmao, especially in bgs which is where this weapon will get the most use.
---
BRE is good too but every warrior will get that before a ret will, and hand of rag is still better anyway. A ret is not in that WSG/AB for their masterful cc.
---
You seem triggered. You should take a break from the game.

I'm sure it'll help :)

Nope, it’s a very large part of why Warriors are great against Walocks and Rogues. Also overpower if you spec into will destroy rogues.
---
Orc warrior
---
The horde were just doing what the game encouraged them to do, it alliance and horde were 50:50 it wouldn’t be so bad
---
So in pvp you need 5% hit which is a little easier to hit. I would still recommend the devilsaur. Devilsaur is basically a purely Pve item to help with hit early before you can really itemize it better
---
They should get together and all agree to not log on to the server for a week. I abandoned my orc warrior on skeram, to go play horde on an alliance dominated pve realm. Be the solution not the problem.
---
Is there anyway to drop out of combat with being a hunter using feign death or a rogue using vanish? Is there a potion or engineering item or some rare consumable?
---
Yo can I get a port to Stonard?!?
---
Orc surprisingly, the big shoulderpads can sway anyone
---
A lot being 2 of 9 classes btw (priest and prot warrior). On the other hand there is a base stun resistance of 5% and the resist chance from fire resistance.

What is it like on Krom? I play horde Herod and honestly it doesn’t feel as bad as some make it seem. I love to PVP although it’s not what I’m spending 100% of my time doing. I get fucked several times a day by a small number of rogues grouping or a massive raid. Winter spring, searing gorge and ever kargath are heavily contested most of the time. 
---
And getting into to BRM is just a flat out dice roll most of the time
---
I like this circle jerk of hate, it's good there's passion the the game!
---
We're on Pagel. The only problem I've had so far is some jerk horde players keep killing an escort for a quest in Westfall. Usually someone has an lvl 60 friend they can get to come help complete it though.
---
Get ACLGs
---
I get that you want every server to turn into Flamelash because you prefer the PvE experience, but like I said above alliance side Skeram is still alive and kicking unfortunately for you.

What are you even talking about?

No premades, get your CAPS key inspected before queueing up.

They also said classic would never happen so who knows.

Funny story. I have the gadgetzan teleporter so I'm there every day for pvp and I'd say it's one of the few cities where alliance consistently outnumber horde. Obviously things are always changing back and forth, but gad seems to usually avoid the zergs and I get honorable 1v1s there all the time. 
---
More alliance come over to kirtonos! We have an awesome pvp scene, were in the sweet spot of not overcrowded but also never slow, and the allis here put up a good fight. It sucks that we lost many alliance to blizzards ignorant transfers, but theres now more leveling alli then horde on census. After bgs wpvp will be mellow enough to cap np.

This is also false. Absurdly false. The only time it is true is maybe 8pm on a Tuesday. Do you even play on this server?

Seeking immortality when 4/5 dragon aspects *tell you not to do it* and ***refuse to have any part in it***, though? Elves were given a gift ten thousand years before, and as soon as it went away they immediately tried to get it back in a rash decision. These are the druids who are *always* going on at length about how nature and the balance is of the utmost, but totally ignore it when they want something for themselves.
---
The Forsaken on the other hand? Imagine you die to a horribly painful plague. Then you rise from your grave, your mind is shackled, and you're forced to fight for the very thing that killed you. Eventually, you're freed from its control and have your sanity and sense of self back. You look around and see death and decay and try to build something back up, only to have the living do everything they can do kill you. They're the ones that *lived.* The ones that have *no idea* what you went through. Your former family and friends in many cases. And yet.. they seek to kill you even after you've been liberated, and to destroy all that you've tried to build and create, purely because *you're* the one who built and created it, and ***only*** because they refuse to recognize your sanity and recovered sovereignty.
---
When you fight back against the zealots, the rest of the humans and elves *also* brand you as evil, because now you're an undead who's killing the living even if it's only in self defense. You try to take back your homelands, but find the living there as well, who object violently to your retaking of *your* lands, going so far as to ambush caravans bringing you supplies. All the while you're dealing with ogres and yeti swarming in from above, and *more* living threats in the Syndicate. So you end up in a situation where you have to just.. y'know. Kill them all. With that kind of existence, taking and preserving the skulls of the departed seems like a relatively minor quirk for a soldier to pick up; you specifically get the quest *because* you're going to be out killing humans, not *just* to go kill humans.
---
I got a hell of a lot more respect and empathy for the Forsaken than I do the Night Elves. Just how *many* calamities over the world's history have elves caused anyway? The Sundering is *their* fault, for instance.
---
Not as bad as I expected, but it probably would've been a lot better if it weren't for the first round of transfers. Blizzard really screwed up on that one.
---
I sure do.  I'm in one of the top 3 Alliance guilds and would be willing to wager my play time is among the highest on the server.  This video is some propaganda shenanigans.
---
While the PvE-servers tend to be Alliance-dominated, they have a much lower total player count. So the end result will very likely still be longer queues for Horde.
---
This. I expect we will be grouped with people in our data center. Either way as you say everything is speculation because blizzard hasn’t said anything.
---
Goddamnit, now they know.
---
I’m realizing I’m not making myself clear. The law of large numbers and the coin flip example doesn’t apply to what I’m saying. It has nothing to do with the number of times the coin is flipped, more to do with the number of coins being flipped. The likely outcome remains the same.
---
I thought Ibce Block/Bubble just saved the person that has the bomb. The explosion still hits surrounding people no?
---
He forgot the start it with "Unpopular Opinion".
---
I am as concerned as you are. I started a warlock alt whilst leaving my warrior main to accrue double exp. Sunken Temple can be amazing exp at your level and it is not hard to enter at all. There are ways to maximize exp there too.   
---
BRD is next decent exp at your level, if you get a group of similar level players you can run first half of BRD and reset without leaving and then repeat. This repeated a few times will get you a few levels. I did live strat last night for first time at 57, getting into that instance was less painful.

 Being short does not look "cool".

In fact its exactly the opposite.

The portal tip is the kind of dirty fighting I wanted to hear about. Thanks mate.
---
If you do want to stay pvp but don't mind re-rolling, there are a small amount of pvp servers that actually have decent balance. Still all horde-heavy, but not even remotely as bad as the ones you regularly read about on here.

Just in case anyone was foolish enough to think that horde might have to put up with the DM gauntlet too

I think this is more of a super server mentality. I'm guessing you're part of the larger realms? I'm on a high pop that's probably half the size of some of the others and this idea of being honorable is more prevalent here. Wpvp will always be war, but if you can never find honorable people, that just means you have bad server culture.

Same here. I logged in the day PvP dropped did one run to BRM and told my guild I'd see them next week for raid night.  
---
I've logged on once per week since then for raid night and haven't been on outside that. If this keeps up after bgs drop I'll quit for real.
---
I was there it was lit.  Got like 6k honor in an hour.  New weekly record for me
---
That I actually Didn't know - I'll edit, thanks.
---
This is Heartstriker GER? Its not 95%. Its highly Alliance dominated but not 95/5.
---
In classic the main quest is to get to level 60. Where as the final goal is to get pretty purples and fat lewts so you can dump on people in PvP. Classic is primarily a PvP iteration of wow as the pve content is pretty bland and simple. Everything else basically comes naturally. Join us.
---
I'm not too sure, I might try it out later and let you know.
---
The thing I love about healbot is threat notification. I know when someone has aggri right away. It’s worth having just for that alone.
---
If you don't mind grinding go to Hillsbrad, into the mines in the bottom left of the map and kill the miners in there to your hearts content, it's a little traveled area you can avoid most of the world pvp in. If that area is being farmed or if there's an allie presence (there shouldn't be but maybe) in the bottom right of hillsbrad are a large group of naga right on the coast that are pretty easy to kill.   
---
You say you finished ashenville but I don't 100% believe you, did you do the quests on the far left coast? there's a flight point there and a pretty large group of quests.
---
What changes could they have made? Specifically to make things “unknown”
---
You enter with the Sceptre. Sneak around to the right, avoiding the Hydra. Pull 1-3 of the Lasher packs at a time (there are a total of 7 packs I believe, I started with 1 at a time, then 2, then 3, etc as I felt more comfortable). After Lashers are all dead, there are a bunch of turtles further down the path that are easy to AOE farm. I would get 2-3 Bars every run, takes 10-12 minutes to clear, another couple minutes to reset. EZ :) Dying is frustrating though so go slow lol. Check out videos on YouTube of Mage Mara Solo Exp Farm
---
The real life experience.
---
Plz tell me the item itself is a stack of something.
---
I think there is an engineering helmet that will allow you to drop combat similar to rogues vanish
---
Wait for someone out of the loop what happened on the 5th of December there
---
The only people regretting their decisions are the ones who listened to Blizzard and transferred to Heartseeker. Now they're getting corpse camped in their own capital cities.
---
Well, Balnazzar is the one who has brain washed everyone in the scarlet crusade.
---
This is further proven by the fact that Brother Anthon, a member of the scarlet crusade, is friendly in Nijels pointe, Desolace, he was stationed there before Balnazzar stole the Grand Crusaders identity.
---
I run a green pair of +13 str, +13 agi shoulders for PvE since i 2H and have my hit elsewhere.
---
I enjoy it
---
on my server horde owns brm and alliance owns dire maul, i can't even go fishing in feralas, glad i did my nat pagle quest before p2
---
I believe this was a thing in classic wow originally, but they nerfed it by adding some ranged mobs into these packs and the ooze's cast something. Now the Mage Mara exp farm is in the Sceptre entrance.
---
yeah I played til WotLK and have no idea who that is, maybe I'm the 10%
---
If you roll alliance on benediction I’ll hook you up with free bags and a couple gold.
---
Good point, thank you!
---
Yeah! It seems like you can get pretty into it but I just use the most basics lol and it works amazing.
---
Phase 6 no? Thats what i saw on atlas
---
Weird itemization is the main reason I quickly dismissed my fleeting notions of playing a holy paladin. There's just not enough plate with proper healing stats, most of the paladin sets are some inefficient mix of low spell power and strength that isn't ideal for any spec. The PvE BiS gear consists almost exclusively of cloth and leather which isn't usable in PvP. T1 is okay for the earlier phases, but then it isn't until Naxx that there's a real holy paladin set.
---
Very nice.
---
One minor nitpick: just know that wasn't a POM Pyro, POM makes it instant cast. That was a fully casted Pyroblast.
---
Only julio band is worth it
---
13,000 CP for the top 0.2%. Just enough to make progress on the 11–12,000 decay at r13.
---
Not sure why you and the hordie think this guy is dumb or something it’s pretty clear he doesn’t think it literally lasts forever, he’s saying you could let a pack of adds continue to attack you and with the stacked bonus you wouldn’t die.
---
You notice it in the language the alliance uses towards the horde, they constantly refer to them as monsters and sub-human. The Horde wants to kill the alliance, but at least they dont consider them as literal evil sub-sentient monsters...
---
Even on our Horde populated server, Alliance tend to still dominate Dire Maul entrance + bridges on the way there.
---
Yea i know, in a way classic is too right now.
---
no
---
I don't play mage or paladin, but I am pretty sure I have seen a mage get the bomb, basically immediately iceblock, then go back to dpsing. They didn't blow up the raid either.
---
No way losing 2 globals is worth it. Forget the weapon switch. All you need is 2 gems, mage armor and full mana before the pull.
---
Have you tried playing a game where you roll on a pve server and stop whining about pvp being on a pvp server? I hear those are fun PLUS you don't have to post on reddit about how bad your life is when no one cares.
---
Human behavior is to blame and I shouldn't need some hand of god waiting above to put a stop to pieces of shit like yourself. What I said was that it isn't efficient and it's not.
---
Yeah just dont rezz then?
---
quick question is this a ingame Addon or a Local Webpage for ones browser?
---
Oh, so it was the characters by themselves colluding. I guess the guy shouldnt get a ban because it wasn't him doing it, it was his wow characters.... moron
---
Lol imagine being this obsessed with meters
---
What game did your son get interested in?
---
yes but if everyone is grinding bgs its significantly easier to judge honor/day honor/week say "i can probably rank up this week with X hours of AV/WSG", or "X hours a week at Y honor per hour should get me roughly to bracket Z for standings"
---
Barbaric is a term used by those who don’t want to see their power diminished.
---
I sure hope that when duel ended, someone /taunt at ally so you can go and duel.
---
Back in TBC days i was i  Dentarg horde EU.. alliance members were so rare, that they were usually walking in Orgrimar, and noone would even touch them. Was nice than, no PVP wannabees and everyting was simpler back than.
---
New wow classic release is for mostly newer wow players that were always pissed when older members talked about the vanila and classic. They missed most of it, and today they are trying so much that the game is ruined..
---
Just my 2 cents, from a vanila player and casual player trough all expansions...
---
Mage is #1 hunter is #2 in terms of pure speed solo. Parties then mage warrior priest.
---
That's 99 percentile for one fight haha.
---
&gt;I don't see how Swtor had cartoony graphics either.
---
was responding to this...
---
Yeah, he's a POM Pyro mage, he just hard casted that one cause he thought I was afk lol. I use it on the POM Pyros as well by life tapping myself down to half hp and waiting to see the rez.
---
Wow a warrior too? I love it when priests buff my warrior.
---
can you link me your build good sir? I'm actually in search for a good build like that.
---
lol he actually said that? What a total loser.
---
Check out Skarm on youtube, he is really good.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ
---
He talks a lot about druid and warrior tanking, differences etc.
---
Weapon DPS does nothing for feral druids.
---
Just give the game a shot and see how you like it.
---
how do you live without tactical mastery? do you stay everytime in def stance? how do you AOE?
---
Just overlooked. I know in vanilla mass of McGown was sought after on my server.
---
Nah cause Caine teamed up with Thrall to defend himself against human invaders(led by Jaina's dad mind you), same with Voljin- hence why Orcs, Trolls and Tauren have a close bond in the horde as a defensive pact. Undead on the other hand are just kinda lumped in there the same way the night elves are for alliance.
---
Sidenotes: Fuck Worgen stupid wolf man idiot, Fuck Pandaren they should've stayed as joke mobs, I'm still upset over no playable ogres, Mangletooth deserved better in Cataclysm than to become a generic quest mob
---
He's pointing out that your sentence is contradictory.
---
Jap das ist HS aber wenn du denkst es ist nicht 95/5 dann lebst du woanders, sorry
---
As a new player I have no clue what the whole battleground thing is about exept I do know there is capture the flag lol at first I thought it was just two premade teams pvping in a arena with pillars and what not to take advantage of terrain and los type stuff.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwpyjv/what_the_new_knowledge_about_weapon_skill_means/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
a bit of constructive criticism (I hope): don't throw shield up against NPCs unless you're actually being interrupted/pushed back, it's horribly inefficent even compared to renew.
---
quite a few priest leveling guides recommend them for some reason, which is a great way to make a bad habit muscle memory.
---
I used cleaver from 43 to 60, though to be fair at ~58 i swapped to prot and just spammed dungeons haha
---
Doesn't excuse forsaken committing genocide against entire villages with civillins in Hillsbrad.
---
What server are you on? Warrior disc has a list of all the crafters on each server
---
What's wrong with 99? I'm comparing the best of feral druids to the best of other classes.
---
I'm pretty sure the people you mention are actually enjoying the thing they're doing, and they do it for fun. I wouldn't say an 18hr/day grind can be more fun than just pvp'ing like normal for someone who fucking loves pvp even.
---
Please keep us Oceanics to ourselves. I dont want to join 300ms Battlegrounds.
---
Pretty fun server I play alliance. Not too unbalanced either
---
What's the faction ratio now on Flamelash?
---
Oggrimar is absolutely THE horde capital.   For alliance it's kinda split between SW and IF on most servers.  Yeah UC and TB aren't abandoned, but Ogg is the undisputed capital.
---
This isn’t your forum, so people can post what they want, not just what you want. I know, that’s a tough lesson for millennials to learn, that the whole damn earth doesn’t revolve around their wants and needs.
---
No, tanks wear full threat gear almost all the time in decent guilds
---
Doesn't stack. It refreshes. :)
---
You still haven't really won the fight though, you've just stalled until the lock gets bored and leaves.
---
Haha yea no it's funny how things can get interpreted in different ways, and I don't think you can change it unfortunately. But I bet if you remade thread with a different title you'd be getting upvoted. Good luck my friend!
---
BiS for ferals for most content actually as threat is important. I use it often with my threat set.
---
Might ease up a bit once BG's start. I'd wait and see how that plays out.
---
Really good for enhance in PvP but in PvE spinal reaper is still better due to Orc racial
---
The guy could have 20 days played across his characters.
---
That’s 60 x 8 hour work days, 2 months worth of work ($15K?), several years worth of leave or however else he chooses to value it. Would you “chalk it up as a loss and move on” if the manufacturer of your car just decided not to address a critical issue and left you with an undriveable hunk of metal?
---
Damn it! I am second in line for our eye to drop. So far we have had 1 ingot drop so I am not hopeful.
---
Ya we rerolled from herod to incendius week 2 after already being 60 and it's a  goldilocks server.
---
Horde have slightly more numbers but alliance are generally more organized. Yang gang.. maybe Atlas is the only ok horde guild where alliance has several.
---
God I tried to tell people #Nochanges was stupid and no one listened 
---
The really messed up part is blizzard is completely refusing anyone from transferring now, and I bet you more then anything they’re probably going to present us with paid server transfers and call it a day... for a problem that they should really take responsibility for I think.
---
You can’t even unsubscribe and let them know why you’re doing it since they took the feedback away from it.
---
Blizzard really doesn’t care like they used to anymore... their customer service went down the drain after they fired a lot of their staff.
---
Oh can I not have to invest \~13 days of game play and my time to get to 60 with that?
---
ofc it's a hordie claiming this isn't worth discussing
---
I use Shift-Q, Shift-W and Shift-E
---
Yeah 54-46 is good as it gets
---
Well lets try it! What would you suggest the title to be?
---
Oof. I’m pretty sure Feign and Vanish are the only two things that will force break combat. Everything else is just threat mitigation. 
---
You could soulstone. Gives you one extra life at least!
---
People want world PvP with BGs available. Even if they dont know it, that's what they want.
---
Those unexpected, mostly fair, impromptu fights in the world? That's a PvP server with BGs introduced.
---
If you are an outlaw organization like the Defias, poverty in Westfall (or human lands in general) just means a larger population base from which to recruit angry and disaffected people. Them being gullible and stupid and not understanding you are the source of their misery seems like a negative but is actually a big positive: you don't want smart people in your organization. You want enforcers and thugs who will be brutal to your enemies and thus increase your power. You want peons who will follow your orders without question.
---
Where’s the karma in that???
---
They actually outnumber us when we raid there and no we don't feel bad.  In order to rank up you need honor.  In order to get honor you need to get kills.  In order to get kills you need opponents.
---
And at least in IF alliance CHOOSE to participate
---
Honestly there's no reason for it not to be. On a PvP server it's insanely important and even for PvE activities it helps make your times more efficient. Farming, going to instances, etc. All adds up over time.
---
Single most important purchase end game IMO and will literally never be replaced the entire game.
---
The hero we need
---
This. The fights are actually really easy I think people just overthink them and get nervous.
---
Weapon skill doesnt affect pvp?
---
I think you would appreciate path of exile
---
Everquest actually briefly had a program on the sullon zek server to let players control low level trash mobs called project M (for monster).
---
Makes me insanely happy I rolled on a PvE server knowing this was going to be a shit show.
---
It's not like the tier bonus HAS to effect pvp. Just because you can't think of some way to balance the two, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
---
Lol, that’s how you can tell somebody never played Vanilla. Getting random buffs at all times is as natural as watching the sun rise. My favorite though was getting an Arcane Intellect buff on my rogue. I still said thanks though, lol.
---
Yeah if I had to guess I'd say its about a 2:1 ratio. I think the alliance side is about as stable as it's gonna be though. The people that stuck around are mostly here for good. I know my guild is.
---
Probably overhealing.  I never had any mana issues.
---
Sometimes you can use it to make people die from fall dmg if you buff them before they hit the ground lol.
---
I love and am unsurprised that horde are as big of assholes to their own faction
---
I wouldn't put any enchants on anything you will not be using at 60, and at that point just save / buy Crusader when you get pre-bis weapons :) so don't bother with those enchants atm unless they are really dirt cheap, imho.
---
The upgrades you want to look for depend on your race, swords / maces for Humans, axes for Orcs and daggers / swords / axes for the rest (with Edgemaster's or similar +weapon skill items, of course).
---
The reason why you literally want to make absolutely **sure** you can be swinging a weapon you have at least 305 weapon skill with is because it gives you 3% hit **AND** increases your white swing damage significantly, which is a huge part of your damage in Classic.
---
Check the [Warrior DPS BiS List](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/warrior-dps-pve-gear-best-in-slot) for a ton of weapon suggestions of all kinds, happy grinding!
---
Lol why is a faction queue so farfetched to you?
---
&gt; The main question is how will they proceed after Naxx, after TBC?
---
I'll be waiting until we hit "Classic Cataclysm".
---
Or when youre about to take fall damage, i.e Zeppelin
---
There are so-called safespots in dungeons where mobs reset and you leave combat. It's best to watch a guide for the specific instance you're trying to farm.
---
&gt;"You think you do, but you don't."
---
Guess you didn't then, lmfao. Activision-Blizzard were right on this one.
---
Jee laughter caught me off guard.
---
Stop, just stop... It's already dead! It's already deaaaaad!
---
I know it opens the door to the library but haven't tested others, some people say it doesn't work on certain DM doors.
---
Yeah I recently hit 60 on my druid and got him his first mount, an epic one. Travel form is so close to 60% mount speed and has no cast/can be used in combat that it really is much of a muchness 99% of the time. 
---
But classes that aren't druids or shammies? Yeah that's a little rough. The STV and felwood runs would be brutal.
---
Ok that's true
---
He doesnt seem to be salty at all to me, I dont know what you 2 are smoking.
---
How do you know he’s specced pom though?
---
Yeah, pvp servers weren't like this at the time, so I naively thought I'd have a similar experience. Didn't really take into account how much more massive the population is now vs then either making the problem far worse lol
---
But climbing mount Everest requires skill, extreme physical fitness, and is incredibly dangerous. Overcoming all of that is the achievement. 
---
Rank 14 you literally just have to sit in a chair all day for months. There is no skill or obstacle to overcome, it's purely a time investment.
---
To bad I resisted your stun and now am going to punt you across the zone.
---
You're actually not going far enough IMO. You're leaving out a very important consideration, which is the opportunity cost of doing the rank 14 grind. Those 18hrs a day you're spending grinding honor, are 18hrs of the day that are spent doing something that adds little to no value to your life. There are literally millions of other things you could be doing that are more enjoyable and/or more beneficial to your life. You're missing out on 18hrs/day of your life for several months, it's not something your normal, everyday person could even attempt to do.
---
Clicking abilities in a PvP video.
---
Hey thats me :). Getting a sense of the horde population in Orgrimmar is a bit difficult because they are so spread out, and are not contained strictly in the city center like the alliance are by enemy raids. But I thought it would be cool to give people on my server who aren't stealthies, and people elsewhere, an idea of the difference between the two.
---
Keep pretending your 40/60 server is Flamelash.
---
is it 300 "people" or 300 toons?
---
because if the 30 remaining alliance can all grind Honor, while they also have alts, then it's possible for them all to still get rank 14, right?
---
On the plus side, if the problem is that the servers are overpopulated... Well that's a self-correcting problem that isn't it.
---
Nope, I quit
---
Here is the Build I've been messing with for last two weeks.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZf0tZVMgzcuo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZf0tZVMgzcuo)
---
Ok, thank you
---
100%
---
Pretending that Blizzard didnt directly cause this and then saying "lol morons blame blizz I dont even know what to tell them" just makes me disregard anything else you say pertaining to this game. It's military-grade stupid.
---
For hunters? It takes us like 54 agi to get 1% crt compared to rogues who need i think 26, and warriors who need like 18
---
The only ability for hunters that scales are multi shot and aimed shot, but they also add a flat amount of damage, unlike say bloodthirst which scales 100% with AP
---
Rogues suffer from the same problem, SS and Eve only scale off AP but not that hard. While fury gets more damage, so it gets more rage which means more rage which feed back loops
---
rogues and hunters...don't. My hunter sitting at 30% means way less because 30% of my damage is weighed down by my pet, who doesn't scale AT ALL. But they can't buff hunter damage because hunter's are actually crazy good in pvp
---
I’m the guild master of a raiding guild and we’ve been using DKP. Everything has gone smoothly so far I’m just trying to get a list of items like the choker of rag so that we can use light loot counseling to determine who can viably bid on it without hurting raid progression.
---
The bidding system and the prices of the items are not the issue at hand it’s more just a precaution to make sure somebody doesn’t get something that’s virtually useless in their hands versus that’s giving it to a class who could very much benefit from it like for example imagine if a hunter were to get thunder fury
---
Alliance have such better pvp racials their losing.
---
Horde did a great job making sure no one would want to play there
---
Kind of lashing out aren't ya bud? Not like he's the one killing your toon, it's not a bad suggestion to take a break. BGs are out Tuesday, and you can always play another game... what did you play for the 15years Classic wasn't out?
---
That's weird, as someone who rolled a holy paladin expecting to be a unicorn and get invited to all the groups, I'm shocked by how many paladins there are around (Heartseeker US)
---
Yeah but he isn't getting exalted with AV for quite a while, and now he's done. 
---
It's not the most effective way sure but it's fun to do things differently. I hit 60 on my druid last week and first thing I did was jump on the epic mount I had sitting in my bag for 10 levels. I could have easily afforded the level 40 mount as well but it was just fun to level without one.
---
Granted travel form factored heavily in to that decision. I wouldn't do it on anything other than a druid/shammie.
---
Lmao yup
---
Oh, no, and competitively it’s beyond big brain, but still morally grey.
---
Perhaps, but you also wouldnt stay on a server where you are outnumbered 3 to 1. Nobody would if there's an option to move to a more balanced server.
---
Hmmm, maybe something like "when you get jumped 2v1 but you're a shadow priest" or "solo player turns the tables on a group of gankers" or something like that
---
This is what a lot of people seem to miss.
---
Lets take a mega server that has population of 8000 and 40:60 A/H ratio. This means that as alliance you can play with 3200 other players.
---
Now look at a "dumpster low pop" PvE server with population of only 4000 but a 80:20 A/H ratio. Guess how many players you can play with? Yeah the same 3200.
---
This "dumpster" server has more or the same amount of alliance as the biggest mega server out there. 
---
And since its a PvE server you are most likely going to have easier time finding groups since people arent PvP'ing as much.
---
I remember this.  I wish they had made 10, 20 and 40 person raids so that guilds could have organized their core 40 with the option of doing 4x10 2x20 raids.
---
Sir. SIR. It is you who are the one with the hurt feelings. You have been summarily owned I suggest not being a corn cob.
---
Name?
---
It becomes difficult to manage the players with the dynamic nature of a battleground of that size.
---
I would recommend having a squad leader for every 5-10 players have these guys call commands for their group(s) with the raid leader pushing the overall goal.
---
People are mentioning the book, and they're right, but this also happened in BFA, during the Horde war campaign quest line.  It doesn't go very well.
---
Ah, I'll have to play through that then, thanks.
---
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD COME BACK
---
As others have said, pet stay is critical. Keep your pet away from you so you can't both get nova'd. Free action potion will help a lot. Keep viper sting up and use nades / scatter to interrupt poly on your pet and to keep them at range as best you can. It's a tough fight if the mage is good.
---
Right? It's crazy. This is a relationship between a giant corporation with tons of moving parts and their paying customer base, but people want to boil it down like it's a petty squabble between two individuals.
---
That's reddit though, I guess.
---
been raiding MC for months and still use hypnotic blade
---
yeah, this is wrong. AP scaling is important for BT more than your melee scaling
---
crit cap is unreachable in classic gear of any tier, you're going to be within the same small crit range always. its not like you're comparing 30 crit to 70 crit so you can model it linearly. technically yes, in good gear its like 29.9 crit vs 30.1 crit or something else negligible
---
I get your point but its not like they could attack stormwind or something
---
Whoa, Gnomes and Dwarves are easily the two best looking races.
---
I do agree that blaming players for their self-interested behavior is a bad idea.  The issue is players are taking this the complete other way and blaming blizzard for player behavior, which makes even less sense to me.  Blizzard COULD solve the problem, but those solutions are usually punitive against players.  I don't like the idea of straight punishing players through faction queues, but something needs to be done to address the issue regarding the open world gank squads.
---
&gt;People did not mean they wanted the same experience, they only wanted the same game, and new experiences, largely realizing that it would be different in today's meta.
---
This is the part I do wholeheartedly disagree with.  I don't know when it started, from as soon as I first remember seeing people nostalgic for vanilla they have cited an existence of a game I never experienced.  They would talk about how much they enjoyed world pvp, except in reality blizzard CONSTANTLY tried to get world pvp to be more of a thing.  It was no where near as prevalent as those people seemed to think it was.  In times this mythology was created of how great vanilla was.
---
By and large I don't think these people wanted "vanilla with a modern meta".  What they wanted was vanilla where only THEY know the modern meta.  They wanted to go back to a game they now understood and could wreck people.  They wanted an idea of a game that never really existed.
---
You'd have to be a literal idiot if you think spending 16hrs a day on a video game is not wasting time.
---
&gt; leatherworking sucks and provides no real benefit. If you want crafted LW gear just buy it off the AH.
---
Well about half the stuff I'm wearing is stuff I've made, and I'm still saving for a mount, so buying from the AH seems like a non-option until after 40.
---
They played within the rules of the game. The fault lies entirely with Blizzard.
---
Yeah man I learned the same thing the hard way. I tanked my way to 60 and when I got there I found out my guild already had 2 main tanks and half a dozen DPS warriors. I decided to reroll paladin since they didn't have any of those at the time.
---
I got too used to the retail ratio.
---
Those damn kobolds have been sneaking into Goldshire and stealing our candles!
---
It’s pve, so at least the horde won’t be griefed
---
Big problem with tanks is you go from 5 and 10 man groups where tanks are 20% of the group to 40 man raids where tanks are 5% of the group.  For other classes the ratio stays similar but for tanks there is a drastic drop in their demand.  Also, you know, most guild designate main tanks early on.
---
You might want to start working on a dps set.
---
Also it was Lady Prestor that heavily influenced the decision to not pay them. We know how that turned out.
---
I started on a PvP server (as Horde though) because friends want to roll on one. Ended up rerolling on a PvE after taking a break for over a month simply because I don't have the time to deal with the inconveniences that PvP can create because I simply don't have that much time to play and when I do, I don't want to deal with corpse runs while trying to just get questing done. 
---
Also, I'm just a passive person in general so not really into killing people who aren't able to fight back just because I can. If I want to PvP, I would rather do a battleground where other people want to do the same thing. World PvP has never been that fun anyways considering most of the encounters are usually an uneven match of some sort. Rarely is it even
---
"Your life" lol. Like you will do this forever 😂
---
This guy just said it was lol
---
Just sit inside SM, I know people that did that during launch when no honor was even around.
---
A key problem that everyone needs to acknowledge is the SERVER SIZE.  Populations are WAY TOO HIGH.
---
And the main sub is dedicated to memes and bullshit. 
---
Your sub shouldnt have the majority of relevant content delegated to a Daily Questions thread with dozens of low effort, bullshit posts cluttering up your Hot page.
---
This isn't the first Reddit experiment.
---
It isnt. We are all aware Blizzard is shit at managing the faction balance on servers. And we have multiple threads about Flamelash on the front page already.
---
lmaooo
---
Not half empty,  still about 70% full.
---
This logic is so dumb. 
---
Do you honestly think the horde pvpers think it's fun to gank the same player over and over?
---
If all of the alliance except two guilds sits in Ironforge instead of pvp there is a shortage of alliance in world pvp, which means ganking the same player over is better for honor than running around 15 minutes looking for another player.
---
That is what causes the griefing.
---
I'm absolutely certain you will find the same pattern on every single pvp realm with a big faction imbalance.
---
It's was exacerbated on flamelash because horde had a big portion of pvpers while the alliance had very few.
---
Millenials lmfao
---
&gt; spent doing something that adds little to no value to your life.  
---
&gt; millions of other things you could be doing that are more enjoyable and/or more beneficial 
---
These statements are meaningless. There is no opportunity cost there, to the people who are THAT dedicated to a grind they already know requires that much effort, that is clearly the thing they want to do the most, for whatever reason. It adds enjoyment and possibly fulfillment, even if it's not personally enjoyable to you.
---
It boggles my mind too, it 's such a braindead, skill-less task, but to a lot of people playing any amount of video games is a waste of time, so I'd think that us gamers should know better than to tell people "this doesn't add value to your life / isn't beneficial, don't do it".
---
I got my first 3k last raid. Toep and arcane is real spicy.
---
Kromcrush?
---
Not even honor, just lulz, in many cases
---
Def don't recommend Kirtonos. You need at least 5 to go to any flight path, and at least 10 to go to any relevant flight path. The Menethil boats are a horde transport.
---
I guess we'll see what we would do if that happens. no point getting worked up over something that's gonna take place in 7+ months.
---
That’s a side effect of them not being able to play. They hang out here and complain instead. I really don’t blame them though, which is why I always roll PvE. I tried rolling PvP on Mal’ganis back in the day and got roflstomped and camped as soon as I entered Ashenvale. Being miserable so somebody else could enjoy themselves wasn’t for me, so if I want to PvP now I run Battlegrounds.
---
I hit exalted with both the Stormpike and Silverwing, so it’s not like I don’t PvP, I just prefer it on my terms not some sadistic sperg’s.
---
Is anyone else bored with level 60?
---
I had an AMAZING time level to 60, but that I am here I don't enjoy much of the game. I got bored raiding MC. It's both too easy and too long. I don't enjoy pvp much because raiding spec takes all the fun away from my class. I would be at such a giant disadvantage having much worse gear than anyone, I don't see the point in not raiding. I tried to play my alt but I just got so overwhelmed by having to spend 3 more actual days of my life playing a game I don't even know if I will enjoy. I don't like world pvp even though I'm horde, I do see that complaint with the game here.
---
 I hate retail.
---
Anyways, sorry to be so negative. I just had so much fun getting to 60, maybe I am just missing something now that I am in endgame.
---
That still doesn’t work. The Alliance are all human with a twist. Gnomes and Dwarves are shorter humans, Elves are taller with pointy ears. Orcs, Tauren and Trolls are all monstrous. With the closest to humans in there being the Orcs. And nature? Pre legion Orcs fit perfectly with Darkspear and Tauren. 
---
Also most of the Alliance isn’t pro Nature. Humans, Gnomes and Dwarves are more likely to burn down a forest because it’s in their way then preach about saving this. *Cough* The Dwarves do something similar in Tauren starting zone *cough*
---
The horde though? Shamans, Loa, Druid all care about their environment so they would be directly freaking out about issues with nature.
---
Realistically Night Elves and Forsaken should be on the opposite factions. But Blizz decided otherwise.
---
Exactly, and the sad part is they could be using those 16hrs/day to make changes in their lives, but instead the cycle continues...
---
If a mob has to be friendly to one faction to count, what quests are we thinking of?
---
Point me to where someone from flamelash horde complains about alliance doing the same?
---
I saw and went through something like this on a smaller private realm. Population was really low, so when the PvPers logged, all BGs would stop. Problem was there were horde players who wanted to keep playing, so they would force bgs by queuing on alliance alts, but purposefully throw games. So if you were an alliance trying to rank, you would have to join these games that were being purposefully thrown or youd miss rank. 
---
Eventually all alliance pvp players agreed to stop queuing for bgs entirely until the horde stopped, and it eventually worked. Moral is that with a community based game like classic wow, you cant go overboard and kill your own server. I think on today's age of relatively anonymous gaming where lobbies are random generated and servers are phased at will people don't get that. Theyre not used to continuous server communities like youd find back when wow launched where people had their particular CS servers or SC BW chat rooms or clans. 
---
So this will be a good cautionary tale of what griefing can do. You CAN literally kill your own server by being obnoxiously toxic. You CAN kill a server by purposefully choosing an imbalanced faction server. 
---
And in the end, its no fun.
---
My vanilla horde Druid did this. At 45 someone gave me a kodo in my guild so I could ride to instances and stuff with them, but I stubbornly waited and my epic mount was a wolf.
---
I was so proud.
---
What server are you on man?
---
Or when hes doing rokhdelar
---
All are equally doable at 60 without any special gear.  Theres really no need to try to get an extra 10 stat points or whatever before trying one of them. They are all easy if you have a group that knows the pulls
---
Same. I went Pvp because thats what I loved in vanilla. Wish I had taken my group to a PvE server instead because it's been utter shit since phase 2 dropped.
---
If "griefing" is the way to get the most honor, that's what people will do.
---
It's not very hard to understand.
---
Ashbringer is one of the only decent ally realms with maybe a  slight ally ratio and we get horde players qq. After being on horde raped servers I rolled on ashbringer and I've been ganking every single horde I see.
---
&gt;  blood plague incident in vanilla
---
I had to look it up. That was hilarious
---
That’s what a Warchief CAN do.
---
It’s not what Thrall did.
---
The big three (Cairne, Voljin, Thrall) are the ones who will listen to people and let their opinions mater. Garosh and Sylvanas are not.
---
That's essentially mafia ethos. It's "protection money." It's not ethical either way you look at it.
---
Believe you are hosed, stick to the global channels as much as possible
---
Bummer that clip doesn’t seem to work anymore. Got any other clips of this guy?
---
Sure, whatever makes you feel better
---
Ah so that kind of horde server I see
---
Rank 4 and 8 HT + Rejuv is enough for 95% of situations.  
---
Rest is covered by NS or Swiftmend.  
---
Regrow cost ~660 mana, that's too much for fresh starter.
---
One part of it, the other reason was that the horde side of flamelash had a massive amount of pvpers, while the alliance side was only two or three guilds.
---
About 4% alliance
---
The server size is the #1 issue. When my 40 man raid comes through BRM we aren't running into 20-40 people camping BRM we're running into 150-200.
---
That would never have happened in vanilla. The populations weren't high enough to support it.  With the insanely large servers Blizzard rolled out you have no counter.
---
The #2 issue is the current WoW culture. The vast majority of servers in Vanilla were balanced or at least close to it.  That is not ture of PvP servers in Classic.
---
The only way to win in a mmo is to make the other guys log off. So yes...
---
If you like it go for it, I will prefer the dragonscale set but every one have his taste
---
Incendius is high pop so he must mean roll a new character.
---
Should actually be 75 AP, I believe warriors get a 1:1 Agi-AP ratio, and a 2:1 Str-AP ratio.
---
How does it work?
---
I still hurt
---
I'd rather have that then giving it to our Guild/Raid leader 2 weeks ago who quit the game this week
---
It's not sarcasm though. The alliance in open world pvp on Flamelash was so sparse that corpsecamping was the best way to gain honor.
---
It works so long as your pet disengages too.
