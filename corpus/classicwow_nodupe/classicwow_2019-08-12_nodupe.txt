Elaborate?
---
---
---
Sort of  but that's not actually a viable strategy for most people. It's like any economy if your making more money than the people producing, someone is getting screwed.
---
Yeah, I’m on that subreddit right now, I see a couple posts that could be taken as “mean” but to insinuate that the private server scene is the most toxic community in gaming just because we want a feature that is going to ruin the classic experience out of the game is an *extreme* reach and ultimately helping nobody.
---
The only content creators I've seen not actively trolling the situation and addressing what is a real issue here.  Hope this catches Blizzard's attention maybe moreso than our bitching on this subreddit.
---
Blizzards track record points to no fix before launch. This is how it will be come the 27th
---
welcome to /r/classicwow
---
Yeah people definitely wont do this for lotus spawns or rich thorium or other things. definitely not. there's no way this could ever be abused.
---
Don’t be dumb. There is a difference between being faction camped and fanboy camped.
---
Yea that sucks.  What you are describing is lame harassment/abuse.  What are you going to do? Seems like RPPvE is your best option. You can flag for PvP and entice the opposing faction for your game purposes. Since they are on an RP realm as well they may understand and play along as it were.
---
Do what I've been doing, use the wowhead character model dressing room and memorise what you want your character to look like.
---
unrealistic if you are slow yes.
---
Most streamers haven't been on pvp servers in years.
---

---
BFA doesn't even have pvp/pve servers, just warmode, which most streamers either don't turn on, or it doesn't matter if they do because crz makes it impossible to target streamers.
---
That wasn’t the point I was making. The fact you still think this is about me is really confusing. It’s like you’re not even reading. This has nothing to do about me or how many viewers I have. I don’t stream.
---
Hopefully they remove layering after a "Few" weeks after launch like they said.
---
Ah was that a thing in 1.12?
---
Are you spamming this into every layering post? If so you are not really helping the situation
---
&gt; it was laggy as fuck, and unplayable.
---
Even the instances?
---
The expense is not in the actual CPU core count. It’s in the licensing that goes into SQL for each core which is ludicrous.
---
Sharding is actually better, at least that can be turned off and on by a zone by zone basis
---
Oh boy, this conversation again! You'd think the tears of the children and conspiracy theorists would have drowned them all by now.
---
Then why is there multiple videos showing this not to be the case?
---
Anything with cc or healing is fine since that is a warriors weakness while leveling. Definitely should never level "tank" it's slow and for no benefit since you can tank as a dps spec.
---
Nostalrius is a terrible comparison. That was a megaserver and had like 3-5 times the size of healthy peak population. Yes to a vanilla-like experience, no to a pserver-like experience.  
---
    
---
2500-4000 good  
---
10000+ bad
---
There has to be a better way. I have no idea why people are so against the idea of merging servers. Seems like a much better solution that wouldn't actually impact gameplay like this. I am shocked that people in general are okay with sharding.  I know it's going to be removed after \~1 month, but still. It feels like it will have such a negative impact on the classic experience.
---
My only issue is, I can't decide on which CE pet to start with! Oh the humanity :(
---
Honestly. I think the trilogy would be best.
---
But let us copy characters over (Once). 
---
We get the old world. We get the complete Warcraft 3 story line. The classes fleshed out. The old raids are still challenging and need full groups to handle and old world materials are still worth something. We'll have paladins and shamans on both factions, draenei and blood elves. 
---
And with the character copy, you can play the version you want AND Blizzard would kick Classic/TBC/Wrath servers out.
---
Only problems: A lot of different servers and split playerbase.
---
added in patch 1.12 yes
---
yes and they know what warmode is like they understand they can't just toggle off their pvp mode on a pvp server. They fully know what they are getting into and they are choosing it on purpose.
---
Then why even have a ToS?
---
If I reach PvP Rank 11 as a gnome, will I be able to purchase and ride the "Reins of the Black War Tiger (Old PvP)" or will this not be available in classic wow?
---

Focus your hatred on sharding in classic. This isn't worth our time.
---
Priest

Not in result or solution. It's all the same as far as what happens and how you handle it.
---
Mean bro lets have a yarn and game some classic g right after i have a hangi with my pukeko cuzzie
---
YOU are in it for the long game. Blizzard wants as many people to be in it for the long game as possible. A slightly more empty world for a few weeks is massively better than a queue to even play in the first place.
---
&gt;you think it's a "vanilla recreation" only if players that have played the game before play it
---
no? where did you read that from?
---
i think adding layering/ loot destribution and similar modern systems for convenience MIGHT change the game in a negative way to the point where its no longer vanilla.
---
i think the people who keep pushing for these changes are mostly the new faces in our community.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;**The original vanilla experience was what it was because everyone was new.**
---
im not talking about the new player experience. im talking about the game. the systems, the design, the mechanics, the ui, the server organization, the dungeons.
---
they are not part of the nostalgia argument. they are just good. without any extras they are extremely good.
---
The tourists will notice and think "oh this is just like every other instanced 'MMO' these days, lame."
---
FIN
---
yes
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I mean we've heard this since the Blizzcon demo. They're just testing... it's not even beta yet! And then we get the beta, and layering turns out to be broken and abusable in many ways, and then continues to be broken throughout all the stress tests.
---
&gt; We're about 2 weeks out from launch now and still the only thing Blizzard has said about layering since its initial announcement is that they cranked it up a bit during beta because there were so few players. It's about damn time we put some pressure on Blizzard to actually communicate about this.
---
"They can't" ... This is exactly why they have paid developers on staff.
---
Name makes a very big difference when it's the only thing to make a choice on. That's marketing for ya.
---
Wow that whole video was informative, thanks!
---
Also it got us Classic
---
Keep this shit on the blizzard forums. This sub has devolved into too many vigilante-esque posts.
---
Also, big difference between a single event taking place and possible weeks of server grief by streamers saying not a damn word to their legion of gen z retards.
---
How can they have market research on a game that doesn’t exist yet?
---
Dang incels man
---
I'd probably go something that can also heal, like a druid or priest, but then put everything into dps talents.  Shadow priests are pretty nasty damage dealers, balance druids ain't bad before endgame (which you have no interest in).
---
You sound perfect for our guild. One night a week mandatory raiding. The other nights are your to pvp or grind or do Dad things lol. Pm if you want to know more.
---
You realize name res lasts until launch right?
---
**Option 1**
---
One server with 3 layers
---
Layer 1 - 4,500 players
---
Layer 2 - 4,200 players
---
Layer 3 - 3,800 players
---
Total people you can potentially interact with on your server - 12,500
---
Total people left per server with ~70% attrition - 3,750
---
**Option 2**
---
Three servers with no layers
---
Server 1 - 4,500 players
---
Server 2 - 4,200 players
---
Server 3 - 3,800 players
---
Total people you can potentially interact with on your server - ~4200
---
Total people left per server with ~70% attrition - ~1260
---
Tell me again how layering isolates the community more?
---
&gt;Quietly joins a PvE server with little worry about 90% of all these issues.
---
Or....they lied.
---
Couldn't you just reserve a name on the two est pvp realms and then when the game is launched choose the server that the streamers dont roll on?
---
whats wrong with janitors?
---
And you think this screenshot was taken during the first hour of the stress test when it's at it's peak population? Very very VERY doubtful.
---
Just remove it now, put another(or 2) type of each server in every time zone and be done with it.
---
What a stupid ass thing to do, y’all are going to ruin classic for yourselves by making your life revolve around streamers.
---
&gt; but they are no different than us.
---
If you think the Fortnite crowd isn't any different than us in terms of retention you're insane.  They barely stick to ANYTHING long enough to matter unless the streamer du jour tells them to.  If Asmon or that Ninja guy tell them to go back to Minecraft or Apex or whatever they will.
---
You could always go Priest. Shadow is great for levelling and until you start using shadow form, you can throw the odd renew on brother.
---
And if you both want to do a dungeon you already have a tank and a healer. It would take mere seconds to find 3 DPS to go with you.
---
I agree our retail servers are a mess
---
Just an ordinary boar (gas cloud). But watch out - that’s no ordinary boar (gas cloud)!
---
With the extremely low number of servers I am not counting on it being removed.
---
If you're in [this guild](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/133132905458171904/582758777321816086/unknown.png), you're not exactly the sort people want to be around anyway. c:
---
6 of 1   or 1/2 dozen of another,
---
I don’t see how. There is not a single way to reasonably do world bosses with layering. It is just not possible.
---
The thing is that hunters, warlocks and mages are very good at solo levelling (ESPECIALLY hunters and warlocks), while healers and warriors struggle with the speed at which they can get things done, so a tank/healer combo means the warrior can go all out harder with heals and additional damage from the healer. It's a very symbiotic relationship. 
---
By playing one of those 3, you'll likely be levelling slower than you would otherwise, but if your goal is to have fun with your friend and you aren't worried about that, then go for it!
---
Better if he does though
---
2
---
2 is the minimum.
---
No it's not the fanboys will dog you for weeks where as the faction stuff ends in hours if that
---
&gt; But there is no good that can come from layering
---
Besides things like:
---
People being able to play the game on launch day
---
People being able to play the game on launch day, and actually be able to do something
---
Condense populations for that MMO feel as the playerbase inevitably declines.
---
&gt; having to start the game 3 days later because of over population in the starting zones would have been a significantly better result
---
Subjective AF, and based on the trajectory of design, the majority disagrees!
---
&gt; the value of having a rare vendor recipe
---
Do you play this game?
---
Tell me how you can exploit layering to get a flask recipe.
---
Iirc it is 3-12
---
Guild mate flipped a coin
---
Everything from 1-12 letters will be free to take.
---
3, letter minimum, nowhere in a name can you have 3 consecutive letters aswel.
---
mages are better solo farmers from being able to aoe grind but you’ll likely hit 60 first on the hunter as many aoe grinding areas will be contested. you likely wont have any issues with gold with either class so do what you like.
---
"B b but muh server!"
---
Just login to the stress test server as it’s west coast.  I get ~78 ping connecting from Detroit.
---
This is actually very true. I remember being like 10 and my brother ninjad me a piece of loot because it was my birthday and we were terrified we'd be blacklisted from the server
---
Priest or Pally
---
Yup I’m in as well. Someone put this together. I have a couple hours each night as well (PST). It would be nice to be in a guild with casuals. Plus we might be able to pick a time to run something like WC that might take our whole night if playing 😂
---
Herod's community doesn't even exist yet. The servers don't go up for two weeks and even then how are you polling the whole server for input on this idea.
---
Keep the staff for melee backup if you OOM. Body slot items don't really do jack at that gear level so you're safe to vendor everything you're wearing.
---
The only real way to do Launch is going to be to practice your 1-12 or higher if you can, know the route and all of the quests in that level bracket, and be able to make judgement calls on the fly. Navak and I started out miserably on the OC realm when it launched. We were somewhere down in the thousands but, because we know the route and the quests by heart, we were able to make some on the fly calls about quest order and break out of the pack to finish 3 and 4.
---
We need to find Demonspike, Guild leader of Unleashed as well as Shinoda and Tatari, welders of the blessed blade.
---
(I would cry out of sheer joy)
---
Sweatin buckets up and down the street?
---
Oh stop it you! 😚
---
If its really west coast thats crazy because I get 21 ping but if I do the pacific coast ping test listed elsewhere I get 60
---
KILLAH QUEEN!
---
What rule did I break? I never said anything which would violate the rules of their discord server, and I was never warned about any behavior.
---
Don't you need it for the ZG 3 piece?
---
Mages and warlocks only spam 1 ability in raids which is level 60 endgame content. If you just want to have fun levelling mage is a great class with lots of abilities to use.
---
Paladin or shaman works great with warrior.
---
This post is probably too contentious to be left up. The censorship in this sub is really heavy.
---
&gt;That article puts forward some good evidence 
---
no, this is stupid cherrypicked bullshit
---
Layering keeps glitching like this it'll wreck classic
---
No, it would be "15 years later and Blizzard still can't plan for a launch." Except they are planning. Thanks to layering, I will get to be a part of a smooth launch and play the game!
---
Then ban everyone who abused it
---
That's just sad.
---
Haha shit that’s what’s up! I’m playing alliance and I’m 24 too. PvP server?
---
I’m not laughing
---
the point is not that there are no people in the city, you can see the /who orgrimmar in these screenshots/clips. the problem is they are all spread out to different layers...
---
You really are ignorant. Look up words before you use them.
---
Data centers are in Los Angeles and Chicago.  If that's what you're asking.  Outside of that I think Blizzard uses a cloud host with ATT?
---
I don't understand why everyone thinks an emptier game world is a worse option than 6-hour queues. Actually playing the game is _objectively_ better than not being able to play at all.
---
I don't recommend this macro. For the case you are about to drop combat against someone who is chasing you for example. If you spam this macro to set a trap as soon as you drop combat, you'll use FD instead and that's not what you wanted to do.
---
You'll need tiger riding I believe.
---
Main reason is you dont have a ranged attack.  Grenades are your primary range pull.
---
Ahh brilliant mate, I like you!
---
Thanks for the info! I've included that in the table! :)
---
Listen, I am really not defending Blizzard, but they have already been quoted as saying beta (and presumably, this stress test) that the layering thresholds are insanely low so that they can test it.
---
I will be the first person with a pitchfork if what we're getting now is what we'll see on release.
---
Thats the problem. You (and many other like yourself who are quick to dismiss it) dont properly understand the issue, and how layering solves it.
---
Layering creates different "layers" of a server for you to play on and can expand to create as many of these as needed for the more players that try Classic to start, then further down the line as many of those players dont stick with it, it allows for layers to be removed as necessary. The whole time your playing on your server and seeing your servers community just split into different layers.
---
Try to read: https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
60, not sure if that's gonna be terrible or not
---
Thanks for the link! I've included that in my post in case anyone else is interested! :)
---
It’s not even being an “Apologist.” It’s called common sense. The game isn’t even out yet and people are already bad mouthing blizzard about it. They confirmed it will be removed by Phase 2 and if there’s still too many people consistently playing then they’ll make more servers.
---
True but it's a pro if you want blacksmithing
---
A week ago I added the starter account to my old account. When I downloaded the game and logged in, I could see my old characters even though they couldn’t be played (the ones over level 20). So you could do this and log into each account and see for yourself. 
---
All of my characters had to be renamed so that might be why you can’t see your names on the forum.
---
lmao what are you talking about? I was correcting your blatantly wrong claim, not saying Blizzard should open new "merged" servers for Classic.
---
You'd name the servers Proudmoore-1, Proudmoore-2 etc., not just merge any random servers. Almost every other MMO already does this to deal with population.
---
That's why I said camped obviously too much. If the same dude camps you 3 days in a row in different zones hes probably sniping. I'm just saying all this can be avoided by just not playing the same server. Almost all of them agreed to play on the same one so only 1 servers community is messed up.
---
it's 2 not sure why I wrote 1.
---
Pretty edgy take, don't cut yourself.
---
If you go warlock or hunter, you want the pet to tank and your bro to deal damage, as you have better sustain for the pet.
---
BC and Wrath servers are being discussed as part of the World of Warcraft Trilogy
---
Not really, Ret uses Wisdom from the moment they get it and the points are better spent in the Mana reduction on Judgement/Seals long-term.
---
I was thinking of putting Savage Gladiator Chain in the pre-bis lists instead. Is it any harder to farm than the blue drops from the other bosses, like Ban'thok Sash? I was under the impression it was, but I don't know.
---
Hmm. I didn't consider Hunters might get lower priority for Dal'Rend's than melee, but that makes sense. I put Dreadforge Retaliator in the pre-bis list instead.
---
Thank
---
Did that but then I rejected the choice I got aswell. So in thinking mage is easier so level that first and finance my warrior after
---
They said "only starting zones" then now its everwhere and "only to phase 2". We'll just have to deal with an inferior wow experience than vanilla was.
---
Mate I’ve been a part of it since about 2007, it’s more than a couple of posts.
---
Google wowscape and read into that shitshow. It was at the time the biggest private server by a long margin.
---
Quick, upvote before the mods delete this thread. Being anti-layering is not accepted here
---
Even under 18 I think this type of behavior seems a bit much. Just makes me think that most of these kids don't have very healthy social behavior.
---
*cries in horde*
---
Thank you for the response to every question friend! Leaning pretty heavily towards orc or undead rogue :)
---
You don't eeven kknow what layering is
---
Ill take que times
---
It's available on wowinterface.com and curseforge.com.
---
nice!
---
&gt; into faster paced matches with a shorter and more dynamic laning stage 
---
That describes modern raiding well. Its a lot faster paced, much harder and shorter.
---
Classic Mage rotation was just spamming frostbolt. Modern mages have a bunch of procs to track while also having to move around a lot more than they used to to deal with mechanics.
---
Awesome, thank you for the reply!
---
yep.  wouldve loved to be playing through that right now
---
Dont act like you k ow layering will be around till phase 2. Nobody knows how long it will be around but they said they will remove when the surge of people drop off
---
I think the only thing we do know is that Thalnos is going to be the unofficial BR server. I could be remembering wrong though
---
[removed]
---
I'm simply looking for the addon that turns the entire spell icon red when you're out of range rather than just the hotkey turning red.
---
did you not see the videos going around of people being layered from their group mid combat?
---
If so it would be handy if they indicated which Layer you or others in chat were on. Had someone advertising a rare in the Barrens but I saw neither them nor the rare when I went there alone, despite their continued messages.

Tomorrow, 6PM EST.

They do counter-bans you do know. If you appeal a ticket for a fraudulent auto-ban triggered from mass reports, they will go after the reporters if they think it was abuse.
---
Not frostmourne though. Screw those guys.
---
It's not a problem if we can all just learn to get along, geez.
---
Can't they just tweak the parameter that triggers the layer formation? Instead of getting rid of layering altogether?
---
yes but coordinating with our "guilds" we're making etc is a nightmare
---
6 hour ques would only be around for 1-2 days TOPS though. And I would be perfectly fine with layering being there for only a few days or even a week to deal with just that.
---
The biggest concern is that we have gotten a nebulous "few weeks to months" response from blizzard on this, I dont think anyone would have an issue if they said "the moment people spread out enough we will shut it down"
---
Well said
---
Lol
---
A quick 4 question survey when you open the client would be epic for statistics lol
---
What if the world boss spawned on every layer but as soon as it's killed on one layer it's removed on the rest of them?  
---
Yes, that would suck, but it's the only way I could see layered world bosses working.
---
Imagine listening to general chat, just give us the authentic version.
---
They have already said they are removing it by phase 2. 
---
You also have a weird perspective. Layering isn't something you "have to deal with." You don't need to have any interaction with it at all. It's in the background unless you want to try and exploit the mechanic itself.
---
In all reality, you aren't dealing with layering, layering is dealing with you. The huge surge and following die-off isn't a straightforward problem to solve, but layering gets us there in 1 piece. Could it be better? Of course, the answer to that question is rarely no, however I sure haven't seen a better solution offered on these forums, nor would I expect to, as the people making the decisions are paid to do this and people here are not.
---
That's how I felt when I went back to live. Leveled an undead warrior to 50 for shits and giggles and only met one other person out in the wild.
---
Which they have yet to announce, all this drama wouldnt be going on if they just licked a server
---
You suffer from serious brain damage if that is your response.
---
If you're mind controlled it makes some sense at least tho.
---
In truth, they did! My character and pet obviously were still alive lol
---
Blizzard needs to remove layering before the WoW Classic launch
---
Yeah I'm sure the two EU-English PvP realms will have 50k people per layer. They're just testing lower thresholds.
---
I felt pretty cool with my full Tier .5 set..
---
I suppose that is the point of the post eh?
---
What’s the average time it takes to level to 60 for the average person that only plays 2 hours a day max?
---
So the Anal game doesn't get played anymore?
---
I think this article was pretty misleading. Every time I was on the stress test, people were everywhere
---
Complete open world dominance. They made it basically impossible for a guy to finish scarab lord on a recent private server because they didn't like his guild.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjG4UpuL84M
---
Is there a better reason to roll hunter than this video?
---
Yes. You now get layered during fights, while in a group etc. ...
---
Yes
---
Capital cities are empty on a STRESS TEST. You know, when the entire point is to put as many people into an area as possible. 
---
The time to fix these layering issues isn't during a stress test, it was during the lvl40 beta months ago, the one where we got to watch streamers play. People that think these issues will be fixed in 2 weeks are the same people that thought BFA issues would be fixed before release.
---
Solution: literally just roll on an rp server, they’re all gonna be on big pvp servers. It’ll work out way better
---
Because you're switched between layers. If you want to find someone you have to engage in a technical act of switching layers, disrupting immersion. It's horrific.
---
How do you kill a zerg?
---
**But the real question is:**
---
If an undead dies, is he dead or un-dead?
---
Haha the translations may be a bit weird, but yea it's like "Nice meeting you again" or rather "Thank you for the last time..".  
---
It's a Norwegian word but works for both Swedes and Danes alike!  
---
If you're wondering about any phrases, feel free to hit me up!
---
&gt; More realms that end up being merged is at its core the same as layering
---
Correct.
---
Except minus all the bugs and potential for abuse. Just leaving that minor detail out apparently.
---
Mage only spam frostbolt in endgame content. Prior to that you can use your full toolkit, polymorph, fireball, fire blast, frost nova. It doesn't really synergise well but you can probably have a lot of fun. They may be the most played but Warlock and Hunter won't be far behind.
---
Love the ground clutter. They did a great job with it.
---
Thank you so much for making my day.
---
The best part of this is the guy (Payo?) who is asking those guys' guild leader to get them to stop and the guild leader says no. So satisfying.
---
Why would anyone want gold for a trash game such as BFA?
---
I thought there was a blue post addressing all these issues? Pretty sure there is a CD on phasing that goes up the more you do it.
---
There used to be an alliance rogue on my server in 04-05 named Chuck Norris that went around ganking horde lowbies in the Barrens.
---
Realms with forced mergers later on. Offer free transfer away (if people want to). However, forced realm mergers are necessary to keep the initial community together. Otherwise, when everyone parts their way with optional transfers the community is fragmented and same layering effect occurs.
---
EXAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTLY. Like, you try to pick one, and you end up with 21381209348123 Europeans from everywhere on the other... It's gonna be a mixed bunch/bag anyway you put it. In fact, Shazzrah now seems so specialized, it seems more diverse LMAO.
---
Hablas espanol?
---
I think you are missing something. You are using the huge queue on the EU realm as an example as to why the statement doesn't translate well, but the screenshot was most likely taken late into the stress test when people had already done their "testing" and it probably wasn't very populated regardless.
---
Let's hope that they're only trying things out during this stress test (hence why it's been up all weekend) and fine tuning it for launch.
---
I'm not a dad but am a student who works as well  I'd be playing Wow 1-3 hours a day at best assuming it's the only game I play (which it won't). If love to play with some dads. I'll be on on an est pvp server
---
&gt;about 2 or 3 weeks into the server launch, the population was spread out enough that things weren't insane in lower level zones
---
Well then I guess it's too bad Layering doesn't care what zone you're in. Whole continents will be layered, so it doesn't matter what level everyone is.
---
with the alternative being...so bring attention so they fix it?
---
Which is irrelevant because the reason Blizzard doesnt do merges is because they make money from transfers.
---
But sure whatever you and everyone downvoting can be wrong.
---
&gt; Wonders who OP is talking to when he says "We".
---
Literally everyone for the past months up until this weekend, probably.
---
I was looking at Mankrik for Alliance.  My vanilla experience was a 70/30 Alliance server, me being Alliance.  I thought being part of a smaller population might bring some interesting challenges.
---
Hopefully this makes it to.the blizzard forums and gets upvoted...
---
I'd rather have queues, more servers, clusterfuck in starting zones and potential merges than some unauthentic retail nu version of vanilla......... it forsakes what made this game addictive for some bullshit ease of access / qol changes
---
A bit of a small sample size there don't you think?
---
Man fuck layering...
---
Its funny you have to pay to play on a server that isn't really a server..
---
Fucking upgrade your shit blizzard and make Real servers again. Sharding/layering w/e fuck that shit. Cheap fucks.
---
Yeah bfa release omg. Id be in wpvp and people would disappear mid fight
---
Working college students unite! Hmu if you go for an east coast pvp realm
---
Sniping is the way of the land when you ANNOUNCE your location.
---
What abuse?
---
You mean like farming 2-4x as many mats and have them all in the same economy like what would happen when you merge servers?
---
Me - "Play Orc Warlock, you've never played Orc, and you've always wanted a Warlock, imagine dotting everybody in AV!"
---
Also Me -"But my Undead Mage...."
---
nah, that's just them trying to give us the real vanilla experience.
---
Someone’s probably answered this already but why not just do it like RuneScape? Each realm has several layers that open up and you can choose which layer you go to. 30min CD on switching layers.
---
Theres a setting to switch the graphics back to classic isnt there?
---
Its literally sharding
---
Female Tauren Hunter named Milkme it is then!
---
This whole layering shit just makes me angry at this point. Seriously kills my hype.
---
Why not both?
---
no one is complaining about sharding at start/starting locations ... but about too big population after sharding(layers) is turned off ... number of servers currently  presented is too low to  hold tens of thousands of players or more
---
but the cities are not actually empty /who showed 100+ people, they were just scattered arround all the layers. the problem is not that there are no players, the problem is you don't see them despite them being there.
---
thanks
---
That makes sense. Just make a CD for switching layers. Easy.
---
actually talked to Esfand, that statement is false
---
did blizz actually say that? because on live there are est servers located in LA
---
I always play a healing class with a tank to guarantee you can find groups for things. My favorite is a priest, but really any of the healing hybrid classes can be fun.
---
I’m confused.  This discussion is about WoW Classic, not private servers.
---
No, people have not assumed it. It has been stated by Blizzard that for better or worse they are collapsing every layer after phase 1. Go watch their interviews from when they had all the streamers and whatnot in Irvine before spouting your literal assumptions as gospel on reddit.
---
Odds are they aren’t afking outside of the auction house and are instead grabbing/turning in quests, seeing profession trainers, or grabbing new spells from their class trainers. 
---
I’m not doubting that there’s people on other layers, but basing your data off of a 3 day stress test with a level 15 cap is not valid data.
---
Stuff like this is why streamers are making the blacklist. If you dont want to play with streamers dont play the 1 server they all agreed to play together.. not hard.
---
I’ve been checking this regularly and I’m starting to think it’s not going to be up-to-date when name reservation goes live (not the website’s fault). 
---
Not sure whether to spread my three name reservations across different servers or just risk going with one..

That's fair, really hoping that that is the case and launch is a different experience.
---
right. but on live there are EST servers hosted in LA. not sure if thats the case for classic
---
Hard to say. Classic is a grind to reach max level, with the average /played time to 60 is roughly 5-7 days. It all depends on your class, playstyle and commitment
---
And ? Why are you under this assumption that you should see other people in low populated areas? Layering splits up the servers evenly in to population, big population areas become smaller, small population areas become empty. That's how it's supposed to work.

I'd say if you aren't a potato and don't run into any major problems, 4 months is a good time. That's assuming 10 days /played.
---
This.
---
250~ hours time played is the estimated average on private servers. So 250 / 2 = 125 days.

60 warrior and hunter. Was a retarded middlschooler that didn't know what I was doing. I mostly did AV all day on my warrior and somehow got to Knight-Lieutenant rank.

Not just slow, unrealistic unless you are above-average minimal. It's best if you are super fast
---
Savage Gladiator Chain has a slightly lower drop rate than the blue items, but it's not awful. Good call with the Retaliator.

I know the basics. Market research isn't looking at the demographics of the current players, it's (as the name suggests) research into a market. It's about the prices of current products in the target market and how well they're selling; is a £10 sub fee competitive or does it need to be increased/ decreased? It's about what customers want from a game and how that differs country to country, demographic to demographic; are there going to be enough players in the Oceania region to warrant servers there, how many servers is EU going to need? It's about market trends; are video game prices going up or down, what do players want from a game these days and how has that changed since 2004? In short, it's about analysing your product and figuring out how it fits in to the market and it's done *way* before it's actually released.
---
I know right, I don't even care about PVP but I don't want to miss out on the "full" classic experience.
---
Now that you mention it, I can't remember ever seeing a female tauren hunter.
---
No.. it's a form of entertainment for thousands of others who dont have the time or skill to play games at a high level.. not a tool for you to be an asshole.
---
Brb, telling my co-workers to fuck right off on Monday.
---
Oh wait, I'm an adult that realizes when I am working I can't act like a child.
---
probably something like 3 months?
---
 That would mean that 1 in 10,000 people who bought the box at launch actually played the game?
---
you didn't tell me how that helps with dying servers and i don't know why you believe i don't understand what layering it

Whitemane might be the "4chan server", looks like Fairbanks is for the boys :)

---
i hope ur kidding, if not i don't think there is a base for a discussion.
---
/u/wormed had a good point here. Hopefully they are correct.  
---
&gt; Listen, I am really not defending Blizzard, but they have already been quoted as saying beta (and presumably, this stress test) that the layering thresholds are insanely low so that they can test it.
---
&gt; I will be the first person with a pitchfork if what we're getting now is what we'll see on release.
---
Layering is going to be the death of this game if they dont fix it. People want the open world pvp and the high community content.
---
Personally, I used to play in a server that had an underpopulated Horde side, and it was honestly so much better than alliance. 
---
By this, I mean, it was nice to have a small community because everyone knew each other for the most part. That, and shorter que times for bgs. I'm not sure how this will play out in Classic though, but I hope it's similar.
---
I'm not gonna do much.
---
Layering is absolutely something we have to 'deal with' if it affects the zone around you: mobs, players, nodes. It also has a detrimental effect on the public's perception of the game. I'd rather deal with overpopulation than an empty zone on a server with 3500 people on it, or a glorified loading screen every time I enter a new area.
---
they're not going for 3k per server from launch. I hate layering but there is no way around it except for zone based layering for the initial launch phase.
---
Bruh the rest of south and central America should also go thalnos then lmao. Plenty of Brazilians also speak Spanish
---
When I say "quit when BC was released", it wasn't a day after or anything.  Actually a better way to put when I quit was "Wrath was announced".  I played BC, got to lvl 70, got some decent gear, then WotLK was announced.  In my eye, I worked my ass off in the game to be one of the top geared hunters on my server, BC came out and made my gear a joke, I worked through it and started to make my way to being towards the top again and Blizzard announces they're going to do it again in a year.  That's when I said the game could chortle my balls (as did about half my guild).  Back in vanilla, we farmed MC, Onyxia, and BWL.  Adding new areas, higher levels, higher gear, harder dungeons sounded awesome.  It was the way they ignored the Raid sets.  If they had boosted the stats of the Raid sets (Tier 1 and 2) and made them gain a bit of stats as you leveled, that would be different.  At lvl 70 the Tier 2 set should have been like the 3rd/4th best set you could have (they added a couple sets, having like a lvl 65 and lvl 70 quest to upgrade the stats on Tier 2 would have been nice) instead of being trash like it was.
---
I don't know how they handled any of the other expansions, but the first one was done wrong.  I know people who have played and still play since then.  They were not around during vanilla and do not comprehend a 40-man raid on MC, or anything it seems.  To them, there is no need for 40 people in any raid and MC is pointless because it offers nothing worth raiding.  That's the problem, Blizzard destroyed the original content to add stuff, made most of vanilla achievements pointless.
---
Count on the weekends for getting ahead.
---
Was just wondering where the servers were physically located because on live wow time zones are not indicative of their location and never have been.
---
20x light leather sells for 3s
---
Yes I've been listening to this all week!
---
Bloodvine is really nice, but ZG isn't out until Phase 2
---
For leveling going marksmanship is meant to pull aggro away from your pet a lot more, so I've read.
---
Have never tried it myself, only BM. With a bear because it seems tanky and can eat anything. Slower than cat vs normal mobs though, but maybe it can tank elites better.
---
It still ruins the whole point of having a realm community, though. If I see Bob the Orc leveling in the Barrens, I want to see Bob the Orc in a month when he's level 60!

Look at that trade channel tho. So refreshing
---
They're not exactly calling it. They're just trying to split the community in a way that's logical and beneficial for all.
---
ya I seriously don't get it, he's a freaking tool.
---
Sounds like briefing, blizz, ban?
---
u need to keep one thing in mind: 1 match of dota is essentially is lvl 1-60 into raiding in wow terms, all in 40 minutes.
---
so u kinda cannot compare modern wow or w/e to dota because in a modern expansion u do not start at 0, but u do in dota. every single match. so imagine classic wow from 1.2 to naxx being a dota match. u start lvl 1 and kelthuzad is hyperlategame. what happens in wow in like a year or more needs to happen in lets say 40-60 min in Dota.
---
the laning stage in dota is a bit faster paced nowadays (which is btw to the greatest part influenced by people just being flat out better than 5 or more years ago, a modern top dota team would CRUSH any opposition from the games infancy), but essentially thats what makes for more exciting games to watch. the teamfights, the clutch plays. nobody wants to watch 2 teams afk farming like it would be LoL. 
---
what im trying to get at is this: in WoW they made things faster to appease the casuals who wanted easier acces to everything. in dota they made things faster because it makes for a better spectator experience, and dota is at its core a spectator sport (which WoW DEFO isnt).
---
sry the rambling
---
Nice !
---
I wish I was on your layer. I just learned that my insurance doesn't cover arson. D=
---
LOL, give me a break. Streamers are abusing the games they play, and ruining it for players. Sniping is AOKAY.
---
They can get a real job.
---
I installed Classic today and it was less than 3gb.
---
Yeah pve oceanic looks pretty shaky.
---
They're also a team of humans. They'll pick the best option they think they have, but they might be wrong. So far, though, they've shown that they'll fix mistakes they make.
---
...You're completely missing the point.
---
I'm saying that layering is unnecessary past the 3rd week or so.
---
Viewers are not co-workers..... Just because someone works in entertainment doesn't mean they have to deal with people treating them like trash.

I got female dwarf shadow priest. That is a next level snowflake character.

This is the best part, I'm fuckall away from you guys and I'm getting screwed over as well as increasing the degree to which you are being screwed.
---
fear trinket
---
I eventually went over to marksmanship when I spotted Aimed Shot in the tree. Had a cat for most of my leveling and it was never a problem really, taunt works well!
---
Got a buff gorilla when I got to STV though, purely for the looks, but he could take a solid beating too!
---
This was so aussie I couldnt understand a word of it.
---
I merged my old account just before the stress just so I could talk in forums.  Was from a decade ago so no email attached.  After they merged it they added 3 days for me also to check out old characters even though I subbed already on my account I had made with no warcraft attached initially.  Cool on their part just to see some of my old guys.
---
3k per server? Are they launching 50 more servers I haven't heard of?
---
Imagine being a 16 year old hopping into Classic WoW for the first time. You have never played any iteration of WoW before. Enter a major city for the first time. To trade with people you  have to leave my parties and join them because you are  not in their shard. To join a pvp raid on the city you have to do this as well. The city only has about 25 people in it because of sharding. Feels dead. Seems like no one plays this game even though a ton are. Heard a ton of this community stuff but fail to see 90% of the players. Also when I go in and out of zones (which is how it currently is in the stress test) you see players, mobs, and NPCs fade in and out. People are abusing layering to get loot.
---
I would probably quit.
---
Still looking for Alliance guild with HEAVY PvP focus (44...rank 13 in vanilla) BC Season 1 to 3 Glad 4 Rival. Playing Lock. PM me
---
I'm probably going to make a char on the 3 realms they didn't mention being Herod, Faerlina, and Whitemane.
---
I did a little charting and breakout on this information. This is a simple Pivot Chart / Table analysis. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KLSyj5O.png) [Pivot Chart for responses to WoWClassic Subreddit](https://i.imgur.com/S4QpCua.png)
---
the file is 3 gigs. My 2010 macbook air toaster computer that freezes up playing castle crashers and minecraft can run this.
---
LOL
---
Comparing a screenshot of Nost shutting down and the whole servers population piling into cities to a stress test where people are out leveling and gain almost nothing from being in the city? seems a bit of a harsh way to go about it. Yes layering is a problem but at least do fair comparisons.
---
Ugh. I hope i never have to hear about streamers or this crap after release lol
---
Lmao i'd rather play fucking BFA 16 hours a day in a russian prison  
---
At least there I wouldn't have to pretend when i'm being dicked down by a sweaty dude on a 10 year old mattress
---
The spawn rate was definitely pretty wonky. Sometimes I'd be running around for 40+ seconds looking for a mob, and other times I'd experience just like what the video got: A mob instantly respawning on top of me.
---
Warcraft 3 seems to hit the spot for me. I never did get around to finishing Frozen Throne.
---
So entertainers get a pass to be dicks but no one else does? You get fired for that shit in ANY other job.
---
I'm not trying to be rude here but do you realize that you're giving them a pass for doing nothing but playing a video game? Do you really think everyone is upset with this or no reason at all?
---
If this is still an issue at release then bitch and moan all you want, it'd be warranted. Just don't do it during a beta test of the game. This is the time for testing and finding issues, not the time to be expect the game to be defect-free. If this issue still happens at release then go crazy, until then I think this is people just being outraged for the sake of being outraged.
---
All of those things are less authentic than layering. Also your already getting a clusterfuck in the starting zone.
---
Some people live for grieving others and the salt it produces, and having live recordings of their reactions just makes it that much better. There were already going to be dedicated grief guilds, now they have a common enemy. Some people just want to watch shit burn, in this case streamers. There are people who do this IRL too, cause grief just for the sake of it.
---
The 'anti streamers' don't need to take out the streamers zerg, just the streamer. They can effectively do this with 5 people vs a zerg of 200 with the right class comps and consumables (stealth classes and engineering/alch consumes mostly).
---
I for one can't wait to see the content this produces. If 1000 people truly organize they can keep someone camped 24/7 in shifts, some streamers will lose their cool and drop the stream personality in rage and frustration.
---
Yep, best part is shaman dying and calling him so bad.
---
Did you click save after complete? It really should be working at this point.
---
Name one. That is typically the exact same thing as a layering strategy, not separate servers.
---
Many MMOs spin up extra instances of a server to handle population spikes.
---
5 was a world record, not the average. my first character was 20. I think 10 is a plausible number if you know what you're doing.
---
&gt; He's your average youtube/gamer bro "conservative" who gets all their opinions from the youtubers specifically catering to "their beliefs,"

It's already got attention its constantly on the front page. At this point it's just spam
---
Were you able to change to 3x4? I can't figure it out.
---
Lol you *were* cool in that set dude, Tier 0.5 cost a fuckton of time and a fuckton of gold to get, you earned that.
---
Hopefully Blizzard realizes it needs to be changed somehow. Btw one minor thing:
---
&gt; Stormwind on this “High Population” realm is even more dead than retail, which is saying something...
---
Stormwind is actually quite populated in BFA, since it's the major capital city with the portal room. Ironforge in BFA is pretty much dead, like the photo you showed in the Classic Stress test.
---
Was stormscale the ”scandinavian” server in vanilla?
---
&gt;  if the game launches like this
---
that's how people can defend it. It's not the launch, it's a beta test.
---
You mean like they stated for layering in retail originally?
---
Well, now we know the Spanish and Scandinavians are rolling on Shaz I'm a bit more conflicted.
---
That’s from June. And they would never take info from that anyway unless they’re idiots. The entire purpose is just to make feel like they matter.
---
0 surprise, blizzard is prepared
---
IF the community aspect stays the same as it was 12 years ago, I never had any problems finding people willing to lend a hand. The game is so difficult to solo at points that you are bound to need to group for things that other people need. Throwing up a question in general chat should be fine. Trade chat in major cities will be more troll-ish I’m sure but you’ll still find help there.
---
If someone makes you something for free, unlocks a chest, mage gives conjured food, portals you someplace, etc. tipping was standard back in the day. So hopefully that decency still stands. 
---
I honestly don’t think you’ll have any issues with ragers as being /ignored from most people on a server is a very real thing. Just be sure to let your group know you’re new if you do a dungeon as they may be expecting a retail seasoned vet with halfway decent skills. They’ll be more lenient and accepting.
---
Tldr: Tip people who help, report ninja looters to trade chat, be open with your limitations to your group.
---
Ohhhh. Gotcha. Yeah it’s hilarious, Blizz is actually retarded, what did you expect?
---
Yeah you guys were alliance. I remember Unleashed well
---
Ah yes, someone who clearly has lots of experience actually playing on rp servers and not just meowing about moonguard. I see you are a man who does not leap to assumptions or ever strawman

I’m out of the loop. How are people playing classic right now? I thought the stress test was over and release is a couple of weeks away. Thanks
---
Mankrik ftw
---
oh so you watch him then? so not a typical left wing nut thats parroting what your told to think? ya.....ok
---
Giving FR and DE as many servers as they do with English servers is just absolutely idiotic. 
---
I mean generally, 2 servers for English is just ridiculously low - English servers will have English speakers and also *everyone who has no localized server*. 
---
The stress tests showed reports of 100k people online - and that's only the people with ultra-hype who would pay knowing their characters will be deleted. It's going to be queue simulator 2019
---
That guy wasn't kidding about reserving Pagle server for Alliance only.
---
Alliance Female Night Elf Fire Mage  
---
Well now I'm not so confused.
---
Assic Wow
---
That you can shift+click on a name in chat to see what lvl they are and where.
---
For a long time I thought I had to add them to friends to see their level.
---
Like I said, unless you're somehow able to get through the crowd of people following them 24/7, undetected(meaning you're a rogue only), and you're able to stun them and also kill them before they, or one of the many people following them, stuns you and kills you, then that is absolutely not gonna happen. It would quite literally take a miracle and/or a really good distraction. Even if it was able to be pulled off once, it likely would not work a second time.
---
I don't know, I don't play retail or pay attention to what they may have stated when they added it in.
---
As I already said though, if they do a 180 on that statement, the playerbase will be 100% justified in shitting all over Blizzard and calling them on their hypocrisy, which would be bad for business.
---
He re-dead.
---
It may be a trivial fix. They might even have the fix already done, but aren't updating the stress test with the fix. This is normal for software development. Wait and see if it happens on launch, and if it does, THEN we can get our panties in a twist.
---
Bobs a G if hes getting to 60 in a month. 
---
I get that tho. I agree
---
nah, do it. There will be some new people, I'm sure. People would cut you some slack back in the day. I don't know for sure it will be that way, but I think it will.
---
The game has a long built-in ramp up, too. Learn (e.g. by doing 5-man dungeons) as you are leveling up, and you'll be fine by the time you reach the level cap and people start caring how you perform.
---
Nost was laggy and near unplayable but the servers which have come after nost have achieved similar numbers with actual stability and without lag.
---
People obsessed with streamers are more fucking annoying than the streamer's fanboys.
---
&gt; I see you are a man who does not leap to assumptions or ever strawman
---
Thanks man.
---
You should give it a try.  While you're more or less right that "everyone else already knows what to do" and that does probably mean you'll make some mistakes and get lost and take extra time reaching the level cap, that's not a bad thing.  Actually, that's exactly the experience that "everyone else" is desperate for because it's freaking awesome and you can only have it once.  
---
There will definitely be people who will be irritated that you don't know "basics" like how they want you to assign your talent points or what skills they think you should be using when; the internet is full of asshats and WoW is no exception.  But really, screw those guys.  None of that matters until level 60.  Be up front with other players that you interact with that you never played retail.  Many people would be happy to play with someone who is just learning the game like we all were back when.  
---
Also, in case you didn't know, the game is really fun to play.  So there's that.
---
Im down to join Alliance side in order to bring balance. Ideally would choose horde :). In addition:  I work at a Long Island City based Craft Brewery that can be used as a meetup location for  the alliance and horde guilds. I have the freedom to do whatever kind of event and hosting a once a month Classic WoW night at the brewery seems fun. I would be able to setup drink/food specials and maybe get the other local breweries (5 nearby) to join in. I envision having Classic WoW PvP tournaments with prizes and giveaways and evolve it into a full E-Sports Brewery League. Anyone interested in helping? How cool would that be?
---
I'm looking to form an Alliance guild of players like you (and myself) on whichever EST server has the fewest toxic streamers, based on http://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
Planned play time (note: not raid time for awhile): 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM EST 4 nights a week.
---
i got human male beastmaster hunter.....i dont think that works in classsic
---
Layering bad.
---
This makes me sad. I was so looking forward to getting to ogrimmar for the first time since tbc launch and seeing it full of people. /sigh
---
I get what your point is but you're not making it very well with that weird as fuck analogy.
---
Yeah that makes sense my guild is basically saying to make names on two realms and once we know where the streamers are going pick the opposite realm, so it's not really a huge issue I think since you can just reserve two names on two realms.
---
How do you feel about the murlocs in westfall that cast frost nova or the ones that throw nets? 
---
No escape for you! get beat on by 3-4 murlocs while they chain spam frost nova.
---
So is there valid market research on a game similar to Classic in 2019? No.
---
Thanks for answering your question for me.
---
If mods delete this they are the problem with classic.
---
**What is layering?**
---
Layers are virtual servers **the same size** as what a server limit would have been.
---
This makes the "I would rather have layers than fight over quests with 500 people" crowd especially retarded, as laters do **nothing** to remedy this. With layers there will still be 500 people per popular race starting zone.
---
Layers are basically scalable extra servers, at a very slight convenience over more actual servers.
---
"What's the alternative?" "wAhT aBoUt mAi NaMeZ?" You might say if you managed to rub your glorious two brain cells together.
---
Well that would be resolved easily by having groups of servers per region and type that share naming limitations.
---
Example: East coast could have 20 PvP servers, with names limited by groups of 5, and within those groups of 5 whenever 2 dropped below thresholds they could be seemlessly and automatically merged.
---
"bUt WhAtS ThE dIfFeReNcE bEtWeEn ThIs aNd LaYeRs?" You may ask if you literally are incapable of critical thought.
---
Well to answer: with layers, the active players you interact with slip in and out of your game world and is extremely immersion and community breaking.
---
With this proposal, the active people you leveled with and play with **will never change**. From a players perspective you will never have friends in a different game world, just suddenly a large injection of new players will appear. That may be slightly disorienting, but no where close to what layers will do to the game.
---
The only discernable reason layers exist is the same reason people still don't know what layering is: people (including classic developers) can and will be stupid, and still make it into decision making positions through nepotism.
---
Layering is only downside vs intelligent forethought and more physical servers, as the alternative is just as automatic and hands off as layering is intended to be.
---
&gt; you don't want to compete for mobs with 500 other players in the Valley of Trials
---
The hell I don't.

I’d say shadow priest based on what you’ve written

A.K.A anything that offends our Blizz overlords will be removed. Gonna need a /r/realclassicwow subreddit or something with moderators that aren't afraid of allowing criticism.
---
Yeah. I have my issues with layering like anyone else but this comment thread is filled with irrational circle jerking
---
haha, didn't spot that one! I edited one that was in use for BFA and didn't know nelves could even be mages now.
---
Maybe you should not be condescending under the guise of a question? You're conflating ganking and systematically ensuring a certain player is incapable of playing the game. Context matters. Imagine thinking grammar isn't important.
---
Ive seen other blue posts saying gsnking lowbies isnt against the rules either... hmmmm
---
Do you think I should start playing BFA to get the hang of it? Or is it completely different and not worth the time?
---
Yeah I'm looking for this too. I was tempted to do a PvP realm but I'm leaning towards PvE just because I'm going to have so little time.
---
Yeah, at some point you have to face the reality that being willing to act like a piece of shit "for the chat" all day every day already kind of makes you a piece of shit, even if it's pretend.
---
yeah a few combos I didn't realise had been added. good spot.
---
That's actually not what he said. Layering is primarily FOR starting zones due to huge influx but it is not - and has never been said to have been - specifically and limited to starting zones. This is so wrong, I have no idea where you got that from.
---
People have been theorizing Devilsaur issues due to layering and you're thinking he said it was limited to starting zones?
---
Put them in and leave them forever, no big deal.  If someone likes that look what's the harm?  Not like it makes you faster than other people it's just a skin.
---
Fair dinkum, mate.
---
https://github.com/tullamods/tullaRange
---
The layering is bad. The "low population" server is like playing by yourself.
---
But then wouldnt he get stream sniped
---
When one of the most important parts of WORLD of Warcraft is the WORLD...then yes. This is exactly the shit that's missing from retail that makes it a hollow shell.
---
Plenty of people capped all classes at 60. I myself had all alliance classes and also 3 horde.  Now not all had gear but still it wasn't super rare.
---
YoU thinK You waNT thAT buT YoU doNT
---
1) Rogues aren't that good in dungeons compared to other classes. But they're gods in PvP, both solo and team-based, and the second-best class for DPS in raid groups. They're hyper-competitive, though, and have a lot of competition.
---
2) Orcs makes the best hunters and warlocks for PvP. Stun resistance is debateable the best PvP racial, and because of Undead, Alliance tends to have less Warlocks, rendering the Undead racial less effective overall. If I were making a Horde rogue, warlock, or hunter, it'd probably be Orc.
---
3) Skinning/Herb/Mining are good, safe professions to take early on, and great for making a bit of money. Engineering is the best for personal performance, if that's what you're after.
---
4) Not healing as a healer class will probably make a lot of people mad at you, and make it harder to find groups. But they obviously can't force you.
---
Somewhat. T1 shaman gear doesn't have +dmg on it, but there's a few offset pieces that nobody else will want to fill the gaps. If you can get into BWL guild and get some t2 you'll fare a lot better as it has a lot more +dmg.
---
Is this the "authentic classic experience" Blizzard keeps advertising everywhere? How does layering even remotely fit into that? It's so antithetical to Classic, and deliberately so. What the hell?
---
Inb4 massive shitstorm once people see this work in action on launch.
---
_explicitly signs up for beta testing agreeing that there will be bugs and issues and this isn't what launch will look like_
---
_spends a month bitching and moaning like a crying child because the beta isn't flawless_
---
Every. Fucking. Time.
---
Another lie by the trash company, who would've thought. The fact that people are still defending this is mindboggling.
---
You apparently didn't spot a lot of them.  
---
Troll druid? Monks?
---
Also Luke Skywalker I guess :(
---
This is what confuses me about classic.  It sounds like certain classes / specs were by general agreement in a bad place.    
---
Are they going to try and balance those classes, or just “sorry, it sucked in the past so we have no choice but for it to suck now”?
---
ban streamer and everyone that reported, then free name change 
---
so hard...
---
Yep lol.  That's the only way it would work IMO.
---
See. There we go. "Don't complain now, complain later." Then when we bitch and moan later, you say "don't complain now, complain later". I've watched it happen before. And if people stop complaining now and complain later, its gonna happen again.
---
Well I say: Bitch and moan now, so we don't have to later. Let Blizzard know this is a problem NOW so it gets fixed NOW, not later.
---
Don't worry bro it's just the beta. Don't worry bro it's just the stress test. Don't worry bro they are going to turn it off after phase 1. Don't worry broooooooooo....  it's the same song and dance for every game of all time with these huge problems before release.  Anyone who says they are just "testing it" and to wait for release will be back in here telling you not to worry bro when they are dead wrong.
---
I was 100% sure i was going to play a mage. I played warrior back in vanilla and thought id change it up. On the most recent stress test i rolled a warrior for fun, oh boy was that a mistake.  I was pvping for hours on hours, and now im so lost on what to play.
---
No but there's valid market on a game exactly like Classic. It's called WoW: Classic.
---
Can they also use this to say that people stream sniping and camping them are disrupting/harassing them? If they can I feel like Blizzard would be quicker to side with the people getting thousands of people to watch their game over us peons.
---
Yep, I spent my time removing belves, worgen, goblins and all the other crap I didn't remember about the additional classes given to existing races.
---
You've mentioned many things, that would require a several times longer message to reply, since you've blatanly ignored the main and key point of the conversation: gender dysphoria is a dysphoria.
---
While you admit you are uninformed about transgender people and their issue, you deny this is a problem while partaking in a conversation about transgender people and their issues, and claim for the second time that I'm obsessed with something without saying how and why. In fact, one could argue that you are the one obsessed given you've specifically came to say all this stuff to me out of the blue just for mentioning I disliked an image, it sincerely looks like you came just wanting to argue for the sake of arguing, knowing beforehand you'd disagree with anything I could say.
---
Not to mention this
---
&gt; and putting trans people on a pedestal
---
You have just told me that aknowledging the problems a group faces is putting them on a pedestal. Just imagine for a second thinking that someone who says "calling black people the N-word is bad" is putting black people on a pedestal. Just stop for a second and think over what you said.
---
Then how you mentioned transgender people not being slaves, like if you were implying that would somehow reduce the importance of a slur used against them, since I've never said the T-word has the same weight as the N-word, just that they are equivalents (disgusting slurs used against a specific demography). Not to mention that transgender people, just like black people and homosexuals, have received active discrimination and targeted crime across history and even today in many places. There are gay concentration camps Chechnya, specific anti-transgender policies and bills in western countries, deaths-quads in Brazil murdering transgender and homosexual people, etc. 
---
So mentioning blacks being slaves and denying this circumtance for transgender people does not only miss the point (transgender person facing transphobia in this particular case) but it is a completely pointless and irrelevant thing to point out since this is not a competition about who faces the worse discrimination.
---
You then said that regulating the usage of slurs is authoritarian... And even claimed that I hold any privilege whatsoever for being LGBT member, not only when anyone can report that message (I haven't, definitely), but when LGBT is exclusively comprised of minorities that have faced and face discrimination or are looked down in the whole world. It is quite ironic that while in the real world people are being namecalled, murdered and beaten for their sexuality, you claim there's any privilege to be part of it. 
---
And call the usage of slurs "disagreeing". Using a slur is not disagreeing. Disagreeing is saying you don't like a painting, or certain color, or that you prefer beans with a specific ingredient. Using the T-word is just disrespecting someone.
---
&gt; because politics isn't allowed.
---
There's absolutely nothing political about transgender people and their issues, absolutely 0. This is a basic human rights issue, not a political one. In fact, the ones claiming it is political are the ones who usually pander against it for political purposes (for example, using misinformation and ignorance to create an imaginary enemy, like with the american bathroom bills).
---
&gt; Literally every screenshot contained rude and 'harmful' language
---
And, again, you are talking about the other content like I have the obligation to talk about it, or that I should talk about what YOU prefer, instead of about what I simply want. You seem to be **obsessed** with wanting other people having the same preferences and concerns as you.
---
&gt; That's transphobic. Not all trans people are vulnerable. What a Republican thing to say.
---
Ignoring the unrelated video about homophobia in the military, this just seems like you are mocking a serious issue. I could post a thousand of data showing how vulnerable transgender people are. 
---
* The absurdly high homelessness percentage. 
---
* The number of transgender youth being disowned and thrown to the streets by their parents for coming out. 
---
* The weak economical situation in some countries, like the US, due to a combination of what I said previously and the high costs of HRT treatment. 
---
* The far higher risk of being murdered, beated or raped. 
---
* The irrational religious adversion, literally having the pope compare transgender people to mass destruction weapons.
---
* The mistaken and inherently flawed general image of transgender people by society due to [survivorship bias] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) (you only are aware of those who not pass enough and ignore or miss the existence of those who do)
---
* Discriminatory targeted bills and policies vilifying and antagonising transgender people, such as the bathroom bills or their banning from the military.
---
* Misinformation being spread on purpose, for example the missconception that gender dysphoria is a mentall illness, when [it's not] (https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/90875286)
---
&gt; Don't worry, I didn't vomit or anything 😂
---
Very mature...
---
&gt; Well I'm gay, and people call me the F-word all the time, both friends and enemies, and it's never bothered me
---
This is basically "I never did this so no one should". Your whole point seem to revolve around this; people doing what you expect and want them to do. Since you don't get offended, no one should.
---
You really don't think managers ever tell customers to fuck off? I don't know why people think they can shit talk entertainers and pro athletes but when they say something back its the end of the world.
---
I'm talking about the pre mc stuff. Not the improved version of it. The original dungeon sets.
---
I don't have to imagine, this is literally me. A 16 year old who has never played any iteration of Wow before. Pretty much everything you said is true, I was playing the stress test today and Ironforge was completely dead.
---
dead game
---
I think the issue they were alluding to is that the market will be flooded with insane amounts and when the player base drops to 3k a large majority of those materials will still be around, damaging the economy permanently. 
---
It’s a pretty complicated problem but definitely worth thinking about, this is why originally the devs said it would be ‘starting zones only and in time limited way’ but now it seems generally acceptable to be world wide and until phase 2. This is a huge difference.
---
NO CHANGES
---
You were doing pretty good up till this point, but I can't say I entirely blame you for snapping.
---
If it's any consolation to your sanity, the other guy was definitely in the wrong prior to this point.
---
This. There will be no more good argument against them. Blizz took the perfect opportunity to nip this problem in the bud and they fucked it up spectacularly. G fucking G
---
Didn't they say the same thing when they initially added it to live?
---
You do know you can add them to your friends list and know exactly where they are, right?
---
The workaround I found is to simply target the mob that is polymorphed and the timer will display correctly. Kind of defeats the purpose of the mouseover macro but it's something.
---
In the Americas Region the raw breakout for Alliance/Horde according to the form responses at 25k:  
---
This is not including a breakout of server choice.
---
People will just have to get used to it, the people complaining are just a small vocal minority. I expect more people will complain that they can’t buy and sell blizzard tokens on the auction house than people complaining about layering once the game goes live.
---
the whoel fucking point of a stress test, is to stress the layers. UH WUT?
---
LOL I am not jealous AT ALL. Wtf?
---
Eh, I would say that. An ass, maybe. Sorry, not so much.
---
It is objectively completely different, and personally I don't find it fun at all.  As a completely new player, you're still likely to get 10s of hours of enjoyment out of it.  The pace of gameplay is totally different, but the absolute basics of movement, questing, skill usage, and combat mechanics are all similar enough to classic that it probably wouldn't be time wasted.  Like learning to ride a tricycle before a bicycle or something.
---
I would not try to make comparison on a stress test. They are testing stuff internaly and Blizzard is not very vocal so we will have to wait for launch to see how this is going to be.
---
If WoW classic won't beat OSRS in player count 6 months down the road, something had gone terribly wrong.
---
500k wouldn't be a surprise to be honest. There will be both - players leaving and also an influx of new players who wanted to avoid the initial shitfest. Having played hyped up layered MMOs (like GW2) at launch, I would say that skipping the first month actually might be a good idea.
---
The experience is really hit or miss and layering brings up market inflation issue. You still fight for the same supply on the AH.
---
Not sure how you classify toxic, but it was definitely a dick head response.
---
Can I make an alliance and horde character on the same server for classic?
---
In regards to passive income, I rolled 4 toons this stress test to optimize my routes and by going out of my way at level 5 to get skinning/herbing I passively farmed and vendored enough skins (no vendoring herbs) to have around 50s by level 10 and that includes the purchase of my skills. That’s nothing to sneeze at, you make it passively, and you’ll have a nice cushion of coin.
---
My late game plan is to drop skinning and pick up alchemy and take all those herbs I saved in my bank while leveling to craft raid potions as there will be those hard core types who will give me their gold for pots.
---
I may auction instead of vendoring skins but I couldn’t really test the AH on a stress test as there’s no money in the market yet and AH may be flooded with skins and herbs early so vendoring may be cheaper.
---
That’s just my plan of attack. Not planning on getting rich, but I bet I can afford a mount at 40 doing it.
---
Bruh, I'm not a mod in that server. I'm simply pointing out that your guild isn't exactly a good one. If you don't like to be associated with it, leave that Guild.
---
It's a stress test, not live, server populations are low currently because it's a test? people are out exploring in the short time they have before the servers go down. On live there are things you need to do in cities but these aren't required pre level 15.
---
## bruh 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Stream sniped by both sides. He will get attacked by horde constantly i'm sure, but there will also probably be 25 Alliance players within 20 seconds of him at all times just afking watching his stream in case something like that happens. Other than world chat, the only person's experience that will be ruined by streamers is their own.
---
Yeah. Noodles have an actual job and purpose. 
---
(To fill mah belly.)
---
Good bot!
---
Crazy relatable. Trying to convince myself this is worth subbing for with my limited time to play. With a likeminded group I’d be game. Not swayed either way for alliance or horde. Prefer a pvp server. Live on west coast but idc about ping differences but want to avoid streamer drama.
---
shit game
---
Wasn't the whole point of layers so that you wouldn't be getting tossed around instances while playing? Am I misunderstanding the system?
---
No. It needs to be there. They have four PvP servers which means each server will probably have 20000 people on it day 1. That’s fucking stupid.
---
No no, they need to remove it entirely. I would rather have overpopulation than this immersion killing piece of shit tech
---
Except I was a druid and was usually in cat form or cheetah form.
---
Rolling Rogue this time. Better view of weapons to enchant and cooler sets. Although the T2 Druid set was amazing.
---
can this be done for the pve servers?
---
Where is the quote?
---
Me! Me! Me! It’s all about me! 
---
No one here cares that some dad gamer may have to wait a couple days to play. Keep playing retail until the rush dies down. 2 hours a day, you won’t be past level 15 by the time the rush was gone anyways.
---
But let’s sacrifice the integrity of the game for its lifetime because dad gamers with JOBS can’t stand to wait a little bit for a few days.
---
Probably best not to type like that, makes you look stupid.
---
Yeah move everything works fine! Dominos allowed me to set the keybinds and configure which bars I wanted to have, one bag also works with the b key. I got all the add ons off of the curseforge site, under the classic compatibility section.
---
I fear Pagle will be overly Alliance and I’m considering going Mankrik but afraid of the opposite.
---
Streamer bad.
---
The Spanish community really is not that big
---
Nothing better than being a middle-aged man playing a 15 year old game.
---
This honestly has me to the point of not wanting to play classic. This isn't what I signed up for. I think imma try a pserver for the first time if this is what they roll out. I'm gutted by this.
---
I got suspended in Classic for literally telling someone to "stop being a dick" when he was harassing someone in world chat. Was mid Uldaman run on my Warlock when I got a whisper from a gm saying I was being suspended and I barely had time to read it before I was kicked. Think it was a day? I forget the exact amount. One and only time I've ever been suspended but needless to say I started minding my own business if you can get suspended for telling someone to quit being a dick when they're harassing someone. 
---
YES IM STILL SALTY.
---
Disable smart firewall then try it again.
---
So the logical end there is to state your grievance on the forums for Blizzard to see, then put your money where your mouth is and actually cancel your sub if you're that ouraged over layering 6+ months down the road.
---
People bitch up a storm and say the game is dead, but then keep paying Blizzard to play it, so why would Blizzard change what they're doing?
---
I agree, there are plenty of smaller streamers that if given the backing of a game company to help promote their streams could actually be seen. I have a friend who streams fairly frequently. His content is probably B+ grade content (if I am being honest), but he rarely breaks 10 viewers because there are literally thousands of other people streaming the same game he is. Meanwhile, guys like Soda are getting paid by game companies and they treat the others in the game they are getting paid to play like total assholes.
---
Local defense channel has a call out for people to defend against a Horde raid into Alliance territory. Sounds great! On my way! Wait...I'm on a different layer and fuck all is going on here. Also, TM/SS isn't really that impactful since there are multiple TM/SS instances. So just grab an invite to one that is peaceful and opt out of the fucking world game. This breaks a major part of what made Vanilla great. The WORLD in World of Warcraft is important and layering trivializes it.
---
People don’t seem to understand that a large majority of the people playing classic will quit. It’s the same on private servers, which is why they only run single servers. The population of the servers will be incredible healthy 3 months down the line(hopefully 10k or so online at peak times), but layering is a must to prevent dead servers.
---
pve yes, pvp no
---
Don’t worry, we got windfury
---
Wait is classic out?
---
&gt;  warrior, because all I can do is yell at party members.
---
“BOW UP, MOTHAFUCKA!!!”
---
I swear there's a new meltdown here every other day.
---
80 IQ people can't see past their own noses, let alone work out long term impacts of seemingly innocuous things.
---
Need to have a anti streamer guild on every server that camps them day out and in, there is nothing against that.
---
Stress test which ends tomorrow. Name reservation tomorrow. Classic is out on the 26th 6pm est.
---
Oh yeah okay. I thought you were saying it the other way. Got it
---
spain can u pls fuck off back to italy and portugal and take APES with u? :)
---
And if we don't let blizzard know that Layering is a problem? Then they won't remove it for release. Therein lies the problem. If we don't let them know we have problems with it, they won't fix the problems...
---
There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. If we remain silent until release, and then later remain silent until another arbitrary goal post, and continue this cycle on and on until people like you deem we're finally able to complain about the problems, said problems are never going to get fixed.
---
Stress test extended till Monday
---
It was prolonged until monday
---
I’ll let them know 2 days out from server launch to add another 60 servers.
---
I would 100% prefer long queues for the first few weeks than layering for the entire leveling experience. 100%.
---
Blizzard has also said they will be looking to add more servers depending on launch numbers. They would want classic to be as successful as possible and that would mean continuing subscriptions. 
---
Server costs compared to subscription revenue is nothing, being cheap (with low server numbers) for no reason will just lose them profit. 
---
The only reason they have limited servers now is to try save communities from rapid playerbase fluctuations, so it’s actually a positive thing they are trying to do?
---
The server tech isn’t crap...when wow first released this was a non-issue...there will be millions playing the first few days this is a way to make it more enjoyable for the masses...
---
in classic, it does even with layering. ultimately the populations will slowly shrink and you'll have a close knit community.
---
in retail, the only people you talk to are in your guild. battlegrounds pulled together 8 servers into a giant amalgam of players, and then the servers themselves are instanced zones.... so if you logon at 8am, and its a new shard...your shard is empty. then it slowly fills up until its full around 9am, and a new shard is spun up and the players zoning in goto that shard. 
---
i haven't seen the same player since i resubscribbed.
---
Yeah I'm sure either, but SoR was changed in the last patch so that might have changed.
---
grammar is completly irrelevant on reddit even more so when english is my 4th languages must be really sad to be a keyboard warrior like you
---
Thanks!
---
It did
---
They also said a lot of other things when WoW was older. Wrath was supposed to launch with the dance studio, Cataclysm with path of the titans, WoD had more customizable garrisons and overall just a lot of cut content show before release, but lately Blizzard has been more careful with any promises.
---
Me and a few friends are
---
logic doesn't work on toddlers throwing a tantrum
---
That's just sad. Layering needs to go. I don't care if I have to sit and struggle with 1000 other people launch day or a month in. This shit has got to go.
---
Happening everywhere. Us NA players are getting fucked, and now EU as well haha. Why can't they just release separate servers for the varying language groups.
---
I would 100% roll on an Esfand server. Even streaming he has on many occasions just outright chosen not to play with Asmond and company just because he has things he wants to test, which is what the entire Beta is for. Everyone is having fun with it, but Esfand is one of the handful of streamers who is actually doing his best to make it a better experience for the rest of us. His community is chill and friendly. He is chill and friendly and you can tell by watching him that if streaming wasn't even a thing for him he would be doing the exact same thing as what he is doing now and still enjoying the fun of it. He is the epitome of what a streamer should strive to be.
---
Yeah really, it wouldn't be news if it didn't generally improve security.
---
&gt;Don't worry its just the beta
---
Ptsd is kicking in
---
It's 2 on the stress test. 
---
Aa is my preferred name. If I can't grab that I have a backup in case, it's Ab. If that's also taken I have a third one in mind but I'm keeping it a secret.
---
There are no rules against other language in chat, or at least its never enforced
---
They are releasing so few servers, and then when phase 2 is around the corner they will announce layering will stay since there are too many players
---
I went to Orgrimmar, UC, Ironforge and Stormwind. All were pretty empty and I know there were tons of people in different layers sitting in the same area. It’s sad.
---
I don't think this subreddit is for you, bud.
---
It's a stress test, with one PvP and one PvE server, I think it's a huge over reaction to assume that there will be this heavy of sharding come launch. We're literally just guessing.
---
Stream sniping is your own fault for showing where you are on a pvp server, all steamers should get camped more then regular players because of this.
---
You should NOT go against the communty. If some1 from his followers thinks they can fuck up the server, they are wrong. The moment every1 hates their guild on the server it's over for him. People not gonna invite them to group, camp them in pvp untill they log off. His raid will never enter BRM without getting wiped by 2-3 guilds who are more experienced in classic. There are tons of ways you can get griefed. He might have a community, but going against the whole server of 10k people is a bald(heh) move. Anyway I know he speaks sarcastically, but you know it's half true. He embraces the meme.
---
Sure does. And the wife is wanting to not be bothered while leveling... she will get her wish there wont even be the same faction
---
Fresh private servers when?
---
Maybe because you’re in the old orgrimmar
---
All the top raiding guilds have always been on PvP servers.
---
I had 3 level 60s.  Orc Warrior, Undead Warrior, Tauren Warrior.
---
PvP servers are how the game is meant to be played. Not being able to attack the opposing faction doesn't feel right.
---
I remember this happening on both the original version and on private servers too, but again my memories might be clouded but I have some memories of this when entering a major city.
---
Especially remember it from my time on private servers.
---
Rusty trombone stains.
---
I feel for ya bud, at least your memories are fond ones. You could always do what I saw another redditor do and break ya collar bone for some time off haha :D
---
I too did an edit to the original fiddle for this to send to a friend lol
---
We are two weeks out. TWO WEEKS.
---
They have been writing the book on this new tech for months on end. Probably with the intention of pushing it to retail, since its a better version of phasing.
---
They have planned all along to have less servers, with more people on each server.
---
Do any of you honestly believe they are going to pull back on this with two weeks to go?
---
I wish they just wouldn't do this. I'm fine with the first few weeks being a shit show with people competing for resources.
---

Whakachangi, a beer created by Leigh Hart a comedian, radio presenter and more commonly known as the Heller's sausage guy. Its nothing special but very drinkable for ~$20 a doz. Could've been speights but....fuck that.
---
Might end up on a west coast server. Would’ve loved to play on one of the eastern ones but nope.
---
It's cute that you think Blizzard are trawling the /r/classicwow subreddit looking for feedback. But even if that was the case, [I think the 4 top posts complaining about exactly the same thing have it covered.](https://i.imgur.com/ltMSFa0.png)
---
we get it, your 30 minutes a week of playtime is obviously more important than the long term health of the game.
---
No. Obviously it doesn't work the way they want it to so that's why they are working on it.

I am in FUCKING limbo right now.

Layering seems like the correct solution to this though? It’s behaving poorly in some evidence provided by players but maybe it’s not actually as broken as it seems?
---
Where are you eating?

---
It's difficult to just play the AH and make gold on a new server when you have no capital to invest.
---
You make interesting points. If the mods delete it - its not because your point was bad. Its because you explained yourself like a condescending a-hole.
---
It's a hell of a lot more vanilla like than what we're getting.
---
His server would be fine. It's Asmond and Soda you want to avoid.
---
It was "LOL" changes the context. No need to be an asshole and laugh at a mistake in me not being up to date on the specifics such as lupos shadow dammage.
---
I may not be correct on this, but I vaguely remember reddit having a system in place that no longer messages directly linked users, if too many are in one comment. I believe the cap is 3. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable can correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Flooding the market inherently means that supply heavily outweighs demand. I don't think you understand the situation you are walking into if you believe this will be the case for a very long while (maybe ever).
---
ikr? i love to trigger them on general chat lmao, its like watching old people discover the internet
---
Hey man, I wouldn't bother anymore. Any rational discussion on topic is really no longer possible. You have one group of people who want to grief streamers and face no repercussions for it, and another group that is looking for any possible reason to dislike classic once fails to live up to their hype. I get not wanting to play with streamers, I know I don't really want to, but it's become way to rabid and emotional here.
---
I heard that Thalnos is being tagged as the BR PVP server, as a brazilian player I must ask, is that true?
---
Shut up im trying to keep my RP server clear of refugees

ha ha, Ah right, I just asked a kiwi mate what it was and they sent me some youtube links to watch that have that Leigh Hart in them.

Maybe if your attitude is that shit, don't play? I will, and I will have a blast.

no

Nordbros have great gaming etiquette, always a pleasure to play with

still impossible to pick..

So in retail is served choice essentially irrelevant?

Sweet Christmas! Thank you!

If they were picking before name reservations that wouldn't be an issue, but since most of them aren't saying anything and its tomorrow we are SOL
---
This is also why they will not enforce any of the other points either.
---
There should really be no layering whatsoever. This was the worst possible solution to a barely-problem.
---
Reminder, PvPing on a PvP realm is not against ToS.
---
I wouldn’t worry too much. There’s a lot of “sky is falling” right now. 
---
Is it in the realm of possibility that the layering causes a rough start? Yes. But when I first got WoW when it came out I had hour long queue and disconnects left and right. I would honestly take a bit of layering until the populations sort out to the shit show that was the original classic release.
---
Well obviously they would add more servers with a plan to merge servers after population drops
---
I’m so excited about this too! I usually
---
Play Overwatch but I’m finding I’m sick of feeling awful after a close loss in competitive. Looking forward to the relaxing experience of levelling!
---
They dont do BGs... They wpvp and have more rogue escorts than Caliph Scorpidsting
---
Stop copy and pasting this in every thread you sperg
---
"Long term" - phasing is out by phase 2 btw.
---
I'm taking 2 weeks off and have way more than 30m a day, although I am sure some people will have more time. Sorry for having a good career? 
---
People defending layering are seeing the greater good in people actually getting to play, so weird take by you to call me selfish on this.
---
Wowhead
---
Why do you raid? So you can punch some face in PvP
---
Turpin is EU is he not
---
At this point Soda is the only streamer I think deserves that treatment. Asmond's presence is going to be a pain just because of the horde of people that will always be around him and the world chat will become twitch chat, but Soda just straight up puts himself on a pedestal and speaks as though he should be able to camp people, but no one should be able to camp him.
---
I get it's sucks that people can literally just look him up and see where he is all times and pay him a visit when ever they feel like it, but that's a choice is is making and he is making a tuck fon of money from doing it.
---
No. Having different layers on a pvp server is what's fucking stupid.  How is it world pvp when not everyone is in the same fucking world?
---
Ok I keep seeing it, what the hell is layering?
---
Are you sure you wouldn't fit in better on an RP server?
---
Dad here, starting a casual guild with friends. We’ve got end game goals, but also interested in providing a fun spot for good people. No requirements or any of that nonsense, we know you have a life. 
---
We’re rolling on the RPPVP realm, Grobbulus, but we aren’t really into RP.  It’s really about the community and baseline quality of interaction. Our recruiting is just getting started but we’d love to have any dads (or moms!) who are looking for a good spot to hang. 
---
Guild name: Band of the Red Hand. 
---
LMK if interested, anyone!
---
That’s what I’m saying, don’t understand the hatred, everyone should just have fun mannn
---
&gt;very early months
---
So basically the entire leveling process to 60 will be layered. Fuck. WTB pservers
---
Hey I looked into this and it seemed fairly easy to fix.  
---
I made a small [addon](https://github.com/SuddenDeath/ClassicMenus) for it.. Haven't tested it much, but should work fine.
---
Not really. 
---
If you want your data secured, you do not host it elsewhere.
---
Unless you encrypt the data before hosting it there, you cannot guarantee security of data, which is proven now with these data leaks.
---
I found it to be more like 140ms ping not like the old days of 300ms and over
---
&gt; Why are you under this assumption that you should see other people in low populated areas? 
---
Because it's a fucking mmo you spastic
---
This is amazing.
---
Yeah, not much I can do to change layering so I'm just ignoring it for now. My priority is figuring out which English EU PVP server to roll on. Shazzrah has the "Spanish Coalition" but Golemagg has APES.
---
Those people aren't going to be playing past level 10 anyway, so it's not exactly sensible to cripple the entire game to cater to them.
---
Unless the streamer told his fanboys to go do it, to ruin your time.
---
As far as I can tell there is no more true fullscreen :(. Sucks I know.
---
I have news for you, spaniards are rolling on Shattrah as well.
---
Have fun
---
small indie company, get your shit together Blizzard
---
That's weird, because you sign up to it on a page called "BETA PROFILE SETTINGS", and it also says this: https://i.imgur.com/ZEiw0js.png
---
Sure does say "beta" quite a lot on that page.
---
And if you read Blizzard's ToS, it also says this about the betas you sign up for:
---
&gt; the Game being Beta Tested is a work in progress and may contain bugs which may cause loss of data and/or damage to your computer system;
---
But yeah sure, "iTs NoT A FuCkInG BeTa"
---
Serious question. Wont it be absolutely impossible to get out of starting zones? It would be like thousands/tens of thousands in starting areas since theres only a few servers right?
---
Sounds good mate! Haha Pukeko ya reckon, surely you're confusing them with Takahe, easily done.... (too soon!). I'll more than happily join ya for some shark n taters with local some sky rats for sure!
---
They don’t fucking care.
---
Why can't they just not use Real servers for this is beyond me.. Cheap fuckers, why do we even have to pay to play it if they use layers and clouds.
---
So the best way to make sure layering gets canned is for everyone to quit? got it
---
2, that's pretry much what he's saying.
---
Yeah...
---
Are you pro-kiwifruit on your pav?
---
Maybe it was confusing phrasing on my part, but my discussion of experiences was centered around private servers, as that's been the only way to actually play the game until the beta and stress tests started to occur. Those hoops of installation and set up tend to bar a certain set of the population from playing the game, and despite that the community was still very vibrant and large. I assume it will still be like that on live, given how ease of access has improved.
---
Yes! It's remarkably called "Classic WoWhead"
---
jokes aside, go to wowhead and tick the little blue box that says classic and it'll switch over
---
Interested! West coast horde here. Prefer pvp but don’t care too much about time zone.
---
This is how it was last time I played retail. Everyone in my friend group had donkeykong names, and had a reputation of ganking specific assholes on the server. We were revered on the server as the Kongs and no one fucked with us. I miss those days. (Wotlk)
---
Nice. The official stance is still "first weeks/month" up til phase 2 then. I personally don't see how this is happening whatsoever, though, with the amount of servers currently announced.
---
What's worse is that it's "free advertising", if it can be called that, for a game that doesn't need advertising.  It just shows how far game companies have drifted from the idea of simply making good games to have fun.
---
You've activated my trap card! I haven't given Blizzard money in a very long time.
---
Back in classic, almost every server had a &lt;UC Elevator Victims&gt; Guild.
---
Good luck forming a PUG group in chat lol
---
Why are people comparing cities in a game where most people playing are gonna be max level, compared with a game where no one is max level?
---
A better comparison would be looking at what the starting area looks like compared with what cities look like in pops with high numbers of max level chars.
---
And I think everyone that played during the stress test knows what that looks like.
---
Why would a level 1-40 be in stormwind? Go to stormwind right now in private servers and count how many level 1-40s there are. How many are there?
---
It seems like this was a troll post and has been removed? Are the majority of the Spaniards going shazzrah confirmed?
---
Yeah maybe shadow priest as others mentioned. You will fill up groups instantly if you already have tank and healer. And if you get another healer into the grp you just go dps!
---
After I saw how crap Twitch was I quickly switched to Minion and WoWInterface.
---
Tell that to Vanilla Orgrimmar.
---
Then why they make swedish ghettos?

Yeah I tested the servers. On central I get 16ms. On the PST I get 70-80. I really do not want to play PST but my guild seems to want to after the BR/streamers on EST news. Fucking sucks.

It isn't permanent, this is only for the first few weeks.

I plan on playing a mage and focusing on PvE content (but playing on a PvP server). Which talent spec is better for leveling and for endgame--31/0/20 or 16/0/35?

The Artifact reveal was brutal. That's literally all I remember about the game
---
Me too...on a pserver. Blizz is comedically fucking up the opportunity to end the need for pservers by showing why pservers will always be needed. Stop doing it for FREE.

Haha standard Aussie banter here but if you're wondering there is a solid list of things Australia has attempted to steal from New Zealand over the years  [https://www.theedge.co.nz/home/sponsored/primo/10-things-australia-have-tried-to-steal-from-new-zealand-and-cla.html](https://www.theedge.co.nz/home/sponsored/primo/10-things-australia-have-tried-to-steal-from-new-zealand-and-cla.html).   
---
I didn't know Lollycake was on that list and I am a big Lollycake fan!
---
But this is like... at least 50% of the reason why Vanilla WoW was magical. And now you can do it on much better hardware. So I don't want a neutered version of Vanilla WoW.

&gt; Do any of you honestly believe they are going to pull back on this with two weeks to go?
---
Yes, Ive been saying this since it was announced. The people just saying "take it out" are not providing anything other than their incessant whining.
---
When I level on my warlock I give everyone I pass Underwater Breathing so that might prompt them to give me their useful buff like AI or MOTW or wisdom. hehehe

Layering should only be on like the first 3 fucking days if that.
---
But if its layered its not real classic WoW. Classic WoW existed because it was a community.

---
Dominos for the altered toolbars, eCastingBar for the casting bar
---
who would have thought tips fans also like layering? this can't be a coincidence
---
Because its layering, not sharding. Layers are not zone-specific.
---
Stalagg east the other two are west. I get 16ms on the east (which is actually Chicago) and 70-80 to the west PST servers.
---
Can confirm it does this at stormwind gate too. Players running past lag slightly and teleport ahead as the shard kicks in.
---
This is such shit.  They could make the game work properly, and instead they choose not to and simply lie to cover it up.  Shit like this is exactly why I don't play retail.  If this stays live, my account reactivation isn't even going to last a month.
---
No, they didnt. Because layering has never been in live...
---
I've decided to level a Warlock for Classic as back in Vanilla I played a warrior tank but my classic guild has 8 warriors already! Will a Warlock pull good numbers in raids and be competitive? Last thing I want is to be bottom of the charts :P
---
Why would there be a crowd of players in a what was 2 day stress test that isn't permanent?
---
are you sure you're thinking about runescape, cause that's not a thing in runescape at all, and never has been
---
Couldn't this exact clause be used against players that try to grief the streamers in return? Couldn't a bunch of streamers that are being corpse camped into oblivion just cite this part of the TOS and /report the ganker doing the Lord's work?
---
Any and all PVP action is exempt from the harassment clause perhaps? Including endless corpse camping?
---
Journalists and influencer really need to press them hard on this issue whenever opportunity they get. There's no way layering is being removed after with phase 2 right now with this few servers announced. That's just logically impossible.
---
Or you jump spin to see if you can lock the game up.
---
I mean if you're seeing bugs please report them. 
---
Layering is a purposeful decision, bugs are not.
---
Are PST and EST servers hosted in the same place? Or will I get a better ping for joining a server in my timezone?
---
Super gear dependent, hard to level.  Aside from this get a swing timer and you can optimize your dps a little more potentially.
---
They have plenty of players to flood both pvp servers. 
---
AFAIK, spanish streamer Elxokas and his army of cocksuckers is going Golemagg Horde (estimated 10k players) while the rest (at least 30 spanish guilds from retail) is rolling on Shattrah
---
Yeah companies love using money and manpower to create a product that fails.
---
I think this is what is happening. Combined with the fact that it's a stress test and people won't be keeping their characters. Why play all weekend if it's just going to get wiped out? All of my friends played until level 3-5 and quit because it wasn't worth the time to level a character that was going away in a couple of days. They all plan to hit 60 and know it will take them a couple of months, too.
---
You can't test the layering tech if there aren't enough people online to force multiple layers.
---
If this is a major city, I'm not buying. If I don't see at least a few people on my run from xroads to thousand needles. I'm not buying. If there is only contact with 1 person in an hour of questing, I'm not buying. It's an mmo, not a singleplayer with a side of multiplayer
---
I think they are trying to avoid server mergers for as long as possible. Server mergers always look bad. It always looks like a community is dying out. We may not like the phasing tech, but it offers them an organic and quiet way to keep a server healthy in the long run.
---
It has pros and it has cons. Everyone is just caught up pretty damn hard on the cons right now.
---
What's the danger of a TM/SS raid when you can just grab an invite to a layer that has nothing going on? WPvP was important because it could really fuck with questing. That is out the window now. It trivializes the world. XX location is never really under attack because there's  or 4 versions of it that are perfectly fine and you can just go there to escape it.

The element that PvP brings, even for those who aren't explicitly PvPers, far outweights the annoyances. The vast majoriy of progress guilds will likely be on PvP servers (source: trends on private servers, world-first races from Vanilla-Wrath).

I agree mathematically it is better, based on precedent no.

I'd like to know about this as well if someone could enlighten.

Uh..
---
I couldn't give rat's backside about layering compared to the lack servers. You can live with layering, not 50k servers
---
I don’t see an issue then with only layering for the initial level rush and then either disabling it entirely or possibly maintaining it in high volume farming areas.
---
This is correct. u/loozerr doesn't have a clue about how layering actually works based on his previous comment.

Layering is not sharding, bud

Warlocks won't be beating the best Melee DPS (especially on Horde), but they definitely pull their own weight in terms of DPS. And of course Banish, Summons, Soulstones, Blood Pact, and Healthstone are all desired things Warlocks bring. They're definitely the easiest DPS class to find a raiding guild with.
---
How do they know if you are stream sniping? Or just ganking?  They don't, they decide what is what and arbitrarily use their influence to harass you and ruin your play experience.   Are you ok with that kind of person deciding your fate?   What if they want to take your camp and you fight for it and try to push them back out and kill them a few times?  Was that stream sniping?  It was if they decide it is.   That's the issue

Can't stop them from coming to the server, but the community Can cancel them in the form of ganking, harrasment, and shunning

---
I will repeat myself from another thread:
---
Imagine  being a 16 year old hopping into Classic WoW for the first time. You  have never played any iteration of WoW before. Enter a major city for  the first time. To trade with people you  have to leave my parties and  join them because you are  not in their shard. To join a pvp raid on the  city you have to do this as well. The city only has about 25 people in  it because of sharding. Feels dead. Seems like no one plays this game  even though a ton are. Heard a ton of this community stuff but fail to  see 90% of the players. Also when I go in and out of zones (which is how  it currently is in the stress test) you see players, mobs, and NPCs  fade in and out. People are abusing layering to get loot.
---
Basically layering even for a few weeks (which is when people are trying out the game) will kill the sense of community.
---
Its not a minor inconvenience. Its literally what made WoW what it was. Why even play it if it isn't to restore the community aspect? Like... just go play regular WoW and turn your graphics down.
---
You rejected what you got so play the other.
---
Sacrifice the integrity for its lifetime?
---
You do realize layering is gone by p2 right?
---
So not only are you extremely rude for no fucking reason but your ignorant as guck too. Grow up
---
Didn't Blizz say that they will remove layering on release and it's only there on test
---
Separate pvp stats on items were a sad day for us all.
---
sorry?
---
Gee whiz I'm glad you're here with your crystal ball to tell us what's going to happen.
---
What's honestly shocking is there are still rubes who believe this. That there will be some mystical last second change within the last two weeks post-beta in the very final stress test that will change and fix everything. That is not how development works. Entering Beta you are seeing 99% of the final product for any software. Exiting beta into stress testing *you are seeing the final product.*
---
Christ I've been reading this exact same post, near word for word, every single WoW expac since 2007. At this point there's not even a point in arguing about it. I already know what's going to happen. Launch will come and it will be exactly like this. You'll insist it's just for phase 1. Phase 2 will come and it's still there. You'll insist this is a good thing because it means the game is so popular. You will be utterly incapable of admitting Blizzard misled you no matter how bad it gets, and when people inevitably leave in droves, you'll insist it's because they're bitching and moaning crying children who just can't appreciate Blizzard's hard work. Did I miss anything there?
---
50% Spanish is better than 100% Spanish
---
Ah I thought "east coast" actually meant east coast.
---
Layering is necessary so people like you don’t come on reddit and squeal about how you can’t login and play the game...come release
---
PST should be LA and EST should be Chicago. Blizzard is kind of dumb and on retail they allowed PST servers to be hosted in Chicago and vice versa, but I doubt they do that this time.
---
This article is pretty disingenuous. Nobody sits around in major cities on a test realm, on the first day every spawn in the starting zones had multiple people camping it, even with layering. Every single time I've run through Goldshire there are tons of people, some guy getting into a lower population layer for a bit isn't really a good measure. 
---
I just hope that they don't keep it for longer than a day or two on the real server.
---
To RP or not to RP... There's the question
---
While on the east coast I first rolled on an ocean server... by accident. Didn't have any lag
---
This is great! I was hoping for a guild/group that had similar time restrictions as I do. Working 50-60 hours most weeks with a 6 month old and a dog.. I can only play 1-2 hours most days. I would love to join up
---
Also I support the name “dad bods”
---
Procs help but it isn't reliant on them. SoR was also changed last patch so it may very well proc stuff now (not that I'm expecting it to) since the seal was really buggy just in general. The whole idea needs a lot of testing in general because paladins are the most broken class on pservers and a lot of items are wrong. Claiming to know whether or not it is competitive when a \*lot\* of data is simply unknown at this point is... foolish.
---
Should have asked for an invite... your still correct though
---
I see people suggesting to use [Camera Following Style]: Never. But it just seems really odd to me never have done it. Is there an actual benefit?
---
Totally agree. I'm leaving with layering. We want real classic
---
It's only going to be in for a few weeks, and it'll balance out the numbers of people in areas assuming the bugs are fixed. This isn't going to change anything about how you play if it functions properly.
---
&gt;If a streamer rolls on your server, and enough people report him, he will be temp banned 24 hours or until review
---
&gt;So if you see a streamer, right click his name plate and report!
---
there's a bit of a double standard going on here at the moment. Everyone is foaming at the mouth about streamers ruining their classic experience. Yet you're advocating ruining their experience. What you're suggesting probably goes against reddit and blizzard rules.
---
Plenty of people including myself have created examples used from other MMOs to look at for potential solutions.
---
Don’t lie to push your narrative, even though this is Reddit.
---
This thread is about as legitimate of criticism as you can get, Redditors are also not paid six figures to be game developers but we can provide consumer feedback on the product we are planning to pay for.
---
- Laering in Phase 1 **so long as it is needed**
---
- No layering in Phase 2
---
- No layering in Phase 3
---
- No layering in Phase 4
---
- No layering in Phase 5
---
- No layering in Phase 6

Okay. When it was called sharding and they added it to live, did they not say it was temporary? As they are now?
---
I think you could even recreate this in ElvUi but that is technical af.
---
This. It trivializes the world, which is the most important aspect of Vanilla. Why do WPvP raids matter when you can just grab an invite into a layer where nothing is going on. Getting camped by higher level character? grab an invite to a different layer. Poof. Threat gone.
---
There's no way that's happening with this amount of servers unless you want everlasting cues.
---
If I had to put my tinfoil hat on, something tells me they're experimenting with their layer / sharding Frankenstein for Phase 2.
---
They promised one world boss and no layering, they didn't promise there wouldn't be yet again a new technicality "not sharding" initiative. 
---
There's so few servers it's honestly impossible to get rid of layering, and for there only to be one world boss, the zone it lives in will needed to be sharded if "layering" still exists.

I get remarkably angry at any priest who doesn't fort my rogue/warrior
---
Thank you for the tip I'll have to try it.
---
How is that guy not on the avoidstreamers list yet then if people know about him?
---
Within healer classes priest is the best probably. Once you go into shadow talent tree you get a talent where you can increase shadow dmg taken by the enemy which pairs well with lock dmg.
---
Is this permanent?
---
Really the only one is questie.
---
Yes, that happened and you are correct about that, but it seems that somehow a lot of people still dont understand layering at all and it doesn't help if you go around saying the word "layering" when you really mean "sharding".
---
Honestly after leveling a Warrior on a private server I was shocked at how easy it was.
---
&gt; That is not how development works.
---
I'm literally a software engineering team lead (my team is 12 developers and 2 QAs) and I guarantee you that's how software releases pan out sometimes. A mad rush towards the end of a deadline is extremely common. If it's a trivial fix (could be as simple as changing the parameters which trigger a switch in layers) it won't be high priority, and can be done close to launch. This layering bug could have been off anybody's radar until the stress test, and they could even have it fixed already.
---
&gt;  At this point there's not even a point in arguing about it. I already know what's going to happen.
---
Ok, then let's not bother arguing and we'll see.
---
&gt;Lock is the easiest to duel -lvl with
---
Dual level. If you level by dueling it'll take you forever.
---
Actually heading to New Zeland for a mates 30th Snowboarding trip, return early monring of Classic release so solid timing :P (+the remining week off for Grind.
---
Whoever is the priest needs to remember: Power World Shield screws with rage generation.
---
So.. they think most people will leave so they implement a design that is exactly contrary to the spirit of Vanilla WoW to ensure they leave. Genius! Can't be wrong.
---
Right. (งツ)ว
---
When I select by patch it just reverts back to searching the entire database when I search for a specific named addon
---
Um
---
Great thanks :)
---
elvui
---
I took some vacay a week or two after launch. Best case the game is amazing and I can no life it out. Worst case I can go innawoods and camp out for a week and turn my brain off for a bit. I'm delaying my resub for sure because I saw this mess coming a mile away.
---
It takes a functioning brain to understand when people are being sarcastic or putting on an act. The only train of thought you’ll find here is stream man bad.
---
When they did tests without layering the game was basically unplayable, I know because I was there on the stress test and there are million of streamers/youtubers to prove how shitty the performance of the servers was.
---
Regardless, even if they turn off layering for phase 2 if the servers act in a way such as that then the game will be utterly unplayable. 
---
“Blizzard could open more servers” 
---
Yes they could, but you won’t have two weeks to reserve your name on them and by then the hype will have fizzled out to the point where nobody will want to re-roll and hardcore classic fans will go back to the next private server to pop up using the Classic client.
---
Zing!  Same here.
---
Just to be sure, you should create a macro that starts with this, then follow it with /cast Sinister Strike or whatever you use most.
---
Anyone rolling on a streamer server for anything other than twitch memes is ruining their own experience. "Oh I want to be standing at the streamer duel tourney that happens once!"
---
What're you talking about?  I logged in to the stress test and the first thing I did was run straight to Ironforge to dance naked on the mailbox and hand out free enchants...
---
What realm are the streamers on? Trying to avoid
---
Mind if I PM you about some info on the Guild??
---
or change it in your [config.wtf](https://config.wtf) file like the top post said and do it once ever
---
Hey, I am pretty drunk, its the bet wording I could come up with! lol
---
They misquoted, it's supposed to be 3k per layer. But yeah
---
They have a financial incentive to reduce or remove layering... It's costing them hardware, power, etc to keep the layering on.  If they can run classic and bfa on the same server hardware, they should have the ability to slide servers from one area to another.  If that's the case they can flip flop servers from one classic to live and back again for various content releases.
---
Can you change subreddit names? Maybe keep the second one and make it for just horde/alliance? As a horde player, I support the enemy but I don’t want their posts clogging my feed ya know?
---
They could just cook up instanced starter zones for each race real fast, too. It wouldn't be exactly the same but it would be better than layering the whole server.
---
I honestly think there are a bunch of people whose favorite thing about WoW is complaining about it
---
What, streamer servers are pretty bad in retail too, except retail has a ton of crz shit to fix it
---
When reserving a name, can I just ignore character customization to take the name as fast as possible? Then delete the character and remake at a later date?
---
Im not OP. I wasn't demanding answers from you but these are things Blizzard needs to consider and communicate. They haven't at all communicated about it so it's not a ridiculous assumption to make that they haven't considered it thoroughly enough either.
---
There's also no reasonable way to shove 20k players on Asmongold's server with no CRZ. This is the problem. There simply arent enough servers to handle demand.
---
Its enjoyment by causing them grief
---
I've never looked at your post history you're literally paranoid. You can play the game on launch day you just might not be able to quest or level as efficiently as you would be able to if it was empty. You can condense populations through things like server merges if needed rather than layering without any of the draw backs.  
---
  
---
The majority are apathetic, if you look at any wow community hub or fan site everyone seems to hate it, reddit, official forums, fan forums, random image boards. Not sure where you're getting this majority from.  
---
Who mentioned instanced monster drops? I mentioned vendor recipes where they still a limited amount of the item.
---
Correct
---
Its in the interview they did.
---
The fact that they want to leave this in until phase 2 or whatever is the most retarded thing I've ever heard.
---
PHASE 1 IS THE ONE WHERE IT MATTERS THE MOST.
---
Fuck off with this shit.
---
Then its after getting geared in MC. The gnomes int was discussed in good depth in another thread.
---
&gt; Don’t lie to push your narrative
---
???????????????????????
---
You're crazy. There are people who give legit criticism and have been fostering ideas, but there are way more comments with "just take it out" which isn't helpful, its just venting. That's all I'm saying. This thread has barely anything of value. The article is great.
---
Its not considered one by blizz. On their earnings call they barely mentioned it. 8.2 was talked about a ton more than classic
---
I’m looking for exactly what you are. What are the two servers we have to choose from? I’ve missed a lot of the “drama” over the weekend.
---
This is the most delusional post in this thread so far. :)
---
People are fucking strange. Especially kids on twitch.
---
LAWN CARE. OR. RIOT.
---
What is your source on the purpose of the stress test being to put as many people into one area as possible, as opposed to, I dunno, seeing how the servers handle running a ludicrous number of layers like one would expect from a test where the layering thesis is set very low?
---
Well since I'm already banned by association, there's not much point to disassociate from them is there? Not like doing so would get me unbanned.
---
Ok you might get some chill small-mid sized streamers like monkeynews
---
But none of this hyperactive streamer zaibatsu shit where 5+ streamers (asmon + classicast + soda gang) and their combined 50k+ viewers congregate on the same server
---
I understand the difference between the two. On retail, they used open-world instancing to bring more people into the same area. Here, they use open-world instancing to do the opposite. The shitty experience is the same, the mechanics are the same.
---
I don't think people calling them the same thing is going to create much chaos.
---
Because it's classic
---
Yea you can, here's a [blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/reserve-your-name-in-wow-classic-on-august-12-at-3-00-p-m-pdt/242723/141).
---
Totally agree with you. One can think that in this time and age the technology  have improved.
---
Guys??? Why are you all getting so bummed out by this?? It’s a STRESS TEST. They are purposely stressing their mechanics out to TEST them and get them ready for FINAL RELEASE...?????
---
Isn't this basically the same thing as add-ons in retail that let you server hop, expressly for the purpose of checking to see if a rare spawn is present in that server shard or later or whatever? I skipped every expansion from BC to Panda and that add-on was helpful in catching up a ton of stuff I'd just missed by virtue of not playing. 
---
Sometimes you could even spot other people doing the same thing, like two universe travelers on similar hunts for an uncamped spawn at the right time. Sometimes you'd both just duel for the tag, maybe run around in circles casting AoE just in case. 
---
IIRC they changed things in BFA so that the add-ons wouldn't work as well as they used to and forced people into using goofy number code workarounds.
---
Yeah but if enough people comment voicing there displeasure and saying how they won’t resub for this garbage it *will* have impact because that effects Blizzards bottom line which is what matters most here.
---
Which interview?
---
They have only counter suspended 1 guy ever.  Counter banning only works if they an pin point that it was malicious.  There is one guy who got nailed as a 40 man boxer because he was doing it to everyone who attacked him and wiped him. 
---
It is pretty much 100% safe and lets say they did do anything, which they won't, it would be a warning at best.
---
&gt; It was an issue that lasted until Wrath.
---
Because this is when crossrealm became a thing, and WoW was at its peak playerbase, and server merges happened. But yeah I get you. The problem was too many servers from the get go, and they couldn't really go back on that. Not really their fault, a game like this hadn't been done before and who could how known what the perfect amount of servers was?
---
Most people playing the game don't come to reddit or read twitter. Lots and lots of people will unwittingly roll on the streamer server.
---
This sub is ruining the excitement of launch for me. Nothing but bitching and whining. Constant comments about the big bad stream man and how the game is destined to fail and we can’t wait to get back to private servers. It’s becoming a chore to find positive discussion here.
---
Big disagree on that one, especially if you play on Horde. 
---
The biggest leveling chokepoint is the barrens. 
---
I believe it should exist in 1-20 areas, and nowhere beyond that.
---
When they change it to one class and spec can participate more, another will be participating less
---
Just put it in my edit then mate
---
The current overall is 52:48 Horde. So hopefully queues won't be a big problem either way.
---
Let's roll Horde and call the guild "Dad Bod"
---
I'm down to join. Want to come to Thalnos?
---
Nah, would totally ruin the game
---
Was it aloud during the stress test? I was working on both a horde and alliance on the rp pvp server this weekend.
---
retail bad
---
I'm not agree. I have played in privates with an average of 11k on and it was awesome
---
wait rly?
---
yeaaahhh afking at cruising altitude on a  flying mount while in a dungeon finder queue is way more fun than hanging out with the community in IF...
---
Why would EST be in Chicago and not have a CST time zone?
---
Stuff like this is caused because they can't tell us where they are going.  All of us,and I mean ALL OF US, are more than happy to start on a different server.  They refuse to tell us what server they are going to so they can reserve their name, and fuck everyone else who picked wrong that day.  That is the problem here.  So it is tit for tat, because they are being selfish.
---
Im doing skinning and leatherworking but once I get through making the devilsaur sets and have some decent gold I will swap over to engineering.
---
Honestly, this looks like a skip for me. I was there for vanilla beta and the vanlila launch. That's the experience I wanted. This ain't it and FF14 is holding my interest just fine.
---
come on now, you really don't have to be like that. spastics are not that dumb.
---
Well right now you also switch instances - for example, you can be in one shard in Durotar and see people outside of Ogir dueling and such, walk into Ogir for about ten steps and turn around and walk out and everyone is gone because you switched shards.
---
Every true raider is going on a pvp server.
---
&gt; it wasn't in vanilla, it wasn't on private servers, fucking remove that shit.
---
Vanilla and p servers didnt have 50,000+ players per server on launch.
---
Have you been reading this thread? Half of the comments demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of layering. We've known about layering for 10 months now and we're 2 weeks from launch yet it seems most people still don't understand how layering works.
---
Let's hope something happens
---
The point is that they *can* ban them easily with a valid reason, they just don't *have* to
---
What's the difference between a Eastern and a Pacific American server? Does it just affect the time on the in-game clock? Would it affect my ping if I chose a Pacific server while living on the east coast?
---
Imagine actually believing a nebulous timeframe
---
Wishful thinking that your vocal minority is really going to affect much. This train isn't stopping for you.
---
Yeees following along as she did that was mindblowing.
---
You mean the train that created the hype for these servers? Alrighty then.
---
What rules?  Name me one place that says you can not report someone for cheating.  It is a function in the game for anyone to use.  We are just following the guide lines and rule sets in the game, same as their idiot followers who will clear zones and screw people out of farms because the streamer wants to stroke his ego that day.  Technically it is completely legit.
---
They can just remove layering in the aggro radius of world bosses.
---
IT'S LAYERING!!! REEEEEEEE
---
no :)
---
Well that's completely wrong.  PVP is a legit part of the game. A gaggle of fucktardians purposely killing mobs you need with no way to stop them is entirely different.
---
&gt;You've mentioned many things, that would require a several times longer message to reply, since you've blatanly ignored the main and key point of the conversation: gender dysphoria is a dysphoria.
---
That's not the key point. The key point is your weird favoritism that everyone else doesn't share.
---
&gt;While you admit you are uninformed about transgender people and their issue, 
---
I never said I was uninformed.
---
&gt;you deny this is a problem while partaking in a conversation about transgender people and their issues, 
---
This isn't a debate about transgender issues. You're just trying to make it one because you're obsessed with transgender issues. 
---
&gt;and claim for the second time that I'm obsessed with something without saying how and why. 
---
Read above.
---
&gt;In fact, one could argue that you are the one obsessed given you've specifically came to say all this stuff to me out of the blue just for mentioning I disliked an image, it sincerely looks like you came just wanting to argue for the sake of arguing, knowing beforehand you'd disagree with anything I could say.
---
You're mad because I criticized a bad opinion on the internet?
---
&gt;Not to mention this  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;and putting trans people on a pedestal  
---
&gt;You have just told me that aknowledging the problems a group faces is putting them on a pedestal.
---
Nope. Sure didn't. You can re-read what I *actually* said though, when you're feeling honest. 
---
&gt; Just imagine for a second thinking that someone who says "calling black people the N-word is bad" is putting black people on a pedestal. Just stop for a second and think over what you said.
---
Once again, you're completely missing the point. 
---
If someone stabs someone to death and calls them the N-word, it's weird to be traumatized by the fact that they said the N-word, over the fact that they just stabbed someone to death.
---
&gt;Then how you mentioned transgender people not being slaves, like if you were implying that would somehow reduce the importance of a slur used against them,
---
It does.
---
&gt; since I've never said the T-word has the same weight as the N-word, just that they are equivalents (disgusting slurs used against a specific demography).
---
Ok.
---
&gt; Not to mention that transgender people, just like black people and homosexuals, have received active discrimination and targeted crime across history and even today in many places.
---
&gt; There are gay concentration camps Chechnya, specific anti-transgender policies and bills in western countries, deaths-quads in Brazil murdering transgender and homosexual people, etc.
---
If only Blizzard banned Angwe... This might have been prevented!
---
&gt;So mentioning blacks being slaves and denying this circumtance for transgender people does not only miss the point
---
No, it's pretty on point. I made it clear that the N-word is worse. We can agree to disagree if you'd like.
---
&gt; (transgender person facing transphobia in this particular case) but it is a completely pointless and irrelevant thing to point out since this is not a competition about who faces the worse discrimination.
---
Ok?
---
&gt;You then said that regulating the usage of slurs is authoritarian... 
---
Yes. Telling people what they can and cannot say is authoritarian, no matter what the word is.
---
&gt;And even claimed that I hold any privilege whatsoever for being LGBT member, 
---
Sorry if facts bother you.
---
&gt;not only when anyone can report that message
---
For politics, yes.
---
&gt; (I haven't, definitely), but when LGBT is exclusively comprised of minorities that have faced and face discrimination or are looked down in the whole world.
---
I don't believe the whole world is looking down on LGBT people one bit, because I'm not a fear-mongering victimized partisan hack. It's just the shitholes that actively discriminate against LGBT people. Come to Canada  : ) We have equal rights here.
---
&gt; It is quite ironic that while in the real world people are being namecalled, murdered and beaten for their sexuality, you claim there's any privilege to be part of it.
---
Literally every demographic has been a victim of namecalling and violence. That doesn't mean some individuals aren't privileged. 
---
&gt;And call the usage of slurs "disagreeing". Using a slur is not disagreeing.
---
Yes it is. It's an automatic disagreement about whether slurs should be acceptable or not.
---
&gt; Disagreeing is saying you don't like a painting, or certain color, or that you prefer beans with a specific ingredient. Using the T-word is just disrespecting someone.
---
Saying you wish someone was dead is even more disrespectful.
---
&gt;There's absolutely nothing political about transgender people 
---
&gt;and their issues
---
Depends on the issues.
---
&gt; This is a basic human rights issue,
---
It's not a human right to never see a transgender slur on the internet 😂 Oh my god, hahahah
---
&gt;In fact, the ones claiming it is political are the ones who usually pander against it for political purposes (for example, using misinformation and ignorance to create an imaginary enemy, like with the american bathroom bills).
---
Okay buddy, whatever you wanna believe.
---
&gt;Literally every screenshot contained rude and 'harmful' language  
---
&gt;And, again, you are talking about the other content like I have the obligation to talk about it,
---
You don't. But I don't have an obligation to not criticize you.
---
&gt; or that I should talk about what YOU prefer, 
---
Oh god, you wouldn't be able to handle what I'd prefer 😂
---
&gt;instead of about what I simply want.
---
You never said anything you want. You just said a victim of cyber-bullying "seemed like a piece of shit", and you're being criticized for it.
---
&gt; You seem to be obsessed with wanting other people having the same preferences and concerns as you.
---
Hell no. I enjoy laughing at bad opinions.
---
&gt;That's transphobic. Not all trans people are vulnerable. What a Republican thing to say.  
---
&gt;Ignoring the unrelated video about homophobia in the military, 
---
It's related if you can understand the thought process.
---
&gt;this just seems like you are mocking a serious issue. I could post a thousand of data showing how vulnerable transgender people are.
---
A whole thousand?
---
&gt;The absurdly high homelessness percentage.The number of transgender youth being disowned and thrown to the streets by their parents for coming out.The weak economical situation in some countries, like the US, due to a combination of what I said previously and the high costs of HRT treatment.The far higher risk of being murdered, beated or raped...
---
Wow. Very relevant. So on topic. I'm now totally convinced that Angwe is a piece of shit because Transgender people have a high homeless rate.
---
I'm all ready with my undead warlock.
---
I don't think people have really thought this through, or haven't played on P server launches. 
---
Imagine competing with 3000 people to try and tag a *single* mob, not for a quest, no. But just to grind exp because everything else is swamped. 
---
Now imagine 10,000 people, in each starter zone, competing for those same resources. 
---
It's just not realistic.
---
Warlock is good with any class, really. Priest is probably easier, as both classes are super mana efficient.
---
Warlock &amp; Mage is good if you aren't concerned about having a healer. You have double CC with Succ and Sheep - and things die so fast even the mage won't run out of mana.
---
Warlock and Druid is solid, but the Druid has a lot more burden than, say, a priest would. Priests can just dot/flay/wand and throw the occasional heal. Druids will need to play a mixed role - and thorns/MoW aren't as good as fort (imo).
---
Why am I wrong then?
---
Wait, so you actually think every single job has the same requirements for the way you act? You actually have to be trolling.
---
this is something blizzard needs to find a solution around.  you obviously wouldn't want to ban streamers for doing their thing but you obviously have to acknowledge the impact they have on a game that wasn't designed to have thousands of people feeding one player in a coordinated way.  the chat system alone becomes twitch chat as soon as they start streaming in mass.
---
I thought they merely said that it would never be in Pandaria while Pandaria was current? I don't think they ever stated that it would "never happen in any current expansion's content"
---
&gt;"Well I'm gay, and people call me the F-word all the time, both friends and enemies, and it's never bothered me"  
---
&gt;This is basically "I never did this so no one should". Your whole point seem to revolve around this; people doing what you expect and want them to do. Since you don't get offended, no one should.
---
If you get offended by mean words on the internet, you lose my respect. It's as simple as that.
---
&gt; or their banning from the military. 
---
You seriously think it's acceptable for transgender people to fight on the frontlines and serve a military that directly supports a capitalist white supremacy patriarchy?
---
A druid and warlock have no down time between heals, lifetap, and shifting to feral forms to regen mana. With void walker, fear, kiting, and bear tank you can pull a ridiculous amount of mobs constantly with warlock dots ticking away which pair well with moonfire and insect swarm. Warlock and druid aren't in competition for gear upgrades like warlock and priest would be. 
---
It's a good combo.
---
Have a link?
---
no no no this is the internet we are in cancel culture now so anything we dont like has to get tossed or we riot
---
Dude what an epic response! Thank you so much. I hope others find this.
---
Sounds like you're destined for warrior.  
---
Sometimes you choose a class, other times the class chooses you. I mained an undead warlock back in the day, and I'm going to play one yet again.
---
And its only temporary, as well.
---
Do I need to have the game installed in order to reserve names tomorrow? Or can they be reserved any other way?
---
Yeah, they do. They're not going to though. People will complain all the way up until it's removed.
---
Problem is a lot of addons listed are broken or very incomplete.
---
You can't tell if they are most of the time unless you personally try them out.
---
Addon devs need more time.
---
Think twice. Spaniard streamer joining Golemagg
---
My bad I never looked at username.
---
Honestly I disagree. I assume blizzard has a team that thinks about and discusses these things. 
---
Game companies usually say as little as possible, until needed from my experience and this is something I have seen discussed here on reddit, but because of this I dont see them openly discussing the inner workings of every thing they do with the public. 
---
Obviously this is just my thoughts and I have nothing to back anything up. And I never actually intended on expressing my thoughts in this sub as I haven't thought enough on the subject to have a valid opinion,  I just got high and I didnt like ppl acting like they knew things for sure when they can't, and I picked that comment t to attack as it was the one that got me eventually... so there you go reddit... the ramblings of a stoner waiting for classic to drop. Cheers
---
Locks don't get Spell hit from talents, and phase 1 only has 4 cloth items with hit, 2 before mc, teir 1 lock chest, and a mage set piece. So you'll miss a good deal until getting geared in BWL.
---
I don't watch his stream but this seems like a clear joke as if he knew it was going to get clipped and posted on Reddit. Though what he's saying is somewhat true lol
---
As someone who hasn't played wow in years I'm not defending blizzard at all, I'm stating facts, This is a stress test, not live. I'm just saying that given the parameters blizzard have set, I wouldn't expect many players to even enter cities let alone afk in cities like you will see on live and on private servers.
---
It looks like classic except not like shit
---
It's temporary to make the launch smoother. They stated it will he removed in a later phase
---
No. Stop trying to create a "perfect" experience. Go play retail if you want that. Massive pop and bit of chaos is actually fun. Remember fun guys?
---
ZG is phase 4
---
Ahh yes name calling, the pinnacle of creative criticism.
---
These are the kind of excellent pranks that can only be possible during vanilla. That troll you killed probably laughed so hard he peed himself
---
I left a comment on it. Wish they were asking for more types of information but this is a good start at least.
---
Leave classic as is. You have seen what they do when they change things
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/coy0w3/i_understand_the_purpose_of_layering_in_the_open/
---
If wow classic is DOA at least people will get to datamine it and make better pservers with 7-10k population.
---
Is it because everyone is killing everything so you can’t complete quest objectives or is it because the system can handle it?
---
Hm?
---
Let’s start with an extreme example. 100k players are on a server gathering resources at a rate about 30x what a max capacity server would. Granted these resources are in equilibrium with the playerbase so everything is ‘fine’ for now. As that playerbase goes back down towards the planned 3k mark people will either sell at a discounted rate or hand their resources to other players (to some degree). Eventually you get the projected 3k population with 100k worth of resources? (obviously not as extreme as this in reality).
---
People will most likely end up vendoring the majority of the resources because they are nearly worthless until now the 3k population has 100k people worth of vendor gold. Now the economy is royally screwed?
---
Why are you rolling a healer on a pvp server if you want to run solo and hate pvp? You are going about this all wrong for what it sounds like you want.
---
Regardless, he said before name res

First of all let me complement you on responding to a post  this old. Secondly if I recall correctly, I already talked about Perplexity 2 in which he has a duel session with one of the best vanilla mages around.  
---
And the mage is elemental in most duels. If he was frost it would be even more onesided.
---
But hey, I'm sure you'll tell me how Perplexity is actually a bad rogue or something. Go on, state your case.

Remember that this is Classic (aka Vanilla). If you didn’t see a mass of horde players in IF messing around near the tram or on their way to kill Magni, the horde on your server were doing it wrong. (/s for that last bit)
---
There is a very easy solution to there not being enough servers to handle demand and I find it hilarious that so many people like you don't see the forest for the trees.
---
We used to have plenty of South East Asian players, they started raids a few hours later which I found cool because I actually wanted to raid later and there were no issues. 
---
Really the only people who should have an issue is the people having to play on a realm that's not in their region but then again people are bitches and just want to bitch.
---
Add more servers and then merge them if the fall of is as horrific (SURPRISE: It won't be) as they think. Easy.
---
Thanks so it was misquoted
---
Sure, but there are still a couple of problems with this. Let's say you've already used up your 3 reservation slots on some highly sought after names, but decided you want to play on a newly announced server instead. Also, for the sake of the argument, let's assume you *really* cared about your character names.
---
If the realms go live immediately with the announcement, you'll lose your chance of getting the names right then. Unless you happen to be really lucky and are browsing the Blizzard forums or New on this subreddit at that very moment. Even then, you'll still have to delete your old characters before being able to reserve new ones, and quick.
---
If the launch of said servers is announced ahead of time, (more logical) you'll have to delete your existing chars beforehand and gamble on the chance that you'll actually get the names you want on the new server. If you're too slow and can't get the names, you'd have to go back to the old one and re-create your characters. And hope that no one is camping the server release, hoping for people to delete their chars on the existing servers to join the new ones. This is unrealistic, but *could* happen. And then you'd be out of your names on two servers.
---
Everything else aside, the idea of having to contend for names you've already secured sucks.
---
people watch streamers for the streamers, not to watch the game
---
I'm glad about that. Our entire population is still about 15,000,000 fewer than the population of the state of California. I don't want it split over 5-10 realms.
---
you gotta take off your gear for those long deathruns
---
Minion sucks aswell, I got it a few days ago and it keeps trying to install older versions on my Retail game, and it takes *8 minutes to start up*. However, I still think it is the best option for Classic addons, and so i'm using it for that and Twitch for Retail
---
Fuck layering. 
---
They want launch to be smoother? Fuck it, I don't. Let me get frustrated logging in and getting a queue. Let me struggle finding a boar to kill. Let single quests take hours to complete. Let me be forced to group up with others. Let me play the World of fucking Warcraft.
---
Immersion comes with headaches and is messy, but that's what makes it what it is; a seemless, clean, soulless leveling experience cannot be immersive by any stretch of the imagination
---
Asmongold has done shit to intentionally disrupt gameplay of others yet he has never been banned. I don't think this applies to streamers unless they MAJORLY fuck up.
---
I never played classic but mained an elemental shaman (Alliance) since they were available. Is shaman DPS really not viable in Classic?
---
Every class is not just viable but strong in endgame PvP and PvE. There is no need for any balance changes.
---
Which is why they should either be banned outright, or at best quarantined to a single server.  If they were all forced into a single server that people would be able to avoid, there would no longer be a problem.
---
This post makes me hate being Australian.
---
&gt; There's no way that's happening with this amount of servers, unless you want everlasting cues.
---
Sauce?
---
Did layering happen in old WOW? I remember all home bases being packed back in the day. People dancing and hopping all over the place. Loved it
---
lmao yea that'll happen
---
Embrace the one true god Grobbulus into your life.
---
A reasonable human being who isn’t putting their life into the quality of server population of a 15 year old MMO...
---
*Fuck you buddy*
---
In all seriousness, I agree.  Blizzards main goal is to retain subscriptions.  They won’t allow layering to *destroy* the game in the first few weeks.
---
I honestly believe layering will be a welcome and needed feature for the first few weeks.  I want to play 2-3 hours after work, and if I have to stand around waiting 1 hour with 100 other player to kill Huffer...imma be pissed.
---
+1 to reasonable contrarian opinion
---

---
You can buy classic game time with retail gold.
---
&gt;she
---
:thinking:
---
WoWInterface is what i'm using, they do have a launcher called Minion that DOES work for Classic addons, its a really bad app, but considering *it actually works* thats good enough for me
---
How are they going to avoid that, though? The only way I can see this happening is if they don't stream the launch. But they're going to be drowning in fans regardless at some point. I don't agree that the reasoning you gave is their primary motivation for not announcing their servers.
---
&gt; This article is pretty disingenuous. Nobody sits around in major cities on a test realm,
---
The starting zones were absolutely packed and I was competing with 5 people for every quest item.
---
I went to IF and it was empty, but why would people be hanging out on the IF bridge during a stress test?  I only stopped by to make sure my auction add-on was working then logged out.  Absolutely no point in afking in a major city during a stress test.
---
I feel like this is comparing apples to oranges when you look at a picture of nostalrius closing and a level 15 max stress test.
---
I think it will.  flooding blizzard with complaints will encourage them to think of a long term solution rather than let the polarization of streamer fans vs community destroy the experience for everyone
---
Honestly I disagree. They should be allowed on whatever server they want. They need to be treated like everyone else. That's the solution to this. No special goddamn treatment. And when that means people countergank them and dogpile on them relentlessly, sorry bud, that's that.
---
What a good response. They can easily set certain zones/scenes to use sharding (which layering is) and others not. They can just make a scene for each world boss and turn off layering. When people go there they will all be put on the same "layer"
---
Somebody explain to me how killing a player that is broadcasting their location is frowned upon. If you're making yourself known on a damn pvp server how is thst not on you?
---
Realm situation bad
---
there's only 100 comments on this thread. You're kidding yourself. Vocal. Minority.
---
You guys all have phones, right?
---
Welp, you clearly don't want to have a civil or sensible discussion, and already used words such as "mad" or "bad opinion" while laughing, using emojis and blatanly ignoring (ok.) context and points given, resorting to the same cyclical dodging of issues.
---
Just have a good day.
---
Yeah it’s definitely not quoted as this stress test though has the same settings. It’s an assumption that people are making.
---
So true, especially now in classic. It really feels like you are rooting out the scourge while defending your people from the scarlet crusade.
---
You know what, You're right, I just went to Blackrock Mountain and it's empty, normally on private servers or back in vanilla it would be packed here with people pvping and waiting to enter MC. /s
---
As I said in my first post, YES layering has problems.
---
People like you are the reason we have BfA today lol.. Keep saying that to yourself and when the game releases I can guarantee that you're gonna be the first one whining on here since this will definitely ruin the immersion in the game.
---
Yea that must be why it failed
---
Sometimes there aren't perfect solutions. It's better for them to start with the minimum number of servers to see how they fill up then open more as needed before launch.
---
Same here. Im going RP server to make sure no otherpaisano follows
---
Death by campfire...... that's a new one lol
---
I totally forgot Dalaran was on the ground in a bubble D:

I might be open to that but I don’t yet see why that would be necessary or useful.

Comparing alpha/beta experiences to a stress tests that is literally designed around fiddling with layering is a total false equivalence.

lol what? are you telling me i want layering? hilarious

Oceanic servers have always had a large population of Singaporeans. More the merrier I say, they speak English and are really good at the game.

Yes it affect your ping dont know how much. I'm in Texas and anyways have played on eastern servers. I saw somewhere that the eastern servers are in Chicago anyway.
---
aw man im so jealous of those 13 trillion subs playing a dumb ass mobile casino slot machine simulator i feel so dumb for liking actual video games and being a minority! im so dumb and lame and not cool
---
I can't decide either. Torn between the same. For me it's Pagle or Bloodsail. Grob isn't out of the question either. 
---
The population of Bloodsail concerns me, and the % of people who will want to raid does, too. At least on Grob or Pagle I know I'll get groups easily...
---
Then again, I think Bloodsail will be all right if it stays the only RP server. So... Hm.

Perfectly Balanced.
---
If you are going Horde, consider Enhancement Shaman. Ignore all the leveling guides as they are for people solo leveling. With a warrior, base your play style more on instance tactics. You’d have totems, healing wave to reduce downtime, and can blast with lightning or help the warrior melee depending on mood.
---
Is the stresstest not through the beta client?
---
been up since thursday. end tomorrow. just for testing purposes.
---
It’s okay, you’ll last a few hours in classic anyway...not sure why you can about layering anyway...
---
This dude is aswome he did it with all the classes almost he is making  the best routes now for every class
---
They've been egregiously avoiding server merges for the entire life of the game. The closest we got was connected realms.
---
Ok then can you explain at all how it's different? Also if you feel free to read back I explained how to stop them so that problem is already solved.
---
If my town decided to let some WWE style shitshow roll in and hold up traffic and do public stunts that were an absolute nuisance right in the middle of the street but its cool because it brings the town more revenue due to the horde of fans that are suddenly swamping the area, I'm just a child if I was upset about it?  I'd much prefer they take it to another town, as its much easier for them to go somewhere else than for me to uproot and move to escape the nonsense.
---
?????
---
This is understated too much.
---
WoW gained momentum over 1-2 years in Vanilla.
---
Vanilla WoW was never a floodgate of 10 million people on the first night.
---
You sure about this, their stance when I played was corpse camping and ganking was acceptable.
---
If you play on a PvP server and advertise your location to the world, you deserve to get raided by numerous amounts of guilds. It is gonna happen. Props to the first guild that drops a guild recruitment post in to a streamer's chat after they run train on him for an hour.
---
Wrong, this subreddit has contributed to many changes already to the beta.
---
And this thread has 500 upvotes and it’s only been up 2 hours, other threads on layering are in the 3-4K upvote range, more traffic than /r/wow has got all weekend. I delight in your seething but your arguments are boring.
---
What if they get better servers
---
I don't think there's an option that pleases everyone. Merging you will lose out on character and guild names.
---
No more than sharding
---
They were doing some "community event" with their stream and a guy came up and ganked one of them. He was banned for griefing, happened live on stream. So yeah.
---
Dude that sounds so sick. I sent you a message. Let's talk more once you join the Discord.
---
Fuck this foreshadowing... I'm in the trash business and dont need this bad juju lol
---
No answer about the player base is going to be 100%. PvE players won’t care at all (aside from node abuse)
---
But it would ruin PvP servers for (I’d argue) _most_ players.
---
I'm talking about jumping layers to avoid PvP, find rare mobs, get multiple gurubashi chests, etc..
---
I'd like to see you do any of that with separate realms.
---
Enjoying the treasure of that boot polish?
---
asmon said it in a discussion with another streamer when trying to figure out a solution to this issue.
---
Sometimes Software Developers like to create software that no one really needs or wants to try to save money and make servers scalable to populations.
---
Honestly, that's about it.
---
I’m not too worried about this in general, despite picking shazz assuming Spain was going golem. However, it’s wishful to assume they’ll live up to the promise of a few people claiming they’ll speak Spanish since the rates of English speaking in Spain is around 25%, versus, say, 80-90% for Scandinavia
---
Hating the hurricane of negatives that a streamer brings to a server doesn't mean you're a child, it means you're observant
---
Two is the lowest amount of letters, but they get snapped up instantly. There's a two letter name I really want so I'm gonna try and grab it tomorrow, but if I don't get it, I also won't be surprised lol.
---
Scandinavians speak pretty good english, and is mostly friendly, so I would not worry about them.
---
Dude. Warriors can just stance dance anyways. Back in vanilla we raided all through naxx without a Dwarf priest. Fear ward is such a crock.
---
Just like the other guy said, sell your fish on the AH
---
Laughs in RP server
---
Because pvp is a game mechanic. You can fight back or get help from friends. There's nothing you can do to stop a group of people from killing the mobs you need.
---
Sounds like they fucked up with their implementation when they decided that
---
&gt;Welp, you clearly don't want to have a civil or sensible discussion,
---
Okay, Mr(s). Off Topic.
---
&gt; and already used words such as "mad" or "bad opinion" while laughing, 
---
Bad opinions deserve to be laughed at.
---
&gt;using emojis 
---
Emojis are ok.
---
&gt;and blatanly ignoring (ok.) context and points given
---
What did *you* want me to say? Most of the points didn't make any sense and were off topic. "Ok" was all I could say.
---
&gt;, resorting to the same cyclical dodging of issues.
---
Dodging what, exactly?
---
&gt;Just have a good day.
---
It's an amusing day, that's for sure.
---
So what's the latest in regarding the European PVE servers? Any big guilds or countries picking a certain one?
---
NEVAR!
---
I started out on an RP-PVP server. My worst memories didn't come from the RP side of things.
---
The streamer shit is the quick jab that had it wavering. The sharding shit coming to light right now might well be the hook that sends it home.
---
&gt; It's unfortunate for the Spanish people who are not proficient in English
---
Online games are a great way to learn english.
---
Regardless of what it does to the game culture I guess... Fuck that. I hate that. Now I'm grumpy.
---
stress test but tomorrow (monday) 08/12 you can login and reserve a name, actually official statement should be on the wow website
---
Because thats the only 2 locations that blizzard has servers in now.
---
You can except for on the pvp servers. Unless they’ve decided to change that rule, but that’s how it was in Vanilla.
---
&gt;Forgive me for being dissatisfied with the current state of layering, but doesn't compromising the integrity of the game in phase 1 undermine the entire project? 
---
This is an interesting way to ask a question considering that, guilds have stated their intentions of clearing MC/Ony within 2 weeks when the integrity of the game in phase 1 (retail) had a world first level 60 in 22 days?  You could say that people having had years to make the fastest and easiest level route to 60 compromising the integrity of the game.  In the current day you could never truly get back that experience of retail wow - where it was most peoples first time playing an MMO and started playing alone or with a friend or two from real life.
---
Making an exception for a zone is very different to “aggro radius”, which is a pretty ridiculous suggestion.
---
This. It baffles my mind when people ask for a new timeline after classic with more classic like content. How can you really trust these devs not ruin the game?
---
Roll a druid and eat rogues for breakfast.
---
No but if your sole purpose in life was to intimdate rogues and make them fear you, between a warrior and paladin the paladin strikes the most fear into rogues.
---
I mean the guy named his character Joanna as a female troll hunter.  The character is a she at least.
---
But tis a trap.
---
Yeah, monkey said they’d probably change their pick if they saw too many guilds rolling shazz to avoid them. I’d post the discord screenshot if I wasn’t on mobile
---
It isn't going to take layering out though. Which is my argument. Which I guess is boring to someone like you who is just so adamantly opposed to the idea of it.
---
The entire problem with phasing is inconsistent communities. Even if you managed to get an optimal 33/33/33 or even a 50/50 split the main problem of fractured communities still exists which is exactly counter to the classic wow experience. The early game matters just as much as the rest of the game and I don't think it's wrong to fight for the game we asked for.
---
Because like most brainwashed liberals, you hate for him is solely based on a political bias and you'll refuse to listen to anything that counters that. 
---
&gt;Ever heard someone talk about how people don't want to hold good opinions, they just want theirs verified? Or the ones that rather be told what to believe? The people who argue from emotion
---
The irony is palpable.
---
Repeating the same thing over and over, but the problem is that there *were* 100 people in the cities, you just never saw them because of layering.
---
One of the threads yesterday was of a guy trying to sell bags to people in Org but even though it was empty in his layer he had to invite people to see them. That's the issue.    
---
Now obviously your response is going to be "but it's just alpha/beta/stress test/release/phase 1" etc. Then my response is that I can't see blizzard fixing all these problems in 2 weeks and pretending these issues aren't a problem is why we're in this mess.
---
Its not when they want, its about when they will be able to.
---
the Chad option
---
You could always just not browse the reddit if you can't handle dissent.
---
If they open more servers between name reserves and launch based on a higher than expected "headcount," I could see them just giving everyone another 1-2 reserves.
---
Do...do you need a Snickers?...
---
Improved might is trash if you're lvling.
---
People can't wrap their heads around the fact that its better for the community to layer and then turn layering off than it is to spin up a bunch of individual servers and then have 50 dead servers 6 months from now and have to do server mergers.
---
Layering might be bad, but dead servers and server mergers are so much worse.
---
Blizz needs to remove it not fix it
---
You should lose to warriors,rogues, and mages and beat hunters. Warlocks don't have that good dps based on private servers, however classic is a tossup with boss resistances that may "buff" warlocks. Your call.
---
Sure thing bud.
---
I don't play Retail, but I was watching my brother play a few weeks ago and the view distance blew me away.  If Classic could replicate that I'd be very happy.
---
Hi guys! I'm planning on leveling a rogue as my first character in Classic.
---
I'd like to eventually end up with Alchemy/Herbalism, but I was curious -- is it at all remotely realistic to take Leatherworking/Skinning as I level up and head into the end game, and then drop them for my preferred professions? Or do you think it'd be too much of a hassle and too much time wasted?
---
Thank you for any and all advice!
---
Layering is the equivalent of miss using the Infinity Stones. People just be disappearing left and right.
---
huh weird
---
I feel like everyone’s been so hype about approaching launch, stress test, and servers this last week that we haven’t had the usual post-classic spam
---
And outside of Warmode it isn’t...
---
They are adding the option to do just this in the very near future. I’ve been talking to the Devs on discord to get this added in.
---
Hey settle down, Okay?
---
So you have to put in a little more effort to craft the community experience you want.
---
The "aggro radius" would be defined as a scene by the wow classic team, you are just trying to argue semantics because you are clueless.

It is good in pvp after it gets really good gear. Other than that, not really.
---
Yup, blizzard didnt give them their own server so it's up to us to divide by convenience, no harm no fowl
---
Think we have it bad imagine how Europe is having to figure out these subdivisions
---
You are going to log in and choose your server and create your characters in game, that's the only way.
---
That's why a 2nd monitor while lvling a paladin is a must. Gotta optimize your porn browsing.

---
I saw people constantly on the stress test the only issue I ran into was grouping with friends it took a bit to actually get one of us onto the right layer normally took a minute or two after grouping.
---
I do net believe vendoring the fish would make you a whole lot of money but putting the fish that alchemists use and deviate fish can net you money particularly because a lot of people wont be working on fishing while leveling.
---
Everything I read said it's character creation you just can't enter the world. I can't think of another way.
---
In fairness, the picture used for Nostalrius was during the shutdown party, which had 3x the people of normal everyday Ironforge, at least.
---
&gt; the server is going to have 1/5 the population of the others. 
---
Blizzard is providing the same amount of pvp servers as non pvp servers, why? Because unlike you they have representative data to work with. Do you really think a Reddit poll represents the actual playerbase? With how little servers there are there's absolutely no reason to worry about ANY of the starting realms in terms of player numbers.
---
I considered to go on a pvp server but for various reasons I'm going pve:
---
* I'll be playing alliance and alliance will most likely get dicked on in the contested zones since historically pvp has been more of a horde thing. I do like pvp but I prefer when it takes place in a somewhat even setting. 
---
* I baited my girlfriend into playing classic with me and she's new to the game and far from a pro gamer. She will absolutely not have any fun in world pvp.
---
* Especially on EU (where I'll be playing) I expect the pvp servers to be a toxic cesspool.
---
My first significant character back in Wotlk was a male Tauren Hunter. So close.
---
And no one else has gold to spend
---
More servers = dead servers post-hype.
---
How do you know layering won’t be removed if the community shows enough displeasure.
---
Are you a Blizzard employee?
---
That’s exactly what I mean by boring, you’re pulling things out of your ass for the sake of defending a company who owes you nothing against people giving critical feedback on a feature for a game that they’re going to pay money for. I’m pretty sure you’re just a troll but you spend way too much time on Reddit for me to be sure so /shrug.
---
Let's count the edge.
---
1. claiming censorship/attempting to pre-emptively shame people who disagree.
---
2. "Educating" people while simultaneously trying to shame them for being ignorant by TyPiNg LiKe ThIs.
---
3. Claiming the only reason people could possibly disagree with you is if they are stupid.
---
What a dumb post.
---
Meh. People were complaining about legion when it was current content. The wow community has a tendency to hype up the previous expansion. In legion, wod want to bad compared to the green dumpster fire they released and called legion.
---
You will see Bob the Orc when he's 60, after layering is turned off.  Might even see him before its turned off if he hops over to your layer after doing a dungeon group.
---
I'd rather occasionally not see Bob the Orc for the first few months than to meet Bobo the Orc after Bob had to get a name change when his server got merged with yours because they were dead.
---
No that's the normal way to do it. Leveling herb / mining while you are leveling to 60 is very hard to keep them balanced. Once you get your mount it makes it much easier and thats how you should do it.
---
As a warlock you can whack then wand, by the time you are back to melee the timer has reset. Between dots, voidy, life tap and the very occasional bolt you can dps for days with very little downtime. And then throw in juggling.
---
Mind that I figured this weird dps method on a private server so mileage may differ on retail.
---
Sure you are, but why would they be? No game company on the planet would be ok with their game being unplayable for the first week or two for the launch of an MMO.
---
&gt;if you really think how this would work, layering comes out on top.
---
Have you even thought about it? How having 100k+ players on 10 layered servers be a better solution?
---
I fucking hate it when Im given options
---
NOPE NADA SORRY
---
To add to op's question:
---
If I create a character and delete it right afterwards, is the name saved to my account for some time or can anyone grab it instantly? The reason is that I don't want to waste time customizing the character when I just want to grab the name as quickly as possible. The name could be gone while I'm choosing the hair for the character.
---
Some dude. Or just a fuck ton of servers to choose to be a part of. If one gets too packed and is slow AF ill move to a less packed one. Don't force people into separate layers, dropping a big stinking shit on any game culture that might develop or friend building opportunities.
---
You're the troll. Bye
---
Pretty sure its going down after tuesday
---
There is a legitamate point to be made about only using 1.12. That patch was made for that point of the game and does not reflect most of the patches prior.
---
Great example is that 1.12 let warriors outshine rogues as melee dps. Back in 05-07 rogues were extremely popular and in c;assic polls their third least played.
---
It would have been nice for each phase to have its own talent trees.
---
Hiding by the guards, I see.
---
True, but I remember at any time of the day Ironforge was *packed*.
---
Wtf are you talking about. The aggro radius is defined as a small circle around an npc that indicates the range at which it aggros onto a player.
---
You wrote
---
&gt;	They can just remove layering in the aggro radius of world bosses.
---
Words and expressions have a meaning, you know?
---
Yeah it would be a real shame if the raids didn't have 15 warriors in them :(
---
Yeah. He's even on his sub discord demanding his fans spam Blizzard to get "streamer early name registration" and that if anyone doesn't want to or doesn't think they should have this, they're a "streamer hater".
---
It's bonkers how self absorbed they are.
---
&gt; Name me one place that says you can not report someone for cheating.
---
you weren't talking about cheating tho. you said if you see a streamer, report. That's a paddlin'
---
i wonder how much of it was cuz our old au servers were us-west, which afaik should ping better than sydney.
---
kinda makes me wonder why they chose oceanic, time zone maybe?
---
Leave classic alone we want the game to stay as close to vanilla as we can now and in the future.

It could.

Swiftly was banned for causing a server wide DC once.
---
I was actually very surprised when he became unbanned. (This must have been sometime around 2012, anyone who wasn’t a fanboy likely first heard about him around then)

For at least a few years after that he was pretty cautious about big disruptive activities.
---
Hi all, I am going to play Classic on TW servers. 
---
Add my battletag (AnnDrew#2966), we could start playing on 1 server and see what happens
---
As a message I love giving out Arcane Intellect to warriors.
---
that doesn't make sense. they have even stated themselves multiple times that layering will do little if nothing at all to change queue times.
---
They use to have so much creativity!! They’ve become the movie industry of gaming. More about making the money than evolving the industry.
---
I just wanted 2 PvP servers so I could try and have all my alliance mates on one and horde on another so I can play with everyone.
---
Now I have to choose a faction because both groups want PvP server (and so do I)
---
People and companies are known to lie. Maybe they meant it at the time but something along the way forces to change it and we're stuck with it forever.

I can ask you the same question about your solution lmfao you're an actual joke.

Light's hope had 10k online and "didn't lag". You wouldn't even know there were 10k players unless you tipe .server info.
---
Why **Elwynn' ?**
---
for people who hate streamers so much, it’s weird that you’d willingly sign up to make your game experience revolve around them for years
---
this “resistance” will just give them more content, controversy, exposure...
---
the way to win this game is to not play. just pick a different server and you can live in peace.
---
that said, I salute the brave souls who will fight this battle. I just think it’s misguided and tunnel visioned.
---
That’s what I thought.
---
Wouldn't there be less layers with less players, potentially to the point that there is only one layer AKA a normal server?
---
Pvp realm is better to raid on, pvp players will also be raiding for the gear. Pve realms usually attract mostly casuals and weaklings (alliance).
---
Easier to farm materials too if you deny one faction from the zones.
---
No balance changes, EVER. The current Blizzard are incompetent as proven over the last decade.
---
You are clueless because you have no idea what a scene is. A SCENE is something defined by designers or the dev team. Like HILLSBRAD FOOTHILLS is a zone and a SCENE would be TARREN MILL. You are trying to argue semantics about something you literally have no clue about.
---
not what i was saying whatsoever
---
Some players are fine with layering. Some are not.
---
Blizz should let the players decide what they want. Have some realms with layering and some without.
---
But the first month will be way worse with any of the alternatives to layering. I don't get why people complaining about layering refuse to acknowledge that the alternatives are worse.
---
I wouldn't take the leatherworking as it won't help very much, just sell the leather you skin.
---
&gt;It feels a bit weird to talk about performance issues on a 15yo game.
---
Actually not if you think about it. Hardware is not the problem. But the software architecture. If your designed architecture sucks, your hardware won't help with your performance issues.
---
&gt;There's nothing you can do to stop a group of people from killing the mobs you need.
---
This is also part or the MMORPG genre. Competition within your own faction is a normal part of the game. If your both farming the same mobs you might have to leave and come back later. It's all part of the vanilla experience. Again that's the solution so its not like your helpless.
---
I am normally for play whatever class/race combo you want, but nothing with the Tauren racials synergizes with Hunter like at all. It isn't like they don't really synergize, they are really bad to the point of being useless, lol.
---
It's a bit unrelated because Australis, as far as I know (I'm not Australis), they censor/ban video games for sexual and violent content, rather than censor swearwords.
---
I still think he has a point though, but his post was merely meant to point a finger back rather than discussing the issue... also called whataboutism.
---
Umad lolllll
---
it was just a generous assumption typically made to get your opponent to see your side of the argument, that even with an amplified prediction like that with such a large margin of error, a huge problem still remains
---
Same reason the US has a constitution even though it's been ignored since it's inception.
---
I wish I had a girlfriend to bait into playing with me. That'd be awesome. Oh well. FOR THE HORDEEEEE!!!
---
was even worse before the heavy cross realming/warmode and all the horde/alli stacks were on different realms as well.
---
I assume it'll be open for the entire 2 weeks - with the "enter world" button becoming clickable at launch.
---
They haven't announced a "end time" for the name reservation.
---
Arms Warrior + Elemental Shaman. Good dps/healer for questing, good dungeon healer, WF totem, gear overlaps for both roles, and no gear competition between Arms and Elemental.
---
Seems I struck a nerve, that’s what I thought, all of you pro-layering loyalists have absolutely no substance in any of your arguments other than posturing.
---
The beta/stresstest client is the same as the release client
---
Why're people surprised? It's not layering, its SHARDING.
---
Me personally I was all for server merges back in the day over cross-realm stuff.  So what if people have to pick a new name, sit down and think be creative other than just picking OoIlldanoO.
---
You did not even use the word scene in your original reply. Spare me your attacks and insults.
---
The class balance in vanilla is pretty much indefensible for any reason other than wanting to preserve the original experience. That's fine. 
---
I don't think they should make any balance changes for classic, but they *could* definitely create a better game than vanilla or current retail if they took some vanilla design philosophies and tempered them a bit with a bit more balance. In fact, they already did that...it was called TBC.
---
Where are those numbers from? 20k on *each server*? I mean, the big (you know which) "free" vanilla server peak was about 17k, but that's the total number  of players from all over the world, when the game costs 0.
---
Chasing the dragon.
---
This is not beneficial if the target is low level and only able to receive the benefits of a rank 2 buff rather than ultilizing the max rank spell. Meaning that if you use this macro, you cast a rank 6 where you should have casted a rank 2, youre wasting your mana.
---
Yeah, the world felt so alive. There was always someone to group with for an elite quest. It had it's negatives but overall it was great.
---
God forbid we have grass
---
The game ran on integrated graphics in &gt;2004&lt;
---
there is also a reasoning for this, most people havent been playing the stress test. but yeah i agree that layering will damage the game experience if left as it is
---
Its only the big streamers that people are worried about.
---
Barov will go down (forever) and the characters will be deleted.
---
The 'live' server list will be available. 
---
You can reserve 3 names across any of the servers. You can have the same name on different servers. So you can have Thex-Herod and Thex-Pagle.
---
theres a difference between players and concurrent players tho, nost had something like 150 or 180k accounts with characters on them and a concurrent pop of like 10-12k.
---
Blizz said layering will be gone by the end of phase 1, but that could mean 3-4 months.  They are very hush hush on their actual plans of how they will use layering.
---
I want them to say two week max then we shut layering off and see what happens.
---
"loyalists" lmfao you're a real treat. Your own arguments are lacking any substance yourself. What a hypocrite
---
Right up until you're forced to change your name, then you'll be right here bitching up a storm that YOU'VE had this name for 15 years and its BULLSHIT that YOU have to change it.
---
Sorry if this is ignorant, but is the gear from LW just not worth it or something?
---
Go post on that subreddit instead of breaking the siderules of this one then.
---
I'm not, I took a week of work.  So did a lot of people.
---
Pretty funny cause low-effort memes definitely DO NOT get removed
---
&gt; Laering in Phase 1 so long as it is needed
---
You really don't see how that's vague?
---
They are removing it after a few weeks
---
"NO U"
---
Good argument.
---
Do it but bring a mage to all your dungeons because you will be drinking like a sailor.
---
Not a huge fan of his content, but anyone listening to a wow streamer for political discourse is looking int he wrong place.  thats my take.
---
Thanks for the answers!
---
How can they prove that? For the record, it’s not too hard to find certain players. All it takes is one lvl 20 to say “hey I Swifty is here in The Barrens, tell your guild” and you can corpse camp him without conflicting the ToS
---
Yup - this is a concern of mine. 
---
The stress test was hammered - and that's just a small sample of the folks who will be playing on release day (some folks didn't want to resub yet, some didn't have time off, some aren't interested in testing, etc). 
---
It's highly likely that 150k+ names will be reserved on a server before launch. Folks will want their primary name reserved on as many servers as possible. It'll be wild...
---
the lowest estimate for server pop is 300,000.  The Biggest streamers has an average of 15,000 people.
---
You're worried about 5% of a server pop.... really?
---
Thank you, so op's question becomes even more important. It might be a viable strategy to reserve a name with a shitty looking character, wait for a few days and at some point late at night quickly delete it and create the actual character.
---
This release is going to be like 2004, except worse.
---
ah yes, nothing fits my high fantasy undead zombie raid like EDM.
---
Idk if you ever played nostalrius, but accomplishing shit during peak hours on the pvp server was borderline impossible. You’d have people at literally every mob spawn point for bottleneck quests while leveling
---
The big deal is capital cities are ghost towns when they're supposed to be packed with people. Que times would  die down after the first week or two.
---
Only for about the first month, I imagine blizzard has a six step program in mind to help the servers transition between a layer to non layer system. It will probably be something like this. 
---
1. Anyone can flip between layers at time, so that friends can meet up with each other and whatnot. This will probably last about a month. 
---
2. Blizzard restricts layer switching to only in capital cities, probably using an NPCs to allow layer switching for 10g or something. This’ll also last about a month. 
---
3. Layer switching is removed, so at which those discord servers become useless because like war-mode you will simply be unable to see or interact with persons of a different layer¹. Will probably last a fortnight.
---
4. Full communication blackout between layers begins, any attempt results in error messages. This will last a week. 
---
5. Layering on servers is removed or in the case of over population, they are split. 
---
6. New servers open up and phase two begins. 
---
I’m willing to bed a large sum of money this is what blizzard has in mind. Now of course the best layer plans of mice and men are often doomed to failure so in all likelihood people one or more of these step may get skipped or left indefinite perpetuity. 
---
¹This would probably the time they introduce servers transfer, with the side benefit of switching layers for that sweet paid service revenue stream.
---
My main (warlock) was rocking a good 120days played in vanilla, Also got a few alts to 60 but no serious gearing, i think leveling something fast first is «ze best» so you can feed your alts with atleast weapons/wands, keeps it fun and wont burn you out
---
Masturbate.
---
There is going to be an insane demand for materials regardless of the supply. You are the one saying a high supply will ruin the market forever, whereas I am saying that a high supply is already going to be running into an almost insatiable demand - especially for things like flasks. 
---
I'm sorry that reality isn't all doom and gloom? Why are you trying so hard to be upset.
---

---
He's making me feel all fuzzy inside and i've done nothing.
---
Wouldn't make much sense to add a server suffix if the server was shutdown and no longer existed.
---
I already can see the 12 year olds harassing people "Hey look at this guy from &lt;servername&gt;, you're trash, go back to where you came from, oh wait, it doesn't exist anymore, hahaha!".  Random juvenile harassment aside, temporary layering is an infinitely better solution than server shutdowns and mergers, anyone who thinks a merger is the better choice has never had to deal with character migrations to/from dead servers in this, or any other game.
---
Why?
---
So server tech a decade later cant keep up with population demands for classic wow? What am I missing here, why is layering needed to address over pop issues. I mean I do remember being number 400 in que and hating it, but still seeing people everywhere especially with world pvp was what made this game great imo.
---
[It's basically this age-old meme.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg)
---
&gt; At the start, there were only auction houses in Ironforge, Orgrimmar, and Everlook. 
---
The original 3 AH's in BETA were IF, Org, and Booty Bay.  Booty Bay AH was moved to Gadgetzan in Tanaris as of [Patch 0.10](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_0.10).  Everlook had a guy who was a "Gadgetzan Representative" and did not have it's own formal AH.
---
Yes, but that isn't how it's functioning.
---
And in this scenario, the entire populace looked at the high prices of goods since nobody is selling and thought "no, I shall also not sell, I will wait for this thing to come crashing down, HAHAHA!".
---
You literally put the entire economy in a freeze spot, move forward months, assuming NOTHING has transpired, nothing has been sold, and then make the claim the economy would be busted. Of course it would be, in your netherworld of impossibilities.
---
I mean don't you still have to download something? What'd stop someone from tossing in a keylogger or whatever even if it isn't loaded in on a character or battle.net?
---
There's a group of Alliance in Durotar too.  I was just there but had to log.  Work early am D:
---
People just pulling random ideas out of the Random Idea Hat, or their ass.
---
"I really like [Random Idea], it would be so great if Blizzard foisted this upon the entire playerbase!"
---
Folks will be playing PvE as well. 300k sounds a bit extreme. If servers start getting over 60k I think Bliz will look into opening new servers. 
---
For reference, vanilla wow had under 5k per realm. "Healthy" pservers had under 10k.
---
If a server has 300k players - and 10% of them stay around, that's 30k. That isn't tenable once layering is disabled. The server login queues will be insane.
---
I thought the spell would cast as a max rank and the effect would scale down on the target, I was 100% that's how it worked. Oh well, I've deleted my comment, dont wanna be misleading anyone.
---
Thanks
---
You guys are just asking for it to be filled with non-RPers
---
So truly special it is.
---
Serious Question:  It seems like every single realm has competing groups of people opening discords and subreddits and trying to derail the "competition".  What motivates this behavior?  The power of moderation and control?  Online celebrity status?  Boredom?  
---
I took a look at one of the WhiteMane subreddits and one of the first things posted was basically waif porn.  I wish you guys luck, but if your subreddit and discord are going to be the ones most folks use, consider figuring out a way to separate the complete 12 y.o. kid garbage from posts that most people will find helpful and that will create a sense of "community".  Otherwise, the only people who will go there will be 12 y.o. boys.
---
Retail holds names for at least a few hours, although this was not the case in 2004. My guess is it will function like retail and names will be tied to accounts for a short while.
---
In all honesty, I think you’re looking at something worse than just Tuesday maintenance.  I suspect we’ll have rampant 3000-7000 person queues, general instability, and probably quite a few hours of downtime during the first week to address instability and overlooked near game breaking bugs.
---
One of my favorite things to do on private vanilla servers on my hunter. Never gets old.
---
That’s fine, but they better have an RP appropriate name
---
rog use swords
---
I dont have to have that, i will have the Heord with side of Whitemane,
---
I am reserving my anger towards layering until phase 2. If they are being honest I'll have no reason to be upset and it'll be gone by then.
---
Don't worry about what I'm doing in Goldshire Inn as a ghost.
---
/r/atiesh represent!
---
Yeah I think a lot of people misunderstood the question as being /played and not /lived
---
And it was only because it was new. Most of the playerbase had no idea that there are such things are raids, most of the playerbase was below level 60. Classic won't be like that - people know everything inside out, have perfected their 2 button PvE rotation, know their BiS and so on. There won't be any difference in terms of feeling betwen classin and retail
---
blizz got some work to do
---
I really hope that there is going to be a poopsocking guild from private servers with one goal - making streamers experience as insufferable as possie.
---
where you able to import any configs?
---
All 3 of those choices will be just fine in dps roles.  I'd safe crafting in vanilla can, be nice if you chose a profession combination that allows you to make your gear as you level, but otherwise it's not really necessary.  You should definitely grab 2 gathering professions though if you don't want to craft otherwise you're just leaving money on the ground.
---
A shaman will probably be asked to heal in raids, the damage specs really don't scale well and you have to be extra tryhard just to compete in a better guild, or hope to get in as a slot filler.
---
How’s raid finder?
---
Okay yeah tried it and it messed up my UI bad. Yeah Ill wait till after release.
---
Why is this still happening??? It’s like a nightmare!!!
---
We’ve been complainin about layering for months now and it’s *still* broken? It doesn’t even act the way they said it should be acting!
---
Who came up with this layering idea in the first place? It doesn’t even make sense on paper! Why would you want a system where if you group up with one friend it makes your other friend disappear? It’s like a sick joke.
---
Who is over-engineering this?
---
does the Night elf starting area tend be less populated on server launch?
---
Alliance or Horde?  
---
I'm still so torn. Horde is obviously superior for pvp and questing easy, but since it's more popular it makes me want to roll alliance.
---
perv
---
I plan to UD priest
---
Challenge is retail mythic difficulty, vanila 'design' wasnt' a challenge, but rather inconvenience.

This is content, that's great, in my opinion. I don't see him being a shitbag, but you said you thought he were, or atleast always were online, so I thought I'd share these references.
---
I like his streams. He reads chat a lot, Mcconnell is cool. Asmon gets in a low withdrawed mood sometimes but hey I do the same so that's okay. He's really enthustiastic about the game, and that's contagious for me I feel. I like his personal stories as well, Zackrawrr his personal yt is great.
---
With the "layering", it's likely nobody would even be in the human starting place.
---
Realized I forgot this; For the Horde!
---
I’m indifferent but it’s totally reasonable to not want to play with the *rabid fans* that come with streamers.
---
Except for Mulgore, that place looks a little geometric.
---
You really cant be this obtuse can you?
---
Everything youve posted today is all BS you made up because hes conservative. 
---
&gt;The kind of people that would argue for slavery if they were alive during that time. The kind of people who are willfully ignorant about things like systematic oppression and "gender" (The cultural definition of "gender" not medical). The kind of people who see "13% population and 50% of the crime" and ignorantly assume that it's because of race, and not the racist society and, subsequently, government that caused it.
---
just stfu already, you have no leg to stand on. never once has that been on a stream because if it was the lefties would have him banned. stop being an NPC, think for yourself for once in your life
---
Yes, it is. Whether you should migrate there from your starter zone to level is questionable.
---
I am a representative of the largest confederation of dwarf-only guilds in the region. We have already claimed pagle and as a result we respectfully ask that no other allies roll any race besides dwarf. Horde can also only roll troll. 
---
Any alliance who break this law will be put into the book of grudges, and blacklisted from receiving fearward. Any non-troll horde will be shot on sight.
---
Thank you for your time and understanding.
---
Who would want to play the most iconic mmorpg to date? It started the explosion of a genre and had disgusting success. But nobody is interested tho right? Do you have to lube to get your head that far up your own asshole or do you do it often enough to not need any?
---
Good, I'll enjoy my servers without people like you
---
Thanks mate.
---
no. 
---
if you murder the everloving crap out of a streamer, on a PVP server, and he bawls about it to get you blocked from future groups? that's seriously fucked up, and anyone supporting that sort of behavior needs to take a step back and look at their priorities. 
---
if they don't want to be murdered, they need to roll PVE. 
---
End of discussion.
---
Exactly what Maehdras said.  
---
3k pops without layering? They'd need over 100 servers.  
---
Layering is here for the life of WoW classic
---
Esfand thinks he’s superior to us plebs and is demanding pre-registration for his name reserve
---
What time do name reservations open up? 5:00 CST?
---
This is just... total bullshit. People are acting like we haven't had merges in the live realm that have gone smooth, aka "Connected realms." 
---
Being from a low population RP server it was great to see an injection of players.
---
Man I used to like Soda but everything I’ve seen of him lately has been so fucking obnoxious.
---
&gt;On bfa launch most realms were down for hours before it was playable
---
Was not the experience I had. For BFA or for Legion.
---
Esfand thinks he’s superior to us plebs and is demanding pre-registration for his name reserve!
---
It's an interesting share.
---
why take the multiplayer away from the mmo? christ blizzard, heads out of the rectal cavities.
---
If I'm trying to farm cloth for reputation and/or tailoring, what are some of the best mobs to grind to kill two birds with one stone? e.g. farming argent dawn or timbermaw rep.
---
I mean it is toxic.  Just because there's different extremes of toxicity doesn't mean a shite post literally laughing at the OP is somehow NOT toxic.
---
Where are these delusional fanbois getting these numbers?
---
Depends on what class you are going, you may want devilsaur gloves and legs but you can just get someone else to make them for you, its not worth.
---
Can you be logged in already before 5, or will the servers only appear online after you log in at 5?
---
You mean in raiding? Because instants get crap spellpower co efficient. So yes the base amount may hit for similar numbers but with +400 spell damage frostbolt will hit far harder.
---
To be honest I do think that like 90% of people do end up not actually wanting it. Total guess, but I just have a feeling that the vast majority won't even hit 60. They will get bored because of how used to QOL from retail (and other games) they are
---
How many of raids can a person do per week? I know instances is like 5 per hour or something close to that, what’s the raid limit.
---
Hey, that's my name!
---
If you have a NA Blizzard account, the Oceanic realms are probably the best. They're hosted in Aus. Pacific coast isn't that bad, I'd imagine. Maybe 200ms.
---
If you have a Blizzard China account - I think you're limited to just the Chinese servers (which they will have, I heard).
---
A reasonable person not spewing hate blindly? Hmm... wrong sub for that my dude
---
And that's a problem why? That's three names. or if you count all streamers... like 80 ish names.  Of which are specific to their content or online identity.
---
Unless you're aiming for the name... Esfand. Why does it matter?
---
you download a zip of lua source files that are ran within the game client, not an executable.
---
Okay, keep your swears out of my game.
---
Who's ass is he kicking? He will be carried on most of the content. Also, I did not meant it as an offense, but I literally fell asleep on some of his streams. He is funny, he is chill, but his gameplay is boring.
---
Mankrik will be 40/60, but I betcha Pagle will be like 75/25. So Mankrik will feel much more balanced than Pagle, and it won't be close.
---
When did he claim he wanted to be treated like everyone else? It’s not unreasonable to be okay with getting the good things that streaming offers but still not be okay with getting stream sniped. Those two things don’t have to be linked together. Just because someone else does something nice for him doesn’t mean you or anyone else needs to balance it out by being a dick.
---
I had adream that Blizzard changed their mind and opens up and RP/RP-PVP server in Australia. Also there was world peace and brownies without calories:
---
Can someone ELI5 what ‘layering’ is? I googled it but I didn’t quite understand it
---
I dun want it
---
Cool. still not griefing.
---
I'm just kind of idly watching the fire burn at this point. I wish we could go back to memes. Tired of reading the same layering / streamer threads over and over. At the same time I sort of love it. It's like people watching. Watching people bicker and argue. People here seem to love to pull figures and stats out of their ass.
---
Yes but be careful because even in that small timeframe you want to customize your character someone can snatch it
---
Yes.
---
only on this subreddit.

Nice self reflection
---
Everybody disliked that.
---
but what about all those gamerdads that only have 30minutes to play? lets change vanilla so they too can have fun!

This is a serious issue. Dozens of families suffer every year. It’s important to raise awareness.

No its literally not. You don't know what you're talking about. Phasing is a tech introduced in Wrath that splinters characters within a specific zone based on progression through a specific questchain. Almost all of ICC was phased, so a player who had completed the entire questline would literally never see a player who had just started (unless they grouped). Layering is a tech that is in development specifically for Classic. It creates a virtual server across one of the two continents within the Classic world of Azeroth. Its purpose is to mitigate starter zone congestion in the first weeks of Classic launch. It has nothing to do with character or quest progressions. Nor is it zone-specific like sharding from retail is. 
---
If you change instances of an appearance of a zone because of a quest completion or progression, you got phased. If you change instances of an appearance of a zone because you entered a new area or a new group while playing retail wow, you got sharded. If that happens in Classic wow, you got layered. They are different things and the terms are not interchangeable.
---
I wish the tech is there to have in-game option-Isolate me or-Let me lag plox.
---
dungeons are way easier than p servers, u can spam them wicked fast with cleave groups. the XP is now faster than quest/grind
---
I'm pretty happy as well to be honest, we know for sure the active PVP players will be on Arugal and the active raiders will likely be on Remulos, it's easy to pick a server.
---
Obviously there will still be raiders on Arugal, I just mean the playerbase who don't like world pvp getting in their way will be on Remulos.
---
If you're interested, I am leading a casual-friendly Horde guild on Herod. We plan to raid just once a week with an optional weekend one for people who need flexibility. We will have lots of family men and also casuals who don't plan on raiding at all. We're also already well-established (80+ members) and organized.

Your sarcasm is duly noted. You can hate BfA and use actual reasons instead of making stupid, feeling based claims about the sub count.
---
There's more than a million subs, anyone who says otherwise has brain damage.
---
That's correct. That's crazy! But isn't layering a software issue, not so much a hardware issue?
---

&gt; In legion, wod want to bad compared to the green dumpster fire they released and called legion.
---
nobody ever said this
---
people complain about the current content for sure but there was literally nobody saying they wanted WoD back, there's a reason why there are thousands playing Legion privates and there is almost no WoD private community at all
---
Video is in Finnish.
---
Use the old system. That's the solution. Technology is better now.
---
solo optimized hunter (mage and lock maybe also) will be faster than dungeon spam.
---
Really I keep hearing nice things to the point that I'm toying with the idea of rolling on RP-PvP.
---
I never did, i said the profanity filter should have more words added that has no impact on you.
---
Why? im here for the pvp.
---
try doing it as fast as you can
---
Rumor has it with the layering tech each server will support 40-50K concurrent players.
---
Correct. It’s a DoT that heals you for a bit. 3 minute CD.
---
are you able to move the quest tracker on the top right? i can't seem to find out how to move it
---
This is the shit that killed retail.
---
&gt;Why? im here for the pvp.
---
Good.
---
There were single private servers that had up to 14k online at once on a single server, and the population still spread out after 2-3 weeks.
---
I think it's safe to say that Blizzard can handle population with more servers if necessary.
---
&gt;it took multiple steps to get the client
---
....what? You could directly download the .rar file or torrent it. That's not "multiple steps".
---
&gt;servers could be deleted at any point
---
That's just one thing you had to accept, but really, lots of people (myself included) enjoyed the thrill of starting off fresh, hence why fresh servers were so popular.
---
&gt;many were P2W
---
So don't play those servers, lol
---
Is anyone else running into these? Changing your shadow settings fixes it, but they come back later. 
---

What a nuanced response. /s
---
Mine seems to only work on ones applied to myself but for instance I can’t see how long is left on flame shock for my shaman?
---
Between 200 (players) and 500 thousand (players) seems like a reasonable estimate, lot's of room on the low and high end.
---
I played on an unofficial Spanish realm in Vanilla and I barely even noticed them.
---
Well shit, wish someone would've told me that 14 yrs ago
---
You cant see people in Ironforge on other servers either. So go rage quit, because people are in ironforge on other servers, right this second. You can't see them.
---
Thats your logic. I'm not making any leaps here, that is literally your logic.
---
The difference is that layers will be able to as close to seamlessly as exists reintegrate these communities as the population wains. 
---
All of the wotlk anecdotes are related to a different technology not applicable to layering. Also, I counter your anecdotes with "never had that experience at all."
---
didn't you know this is only stress test? it will be totally different on release.
---
also the Gestapo will probably cleanse this thread soon.
---
melee weave
---
Yes, that's because of layering. No one is disputing that. What the other user mentioned was that zones were always instanced. That's how the game can be so massive while having minimal loading screens while travelling. It loads and unloads zones dynamically as you move around, including all players in them.
---
Running back and not seeing the same players is an additional symptom of layering - which sucks.
---
this is the best thing ever
---
I suddenly l accidentally bought factorio like a week ago...
---
The majority of players playing on day 1 or 2 will be gone within 3 months.
---
Right! I think were mostly waiting on a database to be made or something... guess we gotta do it the old way for a while
---
People are comparing stream sniping to using tools/cheats/exploits which is BS.
---
If someone decided to wear bright pink in a Paintball area while also having a loud radio attached to his head then it's his own fault for getting shot.
---
But people are still willing to side with Streamers on this.
---
Omg I know.  There is something so awesome about the old objects with new lighting
---
Git link: https://git.tukui.org/Tukz/Tukui/tree/Classic
---
I don't think it's on the official Tukui website yet (https://www.tukui.org).
---
Read the comments.  They put the threshholds for layering "much lower" than they will be on launch, in order to test some things.
---
i've literally only seen cons from this whole system. i personally don't care about overcrowded starting zones, i don't care if there's mergers later on. I want to be able to see people on my server 100% of the time. I want to be able to see guilds on my server 100% of the time. I want the community. I don't want to get fucked in combat because stuff is phasing in and out. I don't want my friends to phase out and have to log in and out for half an hour just to be able to play together again.
---
I think that’s where I’m going. It seems to be just sliding by without anyone noticing.
---
But if you are that fast, wont you hit the dungeon limit fairly quickly ? What then ?
---
Why tho, just curious
---
I do think they have the ability to turn it off. It has been mentioned that they will after the first wave gets pass the starter zone. So idk.
---
Dang, you beat me to the joke.
---
40 man every 7 days, onyxia every 5 days, 20 mans every 3 days.
---
No.
---
Yeah our connection to Asia is garbage, I remember back in the day when a game (don't remember which, Tera maybe?) promised Australian servers then put the damn things in Korea.  It was like 200ms MORE latency than playing on the existing US servers.
---
You spelled Alliance scum wrong.
---
I’m like 90% sure he has a law degree. it was either that or psychology. and he used to work reading over tax forms is what i remember. so I’m pretty sure he would be completely fine if he didn’t stream
---
Do you honestly think there will be any major changes between the final stress test and release 2 weeks later?
---
I hate the new water, the rest I am good with.  New water means no more water breathing ambushes.  This makes me sad :(
---
3-4 million? How exactly do you figure out those numbers, or are you just making it up?
---
the people wanting a pure classic experience are not the same people playing current retail WoW though, at least the vast majority
---
They wont.
---
youre prob not finishing SM 5 times in an hour, even then its still faster
---
The First few weeks and early months could be the same.
---
First few weeks (8~ weeks is not a long time) could also be early months (the first two months of launch)
---
We had first pre register, but what about second pre register?
---
Mankrik will most likely be horse dominant because servers named after horse characters tend to be like that. Pagle is also a human character so probably gonna be ally mainly.
---
I haven't played since vanilla. I haven't had a wow sub since vanilla. If this goes live. I'm not wasting my time on it. The first time I see something like layering, or sharding. Whatever they call it. I'm out.
---
Honestly - I think picking a low-ish pop server is the best thing to do if you want a world first.
---
The highest pop servers have the highest chance of lagging out or crashing for hours and hours on launch.
---
You’re saying that instant spells don’t get the full benefits from spellpower?

\&gt; people complain about the current content for sure but there was literally nobody saying they wanted WoD back
---
exactly, I didn't hear a single person asking for WoD to get back, it was considered by pretty much everyone one of the worst xpacs ever.
---
Legion, on the other hand, was great and a lot of people miss it (I do a lot).
---
1440p is the sweet spot in modern wow now.  4k is as always awesome, but 2k has that ever so sweet 144Hz saturation.
---
What does that mean
---
 RemindMe! 15 days
---
I would have nothing against them getting early reserves and I don’t even watch streams. The streams help WoW’s popularity, why would you not want someone’s brand name protected when they are giving you a lot of publicity?
---
1 of each raid per reset. You enter a raid in progress (or kill a boss in a fresh raid) and you get saved to that raid ID for 3/5/7 days depending on the raid. You can't enter any other ID of that raid until it resets.
---
Example: I do MC with my guild on Thursday, this means that I can't do enter another guild's MC until the reset day.
---
* MC/BWL/AQ40/Naxx reset on tuesdays (or wednesdays for EU).
---
* Onyxia resets every 5 days.
---
* ZG/AQ20 reset every 3 days.
---
Yeah man.  When they first announced "layering" I laughed out loud and flamed a post about it.  Then more and more people were coming out of the woodwork and explaining how different the mechanics are, etc.
---
I got self conscious and deleted my post and drank the koolaid just like all the others idiots on here.
---
We are all idiots.
---
nice time, but that won't get you even close to top3. maybe on a pve server
---
Same problem here on my 5700xt. Ultra settings. Only sometimes.
---
I dunno, Im stuck between Herod, or Faerlina. Someone help convince me.
---
Tasked with literally just recreating a game they made 15 years ago. Fucks it up.
---
Well they should listen because layering in its current form is a pile of shit. If they'd just sharded/layered the level 1-10 zones... I'd still be sad about it but I'd understand it. Continent wide is a huge mistake. I imagine not a small number of people will leave because they'll get to capital cities and see like 5-10 people and think it's a dead game. 
---
Or maybe, like me, the biggest reason they want Classic is because of its LACK of bullshit like sharing. Then when they login to the same server as their friends and can't see each other, how are they going to feel?
---
"BRB redoing the whole classic project in less than 2 weeks"
---
*-Blizzard probably*
---
We don’t know. They aren’t announcing. As they do announce check [here](https://www.avoidstreamers.com). But we may not know until launch.
---
🐎
---
Taking the files out of the master file did the trick. 
---
Man I forgot how awesome ElvUI is. Its literally a do it all addon. The only problem I had was that the track quest text ran into the minimap in the top right and couldn't figure out how to move the quest track text. 
---
Thank you for the help!
---
The one that made me laugh was my wife's first encounter with going OOM. She played a priest and a mage up past 70 in retail, and never once heard the voice cue advising her that her spells were cut off until she sat down and drank a liter of water. She played for two minutes as a Dwarf priest on the stress test and shouted "Oh my gawd, that can *happen*??"
---
Remind me what BR means? I’m unfamiliar with it
---
easy solution: register the streamer name to make them reroll somewhere else.
---
Thank you
---
Getting hacked in 2019....lol, authenticator...? virus scanner...?
---
Try disabling ssao.
---
Thank you! I thought I saw that Faerlina was going to be a Spanish speaking server as well? Is that incorrect?
---
100%.
---
I'll take it any day over even more community destroying and game destroying mergers.
---
One of the better combos 
---
Anything that can heal is good for lock, so is kinda anything else. They have good damage, self reliance, and flexibility.
---
Shadow Priest &gt; Priest &gt; Druid &gt; Pal/Sham &gt; other
---
Because a solid two thirds if the 1-0 default action bar bindings are really dumb in terms of ergonomics, and you’ll be a much faster player assigning those buttons to things like Q and E- buttons that are actually a reasonable reach away from the WASD cluster.
---
WoW’s default keybinds are bad, and you’ll be a better player if you spend some time thinking about your keyboard hand and what you can actually reach without repositioning or overextending and mapping accordingly.
---
[Yes](https://www.strawpoll.me/18451127/r)
---
This is only for the English speaking servers. What about the other 3 pvp servers? One would expect a differently skewed chart if they were included.
---
[Kargoz warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM) leveling guide - great classic content creator that goes into depth about it.
---
airport is working fine, under SW is fine also. didn't try under IF or darkshore.
---
Every class can add something to a raid group when played in the position they excel at. However, the position they excel at may not be the one you want to play.
---
Why don't we worry about that in 2-3 years? We have an entire game to enjoy now. Just enjoy the game now, and eventually the game may progress, or it may not. We will fins out.
---
I've been testing on retail and my connection to west coast is 20ms lower than oce.
---
Also I get more random spikes playing oce.
---
Let me know which realm you decide but I'll be playing Whitemane from japan
---
I'm in NY and used to play WoW on a west coast server. 80ms on west coast and 30ms on Chicago servers.
---
Not a single way?
---
Weird, I wonder how they did that the first time.
---
INB4 “uuuuh but the servers were literally always offline during any world boss raid uhh server DC”
---
BfA was instantly available and smooth for me on Sargeras and Emerald Dream which were high pop. Legion was as well I think.
---
Yeah, people have to report it. But you can be suspended or banned for swearing in public chat channels (which, yes, includes /say and /yell). It just rarely happens because it's rarely reported.
---
They clarified a few years ago that the presence of the mature language filter doesn't negate the rule, either, with some analogy about burglar alarms not making burglary legal. It's been a while.
---
!remindme 15 days install this
---
Hit 60 in under 4 days /played.  
---
Hunter is actually one of the best classes for skill cap when levelling because you have huge mobility and melee weaving and have to manage mana. You can always be doing things better.

---
You however, are not prepared.
---
When referring to the starting zones he was only acknowledging that was where the biggest problem would be. He didn’t lie about shit and you need to chill out
---
That won't change with layering though. Everyone you see is still on your server.
---
Has there been a statement that it is continent wide? Capital cities are some of the most ass packed areas in the game and they are all directly adjacent to starter zones. So I have no doubt they are lumped in with them as far as phasing goes.
---
We raided up to aq 40 with out first off tank only speaking Japanese. Gyuutan was a fine tank.
---
&gt; sorry, it sucked in the past so we have no choice but for it to suck now
---
This isn't vanilla remastered.
---
At the end of Vanilla, WOW had 8 million worldwide subscribers.
---
If just 5% of that turn up to play Classic, you're looking at 400,000 players playing on 28 total servers worldwide.  
---
Which is 14000 players on each server. Obviously not all concurrently, but they all would be for the launch.  
---
Personally, I think that's a gross understatement of the number of people who will resub to play.
---
Multiple reasons. Its fun to compete (for me). I will be playing the game a ton anyway so might aswell take it abit more seriuosly and try to "get something out of it" (I know many people would'nt consider somethjing like this an achievement , but I do). 
---
Its easier to find a powerfull guild when you're among the first to hit max level. 
---
And some more minor motivations.
---
You don't play a spec, you play a class.
---
Also, good luck trying to balance any of it in a way that makes everyone happy
---
&gt; why have classes that are irrelevant because other classes do it better?
---
Blizzard were getting close to 10 years of development when they were releasing WoW, EverQuest was becoming stale and the playerbase was upset with Sony. Blizzard decided to push for a release that would come before EQ2's release, to try to scalp disgruntled players.
---
&gt; Why do vanilla players insist they keep this even though they know it is clearly imbalanced?
---
People will play what they want to play regardless of balance for the most part. Changing classes would mean reprogramming a bunch of archaic stuff already, and the effects it'd have on all dungeons and raids would need to be tested again.
---
Play without a pet and only use yourmelee abilities
---
&gt; Why do vanilla players insist they keep this even though they know it is clearly imbalanced? 
---
Preserving nostalgia. Also, Blizzard has fucked up too many times for people to trust them to make positive changes so they rather have no change at all. I expect that this mentality will dominate for a while but as soon as we are a few months into the last phase and servers start to slowly die the idea of change will become more acceptable for people.
---
This was a cool video/surveys and I really enjoyed it. How much of the WoW classic player base would you guys guess participated in it?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow
---
This is the last straw
---
It's layering, not sharding.  Yes, they're similar.  No, they're not the same thing.
---
Pull more mobs.
---
Glad to hear it works! I moved the buffs and minimap left slightly, not perfect but oh well. I'm sure it be updated often! Best of luck on your classic adventure.
---
Is this true regardless of group setup ? Or do these runs only count for 4 Warriors 1 Shaman groups ?
---
Sounds like blizzard has somehow gotten even worse at hosting servers than in the past
---
I can see that happening. Like when website names are taken to sell to corporations.
---
Thank you so much
---
Agree totally as long as it does not delay the release day.
---
Again, what dont you agree with. It's a simple question. There is a huge difference between actually WoW players, and the casual scene I'm sure you are part of.
---
Thing is, even if it is just a low threshold for testing purposes, who cares? If I want to sell an item to a player, open a lockbox, give them an enchantment, I don't want to have to gimmick my way into their layer to do so, that kills all immersion. It's horrible.
---
Enable layering for the first 2 days only in the first 2 starting zones, that's it. That's all you need.
---
Well , kinda hard to pick a low-pop realm when there arent many servers to begin with.
---
Spartan is lovely and he has multiple "art" designs that will be usable. nUI can actually take up a fair chunk of screen which can bug you or not depending on your preference. I used it for years it's quite good, I have swapped to spartan these days, use it in both retail and classic. Wut is a very active dev and has discord and such as well
---
Ive only had this happen with questie being installed, I switched to ClassicCodex and have no issues.
---
But you are the zombies
---
They couldn't ban him unless he asks, directs, implies or anything else that the disruption should happen.  I think he might get a pass because "streamer favortism" and it is hard to prove he is the cause unless he specifically said to do it.  It is kind of like using the report function on him.  While technically it did happen, it is hard to prove the cause.  
---
So while I think a lot of things will probably go under the radar, if he says "We will go fuck up that server", and does, that would be bannable since he directly said to do it.
---
Having to wait for launch bad
---
Classes are balanced more or less.  Specs are not.  Every class is welcomed in a 40man raid for even the most hardcore guilds.
---
This also mostly only applies to endgame.  Beastmaster hunters, Demonology warlocks, enhancement shaman, feral druids, are all excellent levelers and really only fall off when people start get purples.
---
What do you guys map to your mouse buttons? I just have 4 go to spells for quick access but I feel like I should be doing more with it. Any suggestions?
---
Layering is essentially the only technology Blizzard needs to test. The content and mechanics and general functionality has been around for over 15 years now. So really this is absolutely nothing like the BFA beta.
---
It is completely obvious that Blizzard have been tinkering with layering throughout the beta and stress tests so they can actually test it properly (which they have already said was the case) those tinkering are going to have varying results on player experience. But the point of this is to understand the technology in its entirety and to expose bugs and flaws so that they can be fixed.
---
There is no main layer ^_^
---
A might elf warrior? Gross ;)
---
In essence - people want the original experience.
---
It's like eating mom's cooking. Is it gourmet? Nope. Is it some of your favorite food? Yep. And it would feel weird if she changed the recipe - even if it became objectively 'better'. 
---
That's the emotional side of the argument, at least.
---
The practical argument is changes are unpredictable. You could change the entire dynamic of the game with balance changes. 
---
Prot paladin is one of the examples of a totally unplayable class (in raids). But they can dominate 5man content - especially undead 5mans. The class unbalance gives you opportunities to prove yourself.
---
This isn’t about seeing people on _other_ servers.
---
If you played anything before MoP you would (or should, judging by your comment) know what a regular city looks like.
---
If your name is that hot, you know what you’re getting in to.  For the normal player you sound a bit over the top about it.  I don’t even have a name picked out, for the other side of the spectrum. Probably will just make it up on the spot.
---
It has to feel like a world not a game.
---
You really are missing the point. He's arguing that once the population is spread out across zones it will no longer be necessary, and thus will be manually disabled by blizzard.
---
It's an argument about the intent of blizz and how long they will keep layering online, not the mechanical system.
---
Yeah that tracks
---
I ran census on our stress test server and we had 2.1k players active at peak time. Tried that on one of the American servers and it couldn't finish because too many people but estimated that servers pop at about 15k
---
for the horse!
---
cleave groups def are gunna be the fastest, but the XP is still the best with any comp (if they are all going for max XP and know what they're doing)
---
Alright yeah but why would people be idling in Stormwind when they have leveling to do?
---
In vanilla, the PvP/PvE split was roughly equal. I think it'll be 60pvp/40pve this time around. If I had to guess on a low pop, I'd say RPPvP.
---
If you call 10 people in Org a community haha, layering is shit, called this months ago, same Blizz apologists than, same now.
---
There's a ban on private server names?
---
You can't be serious...
---
They need to do something post classic or the lifespan of the game is 2 years or so before it is basically done for.
---
world coherency matters, how do you form a community if who you see changes from day to day or hour to hour?
---
What theyre going is functionally having dozens of servers, but have you pushed to different servers occasionally to shuffle out player load.
---
I heard streamers got early access this weekend to reserve names.
---
There will though. Since there are no transmogs. People are able to wear their progress and it creates a certain status around people.
---
Every single video and clip of people jumping around layers is EXACTLY like phasing or sharding, just with a different name. Calling it a swan doesn't make it a swan. 
---
I've been complaining for days, and i've sent multiple reports and other emails to higher-ups in blizzard and i will continue to do so. I'd rather not see classic destroyed because of this.
---
If you are a Mage, use this instead:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
I can't speak to him wanting early name registration, but he definitely never said he wanted a black list. that was Sodapoppin.
---
Your friend lied to you about what he got banned for.
---
Apologize for what exactly? Voicing my opinion that everything I've seen of layering has been a shitshow? I'll be super happy if it works seamlessly at launch and I can always see my friends and capital cities aren't ghost towns. I'll be super relieved my fears were for nothing.
---
Here’s hoping.
---
Brazilian
---
The level cap is 20 isnt it?
---
why would people be hanging out in major cities between 1 and 20?
---
I mean, the litterally came out and said as much.
---
[...I think one of the unique apsects of WoW classic is that because anyone with an active WoW subscription can jump in and check it out, we think there are going to be a lot of players who are just curious.  They just want to see what it's all about, but they're not really seriously committed to playing in the long term....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236)
---
Isn't censoring something you decide personally in the options menu?
---
then thats even more stupid that they paid more money for a worse solution
---
streamer vs Spanish vs +30 ms west
---
Is there an individual button add-on so that I wouldn't have to download an entire bar add-on?
---
Layering is continent wide. That's how it works. Capital cities were always empty for me when I visited them during the stress test.
---
1 PvP server for NA is enough? Are you high?
---
Well I know its a bit of a cloud dream . But the way I make it realistic (in my head atleast) is that I've usually been around top 10 for my class (which is the only thing I care about anyway) on P-servers. Consdiering that none english realms are usually quite abit less competetive on those regards , I might place abit higher then usually , so maybe top 3 is possible afterall. 
---
Are 5-man grinds good regardless of group composition ? Or is it only better then solo questing with a 4 War/1 Sham setup ?
---
Are you sure?
---
Whitemane it is.
---
If we are on the same realm bc happenstance or bc I join this Dad guild, I’ll make you the lv 5 and 13 wands free.
---
ssurv
---
Is there an individual button add-on so I wouldn't have to download the whole bar add-on?
---
As far as anyone knows, there is no priority. (Although I wouldn't be that bummed if they gave folks prio.)
---
If they have their names taken, I guess they just choose different names? Although it's probably their chats who will steal the name - and maybe they'd ransom it or something? It's anyones guess really.
---
They didnt
---
No class was really in a bad place, some specs were - and yes, it's going to stay that way, there will be no balance changes for classic.
---
The reason is that once you start making changes, where do you stop? There is the fear that if changes were made, we could end up with another version of retail WoW, where every tank/healer/dps can do everything, as they basically all have the same abilities.
---
Personally I think class design was best in BC - it eliminates some of the glaring weaknesses, but still kept each class/spec unique.
---
Not really. It's a bit wacky still but it was in vanilla too and nothing that will actually impair you.
---
because the most important part of this game is forming a community not the gameplay. The community *IS* the product, not necessary the game. Layering pretends the community is an inconsequential side part of the game and just getting everyone online is the most important part. It isn't.
---
Aslong as it's not alliance cities that's fine. For The Alliance!
---
Thanks in part to your explanation, three friends and I are rolling on Grobb. See you there!

I'll try thanks :)

there are no irrelevant classes. there are some specs that are useless in pve, like retribution, subtlety, elemental, balance, arms or whatnot, but those specs on the other hand are good in pvp. good pve specs are also mostly shit for pvp, like fury, arcane, resto shaman and so on.
---
the beauty of it, is that there is always a tradeoff and in the end every class has a place in every part of the game, you just have to be properly spec'd for it.
---
&gt; Given that the servers are virtual... I assume the cost for Blizzard is near zero.
---
You still need hardware of some kind at the bottom layer of that virtulization.  And that hardware costs money.  If you have already have enough hardware to handle this additional load, then you need more licenses for whatever virtualization software you are running, any management software, engines software, ect.  All of those add up quick.
---
Next, you need places to store that data.  Virulization is, *at best* a one-to-one bit conversion for all the data that still needs to be stored for all of those new servers; physical or virtual.  Also, with  that new data, you likely need more cores/servers handling the data queries that will happen.  This means either allocating more existing core or acquiring new cores.  On top of those new cores handling the queries, you might need to pay out more in licenses for your DB software since many are now using a cost-per-core payment model.
---
You, like the person I was responding to, either don't understand what is required to get these servers up and running or don't see the financial side of running those servers.  You view on this is entirely fantastical and unrealistic for a business operation.
---
&gt; Plus, something no one is realising: phase 1 will last MONTHS. That means lots of people will have they’re entire levelling experience from 1-60 with SUBSTANTIAL layering.
---
For the first few days to weeks, I would agree that layering will be something that we will experience and it can have negative outcomes.  However, if the models that Blizz is using to determine the server count is correct, then layering will be an almost non-factor later on as player numbers decrease.  For most players, that means that the majority of their leveling experience will likely have minimal layering since they won't be blitzing to 60.
---
&gt; It flat out is not vanilla.
---
Yes, it isn't Vanilla.  It is Classic; A modern release of the original World of Warcraft.
---
I'm not spamming how it's going to stay forever, I'm criticizing the specific implementation of continent wide layering. 
---
I don't think it will ruin WoW either, but it certainly puts a severe damper on what is otherwise the game I've been more excited about than any other.
---
The video that was posted shows sharding not layering.  You shouldn't be sucked out of a layer and moved into another for walking into orgimmar according to how blizz stated it should work. This is how sharding works on retail.
---
If we got 30,000+ unique responses, I'm guessing that's 10% (300,000 players) at the very highest, and possibly as low as 1% (3,000,000 players). My guess is that Classic will have 500,000 to 2,000,000 players login within the first week, but I have really no idea how many will stick around or if that number would grow after launch rather than peak and drop down.
---
All just spit-balling estimates.
---
Complaining about this is literally free gold and silver farms wtf???
---
Resto shaman does not suck at pvp
---
Top minds.
---
Every spec can raid.  Not every spec can raid in a competitive environment.  Blizzard didn't make weak specs, they made difficult Raids.  
---
And even though I'm defending them here I don't necessarily think that was the smartest decision, but it was their design philosophy at the time and I really commend the old designers for not caving to pressure and making Vanilla easier on a whim. 
---
Sure they could have easily given Paladins a Taunt, reduced mana costs for Boomkins/Spriests/DPS Shamans, or lowered Warrior DPS, and we know that they considered those changes because they were mostly implemented immediately after the release of Burning Crusade, but their vision of Vanilla WoW was very narrow.  They saw that it worked and they were happy not to fuck with it.
---
Wait, he's kidding, right? I thought this guy had a genuine passion for the game and community...? I don't know too much about him, though.
---
Yeah, most food sells for shit to vendors, and uncooked fish sell for less than cooked fish. However, people will buy raw fish to level cooking and/or for recipes. If you can sell it, and the AH isn't saturated with 'em, do so.
---
If your faction is really tiny the AH can be really lackluster too for both buying and selling. That was one of the biggest reasons I transferred off my old realm (which was high pop but like 9A:1H and I was horde). It also sucked to have super long queues despite your faction being nearly non-existent.
---
It really doesn't help that there are enough people in the world that say "Lol I am just pretending" only to be real assholes/douchebags.
---
Take the Doctor for example. He pretends to be an asshole on stream but is supposed to be a "nice guy" outside of this persona.
---
Nice guys don't cheat on their wife.
---
This is a simple zone switch, it actually existed back then too. You ppl need to relax.
---
I advise doubling down on the healthy living and not playing this game.
---
Honestly, he spoke very well and I understand the use. I don't want to be sitting in a mine farming goldust for 10 hours. Sharding will fix that from my understanding.   
---
If we could get confirmation that it will be removed withing the first 4 weeks, i think we could be content with that, no?
---
Sounds like unique servers
---
Well I couldn't find it linked elsewhere, but with max ground clutter basically the shores of the lakes of Mulgore are sectioned off with grass in clear angled blocks. Clearly a visual bug and easily fixed.
---
It literally is griefing to do that, just because its less intrusive doesnt mean it isnt griefing to go around one shotting level 10s as a maxed level character
---
Someone need to ask Blizzard about this and get some clear cut answers. NOW. Fansites / influencers / journalists, do your fucking job!
---
It's the same people who would complain "there's too many servers and the population is spread out" or "my server is dead" or "this server merge is the worst thing in human history".
---
I find it hilarious at this point, I just feel bad for whoever actually HAS to read all this stuff
---
cite your source, plz
---
Yes we needed more opinions on layering.
---
Nobody gives a shit what you think, quit posting.
---
Really digging this art.
---
This is actually a perfect idea. Disable the layering in major cities and towns, so that we actually feel like we are returning to populated areas when we aren’t questing. I understand the need for layering out in the world, but major cities need to feel like major cities. Players everywhere, going to and from places, talking, trading, etc. Layering would do nothing but further divide the player base where it matters most that there is unity. I hope blizzard sees and implements this.
---
Oh please, I used to raid and arena with a Mage from Singapore with 1000 ping, and it didnt stop him from hitting top 10 on world of logs during progression nights in raids. Or us hitting 2k+ in arena.
---
They take out layering anyway because it is 100% incompatible with world raid bosses. I assume if it's too crowded they'll open new realms with free transfers from affected realms. Those types of transfers are much easier than merging established realms.
---
Notice he is in a group already, as has all of the clips I've seen of this bug. I bet it has something to do with trying to revert back to this character's home layer, which is different from the group leader's layer.
---
That's my point. It seems to not be working as intended, or they lied.
---
That’s not what was said.  They said CRZ will not be available in the Mist of Panderia content.  You’re twisting that into meaning “it will never be turned on in current content, ever.”
---
They have made this crystal clear that layering is a temporary thing.  If you don’t want to believe that, then that’s on you.
---
That could be, and I could see how it would work but I think that layering is going to be in the game for such a short while that creating a completely new infrastructure like that would just be a waste of time, sure "layering" is new, but it got it's base from sharding I would assume.  
---
Imo people are just turning it into a bigger deal than it is, likely it won't last more than a month (no source just my opinion) and think about how fast a month goes by when you play this game, before you even realized it, it would be gone.   
---
But that's just my 2 cents
---
That makes no sense, Korea is 30k km away from Chicago.
---
I played hardcore on nostalrius and only recall "unplayable lag" on about two nights.
---
Im a big fan of Rich's videos but that clip he ganks them while they are trying to 2man some level50 mobs,both of them have zero mana and around 50% hp. They weren't going to win that
---
I mean honestly I fully expect many players whose favorite expansion was burning Crusade will also be playing this classic, under the assumption that these will progress through expansions. It's that age-old debate, would blizzard really have servers at the end of their current content and leave them there for all eternity? Or what happens to the characters we are going to play when they reach the end of classic?
---
Many people find no joy in flying because of how many times they have had to relearn it over expansions. But after 15 months or more of being on the ground, many people will once again feel like flight is something new and interesting they want to experience for these characters they've played.
---
That's true but I have 0 interest in RP aside from a little headcanon for my toon. I don't wanna be a buzzkill or anything like that. And even if it was cool, if there was a lot of RP going on and I'm just being me it could be weird.
---
I think the PvE and RP stress realms may be hosted in LA. My ping from WA state was 48 to those servers, but 71 to the PvP server. Could be wrong though.
---
"Conspiracy theory" is not an argument, it's literally a coined phrase by the CIA to dissuade thinkers from questioning JFK's assassination. And here you are all these decades later, throwing that little bomb at me without any thought to its origins. 
---
I'm not claiming my hypothesis as fact, it's just a suspicion, which is a good thing to have. Otherwise you'll naively lap up whatever people in authority tell you is the truth.
---
This really shouldn't be on here.
---
This whole sub has lost it's damn mind.
---
This is exactly what was said, people like to twist what blizzard said a lot...
---
"...stream sniping while I have double your gear."
---
lol'd. Gonna be hard to get gear if you're griefed any time you leave your capital because people hate you. A streamer's blacklist is worthless to a community that doesn't care.
---
Naked, weapon only
---
It's a fair assumption. The devs are not going to be tweaking layering for performance. They're going to tweaking it so that layering is actively being used so that any bugs that have not yet been found are.
---
It's a fucking stress test. They're doing tests. Everyone needs to stop being so reactionary. What we're playing is a test, not the real thing.
---
ok crazy
---
You acknowledge that it’s been ‘beaten like a dead horse’ but then ask the same exact question that’s been asked 10,000 times already?  If you know it’s the proverbial beating of the dead horse, then clearly you already know what the answers are going to be.
---
What makes you think it’ll be a major change? This bug could be as simple as tweaking the logic that decides when to switch the player to a new “layer”. Could literally be as simple as a few lines of code. But I’m guessing.
---
Yeah I totally agree, I’m sure by the time the population has spread out enough it will be removed. Surely before phase 2 as well. If it was hanging around then something like this might work.
---
Nostalrius' population never got in my way and only made the world feel more alive.
---
The fact that streamers are a thing blows my mind. If you spend your time and money for some privileged millionaire man-baby to play video games while you watch - you’re an absolutely irredeemable failure in every aspect of human life, zero exceptions.
---
Dad to a 1 year old. Going for pvp Alliance on Whitemane with some old friends looking to join more.
---
Many players won't be able to get the name they want, being a streamer shouldn't make you above that, it's not that someone may want the name Esfand, it's that nobody should be above others when it comes to getting a chance to reserve their wanted name.
---
This one is good, not as good as Kokgag, but atill good.
---
The fact that you keep delaying is not helping, ooh its jus"alpha" ooh its just "beta"ooh its only "phase 1" ...
---
Yup. This is a trainwreck right now and the silence from Blizzard about it this close to release is just awful.
---
Your "end of discussion" supports abusing people, for playing a game in a manner you dislike. 
---
mine supports playing a video game and being decent human beings. 
---
Have a blessed life, sweetie.
---
The Classic section of WoWhead is remarkably similar to WoWhead.
---
Is there a way to show item tooltip comparisons without always having to hold down the shift key?
---
People see a couple gifs (from a beta, no less) and then cry the end of the world.
---
Dude, did you not read my post? I literally said, "im not saying make every class special" just viable.
---
Seriously... Go play second life or something. Wow is a game with combat mechanics... Using it as paragraph simulator and expecting everyone around you to follow "rules" is a bit silly...
---
this has nothing to do with a strawman, don't just throw jargon out.
---
And no it objectively doesn't. Having a larger pool of people inherently reduces your chance of repeat interactions.
---
Lets say a server has 30,000 people. It is layered so that all these people can log in, but are on 15 layers. My chance of repeat interactions are literally 15x lower. Lets say this server inevitably dwindles down to about 5000 people in 4 months. I will still have been in that large player soup having majorly reduced chance of repeat interactions (slowly increasing over time) as the total pool of layers is still high.
---
If there are instead 15 servers. Yes the population will dwindle over time, but for that entire period I will have been consistently interacting with the same reduced pool of players. I will undoubtedly be more well acquainted and integrated into the community. As each server dwindles they can just merge them. Start with an even number and merge with their sister realm, then merge again. Maybe ending at 3 realms housing the 5000 players. Except I will have had much more interaction time with each batch of players.
---
Layering is essentially the equivalent (as they describe it) of having those 15 servers, but you are just randomly assigned to different ones depending on the need. So instead of being locked with one group, you are simultaneously playing on 15 different servers and wondering why you never seem to recognize people.
---
Lol he didn’t lie they weren’t even deadset on if they wanted to use sharding at all at that point they just said that’s what they were thinking about doing.
---
Can you show me where they posted exactly how they’re going to use layering and in what capacity on launch day?
---
Four servers with non-overlapping names, if the population drops below a certain amount during peak hours, four becomes two. If the population of the two drops below again two becomes one. Simple.
---
Advantages: No layering, no abuse, no glitches, other people to play the game with.
---
Disadvantages: Can't recruit from entire server to your guild from day one. If you don't research you may be on a streamer server and not know it.
---
I’m just happy Classic is 1.12. Every other MMO has done a legacy/vanilla server already and they don’t change a thing. It’s just the live game with expansions locked. WoW players nitpicking over logistical issues when they’ve gotten so much love in the form of classic.
---
Also not an argument.
---
I am sorry but there is only one compliment to a warrior in a 2 man group.  Its the druid.  Hate me if you will but there are many reasons to this.  Stealth Pulls,  Hots that allow side dps, Big heals, Dots that allow side dps while healing, Thorns, Battle Rez with his tuant, Bear taunt to buy time for heals, Root CC, buffs that compliment each other,  Cat form while he has agro, Stealth mechanics he cant perform, etc etc. 
---
If you plan to do a 2 man group, warrior druid is basically the apex of compatibility.
---
the highlight is cause it says 420 guys fat clouds
---
Aren't they the same subscription?
---
eu welfare guild
---
 Yeah, nah is Kiwi slang. 
---
Fucking Australians.
---
&gt;or if I had just never taken the time to read the quests, but you're actually fighting the Lich King's army of brain-dead undead. 
---
Yeah dude, you should really be reading quest text. The Forsaken are the undead that were broken free from the Lich King's control when Illidan tried to destroy the Frozen Throne, the rest of the undead in all of Lordaeron are still under LK's control.
---
oh, i didn't know this was a structured debate. Am I not gonna make it to nationals now?
---
This old fucking record.
---
Great duo!
---
Imagine being a grown ass man and reporting someone in a video game for something other than hacking/gold selling.
---
Lmfao no it doesnt
---
I beg to differ. You choose a class and within that class you play a spec. Its impossible to play a class without choosing a spec. But i get your point. Im not saying make everyone happy, but if you have classes people cant even play because they arent relevant what is the point? Did you read my entire post? I covered this.
---
Then play on a private server nobody cares
---
You sharded your pants didnt you
---
Feel better?
---
For leveling I'd say deep frost has the most to offer, especially on a PvP server. In PvE raids it depends on the specs of other mages in the raid. If you already have someone with the winter's chill talent, then that allows other mages to go for arcane power if they want to minmax.
---
Personally, I'm probably going to stay deep frost PvP spec for the first few phases if I can get away with it.
---
I see this point made a lot, but the difference is no one is going to be a troll and log in and get the name Kinkblots before you but streamers will have a bunch of assholes trying to do just that, I am not a streamer and I think they should let them have their names.
---
What is he even talking about in that clip? I genuinely don't get it. He says he ganks level 15s off stream until they log off, because he is an asshole - then he says that "this is different" and then the whole "extreme example" thing. Does he mean he wants people that ganked him punished? As an example? Why is it different? I don't understand
---
Most of my way to 20 was just having thorns on. Open with moonfire + wrath, bear form auto attack and maul. Occasionally have to drop a healing touch. Demoralizing roar helps too.
---
Yea I got the same thing
---
I didn't know what glow they're referring to either, which led to me finding [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcT9BwzJ4G4) on YouTube solely demonstrating the effect. I copied stills from the video to produce [this side-by-side comparison](https://imgur.com/YKynrz8.png).
---
That picture means nothing. Competition for mobs was pretty intense in the first zone and I didn't even start until Saturday
---
Yes you can and no it's not. Instead of 13 servers, make a bunch and then merge them as needed. There is no point in making a faithful recreation of vanilla all the way down to spell batching, then decide that it won't be faithful with regards to essentially the biggest factor in the entire game. a persistent community.
---
don't think the size matters at all, it's just that blizzard believes 90% of players will quit after a month
---
I just want to find a good guild, make some new friends and have some fun experiences.  It’s already going to be hard enough to do all that shit with layering and 30k + damn people on each server, but to have to contend with thousands of zealot cultists and their shrill jackass messiahs is just icing on the damn cake.  I don’t know jack about these streamers and I don’t really care if they are really nice people when they don’t have an army of muppets following them around, because they do have an army of muppets, and their brands seem to be cause as much drama and problems around them as they can all for the views.  So why shouldn’t I have a hate boner for each and every of them?
---
Would it work?
---
My guild has been raiding together for months
---
Only when you stop replying
---
Bemoaning missing out on potential organic interactions.
---
There is no authentication vanilla experience. There is your vanilla experience. And that is what you make it.
---
o im still gonna play, its so weird that this silly game is motivating me so much.
---
I can't fathom why people care so much about that dude, or anyone who streams 
---
This just seems obsessive and stupid
---
This is expected behaviour tho right? It’s still beta - on launch we get layering I believe (but not before)
---
And here you are taking your time to comment
---
That's fair, but I did some research and the average ping going from Singapore to Sydney is about 60ms lower than to any US city, so there must be some level of decent cable infrastructure to Australia as well
---
Your missing thr point those people arent doing it to fuck with you. If you have a cool popular pun idea dor your name as an example there are probably a number of other players who have the same idea. But they all want the name for that reason. These streamers names are tied to them and people trying to take them are trying just to fuck with them. 
---
It's not really royalty at all, I'm not rolling on their server and I think they should get their names it's better for blizzard and classic wow of they do. They promote the game we get more people to play with.
---
Woah cool! Hey that makes happy. Good luck to you all :)
---
Most streamers won’t be playing classic in 2-3 months.
---
Hi, hope you don't mind me asking, but why did you go with warlock? I'm trying to decide what class to play: between a priest, mage, or warlock. And I've been thinking, if this were WotLK, I'd be an affliction lock, since I love the drains, DoTs, and survivability. But in Vanilla (which I've never played before), affliction doesn't seem to be about that—it's more about supporting your DPS through curses. So I'm not sure whether they'd be a good fit. Thanks!
---
A million times YES!
---
It's temporary, get triggered much ?
---
Respect man. Thanks for not being a dick for starters. I get it, I just disagree with it. I think its fine if one class does way better in a role like tank with warriors leading and paladins being behind. But it gets frustrating when the warriors are very up front and prots have such a large gap behind the warriors. It shouldnt be that big. I really agree at blizzards concept of making some classes clearly better, but not THAT much better. Literally anything, like the smallest buff ever and Id be fine. But there are clearly these large gaps between specs for certain roles you know? Ill accept it and play through it but its really frustrating. And even bliz knows its a problem but they are afraid if they change one single thing that the vanilla fuckheads will complain and write it on their gravestone.
---
This video is such a pointless exaggeration. If you quit cause you didn't get your name from 2005 you didn't want to play in the first place. 
---
Everyone on retail is playing some amalgamation of something like their name and class at this point. How is it 2019 and people still expect to get the exact username they desire anywhere on the internet. 
---
The point of so few servers is to be careful and not have dead servers. The end result of making 100 servers like the video suggests is CRZ and LFD being necessary to do things. 
---
That is way worse than not getting your name cause there weren't 100 servers.
---
Couldnt shaman pad their numbers by the amount of multi target dps they can achieve during a raid with CL or is it 1 mob per fight?
---
Don't the Forsaken typically forget much of their former lives? Being alive, being killed, then resurrected and mind-controlled by Arthas, then being wrested from his control and returned to free will is such a convoluted series of psychological trauma that it's a wonder that they function at all (see: the endless Mindless Undead that don't make it).
---
Brazilians on Thalnos
---
Spanish speaking on Faerlina
---
People avoid Brazilians like the plague not because of the language barrier, but rather because they are cancerous to play with. The Spanish speaking (Mostly Mexico) I’ve never had an issue with and I came from an unofficial Spanish server in Vanilla.
---
I saw them as a golden company back in the day. My favorite pc game of all time is diablo 2.
---
That's exactly the issue I was talking about.  Sorry if that wasnt clear.
---
Ah yer a fookin coont
---
That’s a fun layer
---
I fully support camping streamers, but I've got better things to do with my time, and  a twilight guild name?
---
Lame.
---
yOu ThInK YoU dO
---
Actually I had to do that and clip under Stormwind to get here!
---
Haha, yep. Mana mis-management killed me a few times over the stress test. Loved it.
---
It doesn’t matter because Blizzard ruined classic for all of us by implementing sharding
---
Oh we just went there
---
I mean this is honestly the best solution to streamers. Build communities that don't care what the streamers think I. The only thing that gives streamers power is following their leads.
---
this is only possible with homogenization of the classes and this inevitably kills uniqueness, you get shit like in retail or lol where ever class/champ has to have certain abilities to be viable. this is not good game design.
---
Why are they taking screenshots in IF on a 1day stress test though?  Why do they expect people to be in town instead of out fucking about?
---
The True Classic Experience
---
Man i would hate to be the guy who gets "layered" out this fight.
---
In vanilla Stormwind was never a major hub, Ironforge was. It doesn't surprise me that even with layering you won't see many people hanging out in SW in classic.
---
The amount of shitposting on the OCE stress test server was insane, beware.
---
Yeah, it's been nice to have a dry run, but I really only went to IF and SW to get a feel for the layout since I was only ever Horde pre-Cata
---
Why play on a private server first and then Classic?
---
Honestly the people spamming the sub with complaints about sharding is making me not want to even bother with Classic. It's not 100% going to be the same. You aren't younger, most of your friends aren't coming back, and that doesn't mean this experience can't be new, fun, and exciting.
---
In a year we can all be laughing about that one time you got sharded out of an auction house, or the game can be dead because people spent the entire time being negative nancies instead of being stoked to have meaningful class identities again.
---
Whether it's to troll or if people really want those names makes no difference, they should all have the opportunity to choose the name they want for whatever reason, they promote the game but at the same time completely ruin whatever server they're going to play on, not a net positive imo and should not be treated as such by giving the special treatment.
---
I posted something similar in another thread, but I believe layering is the first piece of the puzzle. Essentially, people will inevitably cry out for BC expansion, then WOTLK, etc.
---
I think Blizzard plan to have just a handful of servers, but each server allows people to create a character inside a specific expansion, which they can only play with others of the same expansion.
---
This prevents servers dying or going to waste if people get bored with classic, and potentially prevents them from moving to a BC/Wrath/etc private server.
---
So I think this whole "new infrastructure" is exactly that. A way to use 1 server to host all expansions and release them as they are (re)developed, but allow players to choose what version they play on.
---
It's still just phase 1.
---
Once it's Phase 2 there will be no layering. That's pretty specific. There's a distinct cutoff.
---
I like how you think. :)
---
He could stream with a 1 minute delay or something
---
I can't believe I have to pick a character and a server in like 24 hours. I am not prepared at all. This decision could affect the next 6 months-2 years of my at home free time....
---
 
---
One thing I can say is I won't reroll. What I pick is what I'll stay with
---
same man, that changed the way i thought of games. that, starcraft, and original wow.
---
authentic blizzard launch was me staring at my computer because I couldn't get into the game
---
They’ve said a variety of things. Part of the chaos now is a result of not knowing what their plans are or how they intend for it to work.
---
Enjoying your character is important and simply being a priest is the most important part, you will not have any difficulty finding some group who wants you for any type of content.
---
Unrelated question: What addon is that I keep seeing PvPers use that scrolls the abilities being used on the screen?
---
I welcome Jussi, Lasse, Jari, Timo, Mikku, and Magnus Odinsson to my raid group with open arms.
---
Seems pretty relevant when one side is crying about censorship but that side actually censors more.
---
The thing about profanity "censorship" is it's a filter an optional censorship.  Where I highly doubt you can opt out of the Australian censorship in those videogames.
---
maybe we need more than 3 server? retail NA has 240 just saying...
---
Someone who played Paladin for 3 years in Vanilla, take my advice or be doomed to suffer the same disappointing fate that I did..,
---
Paladins can not tank at level 60.
---
How would you go about this?
---
You would have to have a low level character (that you can play without a sub) with enough gold on them to buy the token?
---
It's not sharding...
---
Don’t use OSRS if you don’t know what you are talking about. OSRS had the same decay in the player base for years until they started adding a ton of new content.
---
Its Asmongold
---
Nuff said
---
Nice downvotes :)
---
You can use WeakAuras for range check. It doesn’t change your actual bars, but can give you a range notifier of a red icon when out of range.
---
It’s already been proven that Blizzard lied about layering
---
For many diehard MMO players, WoW Classic is just the waiting room for Pantheon:
---

---
haha
---
at least 50 servers at launch + queue time.
---
I just fixed classic
---
And one priest, shaman or paladin can rez you just as easily.
---
On his phace.
---
Unpopular opinion: he doesn't owe anyone a thing.
---
Being okay with acting that way because it benefits you is just the definition of being a terrible person.  You have no self standards and will either pretend be a dick or just straight up be a dick because it makes you more money than being a positive force in the community.
---
They're just trash shills.
---
THE HERO WE NEED
---
No, that's layering malfunctioning. Sharding doesn't exist in classic wow
---
The question I have is where is the line? Twitch partnership? What about YouTube content creators? Should anyone who's monitized have early name reserve? What about just major streamers that have sponsor deals but aren't normally known for playing WoW? 
---
Also, I think if streamers DO want this special priveledge, they have to also announce what server they are playing on via Twitter or some sort of varifiable avenue. What if Blizzard determined the "streamer server" so people know that the streamers names are reserved on that server so if they do want to reserve a name like "Esfand" they can just do so on another server?
---
But calling on a mob to camp you the second they find you could be considered griefing... especially with video evidence of him shit talking on stream about how everyone should go after a single person.
---
Done.
---
I was a big fan when he was uploading YouTube videos, where he was keeping it real and had some great content most of the time. Then he switched over to Streaming on Twitch and I lost that "connection" to him, because it all felt like a big act. YouTube Asmongold and Twitch Asmongold are not the same person, or at least they appear not to be. How he grew this much on Twitch I will never know!
---
Getting pissed off because you can't tag a mob to finish a quest isn't fun.
---
But they could probably knock out all 5 man content right?
---
Nah I get that, lol ima cowboy fan so I understand hate an being hated, but idk I just hope we can all, very similar to the nfl, have teams but at the end of the day we’re civil. I for sure get both sides though, really hoping it sorts itself out
---
&gt;Not using bagnon
---
Thanks for some reassurance, I considered playing a fire Mage in classic just so I could actually do some damage if this was true.

"gimmick my way to a layer" = "invite plz"
---
It's literally just grouping, which is what everyone does anyway to find someone they are going to trade with.
---
&gt; sharding 
---
You based that entire paragraph on something that isn't in classic. Y I K E S
---
&gt; Vanilla as it was didn't have people phasing in and out of your game world.
---
This isn't what layering is, its what sharding is, the thing you are conflating with layering. 
---
This is what happens when you call things you don't understand jargon. The boomer is real in you.
---
Worth noting, the Hinterlands quests were included in the beta.
---
How do you know?
---
I guess I just disagree with you on some things. I think its ridiculous that the only viable tank for raiding is a warrior. Why make other tank specs if they arent even as close to as good. Im not saying just as good, even just below the warrior, but like I said its not even close.
---
I think its a great idea, so if he were to ever stop streaming there wont be a mass flux of watchers of leaving the server. Why do you care so much?
---
Good times, lotta time wasted when I was younger just swimming around the continent looking for stuff like this.
---
This comment made my day.
---
Would I be viable in battlegrounds as a shadow priest? I’ll most likely be playing alone until I make some friends. Also, I read that shadow priests are essentially almost always out of mama during fights and that it gets frustrating after a while
---
basically it can only be a success if it's not successful.
---
Yeah that's mainly on the streamers, they're responsible for whatever mob mentality they use for their personal gain
---
I do kinda wish I was European in this regard cause I like all of the content creators over there lol
---
I thought you had to buy tokens from the AH. No?
---
Where on the login screen can you buy game tokens with gold?
---
Paladins are fantastic healers if you want to play Holy. Ret is considered a bottom tier DPS spec so paladins are most commonly going the healer route. They’re also one of the best PvP classes and arguably the best PvP healer.
---
Druids are versatile but not amazing at any one thing. They’re still necessary and offer decent healing and good utility in raids, so this is most commonly another healing class (resto spec). You can also tank while leveling and tank dungeons at max level in bear form if you go feral.
---
Warrior is the best tank in the game so you can go protection and learn how to tank for easy invites to groups and raids, or you can go the DPS route and still find groups as they are good damage dealers in raids/dungeons/PvP.
---
This
---
There’s a pretty deep cave next to that area too if I recall, I don’t remember seeing anything in there though
---
im just glad I got to experience vanilla back in 2005. I still remember getting those epic rogue shoulders from that troll island in stv after turning in some tokens shit. Good times.
---
This means nothing. Blizzard can ONLY remove layering after the populations decrease, if the servers stay packed they will be unable to remove it. This isn't a "we have to build new technology to be able to remove layering" its "We know this is going to fail and 95% of the players will leave after X months and we'll then be able to remove layering".
---
Don't like him or anything he has to say. Saw a stream once and it was a complain fest about how streamers got it rough and just want to play. I couldn't even follow what he was saying, because like, ya know like, and like anyway, so like.... Yeah... Like fuck... 
---
Great we get it. You want all the perks, but none of the cons. It's called entitlement and self importance. We'll see how "chill" they are when they demand raid drops handed to them by their fanatical followers.
---
And if it does, you're not the kind of person that needs to be playing Classic anyway, sitting around crying about every little thing under the sun wanting it changed...
---
You should go watch some of Richturpin's videos on YouTube. Hilarious seeing these streamers trying to find the report button as soon as they get ganked.
---
Sleep: Aspect of the bear.

Just played the stress test on my i5, 8gb RAM, and 512gb 2018 touchbar... Game ran great at 60fps. However I just reread your comment about changing the resolution to a lower setting. I have been playing w. retina on getting those frames. Which standard resolution would you recommend setting the display to for playing classic wow?
---
I love helping newbies and usually go out of my way in game to help them. Classic is all about community! ^_^
---
Nah I got banned for a week in burning crusade for saying "fuck" once in general chat. It wasn't even a "fuck you" targeted at anyone or anything.
---
I tried appealing it making that exact common sense argument - "the mature chat filter is enabled by default when you install the game, this means that in order to see what I wrote in chat you would have had to disable it, thus consenting to see mature language"
---
The response I got was basically "too bad, you're still banned"
---
Warriors are the most gear dependent class by far.  Geared you're totally OP at the best tank and capable of moving the damage meters when not tanking.
---
That said as a warrior you will absolutely be expected to tank every 5man when leveling up.  Yes even if you put every point into the fury tree.
---
Hunter and shadow priest are both good solo classes.
---
EPIC !
---
You mean McConnell "get banned in pubg for legitimately breaking the rules and getting his streamer friends to pull their streamer priveledge to get him unbanned" ret?
---
Lmao
---
I disagree, they went overkill with balancing in current expansions. Im not saying that. Im saying micro micro micro fucking changes that at least give players the opportunity to play specs in stuff they want to play in. If there is a tank spec for pally, that spec should be able to play all of the content. Not just certain parts. Then it really isnt a tank is it? Same with other specs that cant participate in all game modes, its only good for one thing? Okay then nobody is going to roll that shit.
---
thalnos apparently is off the table. But also apparently is the “designated Brazilian server”...yet census demographics say only about 6% are portugese speakers
---
FWIW: Prot/Holy leveling is not poor at later stages. Pretty strong aoe farming, especially in EPL/WPL.
---
Yeah the twitch app really spoiled me from retail. I had that shit on auto update, install, sync, on multiple PCs without having to do a single thing. Hopefully classic gets the same treatment soon.
---
Right now everyone is waiting for these entitled streamers to announce which server they will be rolling so everyone can avoid it and let them have the whole server to themselves.
---
What I propose is to say "fuck that" and have everyone roll on whichever server they want.
---
If streamers show up on your server and try to ruin it with their shitty fan-bases, return the favor by stream sniping and camping the crap out of them.
---
Make camping streamer a fun server event. Work together as a server community to keep these streamer from ruining your server.
---
Yes. Mana will be an issue during longer raid fights. Won’t be an issue in dungeons with water/mana pots.
---
Yeah 'full country' is a bit disingenuous when in reality the entire oce region probably has a smaller playerbase than say, germany and their server
---
avoidstreamers.com
---
Short answer - no, not yet.
---
Just wanna add that i was in a group of about 35 people that was trying for over an hour to meet up and assist these people but we never were able to get on the same layer. super frustrating.
---
That feeling to me is the lack of significance. When someone walks by you and they switch layers, that player no longer has an impact on you, and vice versa. Dust in the wind, he's gone. Maybe you'll see him again, maybe you won't. That player ceases to be a part of your world unless you make him through chatting or inviting him to a party. Vanilla is great because you can recognize players. Meet someone in Westfall at lvl 12? Three days later you're there doing Deadmines together. Maybe next week you join their group to kill Elites in Redridge. Both players have grown their characters and you've seen it happen in real time.
---
I'm preaching to the choir, and not in a very eloquent manner, but the point is - to me, every player makes up a portion of that server. When you see someone disappearing you know that they can't see you either, and there's something to be said about being seen. Leaving your own personal imprint on the world feels great. Knowing you're just an interchangeable asset to their current playsession shatters any and all immersion.
---
Any idea if RealMobHealth is integrated?
---
They said they won't be on Thalnos or Whitemane, any other pvp server is possible atm
---
No, but they've stated that Fairbanks and Thalnos aren't being looked at. So to avoid big streamers, roll there.
---
The thumbnail is really dumb... You're really going to compare the population of IF on an invite only low pop beta server to the day Nostalrius was shut down as a way of showing the effect of layering? So stupid...
---
And somehow the phrase "final stress test" means nothing to you.
---
If any1 wants to compare or is running similar specs- i am getting steady 50-60 fps on graphics settings “3” with following laptop from 2012- intel core 2 duo (3rd gen), geforce GT540m 1 gb, ssd, 8 gb ram and win 10 64 bit.
---
Like I said before, whatever you have to tell yourself. I see sharding in classic wow. There is video evidence that it is acting like sharding. If it smells like sharding, acts like sharding, talks like sharding, then it's probably sharding.  It doesn't matter that you're calling it by a different name if the end result of the tech is giving you sharding. If they were completely different systems then why are we having sharding issues that are acting exactly like, idk, sharding acts in retail?
---
Lol confirmed. Nothings confirmed until you see them playing on a realm in two weeks.
---
Yell and complain to their fans/blizz, blame stream snipers
---
It's going to be like that for a couple of weeks.... Relax, I don't think people realize how bad the drop rate is for a lot of quests and there's no mob tag sharing. If there was no layering it would be thousands of people in your area trying to tag one mob that spawns every 3 to 4 minutes. The drop rate on things is like one every five kills. It would take you 10 hours to hit level 6 that's not fun for anyone.
---
The irony of this statement makes me smile.
---
Yes and for good reason. It kinda sucks ass.
---
Ya epic raid.
---
Because tanks are needed for more than just raids?
---
what if there was a 10 minute wait timer to switch channels?
---
If it takes you more than 30 minutes to get ganked, you aren't trying hard enough.
---
You can buy a token off the AH and choose to use it as either 30 days of game time or $15 battle.net balance. But you can also just directly activate game time from the character screen if you do not have a current subscription ([here is a youtube video showing that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd-TVWjVxAE))
---
This was the most fun I have had on WoW in years haha! I was on the horde during this exact exchange and we were all dying in discord so funny. GG boys
---
Yes! 
---
The warrior dps rotation is pretty engaging by vanilla standards, because your just smashing keys the whole time. It's not difficult, you get big cooldowns to pair with rage pots so you can go all out on the meters. Its alot of fun, I did multiple raids for the first time on the last vanilla private server I played as a warrior, and it was a blast. It was the first time I played a warrior, and I was top 3 dps on many of the boss fights in my first ZG run. I'm maining one in classic.
---
it does, but fresh subs are the lifeblood of WoW, they facilitate its ongoing monetisation, from blizz perspective if they get even 1 in 10 classic players to try retail and maybe buy something from the shop, or other items/games from the blizzard store (WC3 reforged? More people on client = more going back to overwatch?) that’s a win
---
And cmon, the tens of millions (at minimum) they’ll make monthly off of classic subscriptions won’t be insignificant
---
classic will be in the billion dollar range as a  revenue generator over its lifetime, probably deserves at least a mention on earnings
---
What you're proposing is a very elegant solution but there's still the problem of optics: Blizzard as a company probably doesn't like the optics of servers merging. Layering hides it.
---
I answered his question. You tell him that, if you're so inclined. I have little faith the real release will be substantially better.
---
im in imagine a fancy streamer, minding his own business when an entire 40 man raid descends upon him, corpse camping until he stops streaming or logs off.  VICTORY
---
Dude, theres so much random info online regarding dps in classic i read a guide saying it was an S tier class for pve dps.
---
its 1 Hour
---
very carefully
---
good, ill just be waiting at the second servers launch and name my randomly generated appearance character "esfand" on all 3 pvp-east servers
---
I mean if that's more fun to you than leveling up and playing the game to enjoy it.
---
Fair enough, I stand corrected then, only story I’ve ever heard of it dropping was from mc trash
---
To be fair, no one has to be in their guild or raid with them. People choose to be in his guild knowing that that's a possibility or even a probability.
---
Well shit. That makes the wand grind a little more complicated
---
That screenshot is so not true.
---
when will they make it so you can take off the white filter? That was an option in vanilla.
---
i do agree that if he does actually mess with the server in a negative way, but i also think that there’s some nuance to him saying that. i’ve watched him for a while to see what all the fuss is about and i think i can kinda tell when he’s just saying things for reddit classic hyperboys to get mad at, and when he’s just being sarcastic. i think this was more on the sarcastic. and even if it was serious, then i don’t think anything should happen until he actually does things
---
Questing add-ons should speed things up.
---
Melee WITH a pet. I think that’d be really cool!
---
That's all my little sister plays, and she couldn't be more excited for Classic. That said, I'm surprised it is so rare.
---
 &gt;  This is supposed to be a faithful recreation of vanilla.
---
No it isn't.  It is "as close to the Vanilla experience as we can get on a new engine, with new tech, with Bnet integration, with..."
---
You aren't getting "exactly Vanilla".  No one can give you that, not even pservers.  You're getting "pretty fucking good".
---
Lol 8000 people on Herod. Try 80k week 1.
---
I have worse cpu than you and its running fine on 50-60 fps on my old laptop on graphics settings preset “3” (Classic- the lowest settings is preset 1) so dont’t worry. Make sure Your nvidia drivers are up to date - I was getting some 3d accelerator error when trying to log in before my drivers were updated. My gpu is 540M
---
I disagree they have perma banned streamers before. Reckful being the prime example.
---
That idea makes no sense to me... How is putting 4 layers in a city of 100 people any different than splitting 100 people into 4 mirror image cities? The result is the same, dead cities. There were times in both the stress test and beta that areas looked packed and it's known that they're purposefully lowering the layering #s. Chill.
---
No, not only on this subreddit.
---
Bear tanks are fine.  Boomkins and kitty cats are considered meme specs at 60.
---
Level 5 is when you can learn. Most of the secondary starting areas have certain trainers there. It's handy to get them as soon as you hit 5 and usually worth the trip then just hearth back
---
Every soul shard
---
Fire mage is basically unplayable in PvE the first half of classic lol.
---
Warrior is top tier in dps for both pve and pvp. You dont have to tank. Bgs are inherently a team event. With healers warriors are insanely strong
---
So to make your first green in tailoring you need 30 skill.  Linen bolts are orange until 25 skill so 48 linen will get you that far.  If you’re lucky you can make 10 more bolts and get to 30 or you can consume 5 of your 24 bolts making orange skill up tailoring items.  That leaves you with 6-8 robes you can make that you can disenchant.  You need 2 lesser magic essence for the rod and then the wand so it’s rolling dice, but decent odds.
---
Alternatively there is a limited supply Magic essence at the enchanter supply (good luck).
---
Also you might get some green drops you don’t need and get lucky.  Just remember you need 10 enchanting skill for the wand so you need some bulk disenchanting or strange dust enchants to get there.
---
Man, I thought Tarpit was good
---
Wait, you honestly think there is a significant difference between "layering" and "sharding". That's just astroturfing to kill the bad PR sharding has from BfA. Can't tell if you're a shill or an idiot. Also deflecting from the core argument by trying to redirect the entire discussion to be about some nit-pick is essentially an omission of defeat in any circle of people who don't consider flinging poop to be a valid form of discourse.
---
I learned to stop gargling blizzard's nuts when they peddled nothing but lies, astroturfing, and terrible decision making in Diablo 3. I assume you're probably just pretty new and haven't lost faith yet. Your childish antics and naivete are honestly kind of cute.
---
I have a 5-button mouse, so only 2 buttons besides left right and scroll. I like to use those for camera/aim control so I use the other 2 for auto run and whatever interrupt spell my class has
---
They have some of the fastest internet speeds in the world.
---
I guess I'm wrong, for some reason I remember alliance in Barrens are red and horde showed up to them as yellow
---
Hey, I’m leaning toward Whitemane too, but I have no idea what 4-chan leaning to Whitemane means, can you give me an explanation?
---
Thanks for the info btw!
---
Considering that "streamers" are going to have legions of hundreds of people around them, you'd need a REALLY big guild to relentlessly gank a streamer.
---
You think 5% is optimistic? I would have thought that it's ridiculously conservative.
---
At the height of Wrath, WOW had over 12 million subs concurrently worldwide.  
---
I guess we'll know in 2 weeks if there are queues 50,000 places long
---
It's funny that I think its dumb to make a community more toxic and the  I'm advocating against people making it more toxic????? What are you on about? Streamers getting their toon name doesnt make the community any more or less toxic. People constantly complain posting and whining about it does. 
---
I'm not even arguing on their behalf. I just dont want this community to turn into the old private server community which was toxic as shit.
---
I used to play a female tauren hunter in vanilla and will play it again. Warstomp can be rather useful when crap gets into the pesky deadzone range, and you would rather it pause for a moment while you get far enough away.
---
Only thing I really hate about female tauren is that damn hitbox. I'm not looking foward to getting stuck on everything.
---
Well try to look at this way.  Even if you plan on being a hardcore raider, the majority of your time in Classic will be leveling and a large chunk of your time once you hit 60 will be in 5man dungeons.  I think that too much thought is put into the endgame of Classic primarily because most people who talk about play Private servers with XP boosts or streamlined content patches.  Classic WoW is going be a slowburn for a lot of people, and I suspect that even the Raids will be a lot harder than they expect.  We already *know* that no Private server has gotten Boss Armor and Resistances right, so what else will be different?
---
Prot Pallies may get laughed out of raids, but they are hella fun and appreciated in dungeons and leveling with Holy Shield and Reckoning is really efficient.  That's just what I did on Nostalrius a few years ago and I made a lot of friends by Tanking my way through the upper dungeons.  I knew I was going to respec Holy once I started earning my pre-BIS, but I didn't regret my time tanking at all.  
---
I know my own limitations and the 52-60 grind just absolutely drains me, so the ability to AoE farm and Dungeon level as a Pally Tank made something that I've always hated into something I loved and plan on doing the exact same come Classic launch. People may not want the Prot Pally in their Raid, but they'll remember the guy who spammed Tribute Runs or got the UBRS key with them.
---
He just needs to lower the input volume/gain or move a little further away from the mic.
---
Maybe so, but others will be logged in and ready to camp him as soon as he turns on his stream
---
Problem is, Thalnos is the unofficial BR server. Have fun with that.
---
You are correct.
---
He could, but let's be honest. We are all humans. If staff of Jordan drops, do you give it to a guildy or sell it for cold hard cash?
---
Slings personal insults, receives them back, clutches pearls.
---
You're that kid everyone grew up with who likes to insult/attack people, then immediately play the victim when they get anything back. Most of those kids grew up though.

The short and sweet answer is Utility. Every one has something that could be arguably better than something else in a given situation. And this promotes working together. Like the warrior shaman power duo

This was the horde view of that fight
---
Hard to read this when the title lists the literal min max bis race for a priest by a long shot.
---
Why would you bother customizing now if you care about your name?
---
Because those numbers are faked. It's a common known issue with private servers. Even servers you normally wouldn't think *need* to fake their numbers, do, because in the end it helps with player retention the higher the number is.
---
It's hilarious to go to a private server and do a /who to see the population, and see something like 1032 people online. Then you backport an addon like Super Guild Invite and watch the /who checks, and it quickly becomes noticeable that there's actually 32 people online, not 1032.

CLaSsSiC wOW GRapHIcS ARe shIt

Wow Classic, but maybe if I play regular Wow :)
---
I found warstop to actually be pretty useful for when shits right on you and you need time to back the hell up. Deadzone etc.
---
Unless their entire guild today decided on what server they are going to run on launch, and happened to get the short end of the stick. We aren't gonna move or be forced to move. Most of the followers wont keep up in level with the streamer after 2 days, and will move on.
---
Launch day will suck tho.
---
I’d agree with you if the Hunter class wasn’t broken, and hasn’t been fixed even after beta.
---
As our server had a big Alliance imbalance they were mostly Alliance farmers to meet demand. Sometimes when I found a Horde one I was able to stick PVP on and trick them into attacking but most were programmed better than that and avoided getting PVP turned on at all costs. Could still just dump mobs on them though of course.
---
I don't want to join any premades that think resto shamans are useless. I want to win.
---
Yeah it is less that I am worried about being picked for raids but just that it is an unenjoyable class.  I will probably go with Paladin, I hear it is good for PVP which I will probably do more than raiding anyways.
---
Then go play retail.
---
tullarange is not a bar addon.
---
You will literally find out tomorrow.
---
For the boxes you have to press enter. A couple people have had the same issue so I'm thinking about just making it update whenever the value changes.
---
Nice! This is a great update

If it's not too much to ask, could you also have a toggle for quest mob/object locations? I basically just want to see where to get all the quests but not how to do them

Pastime\*
---
Should definitely label the picture correctly as “WoW Classic Stress Test”. This test was specifically designed to test layering.
---
WoW classic isn’t out yet. It launches August 27th.
---
IDK who this guy is but if he's in a streamer gank guild, I'll try and join him.
---
Who cares? Most playing from BR can speak English anyway and they only make up ~6% of the total population of the whole realm last I checked. Stop being racist and let everyone play where they want to play.
---
Honestly, I'm not sure! I just thought I should include it in the table since it was mentioned, because it might be important for some people. I doubt it would even be that many people / have any real impact whatsoever though. And no problem! :)
---
Some people think layering is sharding
---
Layering is like sharding,but instead of that area like the starting zone being its own instance on the server. The entire kalimdor continent will have it's multiple layers. Inviting people can bring them into your layer, logging off and back on can put you in a new layer.
---
Shards is much smaller scale and meant to bring different realms together cross-realm style the place them into their own instance and certain areas in each zone.
---
All of this is wearing off as blizzard feels it's no longer needed for a streamline quest experience. There are quests that you need to loot 60 things from three different mobs. There are only so many that can be killed in such a small amount of time. A lot of people won't be grouped up questing. Every starting zone has a mob that you need to kill and  mob tags don't share outside of a group. Layering is a must or we will be in the starting zone for over 5 hours. It's a necessary evil to make sure we keep the huge population on classic for as long as possible.
---
Truly amazing
---
Let me pose a question to you. 1 million concurrent players day 1 down to 100k concurrent players by the end of month 1. What do you do? What's your solution? Now consider you aren't sure the exact numbers but are confident about the trend and need a dynamic solution. What do you do?
---
i think everyone is overreacting to this.  
---
Also Sodapoppin is not going to stream Classic.  
---
My biggest concern is Layering tbh.
---
This comment *screams* "I have not been paying attention to the actualities of layer, I just think it's this one thing, so I'm going to voice my concerns about it"
---
Every single piece of information we know about layering contradicts the issues you're mentioning; such as removing layering before phase 2, restricting layering to lower level zones, etc.
---
Accurate.
---
I think it will. I've heard they were testing the community menu from retail.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Why don't you sit down and let the adults handle their business instead of throwing shit around you don't understand
---
No one was saying a damn thing about Faerlina so it's the one I chose. Hopefully it stays under the radar.
---
engrish is hard
---
what
---
shouldnt it work somehow? in beta cdew played arenas while doing stuff in classic
---
I find it especially odd as 15 years ago there was no layering and the servers ran ok, why have they decided to do this now when the servers are much more powerful and should be able to handle this many players with ease?
---
Calling weed "drugs" smh.
---
Y'all do know all the streamers are rolling on Herod, right?
---
Mods have to delete any discussion of real issues so they can focus on creating boogiemen out of streamers and coordinating witch hunts on them.
---
Nice. Thank you.
---
Get a second account?
---
Must be Thex
---
How did that work with the layering system?

Sounds like retail would suit you more if being "toxic" is such a big deal to you, the people that are returning are the same people you consider toxic, they were the real og players who made the game great, that PC shit kills fun.
---
It's hypocracy to tell others to get over it but at the same time whine about others wanting some streamers names, even tho we all have the exact same chance of getting those names.
---
He ran a census program and it just goes and searches classes levels etc and he would have to switch faction and run it again
---
Si to switch layers, all someone needs to do is invite you? They don’t even need to be in the same zone? 
---
... I’m surprised there is no addon to layer switch right now. I’d abuse it tbh
---
*THANK YOU*
---
I got downvoted to hell in another post because I dared say the same thing in regards to a screenshot of a near-empty Org.  It astounds me that more people can't understand this.
---
Where is asmon playing?
---
It's been tried in raid gear, not preraid bis.
---
No im not hating them for it just pointing out it was an issue; that they are trying to avoid this time.
---
It's not RMT because they aren't being paid in real money. Sure someone might spend their money to buy the gold in retail, but then the seller is being paid that retail gold for the carry, not actual money.
---
Let them.
---
If there's a server that can fight them, it's Herod!
---
He talks often about how much he has ninja looted in the past. He would join guilds on his stream, just to try and loot their guild banks with whatever he could get. If he sees an opportunity to make some people angry over where they reserved names, then he will take it.
---
All I gotta say is don't be like that, and then try to play on a PVP server. It won't be pretty.
---
From polish groups/sites related to WoW

 My apologies if the formatting is bad, I'm on mobile. Brian Birmingham said recently on an interview with Eurogamer: 
---
&gt;!The only thing I really want to call out on layering is a lot of people were wondering if the population thresholds in the beta were accurate, and they're not. There were some people who said, 'Did they just turn this on to test it functionally to make sure it worked?' That's accurate. We set the thresholds much lower on the beta than we would for live because we wanted to make sure we were actually testing the feature!&lt;
---
So I think it's going to be fine. I'm sure many, many more people will be on each layer at launch.
---
I pay my sub 
---
Why do I have to sit in the back?
---
I sit wherever I want
---
It worked fine. It's not over yet. Even got to witness myself killing Esfand on his stream LOL.
---
Sorry - was being Sarcastic.
---
too bad bears are going to destroy the world before then
---
Alliance are always the underdogs, thank goodness.  Dwarf holy pally pvp here I come.
---
You're saying the Alliance got wrecked? With defenders advantage? What a surprise 🙄😂😂
---
This sub definitely has the majority of players who will play Classic more than 2 months
---
Yesterday it was streamers, today it is layers, tomorrow it will be something about character creation.
---
Read his replies to my comment. He proved my point.
---
Let's pretend they do fuck with the ToS, and ruin let's say, Herod then the Whitemane server are all up in arms and they move there and do the same shit and enough people report them and get them banned. The exact same shit will happen with ( I think it was Soda in Cata? Maybe MoP ) where he did something against the ToS, Got banned, Then proceeded to have all his fan boys flood Twitter,Reddit,Mmo champion and even the WoW forums till he was unbanned.
---
So sadly in a way, the trolls get what they want. Cause drama, Make $$, Get banned, Proceed to get unbanned, Rinse repeat.
---
That's just extremely dry humor.
---
As someone who does dry humor, I can see it a mile away.
---
Well yeah, the stress test is almost over and no one wants to get invested in a character that's going to get wiped in 12 hours.
---
&gt;the only thing Blizzard has said about layering since its initial announcement is that they cranked it up a bit during beta    
---
Please read the other thread.  In this stress test the increased the layer threshhold "much more" to test some things.   
---
This stress test is nothing like it will be on launch.  You will see more people in the cities because this test was set up differently with regards to layers.   
---
How the fuck is everyone missing the point that what you saw in the stress test is nothing like it will be on live?
---
No it isn't, if two populations and communities are essentially dead, merging them is a benefit, not a downside.
---
I'm a big fan of game design and could write a long description of why having everyone being viable is one thing and a restricted amount of class+specs and even races being optimal is a whole different thing, and this depends more on the community than the designers. But instead I'll just resume this more easily, even if the design was to make every spec feel special in their own way, wethere there is a tradeoff or there isn't, projects of this size are so massive and have so many little things to adjust and balance, that they're never adjusted the exact way they were intended, you realize someone is doing way too much damage or it plays too similar to another class/spec so you need a temporary measure to counter this blowing out of proportion, and sometimes you don't get the chance to correct or fix that issue until it becomes a problem again so that particular class/specc may remain underwhelming for a long time until a major mechanics revision comes up like an expansion.
---
TLDR; They had a project, they had goals set, they had to meet a deadline, mmos tend to be broken one way or another because they're huge and hard to balance.
---
As a hardcore raider who has played on an RP-PvP server, I can attest to the fact that the raiding talent is... less than amazing. They are fun and have tons of community, but if you seriously want to raid? Don't do it there.
---
There is NOT going to be a guild raiding MC week 1 on an RP-PvP Server.
---
Because bugs exist? Because it was a testing environment? Because they could be lying about which systems are being implemented or how?
---
Introducing new servers and hoping a huge number of people decide to completely start fresh is a terrible plan, and won't work nearly to a degree where they'd be able to remove layering
---
Well done!  I'm hoping classic WoW can help me quit drinking, it's one of the few games I actually don't like to play while drinking - it's a bit too slow paced.
---
Literally no one knows.
---
If you look at how much the original population increased to burning Crusade, and then again in Wrath, I'd say there's a pretty good chance lizard is going to take these servers at least that far. Either in making them all progress through expansion, for making new servers for burning Crusade and later on wrath that players can copy characters over to. But one way or another I am very confident that these characters we play in classic will be given the opportunity to progress further. And honestly, maybe the entire way because why not.
---
Thats true. Blacklist em all.
---
They have done this in the past and have always offered free server transfers to them.
---
If classic is a success in the eyes of blizzard I can see them doing TBC and WotLK. You can't put a percentage or anything on it because they have yet to say if they will keep going. Give it like 4+ months in classic then you might be able to determine what that are going to do.
---
Hopefully once people are actually occupied by playing the game this shitstorm fizzles out. I agree with the reasoning for avoiding big streamers, but all of the threads like this just make the entire sub and community worse and more toxic.
---
yea i don't think it will be needed after 1-10
---
Look, here are a few examples from the stress test already that make me salty. This isn't "I saw a youtube video" or "I read a reddit comment".
---
First I was just playing by myself on an UD mage, but I decided to run him to the orc spawn. someone asked me why I ran over, and we ended up just talking and having a good time as we leveled to like 7. I then logged off for like 20 minutes and ate some lunch. Got back on and was doing some level 7 or 8 quests and was thinking how I didn't recognize any of the people around me and assumed it's just because I left for a bit. I whispered him and it turns out he was actually doing the same quest I was on and invited me and I phased into his layer. At which point I recognized another duo pair who had been kicking around with matching names from earlier. This essentially doesn't matter for gameplay purposes. But the fact that after taking a break and coming back I ended up in a different layer. This meant I was no longer seeing the people I otherwise would have recognized and talked to.
---
Later a much more significant example. Some of my buddies found out the stress test was going on, and were hyped to get on and futz around. I told them my friend and I are already on and will play alliance guys with them. Little did they know I already have a level 15 horde toon out there. Our goal was to convince them to flag themselves thinking there was no threat what so ever of horde attacking them in elwynn forest. Then swoop in for the level 3 gank in the abbey, for mega chuckles. Sure enough we got him to type /pvp and then swooped in to give him a taste of some level 15 frostbolt action. Oh wait, they're not here. How am I supposed to get onto the same layer as them? Well the answer was we didn't. So our little prank we intended to enact didn't even work.
---
They've already won if you are this concerned about them. You sheeple
---
said streamer makes them so much money they'll ban you instead 10 out of 10 times
---
Do you accept an English speaking Norwegian?
---
I'm standing in front of IF at 9:10 pm and it's bright as day out.  I thought they brought back day/night cycles.
---
Has nothing to do with racism lmao. Has to do with being unable to effectively communicate with a large portion of the playerbase. Have you tried playing with BRs in retail? It severely hurts the experience. If you can't talk to your group isn't half the fun gone?
---
The cost is the same whether they make more server or more layers....they are not being cheap lol
---
Where;s a good place to go for people wondering if RP-PvP is a good idea to roll on?
---
I love that you all rolled on it!
---
The dire maul farming exploits do a thousand times more damage than layering could ever hope to do, but I am guessing you are fine with that, right?
---
I can't bear the thought of what you are going to say.
---
If they plan on releasing different expansions, they need to leave classic alone and release the other expansions separately.
---
These streamers are acting like littlw whiney bitches. It's pretty pathetic that this is how adults are acting. It's even more pathetic that Blizz is either supporting them or allowing special treatment to these individuals because they allow for free advertising. 
---
Blizz. You're a multi-million if not billion dollar company. Stop giving these self entitled cry babies leeway. Take action against the streamers that have said on their streams that they demand their sheep to blacklist players because pvp happened. Stop enabling toxic behavior. You are better than this.
---
You know some of us tanked or witnessed other people tank MC, BWL, AQ, or Onyxica stuff in the actual classic wow. We're not speaking from custom server experience.
---
Thanks, bookmarked the page
---
Somewhat related, people can say what they will about streamers, but these are exactly the kind of events that streamers will also be organising.
---
Up to 80% of the population would have name changes, guild name changes, sudden influx of new faces, not to mention the issues with merging different economies. With layering you gradually start to see more and more of the people who will be permanently playing with you over time and there is no name merge or economy arbitrage issues.

---
Blizz is waiting to see how classic performs before talking about its future.
---
because it's a stress test, &lt;10% of people I know that plan on playing played in the stress test
---
Just take their names on every server.
---
Part of why i quit felt like i was playing alone
---
So how come the layering isn't screwing this up here but in other posts?
---
Layering is here because they learned lessons from previous mistake. The big one was during growth times of throw another server at them attitudes they had to fix the issue. Now there are populated servers that could be self sufficient(other than there is no faction balance anywhere) on some servers but the fact that there are over 225 servers in NA alone tells you why there has to be Xrealm because there is no easy way to merge realms(more problems then good come from this)
---
Leveling as a Shaman on the stress test and not being able to buff people back was heartbreaking. People are so nice.
---
Same issue here, Radeon RX 560. I also noticed occasional flickering shadows aswell, this does not happen in the current game
---
Possibly, but they won’t be congregating on any server as one entity.
---
TBC. Fresh Classic servers so people can do it all over again.
---
What the hell was the point of this post lol?
---
For sure, very little about classic is AFK complete friendly. It requires full attention.
---
Exactly!
---
I leveled a priest to 10 and already get too attached to him. Damnit I should have stopped before

Please delete this before somebody dies
---
Holy fuck, call me stupid but I’ve been dreading having a streamer on my server..
---
There’s some decently big EU streamers but at least the massive ones that have a swarm of kids following them are US..
---
Thank fucking god.
---
I don't doubt that, my interest is in how soon or active will guilds in different server types be ready to tackle progression. I want to do it sooner, non-casually.
---
The ultimate way to express your concern is to not play. Giving blizzard your money is saying you approve of what they are doing.
---
I’m thinking more along the lines of open world herbing, zg crocs, AD, CC, and so on. Obviously some of those are rep farms vs gold farms. I guess I could find the nearest warrior on the rep grinds lol
---
The only real reason you just presented is name changing. Do you REALLY think this issue is enough to warrant layering? In all its downfalls? Seems incredibly arbitrary to me
---
In that case, they're either being very dumb, or malicious.
---
Oh snap I dont think I ever saw this before..

40 coordinated, good players can probably take out a hundred mindless idiots following a streamer.
---
You have groups of servers with a naming pool in common. Extremely easy solution.  
---
The economy thing is not an issue.
---
Then you have to grow from 1 man layers...huge advantage to man 1 on a new layer...
---
Lol this streamer hate is starting to just get really sad.
---
he could save it and give it to his alt, which isn't important here.
---
Do you really think it's that way by design?
---
Thats not what I said at all. I said Herod and Thalnos were being considered, which they were and then someone brought up Faerlina as an option as well, so I added it.
---
nope, ive played wow since bwl patch when the server cap was 3500 and not 45k like classic.
---
nice try though
---
What's that guys unit frames? I know it's lorti ui but the unit frames are different.

Also if you haven’t yet do yourself a favor and play the Starcraft 2 campaign. The first one is free now. It’ll remind you how good blizzard used to be at making games.
---
This is such terrible journalism. No knowledge of the photos he took and no knowledge of the conditions he's in. Private server photo was taken after the announcement of it closing down with thousands having nothing to do but complain and say goodbye in trade chat. It had THOUSANDS more than classic will ever have on any one server in any spot. Also, it's a stress test and even on retail classic, the major cities will be abandoned for a good week or two.
---
Off the top of my head, northshire abbey, goldshire, the kobold mines and surrounding farmsteads south of goldshire should all be pretty populated. Goldshire inn is popping, in that photo, just like I remember it during vanilla on a medium realm, only slightly less players, so it sure wouldn't feel like a high pop.
---
I do feel like it should only be for the first few starting zones, not for the first phase entirely. I, along with many others, will be way too high level by the end of the first phase and it'll really destroy some potential rivalries. I remember fondly this one rogue that split my cheeks every time he saw me until I was level 60. I hit 60 and I started fighting back and winning. A random 60 killing me that I've never seen before isn't as fun. It's more like an "aww that sucks oh well".
---
The thing is in the game world once you let the cat out of the bag on something you can not put it back. Look at the fight they had about removing flying in the last 3 xpacs. They finally came to a conclusion that it will be out for the first half of an xpac and removed later. They would not be able to remove LFR, LFG, BG queuing from the menu, quest helpers, etc from retail because the backlash would be worse than removing it. And then people would just make addons to do the job it was doing.
---
Because this community, like the WoW community in general, is an incredibly whiny, childish, toxic group of human beings. 
---
You’re using logic and not jumping to conclusions. That doesn’t go over well here.
---
Pro tip:  The only people who say this are actually not fun at parties.
---
It's cute to see someone who obviously hasn't felt the destructive force of trying to play an MMO with a BR population on it before.
---
There's no guarantee, plan, or rumor that points to post-vanilla Classic iterations.  
---
Saying "yes" has the same weight as saying "no" on the topic as it stands.  
---
Any person saying one or the other with confidence is lying to you.
---
Do the oce ones!
---
how is Classic wow relevant to drug usage though
---
what is that painting depicting? the original ofc.
---
looks like it has an interesting battle history (if its something real that is).
---
This is my thinking, I may roll an alt on Grob then, keep my main on Whitemane and work hard to get ahead, get noticed, and get into a guild that cares about working together, helping all it's members gear up, and has minimal favoritism.
---
Norwegian happily spreading the word about Shazzrah and this post to all my friends. See you in Azeroth, my neighbors :)
---
They just keep digging their hole deeper. Unfortunate that most people went from "we'll just avoid them" to this\^\^\^. But I'm excited to see the drama unfold live!
---
&gt; TBC-&gt;WotLK-&gt;Cataclysm.
---
Primarily because Cata is trash.
---
Give it a rest you jive turkey.
---
Because physical servers is a lot more expensive, ancient tech, and still leaves them to solve the problems that layering fixes.
---
Ditto... Really want to do a playthrough before for the lore but I dont want to play it twice in the immediate future.
---
GTFO out of here with your logic, and reasonable objectivity.
---
We don’t serve your kind here.

You have no idea how software development works.
---
Did you know it's possible (and extremely common) for bugs to be created even after a game has been released &amp; shipped.
---
Did you know fixing bugs can often create other bugs?
---
Relax man.
---
I liked the super high population.
---
No Yvonne Strahovski?!
---
Not in raids, no. Elemental is borderline overpowered in PvP though.
---
If you choose Shaman, you should be okay with healing full-time in order to get your gear. Your reward for that is using that gear in PvP.
---
Because blizzard doesn't know how many players are going to be playing yet. The next two weeks of name reservation will give them some idea, and then we have lunch and they will see. And if the data shows them that they need more servers, they will turn more servers on.

Yes, merges are tangible evidence that the game is "dying" or at least that would be the perception when 100 realms merge to 20. People see that and think classic is dead and some would stop playing just because of the perception. New players won't join a "dying" game. Layering is invisible, you can't track how many layers there are over time. Not to mention the issues I already brought up.
---
Posts like these make me wonder if someone is sitting at home just name sniping

spending the time to make this writeup is a huge waste of energy.  This is a stress test.  Not even indicative of what will be at launch.  Stop ur crying.

just curious but how exactly can say Asmongold "Ruin" your experience. I imagine the dude will be focused on just leveling for a while and then spamming dungeons. Seems like alot of people consider them being on the server in general is enough to ruin their experience. Aside from that he normally does world pvp raids, might do duel tournaments and raid with all of his followers. People make it sound like the dude is going to sick his entire army on some poor soul to harass them and camp them for hours.

They got to do something with all their anxious energy
---
I figure that's part of the answer. I'd like to be apart of what drives them to continue to WotLK but at the same time I dont want to waste time and sub money if I do t get what I want.
---
You are actually insane dude. You are acting like you can put streamers in a concentration camp. There is no reasoning with you.
---
I actually knew about the cave because it is still in the live game and now is home to a dragon named Andrestrasz. They must have gotten rid of this camp in Cata because it isn't there anymore.
---
They aren’t easier they give more xp than pservers. Pserver had the dungeon xp modifier wrong.
---
Agreed 100%. I remember the feeling when my enthusiasm instantly died in the first few minutes of BC when I realised all my dedication and effort had been rendered worthless. I kept playing for a while, but I just couldn’t force myself to care anymore.
---
It's the same, the only difference is the scope of the shard.
---
Because it’s the real world we are living in. 
---
If a streamer has his name registered and trademarked, then it’s his name, if he haven’t done it it’s not. 
---
But I do agree it’s a shitty move trying to get a streamers name if you are not the guy.
---
With the big windmills right? Loved that place
---
then don't go rp-pvp
---
Because they are so excited and so nervous after having built up what's they think and hope that this experience of classic will be for them, they are so on edge, that literally anything sets them off.
---
Gotta practice speedrun character creations
---
The big thing for me is it would be a waste of time and sub money if it didn't happen. But 60$ might be worth it to see the forecast.

Layering can not exist in the manner you are asking. Layering puts the entire continent in a layer to keep continuity between zones. You are asking for Sharding and sharding would have existed past the starter zones and this and the population complaints about continuity between zones are the reason why they made layering. They are going to be cramming 100k+ people per server at the start. These servers are going to need layers to exist until the tourist move to the new game.
---
Yesterday, in general, there was a discussion on what to call classic vrs retail wow. Well now we know retail will always be retail as its called that in the base system files.
---
Are you cooked mate ?
---
I can. Nobody uses it for PvE dps. It depends on your guild. It's actually not that great of a weapon for warriors, by the time they get to make it. So it's fine for paladins.
---
It's not good for anyone.
---
People who can pay 10k gold for it will typically be the ones to get it.
---
It goes to whoever the guild you are in decides it goes to. It is one of those things that one person will get, but everybody in the raid will be contributing towards that effort and be cognizant of that fact and most people will take some kind of pride in that.
---
Warmode wasn't in mop?

Atiesh. Will be at work when servers open for name reservation and it will be the first on the list so its easy for my girlfriend to find.

Necrosis addon

I get that vibe. The speculation for either side makes sense. So I guess I might have to wait it out and play catch up if it does happen.
---
OI, WEE DWARVES DUNNAE HOW TO HANDLE NATUREY BLADES OF GRASS LAD, GIVE EM A BREAK
---
What's the addon situation? Is there a list of working ones/links?
---
I agree. I played vanilla and every expansion to date on launch day. Layering/Phasing made the new expansions SO SO much smoother than previous. It's not ideal but it is 100% better than spending hours to get out of the start zones.
---
This kind of thing is why I'm maining Holy Nova spec priest come Classic. I want to know if Sanctity Aura is worth it!
---
lol. Any of the pro Pserver guilds would destroy even a server full of idiots. Just go watch MN and APES ceremoniously wipe 3+ guilds of raids at the same time, 100+ people in black rock with their single raid group.
---
Streamers actually think they're going to be top dop in classic. They have no idea what pro classic guilds/players are actually capable of. Trust me they will be embarassed time and time again if once these guys learn their raid schedules, and may even have to start raiding based around the Nost boys if they want to actually raid with buffs lol, because they will, without a doubt, be humiliated every time.
---
You can't stealth from a GM...
---
And if the streamer is playing a stealth class themselves it's pretty obvious once they get followed perfectly.
---
Can you reserve names by using a free trial? Has Blizzard said anything about that?
---
I have experienced this, it is concerning.
---
That said, it’s a stress test and wouldn’t surprise me they’re aggressively layering for that very reason.
---
Humans bad
---
you people are fucking clowns. this triggers me. coffee comes from a plant, is caffeine not a drug? coca leaves (not talking about cocaine) give you a buzz, is that not a drug? kratom is a plant, it gets you high, is it a drug? is tobacco a drug? are psilocybin mushrooms not a drug?
---
and I'm no anti-weed person, by the way, im vaping weed right now. this 'weed is not a drug, its a plant' thing is so fucked and i have no clue why people say this
---
Sharding and layering are not the same thing. 
---
Servers and instances are not the same thing.
---
Because it’s retail.
---
You are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.
---
Use it when you're on the move, that's about it.
---
It's not a very good weapon period. If you see the mats drop, they'll probably just go to the first person willing to spend 10k gold to craft it
---
Mage AoE and goblin sapper charges
---
Of course it's fucking dead....  There's virtually no reason to go there.  Layers are continent wide.  For every 1 person wasting their time standing in IF, there's a 200 outside killing shit on your layer.  
---
When you get to max level, there's a lot more people standing in IF, because they're trying to sell shit, put shit in the bank, and generally just waiting for groups.
---
You are comparing a screenshot of a server that's at the end of it's life cycle, and cherry picked at that, to a server that's a day or two old and capped at level 15.   It's apples and oranges.
---
Hey if you think it's going to be such a big impact buy some stock and grab some free money
---
Except it was about him picking a paladin over the title.
---
They didn't lie about anything. Ion said that they are looking into using sharing for things like the starter zones for the first few weeks. He did not say anything definite. This is why companies hate giving *any* information about their game before it's released because people twist that information so hard.
---
HOLD THE LINE!!
---
Cities are always instanced.
---
You farkin what mate.
---
They realized after the first stress test and the closed beta that they were going to need to shard or layer much past the early zones. Even with people spreading out it is not going to be pleasant. And the static layers does not solve any of the scalability issues that will be there. Dynamic layering solves the issue off 6000 players login in at 5:30PM after work and then the next 5000 players login in a 6:00 PM as it can spin up a new layer automatically.
---
IT'S A STRESS TEST. TEST BEING THE KEY WORD HERE.
---
Uhh, they totally can? There's literally videos on this sub right now of people changing layers as they zone in to f.ex. orgrimmar. So the game can have everyone who zones to orgrimmar go into the same layer, while splitting people up when there's 1k+ players on the lowbie zone so your early game isn't queue simulator and playing whack-a-mole with spawns. This of course assumes they're competent with the implementation, which is probably just wishful thinking.
---
I also experience the issue where all my macros have a question mark as the icon when I first start the game. #showtooltip has been working fine for me though with my macros.
---
Paladins have to be left behind for one simply reason... Horde don't have them. The Paladin can do everything a Shaman can do but they can also tank. How is that fair? There is a reason on why Blizzard gave  both factions both classes in BC because they felt it impossible to balance and keep them unique.
---
Hey man, I've got a school that needs building. You think you could put a crew together, pretend to build it, send me an invoice anyway, and then call me a racist when I refuse to pay?
---
1 Nelf resto druid for me. Had a rogue alt that was in the 20s-30s.
---
Old water always gave me a headache while fishing, so I'm happy to see the new water personally, but yea
---
It goes to whoever can afford the mats to make the damn thing. The fucker costs 5000+ gold in mats easily, and we're not giving whoever wants it the gold and mats for it. So if someone has 2-3k gold on top of epic riding, and the eye drops, they're eligible to roll for it, regardless if they're an Officer, a Trial, a resto Shaman, or a prot Warrior. Idc either way.
---
Fact of the matter is, Sulfuras is a shitty weapon outside of PvP and I don't want to see it in my raids, even if a guildie has it.
---
COrrect, I was wrong.
---
Man, this is going to kill wpvp. Is this only limited to the starting zones or does it affect the entire server?
---
&gt;, but there's a turd in the punchbowl
---
ohh there is, but it's you fucking doomsayers that don't even understand what layering is.
---
Noticed in the current beta (first I've played) that the start zones are made easy, then goes to true vanilla once you leave, why is that? By this I mean as undead for example deathknell is extremely easy, retail easy. Then as soon as you're on your way to brill, the real difficulty kicks in where NPCs hit hard, you constantly miss etc
---
It's late to do this, but the major cities should be sharded. Not to divide players, but to conentrate them. There should exist as few instances of each major city as possible with the capacity determined only by stable server capacity. Player layer assignment should persist from entering to leaving the city shard if possible, but it wouldn't be critical and could provide an additional opportunity to relatively subtly phase people by doing it when they're already phasing.
---
I love this idea! Would be a legend on any server for that
---
Imagine all the players who will be logging on and, having never read a single thread here, just pick a server and go. Gosh, I bet they're just going to have the most horrible, inauthentic, ruined experience.
---
Asmon doesn't play a stealth class, so it's a moot point in his case.
---
Yes, it is. Classic had these capabilities also you know. They were just off by default because most potatoes couldn’t support it.
---
8 weeks is not a few weeks.
---
What if a streamer just decides to switch servers one day?
---
A lot of people didn't seem to know that is what its referred to as. One guy was saying he just calls it by whatever the current expansion is.
---
Except the transfers did not work in Vanilla to balance servers out, they only lead to more populated servers, people losing their name, etc. This is the problem we have in Retail wow. Too many servers with a smaller player base then WotLK.
---
Look!  This peasant does not enjoy the festivities!
---
This is why he’s the top wow streamer and not some no name
---
If he had done that no one would give a shit
---
Instead we’re talking about it
---
Wrong. I plan on playing the shit out of classic but if layering stays on past phase 2 me and all my guildies are out. We'll go back to pservers where there's an actual community you can see and interact with.
---
So that transmog in the top right, what in the name of every single Warcraftian entity of immense power IS THAT MONSTROSITY.
---
Wrath shoulders, BFA chestplate, Eye of N'Zoth kept,
---
:hiss:
---
I think it is a necessary evil in the beginning, and eventually it will pass ... so I don’t think it is that big of a deal tbh.
---
Dud whatever it takes! There is never a better time than now. Don’t let classic blow up your better habits ;)
---
Good place to start is here on the classic forums! Just search "RP-PvP" and find threads that lend info into the inner workings of that kind of server.  Like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cnj3dv/about_rppvp/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cmqudh/rppvp_servers_in_world_of_warcraft/), even better [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9vmqj/an_ode_to_rppvp_servers/), or even you very question possibly [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cneuip/as_someone_who_never_played_on_rp_servers/)
---
Please go play on private servers, classic will be better without you
---
Server merges fucking suck dude. I'd take layering for the first phase over server merges any day.
---
Overwatch... and it is NOT filling the void.
---
The three greateat feeling in the early days is getting your first shoulders, helm, and a long cape that reaches the ground.
---
I enjoy the fact that they put in the option to play at higher graphics settings. I love the old models but i also love ground clutter and all of the effects we can enable now. Including Actioncam. Try playing with action cam it really adds something to playing. anyway, really can't wait for classic release, gonna take a few days of work off.
---
The  "core" will be about the private server populations. Those people who  started on private servers in the old days are adults now and they can  afford 15$ per month. Less if you buy gametime from weird sources or  even free if they farm an evening on retail to buy a token.
---
XXX server had 800k registered accounts with about 150k logged in in the last month of the server.
---
YYY  had a couple servers with 10k concurrent players in peak hours. Thats  about 40k online population at peak hours. Probably at least 100k active  players. In the middle of the night, there are about 10k players online  on YYY right now.
---
And there were / still are TONS of p servers.
---
10 servers per region is stupid. On EU at least, to give 2+2 english servers is retarded.
---
Classic also got me off weed, I was a daily smoker. Cant be MT if I’m stoned everyday. Sounds ridiculous but it’s real.
---
Warstomp is pretty dope for hunter.
---
I played Vanilla. I'm fine with layering for a few weeks. I want to actually be able to quest through the first few zones.
---
What do you want to know?
---
Mage can farm for your warrior
---
I played all weekend, as well as other friends, there’s a bigger spectrum of player types and styles.
---
Ha! Me being triggered by them is a symptom of some other stupid disease. We’ll all be fine 🥴

Im that last person to bitch about blizzards work, I'm not even that fanatic about layering. But to have polls and groups of several thousand different language people plan to roll on 1/3 and possibly 2/3 of your east-US servers sound like a huge amount of oversight.  
---
   
---
I could give a shit about streamers or layering, but I've played enough DotA to be sick of most SA players
---
It would kind of suck to roll a toon, and realize at lvl 50 that you rolled on the unofficial BR server. At least I think it would. Apparently lots of other people feel the same.
---
No it’s new in BFA.
---
yeah like i said, never heard a good argument.
---
TBH it probably goes to a holy pally or resto shaman, that respecs frequently for pvp.
---
It's just a beta they won't release like this
---
Yea I've heard that way too many times. Stop defending blizzard. Nothing will get done about layering if you keep making excuses for them.

Level your main first whichever it is even if it sucks at farming.

---
Game so good it’ll ruin your life
---
Ya there was some people getting very particular about this. At least now we can just ignore them.
---
That isn't the same comparison at all, the 'Its just beta' memes were referring to bugs and intentionally bad design. You're comparing that to a literal lack of players??? It doesn't even make fucking sense. The layer populations are lower because they want more layers up to STRESS TEST their systems. And again like he mentioned, it is a comparison of the picture of Nostalrius' last moments and a stress test server city.
---
Okay, so I hear X guild is grouping up right outside of the Blasted Lands to get ready to do the world boss. My guild goes to catch them by surprise so we can kill the world boss. We go to kill them, but they're on another layer, so they can just walk right into the Blasted Lands and kill the boss while we're sitting outside of the Blasted Lands looking for them after popping our PvP consumables and everything.
---
This would fucking suck.
---
nud
---
Usually there is a bit of an uproar and people point out that Finland is nordic but not scandinavian.

Raids/dungeons are still instanced, and you lose nothing upon pvp death. All servers are PvE as far as old mmos go.

All the super-virgins (those that didn't know what a sun was till the age of 30) want that same scuffed experience because they had a scuffed experience as a kid and want to remember the 'good old times' like a bunch of 40 year old atari ping pong playing asses.
---
If you are grouped up the layering shouldn't mess with you too much but we will see what happens in when classic is live.
---
Mage is boring as hell in pve.  Made me quit vanilla, no joke.
---
So i should probably level a warrior first since i am going to lvl with friends ? and aoe grind as mage
---
I don’t think the streamers are going to have as much power as people think they will. I’ve been watching Esfands stream tonight with this huge fight that’s going on and at one point there were more horde responding to his commands than his own crew lol. They can’t really control something like that and they will look ridiculous if they get so tilted over the sniping, they will just make it worse for themselves.
---
Wait... what? Really? Even if I only have up to WoD, the only thing I have to buy to play Classic is a sub??
---
Blizzard will never merge a realm, they would have done it along time ago if they were. Instead they came up with other solutions(Xrealm). And free transfers do not solve anything, they have never solved the issues. When they offer free transfers one of 2 things happen, almost no one leaves or one big guild leaves and a huge populations follows them and then the issue just moves from one server to another. You end up with one dead server and one over populated server.......What isn't that what we were trying to fix. This happened in vanilla Shattered Hand server, They were super overpopulated with multiple raiding guilds including Death and Taxes. They opened free transfers to a couple servers, D&amp;T left and 3/4 of the population from SH server followed them and brought all the issues there.
---
Did you not use the term aggro radius?
---
C u Next Tuesday ... was the most common word I heard in all my time in Australia.
---
You hear it in church, you hear it at the beach, you hear it on the street, you hear it in your fing sleep.
---
Bring back the C word!
---
Last I checked on the census, Brazilians make up ~6% of Thalnos and Spanish speakers make up less than ~3% of Faerlina. No one cares that much.
---
That just sounds like layering with extra steps.
---
please let me know if you figure out a solution, I'm having the same issue!
---
I played as horde back then and i will play horde again when vanilla will be launched.
---
But for me i played as shaman, all i did i totems! Like if i didnt had it up for 1 sec i got yelled at...
---
But then i came to realise the guy who yelled at me was a ROGUE! The most selfish class in the game! =/
---
I noticed each time I'd level, below the text saying increase in agility Stam etc it would say ..

Your skill in assassination has increased to 15

Your skill in combat has increased to 15

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Abu_Klea
---
Thank god THANK YOU.
---
**Battle of Abu Klea**
---
The Battle of Abu Klea, or the Battle of Abu Tulayh took place between the dates of 16 and 18 January 1885, at Abu Klea, Sudan, between the British Desert Column and Mahdist forces encamped near Abu Klea. The Desert Column, a force of approximately 1,400 soldiers, started from Korti, Sudan on 30 December 1884; the Desert Column's mission, in a joint effort titled "The Gordon Relief Expedition", was to march across the Bayuda Desert to the aid of General Charles George Gordon  at Khartoum, Sudan, who was besieged there by Mahdist forces.
---
The place is generally known in British military records as Abu Klea, which arose as a contemporary British spelling of its Arabic name, 'Abu Tͅuleiħ (أَبُو طُلَيْح).

tbh im kinda happy with how layering works for questing zones as the article mentioned you dont wanna wait 20 mins to kill a quest mob for this reason alone im fine with this layering but id like it off for cities and inns
---
If you have never played wow before how do you even have a reference point to compare it to?
---
as OP said; it's insanely rare. There might be half a dozen total across all servers by the time rag is dead. It's still technically BiS for a while.
---
Thank you for your response!
---
Their plan is clearly states that layering will last up to phase 2.  It will be turned off before phase 2 to prevent any sort of exploit of world bosses.  They can't really fix this any other way, except to turn off layering, so there's no option to keep it.
---
Worst case scenario, the delay phase 2 a bit, offer free xfers off asmongold's server, and potentially open up a new server.
---
Dumpsterfire
---
Haha awesome, I wish you had asked me! Speed cooking is probably my favourite :)
---
Probably a missing "s" in there, you cant edit your title :(
---
This is a great post and I just don’t think it’ll happen though. In the stress test which I just finished up with, seeing IF and stormwind both completely empty while a /who brought up 50+ players was just such a disappointment and is just so against the spirit of WoW. Here’s hoping there’s time to fix or change this in two weeks.
---
People don't say drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes "doing drugs", yet smoking weed is "doing drugs"? Hell, taking some Tylenol isn't "doing drugs", and I think that's all he's getting at. It shouldn't be labeled under the same act as shooting up heroin or meth which to me, is "doing drugs".
---
Classic Aura Durations + OmniCC is what I recommend.
---
The difference is in the fact it is much more likely for someone to take their names. Just like anything on the internet I have my opinion which means as little as yours , so I will happily agree to disagree and bid you a wonderful start to your Classic WoW experience, maybe see you in game!
---
this prevents the issue of underpopulation later. They have to be careful on how many servers they launch with because you could end up with dead servers and people leaving because of that.
---
How hard is it to farm a wow token if you have never played retail?
---
I almost did that with Ragnaros back in the day.
---
Spent almost a week leveling a new char until I realized that something was amiss
---
No they fucking were not you lying piece of shit.  Quit spreading misinformation.  We all love this game you’re fucking it up.
---
It's not fun for everyone, and it's certainly not fun for anyone when it lasts for days and no one can get anything done.
---
Today I did a /who and there was more than 50 people. I saw three of them.
---
yea, i don't want to roll a streamer server but if we do, i literally couldn't care less. the only thing ill avoid is partying and doing raids with a streamer.
---
Yea, and many people/guilds didn't use them on fear of ending up on a dead server.
---
We don't know that all the PST servers will be hosted in LA and all the EST servers will be hosted in Chicago. It's never been like that on Retail.
---
Realm transfers are automated now. It is just a register in a DB
---
At least 3.
---
Thank you for taking this question seriously. I am not a fan of kiwi fruit personally but I agree its a staple. Strawberries are my jam so they're definitely on there for me. I'd never considered peaches but if you recommend it I will give it a try this Christmas! :D
---
1 or 2 servers?   The attrition rate will be like 90%.  You would need to take the number of servers and multiple by at least 5.
---
I thought Herod was the community designated (major) streamer free server?
---
There is no link between Classic &amp; Retail, so just play Classic on a second account.
---
Hahahahahaha this is a troll comment right? You obviously don’t understand dynamic hosting technology.
---
Awesome man, much appreciated.  The new macros are still over the limit though according to WoW and [this site](https://www.lettercount.com/) (first one by 2, second one by 1).  Out of curiosity I plugged the macros into [this website](https://wordcounter.net/character-count) (the second search result) and it shows it at 254 characters for the first one.  I don't know how two character counters can disagree with each other but it seems like wow calculates characters the same way https://www.lettercount.com/ does.
---
Last night at 3am I was in stormwind saw a person offering free enchants to bracers and chest as a way for him to burn thru his mats to help players for free and get skill gains I go over and blammo he is layered cant see so much for the dynamic experience of living in a bustling city busy with people.
---
At 3 am saturday/Sunday layering forced upon the player base. Blizzard has no idea how bad this is for a MMO. If you cannot even turn off layering in Stormwind and make it a gathering hub.
---
Its quite nice beer!
---
I accept that weed is a psychedelic and mind altering substance. But no not a drug. I consider drugs to be cocaine, Vicodin, meth etc. ..
---
Trying very hard and failing to see a problem. Then again EU we are quite used to different languages.
---
I highly doubt any Streamer's motive is to "ruin" your server.
---
replacing one addiction with another.  
---
all jokes aside, congratz man.
---
What happens when phase 1 has been going on for 6+ months and layering is still needed? Just hold off on phase 2 forever? The hardcore players would have already moved to a private server and be clearing BWL at that point.
---
Bingo!
---
Amazing, thanks so much!
---
Any way to access options for it? It's a little large for my UI
---
Why are you crying? Forget about streamers dude.
---
Their followers won't be able to keep up after level 10 to 20 zones. It'll be smooth sailing from there.
---
It’s layering.  You’re wrong.
---
Madseason babiii &lt;3
---
That was sharding and people flipped out about continuity between zones, etc. They also realized that they would have issues in higher level zones as well with population on the beta.
---
This absolutely did not happen in vanilla.
---
garrosh is the best
---
Those 100 people were on different layers... because a layer takes into account population for the entire continent, it isn't a zone-by-zone thing, right? It doesn't matter that there were a hundred of them in the city, when they were so massively outweighed by the thousands out questing in the start zones. That won't be the case at release, with higher thresholds and a more natural dispersion of players into the city hubs and other zones
---
Free server transfers off of more populated realms.
---
zoomer.
---
Can confirm Korea to US east is better than OCE. Timezones are the main issue
---
Blizzard needs to remove it and open more realms.
---
True.
---
I'm going to be rolling ally at launch with a group of mates, and I'm rolling warrior. I know I want to pick between human and gnome and I'm pretty torn between them. I don't plan on being MT but would like to OT / dps in a raid setting, and I enjoy pvp. 
---
So I kinda dream of going human because I'd like to go for ironfoe and without the mace spec it's probably not as good, + the first toon I rolled in vanilla was a human war and I never got him past 33. The plus sides for gnome are escape artist which is insane for pvp and the fact that I want to be a small dude jumping around like Yoda in pvp/pve. 
---
Any advice?
---
How dead do you really think Classic will be after 2 months? This sub only has ~169k users, and if that's the majority of players then there'd hardly be more than 300k Classic players in 2 months. Even that would be unrealistically assuming every single user in this sub to be playing for more than 2 months.
---
(If I'm missing the hyperbole/sarcasm then my bad)
---
The difference in effect a streamer like asmongold or sodapoppins has on a server will be many, many times the amount of all of the other streamers combined. If you even take a streamer like Esfand or tips, you are looking at viewers who simply enjoy their content and will maybe follow them around as friends would hang out with other friends. Asmongold and sodapoppins do not have that base of viewers, they have fanatics to a near point of god hood in what I consider a psychological disorder.
---
Staysafe, payo and other streamers may have dozens of people helping them get a tidal charm. Asmon/soda will have thousands of rabid fanbois searching and clearing every single layer in order for them to get a tidal charm.
---
You want a scepter? Too bad asmon will have thousands of people following him around killing people in layers around elites in silithus as well as grinding for him. You want arena master? Too bad soda will have that on lockdown. You want any amount of conversation in general chat or any type of economy in trade? To bad that shit will be filled to the brim with twitch chat memes and asmongolds latest new mounts required.
---
Now here is the scary part, a lot of the streamers plan on being on the same server, so whether you are horde or alliance it will longer be a story you can create yourself, no longer a journey of a beginning adventure to a hero. It will be a story of dank memes and streamer jerking off.
---
I may be overblowing it but I think it will drastically shift the dynamic of server and will simply not be the classic experience many people want.
---
I'm not sure why I did go off on your comment exactly, I just needed to get it all off my chest. Send me your counseling bill and enjoy your time in wow friend.
---
Fury is literally top DPS from Tier1-3 (once you get a little gear)
---
When blizzard published their stress test for everyone, i was playing as horde, the most traumatic moment of my life!
---
I was just a young cub, joining the horde forces in durotar, and all of a sudden like 100000 people runnning for the same mob i was after like it was a black friday sale! Those memories will hunt me forever!
---
Yeah people are talking like this is a completely unprecedented situation. They had to open new servers for the original launch of the game and that worked out okay. There are other MMOs who have started with way too many servers and that pretty much always turns out worse than adding new servers and offering transfers.
---
Faerlina and Thalnos is sabotaging the line so they don't go to their own servers.
---
You can't see the problem of not being able to talk to ~10% of the server you are on, when there's an option where that isn't the case?
---
It's not that it's a massive issue, all on its own. It's that the problem will exist on some, and not on others. So people will feel like they made a mistake.
---
Yeah.. the person you replied to said "in MoP"
---
Better to be Chicken Little than sit back and let something ruin the game. It’s ok to not kiss Blizzard’s ass 24/7 you know.
---
I keep thinking it's on tuesday but then remember it's monday and get happy.

Layering is basically sharding, but it extends across the entire continent. It limits the number of people that you can potentially see at any given time to those who are on your layer. It makes it to where 50,000 people can be logged into a single server, but they are all layered into shards that only allow them to directly interact with those on their layer. So, say 100 people is the upper limit for layers(it’s obviously going to be higher, this is just for example.) If 99 people on your layer are in Elwyn forest, that means you will be the only person you see in stormwind, even if there are other layers where the reverse is true with 99 people in Stormwind. Without layering, you’d be able to see all 200 people.
---
I loved this from the moment I saw it
---
Banks open bb!
---
Well you immediately put me against you. You need to take a chill pill.
---
Go back to the ruined community and single-player game that is retail for the love of azeorth...
---
The truth is, layering will remain for as long as it is needed. That's why we haven't been given a timeframe. Suddenly, not as many people will leave as they first thought, and so they will need to keep it for longer, or people will leave immediately after 1 or 2 days, and they'll remove it then.

That isn't low layering works, you're asking for sharding. Layering encompasses an entire continent, sharding encompasses areas.
---
Yep. I changed my steam name to "killing time till wow classic" and yet Dota 2 is just boring now.
---
The problem now is that people are avoiding thalnos. So while it may just be 6%, that number is most certainly going to grow. More Brazilians will realize it's a good place to roll, while more NA will learn to avoid it.
---
Your mentality is what produced bfa, gj
---
You are right. Most people don't know what they are talking about because they never have ever played vanilla before, so they don't know what's the content about in p1.
---
This is why I am asking :)
---
Phrases might land you in a conversation you then have to backpeddle out of, just speak English, I can confirm that most Scandinavian players prefer to speak English anyway
---
Hell yeah
---
If you pick a PvP server then you get the consequences that come with choosing it. Simple as that. If you don’t want to be killed in the open world go PvE.
---
Literally going to watch streams just to watch them get ganked
---
This. I hate &lt;Pirates of the Pancreas&gt; with a motherfucking passion, but I'd sacrifice my first world epic to them if it mean I could watch them ass-raping an angry mob of streamer groupies around their King.
---
Discord exists lol
---
There were so many more problems that arose from attempting sharding in the lower level zones that people were disliking. As for the end of layering, it will depend on how long people play for and what the population is like in 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months. If the population on these servers stays very high you could see layering passed phase 1. They have said they hope to have it disabled by then but in the end if you are having 30k people login in every night into one of these servers it will likely stay enabled.
---
Did he get unbanned?
---
Checks out
---
Blizz wants to save money in exchange for your experience.
---
What's the difference between multiple layer on one server or multiple layers?
---
I think the perception thing is a moot point
---
At the end of the day, I want to play with as many players in an area as possible. This is why no matter what, layering won't sit well with me.
---
Realm merging is the only answer (if action is required) - regardless of perception or whatever
---
Why would people insist on "stealing" a streamers name? It makes absolutely no sense at all. It's people like that who are part of the problem. If Blizzard gives them special treatment, it's your fault, not theirs. All this toxicity around streamers is really getting old.
---
Not when name reservations happen and all the other servers immediately pop up with "this server is likely to have queues" as Blizzard said they'd be telling people.
---
Nope
---
I never said he was serious, just calling out a fanboy where I see one
---
Is there any proof of this?
---
I got luna party frames working, change the profile to anything BUT default profile and it shows up.
---
Sorry but you’re just objectively wrong.  All the different examples of layering show it fucking over important aspects that made WoW special to those of us who are upset.  
---
If there is not a cohesive world and community the game is DOA for many of us.  
---
They’re nothing they’re holding back - they have like two weeks.  This is what is ready for us, and it does not work.  All of the noise is totally justified.  
---
If you don’t understand that then please fuck right off back to retail where you belong.
---
by phase 2 it will already be too late. first impressions are everything when it comes to MMOs.
---
The problems that people are ignoring were always there. People are looking at the short game when they do talk about wanting no layering, no sharding, etc. Blizzard is being smart, looknig at issues that have arose during the 15 years of retail WoW and coming up with a solution that addresses all of those problems better than they did in the first 10 years.
---
Cross roads was packed today during stress test.
---
SO THE SERVER BECOMES TOTALLY UNPLAYABLE.  WHAT A GREAT PLAN.
---
yeah i personally just reduced the "ground clutter" and was perfect for me
---
They tried doing it a few xpacs ago but it didn’t work well so they scrapped it.
---
Getting good at pet manipulation. That's what it's all about.
---
“expansion content”. Outside of warmode BFA zones are not CRZs.
---
&gt; How dead do you really think Classic will be after 2 months? This sub only has ~169k users, and if that's the majority of players then there'd hardly be more than 300k Classic players in 2 months
---
Yes, I'd say those numbers are if anything optimistic. I don't think they're too low at all
---
It’s today, the 12th, opening at 6pm EST.
---
Well, you're entitled to your opinion. Either way, it won't matter a month after release.
---

Level the mage first. Warrior will be slow and tedious. The mage can hit cap fast and begin things like gold farming/raiding/pvping while you work on the warrior. A max lvl mage can funnel him gold for gear/skills/mounts and make the levelling less painful. Portal gold ftw.
---
It's in 17 hours
---
Boohoo, no, they should not have special treatment.
---
Thanks. If it's in the game at launch then I'll add it.
---
oh my god that video was pure sex
---
Well, I'm not going to search the thread for your vaguely relevant to my question response, especially after your uncalled for rudeness.
---
people tend to be way more on the edge when playing dota compared to wow. the game is way more competitive and frustrating and thus the reactions are way more extreme. i doubt it will reach the same level of madness in wow.
---
Just remove layering. It is a solution to a problem that didn't even exist. I am a software dev and this is a common problem among inexperienced and/or stupid developers. Wasting resources to fix a theoretical problem that doesn't even exist in the real world. This stupid ass development path can literally takes months to a year to find a solution that is equal to or slightly worse than using the simpler solution using existing tried and true tech.
---
I'd there was only 2 servers to chose from sure. If one of them is medium or low pop you're going to question why that is the case. 
---
"Oh good this one is low pop while allll of the other ones are massively overpopulated. Nothing wrong with that at all. I'd better do absolutely no investigation into this randomly amazing thing that happened"
---
Is that official?
---
i shopuldve mentioned i dont want it as a permanent thing just when starting out and dropped off when the player hits like 30 or something
---
I highly doubt it. Previous expansion launches would skip the first maintenance day if the release date was on Mon/Tues. Of course unless there is an actual need for it.
---
Probably the US PVP server
---
You don't need to spend $60, only need the sub to play Classic.
---
Hah... before I logged off for good at about 3AM PST Friday I gave away everything in my inventory to the first random guy I came by that could use it. I spent the entire day making white sets of crafted leather for everyone.
---
I guess everyone has different priorities.
---
The 12th in na. The same time the game launches in your region is the same time character creation goes live for your region.
---
We don’t know how many people per layer. We don’t know if dead capital cities is an unintended but necessary side effect. Phase 2 is months out, that means the entire leveling experience will be plagued by whatever issues layering has, giving an extremely un vanilla like experience. One of the biggest selling points of classic is its persistent world. Layering completely contradicts this core principle of the game. 
---
It’s a bad solution to a problem that may or may not occur on a time frame that isn’t even laid out.
---
No, the server becomes a streamer server and the rest of us can play without dealing with all the bullshit associated with streamers.
---
I had heard those were the only 2 places they hosted servers now, but my source is just a random person.
---
ElvUi has one baked in.
---
My bird who's American recommended it. I had never considered it either, but fuck me it works. 
---
Cheers!
---
Why don't streamers want to reveal where they are playing? All their cancerous followers will figure it out Day 1 anyway. They could at least let the rest of us have a heads up.
---
They said Mists of Pandaria content, they didn't say "from here on out"
---
We also turned it off for easier herbing and to remove some clutter.
---
didn't work for me. extracted into my classic addons folder...am i missing a step?
---
This one brought me back.
---
Soupasoka is one of the mods, go check the list of mods for the sub lol

That whole label is absurd. People define "drug" by what's legal and what's illegal, and it makes no sense whatsoever. A drug is something that alters your consciousness, plain and simple. Coffee does this, tobacco does it, alcohol does it. It does not matter at all if they're illegal, they're fucking drugs. While tylenol is techincally a drug, obviously, it's not considered 'doing drugs' because it doesn't alter your consciousness. But taking, say, Benadryl is using a drug because it alters your consciousness (I'm not talking about high doses which is a full-on deliriant trip), albeit in a mild way.
---
Not to mention that we typically define what drugs are socially acceptable and 'okay' to be using by what's legal. It's fine to get wasted every weekend (and even strangely encouraged in our culture), but it's not okay to get stoned or use other illegal drugs which are usually no more harmful than alcohol? Alcohol is actually one of the most harmful drugs, yet it's the one that's socially acceptable, literally JUST because it's legal.
---
People have anti-drug propaganda drilled into their heads so hard because of the failed War on Drugs that no one seems to realize the massive hypocrisy surrounding the way drugs are viewed. 
---
All you need to see is [this image](https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1501752959535.jpg)
---
I was considering putting a link to your spreadsheet at the bottom of the Mage tab. Do you want me to?
---
This is literally the exact same thing as layering except without having to merge severs.....what's the big difference?
---
Yes especially if you are leveling with friends it will make the Warrior much more enjoyable and efficient.
---
Oh wow, good catch. Excellent work. I updated the OP again to correct for it. The simplest way is to reduce "showtooltip" to just "show" since you only need the icons for clarity rather than cooldown or tooltip information. I can probably come up with another way to save space later.
---
I wonder if macros in Classic will run without line breaks. I always assumed they couldn't, but that'll be something to test.
---
I picked 6 months+.
---
To be fair, I plan to spend a LOT of time just chilling... as a holy paladin....... slowly autoattacking my way through the world :)
---
Wrong.

You’re joking right?

OG vanilla, only real tanks were prot warriors.

I love bear tanks, but that’s just how mafia works

---
Yes, there are only two AT&amp;T data centers Blizzard uses in NA. But they don't put all the PST servers in the Los Angeles one and they don't put all the EST servers on the Chicago one. You could live in California, choose a PST realm, and still have to connect all the way to Chicago. Just because a realm matches your timezone doesn't mean you'll have the best ping.
---
What's the big difference? Assuming a layer is the same size as a server? I don't see any.
---
You are almost right. Layering is sharding with continuity between zones. In WoW you can go from one zone to another and have a something infront of you disappear. In layering there is continuity between zones so changing zones means that the shard for zone a has the same population as the shard for neighbouring zone b
---
Lol what? I’ve never seen empty cities close to launch on any reasonably large pserver launch. In fact seeing the bustling activity each first time I go into the city is one of the reasons I became so interested in legacy realms to begin with.
---
Idk man its been smooth sailing for me and ive been on for a while. I think everyones overblowing it. Its only gonna be around fir phase 1 as well.
---
You do know you could invite each other right?  Instantly see each other.

The blue post on the forums tells you the time for you. The time in white is YOUR time.

---
So why exactly are you going Golemagg?
---
&gt;Swiftly was banned for causing a server wide DC once.
---
That's hilarious.
---
&gt;Bashiok comments on Swifty ban:
---
&gt;We recently monitored a situation where a large number of players intentionally disrupted access to multiple realms by gathering together and mass-spamming game emotes. In some cases, individual players spammed an emote upwards of 30,000 times.
---
&gt;As a result, some accounts found to be active participants in this activity were permanently banned. Upon further review, we have made the determination to reduce some of these permanent bans to temporary suspensions. We're currently in the process of identifying all offenders who acted to purposefully disrupt game service and will administer proper action to each participating account.
---
&gt;We're dedicated to providing a fun, stable, reliable gameplay environment for our players. While an exception was made in this case, accountholders who intentionally participate in events that contribute to realm instability will be subject to significant account actions, up to and including a permanent vacation from the game.
---
&gt;Please keep discussions related to this action within this thread. Related discussions outside of this thread will be locked, deleted, and/or fed to Murlocs.
---
&gt;Have fun and please remember to play responsibly.
---
We aren't exactly certain where the streamers are going. I would imagine some of them will roll on the same server, while others won't. 
---
Avoiding streamers isn't as necessary as avoiding BR. You can talk to a streamer, or a fanboy. It's a lot harder to form groups with people who don't even speak the same language.
---
nice! only downside is that it takes away 1 bag slot.
---
I saw someone with one the other day, how did this happen? Any clue??
---
do a /who on the stress test. 50+ people yet you see 3-4 max. The mental gymnastics of denial you guys are doing is really something.
---
Interesting. Not sure what kind of macros you're created though. Care to share and explain?
---
I said in the post above that some of the gear sets are over the cap, and not to go over the cap on your character. I decided to put the top gear up and count on the player to know not to follow it exactly. I'll edit the post to make this clearer.
---
I was there, alliance rogue.  Was a lot of fun, come on back anytime
---
Not sure what you mean by that but sure.
---
mind sharing/pming the totem macros?
---
There were 15 thex memes on the front page, and I had my post showing off a loot management system removed due to it being "low effort" because the name of the character I used to show it off was thex.
---
RemindMe! 16 days
---
What do you predict for how many players for the first week or two of launch? 
---
I don’t have any data to back up that I think it would be more than your estimate, just assumed it’d be a fair bit more (I figured still easily 500k players 2 months out, maybe as much as 1m if things go well)
---
There is an option between Chicken Little and kissing Blizzard's ass.  It's called remain calm, and see what happens.
---
I think it's pretty stupid to analyze the population of a city when using a level 15 capped stress test realm and a realm that has been open for a long time as contestants.
---
Why do people hang out in cities in WoW? Mostly because they're currently waiting on something or just have nothing to do. Or they're training profession skills, selling on the auction house, etc.
---
All this stuff isn't really relevant for level 15 and below. You don't really need to hang out in a city to look for a group for a dungeon, because at best, you can do deadmines. You also don't really need to sell stuff on the AH, because most players don't really have gold anyways. 
---
I played the whole weekend, and I never idled in a city. Why would I? There's stuff to test, levels to acquire, no time to stand around in ironforge. I mostly tested out some classes and leveled them to 10, and I'm sure most people did the same.
---
I think the emptiness of ironforge is mostly due to this, not because blizzard created one layer for each person in IF.
---
What I'm saying is that what if I'm on a streamer free server and I have been for 2 weeks now. I'm already level 60. Now I have to reroll on another server because mr big streamer decided to roll on my server 2 weeks after launch?
---
/facepalm.  
---
Do a search next time before you post.  
---
It is getting ported. Tukui is already ported.
---
so you just change the definition of the word to suit your needs? it's absurd
---
This is ridiculous, I was just on Barov and it was booming. Dozens if not hundreds of players in Northshire and storm wind. I honestly  couldn’t get away from them. It made finding object spawns harder to find. But I still loved it none the less. The player numbers don’t worry me at all.
---
he’s discussing a game on a discussion board. the game has a giant flaw. and he’s discussing it. no issue with that.
---
I couldn’t care less if you are “against me” I’m interested in facts and he is incorrect.
---
Dude you can play wherever you want get over yourself. Did you see the survey for thalnos anyway? It has 6% Portuguese speaking players. That's not counting all the normal players that aren't on reddit 24/7 taking polls. They can only pick one of the two left eastern servers. Just pick the other if you don't want to run into a Brazilian every 20th player.
---
WTS invite to asmon layer 1000g

fuck yeah 52 ms!

---
THE MAJOR CITIES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF IF BLIZZARD MAKE MORE SERVER OR USE LAYERS CONSIDERING THEY SAID THAT A LAYER IS ROUGHLY EQUAL TO A SERVER SIZE
---
why is nobody understanding that? The stresstest was not a proper representation of layer sizes.
---
From what I understand of the technology, this would be very difficult to do without going back to sharding. Layering is making a whole new instance of the entirety of azeroth, not just the zone you are in.  You'd have to have essentially an additional layer for the major cities that is completely separate from the current layering system.  Im not saying it's impossible,  but probably would take more development than they have time for before release.

Any half decent player is not going to uphold a blacklist created by a streamer.
---
I'm confused. The top streamers already said Blizzard pre-reserved their names.
---
So Blizzard doesn't consider Esfand big enough to reserve his or something?

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cp7pas/west_coast_pvp_or_rppvp_server_inhabitants_aka_my/). 
---
That does not solve the issues in the long term. That is a solution for your problem today. Blizzard has looked back at the last 15 years and went what were the mistakes in the first 10 years that lead to us having 250ish realms NA with 90% of them being dead wastelands and 10% of the realms having healthy successful populations.......wait the issue is have 200 extra realms that they did not need. The solution of throwing more servers at it was a failed solution and I am happy Blizzard addressed their mistake and came up with a better one.
---
Yeah I can do that for my self if I want why the fuck not. I live in a legal state and I’m a budtender and that’s my view of it. It’s a medicine that helps people with a variety of different issues. It’s something I’m passionate about. To me it’s not a drug.
---
Tell that to people or guilds that lose names during a merge.  There ARE downsides, even if they don't apply to you personally.  A lot of people that care about a lot of different things play this game.
---
Accurate. They said no plans for post classic at this time. It depends on how classic goes and if the community wants it later down the road.
---
I was there when they arrived at sentinel hill.  I flew to SW, alerted the boys.  Then flew back.  Never noticed any layers.
---
Yup!  It's a price I am willing to pay but it's steep, especially before you have other bags.
---
Didn't they announce there would be a cooldown on layer switching or some shit, not too long ago?
---
Well there was some trouble completing quests, since so many players competed for the same mob kills. But that only lasted for a few days at the start of the server, iirc.
---
I thought we could join the designated Realms as of now for testing... So those available now are just for stress tests, when can we get initial access to the actual Servers?
---
I get it, layering has issues and isn’t a perfect solution to what a lot of people don’t even see as a problem. 
---
But all this outrage which is based off of the ironforge comparison article is stupid and pathetic. People can complain and give examples of legitimate problems and that’s fine, but being petulant children crying at the first opportunity to express how upset they are is just dishonest and disingenuous. 
---
Just to be clear, noise over the system in general is for sure justified, albeit overblown and exaggerated in a lot of cases. What’s fucking frustrating to see is the incessant need to create problems that aren’t there like that article. Along with your last paragraph aswell, it makes you look like a dishonest whining-for-whining-sake little kid.
---
Try to download the latest release that came out today :)
---
Destiny 2 bit it’s in a holding pattern til a big xpac drop
---
To those wondering why there aren't enough people in specific cities or zones, just /who to see who is there. /who is server wide, not by layer.
---
Esfand and MadSeason are my two favorite, really chill guys I'd like to have a beer with
---
somehow the mods are not so quick with deleting this layering thread.
---
I was always under the impression that your layer was your layer unless you got invited off of it. Turns out thats not how it works.
---
It was a pet you could get in vanilla that was mailed to you.  I guess it carried over from back in the day!
---
Old esfand PepeHands
---
&gt; If 99 people on your layer are in Elwyn forest, that means you will be the only person you see in stormwind,
---
Doing well, but I am not sure this is accurate.  I believe the server tries to throw some people from layer 1 into layer 2.  I am not sure what criteria it uses to do this, but we have seen it happen to people in the "layering gone wrong" videos posted here.   People in dungeons, or afk in sw would be ideal candidates though. 
---
On the stress server there's no one in SW, because there's no reason to be in SW.  In any given layer, for every person standing in SW there's a 100 outside doing something. So yah, SW will look empty.  Now, if they were using sharding instead of layering, then SW would look full.
---
BGs are cross realm so there's really no worry there.
---
Even if there were that many people it would be fine. Having a packed server and seeing everyone around is part of vanilla. It’ll thin out over a few days. It being busy is just part of being in the same world. Dynamic resplendent fix 99% of these issues anyway.
---
Because streamers think they can have special privileges on a pvp server, so godly men like these kick the streamer’s asses
---
This brings me some relief. These layering examples in the past few days on this forum has been killing the hype for me. I really hope this is true.
---
People do not understand how layering works. LAYERING IS NOT SHARDING.
---
🇩🇰🇳🇴🇸🇪
---
Brits have always been a blast. Can we add 🇬🇧?
---
You are correct!
---
I had a few American friends from a game before WoW so I decided to follow them when we moved over. I'm leaning more towards EU servers right now just because of raid times, otherwise I'd defo play NA personally. Your list is pretty spot on, latency was only an issue for me in arena, and usually averaged around 130ms.
---
Is there a limit to your ignore list? I would just ignore them one by one until it's peaceful.
---
This is much faster than grouping with them and then finding out they're useless.
---
Hell yea
---
People disappeared from in front of you in Vanilla all the time. Someone logged off, disconnected or accepted a summon........
---
I second this.
---
Does front stabbing still work for rouges?
---
Would require some addon. Ignore list is maxed at 20 people or something.
---
i don't blame people for wanting to gank them
---
Are you sure it's layering, did you /who orgrimmar? They could also just be doing more testing with low thresholds, which is exactly what they said they were doing.
---
Back in the day, it was very common. Checkout Hazzak in SW, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0VWJdE01M      and many others
---
People are being stupid when it comes to layering.
---
They don't seem to understand that if there are enough players for 3-5 layers then it also means there are 3-5x the number of players that consume those goods which will even itself out.
---
I'd rather have Layering for a few weeks than to have to deal with a re-name (due to my name being taken) if Blizzard decides to merge servers.
---
The people that complain about layering never offer an alternative solution to potential dead servers (and the server merge) which is exactly what some Devs said.
---
They complain without offering any viable solution.
---
Merge the servers.  Who gives a fuck?  It's better than this intra-server decohesion shit, which is _completely_ antithetical to what an MMO should be about.
---
Everyone liked that.
---
You pay 15 dollars per month, the streamers pay 15 dollars per month AND encourage many more people to do the same. Like it or not, they contribute more to blizzard's bottom line than we do.
---
I started drugs and am doing the exact opposite for classic WoW!
---
Yep and in single player games you can do quests super fast...
---
Still missing the point I see. Blizzard is launching a low number of servers to address the issues that would have happened 1-2 years from now. So yes they are playing the long game. More servers is the putting a bandaid on a shotgun wound, in the end it solves none of the issues down the road and only is going to create more.
---
Good, don't play. Come back when it's turned off.
---
Any major vanilla private server had pop increase up to BWL, it starts dwindling by a very small amount after that.
---
haha it's so fun to talk like a bogan amirite
---
God damnit, weren't they going golemagg? This is partly why i told my friends to go shazzrah.
---
it was always a fucky ps bug
---
Can you edit this comment now that you've been proven wrong.
---
There shouldn’t be any layering in cities
---
Ghost Wolf is an ability, not a mount. But yes it would be great if you could buy a ghost wolf mount from the mount shop. Fix your game blizz.
---
I don't care what he does. I'm not paying blizzard to make the game enjoyable for him.
---
they are probably tired after a full day of gestapo action.
---
I guess that helmet will stay away till a later phase if it is the crafted helmet from molten core (That BIS, expsensive one), like the crafted plate pants.
---
Outside of changing your elvui scale or moving your minimap, I'm not much help, sorry.
---
Yep, classic is destroyed, don't even play it, only play if/when layering is turned off.
---
Long time player from vanilla would know that you wont get mount at 20.
---
They haven't set a date yet, but know it is coming.
---
you're correct, I was wrong. sorry!!
---
Out of curiosity does he lives/plays in the US or EU?
---
Not so tiny...
---
That pic is from the last day of Nost vs stress test that is already 3 days old and barely anyone is still playing. Not even remotely close to a fair comparison but ok, LAYERING..... LOUD NOISES.... Am I doing this right?
---
There is an addon, BlockChinese, that a lot of people use on Illidan. I’m sure one can be made for Spanish or any other language.
---
&gt;His name is basically a brand at this point,
---
That also makes blizzard money.  That's the distinction here.  Streamers are advertisers that Blizzard isn't paying.  I see no reason anyone with a decent sized following shouldn't get "their" name reserved.  Anyone trying to take "Asmongold" isn't doing it because they want the name, they're doing to to deny Asmon his name.  
---
I don't really care either way, I'm going to reserve the names I want.  Twitch is literal garbage, but it makes Blizzard money.  They'll do whats in their best interest.
---
Buddy I bought WoW March of 2005 and just turned 30.
---
Sucks when a pserver does it better
---
Wow thats nuts. I used to like Esfand but after hearing this I'm going out of my way to steal his name on as many servers as I can.
---
Full on tryhard, OG_haptix is an insane mage in classic. Can't wait to watch the war between "known" streamer guilds and the Gods of classic who aren't known yet
---
You change servers or you don't. Life isn't fair.
---
hmm, that is interesting and good to know.  
---
So, if what you are saying is true, then everyone laying claim to servers are doin so under this misconception.  The Br want thalnos, because it's east.  The streamers and NA guys are fighting for herod, because it's labeled east too.
---
Bump for this thread. Blizzard needs to see this.
---
0/10 on this troll
---
Are you aware that Atiesh is spelled wrong on the survey?
---
Streamers will hate classic.
---
It is so easy to grief them even on retail. How many times does Soda or Asmon have to ask someone from chat to invite them to a group so they can phase over and avoid being harassed?
---
Classic doesnt have phasing, and layering is temporary. Streamers will be forced to live a life of being in a safe zone or instance 24/7.
---
Asmon might try to get some fans to roleplay as  bodyguards, but two rogues can easily ambush and kill them in a secone before fans can defend him. Even if fans can somehow protect streamers, their gameplay will be severly slowed down due to attempts to kill them and their own faction trolling them.
---
There is no escape. I give it a month before Asmon is back to mount/transmog farming on retail and Soda is variety game streaming.
---
He's trolling
---
I’ve played wow for years its always been level 20 for 60% speed mount nice try troll
---
Yeah but it was fun plus it gave an effective use for daggers while leveling
---
Which ones of these guilds will be the most dedicated(hc/semi hc)? Would love to know and get in touch with you! 🙂👍
---
You get your mount at 40 though.
---
I know this. But that doesn't mean that the same will happen to classic.
---
Wow vas a vastly more popular game that runescape ever was, along with the hindsight of what happened to osrs should allow blizzard to not repeat that mistake.
---
Losing people right away is not a fact if they handle the game properly and adapt to changes.
---
Because I love Classic WoW, which was made by a different company.
---
i did the same. 5 points is not much, so at least i helped others.
---
How so?
---
I think I figured it out. When you open Elvui, toggle anchors, and look for the Quest Frame box. You probably won't be able to move it left and right, but you can move it up and down.
---
Not a bug, the tauren herbalism racial had to trained somewhere, that is solid tauren gardenwork!
---
Ohh, that's interesting. I imagined there had to be some kind of add-on or macro to help. Either that or a thousand monkeys typing /who for each area...
---
Yep people won’t even make it to phase 2 because of this shit
---
^^^^^^
---
This guy doesn't understand what NSFW means.
---
They’d rather keep their precious names than compromise the integrity of the actual game.
---
Yeah but since he’s leveling with friends warrior makes more sense, while solo leveling a mage
---
It was the solution to the problem *you* raised. And no, the issue of names is not the only difference between servers and layers. Your logic with this last statement was basically "oh, well if the name thing can't be a problem we might as well have layers." Are you forgetting why the person you were responding to was advocating server merges in the first place? They weren't suggesting server merges because they wanted the name thing to become an issue - that was *your* objection, which was easily addressed.
---
Using buggy broken sharding as the solution means there won’t be any pop down the road though. Merges and overflow realms are commonplace in MMOs and the issues of this sharding  system have been made very obvious as the Stress Test has gone on.
---
I’d rather deal with crowding, Queues, and merges than a system that is known to be very buggy and damaging to the community.
---
No
---
HAHA  this is the most autistic thing i've read in a long time.
---
Original Collectors edition, no longer available.
---
^ As a Senior DevOps Engineer myself, I would like to point out that this person above me servers!
---
And if it is that bad we should definitely quit the game and hold Blizzard responsible for their decisions. Hell, BFA was (is?) fucking terrible and all you ever heard was "it's beta guys they will fix this". They didn't fix it. Took them almost a year to even have the game in an okay state.
---
The classic team seems like they have their shit together and I'm kind of banking my thoughts on that.
---
Modern?!! This is Classic!
---
afaik Classic is based on Wotlk. The server technology probably is the same they use on retail.
---
Yea man really important testing what would we do without knowing this. /s
---
Hello if I know, man. I really don't get it. They maybe just haven't decided yet.
---
How long will the server be open for us to reserve our names?
---
That always happens there...  Probably could log into retail, and that happens.
---
If you use the folder that says classic it won’t work. Have to open that folder and use the tukui folder.
---
Wait really? I didn’t know that they made this promise and broke it for retail. can you link a source for where they said sharding would be temporary?

Negatives are mostly pve related...sure there are better, but not everyone is a pve no-lifer with access to the latest phases top end loot. Especially if this was available phase 1 or  2 it would be hard to beat.

Who uses two handed weapons in pve anyway? Shaman/ret or fury two handed war - all off meta dps. Feral/hunter it's just a stat stick so won't discuss.

It has been confirmed that they were triggering layering intentionally to test the system during stress test. It probably won't be like that at launch, if it is then we can riot

The aussie post didn’t have her. I’m saying nz should claim her. They had their chance.
---
Yeah... one of the big reasons classic was so successful was because of the social aspect. 
---
Blizzard seems to think people only care about doing the content and just "seeing" other people run around.
---
Of course he wants problems. People love drama. There's a reason he has so many followers while people like Esfand who are nice about things only has a small fraction of followers.
---
was on an empty layer lol
---
This shit isn't going to happen forever. People have short attention spans. Launch will probably be like this, but it dies down. 2 Months after launch the difference between the "streamer" server and the normal server will be minimal.
---
That was a random post, from a random guy
---
The drop down is above the big Play button. You have to look for it
---
Listen here yeh little shit.  You kids and your twitch memes, dabbing on the poggers, whatever.  We had our own memes, and that was waiting in queue so we had something to bitch about once we logged in to barrens chat.  We had to live in fear of a random disconnect, internet wasn't too great back then, in which we'd have to wait for the queue again.  Do you even know what 56.6k baud sounds like?  Eeeeee urrrrr buriiirrrirrrr KHHHHHHHHHH rreeee TSHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

Also, I'll have you know I lost my virginity in my early 20s.  Good day.

I’m assuming until launch
---
That always happens there....  He got put in another layer.  The people in town are ideal candidates to move to another layer or shard, because there's no chance they're fighting shit.  The game dynamically moves people to different layers when it creates or removes a layer.  This is working as intended.
---
Same issue here. Maybe I'll switch it up and be a Tauren Shaman. But deep down I know launch day I'll be a Night Elf Druid.
---
Hi, /u/Hathos_

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cp7xk3/recruiting_guild_masters_for_faerlina_herod_and/). 
---
Yes, and that is another problem which doesn't help; people don't want to group up to finish quests (will likely not be a large problem with Classic though).
---
If layering makes it to world bosses, they will put something in to prevent layer hoping for kills. Likely what we see now in wow where it has a weekly lock out(or what ever the spawn time is)
---
small name alterations &gt; immersion breaking every hour and reduced community experience.

Layering is horrible. Leave it where it belongs, in retail.

You must not be very up to date on the state of botting in WoW. It's pretty much dead. The client code is obfuscated, full of traps that make scanning memory impossible, and Warden detects everything. Only botting on MacOS is even close to safe and there's just no one releasing anything anymore, paid, private, or otherwise.
---
THANK YOU
---
Pretty sure there has been nothing but hype and anticipation. Even a sub this negative thinks it will be successful, at least at launch.
---
"Capital cities are empty on a STRESS TEST. You know, when the entire point is to put as many people into an area as possible."
---
I think you misunderstood. The 'stress test' was to see just how much layering they could do, hence *why* it was empty.
---
lmao you're retarded
---
Spontaneous community encounters. Say you meet a guy and do a q at lvl 10. What would often happen is you run into him again later at 30, again at 40 etc. Makes for community friendships and identity. Now imagine the likelihood of that when both of you could be rotated around in 10-20 however ridiculously many layers we will have. 
---
Things like professions and resource scarcity is also at risk, as layering hopping can be used to farm rares for blues and profession nodes (like the rare black lotus etc).
---
I had the same issue in undercity. Using a 2080ti, everything on ultra.
---
Thank Ion. The worst game director WoW has ever seen.
---
Looks like a real savannah now. :)
---
Blizzard has never once merged servers in the history of WoW. They’re not gonna do it now.
---
Layering is in. Don’t like it? Don’t play. It’s a temporary solution to the initial overcrowding.
---
Also, in this stress test, the threshold for being layered was *deliberately* set extremely low for testing purposes.
---
Also also, layering is gone by the end of the first phase.
---
Also also also, please quit beating the dead horse.
---
A channel system, planned server merges with common naming pools, dynamic respawns only, a more limited version of layering, absolutely nothing.
---
Are those the default raidframes or did you use an add-on for that?
---
You're right about the priest being for heals. I believe guilds only want one S.Priest in raids.  
---
Warlocks probably have a build that is viable for PvE/PvP, and farming. I bet this is a class that requires the least respecs for doing everything well. I'm sure there are better specs for each specific thing you want, but if you aren't hardcore PvP and don't mind a few talents being a bit more PvE oriented, you'll enjoy it.
---
It was partially humor because of the screenshot and partially to complain about layering like everyone else.
---
But you don't know. You take numbers out if thin air and call it as facts.
---
Cool so what was your better solution?
---
Reeeee that’s not classic

nice

If I recall correctly food fish vendor for the same amount as the food of that level. So a level 1 fish would vendor for 1c just like tough jerky. The alchemical fish like oily black mouth and foreign snapper probably vendor for more. Best bet for vendoring crafting supplies is skinning.

Then you should learn patience.

No one from blizzard currently seems to care waht people ACTUALLY want.

---
I don’t think that’s how layering works. There will still be 50k players on the same server/realm just you won’t be able to see them. As player base reduces layers are scrapped off until all players are on the same layer. If there is a surge of players a new layer is created and new players will join that layer. It has nothing to do with the actual servers/realms.
---
Id 100% support class tuning (not to be confused with homogenization). Blizzard have made a ton of poor decisions but class and raid balance is something they've consistently done well. 
---
For me that wouldn't mean making all dps specs equal. Everyone will have a different opinion on how to best tune it so there'd never be community consensus. 
---
If it were up to me then pure dps classes (warlock, mage, hunter, rogue) would be the 100% dps benchmark. Warriors/Shamans/Priests 90% because they tank or heal. Paladins/Druids 85% because they tank&amp;heal.
---
Priests/Shamans would be the 100% heal benchmark. Paladins/Druids 90% heal. 
---
Warriors the 100% tank benchmark. Paladins/Druids 90% tank.
---
Apparently there is a notoriously guild called APES who are gonna roll on Golemagg so people tends to jump on Shazzrah. Spanish people who is also apparently known for only speaking Spanish and being rude ‘n toxic were first rumored to go to Golemagg too, but it seems like they’ve split into both. Nordic players have chosen to go Shazzrah, and it seems like UK are going there as well, so there should be plenty English speakers Shazzrah. So Shazzrah seems so far to be the best choice so far.
---
That's lvl 1 fam. The real objective is getting greater at 13 and that requires an alt
---
You should check out Skarm's video on bear tanking. He's something of a vanilla legend (cleared naxx on speedrun, tanked naxx as dual-weild warrior) and said he's rolling tauren druid for classic because it's totally viable.
---
*one S.Priest in raids*
---
If even one, and that one shadowpriest wont be DPSing in shadowform. They’re there for Shadow Weaving and then to heal.
---
what happens when two people share a character name
---
This whole things has devolved into massive amounts of cringe. 
---
Jesus christ, most streamers will hit 60 within the first week while all their followers are left lagging behind at level 20.
---
If your think they're going to have a horde of people following them around game at any point near the first few weeks of classic you have a special level of retard.
---
Most people will be too consumed with trying to level than pay attention to streamers, let alone follow them around in game (aside from main cities, I'll give you that).
---
Give it two months and half (if not more) of the playerbase will have already dropped off anyways once they realize that at level 45 they're only halfway into the XP grind to 60.

I'm just so sick of every other thread posting this shit.

Never too late to start gaming. I think mmos are actually really great mediums for relationships. My boyfriend and I met playing Diablo 3 many years ago. Since then we obviously live together now and have been playing mmos together ever since (raiding and whatnot)

That wasn't EU in general but French and German speakers who freaked out. I don't give a flying fuck if there are pockets of different communities on a server
---
farsight? how? and what's lb?
---
Lol what? Auto updating addons are amazing
---
that's part of their hunting strategy. A pack of Germans will seperate and a small part of the group asks for directions in german to create confusion while the other part spreads out and puts towels on chairs/beach chairs to claim them. After a sucessfull hunt they'll laugh and celebrate their victory by drinking hefeweizen
---
Blizzard don't merge servers, that's the problem. Your solution won't work because of it.

Any class can easily break joanas record in a competent dungeon group and you’re no where close to his record so I wouldn’t get my hopes up.

Asmond is like 85% going to pick a pve server. Soda is 98% going PvP. I wouldn't be laughing :P
---
youre the crazy one lmaooo
---
If it was on for a day or a week and only in the starting areas I would be less worried, but consider the server count we got and the amount of players that are gonna play. It’s 3 or 5k players a layer depending who you ask. It’s a million ish players for the EU region surely. It’s... it is 10 servers.  This shit will be on for a month minimum, prob more like 3 or 6. When it does get removed, that’s each of those little later communities (assuming much of anything forms) getting absorbed into a giant one. By then the economy is also rather ruined as layering has been abused to farm rares for blues and profession nodes. It risks ruining the core appeals of classic and I’d much much rather take the complete chaos, dead servers and whatever else than have layering.
---
Warlocks are unquestionably on of the best pvp classes. 
---
For pve from my understanding is they start competing with top dps in the tier 3 range. 
---
Shadow Mastery in affliction and Ruin in destruction is one viable raid spec. The other is Shadow Mastery and Demonic Sacrifice. There are more optimal pvp specs for warlocks but sm/ruin is solid.
---
Yeah its hard to find info on this, thanks for your opinion. I will.definitly save a name for both and thalnor for pvp server.
---
Yea for sure.
---
This is a business model guaranteed to fail. Numbers would consistently dwindle and having the community broken into 3 and then 4 parts would be difficult to manage.
---
Yeah, it will be nearly as competitive although there will probably not be as many PvE only guilds, so people might focus a little less on PvE stuff during downtime, or not, depending on your guild. But this probably shouldn't make any noticeable difference (in my experience), maybe its different for others. There will still be guilds pushing raids on consistent schedules and going for the best gear/grinding all the time and such.
---
+4K people from http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se[Nordic guilds](http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se)  just officially chose Shazzrah, so my friends and I are rolling on Golemagg!
---
And you’re basing this statement on what exactly? Your fortune telling abilities? Because when wow expansions launch on Monday they skip the weekly maintenance.
---
It's a difficult conundrum.
---
Hybrids only got *one* tier set per raid, so bonuses and stats always favored what most people played at the time. Most Paladins were holy back in the day (because ret/prot were constantly shit on) so Bliz itemized loot for holy. It was a feedback loop.
---
Bliz never (well, usually never) use expansions to re-create classes. That's why BC saw Druids become dope tanks and WotLK saw Pal become dope tanks. (Seriously - Paladin's got a taunt in WotLK and judging light would generate healing threat. It was insane.)
---
In retail, there are Flavor-Of-The-Month tanks that simply dominate. Like Monk is right now. But -- you can bet some top dollar that next expansion some other class will be the best tank. I'm not sure if that system of cycling in the "best tank" is good or not, honestly. But at least you know what you're buying with classic wow. Paladins can do whatever they want in 5man content and PvP - but they're healing in raids 95% of the time.
---
Yep, it should work. :)
---
I have read that the starting zone mobs have reduced dodge and parry and block. So if that’s true that might be what you seeing. You will also notice how little damage starting zone mobs do until they get to around 5/6.
---
Chill song does not fit with epic battle montage.
---
Thanks alot i suck at finding things, youre a life saver.
---
Nah it's not worth it at all. Just grab the vendor wands they give consistent upgrades till bfd if your slow leveling it.
---
The small but committed community of players on that server you just labeled dead is insulted.
---
"200+"
---
Its not about the constant phasing, its all the bugs that are present. Peple are mostly angry at getting layered randomly without joining a group
---
Yeah it's true. I don't wanna complain anymore at this point, I just wonder why they haven't merged servers in the past and won't do it in the future. When pservers can do it, a multibillion $ company should be able to do it too.
---
But yeah, they created this technology and there's no way around now.

It’s about the same as tbc, just a longer slog. Pick up a good wand, smite &amp; holy fire dmg talent, and it’s slow but steady going. Never played mage, but your choices here are very distinct.

Yes I have also noticed the reduced damage, do you know why this is?

This isn't the same game, they have rebuilt it with assets &amp; data from backups.

The time it takes to do that, including the time to corpse run, and the likelihood that you'll agro a mob when you get to the chest, suggests that you'd just be better of grinding some move, skinning them and selling the hides.

Should have rolled Horde. I spent the weekend practicing exploration runs and the horde zones were packed. When servers were fresh it felt like I saw at least 100 people in the Orc starting zone. Over the weekend every time I remade a new orc there were near 50 players still there. Senjin village had like 20 players, Ratchet had a couple, northern Barrens had some, every part of Durotar was well populated. Orgrimmar, Tirisfal Glades, Mulgore and Thunder Bluff had plenty of players. Hell I even passed by some people running past the thunder Kodo in Southern Barrens. Plus they set the player cap for layers really low and were probably manipulating it behind the scenes to test it so I highly doubt we will see issues come launch with population.
---
This is the reason all the capital cities are designed so that you can't easily see into them from the outside - to hide people disappearing when they cross the border. Notice that Stormwind, Orgrimmar, and Ironforge all have the same kind of entrance where you have to walk around a wall after entering the outer gate.
---
You just told me to check so I did, This is the OCE realm anyways so it's prime time.
---
It is supposed to let people share their ignore lists basically I think. So hypothetically a streamer could give the list out to all his subscribers or even viewers. It seems like it would break the ToS but idk how they would disable its api functionality
---
That was side-effect of merging (or "connecting") realms from different time zones.  Originally, all the realms were in the proper datacenter for their time zone.
---
Dunno if it means that much to them tbh. I would have done the exact same thing in their shoes. Rather try to do the first few levels as peaceful as possible if that’s an option. 
---
Streamers also garners a lot of traction and advertising to classic, so better just take the good with the bad. Can always reroll another server early on.
---
leeway/deadzone stuff is awful for hunters.  Warstomp is good, sure, but stun res with no leeway fuckery is far better.

That or you aren't as good at reading people as you think you are. You prob just shrug of sociopaths as dry humor too. :p
---
The word is hyperbole &amp; yeah... it's not a good thing..
---
Need a source on this. Because too many times have gamers sat idly by, then later burned. Because of "it's just a beta/test" reasoning, then it's suprise when the live version is the same. You have to assume it will be the same unless explicitly said so officially.
---
Many games have gone awry because of this leniency, and it's how our very own BFA  became known as Beta For Azeroth. 
---
Not making that mistake again.
---
Had this issue as well. It’s for anyone running shadows on ultra settings.
---
I was saying layering and sharding, because I said it happens all the time there.   In retail, it's probably sharding.  In classic, it's layering.   
---
I already explained to you what was happening.  I'll try again.  
---
Let's say the cap for a layer is 100 people.   This isn't how it works really, but for this example it's good enough.   The 101st person logs in.  What happens?   You probably think that 101st person goes into layer 2 all by himself, right?   Kind of makes sense, but that's not what happens.   What actually happens is the server pulls people from layer 1, and throws then into layer 2 with the 101st person, so he isn't all alone.   People in town are ideal for throwing into a new different layer, because they're not fighting something.
---
I am sure you've seen the "I got layered videos", right?  Well, the same thing is happening there more or less.   The server is trying to stay balanced, and the wrong people are getting caught in the crossfire.
---

&gt; On level up, the message: “Your skill in Protection increased to 15” was added in 1.12.1, and we’re intending to keep that.
---
It will work
---
But just note that once you delete it, he will need to claim it quickly as it will be open for grabs
---
it's not  feelings based, it's a fact. wow is turning more and more into a slot machine mobile game and less like an mmorpg with every patch
---
Back in the day Athene and Swifty got banned for encouraging people to join servers and crashing them didn't they? Seems like streamers should be held accountable for encouraging their community to ruin servers or grief people.
---
You have the option to not hang out with shitty people and the ability to make new friends. This isn't rocket surgery.
---
Going to Org to do RFC, or train different weapons might be, that's the reason I ran into a city.
---
Honestly? It's up for debate. It's not like Alliance where dwarf is just hands down the best race for the class. It's a bit more about personal preference.
---
For PvP, if youre going to be doing it as a Shadow Priest and not Disc, then I would personally go troll. Shadowguard is just insane, it scales with spellpower, so it does quite decent damage, it procs Blackout, Shadow Weaving and Vampiric Embrace, as well as any "chance on hit" trinkets that you might have at the time.
---
It makes you actually able to deal with rogues or warriors, by either healing some of their opener, stunning them outright, or making your eventual retaliation do a lot more damage.
---
Which you kinda need, because it's a hard fight due to the lack of mobility sometimes.
---
They also have Beserking, which has a PvE use.
---
OR
---
Your other option is undead, which will give you one of the most broken racials in the game (WOTF). Humans have Perception and not EMFH at this point in Vanilla, which means undead is the only race which can really get away with not using a PvP trinket. Which is excellent when you have two spellpower increase trinkets, allowing for some horrific burst.
---
They also have an additional dot (Devouring Plague), which is nice, as well as some resistance against shadow (+10), which is good for resisting fears and fighting warlocks and other shadow priests. But...
---
TL;DR: Probably troll.
---
i know i will actively participate in ganking them.
---
Based NA Herodians. Whitemane shall honor and remember your valiant sacrifice.
---
I think it was more about the graphics.
---
couple more pictures in full album [https://ibb.co/album/kKwzBF](https://ibb.co/album/kKwzBF)
---
Need a source on this. Have they actually said it? Or is it assumed or heresay??
---
Because too many times have gamers sat idly by, then later burned. Because of "it's just a beta/test" reasoning, then it's suprise when the live version is the same. You have to assume it will be the same unless explicitly said so officially.
---
I just assume that’s to make it easier to get started I guess
---
Server merges are tangible evidence the game is "dying" even though they would be inevitable without layering. No way Blizz is going to make 100+ realms with plans to merge down to 20 - everyone would say the game is dead and the optics are terrible. Layering is opaque, we can't see exactly what's happening to population over time. We are talking about the potential for 1 million+ concurrent players minute 1. Within the first week the concurrent population will drop drastically as play time regulates and tourists start to leave. By the end of the first month, 1 million could be down to 200k or 100k concurrent.
---
its not like there aren't easy solutions to this.

Cheers. Just thinking about this worst case scenario I just re download classic if uninstalls it all

phasing
---
 . the relationship between the timing of two or more events, or the adjustment of this relationship 
---
what else do you call the process of a character teleporting from one instance of a server to another? it's called phasing in and out and it's the term people have used for it since vanilla wow when people would enter a teleport into an instance
---
I got the a problem too, I reported as a bug, hope they fix this for launch

---
Download the Blizzard client and download the classic wow client (the whole game).
---
You'll login to the game tomorrow and select your realm - and create a character. EzPz. 
---
I reckon it'll be one of those things where the client stays up until launch but the "Enter World" button is greyed out.
---
As a belgian i got real good memories about our viking friends, but very bad experiences with our casa de papelians. Very conflicting times indeed.
---
Yeah, you can't even answer my question.  Pathetic.  The reality is the "end of phase 1" is the most vague, disingenuous answer ever and you're maybe too stupid to realize it, and there's zero precedent for them keeping their word at any rate.
---
Have to remember that this platform might not be used by those age groups as much and will skew the result because of that. Majority of redditors in this subreddit might just be 25+. Interesting results nonetheless. Good work!
---
Even easier just join someone elses layer and it respawns instantly
---
100% agree! Yes those do not interest myself at all as well. Enough drama elsewhere and would rather not have it in gaming which I use to relax. That’s where it ends up being on moderators shoulders to foster the community, but I have to admit that it is hard to find a good solid community and keep it that way. Wishing you well too and enjoy Classic!
---
Was on an empty layer. Even asked to join but I guess the raid groups were full.
---
You won't be able to loot before you get aggroed and 1shot by whatever is nearby.
---
Server merge optics are terrible. Dead game.
---
What are you talking about? Do you know what test cases Blizzard were running during the stress test? These weekends have not been run to play exactly like live they are run to give Blizzard an opportunity to see how their software responds under different constraints and conditions.
---
The stv arena chest is good for this and the stuff vendors for a couple gold. You will however most likely encounter other people doing this on launch.
---
Maybe they re-added it? It's hard to say. 
---
My guess is Blizzard's 1.12 test client has the 1.12.1 changes and those messages exist in that client. (Just a guess, though.)

Can you tell me which server you're going to play? I want to avoid toxic players

It's okay, you can level up past that. I believe in you.

Already seeing people saying they’re holding off til layering is removed on k3
---
damn so lucky we dont have any streamers on our server/region.
---
would completely ruin it for me if i could not evade them
---
Shouldn’t make a house out of straw in this day and age
---
Layers has nothing to do with 70k ppl trying to log on to the same server.
---
Stress test had layers and we still had 10k queue until they opened up two new realms.
---
Layers aren't servers. If there are 10k people in que constantly layering doesn't do shit for them. Layers don't increase server capacity, just spread people out who already logged in.
---
Well thats just absolutely bullshit. If you actually played in the stress test, you would know what it was like. You had 25-100 guys trying to tag Sargath. But with the increased spawns made it still so that you could get XP and levelup easy. The test felt VERY good, you had competition for mobs, but it wasnt retardedly camped.
---
What ever they had going, it was working. With the increased spawns they dont need that many layers and can REMOVE the layers faster, because people spread out in the world quicker.
---
Anyways, what do people expect them to do 2 weeks before the launch ? Compeletely rework the server system, when servers are announced, name reservation is in 16 hours.
---
This article is such a gigantic clickbait/troll.
---
Multiple streamers were casting during the stress test and showed massive numbers of players in the same area almost the whole time...
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/464326100?t=02h52m15s
---
Doesn't take much to figure out this article is ridiculous. There was nothing wrong with the layering limits during the stress test.
---
So much speculation.
---
I don't understand your proposed scenario.
---
You start in humanoid form. You have an 8m melee range. You auto-attack or use a melee ability from 8m away, and it resolves.
---
You shift to cat form. Now your melee range is 5m. Your next auto-attack gives the error "Target is out of range." You have to step forward to keep attacking.
---
How are you planning to carry over the range advantage?
---
I don’t understand what people want from these streamers they hate so much lmfao. This whole sub 2 weeks - 2 months ago was saying how fucking ridiculous it was that streamers weren’t planning on telling people what server they were on, and were going to ruin the launch experience trying to avoid them.
---
Fun fact - Layering cannot by definition kill classic. If enough people quit, it's no longer needed.
---
Did you even ask for vanilla? GTFO
---
We don't need layering. We don't want layering. Layering is toxic as it separates PEOPLE. Go back to retail if you like phasing in and out so much.
---
This reply made my day lol
---
Saying it's not THAT big a deal is super subjective. If I lost my character name due to a server merger, I'd be so beyond upset I might actually just quit playing. Yes, my characters identity is that important to me.
---
take pictures every month of yourself naked, starting today.
---
will keep you motivated if youre not a disciplined person.
---
Beating a dead horse for a very real issue when the game is about to launch in 2 weeks? You sound like a blizzard apologist. 
---
That they don't want to is a shitty reason not to do it.
---
You have the game in the first place because americans.
---
Brutally honest? I've watched a view video's to get some information, sadly it had to be him cause YouTube is just as fluxed up nowadays with algorithms, you can't find your funny accent guy who has 100% knowledge anymore. he is like layered under 100's of other vid's even ones that don't even have the same subject.
---
back to the point, in his video's he states he has a view on a subject but gets corrected/contradicted by donations or a blue post, and suddenly he is 180 and has a new opinion, he is just a fraud.
---
Do the Scarlet Crusade understand the difference between the scourge and The Forsaken?
---
I get why they’re adding layering and I think it’s reasonable to expect it in starting zones. However, I disagree with how it’s used in cities and higher level areas. It ruins the Vanilla feel and like some have said, leveling is a big part of the game and an important one in meeting guilds and making friends. Layering may impact this and turn it into a shitty experience.
---
I was just in a layer by myself and 200 people were in another layer fighting Alliance. Pretty fucking annoying.
---
If you care about immersion I dont see how occasional people appearing or disappearing (also happens with logging in and out!) is worse than being forced to rename your character in an RPG
---
That picture is rad. Did you create it?
---
A few days later, yes. After Athene stepped in and tried to milk the situation as much as possible. The two began playing together for a bit and that's how Athene got the Razer sponsorship.
---
I’ve been pushing for official vanilla servers for over 6 years lol. If you don’t believe me you can check my post history on reddit. You’ve clearly never played vanilla If this is your mentality. Starting zones were built for 50-100 people, not 1000-2500 people.
---
&gt;ToS
---
Wait don't the stream snipers gather mobs to just focus on the streamer... It's literally the exact same thing you're talking about, but worse. The streamers usually do it to speed up their grind or for content, but you're all doing it out of extreme malice and jealously. That's kinda weird dud
---
If they don't remove layering you can expect the uproar to be so massive that they'd be fucked.
---
Having a fresh install of ElvUi is very technical for most people and starting from the base it can take hours upon tedious hours to set up and make everything right.
---
What you describe is sharding. Layering is supposed to work different as it's a virtual scale for a realm. A layer is not supposed to change when they zone. A layer is supposed to change upon group invitations or dungeons to re-match players on the same layer. It's continent based, not balanced based upon popularity within a zone.
---
Its 8.0 clie t so its bfa not wotlk
---
They won't quit saying "Fuck layering", they'll quit saying "Where is the 'community' everyone talked about?" not realizing they are quitting because of layering.
---
willitclassic.com has links to most available classic mods.
---
You think they can just add 1  or 2 servers and turn off layering?   No. 
---
You would need  to take the number of servers and multiple by at least 5.  That might  handle the initial influx of players.   However, the attrition rate will be like 80% by phase 2.   Meaning that 8 out of 10 people will quit or become inactive within the  first few months.   But it won't take months for problems to arise, the lower pop servers would be dead within a matter of days.
---
I can understand the frustration, negativity is rarely fun. For my part tho I find it encouraging and refreshing that people are addressing issues and worries. If this games gonna be all it could be then we need to be adamant and vocal about our wishes for it, as while there are some passionate devs on the team, there are definitely also some corporate filth that cares nothing for the game and would happily make it into another mobile like mtx game.
---
"demand" lol
---
Norway is not a part of EU ethier, so we gotta remove their flag too then!
---
Layering will kill classic.
---
Most of these options are clearly worse...
---
Layering is certainly not a correct solution, it's not even a solution. Even if it works exactly as described, it's still devastating to the community.
---
How do I go about finding a guild for horde Myzrael?
---
what's the main thing that happens at 30?
---
I have had issues with this for about a year now.  Takes ages and will lag out a few times before I can get it to work.
---
  That always happens there....  He got put in another layer.  The people  in town are ideal candidates to move to another layer, because  there's no chance they're fighting shit.  The game dynamically moves  people to different layers when it creates or removes a layer.  This is  working as intended. 
---
Let's say the cap for a layer is 100  people.   This isn't how it works really, but for this example it's good  enough.   The 101st person logs in.  What happens?   You probably think  that 101st person goes into layer 2 all by himself, right?   Kind of  makes sense, but that's not what happens.   What actually happens is the  server pulls people from layer 1, and throws then into layer 2 with the  101st person, so he isn't all alone.   People in town are ideal for  throwing into a different layer, because they're not fighting something.
---
I  am sure you've seen the "I got layered videos", right?  Well, the same  thing is happening there more or less.   The server is trying to stay  balanced, and the wrong people are getting caught in the crossfire.  But  this is a bug, and shouldn't be happening.
---
I dont think everyone that's going to play classic is actually going to play the stress test, myself included. I'm definitely saving myself for official release. This article seems like it's written by a panicked hardcore player that probably has nothing to worry about.
---
Yeah I don't understand this sentiment either. Their lack of advertising does make it more uncertain, though.
---
I love Scandinavians enough where I'm probably going to pick that server anyway, since my private server and retail experience involves a lot of them.
---
Without coordination we crushed them!
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Faerlina is most likely streamer server
---
What is the server limit when layering gets taken away? In vanilla is was 2500 per server I think. Are the 100,000s of players competing for those slots?
---
I'd have to boycott the vast majority of companies on the planet if I followed that philosophy.
---
If everything Blizzard states was trustworthy, there wouldn't be a problem. People are concerned about this not being the case and for good reasons.
---
I surely hope Blizzard has a couple of realms up their sleeves that they can add quickly during launch week, and they just didn't mention it. Otherwise layering is going to be here to stay.
---
All while I was sitting in another layer hoping I’d get phased in.
---
I really enjoyed having APES on my server on nd.... Makes sure pesky hordes just get obliterated everywhere you go. I legit never got ganked in brm besides a few suicide aoe mages

---
Oh. Well good to hear. I had just assumed the arms race between bots and anti-bot software was still going on.
---
I would happily take a delayed release and pay triple the sub if it meant more servers with no layering aye. It’s definitely gonna mess with the community aspect. People will shout me down over long Qs and dead servers, but neither of those scare me off half as much as layering.
---
Something like sending an auto-attack command in humanoid form at 8 meters, and shifting right away before it resolves.
---
Would it be possible under current batching system? Or the shapeshift command will be executed in the separate batch no matter what?
---
In a focus of grinding, how can I use layering ?
---
I farmed a spot, I invite someone anywhere in the world, I get phase in another "layer" where the mobs are still here, I quit and I grind again ?
---
Not enough years it appears.
---
I mean, it's two weeks. You'd think that the thresholds get higher and higher with every test and by the last stress test they are already in a state to simulate the end product, wouldn't you?
---
This is what we will get on launch. You'll hard pressed to convince me otherwise.
---
"don't worry it's just alpha, beta, just released" etc...
---
Unbreak/fix the spawn rate system to actually be dynamic, easy.
---
I'm gonna guess that a lot of the people doom-saying layering did not play the stress test on Friday when it went up. 
---
I made an Undead character and the first few quests: kill skeletons (about 10 or 12 spawns), kill a named NPC and get his head, and collect supply boxes around the starting zone (of which there are only maybe 10 or so on a 2 min respawn timer) were totally unable to be completed because of how many people were on the same layer; it was a madhouse of people literally running around in circles, and after an hour of trying to get the 3 introductory quests done (couldn't tag enemies quickly as a mage, even trying to melee them but you start with a slow 2H stick), I gave up and logged out
---
I was able to get back on today thanks to the extend test time they gave us, but otherwise that hour of running the starting zone doing basically nothing would've been my entire test experience.
---
I played from Vanilla thru Cata, and I'm well acquainted with new content launches and player overcrowding, so it's more or less what I expected. I doubt a new player, or perhaps a player coming over from retail, will find it to be as entertaining. I'd argue there's a good chance that they will give up around the same point I did and never come back to see what a great game Classic can be.
---
Why should you have be "fighting" everyone on the same side as you just to get simple things like quests done? Contesting valuable resources for professions, world bosses, or a popular farming spot? absolutely - but it really defeats the purpose of even having any early zone quests in the first place if you're not going to be able to complete them due to having 100 other people there all at the same time. Arguing that "that's just the way it was" doesn't hold water anymore, they've implemented some very small QoL things that make sense and weren't in Vanilla; layering isn't even going to be a permanent thing.
---
All the doomsayers crying over their loss of immersion will get over it and layering will be gone before the Honor system is implemented, so you can still have your epic Tarren Mill battles to your hearts content.
---
Layering is going to be fine and will only last in P1 as announced - you all are overreacting hardcore
---
6pm est is when it happens, not sure about your time zone but you got like 15 hours as of the time I posted this.
---
Haven't seen any drama around Whitemane, my #1 choice at the moment. East Coast is a streamer free for all and Asmongold may not join the dedicated 'streamer server.
---
Classic based off of a code branch around 8.0. Then modified a bit for some classic specific things. 1.12s dont work at all, I tried.  Some 8.0 mods kinda worked out of the box, but most need small tweaks. willitclassic.com has a list of most mods with a classic specific version.
---
That comparison dude wtf 😂😂 I don't know what you just said but I agree.
---
I don't think you realize just how bad it will be without layering. Even with grouping, it would take hours to do a single quest in the 1-5 starting zone.
---
If they don't fix the layering, I'll say goodbye to Classic....
---
This sounds a little like the "It is alpha, give it time!" meme.
---
I am in the same boat, I keep thinking I will switch to Horde etc, but another part of me thinks the nostalgia of leveling my NE Druid will be worth sticking with it. I have one of every class at least above 100 on both horde and alliance in retail, but my first character back in 2004 was a NE Druid and my second was a gnome mage. I think I might be doing the same thing again.
---
&gt;You can't see the problem of not being able to talk to ~10% of the server you are on, when there's an option where that isn't the case?
---
Honestly I cant see it. Sure it would be nice if they stuck to mostly english on world chats but the occasional guild recruitment or something is not gonna be a problem.
---
On some pservers there were a bunch of languages from france to russian and the occasional chinese goldfarmer. I'd say they did make up more than 10% of the playerbase back then and cant say they caused problems. They still knew tosheep the moon and so forth even if we lacked a common tongue.
---
What is this dude? 12?
---
Yeah i was thinking about all the trolls racing to mess with them. I personally dont really understand the impacts because they never streamed back when i played, but i was just curious.
---
No, you would use wide namespaces for multiple servers. So for example 10 servers would share the namespace. Then they would merge 5 into one server and 5 into another. In another case when some servers were still huge, they would merge 3 into one and the other 7 into another, or all 10 into one if it's the worst case scenario.
---
This way you would have room to make the merges in any case.
---
Seems like each post on here switches between hating or defending layering. Really unfortunate as I do believe there are some genuine concerns, but since it’s a shouting match most places or a 1 sided upvote/downvote fest there is little changing people’s minds.
---
I played vanilla. Its fine as long as its phase 1 only. People need to chill and focus on the good stuff (basically anything else)
---
I heard that Blizzard will send a notification if a server will have a HIGH population (a lot of name reservations) but idk if you will be able to see pop nummers between factions on a server
---
yea, he's right.
---
This post is absolute nonsense. The first screenshot is comparing a screenshot of Nostralius right before it shut down and people were saying goodbye in Ironforge to a Classic stress test on the last full day of the test where no one who is playing really cares about anything but leveling so they won't really be in cities at all. Also 10-20 people in Northshire abby is pretty high (but not high enough to be unplayable) and honestly I wish my experience were that way. 20-30 people in Goldshire is also pretty dang high. Despite what that crazy hyperobolic lunatic thinks, layering is not that big of a deal. Even if they mess up layering, who cares? It will only be in for a couple of weeks. I would say the best case is we end up in lots of layers with less people rather then in layers where you are constantly fighting for tags. What do you think will make people quit first: Seeing a reasonable amount of players around most of the time and not many some of the time or seeing so many people all the time that it hurts there experience?
---
See you on Shazzrah!
---
Im definitely holding off on LH until blizzard decides to add more realms and remove layering etc. But how can someone hope that the people that created LFR and sharding will ever understand the importance of the community sense in an MMO?

---
As someone who was there during vanilla.. they most certainly did NOT run ok. It was a total shit show for quite a while.
---
That's a bit concerning for me. When Wow launched I ended up on an unofficial Spanish server. They did not play nice, insisted on talking Spanish in global etc. Our guild and a few others re-rolled on a different server within a month.
---
wanna bet?
---
Sorry to necro. Is there a vid for this?
---
Heh? I said either there is surplus resources or surplus vendor gold (or a combination of the two).
---
If you think it’s unrealistic then please describe the realistic economy?
---
The hype is real, definitely pumped myself. The fears are mostly justified 2 tho and are only so passionate because of the hype.
---
We were having a ton of trouble getting enough people on the right layer.
---
To be honest, I'm scared/concerned. Tonight I was watching streamers and there was a massive PVP battle in razor hill. I ran down to get screen shots only to find it was happening on a different layer. So I missed it entirely. My later was dead. I don't want to have to invite my friends in order to see him when we are playing on the same server. 
---
Layering really just feels like a sneaky way of doing cross server without it really being called another server.
---
They didn't do layering in the history of wow either. Merging servers is a far better idea than this shit.
---
For awhile I was considering going Rogue in classic, so I was looking for some good examples.
---
I think the best streaming Rogue I found was Gozu.  He didn't place crazy high on the bracket, but watching him in Wpvp he'd do 1v1s and 2v1s and handle it well enough, and in BGs he was usually near the top on damage.
---
I don't pretend to know Rogue or know who's good or bad on it, but when I watch how Payo played vs Gozu, there was a discernible difference.
---
Specifying US politics implies that OP isn't from the USA. Most other countries aren't nearly so blatant while also somehow still being taken seriously as anything besides oligarchies or dictatorships.
---
agreed kek521, LAYERING NEEDS TO GO.
---
so people want higher local population during the first hype but accept a dead server after most people quit... yeah nice.
---
I also feel like still nobody knows how layering is supposed to work. You want more servers? Well each layer is like a server and they can be merged more easily when people start leaving.
---
The only issue is the abuse changing of layers which can be reduced to a minimum.
---
how?   
---
i literally cannot play without smoking because I keep thinking what a waste of time it is. When im stoned I am already  rendered partially helpless so I can only waste that time more fun by engaging in a game.   
---
To sit there sober and play wow would be the worst thing for me lol... acting like there is something to achieve in there beyond me lol. Just chill back mate and enjoy it, this seems like next level try hard-ism. I mean congrats if thats what you wished glad you have a strong enough reason to do so but man that would be boring as fuck if you ask me.

Apparently the profit algorithm metrics just aren’t there yet
---
Is this the same thing as elvui
---
Says the one who says the n word casually
---
he sounds a complete tool?
---
Yep. Anyone who kisses streamer's asses is a child.
---
Hehe dickbutt
---
Since most streamers are alliance it'd be disastrous if they played on Pagle since it potentially will be an alliance dominated realm already due to the alliance affiliation
---
I think that even if the attack and the shapeshift resolve "at the same time" the attack will use the statistics of your humanoid form since you weren't shifted before you used it.
---
Feel free to test though, the stress test is still up for several hours.
---
Why does it motivate you to practice healthy habits?
---
Hunter as one the least played class. People are such a liars, man.
---
and Spanish -- expect a lot of Spanish in chat. While Scandinavians are good at English, Spanish people are not. I've re-rolled from the unofficial Spanish server at wow launch for that exact reason.
---
Exactly, the only other "easy" change points to balance out layer population are flying, zeppelins, boats, coming our of instances. Im sure there are same kind of cutpoints in certain map limits, like going desolace to feralas (due to high level difference).
---
"Wow we are so inspired by how much love you have all showed for World of Warcraft Classic. You thought you wanted it AND YOU DID! Classic has been a bigger success than we could have possibly anticipated. So because of this phasing will be removed in phase 3." - Blizzard probably
---
Why does this matter?
---
Shading or layering, this is insane...
---
Correct? Hosting 100k people on layered servers and hosting 100k people on individual servers are the same thing infrastructure-wise.
---
The only reason they are doing it is to prevent dead servers and further lose of players?
---
I’ve been watching the code being updated on git and highly amused by the commit/code comments.
---
I’m really curious about RP PVP, but haven’t even done it. Can someone give me a little more info what what to expect on them in classic ?
---
You just pointed the reason why I am rolling in a RP-PVP realm. I am willing to take those risks and even change the plans of whatever event I am involved if the enemy is around and willing to attack. You completely got (in my opinion) the point why these servers exist.
---
I am willing to step on danger zones, because that's how the world is and it will intensify my RP experience.
---
This is cool and all, but the numbers are so heavily skewed by a bias sample that this data seems more or less worthless imo.
---
That's not how it works. A WoW server is made up of many pieces of hardware. They're not saving anything hardware wise by going for layering vs different servers. They're trying to prevent ghost realms. They're throwing the same amount of hardware at it, roughly.
---
No. Elvui isn’t updated as yet.
---
80%? Did you pulled this number out of your ass?
---
Yeah, starting zones were quite populated.
---
im not wasting 15 days sub to reserve a name, nice try blizz
---
&gt; Classic feels so great because they didn’t make every class the same. Everyone doesn’t have a stun everyone doesn’t have a heal, etc each class is unique
---
I definitely think there is some balance that could be done to the classic classes; they're not perfect.  But certainly nothing should ever go as far as the homogenization that is retail.
---
"It's only Alpha!"
---
"It's only Beta!"
---
"It's only a Stress test!!"
---
Don't you see what's going on here? Have you forgotten the mess that BfA is, or what blizzard has done over the past decade to WoW? 
---
2 weeks before launch and the systems are NOT working properly and you try to defend them... GTFO please
---
watching from eu like
---
Savage, but comes from a place of respect for what used to be.
---
Much obliged
---
Good shit man
---
Yeah. Just in case.
---
Great breakdown. Are you able to explain where this data came from? Was it the survey?
---
In other threads...
---
Oh the horrors or LAYERING. Its 2 players in each zone. Unplayable.
---
lol, i dont look to see who is a mod of a very public subreddit, their names are meaningless to me, but sure cool,
---
Disgusting. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.
---
Those fucking Peruvians man.
---
Reserving judgement till I see how it goes in game.
---
Makes sense, thanks :)
---
My layer was empty, please Blizz...
---
I think you would be both disheartened and surprised to know the reality of the situation.
---
I'm assuming Myzrael is a server. Guilds are formed by buying a petition which requires 8 signatures and then a guild is born. Finding them is easy. If you see someone in a guild (the guild name is under their name) you can ask them to join and an officer can invite you. A lot of times you'll see people recruiting for their guild with macros and a lot of times you'll just get a random guild invitation.
---
No item level showing, no achievements in game to require for invite, basically just a way for people to find each other without having to spam chat, seems fine to me.
---
On my mage I gave a priest a stack of water and buffed him and he was nice enough to give me a blue satchel. He was so thankful it made me smile and genuinely happy to have helped him even without getting the bag.
---
Lol yes! good times, Horde crushed us in The Barrens outside of Crossroads when we turned this raid into a counter xD so we'll call it even.
---
Well, you are the one who believes in non-existent things. So...
---
No, it's based on the numbers from blizzard and on the pservers for people that didn't get to 60, which is like 70% or something.   Then take into consideration that the game is "Free" for people playing retail.   Many of them will come along and make an account eventually, but most of them will be inactive.
---
I agree with what you're saying, but making an issue an "outrage" seems to be the only way to get Blizzard to take notice sometimes, and I think we can all agree that extensive layering would ruin what we're all hoping for for Classic more than any other issue.
---
Why the fuck is half the frontpage stupid southpark memes at any given time then
---
Do you have the % for all the different race/class/gender combinations? I wasn’t able to find it in the raw data. 
---
If you do, would you kindly post it for us to see?
---
Yeah it was, it came with the collector's edition of original WoW.
---
&gt;2nd monitor 
---
No changes!
---
sounds to me like activision/blizzard is  trying to cheap out on classic wow rather than anything else.
---
there is no hardware reason to have layering in classic wow at all.
---
If it was before legion or BFA (can't remember) then that's because it was a server located on the east coast of NA. Oceanic servers only got moved to Australia recently.
---
I would prefer to stay in the international side of WoW, if I move back to Europe, or to find other English speaking player outside the guild etc. If I understand correctly, if I sub for the Chinese version of the game I do not have a sub for the international one, right? Also I guess WoW is partially censored in China and some content is missing. So for me any international server really work. Maybe Taiwan is an option?
---
It was in original WoW though.  Collector's edition pet.
---
iirc higher level chests have a level requirement to open but I can't find anything to corroborate that assertion.
---
Don't show this clip to the anti-layering folks - they'll tell you it can't possibly be real because you'll never meet ANYONE on any layers ever  /s
---
happy to see some old school WoW fun coming back
---
Yeah, they def need more mods. Saw a lot of racism and xenophobia there yesterday.
---
the solution to this is very easy and has been posted here numerous times, your fears are unjustified.
---
This is unfortunately my experience as well.
---
If you had a fun to your head and had to make a guess, do you think there is a higher likelihood it will flip and remain 100-200 000 players, or become really big, like 1,2,3 mil.
---
I don't have to have played the game in vanilla to know that Ironforge had more than 1 person in it at a time.
---
Kinda looks like Diablo. Be cool if blizzard did a diabloesc game with world of warcraft classes :).
---
My RX 580 was about 75C or so at Quality 10 at 1080p and was taking it well. That was also at like 100 FPS.
---
If you turn V Sync on, or frame cap at your monitor's refresh rate it shouldn't ramp up as often. When I limited to 60 FPS my GPU usage dropped to about 75% and I was at about 50-55C. CPU doesn't need to work as hard either. Even if it's within spec, no reason to burn the hardware if the monitor can't display faster than 60 Hz.
---
People are so sensitive here.

Your safest bet will be to roll on a pure rp server if you don’t want your rp to be disrupted. If you however choose to roll on rp-pvp, phase 1 will be pretty calm for you.
---
Phase 2 is when the real gankfest starts as you’ll be able to earn honor by ganking and BGs won’t come till phase 3.
---
Your logic has no place before my feelings
---
It's a big enough sample to reasonably conclude that there'll be more horde players on pvp servers and more alliance on pve. But then you could probably guess that without the survey.
---
&gt;Layering blows but 1-5 hour ques don't work for regular consumer
---
People who asked for vanilla wanted vanilla servers. We never asked for layering, as it destroyed the entire meaning of said servers. It's toxic and it will kill classic. We have been waiting for over 10 years, we can wait 10 more hours sitting in a goddamn queue. Classic is delayed gratification, not instant gratification. I don't care about issues on launch, I care about the longevity of the game. With this shit in the game, I cannot find my friends nor can I give in-game directions (i.e.: let's meet up at crossroads for trade) because of layering.
---
It will kill classic and blizzard doesn't know WTF they are doing at this point.
---
Generally Scandinavians (more like the Nordic countries i guess) speak english with each other (even if it is your fellow countrymen) as it is culturally frowned upon to stand out and call attention to yourself. We usually like to play with the British and Dutch to show off our mediocre grasp of the english language.
---
In MMOs Europe is mostly split between the countries north of Germany (Dutchland can come too) and anything south thereof as smaller countries usually do not get their own servers/echo chambers and are forced to mingle. We have gotten used to this over the years...

When I hit lvl 10 I got a wand. I did the tailoring enchanting thing and it worked out quit well. Before I thought „whats the deal with wands cmon you give them too much credibility“. When I started using it I was mindblown how powerful I felt. That game has some kind of strange magic to it. Even after all those years
---
Layer the first zone so people can start quests without waiting a month to tag something. 
---
After that, the map breaks open more for quests and random monster farming. 
---
Having server pride is better if there's a server of people around you.
---
thats where the core of that problem lies. without that stupid shared subscription the tourist issue wouldn't be half as bad.
---
Shut up stinky idiot.
---
From what I've experienced, yes. Either you associate yourself with Russia and being Russian, or you hate their guts and try damn hard to do the exact opposite :)
---
Make sure the folder structure is such that the AdiBags.toc file lives at /_classic_/Interface/AddOns/AdiBags/AdiBags.toc - the zip downloaded from GitHub has an extra folder layer in there. Also make sure the AdiBags_Config folder is moved out into the AddOns folder too

Brian Birmingham (Lead Software Engineer, Blizzard): 
---
"The only thing I really want to call out on layering is **a lot of people were wondering if the population thresholds in the beta were accurate,  and they're not**. There were some people who said, 'Did they just turn this on to test it functionally to make sure it worked?' That's accurate. **We set the thresholds much lower on the beta than we would for live because we wanted to make sure we were actually testing the feature**."
---
The big WoW Classic interview by Eurogamer.
---
He says they lowered the layering thresholds during beta to make sure the technology works etc, he says beta though so I'm not sure if they did the same during the stress test but I hope that this is why layering is occurring much more than it should.
---
There will be just as many that oppose this behavior and will meet it with swift and deadly force. If he rolls pvp server, he will not be able to even move hell be camped so hard.
---
Blizzards inability to communicate is whats pisses me off the most tbh. I'm really looking forward to classic yet I don't know in what direction Blizzard wants to push it. What's their vision here?
---
For some reason this is always how it turns out :D
---
This is not all over a single issue w/ Ironforge.  This has been an issue for months, throughout beta.

Up to you man. Latency is a big deal, especially when it's above 180 - it enters a whole other region of netcode that causes some very unpleasant situations. If it's below that, or you really just don't care, then all the power to you. Just keep in mind that it's not all roses and sunshine in NA either, there are tons of problems, too. It's not some coveted haven for the gifted and patient.
---
That totally looks like Ryan Gosling
---
They do understand, they just don't care. The whole organization is also infiltrated and corrupted by demons.
---
Streamers get their fair share in dollars from actual streaming though, it has pros and cons and one con being famous enough to have their name taken if they're too slow.
---
If Blizzard were to hire them directly then they could get privileges as Blizzard employees (like name reservation, same fashion as GM's do) otherwise they're just players like everyone else and shouldn't get any special treatment.
---
Hmph. Such a tough decision lol. I could always have multiple characters but I'm the kind of guy that likes to main one class for as long as possible. I've played a warlock too in the past and had an alright time. 
---
Priest seems like best of both worlds because they can DPS and heal pretty well, but I want my portals dammit. 
---
I guess worst case scenario I can make a priest, warlock, and mage during name reservations later and figure out exactly what I want to do later.
---
Has anyone seen the Norwegians?! I always run into Danes and Swedes, but Norwegians always seems to be hiding?
---
It's not the most downloaded. It's not even top 20.
---
As to the "point", I think it's probably fine. Using an addon to aid in group formation isn't the problem with retail. The problem is random crossrealm matchmaking that keeps players anonymous and makes them not give a shit about who they're playing with, because they will almost certainly never see these people again.
---
Yeah, I don't know why they kept saying that.
---
If memes make you sad, the sadness is within you
---
A single report does absolutely nothing. That's why streamers have the power to blacklist people from enjoying the game.  
---
Because a hundred reports will get you banned immediately.  
---
That's how the report system works- having a gm check out every single report for millions of players is virtually impossible.
---
That was the beta and not the stress test. Also what does it mean that it was more sensitive? Could mean a number of things. I want to know that what we see on the streastest is like at least 20 times as many layers at it will be when it goes live.
---
We're toxic because we told Blizzard for years on end, almost a decade by this point, that phasing isn't fun, and then they decide to give us a game with no phasing but then add a broken version of it anyway?
---
People are not being toxic - people are concerned and disappointed. Learn the difference, you toxic shitflinger. :)
---
Stupid Question, but it seems like I forgot how exactly it worked: As soon as I craft Truefaith West I can drop tailoring and still be able to wear it, right? And be able to take it off and back on again?
---
I hate streamers!... and I youtubers!
---
I wanted to play something else, but playing a carbon-copy of my retail toon (human mage) just feels right.
---
You can send mail to characters that have been created but not logged in for the first time, however casters are going to want their lesser magic wands after 2-3 hours of playing.
---
just transfer server?
---
So not being in a panic is considered ass kissing now?
---
Fuck im blad most big streamers are NA, so that I can avoid them ;)
---
Yeah seeing pserver culture was pretty revolting on the whole sadly.
---
I'm not sure about it. They are still testing that for some reason? Wouldn't they try to test how it's supposed to be. What does low threshold even mean?
---
And it didn't work properly.
---
I was doing lost but not forgotten and can confirm it zone swaps in the riven still with nodes fading in and out
---
NO TAKE BACKSIES!
---
Someone needs to tell them to stay with their choice.
---
Never watched an asmongold stream. Are people just perpetually hanging around him wherever he goes? What made this dude so famous?
---
Because 10 servers with 1 namespace means you will from the beginning start with solid world with a static community. With 10 layers you would have no integral world. The other 9 servers will not affect you in any way except that their character names would be reserved from your server also, and when the server merges finally happen (only once!) then some of the servers would be merged and as a result new character names would become available (the servers that used your namespace but did not merge to your server due to their sizes).
---
Says who?
---
There's a quote from a week ago saying they did that for the previous beta and stress test, but not this one.
---
We're two weeks to launch and they have no further load tests scheduled.  The layering settings in this stress test are going to be the ones they expected to go-live with.
---
Hopefully they can refine their plan with the feedback we are giving them this weekend.
---
Horde tank present o7 :)
---
It’s Activision Blizzard now.  You can bet when this fat cow takes off; they will find ways to milk it.  How long before we get paid transfers, paid name change, etc? I bet it will be quick.
---
Yeah, my point was more that being young there's a good chance you'd grow out of it.
---
I hope one day the servers could be stable enough to hold a mass fight between the armies of the streamers vs the armies of NA players. Meet in the Barrens with hundreds of players and fight it out LOTR style
---
Have you actually played the stress test?
---
The first few hours were an absolute clusterfuck with people camping every single spawn point of mobs to try and maybe get a tag while hammering their 1 keys. Even the morning after was very busy in the starting zones.
---
Of course it went down somewhat after that, not many kept playing after they did their initial test (and a lot didn't even know, the servers where still up). Why would most people keep playing when everything gets wiped anyways, and even if they were still online to test something, why would they stand around in a major city. Those are hubs for high level players.
---
The linked article is just cherry picking to paint a twisted picture.
---
Simple because it took no effort or actual thought why server mergers are fucking awful and not vanilla like either
---
Yeah it was Swamp of Sorrows. Good times.
---
Or get a spam add on and add the word amsond
---
That's even worse, you now split the name groups so wide you will end up with all sorts of nonsense, and huge numbers of names will never get used due to tourist.
---
It was already a problem in the stress test. It will be a problem on classic.
---
Layering is the issue, not what they are testing.
---
Half the fucking *point* of Vanilla was that you had One Shared World. If Blizzard won't provide that, why bother?
---
Dude come on this post is so low effort it's practically a trump supporter...
---
&gt;It's a big enough sample to reasonably conclude that there'll be more horde players on pvp servers and more alliance on pve.
---
You can guess that will be the case but you can't use statistics to get there "reasonably". Its been a while since stats but you can't take a minority of a minority then use it to predict the total result.

---
No if I wanted an empty world I'd be telling them to release 100 servers to start and merge them later...
---
Really, rp pvp is just a pvp server with an rp sort of focus. The only Blizz enforced rule is naming conventions.
---
Unofficially, if you troll RP/gank at will on what might be an RP event. Prepare to die. Even though RPers tend to be less skilled or geared in most games, in classic 10 pissed off noobs can still kill just about anything. Do it too often, and they are the kind of people to pay gold to the better players to camp you until you uninstall.
---
Short version, dont bother with rppvp if you arent an RPer or respectful of it
---
Good thing he was thinking of not going pvp
---
There's still 2-3 million people playing retail.  You needed a sub to play on the stress test.
---
Yeah it wont be enough with only 2 pvp servers
---
If Asmon and other streamers can get even 6 hours of playtime before their server is made common knowledge Asmon for instance will already be nearly finished with Elwyn and ready to head for Westfall. The horde of spergs will then have 2 options, compete with the other 100 spergs trying to catch up to Asmongold doing their best to level to him or run to him at level 1 and not be able to compete with his level 10 character's mobs as he gets further and further ahead of the spergs.
---
If Asmon can get out of the starting zone and to level 10 before everybody knows what server he is on he's in for a relatively smooth leveling experience.
---
Bro, he just can't respect you anymore.... just lol
---
Think the plan is to only keep it during the initial hype with a maximum of up to phase 1. With any luck it will be gone asap.
---
*slaps roof of hunter* this bad boy can fit so many fucking buffs in it
---
You still need physical servers to run virtual ones and there is no way in hell they're running just one physical server, they're going to have a couple for redundancies sake.
---
People outside this community dont know that classic is getting released. Therefore I dont think it will blow up. It will be bigger than blizzard expects and bigger than retail in my opinion. I humbly expect the numbers to drop very slightly just due to overall hype in this community. Some people will decide its not for them. But it will be lesser amount of players than what blizzard expects, since vanilla is really catchy. This will maybe opens eyes for blizzard to make some advertising and make it big. Just time will tell, we can only guess till then
---
You need a mage to go deep frost for winter's chill and it's expected that his dps will be lower based on not being able to take ap. Might as well raid as winter's chill in a PvP spec
---
And a pvpguild will quite easily wipe streamers and their fanboy following. Stock up on sapper charges!
---
Yes, it is like any other BOE gear once you craft it. No further ties to tailoring.
---
Nope. You just need cordination and people with sapper charges

PVP starts at 20:00 ish.

Priest can heal really well, and not dps that well (in raids).

it stops being the actual game because of who he would be playing with?
---
As soon as the big streamers decide which server they choose, i'll know.  
---
From what I've read, they'll be going to Herod, so that will leave Whitemane or Thalnos (the only servers with the cool names left). I tested ping and I got 35ms and 60ms on those servers, so it doesn't seem like it really matter which one as long as big streamers aren't on it.

Go where the ping is good, and there are no streamers.

yeah cause hes clearly not making fun of everyone who worries what him and the other streamers are going to do and crying for weeks about.
---
Yeah, at my local game shop they told everyone to chose Stormscale as server at the launch event.

Capital cities are going to be quite empty UNTIL people start hitting L60. Then you will see loads of people there. Most of the masses are out in the world, levelupping. Not holding their dick in orgrimmar.

Should I use my druids original name or the character name of my friend that died to an OD (first friend I ever made in WoW)?
---
Will the stress test folders be deleted tomorrow when the realm name reservations come online? In other words, do we need to save the folder inside the character before 9am pst ?
---
Way to go with the broad generalization here, buddy. This is just more German self-loathing, self-flagellation and inferiority complex.
---
I can't say I've ever made particularly worse experience with German game communities compared to international ones and I've played EVE Online for close to a decade and that's about as international as it get.
---
Also, from my time playing Vanilla WoW on PServers, I'd say most the truly stupid and toxic shit in world chat came distinctly not from German players.
---
They have their own discord where they decide things
---
yeah remember when in 2004 we all played with layering and all these new addons ported from 15 years in the future and all these new interface and graphics options and the legion client and nu-blizzard and all these weird bugs and inconsistencies that shouldn't be there but are because the game is a hobbled, hacked together piece of shit basically re-created by 1 man in blizzard's basement?

classic is essentially a new game buddy.

"With server merges, you all of a sudden have a bunch of players that you never even had the opportunity to play, group or guild with on your server."
---
This is the same thing with layering, you think you will get to play and know everyone on a server with 100K people on ?
---
For anyone interested: Let's say the relation of the Realm Distribution will actually be this way. Considered \~1million players for Classic this would mean the german PvE Realm only gets 9k players, while  Shazzrah gets 174k players.
---
I really hope most germans simply didn't vote, otherwise this whole "pls make german servers" (which I was against btw) was server suicide.
---
It was available all weekend? Wish I knew that, I only did to lvl 10 because of work but would have played all weekend if I knew
---
A city where you see no-one feels dead. Doesn't matter if there *may* be a second player on the other end. You don't need \/who to *see* players.
---
Pretty sure this is against Blizzard's ToS.
---
Oh yes. Racism, pale cartoon girls, gifs of male strippers, and pepe spam. 
---
At least most of it is confined to a few channels where they can let it all out.
---
I don't think Esfand or Summits community would be that bad honestly. Esfand is just a chill guy with a good community and Summit regularly plays open world multiplayer games and doesn't get hardcore griefed considering he is sitting on 20-30k viewers.
---
If they can get a full 40 man raid that's prepared for world PvP and can get the drop, they can probably crush 1,000 unprepared spergs.
---
There could be literally zero function to the town and plenty of people would be sitting around there.
---
I agree. I am sure Bobby B agrees too.
---
Most of the people I played with were Swedish Danish or Norwegian. They are great peeps
---
SOON ENOUGH, THAT CHILD WILL SPREAD HER LEGS AND START BREEDING!
---
Two weeks before release, they are not fixing shit anymore, just making sure whatever they have now WORKS. So dont expect anything to happen.
---
We will see what happens on release. I just hope Blizzard knows what theyre doing...
---
And poor Esfand tonight was trying to distance himself from those types of streamers, who have large crowds of spergs. He doesn't want all streamers with 1000+ viewers seen in the same way as Asmon, and thus be targeted. Esfand is a good guy, I don't think anyone will repeatedly camp him, or Venruki, Ziqo, or MadSeason. It's really just a couple of streamers.
---
Damn, just a couple weeks left....
---
At what time can we reserve the names? (Europe)

&gt; Cores are not threads.
---
Except when Intel doesn't put hyperthreading on all their processors it does (the 9th gen i7 9700 doesn't have threading). Also I never made this claim and the claim I did make still holds true even looking at 8c/16t processors.  
---
&gt; And wow is multi core enabled and will use all avaliable cores

That isn't how threading works.

A person like me. I netted 47G Got Mining and Eng to 150.  Had 110+ in both proff at /played 15H.   
---
It was a great practice run for playing the AH. I am one of those who will be playing AH full time. :-) Probably server as a bank for highend raiding guilds! :-)
---
There were probably players in other layers who wished to take part but couldn't
---
Awwww thanks man!! ❤️
---
ACKCHYUALLY FINNS are Fenno-Scandinavian and Nordic but not SCANDINAVIAN
---
Thats how the uproar usually goes, glad to be the one this time
---
Dont compare TBC with Vanilla though ... at best you will be wearing a dress buffing groups of people in Raids.
---
According to realmpop.com, the language split in etail WoW split is:
---
*12% French
---
*14% Russian
---
*25% German
---
*49% English + everyone else
---
The German language community is roughly half the size of the "English + everyone else" group. There is one German PvE and one PvP vs. two English ones each. Which means that the German servers will most likely be every bit as crowded as the the English ones. 
---
If there there is going to be a problem with dead servers, it will most likely affect the French and Russian servers, as they have the same number of servers as the Germans but only half the playerbase.
---
None of them look like Ryan Gosling.
---
Roll Whitemane and gg for the horde
---
Between the norwegian and the nordicclassic project we have 4-5k confirmed players. Then we hopefully get both the danish and the finnish guilds joining in aswell(most of them havent contacted us). Then theres all the unconfirmed and guildless people. So yeah what the end number of players gonna be is hard to say but one thing is for sure its going to be crazy.
---
Make your main with your old name and your bank alt the friend's name. This way you are sending mail to your friend every day and his name lives on the SW/Org AH wall forever.
---
Maybe he should stream it. The cycle continues.
---
East coast is where majority of the streamers are going.
---
WTF BLIZZARD? NO CHANGES!
---
I said you'll at least have the chance to play with them. People will be able to recruit people for their guild a lot easier from a bigger pool as more people will be looking for the same thing as they are instead of forming a guild and bonds with people that have to make sacrifices to be in the guild, just to find another, more convenient guild in phase 2.
---
It LITERALLY wasn't possible for a bunch of people to join this fight since they were stuck on a different layer.
---
I sure hope -- I rolled Spinebreaker at launch -- had to reroll to escape the spanish community
---
Me and my friends played on launch with 15k people online and had a blast.
---
My bets are on blizzard, within the next two week, not being able to fix the issues they’ve consistently failed to resolve over the past two and a half months. We’ll see.
---
Fuck this is really annoying, I thought it was 6am here but turns out it is 10am which means I am at work 😭

Engineers make ammo.

BE ftw
---
Normal Speed nowadays. Beating &lt;4 Days is the Challenge now. Without rested XP.
---
how is choosing the same server as opponents you want to face against the TOS?
---
I already love how there is zero english world in that post
---
You know which areas were packed full of people? The starting zones, where players actually are when they log into the game and play.
---
Why are major cities big hubs where people hang out? Because of the ah close by to profession trainers/vendors and banks and because people are waiting for groups or because they have nothing to do in the world at the moment.
---
None of those reasons apply to a stress test with such a low level cap where everything will get wiped a few days after (or according to the first information, 24 hours after start, many people didn't even know it got extended).
---
Welcome to the pain train.
---
You don't really have to buy a new account.. you just have to resub. The most you lose is your character and whatever sub time you had remaining. It could really hurt if you subbed for 6 months I guess but if you pay for your sub monthly it isn't that bad.
---
Layering would fuck that up
---
I assume servers will open in the login screen and you will choose and create/delete freely on all servers until you will be allowed to enter world on the 27th.
---
i would sy 3-8 weeks works as a few weeks.
---
Consider a year is 52 weeks long i would definitely call 8week "a few weeks"
---
That said, i hope layering is gone after the first wek.
---
Yeah and the literal translation sounds weird in my opinion but ofc its question of taste. Anyway: have fun on german server maybe we will randomly meet up again in a dungeon :)
---
Jane Snow Frost Mage
---
&gt; Im trying to get myself to roll gnome for the racial but I dont think I have it in me.
---
I tried on ps server, no way i'm playing a gnome ever.
---
What if the streamer and all his followers report the players ganking them? Wouldn't it ban the gankers instantly for a few hours?
---
My feeling says, multiply this data x10 and the numbers are accurate...  
---
Also servers on fire
---
Server names is defo opinion, I think the NA server names are far better.
---
While I agree layering can be an issue this is comparing things that can't be compared. Taking a screenshot in the middle of Ironforge on a stress test where level 15 is the cap after 3 days and comparing it to a private server which was here to stay with level 60 people is pretty silly.
---
They also said they have exaggerates the later threshold to make sure it works as intended.
---
I'll start complaining only once the game gets released and if there is an issue with layering. Until then, everything is impossible to justify.
---
X-roads was the place to be.  Had tons of level 15's just hanging out, dueling, and I presume trying to get groups for WC.  Why would anyone be in a capital city instead of X-roads unless they are doing RFC or training weapon skills/professions?
---
Layering needs to be turned off in central hubs (IF, ORG, SW etc), as well as world raid boss areas.
---
How silly would it be a guild misses a world boss, so they just layer-hop until they get to one with the world boss up....
---
Ah yes, you're certainly someone with nuanced opinions. A view of your profile makes that evident. As if mongoloids like you who generalize anyone defending layering as someone who is ruining the game, I think your mental gymnastics far outweigh any of the bullshit I throw back right at people.
---
Bit dramatic for a thread about layering, whay so you mean Bobby B?
---
EASY, BOY! YOU MIGHT BE MY BROTHER BUT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE KING!
---
This is messed up. Fix please.
---
You will be able to log in to the character screen of the final realms from aug 13th (for character creation/name reservation), but you won't be able to log into the world until release.
---
You know what happens every single time they've said "Oh, it's just a test/beta, it will get better"?
---
It didn't.
---
no, they likely won't say until after they try to reserve their name.
---
Ganking isn't a ToS violation
---
&gt; It LITERALLY wasn't possible for a bunch of people to join this fight since they were stuck on a different layer.
---
Join raid, get into that layer. Leave raid, invite new people to your layer.
---
And nobody knows what was the stress tests layer limits.
---
Yeah I got my Collections edition as well. But that 1 bag slot is to heavy of a price to pay!
---
I've noticed a lot of bugs that were previously fixed in beta/previous stress tests cropping up. It's possible they rolled out an older version of the client in order to have it playable with a wider audience (more servers, etc). Here's hoping a lot of this is fixed come launch in just under two weeks.
---
Insignificant mortals
---
&gt; Layers don't increase server capacity, just spread people out who already logged in
---
It is.
---
Dwarf rogues don’t look as good as Humans. Also, sword spec bonus.
---
Reee..you have never played classic..lol
---
To be fair, people like this are probably the reason the streamers dont want to say where they're going until the day on launch, which will in turn annoy the rest of the playerbase.

sadly, it would not. there's a discord with info on this type of tanking.

P.S. Found it! https://discord.gg/4QWqKFV
---
Its continent wide, the tech doesn't allow for layers to end a zone borders. So if you have 5 layers in Northshire Abbey/Elwyn Forest, those exist for all of the eastern kingdoms.

It could just be that they're not min-maxing rather than them lying. Vanilla wow PvE just isn't difficult enough to justify not playing your preferred race for a lot of people.

Which means it has the potential to get fixed?

It's not so much on the streamer as it is on the streamsniper wanting attention.
---
One of my fondest memories on a server that shall not be named, was ganking Docken from blackout in Ungoro till he whined on stream. More power to you guys!
---
I support this.
---
Yeah that could also work
---
For the weapon yeah you only have to get it once normally but if you want to keep the title above your head you have to grind it everyday since it's a weekly reset. 
---
That's in the case blizzard doesn't change this system
---
No, why?
---
Realistically at worse you need to relog every now and then due to the phasing bug, and don't see quite so many people. It's not good but it's also not game breaking.
---
How do i go about reserving the names ? Do i need to download wow classic??
---
Also I do not like the new motive they had to justify the situation: an invasion. I prefer the original: pure air was free and should not be paid like had been.
---
Because u cant fill them before they open?:D
---
I feel old, I started with Quake 2
---
I don't think the problem is about the starting area but with the low number of serv. With only 11 serv for the US, and 6 internationnal serv for EU, they basically can not host  a lot more than 17\*10k people (Huge overestimate of what serv are capable of wihtout layering, but hardwaare this day are far better than back in the days so who knows) so they are estimating that world wide only 170k people are still gonna play at the end of P1?
---
Nice, going for personal attacks and insults. Hang in there bud!
---
how old is this song dude?
---
That is actually amazing. Ima try getting back the last 2 years! 
---
Or some of it at least :D
---
You think everyone is pissed only about the cities being full?
---
What happens if my guild hears about a enemy faction raid going on in a zone, we decide to group up and move there only to realize that they are on another layer? That's not very fun having to deal with is it? Maybe for people who wanna PVE only this is not an issue, but if you are into world PvP this is a massive issue.
---
Man, I love being on EU so I don't have to waste my time caring about any of this.
---
&gt; To be fair I have used it a lot over the years
---
Most people who just install it and haven't worked with it will find it extremely technical. Especially if you don't want the default look.
---
Good luck questing in any zone a major streamer is in.
---
Know thy enemy
---
yeah i also recognized this. also, my x1440p resolution seems to give the game trouble.

Yeah I suppose I know what you mean. Omen of clarity is so nice though

"I'll help!"

We barely take it down, good loot drops for out level. Might as well have been an open world raid boss.
---
Aka them using rule seven on something that is absolutely a valid criticism and should remain on the forum is abusing that generic rule to remove anything they want.
---
petty
---
More like anti-'streamer-community'

You guys are so dramatic
---
You’re stupid

Hell even 5 mages are enough. On my server there was a group of 4 mage that were dead on zg island, they were waiting for alliance raid to pop the zg buff to res and 4xblastwave + sapper. (They had a rogue hidden to tell them when to) Every time it was a full wipe. Even if multiple raid were there.
---
What if I am aiming for that name for reasons of my own that have nothing to do with him?  I should have just as much right as him to reserve the name.
---
That's a relief
---
source?
---
It was interesting until Tips voice and face appeared.
---
I posted this in another thread, but it applies here as well.   So, this is what is happening.
---
&gt;He got put in another layer.  The  people  in town are ideal candidates to move to another layer, because   there's no chance they're fighting shit.  The game dynamically moves   people to different layers when it creates or removes a layer.  This is   working as intended.  
---
&gt;Let's say  the cap for a layer is 100  people.   This isn't how it works really,  but for this example it's good  enough.   The 101st person logs in.   What happens?   You probably think  that 101st person goes into layer 2  all by himself, right?   Kind of  makes sense, but that's not what  happens.   What actually happens is the  server pulls people from layer  1, and throws then into layer 2 with the  101st person, so he isn't all  alone.   People in town are ideal for  throwing into a different layer,  because they're not fighting something.  
---
&gt;I   am sure you've seen the "I got layered videos", right?  Well, the same   thing is happening there more or less.   The server is trying to stay   balanced, and the wrong people are getting caught in the crossfire.   But  this is a bug, and shouldn't be happening.
---
100% agree. And it will be easier to just reroll on a lower pop server in the start. If you are in a hugely overpopulated server, but you have your guild and characters at 60 you cant reroll anymore. Sucks to find out that you should have done it at the start of phase 2 instead of just two days of played.. have a pop que, then the people that dont have any connection to pre-decided server can roll somewhere else instead of waiting 1h+ in que.
---
Secretive bunch arent they...

Never knew how chat channels worked in this regard. Thanks for the TIL and the heads up!

:O We were definitely in the same raid! What's your character name?

this is so clever. well done. its like the fatigue feature is designed for this purpose haha

No two summits, a random guy said Golemagg for his own interest or opinion, but the Spanish Coalition voted yesterday night.

Im still lost on people wanting to play an mmo solo.
---
Even better: Report them to Twitch also. Streamers have been banned for less.
---
So you took screenshots from a healthy private server at peak times/events and compared it to WoW Classic stress test that capped out at level 15 where people would likely not be in a major city and out actually questing?  When I logged in every starting zone was packed they were nothing like your screenshots here.
---
It's not only a function of the size of the population but also the distribution. A packed server is mainly a problem while leveling because of the shared open world.
---
A few weeks after release, a lot of players will be level 60. At level 60, you will spend a lot of time doing instanced content (raids, BGs, 5 mans), so a high population size will become less problematic. 
---
This, in addition to player attrition, will probably enable Blizaard to drop layers at some point.
---
He's sarcastically implying the anti-streamer argument is that he will intentionally take the server over.
---
The point he's missing is that whether or not he advocates or encourages toxic behavior, he has a very large fan base, and Asmon has no control over them. They will make the trade and general chats absolute cancer, not to mention flood any zone Asmon is in, making it unplayable.
---
Offering up this kind of sarcastic response about how it's not his fault, he isn't telling people what to do, etc... is either dense or a cop out.

PoE has problems with it because just like classic it requires a lot more communication.
---
what do you mean?
---
Looking at the server discord, this server already feels like an RP haven. Excited to see what release brings!
---
Ah yes thank you, this was one of my favorites from back in the day.
---
Pretty much yeah. Wipe layer 1 out, Get an invite to layer 2 wipe it out get an invite to layer 3 wipe it out repeat till level 60.
---
Thanks! 
---
Do you know if we choose the severs or we just reserve name on all servers?
---
Do you have a source for that?
---
It was, and it felt good. Later on though in durotar/ogrimmar/barrens the layering hit hard.
---
Yup. Like Frostmourne
---
&gt;but if everyone is displayed at the same time, there will be no mobs to kill for quests.
---
Perfect. This is exactly the experience that I want. This gives down time for in-world socialization and coordination to party up for named mobs, so that all the people who need it get credit. Last time I played a private server we were doing hoggers in waves, throwing up a message in zone chat, "killing hoggers in 5, who needs?" Etc. I don't want a sterile solo experience. I want ***a goddamn MMO***
---
&gt;The best they can do is display more people per layer.  
---
They can delete layers as a concept. It's not classic, it ruins classic.
---
I’m thinking about it for sure either this or the pacific rp pvp server
---
Yeah, Joe Rogan himself seems a lot more nuanced, he has some beliefs that seems quite conservative, but then at other times he expresses beliefs that's so left-leaning it's almosr socialist. Tbh I think he does a good job hiding his true political leaning, and he's quite neutral when talking to guests (just watch the recent Bernie Sanders episode).
---
Forsen said on stream that he wont be playing classic. That you have to go 100% into classic if youre gonna play it and he still wants to play new releases
---
but by then it will be too late
---
Saying shitty things and riling up his fan base and then hiding behind " its a joke bro, i was being sarcstic" doesn't make me want to join his server any more.

doesn't matter if its the same thing but worse, simply put

Layering bad

keeping it in until the end of phase 1 is absurd though

Well, the stress test queues for one. But the WoW subscriber base is massive still. Sure it's not work levels but if we take your 2000 players per sever that gives us a grand total of around 50,000 players across both the Europe and US. Does that sound realistic to you? Considering WoW currently has anything between 2 - 6 millions worldwide subs, you really only expect 1-2% of the current subscriber base will only even try WoW classic, and then adding the 10s if not 100s of thousands of people who will resubscribe just to play classic, again at least at the beginning. Even if we're really ridiculously conservative and say excluding China, WoW has 1 million subscribers at the time of classic launch, and only 20% of those even try classic WoW on release day You have a population of 200,000 across eu and us servers, or 8000 per server. These numbers I feel are ridiculously low as well. No one knows how many subs WoW has currently, even if we use the weakauras leak which was debunked as being too low we have at least around 2 million. So yeah, using at least double the subscriber number, adding in what I'm sure will be a significant chunk of returning players, the low amount of servers and I'm personally confident that a significant larger fraction than a fifth of the current player base will at least try classic in the beginning we have a whole lotta people on each server. I don't think private servers are an accurate representation at all for numbers on the official game, the number of players who play them is a drop in the ocean
---
Having an awesome wife that plays WoW with you must be absolute dopamine overload bliss.
---
Sometimes it’s more fun to have an interaction with people, dawg.
---
The funniest thing about Soda's bitching is no good guild will give a fuck about his "list". I've raided in top 20 guilds on retail, we had a group that just liked fucking with streamers. With all their bitching I wouldn't be surprised to see top guilds camp them together.
---
Stop being reasonable and logical. Can't you see it's upsetting people?
---
You will have to choose a Server before making a char. So be sure to choose one before the Reservation opens up to be save to get your desired Name ;)
---
&gt;I will be the first person with a pitchfork if what we're getting now is what we'll see on release.
---
If this is what you see at release it's to late.
---
I certainly wouldn't call Questie a must have addon. Plenty of people despise the modern RPG design, where the game shows you eactly what you must do and where you must go to finish a quest.
---
Speaking of Chinese players... are there Classic servers in Asia? Didn't see any blue posts about it.
---
They can ignore a ticket, they can’t ignore it if it’s all the forums are talking about
---
Nice PSA!
---
The 5% intellect is just a small increase that doesn't really matter.
---
Exept that if you tried to sell things in ogrimmar you noticed that it was layered.
---
Play what you like
---
It doesn't matter, realisticly.
---
Pick what you want.
---
What about the massive crowd that is intently planning on ganking streamers nonstop to get their 10 seconds of fame?
---
Yikers
---
Yeah... I've to be honest, I wanted to play a Horde race to not spoild myself from classic release.
---
And to not being attached to my character, I create a female tauren hunter called Uglylady...
---
Not proud of myself.. but to be honest it works !
---
I played on a PS where it had many guilds from many countries.
---
General chat was in english and times where i did end up in a group speaking another language I just told them i only speak English. It rarely happened and in all occasion they spoke to me in English.
---
But Overwatch is a game that is won/lost depending on your communication. The Koreans/Chinese know all the words they need.
---
“Tracer left! Monkey no Primal! Shield cooldown. Kill Reaper!” Etc
---
Raiding/Organised PvP/Dungeons become a lot harder, otherwise in the general open word, no not really. I imagine it'd be very isolating in what is otherwise a very communal game.
---
This will be worse than streamers joining a server, beggars outside each store in every city, that will be adding a HUGE population to the server. Expect long queuing times! ;)
---
Yikes. Failed to become a streamer so he must leech off them by ganking them, good luck buddy.
---
If it has an easily available solution it doesn't constitute griefing, they always have the option of rolling on a PvE server.
---
With all the infographics on this sub, are there anyone showing what a class bring to a group beside dps/healing/tanking, like sheep, decurse, portal etc. for mage.
---
I would love to see that, as the dps rotation isn't that helpful to pick a class.
---
I have heard the idea of completely new content too under the vanilla path which I think would be awesome! There was really something about getting 40 people on the same page and that's why so few were able to finish up all of AQ let alone even touch a boss in Naxx.
---
I think Blizz is in a position to do a lot of stuff differently this go around. Guess just like where the streamers settle in we will have to wait and see. But 100% new content in the vanilla world I think would be sick so it rally brings back that work hard and unknown factor.
---
For PvE the difference is utterly irrelevant. For PvP the difference is more substantial, but unless you're planning on playing on the cutting edge it's nothing to be worried about.

Servers A and B get merged. You have a character, let's call him Thex and an established guild, let's call it Thixx on server A.
---
A character of the same name in the same guild also exists on server B.
---
Both characters have similar levels of activity (/played), same level and have built reputation on their server.
---
Both guild have been maintaining their reputations for months/years.
---
How do you fairly decide who gets to keep their identity and who doesn't (and remember that identity and reputation are a huge part of Classic)? By checking creation dates? Comparing achievements? Checking who's been more active in an arbitrary time frame? Get people involved in a voice chat to talk it out? None of these are really fair and impartial. Whoever has to change will get the short end of the stick and grow bitter towards both Blizzard and they guy who didn't have to change. Which might eventually lead to them quitting the game.
---
You might think that a few people quitting is no big deal but it would create a dangerous precedent: Blizzard can and will take your shit away if they feel like it. This is one of the big reasons people chose not to play on pserver in the past and a PR nightmare of epic proportions for the developer. 
---
Which would have a cascading effect among already active players and might discourage new players from trying the game and joining.
---
This is true for both mergers and free transfers, the only difference being that with transfers you are semi-actively choosing this to happen and the currently inactive players don't return to a shitshow of changed names.
---
Layering is the least of all possible evils in the situation Blizzard is in.
---
You just stated your own presumption twice without actually looking into an opposing perspective.
---
This same excerpt is being quoted as a way to counter streamers in another thread that's gotten hundreds of upvotes and replies. 
---
It applies just as well here as it does there.
---
Its to stop people putting /spit in a macro 50 times and spamming it
---
This subreddit's obsession with streamers is sad and cringey.
---
You need to find a completely unguarded chest, not just unguarded not there can't be any mobs remotely close to it.
---
I think aggro range increase 1 yd for each level difference between you and the mob. In the plaguelands pre-10 you will have something like the standard 20 yd plus another 40 yd from level difference, so you would need a chest with no mobs around it.

Layering is here to stay. That’s why they announce only a few realms per type.

Yes you are right, Chinese [battle.net](https://battle.net) account is different from the rest of the world. If you create a Chinese account you will not be able to migrate it to NA/EU/OCE account.

But WoW is not censored in China lol, all the content is here. From what I heard the only options for SEA players are OCEANIC (Australia) or China, didn't heard about Taiwan realm

---
It's all up to you, I choose to play on chinese realm for a better latency (30ms) and timezone. Too hard to play with 300ms constantly and not the same timezone
---
i seriously see no issue with layering  when they clearly stated that **its only a temporary thing** , i can live **a month of layering** to the alternative of not being able to get a mob to kill during first few weeks ..... just my feelings.
---
its not about having difficulty communicating with eachother and moreso about a large group of people refusing to play with the rest. People of the same nationality/native language also tend to work cross faction with eachother etc
---
it's a bit blown out of proportion but I dont think the problems people foresee are that farfetched.
---
Most of them cant even speak english, just like the french. So even if they dont spam trade/world, you still wont be able to communicate with a part of your server.
---
I dont understand the french getting their own server(and i wont even roll on that being a french speaker) and the spanish not getting it. Approx the same size of community
---
Seeing this I'm wondering who said no sharding? How comes that it stuck in my mind and I kept reading there will be no sharding at all, only Layering? I'm confused.
---

---
Ja det er sku lidt af en language barrier når 4 mennesker ikke gider snakke engelsk og så kicker de dig fra grupper eller gider ikke lave portals eller vand til dig.
---
No way, man. You experience more of a sense of community with language barriers. (In real life, at least). 
---
If the person who is trying to communicate with you actually gives a shit about you, they will make an effort to be understood.

Layering has a higher chance do discourage me from playing WoW than my wife ever could.
---
Yes, it is a huge deal.  In legion my guild started of using pugs from Brazilian servers.  We didn't know quel Thalos was Brazilian.  We had no bias.  But ever single time we got a person from that server they were toxic.  Even if they had the gear requirements they still could not do basic mechanics and you couldn't communicate their mistakes most of the time because they didn't speak English.  They were notoriously toxic when they did speak English.  All in all my major complaint is that they were clueless about raid mechanics.  
---
To help you better understand.  If one person stands in the wrong spot while fighting a boss it can kill everyone.  If someone attacks the wrong target it can kill everyone.  If you can't make callouts during a fight someone can die.  Communication in a raid setting is everything.  You want short precise call outs.
---
No they won't. Why do you think that?
---
All you need to do is log into a 1.12.1 client to know that it doesn't exist like it does on "Classic". So you are correct, it shouldn't be there, but also, does it matter?
---
Because there is not, China or Australia only
---
And marmite. Dont forget marmite.
---
Yes. You basically log onto Classic WoW as you would of you're about to play then create a character however you can't join the server.
---
Great work! My only suggestions so far - sorry if they are in the game and i couldnt find them, 
---
a GUI with toggle-able options. With option to permanently remove auto-hand in. 
---
A minimum-maximum level threshold to show quests above and below your current level
---
Being able to shift-click quests on the map to hide them - for quests that you don't want to do or are bugging out and you cant complete
---
Auto-tracking new quests and ability to track 25 quests
---
holy crap it's brexit all over again
---
Refresh rate and resolution are not the same thing lol
---
Am I the only one who really liked the density of starting zones? I started in the first minutes that it was possible to long in (about 30-40 minutes in?) and I could do the first quests comfortably, even the "kill one mob" kind of quests.
---
I'd trade that for having less populated cities. Also as for cities, the level cap was 15 so there was no incentive to sit in the capitals at all. Not sure what the article author is getting at. He'd probably see 5 more people around him if it wasn't for layering.

I wouldn't say there are any universally must-have addons. These do depend on what you want you want.
---
Don't like the standard UI? Get a UI addon like ElvUI. OR if you jsut dislike parts of the UI replace those, e.g. don't like the unitframes? Get Luna.
---
Do you want messages or icons to pop up easily visible to you? Use WeakAuras to set this up.
---
Do you prefer the guided questing style common in modern RPGs? Questie or ClassicCodex are there for you.
---
And so and so on. Ask yourself, what you feel is missing for your enjoyment of the game and then look for an addon providing that.
---
Correct. Which means they're running virtual servers on their physical ones. The thing you couldn't understand why they wouldn't.

If killing people in world PvP turns out to be against the TOS as you describe, me and my whole guild will quit and you won't have to worry about us
---
&gt; f you dislike layering, worry not. Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1
---
The 11 hour story could happen in every game that has such a rich history as WoW. It has nothing to do with the gameplay.

Soo.... I guess it's gonna be a gamble no matter what. Everyone is hiding their intent.
---
There's a difference between what's intended and what's allowed.
---
The intent of world PvP in World of Warcraft is just that - to create a fun, immersive experience of being in a fantasy world divided by factions at war.
---
The intent in *all* games is *fun*. 2 clearly states that conduct intended to *disrupt* those experiences falls under harassment - and since you decided to bring up intent we should focus in on that. Read the title of this thread, even.
---
It is very clear that the intent is to disrupt these specific users' experience, and so, may be judged accordingly by Blizzard. But you people are okay with it because they're streamers.
---
2 is the very same bit of the ToS that people would use against the streamers. I'm just pointing out if it applies to them it probably applies to anti-streamer ganksquads too.
---
&gt; They confirmed it will be removed by Phase 2 
---
It's not confirmed though, it won't be until Phase 2 is upon us. What is confirmed, however, is that the claim of layering making the entire world one layer is demonstrably false. We have video evidence of shardin- oh sorry, layering, happening upon entrance to Orgrimmar with no other stimuli than a zone change. 
---
So far you only have hope that it will be removed by phase 2, but you have concrete evidence Ion's statement regarding it's function is flat out wrong at best, or a straight up lie at worst.

 Now Im not telling you its faster then shadow! but its doable. Its faster then my pali to kill stuff too.

Reddit: Fuck Streamers let's avoid them by quaranting them to a single server.
---
Also Reddit: Fuck Streamers let's camp them nonstop
---
You might be right. It seems to me the easy fix would be characters cannot switch layers without relogging.
---
Although that comes with the issue of when one layer is full the new one is practically empty until enough people log on. Or relog.
---
Joining the fight against them I guess. Lots of big hirde guilds going to Herod, so I guess it's war. viva la resistance
---
You always expect those people to learn your language tho. Did you make the effort to learn 50 words in those people's languages?

But that's incorrect. The stress test server was almost at 100k people at the same time at peak. Yea there was still 10k queue, but a server without layers could not handle 100k players.

The best would just be to just sort the russians, germans, french and spanish speaking countries based on their IP addresses, and force them onto their own server. They can create characters on the same language servers for free, but there is a 30 EUR fee to create characters on english speaking realms. They do this in League of Legends for EUW and EUE i think where you need to pay to change servers, and issues with russians and people not being able to communicate is non-existent. Except perhaps for the occasional toxic player :P

I don't want people refusing to communicate in english be an issue.

The vast majority of people who have been posting in response to comments like these are looking for something to point the finger at and use as their excuse to hedge their bets for when they realize that classic isn't for them. All that blizz has done right is completely overshadowed by any issue found by the community.
---
What killed retail wasn't Blizzard, it's the community. That same toxic community has a lot of overlap with the classic community, as evidenced by threads like this one.
---
There is about 600 hours of VODs for the stress test that are freely watchable that show nothing like what is in the OP here, yet this thread is filled to the brim that react to the clip with threats and ultimatums.
---
If something like this can break you away from the commitment that is classic then your heart wasn't in having fun playing a game, it was firmly planted in being an anti-blizzard reactionary.
---
People are going to respond to this with downvotes and comments to the tune of, "The entire reason why we wanted Classic in the first place was community and a consistent game world, this is unacceptable. They saw how terrible sharding was on retail, yet implemented here to a detriment to the experience. It's unforgivable."
---
Those comments are stupid. Any reasonable person can see the good that has been done and can see this is a no-win situation for the classic devs. They remove layering and we have 40 day long queues, unless they open up dozens more realms, which will leave a good majority of them dead in six months. It's common knowledge that most people logging in during the first week won't be here in half a year. There are a million reasons for this, there will be tourists, there will be retail players who are curious, there will be a ton of people who just won't be okay with the lack of instant gratification and the pace and content that are present in the leveling experience. The fact is classic will have a ton of players when the numbers normalize, but the normalized number is going to be a tiny percent of the day one loggers.
---
The tl;dr here is that there are fucking gigantic number of people that dominate the forums/reddit/discords/streams/etc that are just wandering around looking for reasons to hate anything blizzard does, and a lot of them are backed by the fear and trepidation in their minds that classic might not be the savior of their gaming lives. They are going to find anything they can to hedge their bets so when they wash out they can point at layering, brazilian players, streamers, not enough servers, AV not being 1.0, etc.
---
No matter how hard you try you're not going to be 15 again, and it will never be 2005.
---
My and my friends are going Golemagg.
---
Hahaha I see it too!
---
Obviously photoshopped as it contradicts the tinfoil hat theory about layering and Reddit is always right.
---
A fucking name vs layering?! You must be insane to think layering is worth it so that we get to keep the god damn names.
---
yea but the rate of English speakers is probably a LOT higher among younger people and even higher among gamers. You can't seriously think only 25% of 20 year old Spanish gamers speak acceptable English.
---
Yeah I mean sure, that experience would suck and they should do everything to avoid that type of situation. Layering is clearly there to alleviate problems and increase QoL in starting areas, anything past that should be left as 'natural' as possible.
---
Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions the other way but do you not think your exact situation was caused because the layering threshold was dramatically lowered to test the system? I highly doubt this would be a problem on live where literally thousands are going to be in the same city. I could be wrong but this just seems like a test server thing and in reality it's going to be super rare and unlikely to see this on live. 
---
I guess what I'm saying is that I can see people's concerns but I can see why other people are just bored and annoyed with the constant whining. Threads like the most popular one at the moment are filled with people saying classic is done for them due to this when with a little bit of a calmer and more reasonable approach it shows they are literally testing it at the moment and it's not a guarantee of what's going to happen on live. Especially when the article the thread is based on uses such a stupid comparison.

---
THIGHMANE
---
&gt;it does not make sense
---
It is. Because main point of layering is to saving on servers.
---
He didnt purposely crashed the server tha fuck are you on about.
---
Being on a pvp server isnt just about ganks, its about being able to contest farming spots in the open world.
---
If you want a farming spot another faction has taken? kill em and show em whos boss. Some dickhead same faction contesting you? wait until a horde/ally kills them, /cheer and /thank unless they want the spot too then you kill them and take the spot.
---
Dude I don't even know who a 'soda' is. Watching any WoW stream sounds boring as fuck to me.
---
And... again, you're trying to have an argument we're not having?
---
I fully agree it applies to them too, and never said otherwise?
---
You've just got such a hate-boner going against these streamers that you only seem capable of expressing yourself through these weird intense biases and preconceptions.
---
You literally even just called me delusional without saying *what about*.
---
Lol. First it was "it'll only be in for launch."
---
Then, "it'll only be in for the first few weeks."
---
Now, "it'll only be in till phase 2."
---
It never ceases to amaze me how people blindly accept whatever they say at face value
---
It would be a great change to be sure, sure to diminish its impact, it will still have a negative one on communities tho and will still be abused to opt out of wpvp, farm etc (even with a CD).
---
This is so sad. What if I'm in a dungeon group and I want to trade someone in IF? I have to leave my group and invite that person just so I can see him? It doesn't make sense.
---
Brian Birmingham: The only thing I really want to call out on layering is a lot of people were wondering if the population thresholds in the beta were accurate, and they're not. There were some people who said, 'Did they just turn this on to test it functionally to make sure it worked?' That's accurate. We set the thresholds much lower on the beta than we would for live because we wanted to make sure we were actually testing the feature. There were other things people pointed out as bugs we were not expecting.
---
if you're talking about finding a guild prior to the launch then there might be a discord already out there for the server with people preparing guilds.
---
that said, i personally wouldnt sign up to guilds prior to the launch (unless you plan on hardcore raiding). When i played on a private server, i got invited to a new guild when I done rfc with the gm, leveled up with the guild, went on to raid with them and had a blast. Im probably to going to do this same this time round.
---
can't we just never leave 'our layer' and if enough other people do the same, we will by default develop those normal friendships and rivalries, just with people from 'our server' (layer) The only difference is that at higher lvls new people will join our world, but the old ones will also still be there.  A lvl 60 from another layer is just like somebody who lvled way faster or slower than you, somebody you had not much interaction with
---
Then why did Blizzard fire up new servers instead of adding more layers?
---

---
Hey mate, what add-on are you using to remove the grypphons near your actions bar ?
---

---
True, but if blizzard can identify someone getting those hundreds of people to falsely report someone, blizzard can take action against that person.  
---
In Alterac Valley, during Wrath, you could report people AFK, and if enough did, it auto booted them before they had a chance to get into pvp combat again.  A guy I knew who played 5 shamans did this all the time and got a 72 hour ban for it.

Not been on reddit the last few days? Was several posts and some videos showcasing it

He pisses me off, honestly. Not a good developer.
---
He is talking about you claiming he did it on purpose, you could have said "swifty was banned" but you said "swifty was banned for PURPOSELY crashing the server" wich is a blatant lie.
---
You do realize the blacklist is only for people who are ganking soda nonstop and intentionally trying to ruin his gameplay right?
---
Like he's not just gonna blacklist everyone he sees for shits and giggles.
---
And I mean, this whole blacklist thing is fucking satire and if you don't realize that I don't even know what to tell you.
---
Exactly my point. It’s not so much the Barrier itself, but the (lack of) effort in trying to reduce the size of that Barrier. If you truly love a game, you will take the time to learn EVERYTHING about it. Learning a new language may be part of that.

CL60 is claiming Mankrik

Holy shit dude youre a special kind of stupid. Alright guess no need to argue. Educate yourself bye

So is stream sniping, its harrassment.

Make servers with shared name database?

ur brain bad, my brain good
---
You know there is a cooldown implemented on layer hopping, right?
---
So my deal Shazzrah for 2 na pvp realm is not good enough? What if I give Alexensual pvp montage on top of that?
---
Server politics are a thing, if you go to a server with the sole purpose of annoying a streamer you get what you deserve.   
---
Its perfectly and 100% allowed to make a black list.
---
\-Some people are trolling on Blizzard's spanish forums saying they're going to Golemagg, but a group of guilds has chosen Shazzrah and they outnumber the trolls by far.
---
\-A famous spanish streamer (Xokas) hasn't said where he and his followers will play.
---
I think there will be more spanish players on Shazzrah.
---
What if all other realms in pool A are full and the merge needs to happen with a server from different pool? That way you still deal with the same issue.
---
You could argue for region-wide character names but a great deal of people would shit their britches at being on server A and not able to name their hunter Legolas since there already is one on server R.

Also, my name is Thex for we are many.

Should be okay with whatever spec you play. Heals do a lot of healing on lower levels IMO.
---
Haha no way, I remember this! I'm Harrinator in the chat
---
A few months ago, i played from 1-60 with a few friend on a priavete server, with i think something like 2.5xp speed, lvling was fun but a little fast, but endgame sucked, most private servers have a in-game store on their site and they sell the best weapons for 20+ euros, so pvp is broken and well there really is no point in raiding and dungeons since most people just buy shit... so thats something to think about :/
---
&gt;If your gonna farm at 60 you should be doing it on a mage or hunter, but thats not what you said right? you wanted a leveling spec that could raid heal?
---
Yea I wanted to mostly heal in raids/dungeons.
---
Thankyu for the advice about specs.
---
&gt;Dwarf priest with skinning prof, disc to 60.
---
I saw people suggest Tailoring for Priests, would you recommend Skinning?
---
some have said they won't announce until right before launch, so even them reserving names doesn't give anything away.
---
http://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
I agree with you. You don't have to speak other language fluently when you just playing game.
---
Link to where this is claimed to have happened?
---
I know you can be muted by mass reports, but never seen any actual evidence of BANS.
---
/s
---
Because the French community was mad that only germans could get their server so after many many post and complains they finally got it.
---
PS: I'm french but I think we should only get EU server so I'm going to pick golemagg or shazzrah
---
" but I’m also 100% against jumping to conclusions "  
---
This is a weak argument, you know DAMN well that its clear if its a snipe or not, if you just chilling in stealth and someone knows your EXACT position in stealth, there is no question.
---
Because they were totally honest about it being gone within the first few weeks after launch. Lmao
---
I think numbers are being blown out of proportion just a bit.
---
While 600,000 people might play classic, I don't belive 600k will be logged in day 1.
---
And certainly not by day 90 or 100.
---
This is so god damn depressing. I played the release of a wotlk private server a couple of months ago and leveling as almost impossible because there were just way too many people to do and I didn't care at all.
---
Just seeing so many people in Elwynn made me happy.
---
Here's the ElvUI project link.

We were talking AoE farming. Why bother moving when you can just abuse a broken system to not have to aye.
---
It's just the Demo guys.
---
It's just the closed Beta guys.
---
It's just the stress test guys!
---
It's only this last stress test guys, they are just tuning the parameters!
---
It's really only the first few weeks!
---
It's only phase 1, guys no need to rage!
---
They will be rid of this in TBC Classic, I'm sure, guys!
---
Guys? Where is everyone?
---
GUYS?!
---
Just look at this.. that many people dedicating their lives to that guy. It's so sad. https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold/clip/SpoopyProudCurryPeteZaroll
---
That is not the same thing lol. It's not even close I guess that's why I was confused.
---
They do? Only 2 servers for EU.
---
If I had to guess, somewhere between 200-300 hours played for most people. This is in the realm of 10 hours a day for a month to get to 60? Maybe my estimates are way off...
---
As an Englishman who learnt one of their languages and then moved there irl, I know where I'm rolling my character.
---
For the sake of truth, spanish community is better now than it was 15 years ago... New generations are more open to communicate in english. Even older generations learned the lesson.
---
Rather play with nords tho
---
Exactly, I don’t think people are quite grasping the reason it’s called a stress test. 
---
Like if you just think about it, it’s fairly obvious that having 100 layers with a single player each on them is a lot more taxing on servers than having a single layer with 100 players. I’m pretty sure Blizzard understand that and wanted to see how many layers they could reasonably run concurrently. Knowing how many layers they can run allows them to be able to adjust the layering thresholds safely on launch for the most Blizzard-like experience.
---
The reason i said 23:00, is because usually the UK is one hour behind me, i live in Denmark, and its 00:01 for us, yes.
---
Well first of all, there is 10 servers (12 if you count Russia)
---
Then we don't know how many players will play and Blizzard can quickly add new server on release day 
---
Finally back in the days, servers had roughly 10-20k players (player base not concurrent players of course) and, as it has been discussed to death, they expect a lot of player to quit the game so it's expected to have 40-50k player on each server at start probably
---
So... don't overthink this and see how it goes. No need to worry about things you don't have the control.
---
8 days /played for a first time with a class is a big maybe. If you're relentlessly grinding and hitting all the right quests and killing mobs while travelling and not doing professions and wasting 0 time and have experience leveling multiple characters in vanilla, and only do dungeon groups when you have all the quests and aren't waiting around for a tank/healer you'll be able to hit it in 8 days /played. From what I can gather from what you're saying, I'd say it will probably be more like 10-12 days /played I'd you're still going semi-hardcore with the leveling.
---
This and the fact that when a new layer is created, say if the threshold per continent is 5k players, then anything more than 5k players on that continent will be in layer 2 --- this means that if there are 5200 players on the continent, the 1st layer will be really populated with 5k players, while the 2nd layer will feel literally empty with just 200.
---
This is by definition how layers work -- in this specific regard, people would miss the CRZ that happens on the live servers, with CRZ the server dynamically adjusts each zone so that it has a healthy amount of players - but wait, people don't wanted CRZ for Classic, so there you go.
---
Because hes not NA and not considered a threath
---
Not really.  I dont' see a difference between legion and bfa. Just different skins.   Wow went down hill when Cataclysm hit.  Recovered with MOP to a greater extent. Then cratered during WOD and really hasn't recovered.
---
Perfect! Going to try it out asap when im home!
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
btw. Are u the author of the addon?

Curse has a filter for Classic addons - many live addons have been updated to support both live and Classic already. Direct link to the filter is here [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A7350&amp;filter-sort=4](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A7350&amp;filter-sort=4)
---
Raknel is talking about the stress test. They were instantly full, and within 15min there was 2 new servers.
---
only people with an active sub can play classic and the classic stresstest that should be over by now.
---
First major class quests and trainers are in SW? Plenty of quests take them there directly after Goldshire? Plenty of people who just want to meme and talk in world chat would be at the first major accessible city? All things that would make sense for a "stress test" where the level cap is 15 and the most common default rolled class for alliance would be human.
---
Let people enjoy what they want to enjoy, why have you got to be a troll
---
And 1-40 is arguably under half of the total leveling time.
---
Minion is cool but doesnt get updated very often
---
Best case is others have quests from those starter zones and you all share

Amen to that
---
Chat isnt layered...
---
Nobody is gonna use a free transfer unless there is a problem on their current server though, or at least not enough people will. If you have 30k people on a layered server with no queue, opening up free transfers to a server with 0 population wont do anything. Only when there is a 10 hour queue to get in will people transfer.
---

And if you use leg to talk about pvp your going to be reported
---
Polish community has chosen Shazzrah as well. Right now, they are a big majority on Burning Legion server (I'm polish, but play on Tarren Mill). You can expect 5k Poles at least.
---
This is 25k+ just from those two communities. I hear that Hungarians are chosing this server as well.
---
Nah just take out layering and you'll make friends with Bob the Orc as you two wait to tag a quest mob for 3 days.
---
Just let Blizzard do their Thing. They SHOULD have enough data and experience to be able to have good guesses. And if  they are wrong I am sure they have some Kind of back-up plan.
---
I mean we always joke about Blizzard - but they are one of the longest Standing gaming companies with millions of Players. They can't be that bad at their Job :P

Just let it be - enjoy the game and let Blizzard do the number crunching

Atleast 4k "confirmed" according to the nordic community website.
---
That is what I don't get.  Legion is objectively not different at all from BFA.  All BFA is a different skin, with a inferior story.  But the mechanics are pretty identical for the most part.  Classes might play slightly differently but everyone else int he game is copy and paste.  Hell I don't consider WOD really any different then Legion either.  A lot of the same mechanics also exist in that expansion.  Frankly WOW hasn't been enjoyable since MOP.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold/clip/SpoopyProudCurryPeteZaroll

For me personally. Collecting gold for my first mount is going to be the priority. I think this is a safe bet for the majority of players as well. That 60%increased movement speed is a massive deal for the grind from 40-60.

Ive been eating salad
---
Welcome to classic :)
---
Not really. They can use layers to put 100k ppl into one server if they want to (obviously they wont) and completely remove any number of queues.
---
The problems start when they packed TOO many players in same server and they have to get RID of layering (like they promised). Then you will see queues.
---
I'd argue if you're trying to speedlevel, I wouldn't even do rfc. For the level 30+ dungeons it would probably be more efficient to get every quest, but I feel like unless you really need an item to boost your leveling speed I would just skip RFC.
---
I don't want new classic I want classic classic, this whole thing is a big turn off for me and I won't be playing it.
---
Blizz has been fantastic every time I've needed their assistance
---
r/Donald posters built a reputation for "trolling" and "triggering" people, but let the tables turn on them and it's always "I can't believe this is what's become of society!" If you don't want people looking down on you for posting there, either stop doing it or get an alt.
---
Didn't they say that the right click reporting system won't be automatic and different than retail's? Even if someone gets reported by hundreds of people then it won't ban the person instantly.
---
Yea, they could do it 15 years ago but not today. That's horseshit.
---
And what if the entire reason for the stress test was to see how many LAYERS could be active at once?
---
Have you considered that Blizzard wanted to know that information so they could reasonably tweak that number of layers ahead of launch to give the most Blizzard-like experience?
---
This makes me so glad to play on a eu realm, and a german realm at that.
---
I feel with you, my American friends #takemyenergy
---
Classic runs on the BfA modern client and will use BfA addons (each addon has to manually be updated to support both BfA and Classic). What you were using on the private servers was literally the 1.12 client from 2006, which needed addons from 2006.
---
Curse has a [filter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A7350&amp;filter-sort=4) for the addons already updated to support Classic.
---
Depends what you mean by worth it. From simply a time perspective it's not worth it to dungeon at all unless you have a dedicated group. Just remember any time flying or traveling is at a cost to your speed. Not just the time picking up a quest from say thunder bluff but the time it takes to turn it in as well. There may be a few exceptions for weapons like the crescent staff. Shaman can use that thing for 10+ levels and so it might be worth it.
---
Ah gotcha.  Yeah I would like some improvements in that respect also, the problem is they wouldn't stop there once they start changing things.  I did my hardcore time in bc and it was great.  The balance in bc was excellent I thought, if we get there I'd be happier.  Better yet do bc but without flying mounts.
---
&gt;94% upvote ratio and the top posts from the last 24 hours are a single meme and 6 posts about how layering will destroy classic, all with &gt;90% upvote ratios. The majority of people on forums/discords/twitch/reddit are trying to kill the game in it's cradle like they did with BFA. This is exactly what happened last august with the launch of that expansion.

It's also a performance optimisation. When you enter into a city proper, the ground mesh is no longer rendered, allowing a much higher polygon budget.
---
Original WoW was designed to run on anything with more GPU capability than an actual fresh potato.
---
I love how many of you are delusional to how toxic these people are.
---
So I'm going priest, it's possible to gear shadow just from PvP? On phase 1 I will probably heal but at some point I'm going to respec for PvP
---
Well we've no way to know how many people were interested in standing in Ironforge for this test, surly they're off testing classes etc.  
---
\-BUT- 
---
I would love some clarification from Blizzard on how Layering in ment to work, I noticed it when I ran into Ironforge with 2 other players (no in my party) they phased out for a second so we all obviously switch layers it was my understanding laying only happens when joining groups, instancing or move continents.
---
&gt;I also see you are a TD poster, try not to shoot up blizzard when layering goes live and you don't get your way, since thats what you alt righters seem to be into nowadays.
---
Grow up, Thats a disgusting thing to say.
---
Ye man trump memes are funny imagine living in the US lul
---
Only pull packs of 4+ mobs
---
Yes. I agree with this statement.
---
As long as there're more than one layer it's gonna completely ruin the feeling of an authentic classic experience. Like when raids happen, you're gonna have to spam general to get invited to various groups hoping you'll end up in the correct layer where the hordes are attacking goldshire etc
---
Honestly, you can play wow without basic communication only. I've ran dungeons with russians on pservers that didn't speak a word of english, and I don't speak a word of russian. 
---
Why it's such a big deal imo is that wow is a very slow game, and people tend to chat a lot. It's not really fun when you're in a dungeon and you can't talk to your party members. It's like you're playing solo, it's a weird feeling.
---
I've leveled to 11, 5 and 9 last 24 hours and I already love all three. Hope they get sweet dreams when the plug is pulled on them. :')

Rp-pvp server is claimed for people that want to play on a Rp-pvp server
---
Hurray we harassed someone to the point they couldn't play the game. What fun. Fucking retards
---
Genuine quality post. Thank you!
---
Not having escape artist is gonna suck. Humans don't really have any good PvP racials aside from perception which is still not all that great.
---
I'd say if your sole purpose is to min max PvP, roll horde or gnome. 
---
If you're dead set on human and you'd rather be a human than min max, play a human and don't care about it.
---
There is might be need to test something out. Like, server initialization-startup process.
---
Also, there is also other resources which layers, ofcourse, share. Log in service, database, and so on. And such resources while don't take huge load in middle of server live, but under high load when a lot of people logging in, creating characters, and so on. To fully test out real server performance (not an server by game term, but hardware) or infrastructure, they sure should remove suck bottlenecks atleast temporary.
---
well , people were saying stop layering for months now. now its obviously to late to remove it. shouldve listened to the community much much earlier and just add more servers / merge them later on
---
but just remove layering, it will kill classic if it stays.
---
Ok, I'm usually the one to criticize layering, but this specific problem (of empty cities) that is for unknown reason gaining more traction than any other "layering-connected" problem is actually not a problem at all. And before you scroll down to angrily disagree, please read everything I have to say. 
---
Layering program attempts to divide playerbase into "optimal" numbers - so that questing is still possible, yet the world feels alive. 
---
However, in this specific stress test, maximum level is 15. On Horde side, majority of playerbase is sitting in Durotar and small part of Barrens. This is overall a really small area. Try to pack even 2000 people there, and it will be chaos (I know some would want this chaos, but its not BlizzLike and/or VanillaLike - no more than disconnects and queues). 
---
So, the size of single layer needs to be very small. You see huge amounts of people moving and questing around you and you project this view on whole Azeroth - however, during the stress test, every other zone is completely empty. Tanaris - empty. Plaguelands - empty. Desolace - empty. Overall, the total amount of players in the layer is very small. It needs to be. As it is the beginning of leveling, and whole playerbase is concentrated in 1 small area.
---
And then, lets say, 5% of total players on the realm is chiling in Org at a given time. 
---
With such small layers this is not a lot. It generally amounts to the view you see on screenshots. 
---
However, when players spread over whole continents, a single layer will contain much more players - maybe even 20x more. What that means, is 20x more people in Orgrimmar. Suddenly doesn't sound too bad, does it? 
---
As for common complains:
---
1) I see hundreds on people on /who yet noone is around me, fix this Blizzard!!!! 
---
Dude, when using /who function you are browsing through 200k megaserver. 20x bigger than populations of big pservers. OF COURSE you will find thousands of people in any location or level. That doesn't mean you should see all of them. This isn't VanillaLike. You have a small community to work with, not big-city simulator. 
---
2) Blizzard should stop layering in cities so they are always crowded!
---
This is just objectively bad idea for multiple reasons. First, It would cause you to encounter hundreds of people you literally never saw before - because they leveled on different layers. Each time you enter the city you recognize only 10% players, EACH TIME. It is completely destructive to community. What's more, you would see a constant stream of people entering and leaving the cities, appearing and disappearing into nothingness as soon as you try to accompany them - immersion breaking. Finally, imagine seeing all these people and deciding to create multiple 40-man raids with them in order to attack Stormwind. So your 160-man army leaves the city and... 75% of it disappears because they consist of players that were never supposed to be in the same layer. 
---
3) Cities are supposed to look like this: "links Nostalrius screenshot".
---
Actually... they don't. And that's not news. Nostalrius housed total population multiple times bigger than most populated Vanilla realms. No realm in Vanilla looked like Nostalrius did, ever. I know that many people prefer the Nostalrius way. However, its NOT AUTHENTIC. Don't blame Blizzard for recreating AUTHENTHIC experience! Cities in Classic will NOT look like cities in most pservers, and they were never supposed to! At best they will have 20% of what you see in pservers screenshots, much less in hours when most players sleep.

---
Everyone is overblowing the streamer thing. There may be some congestion while leveling at launch or during a streamer event, but besides that it will really just be like having another guild on the server. People are freaking out for no reason. Also, with the whole blacklist thing, it's not really gonna happen. It's just too much of a logistical nightmare and hassle to put together, they're just fucking around. Realistically , the only thing that you won't be able to do is maybe get scarab Lord or something because of gear funneling, but that effects almost no one.
---
From what I know most of the danish guilds stick to themselves. A few guilds have come together due to a lack of members willing to raid though.
---
Sapper chargers are for raid dps...
---
Can't deal with the troll toes
---
Human Warlock was my first ever character in Vanilla. Will you be a little less strong due to the other warlocks? Yes. Will it matter too much in the end? No.
---
Just go with the race youwl want, you ll have to look at your character for hundreds of hours.
---
do you think being a human lock is worse then being a human mage. im just wondering how big of an impact this stuff will have
---
Grass growing everywhere, including on roads = not kosher
---
&gt; Even saw some friends get layered on another layer while they were in the raid pvping.
---
Well, obviously you hit the limit of that layer in the stress test then. If any layer can technically hold up to 3k ppl, i dont see this being a problem after release. 
---
God know what they used as the limit in the stress test. It might have been much, much lower.
---
Kargoz goes over class benefits in his [class picking guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4). It's basicalyl a tl;dr, but might be good enough for what you want.
---
Sort of yes is the answer. There will be times where having escape artist could save your life but its not make or break for the class. I'm in the same fight with myself about playing a NE priest. It's a double handicap because priests have extra racials so idk.
---
Would love to have a source on that but yeah if it's like that then it won't be a problem hopefully.
---
&gt; I know this has been beaten like a dead horse  
---
If you know that, you already know the answer to this.  
---
We are getting a recreation of Vanilla, which is called Classic Wow.  
---
Anything new or changed or different is up for debate in /r/classicwowplus
---
&gt; over something that's likely to have no impact on live.
---
This is simply not true. It undermines and destroys the exact thing that Classic WoW was famous for. It's quite likely it will damage the community before it even got the chance to get off the ground.
---
That's why people are "being toxic". This is really, really bad, and they want to draw attention to it. Not a little bit of attention, a lot of attention.
---
Classic is about to come out. We've said for over a decade that we don't like CRZ and phasing. That's one of the primary reasons why many went to private realms in the first place.
---
This isn't the first opportunity - this is the last opportunity. The game is releasing in 14 days. This is no time to be beating around the bush.
---
Unless there are people threatening the developers, which I haven't seen, I really don't see the issue. I'm sorry you feel this way.
---
Might want to ask those questions on the [actual forum](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/reserve-your-name-in-wow-classic-on-august-12-at-22-00-gmt-august-13-at-00-00-cest).
---
He thinks blizz should guarantee streamers should get the names they want. And that blizz should ban people banking streamers. He's as entitled as the rest of them, they all want special treatment.
---
I can't find the exact post right now but Blizzard has confirmed that names will not be 'claimed' for any duration after character deletion.
---
Wolf energy
---
Probably won't be since no one know which servers streamers are picking yet. Most likely the site won't be correct before after launch
---
Layering and sharding are more or less the same concept. I think there's a few differences technically but it's easier to just treat as the same.
---
I have been playing west coast servers since TBC. I never noticed lag etc 70-75 MS max.
---
They were playing with the thresholds for layering - that was the entire purpose of the test. Who even thought they'd test this on the test server, right?
---
So instead of saying Blizz has no idea, why don't you admit that you have no idea?
---
**Players will not be randomly moved to another layer on release**, but only at login or when changing continents..
---
It's closer than Classic itself is right now.
---
Alright so this stroke me a bit since I'm doing something similar. Might not mean much to most people but here we go;
---
I quit hash and weed. I have been 10 years smoking it on a daily basis, currently 1 month free. I've also started working out at home, nothing too crazy but I feel much better, and also trying to eat more. I usually skipped many meals.
---
I have re-done my schedule and go early to sleep. I am enjoying watching shows and other things I would not have enjoyed before. Also I'm taking a course about anxiety reduction and it's doing wonders for me. It's doing more for me than my psychologist to be honest.
---
And I'm actually starting to study as I was supossed to. I won't be able to play at launch because of my finals... and it made me very sad (seeing everyone is going to be playing like crazy at launch), but I overcomed it and I learnt it's not the end of the world. I also will be able to play very little every day as I *have* to start doing my obligations, but I'm really looking forward to it.
---
See you a few weeks after launch, folks.
---
yup! take skinning and only skinning. you dont sell the leather you vender it. You need to be looking at enough gold at 40 to get the mount and at 60 to be near/at getting the epic mount. skinning will get you there IF you dont waste your money.
---
 Mining and herbing may seem tempting, but you have to level those! and the starter zones will be full of people strip mining them. Leveling them will be instead of leveling your char (as opposed to just leveling up with you like skinning). So dont take them on a healer/tank toon! make a gathering alt like a druid or hunter if you want to do that.
---
 Now tailoring: often paired with enchanting... its a mistake. Its expensive in terms of opportunity cost. While you level throw ALL cloth you get on the ah. It WILL sell and you really need the silver it will bring in. later at 60 or with a 2nd farm alt you can get the cloth to level tailor, but for now? you want to sell cloth not have to buy it... or even worse farm it: on a healer... shudders.
---
 I will make a tailor. Might well be my priest. It wont be until shes 60 though. I'll just go holy nova stockades 6 times an hour, way way faster then trying to wand down a defias rogue for the 20% chance to drop 2 linen. Or I will get the cloth on my hunter. Priorities first though: you need your mounts.
---
The difference here is in cataclysm there was a shit ton of servers to choose from and overall population was healthy enough to have them all decently populated. Once population problems started happening? They introduced more and more cross-realm features to deal with it. As of retail right now, realms only matter for the most recent raid on Mythic Difficulty.
---
So what if Blizzard removes layering and adds more servers? Then you better be great at gambling, because 45 of the 50 servers will be dead after 1-6 months from all the tourists leaving. You spent weeks /played on your character? well congrats, you either need to buy a server transfer (if they exist), wait/hope that blizzard merges servers soon, reroll on another server (haha... yeah), or just quit yourself.
---
See the problem here? Buying a server transfer sucks and makes your realm identity get ruined. Waiting for servers to merge could be a few months and come with their own set of problems (naming, server identity issues yet again...). Rerolling on another server is likely the worst option and hopefully I don't need to explain why. Lastly, quiting sucks.
---
Layering isn't perfect, but it handles most of that. Even if ~80% of players quit, all servers should be pretty healthy. Not so many people quitting? It's a lot better to open up a little more servers (while still having problems). And lastly, from my understanding blizzard has stated that layers in the stress test are *much* smaller. Of course org is going to look empty when a layer has 300-500 people scattered across all of azeroth. Once layers have 2500+ (like it will at launch unless they are lying to us) cities will be much more populated.
---
That's true. I also don't appreciate trolls emitting a frog sound when they receive a critical hit. I might roll a hunter though, really like his posture when firing bows.
---
Yes for sure but largely because blink is a better escape than idk how of terror.
---
Well 4k Players thats more than a Vanilla realm. WE NEED MORE SERVERS IN THE EU
---
Wouldn't be surprised if some people would do throwaway account just to abuse report. 
---
And it won't solve it for streamer because for some fans, getting a one 1week suspension is worth it if it mean helping their favourite streamer.
---
In which way?
---
Have fun mate
---
This will literally keep me off retail and then they'll be like see you guys didn't want classic after all to justify the failure.
---
Expect a lot of childish immature, toxicity in the community. Also alot of racist and mysogonstic rhetoric.
---
EU has 4, check again. They had to double the amount to fit players in.
---
Thank you, I will give it a look, after work
---
Just save your name, then wait a few days.  At that time it should be safe to delete and create a new one taking your time
---
Nothing, it's just the copy pasta is from 4chan where moderators are called janitors :p
---
How does that work ? You don’t join any servers but your name is basically saved on all of them?
---
fakk, can't the spaniards go to golemagg instead
---
yes it was a shitshow, but people still played the shit out of it. despite lag/crashes and it was FINE.
---
You know that this isnt permanent solution, right ? Its for the launch, so they can pack more people to the server than the long run capacity at launch (because a lot of people will quit).
---
Those pics break my heart...
---
As long as Zandalar Tribe never gets mentioned by any of them I'm happy.
---
its not like these people will talk non English in general and trade chat.  
---
Its their native language.

Last Stress Test
---
one of my favorite wow memories was crushing players in southshore. I was a cow shaman and I would just roll into southshore, die to the guards, and then hover near ally quest givers as a ghost. level 25 alliance shows up, I just pop rez and suprise motherfucker those kids dead. was this at all conducive to my own progress? fuck no, the repair bills were stupid.
---
He shouldn't have to? Not sure you realise the utility of layering. You can't really play the game when 8000 people are in Elwynn or Stormwind. This is infinitely better than in october having all empty realms and then having to randomly merge 4-5 of them together.
---
holy shit i havent heard from you in years dude WHAT HAPPENED TO UR BEARD
---
I still considered WoD an enjoyable expansion, but tbh it was 100% carried by challenge modes for me. I'm sad that they got replaced by mythic dungeons in legion.
---
Unfortunately layering can't work like that. Each layer has to be an entire world (or maybe there are entire continents, I'm not certain which)
---
Exempting cities would make it sharding. Which I think was the original plan, but people complained that sharding wasn't in classic.
---
So they have been using sharding AND layering, naughty naughty blizzard!
---
so because they someone takes gold from random people you're going to gank them to the point where they can't play the game and then act like you're the mature one?
---
lol im Noose the orc who killed the guy streaming. rofl. WHAT AN END TO A STRESS TEST! GG ALL!
---
The amount pf layers don't even matter. As long as they have more than more layer in main cities it will totally ruin raiding etc
---
To add to what the others said, I don't think there are very many unguarded treasure chests in the game. It's a nice idea and it could be good gold in theory but you'd need to find one of the treasure chests that you can get to fairly easily and with no mobs around it. I don't know every chest spawns in the game but I really doubt that it's a possibility.
---
You could go for the STV arena chest, but you won't be uncontested for it.
---
Sweet spirit bond bro
---
True
---
Servers will be fine. With Layering, there is absolutely no issue adding more hardware to accommodate more players. 
---
What will not be fine, however, is the game experience. I did defend layering in the past, and will continue to defend it for the sole purpose of making early leveling bearable. If I am still stuck on a megaserver with 20k people at level 30+ and can only interact with a fraction of those, I'm gonna quit. Classic is about people and community, that's the one reason why people want it back. 10k+ servers, and we're back to anonymous everyone-for-himself of retail (just worse, because if you already have anonymous servers, sharding is the better tech, and the group finder system is designed to prevent ninjalooting and griefing).
---
But I thought no more GMs? Default to Perma-Ban?
---
I can't find the link right now but I'm pretty sure they said it somewhere on the forums or in an interview. I'll keep searching.
---
Race is BIS for hunters. But you made of rofl with the frog reference /memories
---
Since its an RP-Server I think you guys are prop fine! :)
---
Just keep in mind that the launch will have its problems, give it some days and judge then.
---
It's pretty easy. You can heal as shadow while leveling
---
Why the APES hate? As a Horde player I would not mind playing on the same server as APES at all! Fun to have some targets running around :D
---
:)
---
Any way to quit drugs, alcoholism or any other "problem" is not stupid but encouraging and praiseworthy! Hope you stay this way and have a great time in WoW! :)

DoA

Thanks to sharding, you wont even notice any other players!
---
Erm, no.
---
Same. Been playing lots of Dark souls 3. Then I come here at night await my new addiction
---
The finnish horde and alliance coalitions have for now also chosen Shazzrah as their server. The server choice may change if there are more servers published before the launch. This amounts to rougly 1600+ players in total.
---
&gt; nords 
---
Victory, or Sovngarde!

 Killing their own game, classical  blizzard.

So we remove Norway?

Already Surrendering the server huh? Classic frenchies.
---
and what about gearing?
---
May I invite you to the french community discord server for Auberdine (PvE) to chat about this with us?
---
[https://discord.gg/SqENZvu](https://discord.gg/SqENZvu)
---
if you were around at the original launch of WoW, we also had 1-5 hour queues, server crashes , lags, and all that, and STILL people played the shit out of it. i would take all of that instead of layering in a  heartbeat. im sure im not the only one.
---
LOKTAR OGAR!
---
Can confirm brazilians are not the best to play with .
---
Name the game and Brazilians are always more toxic and agressive .
---
There are really 2 opposite solutions here - either have CRZ, heavily phasing/auto-balancing each zone for a healthy amount of players in the zone ---- either no phasing, everyone on the same phase, 8k people in SW, after 2 months all the realms being empty, Blizz having to merge 5-6 realms in order to have a healthy population again.
---
Whatever you choose, the next person next to you will choose the other option.
---
Or like me just pick a PVE server and play the game in peace.
---
This guy maths
---
Opinion about streamers, people giving things to streamers in exchange of nothing (everyone knows this has happened on pservers) should be considered RTM.
---
Im a bit sad. Im spanish and i dont undertand why so much hate againts my community.
---
All communities have retarded players, its not spanish comminity exception...
---
LOL. So essentially if you become a stalker, you will be punished? No way.
---
I say a clip of a player running into org from durotar and it put him in a new layer as soon as he entered the city. Isn't that sharding in that case? You're right, shard=zone, layer=world.
---
Agree. There was at least 200 people in the noob zone, durotar, when I started. It wasn’t laggy at all however there were groups of 20 or more people camping spawns like sarkoth. There was probably 50 people constantly standing where you spawn after character creation and 50 or 60 in the immediate vicinity. It was crazy busy.
---
They arent refunding you anything. Theyre granting you unused days that you payed for back onto the account. The only reason I can speak with specificity on that is because I initially asked for an actual refund but was told it cannot be done, but game time could be credited back to the account.
---
No, it was being unable to get into the game for hours of crashing servers followed by a very mediocre population with little to no struggle competing for anything. 
---
If I'm dealing with crashing servers anyway why can't I get a more authentic launch experience and feel like I'm actually a part of something special? If I wanted mediocre populations and little to no competition why wouldn't I just play weeks after launch?
---
I think it might be a twitch thing in general too because like you say he sort of takes ages to express something that could have been expressed in like 3 words.  And during that time he interrupts himself by responding to chat every few seconds.  Makes it incredibly difficult to follow.  His youtube stuff (which isn't just clipped from twitch) is a lot better imo.
---
Yes, but the decay was around 70% and it was over 3-4 months, the "biggest" reason for the decay being, people just trying it out but losing interest and that the game really had no end-game content and there was no plan to release anymore content, so there was no reason to keep playing once you had reached your initial goal.  
---
Classic wow will have phases with new end-game content coming out over time, which will most likely help quite a bit with keeping players.   
---
So from that i would assume that it will hold on to players for longer than runescape managed to do it. But still a lot of people throw out that they're gonna lose 80% or more of the launch playerbase in a month, which to me seems like a really high percentage and seems very very unlikely.
---
this channel isnt working for me
---
Viking honor
---
Shazrah it is then
---
It's been stated that a layer will be the size of a whole vanilla server from back in the day. How is it going to damage the community especially when it'll be turned off eventually? And again, drawing attention to bugs is great, but attention is being thrown at this 'alone in cities' issue which just won't be the case on live servers. It doesn't take alot to research and realise some obvious things such as the threshold being considerably lowered on the stress test. Instead though people writhe around kicking and screaming. I get that the authentic experience has to be catered to as exact as possible and it's hugely important for alot of people but come the fuck on, stress test layering examples is all people have to go crazy about?
---
Many arrows shall properly hit knees!
---
That's a good way of putting it. That's exactly what it feels like.
---
I've seen people pay hundreds of dollars for an in game name. Just because it doesn't matter to you doesn't mean that's the case for others.
---
That will happen in 13 hours and you also need an active sub to reserve name.
---
Is there actually a way to not use layering at all? Is  it possible to have a stabil game experience without it? I am just wondering if layering is just the result of the big player amount or if blizzard just want to save server performance and therefore money.
---
Uh I'm so gonna follow this!
---
Then they will turn off layers like they said they would. You then have a 10 hour queue so people will move.
---
Yup. This actually convinces me.
---
Or it would.. if I wasn't from EU.
---
Yeah whatever happened to "it will only be in the starting zone" lmao
---
Yep, layering is the worst technology blizzard has ever developed. It is so shitty to play an MMO and have nobody around. I skipped this expansion because it was just shit leveling and seeing like 2-3 people...
---
That could be another reason why I don’t understand the big issue.
---
I love playing alone. I always have music/comedy podcasts in the background as I play. Wouldn’t even make a difference to me. I can now see that this could be a issue to somebody more social, though.
---
you need an active sub even for the name reservation. if thats not worth to you / your name is unique enough i wouldn't consider subbing early just for your name (it's essentialy a preorder bonus) and you lose 2 weeks of game time.
---

Abusive behaviour - that just sounds like a streamer.

Not sure if this helps you but you can use the WoW Classic dressing room feature to decide what customization you want so it's faster to select when reserving your name
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room
---
It will be near impossible for most people. You'll need a guild very supportive of you being shadow. Your set pieces are basically all +healing so your fighting locks and mages and any other caster meme specs for the other pieces
---
Whats the best race to get to the chest for Alliance?
---
Come see us on our server and we'll see who surrenders in PvP &lt;3
---
Exactly
---
Really? If i have to be honest im spanish and im a bit dissaponinted to see so much hate against our community.
---
I guess you must have a real reason to hate us.
---
I haven't seen much of Asmon, but from his interactions with Destiny and his reaction to Destiny's talk with JLP that seems really inaccurate. But I can see how you'd get that impression from him, and 100 fold for his fanbase.
---
Every child is taught to remember the emu war we will not forget .
---
Well, Swifty for example got once banned for making the server crash. Asmongold has done it many times where his army of fanboy completely lagged the server, yet not a single ban for him.
---
because those who are playing the stress test are the retail players, they know nothing else.
---
Ends Today^TM
---
I just wasted 1:17mins of my life for this?
---
Eh, could just swop a flag, and faces for flags for the EU :(
---
Yea. You need to download the wow classic client and you need an active subscription.
---
True that gonna edit it in.
---
Shadow priests could get spots in raids, mainly to give the shadow damage debuff and boost the warlocks DPS, but yeah that'd be 1 SP in the raid and that's it. So you can play SP at 60, don't worry, just be ready to get some "no" while looking for a raid spot, unless you already have a guild counting on you.
---
As a SP you can also be a PVP god, as SP were known as the face melters. They were pretty insane 1v1 back then.

Cause we don't grow up with everything in the world dubbed.

That was my thought on it, but I wanted to double check. I thought the stress test had ended days ago.

---
It is quite unique which I would love to get. Im willing to pay 7 euro for the good feeling that will last for some time
---
I think *some* are worth doing but not at the cost of slowing down your leveling. There are times where you will have all the quests, spamming for a group, but questing will just be a better use of your time rather than standing around waiting for a group to form up. I think if there are specific rewards you can really benefit from then definitely go do the dungeon but otherwise just quest
---
What they described is modified sharding, and what people are seeing doesn't match their previous claims. They may have miscommunicated, they may have failed to implement layering as they intended, but there's nothing wrong with believing they're going to do what they say. If it's like this at launch there will be a firestorm.
---
so i dont have to heal anymore at 60 or what?
---
Blizz should change some pve to pvp
---
2-3 pve is enough.
---
Do we even need layering? Was layering in vanilla wow?

I think they mean that you'll be able to go to the character creation screen and see the character(s) you've created. However you can't actually log in on those characters until the official release.
---
Does that make sense?
---
yes, in almost every game I run into spanish ppl they spam "jajajajaajajaajaj" in chat, they never even try to speak english and they're not very good at the game.
---
Shouldn't be layering period.
---
Wow. I can’t wait to run a dungeon with one of the 32 Shaman tanks leading the way. ;)
---
Shocking, honestly, considering the cable infrastructure in Australia
---
Horde rouges will love it
---
Except that Vanilla private servers have a certain capacity that they can't surpass. I don't think they can go over 3000. Even on a brand new Vanilla private server launch it would be impossible to level up even if only 500 Alliance and 500 Horde players log in at the same time.
---
I've done this on a Vanilla private server launch, I was in Teldrassil as a Nigh Elf Rogue or Hunter and while I was excited at the prospect of playing on the launch of a brand new server, being unable to complete quests and having to grind with mobs is not that fun. It's a regression back to the days of Asian grinder MMOs like Lineage 2, Metin2 and others where killing hundreds of the same mobs on end is THE WAY to progress in the game, because the developers weren't capable enough to develop a solid quest system.
---
1. Struggling to find mobs to kill is not a "sterile experience" it's a huge flaw in the design of the game and the accommodation of high number of newly created characters all starting in the same location.
---
2. This is a flaw that exists from a time when it was technologically impossible to accommodate players better.
---
3. It's lore-unfriendly to have at least 200 Humans all logging in at the same time in Northshire Abbey and competing for mobs, creating raids and whatnot. How do you explain this? That's right, you can't, because no Warcraft lore details such a massive influx of adventurers appearing out of nowhere at the same time and place. It feels actually like a large crowd of immigrants got through the border and are starting to work and settle and creating chaos everywhere around them.
---
You and me have experienced this event at a smaller scale on private servers. Now if you look at the polls and how many people vote for them, then multiply them by at least 3 and I can guarantee you that a server like Shazzrah will have at least 10,000 players at launch, that's roughly 1200 people per race logging in in the starting zone at the same time. If you see them all at the same time, even if you have a NASA alien technology supercomputer, you will probably get FPS drops and your game might even crash. Then comes the part where all mobs will be instantly killed and you won't be able to level at all - you will go into Elwynn Forest, but so will 1000 more people.
---
In the end, your "sterile experience" will make the game impossible to play and I am glad you aren't the one in charge of WoW Classic, because I want to play WoW Classic, not some chaos that obsolutely nobody will enjoy simply because it would be impossible to play.
---
The result will be everyone leaving but a few most dedicated people. The WoW Classic launch is a huge failure, Blizzard gets even more bad reputation, stocks start dropping massively and so on and so on...
---
TL;DR I'm glad you aren't in charge of WoW Classic.
---
Then why the fuck do they do it? It destroys the game experience.
---
thanks, added
---
You seem to have already made up your mind but if you’re a a decent dude finding a guild shouldn’t be an issue at all. There’ll be guilds for everyone, most guilds in classic don’t even exist yet. Country/language specific guilds, mixed guilds, hardcore ones, casual ones etc. You’ll find one that suits you. I find the ping sacrifice you’re gonna have to make much worse than the occasional interaction with a non-english speaker (which you will have on NA anyway as well).
---
You don't know that it's not working as intended because you don't know the intent of their test.
---
yeah imagine watching something for entertainment, what losers
---
Exactly. The fire is beyond control now. They will be hunted 24/7.
---
I think we will see some of them give up and stream with a massive delay.
---
I have windows 10 and I found out it was the overlay on by background apps! (Discord, Razer Synapse, GeForce experience, etc.) 
---
Make sure they’re all turned off :) hopefully it works man!
---
They said that last Stress Test already, no clue why all the panic and hate comes up again.
---
Oh it would 100% be me lol, 500 ms isnt fun on EU servers.
---
Perhaps some people take it too far, but most of us just find them a tiresome distraction. Although I’ve got to be honest I’d rather scrub toilets then come home and play games than play games for a living. What they do would take all the fun out of games for me.
---
I det mindste kan man selv lave grupper i WoW, i modsætning til Mobas hvor man er fanget med en dude der snakker fransk/spansk/russisk til sig selv hele spillet.

---
If all else fails, you can try deleting the chat cache, which can be found at

1 person tells me its cheaper and 1 say it more expensive, im pritty sure you guys don't know shit either.
---
Im currently at work so I dont know if he said something since I have evrything mute!
---
Bonus points if you send them to people
---
Thanks just downloaded and looks like I’ll be waking up 30 min before
---
This was how it was in vanilla too
---
I guess the already announced servers are there. Create characters on the ones you want, but you can't "Enter world". That's what seems logical to me atleast. GL
---
I think cities will look more populated at launch because everyone will subscribe then. Now only the most dedicated are subscribing. My expectation is at launch there will probably be 4 times more people.
---
Do you get tired of purposefully seeking out a specific game forum to tell people what they can and can't say or think?
---
Yes it does and it's worse than ever. But keep planning routes for stuff that won't exist, while I'll enjoy my dead layered server.
---
Yikes.
---
LOOOOOL THIS IS AMAZING! I love it!
---
No one cares
---
&gt;It has to be typed exactly as posted above: /join LookingForGroup And yes, the channel name for blizzards channels are case-sensitive.
---
No it's not.
---
Aye sure, just search for night elf to dun morogh shortcut or something on YouTube. Sorry but cba finding it myself
---
I mean blizzard giving them the names is the best option. Anyone that uses a streamer name is just going to have to change it because they can be used to scam players.
---
If you're serious about things and with that guide, you should be able to see something like 6-8 days /played. But competition and crowding will definitely throw that off by a lot if you're unlucky.
---
I followed Joana's guide on a hunter once, and I also got to 60 in 2 weeks. Note that this was just after TBC release. It took me easily 10-15 hours a day. After that I was so burnt out by the hunter, leveling and the game in general, I took a break for a month or so :P
---
To achieve that kind of speed, you really need to have no distractions, no chatting, no idling, no dungeons, no professions. Just full-on, constant, questing, grinding and doing exactly what the guide tells you. It's definitely not a fun way to level, and I would highly recommend not doing it for your first time experience, unless your only goal is to get to raids as soon as possible.
---
Ah this post again
---
Do you just like the idea of playing a priest or something?
---
Well it's easy. Spanish community is toxic, and many of them can't speak any English at all. That coupled with the size of the country, means they can easily ruin global chat channels.
---
They're not. Private server players are delusional.
---
APES is going where dodgers are going.
---
Probably not. The vast majority of players don't really care about their character name that much to reserve them ahead of time.
---
*Waiting for private server to steal classic code and make a proper server without layering bullshit*
---
No layering is probably what they're referencing.
---
Well I was hoping he could give me some reason, I try to keep an open mind. But this might be the only real answer I will get on the topic.
---
What class should I choose if I want to have the most fun while playing solo?
---
Your hate is huge dude. If you are british, i can say the same for your community. 
---
But you are the who is creating hate with no reason.
---
Thanks.
---
Buy her stardew valley, it's a game thats appealing to alot of women.
---
Are u guys sure u know wat ur talking about
---
anyone hav water?
---
*burned by this nasty line*
---
Which nasty line? The one that gets uttered 600 times a day? The one that instantly paints you as a fucking moron because it's just that unoriginal?
---
6 months later there's still layering. Turns out 90% of wow players main classic wow.
---
Sounds like the tourists are the real problem then. Maybe just offer the game to the people who actually asked for it and have confirmed accounts that played in vanilla.
---
Catering to casuals and tourists is what seems to have caused all of the problems ever after all
---
shadow priests are very good in pvp and i want to be a dwarf. so they go together very well
---
Yawn
---
So maybe they should clarify so people won't speculate? Judging by past experience with BfA people have every right to be concerned.
---
The 20 or so people in my guild don't want to play on a streamer server.  Of the 50 or 60 other friends I have joining Classic from guilds I've been a part of over the years, none of them want to play with streamers. We all recognise what effect they will very likely have and would rather not experience it. I'd happily bet my last pound on there being a vocal minority of players "literally obsessed" with them.
---
And absolutely, I'd rather be able to play and enjoy games and do a menial job than ruin games for myself by playing them for other people's entertainment. Gaming as a job? No thanks.
---
Gotcha thanks!
---
Cya
---
True, Swedish is the most English scandinavian language. Example: "hungry" in swedish is "hungrig" while Norwegian and Danish is "sulten"
---
Thats where i see the big problem.
---
I don't think blizzard will stand by and watch how neither of the big streamers will be able to play the game in peace. So they will have to ban those people camping streamers, saying camping at this level isn't intended and against the tos yada yada. I mean this is way more likely than blizzard taking actions against a big streamer since he brings views.
---
And that would clearly split the classic community.
---
I feel like  the people that, in the beginning, didn't care about streamers are thinking strongly negative of them now due to their intense sense of entitlement. 
---
For example Asmongold saying "I will pick whatever Server i want and make your experience miserable and there is nothing u can do about it." 
---
Im just sad how all this is playing out.
---
I was really looking forward to classic, but the impact Big streamers will have on the game could really be the thing that kills classic.
---
Just think about who the people were u hunted back in the days - GM's, your rival while leveling, opposing guilds and so on. There were relationships u build along the way. The people that are known in 2019 classic will be neckbeards that act like the game belongs to them.
---
It won't even impact myself since i'm from EU but i feel bad for the people that get a completely Different experience because they play on a streamer realm.
---
Thanks. I was wondering where the hell the class colour option went from the beta stress test.
---
Hot
---
Same as OCE
---
&gt; Realistically at worse you need to relog every now and then
---
Which will have no effect at all.
---
A quick /who will identify their current zone, after that you just need to look for the gaggle of weirdos who follow them around
---
 [https://www.iswowclassicout.com/](https://www.iswowclassicout.com/)Exact countdown to the event added as well
---
I wonder if he ever got that Void Star Talisman he was always going on about...
---
Maybe but while it wasn't around in vanilla pirate servers are off heavily in scripting, mob damage, hit/parry/dodge chance, ect.
---
know of any guilds recruiting on fairbanks?
---
yes, but sapper charges are also for AOEing people down in mass pvp, like Asmongolds fanboys ;)
---
Its pvp server pvp is allowed you can twist it how you want
---
That too. In the same way that streamers and their communities will harass a normal player's game experience, these obsessive counter-streamer will do the same to the streamers' experience.
---
U need to stop callinh every problem layering
---
No LOL
---
Nice
---
I'll say this for the last time: layers aren't servers.
---
Layers are that, layers of the same server.
---
Imagine that 300 people are in the starting quest hub for a race. Layering can create 3 instances of the same server and house 100 player on each, making it easier to level. It doesn't create 3 servers..
---
If there are 5k people online on the server, doesn' matter that there are 5, 10, or more layers, the server will be full and other people won't be able to log in.
---
Just because you cut an apple in half doesn't mean you suddenly have more apples, or fewer.
---
This was posted yesterday
---
There are many situations in life where I already thought "Did *this* really inspire me?" and there is nothing wrong with it. It can be weird. Emotions can be confusing. Just as random stuff can bring you into bad stuff it can bring you into good stuff, too.
---
As much as I want Blizzard to be completely off with the numbers, and see Classic become wildly popular, I hardly think that even a fraction of the playerbase will play it. And retention will likely be much lower, especially if the content grows stale after the last phase.
---
Where did you pull your 600k from? That seems like an excessive number, especially considering current subscriber estimates are around 5 million (which is world-wide, not Europe). I know, a lot of non-subscribers are coming back for Classic, but still. I'd be surprised if we have 60k players after week 1.
---
Just try to be a little positive about it until we can play. There's no point in complaining now when nobody even knows how it will be.
---
You wouldn't assume the majority of players are already currently playing retail wow?
---
Hunter, afaik they could even solo some worldbosses
---
I took a look on the bug list before posting here, but wasn't sure if maybe I'm using the wrong language in describing this bug. I reported it in the stress test via the in game bug reporter though.
---
Did anyone else notice in the stress test that mob agro would reset on the spot, rather than requiring the mob to go back to their usual pathing first? This was **only a problem when swapping agro with a pet** as far as I could test. I only tried with Warlock (backed up by other locks replicating this bug), but assume Hunters could also do this.
---
To replicate:
---
1. Pull agro *purely through proximity to the mob, do not attack in any way* and start running away
---
2. Send pet to hit mob, then return to passive so it continues to run with you and not despawn. 
---
3. When the mob gets to its de-agro distance of chasing your pet, it will then lose agro, but **instantly start a new agro-session on you**. The usual behaviour (as I recall) is to de-agro from the pet and return to it's usual pathing.
---
4. If you again did action #2, **you can infinitely chain agro**
---
I never casted, attacked, or did any action beyond run away (and attack with my pet) during these examples, so there's no way I could have garnered any threat beyond the original proximity agro.
---
Congratulations! This is not stupid at all. Keep up the good work!
---
There is *most likely* a layer and/or player cap. Say, 15 layers with 3k players on each. The more players logging in, the more of those layers will be activated letting people in.
---
If they keep adding more layers to one server it will get to a point where even if 50 - 70% players quit it will still be overcrowded. 
---
So, in theory, Blizz could have just one server with 50-100 layers but imagine what happens when they remove those layers after p1.
---
But then we went back in time to classic and bought a lot of ankhs
---
Im kicking myself now for fighting against sharding. I should have known they would put a worse system in just to spite us. Sharding sounds like a dream at this point.
---
then leave the group crybaby daahhhhhhhhhhh
---
towns were region based, nothing like layering
---
You can search for example "3pm PDT" in google and it's going to tell you that time in your time
---
Couldn't the GMs also ban the people who false-reported?
---
that retard soda has no clue whats coming his way
---
all the big dick pserver pvp guilds have a hard on for streamers
---
will be fun when the rage compilation will be out
---
Same time as launch in 2 weeks... 3 pdt.
---
Not going Golemagg. Just mocking the sub.
---
RemindMe! 3 days
---
Very cool! I'm reading the Warcraft Diary by John Staats (highly recommended if you're interested in the development of Vanilla WoW) where he mentioned that he put those mushrooms there.    
---
It was because he was worried people would get lost in the maze, but in the end he decided it wasn't that great a solution because you can barely see them.
---
There's always going to be big groups of nationalities on realms, especially now with a lower number of realms than retail. Just pick the realm you prefer to be in, it's not like you're going to be able to avoid certain nationalities or other spoken languages in European realms. I don't think I've ever been in a guild with less than 10 nationalities.
---
Bump, blizzard needs to see this.
---
Chances of ranking up to r11+ when theres only 2 pvp servers are slim to none.
---
However, the blue pvp set is attainable and is pretty good!

bunch of soft ass bitches. go play pve
---
Oh I didn’t want to seem as if I am accusing anybody of hating the spanish playerbase. I wrote this comment last night before going to bed and what I actually mean to say is that I am getting tired of the constant complaining about everything this past weekend.
---
Most streamers are going to try to level pretty quickly and have borderline limitless time to play.  I wouldnt be surprised to see them logging out his first day in the upper 20s at least. Which is a lot farther than most will get in one sitting and his fanbase is going to follow him everywhere. 
---
People trying to hardcore level will probably suffer and it sucks for them, but as long as streamers have been online for a few hours more than the rest of us they will probably be a zone or two ahead of majority of the player base.
---
Well apparently the spanish have announced they'll be playing on Shazzrah aswell, so you'll have to get used to alot of spanish spam in trade chats etc
---
ok golemaggg player
---
[solo player game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnMqrW_jFh4)
---
Oh yeah you didn't hear? Blizzard can't be trusted for any bullshit they say in announcements.
---
I saw one about that yoday
---
Have you not been paying attention to the stress test? There was plenty of mass pvp and people/groups/raids unable to join due to layers, which is pretty sad.
---
I agree that it is unlikely to change, but trying to put water on the fire is also IMO not good, I'd rather have some outrage so we can hopefully have Blizzard acknowledge the problem and seek to solve it asap. For me personally this is the biggest issue I have with classic so I really hope for a solution.
---
Sweet, thanks.
---
Alrighty, thankyu very much for the responses!
---
Your answers will be very helpful to me when I'll play on my Priest.
---
Is there any time limit on this? Can I request unplayed days from something like two months ago?
---
Someone made a website, www.avoidstreamers.com, that is being updated as impactful streamers announce their choices.
---
The way I did it as a kid was to stand in front of people’s kill and they’ll try to loot but accidentally auto attack me instead lol.
---
Being new, I want to say go with what your heart tells you. I will give a little bit of advice, though. While leveling, Enchanting will not make you any money apart from selling wands, which can be lucrative, but this means you will have to disenchant gear (turn it into mats) in order to level your enchanting and this gear you will be disenchanting will more often than not be worth more selling to a vendor than disenchanting it. Getting enchanting when you hit level 60 is a lot more lucrative as you can run lower level dungeons solo and obtain a bunch of gear or but out low level gear/mats as a few silver will be worth a lot less to you at level 60 than it will at level 10.
---
Engineering will not make you money. Most of the items are Soulbound which means they can not be traded. It is an absolute amazing profession that will give you so many fun tools and boost your dps but it is expensive and you will have to pour either a lot of time into mining or a lot of money into mats with no real monetary reward.
---
Tailoring is great for leveling a warlock. You will most likely get most of your gear from questing and dungeons, but bags will make you some good money and you still may be able to make yourself the odd item here or there that will be better than what you have. I believe at max level there is a tailoring recipe that will give you a really good robe, but I am not sure if it is as good for warlocks as it is for mages, but it is Soulbound so you have to be a tailor in order to obtain it.
---
Really, if you are new to classic wow, though, I'd say go with what you think is coolest or the most fun. You'll have other ways to make money and every profession has it's perks, even if making money isn't the strongest one.
---
They probably don't care which server has the most people, they're gonna roll wherever the most guilds that wanted to dodge them went. Apes are all about grief and total dominance preferably over people who try to avoid them or people who try to fight back. Only thing you can do is ignore them and hope for the best.
---
Question
---
So I'm not a fan of this guy or anything but it's beyond blatantly obvious that he's being sarcastic here to everyone else, right?
---
If you want your troll shaman to be called Thex, do it instantly.
---
Log on -&gt; choose server -&gt; create char, then you can't get further.
---
Hm, layer switching shouldn't even happen except for when you login tbh. You should be on the same layer from the moment you log on to the moment you log off, imo.
---
But really, layering should just not be used.
---
Even if it could be said of French and Germans players, they get their own servers so it will not be an issue.
---
And no, Spanish people don't try to speak English. That by itself is toxic enough.
---
&gt;We have no servers yet, but you are already flaming us. 
---
Spinebreaker, Agamaggan...
---
Sorted the list Alphabetically  
---
Added two more guilds on the Alliance
---
Respect will cost a fair bit tho
---
This person is giving you advice for someone that is experienced in the game. Yes you can only have two primary professions at a time and yes you can unlearn one and learn another at any time.
---
what do you mean nope? He is right they do attract more people for the game wich is only beneficial
---
I think they should get their names too, if they had them they could have already picked a server and all this shit could be avoided.
---
Remember all those tailoring/enchanting casters ? 
---
They'll ALL need enchanting rods from you. How's 100g /1 Mithril rod sound ? 
---
Copper rod is the only one sold by NPC's and is usable for starter enchants, all the other enchants need \[x metal\] rod to make the runed enchanting version (think there's bronze, iron, steel ..etc).
---
Please make me some rods :)
---
Yeah, non gamers can sometimes underestimate the potential appeal of games, with MMO’s in particular as it gives a satisfying sense of progression and ownership not found in most typical games. I’d even say a lot of actual gamers who haven’t played one don’t realize the appeal of a great MMO. So it’s never surprising for me to see women get into MMO’s that don’t actually play any other game. You don’t have to be a typical gamer to play or enjoy an MMO, it’s a virtual world that you get to inhabit and adventure in after all. The more you play the more satisfying and engaging it becomes. Anyway, I hope you both have a great time with it!
---
As well as the brits. They have also claimed Shazzrah.
---
As a swede, this will be interesting...
---
Blizzard's stance on PvP has always been 'If its a PvP problem, there's a PvP Solution'.
---
Does depend on the guild and the content. Most guilds, for MC, sure. Hardcore one in aq40 or naxx, prob not

---
&gt; Or Blizzard could do server merged later on by throwing 5 "dead" servers together. Or any other solution. Blizzard wants to go with layering.
---
And Blizzard is clearly making the wrong choice here. Server merges would be completely fine. You start on one of many servers, areas aren't ridiculously full, you have the "seeing the same people all the time while leveling" experience, you fill up your friend list with people you met in the world while playing.
---
Next month your server ends up a bit dead so it gets merged with others. You and your original small community now have to integrate with a few other small communities, but that's not nearly as bad as some retail-like phasing shitfest
---
Yeah same here. Both big Swedish calssic communtiys as well as all guilds i have seen ha´ve claimed shazzrah.
---
Awesome man. I have been looking for a bigger a minimap and fixing the double xp bars!
---
warlock is great, shaman and paladin don't lack much either as they end up using lots of autoattacks with weapon enhancements/seals + some instants while conserving mana anyway.
---
Lol less than half of $12 really puts a strain on the capital
---
yea because anything other "me and my wife are coming back to wow what class should i play" doesn't belong on this sub
---
RemindMe! 6pm August 28 "world channels"
---
In general I thought the idea of layering is a decent one, but with the current execution it literally seems like they copy pasted the sharding code and renamed it with a few minor tweaks. If it worked how they proposed it should work I'd be okay with it for maybe 2-3 weeks, but things like what is happening in this clip is completely unacceptable and will heavily contribute to ruining the whole leveling exppeprience, which unlike retail wow would be a good one.
---

Isn't targeted harassment a ToS violation? stalking them onto a server to focus solely on ruining their enjoyment.

For the record i have no problem with ganking or people targeting streamers, just pointing out that potential angle.

---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
Thank you for your advice, you've been really helpful.
---
Well, blizzz obviously is banking on that the servers they have setup is enough for the most HC people. And then they will add more servers based on the demand at launch.
---
If new players come in, they can LOCK the servers that new accounts cannot create chars into those servers.
---
I think sharding covers small areas, the world is basically stiched together using multiple shards. Layering is much bigger in scale, a single layer can cover an entire continent so the chances of running into the same people 10 minutes later is much higher.
---
Please make an actual petition! and post it on the wow classic forums as well
---
Any people that have played the stress test should know why this post is just cherrypicking and lies.  
---
As I created my first character during the test, at the very beggining of it, there was like 150-200 people at the starting zone. I rolled an UD so Tirisfal was full of people and that lasted for hours.  
---
About the images this guy has posted from Nostalrius, obviously cherrypicking since are images taken from the day the server was closing.  
---
Amazing this has 2 platinums.  You like to eat anything you see.
---
http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/
---
Check with these.
---
for leveling solo? I'd choose alchemy, you get the extra buffs and healing potions which make survival on your own much easier, as you play you'll find the healing pots alone net you a fair bit of funds just selling them off to rando's that are in the same area as you go.
---
I'd never go for enchanting until you have a high level char to farm gear to disenchant, in vanilla especially, it is super expensive to get up, but conversely the biggest money spinner if you can get to the top earliest on your server.
---
The most important thing to know for healing is that your job is not to keep everyone's bar full all of the time but to make sure that nobody who is important dies.
---
For PvE you usually only need one or two heals at all.
---
Your biggest heal and a lower rank of it that heals about half of your biggest heal.
---
You don't start healing unless you think otherwise someone might die or panick. Then you heal as much at once as you can while making sure not to overheal.
---
Then you wait again because you want as long as possible streaks of not spending mana because that is how you regenerate mana in combat.
---
The mistake would be to constantly cast something over and over. Flashheal, Renew and Powerword:Shield are for PvP. They are too mana-hungry for what they do. Avoid them! Also don't cast your shadow-stuff while healing. Interrupting your mana-regen is not woth the damage.
---
But what you can do is shooting your wand at low-health enemies. It costs no mana and thus doesn't interrupt your regeneration. If you are lucky you get a kill and procc your Spirit Tap.
---
If you do what I said you won't have much issues healing as a shaodw-priest.
---
Just knowing about the mantra of "Spending mana in bursts and then take breaks" will already make you a better healer than 50% of others who do it. It is super annoyning as a tank to constantly have shield and renew on you and then have to wait for the healer to chug water every pull and go oom during boss-fights.
---
There’s a clip of it floating around. They are the only ones that I can see jebaiting their community since they really are going for world first.
---
Makes me wonder, who will play on Golemagg? EU streamers? Spaniards? Hopefully...
---
Depending on your class you can definitely use your leveling builds for healing and tanking all the way up to 60. It is worth, for example if your leveling an enhancement shaman, to keep some healing gear in your bags that you can switch to. Personally I'll be playing a druid and will tank or heal depending on what's needed (all the way to 60 as feral) by doing this.
---
Any chance of adding the Off-Meta Discord? The goal is not only to foster a healthy atmosphere for players to discuss what they enjoy but also inform and prepare players for their next battle: https://discord.gg/4QWqKFV
---
You sound like you have nothing personal against spanish community.
---
Thanks, but im spanish and not toxic. I dont know where are you from, but you are toxic as fuck.
---
See? There is toxic players in all communities.
---
Keep you hate.
---
I wonder if the S stands for Spanish or Scandinavian.
---
There is no viable alternative. If they made too many servers and had to merge later, people would be far more furious than the people freaking out about a slightly less populated stormwind/org on a stress-test. 
---
The funny part is, layering is basically that, making more realms that will eventually being merged, except you don't have the downsides like people having to change their name, they don't have to move to a realm with established guilds, they don't get shoved into a completely different economy, they don't have to organize a guild transfer (and possibly change the name of their guild, muh community, btw). 
---
Layering is all of the benefits of starting with more realms and merging down later with none of the downsides. 
---
Either way, blizzard was screwed, and discussions like these are just proof that people have been looking for a reason to hate on blizzard all along. 
---
If this is a dealbreaker for these people, if they are willing to throw away the entire experience over the minuscule chance they may experience layering weirdness for a week or two, they were going to wash out by level 30 regardless.
---

__Apply here:__
---
Looking forward to getting to know you.
---
I'm also worried about server communities; If your layer keeps changing, even if only for the first month, you are going to keep seeing different people and there won't be a real server community, just like retail.
---
So is there a definite server that streamers or most streamers are going to or at least a high chance of where they’ll end up?
---
Anyone got a good addon for buffbars and castbars?
---
I don't like how Luna forces the cast bar to stick to the portrait, and I prefer the buffs layed out with the name visible. WeakAuras doesn't have anything so far (as I can see), and I don't know if there's a way to make it myself without manually adding every single buff/debuff in a rule.
---
Basically, a quartz alternative
---
it has been said multiple times, just have a couple realms share the same name database and merge them if necessary.
---
Hi, /u/deathscrims
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpa3sj/i_hope_they_never_implement_wow_tokens_into/). 
---
You should not be playing classic
---
Thank you, I will be playing with afew people i know, so not always alone haha.
---
This brings tears to my eyes ; )
---
I believe they have said they are going east coast PvP and have excluded Thalnos as a possible server choice for them. Thalnos will also be the unofficial Brazilian server, though, so take that into consideration.
---
You would think that, but a bunch of the mega communities got together and decided that Pagle will be their server too . . . horde side.
---
Yeah that’s true but also the threshold has been lowered significantly and they’ve obviously been testing things on top of this. I get that people are unhappy with the system in general but the over reacting and dishonest shit is what my point is about. Make noise and complain but base it on logic and don’t flip out at the first sign it isn’t 100% perfect
---
Resto druid. It's pretty good for PVE content as healer, but crap as dmg, with a decent hybrid spec you can heal all the dungeon content, AND kick total ass PvP but you'll never be good enough for the raids that way.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic - It can do a bunch of stuff including the gryphon removal ^^
---
They already stated that layering would be only for launch phase and mostly in starting areas no ?
---
If they know english, looking at you spain, italy, greece.
---
Stress test census revealed that hunters were #1 (EU PvE, Ally side). I think there will be quite some more than the official census results. 
---
As well as the # of players going for PvE servers compared to PvP servers.
---
As Veganboi97 said, Necrosis, it's an addon that helps warlock things :D
---
I don't envy their job I'm just not so deluded that I think I'd rather scrub others' toilets. 
---
Being a paid photographer is pretty fun, rewarding and pays well. I don't view it as any other job but okay thanks for your personal projections about me dahhhhhhhhh
---
Yeah.. you’re the target..
---
Or rp-pvp of you don't mind doing a little rp :)
---
Adding to that I think he said that he already did tank as bear in og vanilla and people were against it ofc just like they are now.
---
Can someone fill me in on the APES hate? I understand that most people dislike them but I haven't understood why.
---
There is a reason why cards were still buy able at stores during WoD times, heck I bet some stores still sell them.
---
Yea I’m pretty sure they are
---
That was what the community wanted, never anything Blizzard said. Anyways its not possible with layering, that's phasing.
---
That's not harassment, it's fucking vanilla world pvp. I've camped the fuck out of people and their alts before who I have had disagreements with in game. It's part of the fun of pvp servers.
---
If the possibility of this behaviour doesn't sit well with you, play on a pve server.
---
How can it possibly surprising that people just pick a race for other things that optimisation?
---
Like, even if it does not matter for you in the slightest, just realize that most people don't want to play with a character they don't like to look at for hundreds/ thousands of hours.
---
Don't have a link rn, but it's just called No Gryphons.
---
I don't think layering can stay full time. Imagine pulling "two" Kazzaks to Stormwind due to encountering him in two different layers. I don't think they'd allow that kind of thing. It's a short term thing to manage populations and people shouldn't get excited and worry.
---
Or, you know, he will be lvl 60 after 2 weeks, most of his viewers need like 2-3 months. When they are 60, there won't be layering anymore and they won't need to spam to get on his layer. 
---
After that, they could spam /s in stormwind or sth like that when he stands in sw and watches videos, but that's it.
---
Maybe they will pull some mobs into stormwind, but that's more of a “fun“ event, rather than bothersome. 
---
You guys are exaggerating his influence on the whole server. 
---
Bunch of crybabies. Also imagine shittalking and insulting him since the start of beta and then get mad about him not wanting to do the community a favor and say what server he is rolling on. This community is entitled af, the same thing they criticite asmon for all the time
---
Whatever its fucking called this really is not okay. There shouldn't be ANY kind of layering/sharding/phasing at all. Fuck.
---
Unless a streamer decides they want to fuck it up with absolutely no responsibility just because they feel like it.
---
If you already locked then you can not get into another raid dungeon that created by other RL.
---
Well this is logical, they are a pvp guild if Shazzrah is the biggest server, it will have a better honorsystem. So why wouldent they want to pick the best server to pvp on ?
---
Druid is a hybrid class. Which means you're gonna need everything you have at your disposal to win a fight in an open world. 
---
The thing with druids is, you can pick your fights, since you can stealth. And you can run away from the fight if you want.
---
I found druid fights to take longer 1v1 than some other classes. But they're really fun to play.
---
You can put up a decent fight, and you're gonna win most of the battles. You just have to put a lot of work and skill into it. Once you do, you're gonna have nice time in wpvp.
---
Your ":D" in the end indicates that you have not actually faced them before. If you would have you would also be avoiding them as horde.
---
it does work. Has a couple errors but that's about it.  If you turn off lua errors you won't see them. I'd say the only things I've really noticed having a problem is the tooltip isn't styled like ElvUI but all its features work, and the XP bar is a bit iffy, but thats it.
---
Oh really? How stupid of us to be so paranoid. I mean, it's not like Blizzard has been fucking over anything else lately.
---
Buddy, the hell.   
---
Blizzard is making big mistakes everywhere and not listening to their community (look at retail).  
---
Now they are making classic, great, really.  
---
But they also promised layering wouldn't be like sharding/phasing. Well, it is. It looks exactly like it. Whenever I enter a city or sometimes at random times I see people walk and appear out of thin air right next to me.
---
I suspect that during a stress test one would lower the threshold for spawning layers, so that you could like, you know, stress test the tech.    
---
But what do I know.
---
So you estimate that there will be as many players on the PvE/RP servers as on the PvP servers?
---
I estimate, that you will be wrong.
---
Name regulations used to be standard for rp servers. But then again... the standard once was that you didn’t pay for betas, and oh boi has that apparently changed - ppl cuss me out for saying them charging for not just one but two betas is bs
---
*if*
---
Every lockout works the same as a Mythic lockout, you're locked to the ID for the duration of the lockout and if that group continues without you the instance will be cleared. 
---
The smaller raids (Onyxia, ZG, AQ20) have less than a week lockouts so there's less risk involved, but the lockout mechanism is still the same.
---
HNNNNNRGGG
---
Alright thanks for the reassurance man, so hyped to main nelf Druid.
---
at the end of the day hes making thousands of dollas every hour while u are wasting ur freetime trying to attack him and runnin back to your corpse after getting killed by his followers lmao
---
start reserving their names. they aren't intitled to them, a name is a name is a name.
---
I love these memes, doing prosopopoeia about servers.
---
 I will give my loyalty to the United Kingom and respect its rights and freedoms - aswell as chancellor Merkel
---
Well all they need to do is get around lvl 13~ for horde and about 16~ for alliance, then they can just spam dungeons until 60. 
---
Since dungeon lvling is confirmed to be one of the fastest ways to lvl, they'll probably end up doing this. Will also never have to compete for mobs, as an extra bonus.
---
**&lt;Crooks and Liars&gt;** **EU Alliance PvP**
---
** Golemagg**
---
We're a group of AQ40/Naxx experienced players who used to play on various top guilds of Vashj EU server, and as of right now we are numbering at around 30 core raid players with room for a few more core raiders.
---
While it may sound a bit terrifying to join a group of people who know each other, in truth many of us have been scattered around the different realms over the years and are now coming back together to finish what we've started back in the days along with enjoying the nostalgia. 
---
* **Guild Rule 1**: No racism, sexism or bigotry. 
---
* **Guild Rule 2**: Be nice to your guildies. We're all in this to have a good time.
---
* **Raids**: In a raid you're spending 39 other people's time, so respect them and spend that time well.
---
* **PvE goal?** Hardcore enough to clear all the content, but no more hardcore than that. That's actually quite hardcore by AQ40, and means less room for bad play as time goes on. You can play as any class/spec you want, so long as we clear the content effectively. From roughly twin emps onwards the PvE content starts to put constraints on how casual people can be regarding to playtime and specs.
---
* **PvP goal?** Depends on how hard people want to rank when phase 2 comes around, and how the premade scene shakes out. Main focus as a guild is towards PvE progression though.
---
* **Loot**: Loot council, with a google doc that lays out priorities. 
---
&gt; Example: Ring of Spell Power; prio1 caster DPS, prio2 offspec.
---
* **World buffs and consumables**: We collectively get the Ony head (and ZG heart when it's out) buff and head to raid. Getting the DM buffs before a raid or logging out to save buffs is not required of people. Consumables are a requirement, but you don't need to have flasks up for farm content. Don't show up to rag without fire pots though!
---
* **Schedule**: Sunday, Monday and Wednesday as of now. Raid times are 19:00-23:00 CEST.
---
*There will never be MC/BWL/AQ40/Naxx raids on fridays or saturdays.*
---
**Right now in need of 1 hunter, and a few mages, anything else is up for discussion**
---
Feel free to PM me or add me on discord jonu#4691 for a talk.
---
This is wild, I'm kind of doing the same thing, and it seems like so many others here are too. I think what might be happening is we're all reverting to a childlike excitement state over this game so the need for such vices kind of just vanishes. Drugs, booze, excessive eating are all things to cope with adulthood, but its gonna be like we aren't adults anymore which is fucking phenomenal.
---

---
It's really not. If you are dumb enough to broadcast where you are on a PvP server it is not harrassment if someone comes and gibs you. 
---
PvP, corpse camping etc. Is not harrassment.
---
Fuck that noise. These discords always have power tripping admins/mods and always start a whole shit load of drama.
---
And that’s a perfectly good point to bring up and discuss. Only the devs know for sure but this could also be things they’re testing with? Either way that’s discussion that can be had without going crazy.
---
I know I won't if I keep seeing this for weeks
---
Last I knew there were competing discords not any official discords. Let's not sticky something like that yet.
---
Yeah becasue "its just beta wait for release" worked super well for BFA. Everyone is enjoying that game right now.
---
imagine being a hunter and having your pet get buffed aswell. really sucks when those two hours are over though.
---
Remember that all these projections only reach people who stalk forums/reddit. PLENTY of players wont know about any of this and will just pick randomly:)
---
If its true then its fine i but think thats still a lot of time to abuse it. Anyone could literally layercamp the shit out of herb/minerals/rares.If its not fixed to have Like half day CD to be able to switch Layer again
---
Yea u gonna want guides tho
---
well playing with a warrior and a hunter, a bear wont be useful. However you healing and staying away from the fight, kiting, will make those 2 a killing machine.
---
The thing is ganking isn't.  But there have been incidents in the past where continually camping someone for hours would result in the GM banning someone for harassment.
---
But as a streamer they are sort of asking for it as they are announcing to everyone their location.
---
Say's the guy that literally can't take a joke. 
---
Since you're clearly so butt hurt ill explain it for you, France has won the most wars out of every country to date, key word being WON not lost, with one of the lowest surrender rates, The whole surrender thing is just a meme.
---
You can either fight or run away so it's a win either way. Druids are especially dangerous because if they get away you can stalk then in stealth and guarantee your revenge.
---
Aw man I don’t wanna hell haha :(
---
I played a druid back then times were hard lol
---
druids are excellent world pvpers
---
BFA is not terrible by any stretch of the imagination. Does it have its flaws? Definitely. Does the general community shit on blizz regardless? Definitely.
---
I expect to be flamed, bring it on.
---
Surely thats relative depending of what youre talking about?
---
If im telling you i have a few dollars on me is that always $3 according to you? lmao
---
Goodbye. I will be playing Classic in the mean time and having a blast.
---
gives them a slightly better chance of getting their name
---
Good!
---
You've put it into much better words than I would have been able :)
---
Arent stremers going PVE so they wont get "griefed".
---
Well, on the RPPvP realm we want to see roleplay or at least a deep respect for it, and it will mean being flagged for PvP for daring into the level 20+ zones.
---
I welcome you to the Grob Mob if you choose Grobbulus given those two things are ok with you
---
Dunno why one would complain about Scandinavians ... but apparently Spaniards have a bad rep of not communicating, overtake general/trade with Spanish and being toxic when they do finally communicate. Not all Spaniards ofc. personally I’m not too worried. Scandinavians are general great at English, brits are gonna join as well, think there are Dutch as well, who are also great at Englando ... plus I’ve heard that the inquisitors had a hard time agreeing on a server so they’ve split .. not sure though just a rumor ... if so, it will just be a minor community. Nothing to worry about really.
---
Yeah what ive heard the spaniards are claiming it.
---
And? Nobody cares, everyone is equal and should be treated equally when they pay the same price for the same product. They are not blizzard employees so why do you think it’s ok to privilege them in any way? Not blizzards ‘fault’ they do free advertisement. If they want to, sure, they can do and they will.
---
Hahaha me and my mates call it the side exit swig
---
But the peeps that won't play anymore are just obnoxious #nochangers anyway, so you won't really miss them.
---
Is this a NA problem? I played on EU stress test and EVERYWHERE was crowded as fuck.
---
This point can also be reversed by saying "why not roll on a RP-realm and just permanently flag yourself for PvP. You will experience the world as 'dangerous' as anyone can attack you. If this way of playing is appealing to such a big group than you are bound to find people from the opposite faction who will do the same and there you will find your RP-PvP action you desire with the option to opt-out whenever the PvP becomes too disruptive to your event.
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand the points you raise in your original post, and I agree with most of it with the main point being that GMs should step up in RP and RP-PvP realms where there is excessive behaviour like corpse camping or obvious trolling. However I have the feeling that if you are looking for RP with some PvP, you are better off on an RP server, as opposed to an RP-PvP where you will find PvP with some RP.
---
Auf einem PvE server ist meist ein Allianz überhang - Ich schätze mal sowas in die Richtung wie  58 : 42
---
That's the most dumb post I've seen on this subreddit, and that's saying a lot.
---
What you're trying to answer is.. How long is a rope?
---
If a streamer is getting ganked, pretty sure it would make a more fun experience if he rallied his army to pvp against this guild than mass reporting. It is a really old pvp problem with a really known pvp solution.
---
The better times were /emote you have been reported afk.  To unmark yourself please type /afk.  Watch as the on average 3-7 people left the BG.
---
And god was making portals to Darnassus at the start of AV fun as well.  Once saw 15 people click on it right next to a healthstone.  Twas great freakin times.
---
That's not what I was saying, lol.
---
The sheer amount of layers we’ll need with the current server count will also heavily limit the amount of spontaneous friendships that normally happen out In the world due to running into each other a number of times.
---
This guy is the shit btw. Not even exaggerating.
---
They are delusional if they think they will be able to do that.
---
Sorta works. The worst bug I ran into is that you can't access your bank.
---
And it’s the only reason they need. Cause what are you going to do not play?
---

---
Which addons are you going with?
---
prejudices like this often come from former experiences. it is what it is.
---
&gt; the servers ran ok
---
Mate we crashed a server by raiding Ironforge with ~200 people.
---
Spaniards have bad rep, also, they had their own realms after a while because people where actually quitting wow because of them.
---
I mean I agree completely except for the last point, private servers are a thing and those people will just go back to them. 
---
Most people who want classic already play WoW in some way (bfa, private) if layering bugs them enough they will just go back. And with classic we will have real numbers for private servers to emulate.
---
Meh idk really, like I said I think it's being handled the only way they can. They can't see the future and were pretty against it in the first place.
---
Sorry asmongold and any other streamer hasn't had action taken against them for what their fans do especially when they say stuff on stream and not in game.
---
If you're new to this then you'd probably want to go for Skinning &amp; Tailoring when levelling. Sell the leather as you go to make sure you have the gold for a mount at level 40 and Tailor along the way. At level 60 I'd advise getting rid of Leatherworking and maybe do Engineering or Enchanting :)
---
Blizz definitely did not document every single change in the patch notes.
---
Sorry when? I never once lagged on Nost unless the server was having its quick reset. I think it could more be an issue with your internet maybe?
---
Will be playing on Shazz myself with 7-8 irl friends and we are all from Norway. Having more Scandinavians will just be amazing as long as the trade chat etc. Stays in English.
---
Spaniards will be playing in Shazzrah as well #YOLO
---
Private servers at their peak had 15k players, max. That is a veritable drop in the bucket compared to interest for an official classic realm.
---
#**&lt;Rising&gt;**
---
We're **&lt;Rising&gt;!** A new semi-hardcore raiding guild playing Horde on Shazzrah (EU-PVP server).
---
**Introduction**
---
We have all been waiting a long time for Classic WoW and we are looking to build our roster of players now so that we can really hit the ground running.
---
The main focus of our guild will be to build a community of friendly players that are keen to help each other and get the most enjoyment out of Classic. We believe that having a group of supportive players will be a huge benefit in Classic as there is such a focus on cooperative play. Although we do not have an age requirement as such, we are an adult guild. The majority of our guild are 25/30+ so should you wish to apply take that into consideration.
---
When you are levelling, we want a community to be there to help you with that quest or to kill that Alliance dog who has been corpse camping you. At endgame, we want to gear up together and have fun doing so.
---
**Raiding**
---
We plan to start endgame content as soon as we can. We intend to host raids on Monday, Thursday and Sunday 20:30 - 23:30 CET for progression raids, although we do not expect we will need all 3 days to clear the current content (particularly at the start).
---
If you do sign up, we expect you to be on time and prepared. That said, by no stretch of the imagination are we a hardcore raiding guild that’s pushing for world firsts or expecting players to sink every minute of their time into Classic. We're all a bit older now with life stuff going on. Our goal is to clear the content before the next patch roles out but also enjoy it, so know your class and bring your best.
---
Although the guild is fairly young, we are starting to get a solid core raiding team together. At the moment our class preferences can be seen on our website. However, if you see your class listed as low priority or even closed, we are always open for exceptional candidates so feel free to still apply.
---
For loot we're adopting a fair and transparent Loot Council system for raiding with a management team that’s been running raiding guilds for nearly 15 years.
---
We also have future plans for alt raids, however this will be much further down the line.
---
**Other guild activities**
---
Whilst our main focus will be on raiding we also plan to host some PvP events. Personally, a lot of our current guild members and I love Classic's PvP content! We are hoping to do some World PvP, Battlegrounds and to raid capital cities.
---
There has also been an expressed interest for twinks by current members. So I imagine we will have a community on this as well.
---
**Member expectations**
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, willing to help their fellow guildies and be able to have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we have separate expectations such as turning up on time and so on.
---
If you feel like this could be the guild for you then please visit our website https://rising.shivtr.red/. You will need let us know a little about yourself to ensure that we share the same values.
---
Additionally, if you have any questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact us directly on discord @[Rising] Boo#0059, @GlenCoco#3702, @mizi#3868 or @QFierced#7447.
---
**Lok'tar Ogar!**
---
I didn't
---
Is this true or are you just talking?
---
I might do that on my alt, but it might take awhile to get it to 60.
---
Usually I'd expect top to be a fury warrior, then some rogues/mages/(warlocks), then more fury warriors.
---
Just wait. The reddit user is not the normal user. I'd expect to be more rogues and hunters than these polls say but I could be wrong. Just beware that the reddit user is like 1% of the english speakers countries.
---
No, maybe in naxx gear they will be competitive with pure dps classes. We had a warrior with thunderfury dps sometimes in heavy cleave fights (neffarion intro) and he would do okay then, but for 99% of vanilla rogues mages hunters will top charts.

**&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.

Garrote doesn't silence in Classic.
---
Im sure there is some sort of limit. Back when I went through this it was sometime in october during the legion xpack that I stopped playing but had paid for a sub. I sent the request about mid january a handful of months later so a period of ~3 months or so. 
---
It never hurts to ask support imho. You paid for something and didnt make use of it and so youre simply asking you get what you paid for credited to you. I figure the outcome is heavily biased towards who in support you deal with.
---
Yeah, but abusing layers for farming in Phase 1 will destabilize the market for a long, long time.
---
I kept my post about how horrible layering would be and got downvoted to all hell.  Bet those people feel stupid, right?

I just do it manually, the Twitch Crap never worked for me.

\*\*&lt;Moderna Misstag&gt; \[EU-PVP\] Swedish Semi-Hardcore Raiding \[HORDE\]\*\*
---
\&amp;nbsp;
---
\*\*About Us\*\*
---
We are a group of friends that have been playing WoW since Vanilla Beta and day 1 on the EU launch back in 2005 and now we turn all of our attention towards WoW Classic and we want you to join us!
---
We want to establish a Swedish speaking guild that will be highly respected on our server and have a great community who realise that real life responsibilities comes first and gaming comes second but who still want to have a great time playing WoW Classic. We offer a mature and relaxed raiding environment where everyone feels welcome.
---
First and foremost we want to enjoy our time spent playing the game and if we ensure that we and all of our raiders have a great time playing together then raid progression will follow. Besides having fun the goal will always be to clear all raid content at a steady and reliable pace.
---
\*\*Raid Times\*\*
---
Wed/Sun: 19:30-22:30 CET
---
We plan on raiding twice a week for the initial phases and then likely add a third raid day as we progress into the later phases and additional raids are added.
---
\*\*Loot System\*\*
---
A DKP system will be used, exactly what version of decay/closed/open bid etc is not determined yet. Certain items will be separate from the DKP system, such as gearing up tanks but everything will be done with transparency and fairness in mind.
---
\*\*Expectations\*\*
---
Attitude, Attendance, Performance
---
To us player attitude and behaviour is the most important aspect of being a good guild member, both in dealing with other guild members but also with the rest of the servers community. Poor behaviour on your part will not only tarnish your own reputation but also the guilds reputation and we will not tolerate that. That being said as long as you treat people with a nice and respectable attitude we will not have a problem.
---
Besides having a good attitude we want you to have as good of a raid attendance as you can manage, but it is our job as a community to provide you with an enjoyable experience so that you want to log in and attend raids and perform to the best of your ability. It does not matter if you have previous raiding experience or if you are completely new to the game as long as you are a team player with the mindset that the guild itself will always be more important than any individual member.

I dont think you know what a normie is
---
Just so every one knows. My guild has been making fun of this post. During the stress test we are testing add-ons, checking quests and professions. Almost no one had time to just sit in Org doing nothing. Most of us wanted to be in Org doing nothing,but we will wait the 2 weeks more.
---
Probably longer unless they split realms up.
---
Can confirm, both me and my gf at the time got very into SV. Me more than her though, I must’ve put at least 35 hours into it the first weekend.
---
Golemagg it is
---
I put 1 Day, 3 hours, and 41 minutes onto my Tauren Druid and I also got an orc warrior to 14. I played all weekend because I wanted to test as much as possible. I haven’t had a chance to play any of the betas or other stresses so this was my first time seeing the 1.13.2 client.
---
I’ve been a mod on the “classic wow Eu” discord server a while. Didn’t see all the drama that happened on Golemagg, but I know the admin on the general Eu one is a good fella, and I believe he mentioned having taken it over temporarily to fix things.
---
As most said they will speak English, but don't forget that Shazz will not just be Scandis and Spainards. There's 2 PvP servers, both servers are gonna be a big mix of nationalities. Hopefully both keeping general and world chat in English.
---
The thing layering really takes away is the community.  When you first log in you see someone group up and do a few quests together to get through it faster.  Next zone you see them again strike up a conversation and you made a friend that could last the rest of your life.
---
Layering/sharding what ever people call it takes away that possibility.  It's quite disgusting to me that Blizz actually thinks renaming sharding to "layering" will be okay.

I'm Spanish, so you don't have to tell me how Spanish players are.

It would ban the streamer and his followers for abuse reporting
---
Yeah you dont know
---
Oh well then shit. Useless
---
There’s plenty of ways to do it, they just all suck for the players. But so does every complaint we see about layering on here every day and it is still here. They just don’t give a fuck.
---
Dedicated fans will leave, tourists will stay and then demand a cash shop option for the game and then achievements will be put in.  It will be sickening.
---
How many servers are there going to be? 6...7? How many people are going to stream classic wow? 3-4?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
I just leveled a undead priest to 10 during the stress test and chose to read the quests. I really enjoyed the lore and their storyline. 
---
It was also so cool to read about how the Lich King was still alive and well haha.

Imagine a streamer guild trying to get to BRM raids though.
---
For me they are a necessity at least for the first few days. I've made a few pserver launches (last one was k3) and you spent literally hours to hope to tag the mob respawn for the first at least 2-3 days. 
---
This is what they want to avoid in the first place.
---
For the PvP servers on Europe. There is 2 English PvP (+1 RP PvP), 1 French and 1 German.
---
Keep in mind that they can also decide to increase the layering cap.
---
Do you know the names of the Unitframes, Action bars, chat and Enemy name plates? Cause they are just called "action bars" and so on in the folder.
---
Needs to be an interface menu option
---
You’re a hero
---
I think in vanilla the ownership of a channel was handed to the char with the oldest char (aka created the longest time ago) or the lowest char ID or something and not to the char the longest in channel.
---
When P2 they are just gonna claim the exact same thing, “they were just thinking about removing it after P1”, nd then keep it in. It needs to die and now.
---
Found the normie
---
yeah this is just too obvious, I don't see how people can fall for the golemagg bait so easily
---
Or because you did it for free and he wants to earn money from it. I think you should tip the mage a bit. Whenever I went to farm Maraudon I would get a few stacks from a mage and pay him a few gold for it. 
---
Warlock summons should definitely carry a fee because you actually have to get off your arse and out in the world to get them. But I think people know that because I've never not have someone tip me quite generously for a summon.

Finding out that you are in a HIGH population server is a good thing. Queues arent really a problem for most people (teamviewer, put your PC into que from work/school). You want to have the most packed server out there. Least amount of possibility that it will the one dying out.

Doesn't streamsniping a streamer and camping him fall under this as well? What a lot of people here in this sub want to do to the streamer? Even more so than telling your friends to not play with certain people, because they are assholes, imo.

So in other words, if a streamer or a follower is personally harassed by a hater, he should report the guy

World defense requires rank 11 as far as I know and not 10 :)

They had it lowered to really low amounts to test it this weekends. just FYI

yeah this never happens tbh

Better delete all the non-relevant layering posts that discuss something that dramatically impacts the health and future of the game to make room for this meaningful content

Cool wall bro

&gt;in starting zones. However, I disagree with how it’s used in cities and higher level areas. It ruins the Vanilla feel and like some have said, leveling is a big part of the game and an important one in meeting guilds and making friends. Layering may impact this negatively. Yes, they’ll remove it in phase 2 but when Is th
---
From a performance perspective we have 15 years of hardware improvements and cloud servers. Resources autoscales up and down, depending of the resource requirements. It is much cheaper than having multiple licensed servers.
---
I can't think of a reason why they want to use layering, except if they own an old server farm that they want to re-use.

---
That doesn‘t sound stupid. That sounds awesome! Good for you! 👏
---
Kind of feels in a way that they dont understand to just keep people on a realm on the same damn realm.
---
Or a more sinister thought is that they're doing it in hopes that more casual players just assume not alot of people are playing Classic and will migrate to retail in hopes of being like "I told you so", but then you remember the team seems very invested in Classic and its success and you return to square one wonder why the flip they are so adamant on splitting people up instead of just letting people be on the same damn realm.
---
At this point Emerald Dream "x" would have made more sense and merged by the end of the month (name taken on Emerald Dream 1? then its also taken on ED 2, for a smooth merge) of launch. Right now layering is exploitable with double nodes, cross realm whispers and with people even being layered while in a party. 
---
I hope they fix this as surely a multi billion dollar company has thought of that solution and had good reason for it to not make sense, but its the same company who introduced sharding instead of merging realms so...

Everyone should blacklist soddapoppin on that server

for eastern plaguelands.  none of these are to be opened by a low lvl, too many mobs around
---
Levelling speed. For the 1-40 grind you should be really making sure that anything you loot is sold and you skin everything that you possibly can. At level 40, providing you have the money, getting your mount (+60% Speed) is a significant levelling speed boost. In Classic you're going to be spending a lot of time running around at a much slower pace than retail, thus, getting your riding training out the way early is a huge advantage to levelling speed (and anything else you wanna do, really. It's a horse lol :D). The base cost for level 40 riding is around 90%, providing you have the reputation discount, then at level 60 for the 100% Riding it's 900g including reputation discount. It's gonna be a long, long grind my man.
---
Bonus tip whilst I'm here; I would suggest rebinding auto-run to the middle mouse button click. It's gonna save you some hassle in the long-term

I do not, but there's so much shit on youtube you might find something

Would you like to address the point made or just arbitrarily spout nonsense?

Did you take those numbers out of your ass?

I think the PVP server will be quite full, so I have no worries. PVE one is a different story.
---
Thankfully we have layering this time to reduce this issue :)
---
Will that husband and wife combo run a guild, maybe? Because those are the fucking *best* guilds.
---
Most streamers basically get by on George Costanza syndrome. It's a mixture of slumming it and schadenfreude.

They're almost all unskilled, uneducated, unintelligent, and unattractive losers. They're essentially clowns that people can laugh at to feel better about their own inadequacies.

AQ war effort on a server with 250 000 player population.

Wonder how that will go. You won't know the guild that's in charge of opening it. You won't know the septer bearer.
---
Go rp-pvp
---
This Screenshot is absolutely not relevant to the subject. Starter areas are packed with people, at the start of the stress test it was a pure nostalgic classic nightmare.
---
There are other problems with layering. But standing in an empty city, is non of it. Ironforge will be crowded once the people reach max level and start using the auction house and stuff, not before.
---
This is exactly why Blizzard, if they are smart, will not GAF about pandering to the whiniest pirate server extremists. No matter what Blizzard does they will find some excuse to go back to their pirate servers and tell each other that it is All Blizzard's Fault.
---
The real target audience are returning old school players.
---
Why is thalnos off the table
---
Why do you think the servers will hold 10K players when vanilla servers had 50K players?
---
So, the initial period blows, the server gets a small respite when he outlevels the bulk of the population, and then it goes back to dogshit when everyone catches up at 60 again.

Wasn´t the lfg channel worldwide in 1.12?

You don't even know what you're talking about.

Am I wrong? He showed a video of him team killing and got Esfand to call for someone at pubg to unban him..

Some of us are experiencing vanilla World of Warcraft for the first time and want to see what the raiding scene was like back in 2004, without [Dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04) hounding us for moar dots. We're not looking to be server first, but we are here to make progress (and gaming buddies!).&amp;nbsp;

If this type of raiding experience sounds like something you might be interested in, we have some more information below, as well as a link to our [application](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd). Thanks!&amp;nbsp;

#📅 Guild Events 📅
---
**Pre-Launch:** For those of you that are looking to make friends before launch, be sure to stop by the Discord and say hello! We have daily questions leading up to launch and to be honest, we're all just nerding out in here. Come be excited with us!&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Launch:** On launch day, be sure to show up and enjoy the launch with everyone! Make groups for leveling (or don't, your call), introduce yourself if you haven't already, and have fun! We'll be attempting to create the guild within a few hours after launch.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Post Launch:** Immediately after the game launches, we're all just trying to have fun and hit level 60 together. The plans for raiding are laid out down below. More specific information will be available closer to our first raid night.
---
#⚔️ [Raiding](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse/games/WowClassic/docs/1569043501) ⚔️
---
**Raid nights are every Tuesday and Thursday, 9:00pm - 12:00am Eastern Standard Time (EST).**&amp;nbsp;    
---
Raiding begins November 12th (we will re-evalute as necessary). Members are expected to have reached level 60, acquired adequate raiding gear, completed the required attunement, and be versed in raid mechanics by this time. This should give members enough time to enjoy the content before you have to be raid ready.&amp;nbsp;    
---
We don't expect everyone to have perfect attendance; Life comes first. That being said, we really appreciate a heads up when possible, and we do expect you to be present more often than not both physically and mentally.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**We're looking for people to play roles, not classes! Play whatever class you believe you will have the most fun playing! Roles are first come, first serve as we establish the guild. We are currently recruiting all positions and classes __besides tanking__.**&amp;nbsp;    
---
For raid composition, we're aiming for a Main Tank, an Offensive Tank, 2 Alternate Tanks, 8 Healers, 14 Melee Damage, and 14 Ranged Damage. Roles will be assigned as you join the guild so that we know what we are looking for as we continue to recruit.&amp;nbsp;    
---
The loot system is a rotating loot council comprised of the Guild Master, a selection of two random officers, and two random guild members. The piece will be awarded to the guild member who the council believes will make the biggest impact on our progression. Be ready to put the guild before your ego! You will get pieces, I promise.

Hold on there, you are assuming modern day technology can only hold the same amount of people as they did in Vanilla, which is very wrong. Modern day technology allows servers to hold many many more people than 3 thousand.

They don't even have one. That's the funny part. Triggered over an idea he said he likely wasn't evne doing, kek
---
Damn you Eu love advertising your server.   You are already taking pride in it.   I guess maybe the NAs just don't have a home?
---
No, this is terrible advice. Just add it to the config...
---
Oh was it just ociana not getting them? I guess for some dumb reason I thought they were not a thing
---
If that's your play time, I'd focus on leveling first. It's gonna take you quite some time to get to 60, even if you're speed leveling.

I think you misunderstand my original point/s though. It comes across as if you think I want layering and it has no problems. That’s not the case at all, in an ideal world there’d be no layering or with layering there’d be no problems. Unfortunately that’s not the case, there are issues with it it’s not perfect but people saying that complete overpopulation and not being able to play is better are just a bit naive.
---
A layer has the same amount of players as a whole vanilla server so it’s not like it will completely ruin immersion, I know these videos or bugs of things phasing are really bad, also the vendor and rare mob sharing but I read that there’s a cap on switching layers so this can’t be spammed, also Im not defending blizzard but I’m sure this will be addressed if it’s a problem. 
---
Look, bringing up issues like you did is fine and whereas I don’t agree fully I can see them as legitimate concerns. What i don’t agree with and actually fucking hate is the overreacting and bullshitting by a lot of toxic kids about the system, making up scenarios to fit their narrative.
---
Layering is just so 👎
---
That racial would save you a couple of hours and then becomes a completely dead racial. Maybe it’s worth considering if you’re going for the scarab lord mount since that’s time sensitive and is a massive grind.
---
You must feel proud. You say it like it's an accomplishment. 
---
I've been playing WoW since its first launch week. That first month was a horrible experience. It was literally unplayable.
---
Which is why limiting the layers to starting zones would've been great, however that's not what their doing. They're layering the entire continent, including the cities. And it's not limited to launch, the layers are gonna exist at **least** for the entire duration of phase 1, which when it comes to building a community IMO is by far the most important phase.
---
2 english pvp servers means that vast majority of european players will be limited to only the 2.
---
That sounds like you're copping out.
---
"Sapped girls can't say no" was a fairly well known guild on one of EUs most populated servers, so they're not too strict.
---
Yah, I'd avoid the fraudsters channel.
---
If its not obscene, its fine. 
---
Basically, calling yourself "The Idiots" is okay. Calling yourself "The Dicks" is not okay. 
---
"Your momma" is an okay guild name. "Your momma's vagina" isnt.
---
Basically common sense. "If you were in kindergarten near a teacher and a bunch of kids, would it be okay to say your guild's name out loud?". If the answer is "no", then dont use it.
---
cerveza mui bueno

Layering, no one can see other posts because people only post about layering.

---
Same way with layering 'only lasting a few weeks'.
---
This was never said by anyone at Blizzard. There were a few comments of 'we hope....' etc. but right now it's the start of phase 2 which is ~6 months
---
Except you have to run to each dungeon. You outlevel them eventually. That’s not gonna work.
---
and no blood elves!
---
I am actually more worried about the Polish. In Burning Legion EU almost all general chats are in Polish.
---
I am talking about concurrent online players. Sorry didn't make that clear.
---
The initial period won't be different from any other server. Lots of spam, because everybody and their mother is playing. And since the spawn aren't up, people will spam.
---
And I don't think that a couple of people standing next to asmongold spamming "bald" in chat, forming "bald" in the ground will have any impact on your gaming experience. It's the same as gold sellers, who advertised their websites with corpses and spammed trade chat. And nobody really cared about them THAT much.
---
well, Swedes also have Glass wich means ice cream in swedish, but glass in Norwegian, Danish and English
---
But how do I know what servers aren’t streamer servers. I don’t watch streams so....
---
*weren't* too strict.
---
We live in a much more PC culture now and the Blizzard-Activision of today is not the Blizzard of 15 years ago.
---
I can't help what your spergy brain hears
---
Probably not. I had to take a break from that project. I spent 6+ months working on it just to get to level 40 and still couldn’t reach exalted. I’m glad you like it, but I have no plans to make it into an addon.
---
And that's just private server players. A lot of players wanting classic also avoided private realms because of the sketchiness feeling of playing a blizzard game not endorsed by the company or never even heard of them. Now that it's official, those players are a lot more interested.
---
This is the argument i'm so scared of. They fuck off Classic and afterwards it's the fault of the community instead of the devs.
---
Fucking hate server merges. Loosing your char names, the empty server will have people that gathered certain materials without any contest, tanking the combined server economy. And when adding servers together, it will ALWAYS result in HORRIBLE Ally to Horde ratio.
---
Yeah, I think they are just getting one pvp and one pve realm. Not even a normal RP realm.
---
Me and my friends are going shazzrah horde(swedish)! Cu in silithus!
---
Layering is phasing, no? Each layer of players are phased into their own instance, are they not?
---
Psychiatrist: "Your mom told me when you were 4 you got a nintentdo."
---
Jeremy: "No, when I was 4 I got Shadowword: Pain."
---
Psychiatrist: "It also says you refused to eat or drink for several days."
---
Jeremy: "Lol, priests don't need to eat! And drinking? Maybe if I'm totally out of mana but I got a high-spirit build!"

You sound like fun...

# 💠 &lt;Hubris&gt; 💠
---
Type: Hardcore PvE &amp; PvP
---
Faction: Horde
---
Realm: PvP (EU)
---
Loot: Council / List
---
Raid Time: 19:00 - 23:00 (server time)
---
Raid Days: Mondays &amp; Thursdays (During ramp-up for world #1 race, we will add Wednesday as an extra raid day to practice on PTR)
---
# 💠 **Expectations:** 💠
---
We expect members of our Raiding Squad and PvP Squad to be competitive. In raids we expect you to always bring consumables, world buffs and a good mood. It’s not mandatory participating and ranking in PvP, but we highly encourage it.
---
# 💠 **About Hubris:** 💠
---
Everyone has their own definition of fun. Our definition is being a part of a tight-knitted community with social and good-humored individuals; who always strive to be the best but never forgets to have some fun while at it. We are looking for like-minded players who share these values.
---
The core of the guild is mostly made up of Norwegians and Swedes who came to play together on several private servers. The guild itself has been in development since early 2017. We are a light-hearted bunch who have our fun min-maxing the game and testing the limits of WoW’s mechanics and gameplay. We are ready for one final round of vanilla (yeah right...) where we will go all-out!
---
Most Hubris members played retail vanilla way back; now many of us are now pushing past 30. With age comes responsibilities in the shape of families and careers. We want to spend our days in our underwear, farming dungeons, raids and crushing the alliance. 
---
We are looking for people that shares our same state of mind. If you answer yes to any of these questions you might be Hubris material!
---
* Are you able to read through this rather long recruitment post?
---
* Are you using vacation days to play classic at launch?
---
* Do you want to rank past 12?
---
* Want to top individual logs for your class?
---
* Are you able to wake up in the middle of the night for a 10 min world boss kill, then resume your sleep?
---
* Mind clearing all 40 man raids up until phase 5 in a single raid night?
---
* Would you enjoy a drunken Zul'Gurub raid on friday nights?
---
# 💠 **Hardcore Gameplay:** 💠
---
Previous experience within Hubris include:
---
* Members being part of world 5th retail Kel’thuzad kill (in guild [Forte](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Boulderfist_Europe/Forte))
---
* Members being part of Aphorism, top 10 EU high-end guild in TBC &amp; WOTLK
---
* [Killing Hakkar in mere seconds with 52k+ ignite stack](https://youtu.be/11M--EYik_s?t=2849)
---
* Many DPS world records in RealmPlayers (private server logs) including:
---
   * Hakkar 5100 DPS
---
   * Gahz’ranka 3500 DPS
---
   * Golemagg 3400 DPS
---
* Speed-running: MC (&lt;30mins), BWL (&lt;60mins), AQ40 (&lt;60mins), Naxx (&lt;90mins)
---
* Many ex-Rank 14 PvPers, both from Retail and Private Servers
---
* 6 months of World Boss Monopoly at one of the largest private server and its successor.
---
* Ragnaros defeat within 13 days of a new PS release (which is a goal we aim to improve. This time within the first reset of retail vanilla)
---
We put a high emphasis on improving boss tactics, theorycrafting and finding the optimal raid setup. Hubris has a subsidization policy, which involve the guild bank providing members with a part of the cost. For instance members can trade a flask for the mats except the \[Black Lotus\].
---
To keep raiding from getting stale (outside of the world #1 kill races) we usually try to spice it up with speedruns, speed kills, and going for top ranks on individual DPS logs. This is a great way to keep content exciting and fun while waiting for the next patch update.
---
# 💠 **World bosses:** 💠
---
One of the most exhilarating and rewarding events of vanilla is by far contesting World Bosses. Ginormous PvP battles, mixed with great boss fights and top-notch loot and gear.
---
The GM of Hubris was one of the raid leaders and a founding member of the world boss alliance at a private server that starts with N and another that starts with A. Where we at one point in time had a monopoly on all the world bosses and their loot for close to 6 consecutive months.
---
There is a great competition killing the world bosses, and it’s hard to act alone as a guild. This is why we have made strategic alliances with other guilds for a higher chance of defeating our good friends Kazzak, Azuregos, Taerar, Ysondre, Lethon &amp; Emeriss.
---
# 💠 **PvP:** 💠
---
Most of our members aim to achieve R10 or higher, without being a part of the Ranking PvP Squad. At the moment our Ranking PvP Squad counts 18 people who will be going for R12 or higher, where 8 of them will be going all the way to R14.  
---
In **Phase 2** we will be organizing honor farming groups every day to ensure our PvP Squad’s honor farm and control of the brackets.  
---
In **Phase 3** we plan on becoming the strongest horde premade on the server, and by doing that: gaining control of the servers brackets. We do believe this is highly achievable based on our previous PvP experience and skill, in combination with having the best gear from PvE content.
---
# 💠 **Additional Information:** 💠
---
Vanilla is finally back, and we’re hardly able to keep it in our pants. We hopefully piqued your interest in some way and are looking forward to seeing you join the ranks of Hubris.
---
You really don’t need to be a hardcore player to be a vital part of the guild. You are just as welcome to join us as a social member; rake in the benefits of being in a great guild, without any of the pressure.
---
Hubris will run weekly PUG raids where socials and alts will have priority spots, they will aim to consistently clear all content in progressing phases.
---
The raids will be organized by Hubris officer Yonomori, through his [discord](https://discord.gg/SZUk4gH). You can find more information about the PUG:s and its requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNQ0lJpXeAnIeCllsBY8rt4ItKF8IvFDCQ_O1VnZlhs/edit?usp=sharing).
---
We are currently looking for one additional member of the following classes for our Hard Core Raiding Squad:
---
* 1 Mage (Troll race)
---
* 1 Rogues
---
* 1 Priest (PI or Holy spec)
---
* 1 Shamans (Resto for PvE, Ele for PvP Ranking)
---
Even if we are full on a certain class/spec ***all exceptional applications will be considered.*** 
---
We're also recruiting exceptional players for our PvP Ranking Squad!
---
Thank you for reading. It’s important for us to find the right people that fit within our group. Some would say we are setting the bar too high, but you got to have a little hubris to achieve your goals.

---
Oh man, this is going to be bad. It’s going to be Barrens Chat all over the server. Kinda sucks — but oh well. 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah, you're definitely copping out. Good luck.
---
Oh man that's not fair. But I guess if the player numbers are not there for that region.
---
It's just fucking retarded to translate series/movies. Loses the entire feeling with low tier voice overs instead of the real feelings conveyed through the actors themselves. I speak german (in addition to Swedish, English, and Jugoslavian) and watching shows in german is so fucking bad.
---
But this has nothing to do with that? Isn't why you loved this game the interactions etc? This is a very helpfull tip, I never even knew about /world since a couple days ago from this subreddit. 
---
I don't see how this is dramatic at all but ok. Sure.
---
&lt;clearly&gt; is recruiting!
---
Horde-Fairbanks
---
We will be raiding 8:30pm-11pm pacific
---
Loot will be distributed via Loot Council, in conjunction with class leads / myself and other officers, we will ensure a fair loot council.
---
We are currently in high need of Warlocks, shamans(resto), and 2 druids(resto). Although we are always recruiting any exceptional players.
---
I'm creating this guild to clear raid content and do wpvp/bgs with friends. I raid-lead in vanilla for 1 year, then on a vanilla pserver for 2 years; you can trust that this loot council won't be corrupt/biased whatsoever. Bringing back lots of old friends/raiders and looking for more people to fill out the roster. Can already tell the culture in this guild will be fantastic.
---
If this sounds good to you add me on bnet at Chase#13656, message me here on reddit, or add Sneakyshadow#9420 on discord!(Sneakyshadow#1423 on bnet) (Don’t forget capitalization matters on discord!)
---
My friend had a warlock pet named Sharoom. Whenever he'd have it charge in he'd yell Sharoom BOOM. (like racoom boom from DBZ) even old guildmates still brought that up a decade later. I love these random things that people remember about vanilla.

Waiting for the first "I got layered on the elevator and died" post. I thought this was it :(
---
Ahh okay, I think there's an addon that lets me import guides :) will be making use of it on release. Thanks for putting all that time into it and tailoring it to Rogues/people who want to get rep early!
---
Why are you talking about merges?
---
Yeah, but it is in the vast majority of peoples opinions that after a month or so a ton of people will quit. Which they probably will. I'm not certain, but I think they said that is why they are relying so much on layering upon launch and how it would be phased out. They know there is a lot of hype around classic and even the amount of servers they have provided probably won't be enough upon launch, but WoW isn't the type of game everyone likes to play and after the hype dies down a lot of people will go back to other games.
---
Idd, all the layering bullcrap, it was not needed 15years ago so why now.
---
I linked you a picture not an article. You must have a virus
---
That's good. Cheers :)

What time zone are you in? I’m gonna assume a US one, try an NZ based oceanic guild?

Do you actually have a factual basis for making that assumption?
---
Yeah funny that. It seems like so-called PvPers where quick to segregate onto servers on which their side was dominating in order to avoid having to deal with World PvP and ganking. Who would have thought?

Yeah. exactly like that.

I have a feeling it's what a lot of players want unfortunately. More and more people are crazy shy online and don't want to talk with anyone they don't know. Pretty sad.
---
Oh I figured you were suggesting taking out layering and just adding more servers. My bad for assuming. That just seems like a popular opinion here that I dislike.
---
This is excellent. People chasing their one prebis item while they have several easy upgrades available in another dungeon are gimping themselves and their guild for those early runs (am guilty). You're still allowed to do dungeons after you're raiding.
---
for what? tl:dr of the OP : dont join world because in the end someone is gonna be a dick and ban you, its not a blizzard regulated channel... thats correct its a community regulated channel.
---
in the reply i said : what you saying is speculation and not experience. because it doesnt happen, because pserver community where /world started is alot more serious and mature.
---
then i gave an example of how beta/stresstest chat was pure cancer where world (tho alot smaller on beta/stresstest) was more mature.
---
again good talk, maby next time try to have a discussion with more then 1 sentence.
---
Saving to read later at work. Cheers for all your hard work! Just a quick glance through it and there is a lot of research in here. Much appreciated.
---
Look like you just don't know how to use it, because actually, you can do all these things since a long time already.
---
Do we know if any streamers are on either server yet? And if there's going to be an influx of non English people on one of them?

# &lt;Doggo Noir&gt;US-East PvP | Thanlos | Alliance | Semi-Hardcore | Boosted Discord Server
---
We are a Casual-hardcore raiding guild. What does that mean? Well, the casual being we do not intend to set world first or expect you to be 60 in 2 weeks we will be taking our time and hope to be 60 in about 6 weeks. This also means that if you happen to miss a raid you won’t receive a /gkick. And the hardcore? Well, the hardcore bit means we will be taking raids seriously and will be expecting people to do what is demanded of their class/role and to come prepared with consumables and knowledge of raid fights.
---
Other than that, the guild in its current state is very relaxed. Our members range from 29-35 and all have their shit together irl. Our application process involves a brief chat just to make sure you will mesh well with us. Nothing too serious though. Please look over the rest of our details to see if &lt;Doggo Noir&gt; fits well with you and how you hope to play classic. 
---
**Schedule:**
---
Raids: *Tuesday/Thursday 7pm - 11pm EST*
---
We plan on progressing through end game content at a steady pace that makes sense to our Guilds members. We do plan on reaching and clearing Naxx when that content is available. 
---
**Loot system**
---
*Loot Reservation.*
---
We believe in rewarding members for showing up and performing well during raids but found several issues with the loot council and DKP system. This is a straightforward system that guarantees loot for raiders. There is no bidding, no luck, no council. You put what items you want on a list before we enter the raid and if it drops, it’s yours, it’s as simple as that.
---
**How to join:**   
---
Please take 5 minutes to fill out this application, jump in our discord and someone will get back to you within the day!

dont remember, i have 23 h on lvl 15 xD
---
Doesn't matter, some BIS stuff is low level
---
Colemagg sounds awesome
---
No, I definitely went to this place while playing retail back in the day.
---
Yep, just much easier to figure out this way
---
I am a bit out of the loop. Can anyone tell me what the issue is?
---
Is layering a form of "instancing" players in different game pools? If so, how does it work? Can one be transferred to a different (and more populated) instance by being invited to a group, for example?
---
How does this divide the players? Will the game be empty?
---
Don't worry. All countries are full of idiots but not everyone is retarded :)
---
What ever happened to layering being only in the lower level zones? Cities should be excluded, look at the floor when you walk into the city!

Blizzard said right click reports won't be a ban until it is reviewed by a human.
---
i tested things dosent have a soeed run
---
I think there's a big difference between what is viable and what is optimal. I played classic back in the day and saw plenty of protection paladins or feral druids doing just fine at tanking. There's a YouTube user called Skarm who has tanked all of Naxx as a bear druid. Paladins are great for tanking 5 man's, especially ones with undead in, such as scholomance and stratholme. We had a prot pally in our Zul Gurub raid and he did a fine job. The biggest issues with them are mana and threat, but as alliance you do have the salvation buff, and if people are mindful of their threat a paladin can be just fine! Again it all boils down to what is optimal VS what is viable. If you really wanted to tunnel vision raid progression you would just take warriors, mages and priests and have one of each other classes for the relevant buffs and debuffs, but that's no fun. The hybrid specs are often jack of all trades but masters of none, I don't think it would be balanced if druids were the best tanks, DPS and healers, but the option to be able to do all 3 things at a reasonable level is what makes them appealing I'd say!
---
A lot of the top PVP and PvE players I played with in vanilla are returning for classic.  Some of those guys were legit amazing and it will be interesting to see all the rank 1's and streamers face up to some of these dudes.
---
Just because some players are not "known" doesnt mean they cant play well.
---
I agree with you entirely, just putting that quote out there as a possible explanation. You are right that the stress test should be as similar to launch as possible, but perhaps they were still testing layering a bit which might be why they extended the stress test to 4 days.

Wife and I are going to be playing WoW Classic quiet heavily during funky hours. We both have a ton of flexibility in our jobs so we plan on playing 11am-3pm EDT 4-5 days a week while the kids are at daycare and getting our "real work" done while they are sleeping.
---
Any guilds have raiding hours during this timeframe?
---
It seems they don't really care even that most people want layering to be removed.
---
&gt;It’s a city on a level 15 stress test
---
The maximum level has no bearing whatsoever on layering.
---
&gt;The stress test at the end of the weekend probably has a lot less playing than at the start
---
And layering is not adapting fast enough. You're arguing that this behaviour is different from what is going to happen on Classic's release, but this is *exactly* what Blizzard is planning on happening. They are expecting an absolutely massive drop in players during the first phase, the so-called tourists. What we can see from the behaviour of layering on the stress-test is that the layering system is **not** able to adapt to a massive and fast drop in population and keep full layers.
---
&gt;Anyone that is playing now are for the most part out levelling or testing outside zones not sitting in cities
---
Your first argument seemed to be that people don't stick around for a test that only goes to level 15. Now you're arguing that despite the max level is only 15, people are still out and about in the world busy doing stuff? 
---
&gt;Blizzard stated the layering threshold was way way lower to test the system as fewer people are playing the stress test.
---
The only result of this change should be the number of layers as well as the number of people on each layer. I'll give you that people REE'ing at the low number of people are overreacting, but this doesn't explain all the incredibly wonky behaviour we're seeing like ~~sharding

I'm in that Nost screenshot, it was the last day of the server where everyone was online and saying goodbye. You can't really compare that to a stress test. It's as biased as can be really and as others have pointed out in the thread, Blizzard is testing the layering function.
---
tbh just in general, I see no purpose to using it anywhere outside the lvl 1-12 zones.
---
The only areas that will be packed are the starting zones and then the zones located immediately outside the starting zones. After that point, people will spread out a lot more and things will be fine.
---
Initially my understanding was that they would only use layering in those zones for like 2 weeks max.
---
It currently seems like they are using layering everywhere in the world potentially for the entirety of phase 1. With how few realms there are and how popular the game will be, idk how they are even going to operate.

---
If you played vanilla or on a private server, listen well and perform in raids, don't have all the time in the world but are able to still adequately prepare for raids and want to raid from MC to Naxx with a great group of non-toxic people, Omega is for you
---
In retail, German language players are roughly 25% of the European player base (at least that's what realmpop.com indicates). 12% are French, 14% Russian and English and all the rest ist 50%.
---
The German playerbase is half the size of the "English + all the rest" and has less than half the server number (1 PvP/PvE each but not RP-realm). So the DE servers will likely at least as crowded as the EN ones, don't worry.
---
The French and Russian servers, on the other hand, might be a different story, considering that their respective playerbase is roughly half the size of the German one while still getting the same number of servers.
---
Yes, it's called using your brain. SoUrCe?!
---
Not at all. He judged the test server (made specifically to test layering - just so you observe how intelligent this person is), even made a long post - while acting completely clueless. He states the test realms are empty - when everyone everywhere is seeing very crowded servers. He might maybe open the internet, websites, Twitch - to observe that what he says is only true for a very small part of the population is not representative for the entire population. Instead of even taking into account his findings could not be representative for the entire playerbase, he goes on and makes the assumption that everyone had the same experience (you can tell how intelligent he is just by this thing alone) and demands that Blizzard do something about - not only this, but calling them clueless (notice how superior he believes his logic process is? he's quite certain his logic is infailible). Even more, just to see how 'intelligent' he is, he goes on to compare this with Nostalrius on the last day when all 10k ppl logged in on the same server. He has no clue Blizz splits the entire server into possibly 10+ layers.
---
Maybe he should just go read what layering is and how it works instead of qqing and acting surprised and demanding what exactly? That layering be removed. I mean lol...
---
This guy should have been specifically placed by Blizz in a layer with 8k people in Elwynn and be forced to level in there. Until that happens, I'm pretty sure the dude will live in its own world, ignoring any facts about any form of server splitting.
---
Cities Skylines
---
Seems really fucking bad for the health of those servers to add them late
---
Looks pretty crap when you don't know how to take a screenshot.
---
You know, I didn't notice that as I was fishing on the new water. I forgot how straining it is to fish in the old water.
---
A timeless *classic*!
---
Definately gonna try to team up with a warrior with my hunter pre 10.
---
/world chat is not true vanilla. It is strictly a private server shitstain. 
---
The issue is, in private servers /world chat is monitored and regulated by the server creator as a true Global Channel(like Blizzard-made channels like LookingForGroup is handled).
---
Creating a channel with a custom name(such as "World" or "Global") is a bad idea in real vanilla/Classic. The adminstrative powers fall on the longest standing member of the channel(one who has been logged in the longest in current session). That 1 guy and him alone can ban anyone off the channel with no way to unban other than him doing it manually.
---
Next time read the OP.
---
There’s a reason LFG Hogger was a thing.
---
 https://images.app.goo.gl/4yTY4hStix41Gyqv9
---
i mean, could it be for all the low ass leveled stress testers, even on the realm with people there wouldnt be many in cities?
---
May I pick your brain and ask what the rationale is? Soda, weed and junk food sounds like it goes hand in hand with classic, it seems odd that you would prepare yourself so drastically different from this. I mean super cool but why? Could you explain your thought process?
---
You are so delusional it's funny.
---
Xokas is completely irrelevant, and most of his followers will stop playing 1 week after launch.
---
Oceanic Horde - Arugal - Planning to make an Undead Mage on launch. Looking to level with another Undead Mage.
---
My preferred levelling path is Tirisfal glades until Brill, get to around level 8 or 9, then hop on the zeppelin and continue from The Barrens. Will try to fit in some instances where possible and not out of the way.
---
Bro... You cant read. He just said the /world Channel is moderated by admins on private servers, which it isnt on blizz.. And youre like "ThiS nEvER HApPENED On prIVaTE sERveRS" hence you cannot be banned by random players there for no reason. So no shit, it didnt happen. Read the post next time
---
I'm with you, but the majority of people don't have the time to deal with that kinda stuff these days. It would seriously hurt the health and future of the game.
---
Bear 2-3 shots stuff at lvl 10-11 :D
---
This is so cool, thankyou very much for taking the time to do it! I've always wondered about MoD and it's effectiveness (I still always took it on P.servers regardless).
---
I was playing stress test with massive amount of players in all starting areas.I expect the fps to be less ofc in a raid or AV environment but definately playable. Like I said its preset 3 and some settings are even on “High” with this preset- still possible to go even lower and get better fps. No more than 60 for me anyways cause my monitor is merely 60 Hz like most laptops.
---
Undead are zombies, this denial is going too far.
---
i said mccool was cool not noble. but you might be right idk man
---
Same with my friends! Seems like tryhard are going Shazzrah.
---
I’m taking 7 days off for launch and I’ll be pretty happy if I can hit 50 before going back to work. I feel like that is realistic
---
Thanks a bunch. As a feral druid I would love the rogue stuff (I'm guessing it's the combo points)? Are they included in the pack? I'm at the phone so can't quite see what's inside.
---
A lot of them probably have at least a subscription to the game but no I wouldn't be surprised if it's 50/50
---
You're our savior! Thank you &lt;3

How come there is no option to download the census and demographics survey like there is for the server demographics survey?
---
Super curious. How were the servers during this? Like was there any server lag at all?
---
In BFA, the entire server starts crashing if there are more than 40 players in a single zone.
---
Italians, Spanish, Polish and Scandis are going Shazzrah. Seems like there will be quite a long queue for that one.
---
Source? If it's true, that eases my mind a bit.
---
Mate there is two PVP servers it doesn’t really matter either way pick one and play
---
You're just jelly of his good looks and popularity.
---
Well, apparently these bigger ”coalitions” have decided to go on shazzrah, at least to my understanding from Brits, Scandinavia (swedes basically) and Spain. But to be honest, the amount of those players are minimalistic compared to the whole server, and wont propably even be noticeable. People like to just over exaggerate on such drama.
---
This gives a quite good representation of the current situation: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTfTNjcThmoe_47K8mbf8IffpfK0XrBCFWE4X5X97wY/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true&amp;pru=AAABbKXwf9U*7KxPV8GlbrSeo-lqHxAsVQ
---
That's a private server thing, not a vanilla thing, so I'm good with it not being a thing in classic.
---
Golemagg is easy to pronounce if you break up the word. "Golem-agg". Not sure if this is correct but to me it makes sense.
---
I mean, I’d prefer anything that takes out layering at this point.
---
But the easy solution is that more servers will be added period. Blizz is being very clear about that.
---
no, those people should stay in retail instead of ruining classic.
---
Even if it kills the game, there will still be private servers so just chill out pal. The sky isn’t falling until it’s falling.
---
There's a bulletpoint which is just "What the fuck". Solid argumentation, much logic.

---
Thanks for giving everyone the idea.
---
Probably not since every single server would be a ghost town after a month without it
---
Oh yeah for sure, the point is that it is very much towards the end of summer. Which ties with the point that if they said layering will be removed by phase 2, it won't be half way through phase 1, or early phase 1 - it'll be the very end of phase 1, possible the last few days of it.
---
Almost, but you just had to add a snarky remark.
---
So do you prefer BFAs system where mana is essentially. Non factor? Like they could literally remove it from retail lmao
---
You sound mad, brainlet.
---
The only possible reason to take Esfand, Asmongold etc as your character name is to deny them of theirs. It doesn't have anything to do with you WANTING the name, it's just that you want to be a dick towards them. Hence I don't have any issues with them getting to reserve their names.
---
If people are around when you're questing, throw them an invite. Make friends and influence people to have fun.
---
true
---
but the best one is shutting down cause these clowns at blizz promised true classic experience :(
---
In fact, it just ticlke my mind, how much strong it is, to be like, level 2 or 4, and be bless by a level 50+ character, like Arcane intelligence, or paladin's blessings   
---
Its seems 20 is much much over what you get even full stuff level 5
---
Rejoignez nous !

---
Oh -- he saw it on trade chat I supposed. So even if the server is split between multiple layer, my thought is that the chat is 'server-wide', for all the layers.
---
Or, if he saw it in front of his eyes and then that player dissapeared, moved to another layer - then this is obviously just a testing tech thing - as, how layering will work at release is that ppl can only change a layer at login/logout or when travelling to another continent.
---
IT'S REPLICATING
---
Most members of my guild never touched a city :| were all out leveling or burgeoning or pvping. Cities are where crafters and 60s hang out
---
They said they are open to player input and are listening but I'm sure they aren't gonna make any announcements until they see how much money Classic is gonna make them.
---
Why test a mechanic that they shouldn't be using anyway? Layering is a bad idea and contrary to the vanilla experience, so why the need to test it?
---
Who are you in discord, you deserve top shazz content creator.
---
That’s so weird because I did too and I struggled getting 60. What graphic settings were you using? I have the same specs but only a 250gb drive which shouldn’t change much. What’s your GPU?? I struggled playing with classic settings with textures up to 10 with retina so I lowered the resolution to around 60% which gave me 60 fps more often than not. So you’re playing with 100% rendering resolution?
---
Thats very good. My bro (pally) and I (warrior) did a couple of speed runs to 10 and were getting 1:40-2:00. We tried one to 15 but got bogged down for 45 minutes trying to complete a low drop chance quest in the loch. Its a 1 off and we were already slightly ahead of guide so probably skipping it on the real rush.
---
Cause Shazzrah sounds better :)
---
I personally don't entirely mind provided the streamers all pick the same server to do their stuff on. Streamer communities can enjoy their shit on that server and leave the rest of us who don't want to take part in it on another. I can't fault people for wanting to be part of something. Even if it looks pretty dumb to me.
---
Hehe, my wife started one this friday on the stress test :P
---
I didn't try.
---
As a Brit, I'm envious that you got this name of my favourite town in WoW.
---
Enjoy Classic! :)
---
Holy shit you’re angry calm down

**Incarnation** [A] | NA-PvP | Mon/Tues/Weds | 7-10 pm PST | Hardcore | loot council
---
Server realm: Fairbanks or Whitemane 
---
Hi everyone!
---
&lt;Incarnation&gt; is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community. If you take the time to talk with us you'll see our passion and that we're taking this seriously.
---
**About Us:**
---
We have a solid core group and are looking to add a few more exceptional players to our roster. Our leadership core contains the following: multiple top 20 KT kills, Rank 14, multi season gladiators, complete private server progression, and competitive world rankings in other games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations. All the information is out there, such as boss mechanics and dps rotations. Even those new to classes/specs will be held to a high standard. We expect before applying you research and understand the basic mechanics and rotations of the class you're applying for.
---
**Expectations:**
---
We're currently fine tuning our raids weekly to ensure once launch comes we progress with minimal delay. Incarnation has an in house instant 60 server we use to ensure every member exceeds standards. We expect our members to be knowledgeable about each encounter and have adequate consumables available for progression.
---
**Recruitment:**
---
Open: Rogues / Hunters / Warriors (fury)
---
Closed: Druids / Paladins / Mages / Warlocks / Priest
---
**Application:**
---
Apply on the website [https://www.incarnationguild.com/](https://www.incarnationguild.com/)or join us on discord at [https://discord.gg/St9mCuP](https://discord.gg/St9mCuP)
---
tbh I already have plans for like 3 warrior characters
---
You arent really living if you arent playing classic though, so /played and /lived should always stay nearly identical.
---
Are eggplants a French thing?
---
Best part about vanilla is the game is enjoyable at all character levels not just max level!
---
Swolemagg definitely the better choice than lame Shizzrah ;)
---
Thats great to hear. Do you think that at 3 we could get around 30 fps on raids?
---
No tryhards on Golemagg.
---
eggplant in French is "Aubergine" :)
---
This makes me want to roll on an rp realm and gank rpers lmao
---
We’re telling you that Blizzard has, in the past and till this day, taken a stance that PvP is PvP. Even if it’s excessive ganking. You can quote TOS all you want but Blizzard has not operated that way.
---
Your tool says reservations are in 2 hours. They should be in 11...
---
They are testing something they shouldn't even use. What's the idea behind that? Layering should not be used at all so testing it makes no sense.
---
It might seem like that to you, but no. They'll be absolutely fine. Like every single time Blizzard has added more servers in the past.
---
Nah but I zipped them here, energy/combo pt trackers.
---
https://puu.sh/E4g9U/0c16134e96.zip
---
Too lazy to pull all the luas for these, type /nen unlock and /ncb unlock to move them.
---
This sounds anything but stupid. Keep the good work and may the RNG be with you.
---
Wtf is all this crying about layering?
---
I prefer layering over lagging through the starting areas for hours...
---
Even with layering there was a huge amount of Players you have to deal with.
---
Literally several raid groups spent half an hour or more trying to get into the right layer to participate in this.
---
We all know Golemagg is an absolute gangster and therefore doesnt need too much appraisal. Shazzrah on the other hand is insecure and skinny, and needs support.
---
Look, I don’t think that layering is the solution or the right way to go. However, I would have more fun actually playing the game than to wait 10 hours in a queue. 
---
Even if it isn’t true that blizzard had lowered the treshold for the beta, I never had any trouble finding groups nor did the world feel empty. It wasn’t crowded by any means, but there were people around everywhere.
---
If they remove layering within a month like they said they would, I sure won’t complain. I see lots of people with predictions about how they will keep layering forever or how no one will want to transfer to new servers. 
---
Let’s save our outrage for when that actually happens. Blizzard have fucked up before, but I like to think that they can make their decisions based on more data and logic than your average redditor.
---
This looks like an excellent place to have a duel tournament. Players fighting inside the ring, and spectators outside of it. Even has a few spots where you can LOS as well, since you cant run out of range here.
---
that’s exactly how it was go back to bfa to play your panda
---
1) Nost as a server where people from all over the planet played during it's final hours 
---
2) A stress test server where not only is it region based where people will test with their best ping, but a city that has zero impact on a level 15 character.
---
Pick one.
---
The only problem is that "Auberdine" in french is close to the word "Aubergine" which is a fucking eggplant. 🍆  
---
Server Eggplant doesn't sound that epic.
---
It didn't work, people kept getting bonked off the layer aftering doing exactly that. Sometimes entire groups would be kicked off the layer into an empty one.
---
Dude if you play invoker go druid. They have the most forms and spells and stuff to manage.
---
People actually download addons manually... in 2019? Huh, color me shocked. Twitch is so much easier (and the classic filter isn't there).
---
This is exactly the experience I sign up for. That's vanilla, that's classic. I don't care for your tags or whatever, that's how the game works. Be smarter.
---
I mean yes, they want as many people as possible to play so they can make money.
---
Are name reservations done in client or a webpage?
---
With three kids they won’t have to depend on anyone for doing  dungeons.
---
No?  Cus it is.
---
TIL
---
The community doesn't want layering
---
Is this throwing LUA errors for here be dragons for anyone else? If so how did you fix?
---
Oh yeah there will be more servers no doubt.
---
lol, Shattered Hand EU?
---
I was going to say, I thought the whole ides of this stress test the past weekend wasn't to see if the servers are stable (since you know, they have been running an MMO for 15 years and seem to be able to keep it running) but rather to test all the layering and transitions players have from one layer to another.
---
Keeping the layer numbers low assures players transfer more often, giving them more chances to identify issues the servers will have with the process.  I don't think what we experienced with this stress test will be what we get when Classic goes live.
---
That's a pretty selfish view. "People should have to wait in 5 hour ques or go back to retail!!!"
---
Determine if I am mad, bro
---
Yet you're still super cereal, enjoy classic stranger :)
---
Wait, it's today??!?!? Where did my weekend go!
---
People shouldn't view it as unimportant. The first 15 levels or so are when players get hooked. Nobody decides at lvl 45 after 3 months that they finally like the game. It's right at the beginning.
---
If that beginning experience is ruined by layering, then people won't really want to play at all.
---
Your tool only works for people in your time zone... it’s a countdown to 3pm local time.
---
My god can we stop spreading misinformation?
---
Hmmm you know what this seems pretty legit to me.... saves me having to buy an MMO mouse aswell. 
---
Cheers man think I’m gonna give this a go.
---
So, how many cars did you see on the highway?
---
Ah just a few.
---
Oh so exactly 3, perfect.
---
Dont you know all the fun stuff happens in the first few weeks? After 2-3 weeks youll never make friends again.

---
you can't abuse it to make world pvp a joke
---
No lag at all
---
The tool is wrong for me and it just does a count down to 3pm my time zone.
---
No viruses just a test to show you were a bot. Turns out a bot indeed!
---
im not your bro, or even A bro.
---
and you need to read... but plz downvote more because i dont share your opinion.
---
you rather crowd a channel wich is made for **finding groups** with trolls/comedians/eliteplayers just so you can talk in every zone... basicly the whole reason world started (nice fact vanilla had loads of playermade channels, its kinda like a groupapp, there is always a 2nd one with just the fun ppl)
---
his/her whole points are litterly : because its not monitored its gonna be cancer, and my reply is its not incl reasoning. 
---
have fun in your lfg chat thats being monitored ... it's funny everyone talks about community this community that. but in the end you dont trust that community and rather be regulated by a company thats not even the same as when this game released, no trust in the biggest influence part wich made classic possible finaly... the community
---
again good talk, wont reply anymore it hard discussing at your lvl

 **PRIMACY IS NOW RECRUITING FOR CLASSIC WOW! - \[H\] - SHAZZRAH PVP**   
---
 [https://primacy.shivtr.com](https://primacy.shivtr.com/) 
---
It is my pleasure to inform you that we are now recruiting all classes for the upcomming launch of classic wow.  
---
**Who are we?**   
---
&lt;Primacy&gt; is semi-hardcore guild with experienced vanilla raiders behind it, looking to make a friendly raiding enviorement which focuses on **quality** raiding. Our guildmaster have extensive raidleading experience and cleared Naxxramas on both retail (&lt;Balance&gt; Grim Batol &gt;) and Private servers (Kronos 1+2). The core of the guild is comprised of friends from former private servers and real life friends who decided we had enough nerd rage and drama, and wanted a mature raiding enviorement where everyone is having a good time. People are mostly from the Nordic countries of Europe, but we also have some members from Iceland, South Africa and France. Everyone is welcome so long you live up to our rules about respect and you talk English in guild.  
---
**Raiding system**  
---
We focus on high quality raiding. To make our raids a good experience with a friendly tone in discord. Are you looking for drama, have an immature attitude or use racial slurs, then this is not the place for you.   
---
To acheive quality raiding means that we will not accept people raiding as "meme-specs" when we are in progression raids. Some hybrid specs may be allowed if you prove your worth and if it is a benifit for the raid as a whole - eg. Tank druid, but straight up memespecs like boomkin or enhancement shaman will not be allowed. When you have full AQ40 gear, you can maybe do that in our BWL and MC raids.  
---
The loot system is undecided as of yet and will be decided upon popular vvote within the guild before the first raid. HOWEVER there will be loot council on very rare and highend loot We don't want anyone to grab a Thunderfury or Drake Fang Talisman, only to leave the guild a week later. A list of these will be agreed upon if we go for a DKP system.  
---
Aside from that DKP will see a reduction (or wipe) on the introduction of new raids (if we decide on DKP). This is to prevent DKP inflation and to give new members a chance to get a piece of gear. The details of this will be discussed later on as we have plenty time inbetween content patches to settle this. We may also run with seperate DKP system for each raidtier.  
---
**Raiding - Requirements**  
---
We will be raiding two days a week for 4 hours a raid. Raid days will be decided later on as popular vote in the guild and of days where the most important members can attend (eg. main tank), but it is decided that one raidday will be during the weekday and one during the weekend.  
---
The raid time starts at 19:00 with the raid already inside the instance. It is very important that people are on time as this can severely delay raids if we have to wait. If you are delayed for a raid you may lose your raidspot. This is to ensure people respect eachothers time - we are all adults with busy lives outside of wow. This can also be subject to change slightly if a majority of the guild wishes it.  
---
**Consumerables:**  
---
It is required that you bring enough consumerables for the entire duration of every raid. This is important to help us clear content faster so that we all have more spare time on our hands. This means Mongoose, Fire protection potions, mana potions, mana oils, JuJu's etc. A list for each class of requires consumerables will be worked out by the class leaders before the first raid.
---
**VOIP**  
---
It is expected you join the guild discord and attend the raidchannel for the entire duration of the raid.   
---
Voice communication is important to keep everyone on the same page.   
---
The guild discord can be found here [https://discord.gg/UsEMsax](https://discord.gg/UsEMsax)  
---
**Addons**  
---
We require deadly boss mods (DBM) installed for raids. This should be released shortly into the release of classic. Furthermore DPS classes should have a Threatmeter installed, while healing classes should have decursive installed (or similar function). When AQ40 is released it is required you install C'thun Warner. 
---
**Mature guild and respect for others**
---
A standard rule applies that you must be 18 or older to join the guild. This is because we don't want immature players causing drama or screaming in discord. If you are not 18 and you still want to join, just PM me on discord and we will talk about it no biggie.
---
This also means we do not tolerate ANY racism or sexism towards other guildmembers and you are expected to act profesionally towards other players aswell (also people not in the guild). Ofcause you can talk shit and make jokes as long it is with a friendly tone, but we do not want to see you talk bad about jews or use the N-word or similar stuff like this. After a initial warning you will be kicked from the guild immidiatly if you cannot comply.
---
If the guild appeals to you would maybe like to join, please apply at  [https://primacy.shivtr.com](https://primacy.shivtr.com/) 
---
Applying and going somewhere else is alright, we are all trying to figure out where to play and who to play with - but please don't apply if you KNOW you will not join the guild
---
Kind regards

All weve heard is that they would consider doing BC servers.
---
Even that was more of a passing comment, I'm not sure I could find the source.
---
Bottom line, no one knows, not even Blizzard.
---
Test something that shouldn't even be used. That's like testing group finder in the classic stress test.
---
&gt; It's going to be widely used anyways, so why even have players moderating it in the first place?
---
I mean, did you read the post..? It's only going to be "widely used" by people who have used it on private servers, because on private servers it was a default channel and administrated by the server owners. It's not going to be a widely used channel in Classic because (despite what you might believe) the majority of players won't come from private servers and wouldn't ever think of joining "world".
---
Merging 5-6 realms though would just mean one PVE and one PVP server; because they're only launching like 6 or 7 servers to begin with. LOL
---
Mah dude, nah. The guy you’re replying to never said anything about /world being good on pservers and so they would be good in classic. All he has said is that on the beta and stresstest /world was fine even without proper moderation likely because of it only really being known to the (typically) more mature pserver audience.
---
Thank god NA has an equal number of normal and PvP servers considering 80% of the player base rolls PvP....

I was doing runs to 10 and I did a Warrior then Pally and it was about 1hr 30mins each to 10.
---
Layering means you have multiple copies of the game world. If all the current layers on a server are full, another layer is created to hold new players. This means there are no queues, so servers can hold much more people than normal.
---
They have done this so we won't have to merge servers when the populations drop in the weeks after launch. 
---
The problem is the layering has been pretty glitchy so far, players have been put on different layers to other people in their party, which isn't meant to happen. Other players phasing in and out is a bit immersion breaking as well. 
---
You can also switch layers manually if someone on a different layer invites you. This enables a bunch of exploits, such as jumping layers to avoid pvp, or switching to find world bosses.
---
Tldr: Each layer is like a server, except you can be moved between layers. People don't like mobs and players phasing in and out because of this.
---
Perks of having a 30k+ server population: Just block every spaintard

Kinda weird to compare peak population private servers to the final stress test before launch like no one is particularly invested in since they've been through several already though.
---
That's fucking amazing, finally seeing people around again you mean. Layering is fucked and it takes away from the classic experience.
---
No, Spanish people are the worst. I used to work in a hotel with guests from all over the world and Spaniards (and Italians) were an absolute nightmare to deal with.

We have no idea because they literally don't communicate with us. And all the people talking about how long layering will last are  either extrapolating from very old information when Blizz. thought it was sharding or from one interview where it is obliquely mentioned. That's it.
---
Everything else is what people wish or think it is, but not what Blizz has actually said about layering or how long it will last (or how big they are, etc.).
---
Is that a rhetorical question or are you genuinely wondering? It's pretty dumb either way, just wanted to know.
---
&gt;Thanks, but im spanish and not toxic

If you have to use hyperbole and strawmen to make your argument you don't have a fucking argument.  Try reading before trying to play captain save-a-layer.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**How to join?**
---
Join our discord and i will reach out to you: https://discord.gg/STNp9aM
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!
---
**Youtube:** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvbut2LBKywSOiy_ZOnAJg&gt;   (World PvP Fights, etc.)
---
They literally didn't say this was the case for the stress test though. The stress test is not even on the beta client. It's different..
---
If you read the Wow Diary you'll hear a lot of interesting talk about how a lot of this was literally someone spending their free time just making nods to things from an RPG campaign, childhood home or an in-joke between the developers. So many things we just take for granted or laugh at (poodads, for example) started out as sparetime projects or the designers trying to mess with the team leads.
---
Other stuff, such as what you're showing here, is definitely just leftovers from the last push before release where shit got hairy.
---
Likely based on what? Your allmighty hunch? It's a stress test. They use it to test the server infrastructure. This includes testing layering, and stress testing the layering backbone. This might mean that layers are being added, removed and merged a lot more frequently and pointlessly than they'd want to do in a live server.
---
I used it as a reason to retire. LOL
---
Asmon was the only streamer taking about going pve cause he doesn't want to get ganked.
---
I'm smoking twice as much weed for both of us.
---
Why do we think we know more about the demand for classic than the multi-billion dollar company, employing analysts with years of experience and data, with a financial incentive to answer this question as best they can?
---
Had a question regarding RP servers over all. Posted my question first as a new thread but for some reason my question was against the rules and got locked. No idea why. Anyways copy pasting my post in this thread since it was the most recent Zandalar Tribe forum post.
---
Copy paste: 
---
Thinking of rolling on Zandalar Tribe RP-PVP. Have never played on a RP server before.
---
Couple of questions, regarding "out of character" and "in character". What is /1 general considered? Can you just type normally there? Also when questing and leveling. Can you ask for groups and quests in /say like you normally would? Stuff like when being in a zone waiting for a mob respawn "Anyone doing quest x and want to team up?" etc.
---
I don't plan to RP myself. Just want a more chill and mature server and I think it would be fun to see people RP as well. Want to make sure I understand what I'm getting myself into, if it's worth it.
---
That could very be, I played around with it for a bit and tried to google it I even asked in general chat, and all i got back was that it wasnt possible.
---
After looking at it again just now, i have found: https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=6554 - So i will try that when the game launches.
---
true, but also I think he's talkinga about Epstein
---
Strange, what time zone are you in? It's counting down to 3pm PDT for me
---
yes and thats gonna happen all the time. thats why people dont want to play with streamers, they are literally ruining the entire server with their cult followers
---
Not really. Most people who play will watch it because we're in hype state now. I'm watching vids 'which class to pick'  or 'surprising classic items' when I know them all and already picked a class. It's pure pleasure center triggers man.
---
Yeah, but the Swedish word for glass is still glas. Which isn't that different.
---
This is absolutely 100% not true. You would need to be exploiting some sort of system (gadgetzan roof for instance) or other such thing for Blizzard to ever intervene. Camping someone for hours might get a few eye rolls, but Blizzard would not intervene.
---
It's not stupid at all, people have different reasons to motivate themselves to change their lifestyle; yours just happens to be Classic WoW.
---
Most of us were about 12 years old when original (vanilla) WoW released. We were all fresh faced noobs when we started.
---
My advice is to just dive in and do whatever the heck you want! Don't worry about others, just make sure you're having fun. 
---
The community is (hopefully) a lot more mature than it was back then and most people are really helpful. Dont hesitate to ask for help in game. It's a great way to make friends and trust me when I say NOBODY is able to solo all of the content in Vanilla. Even low level quests can be tough and it literally requires that you group up. 
---
Hope you enjoy it as much as I did when I first played 15 years ago :) Welcome to WoW
---
the "people shouldn't worry, it's just temporary" has been regurgitated again and again, despite the fact that we have no idea how temporary it will be(they moved up the end date what, 4 times?) or how the system is supposed to actually work. There is zero communication from blizzards side. People are getting layered while in parties, while switching zones, seemingly random despite the fact that its supposed to be constant. There are SO many parts of the layering system that no one knows if they are bugs or features, because blizzard is refusing to ever adress it, just 2 weeks from launch.
---
So no, I don't agree. People SHOULD be worried because layering is utter shit in its current iteration and it will fuck over classic longterm regardless if it only sticks around for 2 months(which is the deadline now).
---
I was brought back to the exact same part. IIRC it was because there ended up being so much ground clutter, they sorta just faded into it.
---
What's gonna be the go-to raiding realm for EU english? Also is it gonna be Horde or Alliance heavy? Thanks.
---
10h, 53 min
---
You must be right, I'm still concerned by the mentality of french players on the PvP realm but that's another story
---
When you're testing something and want to gather useful data it might be the extremes you need to check. There is no point in "testing" something that you already know works. You won't get anything useful out from it. Please keep in mind that this stress test isn't something Blizzard are doing to be nice to you as a player. It's not for you or your enjoyment. It's not a demo or a preview. It's 100% done for them, for their testing.
---
Excellcior!
---
Until release, you just make a character so you've got two weeks for customisation of your look
---
My mate had a character called Dildoo, and when Blizz asked him to change it he said it was his Aboriginal name which accepted.
---
EU as in European (not EU as in European Union)
---
Seeking a semi-hardcore raiding guild on EU-Pyrewood Village. Experienced player, have played since original vanilla with breaks here and there. Available to raid any day from 20:00-20:30 CET and onwards. PM for additional details.
---
Sup Reddit. I am a yearlong Horde player who started back in 2004. I have yet to experience the side of the Alliance, hence I'd like to join team blue this time around - atleast I think I do. However, the majority of my acquaintances want to team up with the Horde. We form a 40-man guild. So has it come down to friends vs. faction? How am I to decide?
---
To clarify: My best friend goes wherever I go. He'll play a warlock and I a warrior. We intend to do some battlegrounds as well as raiding, but nothing serious. We're going on a PvP-server.
---
Obviously there's some nostalgia with teaming up with the Horde. Actually I get a slight feeling of betrayal when thinking of leaving the Horde, sigh. The character models are superior to those of the Alliance. Their whole narrative and faction unity seems greater (e.g. Lok'tar Ogar and For The Horde).
---
So help a fellow neckbeard. What am I to do?
---
TL;DR: Vanilla veteran who haven't played for the Alliance. Wants to know which faction to represent in Classic.
---
15 years ago the world was a different place. Now blizzard is a bit socially forward.
---
Can half confirm this! Got about 30 scottish nutters ready to ally with the Scandinavian hordes against the English
---
Which is pathetic, unfair, and frankly, ridiculous.
---
Hunter is very easy to play and fun!
---
Also it can seem quite intimidating when it feels like eveyone around you is a veteran player. Take your time to learn the game at your own pace and ask your SO for help if you get stuck.
---
Be polite to people you meet out in the world and you'll have a blast
---
My god, what a badass!
---
There have been several suggestions for what to do instead of layering. Included are the suggestion that 99% of other MMOs use which is create "layers" or "instances" that one pre-selects at login and which behave like an isolated server. (call is Shazzarah-1, Shazzrah-2). When population declines, you simply merge the higher layers into the lower ones to keep the density that you are aiming for. In this method, we won't be randomly getting sharded, etc. 
---
This doesn't solve all the issues with the economy but having to log in and out already puts a big damper on certain abuses and it's at worst just as bad as the current system.
---
No way, did you see the pristine condition of that poop sock? Dude is a total casual.
---
Yeah.
---
The swedish word for glass is still similar though (glas)
---
Thank you! Now I cant wait!!!
---
The rat ear quest?
---
If you are talking about corpse camping, that's not harassment, now if you grief your own faction, that's harassment.  
---
But there will be a lot of "weak men" crying about being corpse camped
---
Its a green BoE with random enchant
---
In vanilla, the specific circumstances we're talking about weren't often feasible at all, and especially not in the numbers that can be expected. Streaming has given rise to a newly viable and visible sort of mass harassment. This is more than PvP being discussed, or excesssive ganking. You don't need to patronize to me about that - I've been here from the start. I know. That's **not** exactly what's being discussed. 
---
Streaming makes it less player versus player, more people versus people.  Look around on this sub. Look at the title of this thread. It goes beyond just the ingame intent of "oh I want honor" or "fuck yea got the drop on this dude". It's massive communities of people collaborating to say "fuck these people in particular". Whether its 'blacklisting' or this, it's the same shit - people genuinely trying to ruin other people's experiences, trying to really hurt not the characters, but the people behind them.
---
Umm no fun allowed sweaty its 2019
---
&gt; Low thresholds is fine to test outdoor zones but not cities for Christ sake what are they doing?
---
Could you elaborate on this? What's your professional take on why or why not the testing of layering is fine in outdoor zones but not in a city? Is there something wrong with the data they'll get from layering Orgrimmar? Are there any specific data points or metrics you feel they won't be able to do anything useful with if they use layering in city zones?

Super Best Friends - Alliance US (EST) PVE - Pagle Server - Family/Raiding
---
Synopsis: Super Best Friends was originally created in TBC to house real life friends in our new leveling experience. During a Zul'farak run, where my prot paladin had a newly-acquired Flurry Axe, I impressed some randoms with my 1337 Dps and invited them into the guild. This bloomed and soon we had many friends of friends of friends! Now I come back 12 years later, having tracked down a number of those friends and decided to try my hand again at running a guild.
---
Focus: Leveling and PVE - While we don't frown upon PVP, and frankly I probably enjoy it the most out of our team, we will mostly be focusing on raids, using a system of DKP which fits our playstyle.
---
Playstyle: Casual/Raid Focused - Let's be honest, we're not in college anymore, and most of have full time lives, working or taking care of our families, or both. I know I have a daughter on the way, and plenty of us have responsibilities. However, we are all WoW veterans and have a good understanding of Vanilla raiding. Wed/Thurs 6pm-10pm(11pm if progression) EST.
---
Motto: "We'll make it work"
---
Are we a good fit? - We are a guild with realistic outlooks towards the game. We all want to raid and enjoy the magic that is Vanilla WoW together, but within the appropriate scheduling of our real lives. We are also older now, which isn't a requirement, but understand that most of the guild to start will be around 30+. We are not going to have squabbles over nonsense, be relaxed while enjoying what the game has to offer. We will joke and kid around, but if anyone starts to bother another, it will be dealt with appropriately.
---
Please contact me directly here or on discord at TheNerdCop#3708 if interested.
---
Fuck them little Shizzrah pumpnuggets! Swolemagg ftw!
---
and it still feels very empty and bad. Even worse since you would expect playing an mmo that you see people and run into them etc. Not have them disappear infront of your eyes and a new set of people flash in but the zone is always very empty.
---
grumble grumble if someone says something I don't like then they must be trolling!
---
They speak it well but their inherent arrogance and snobbiness tends to carry on their accent even if their persona is decent. Most unfortunate, but luckily it's mostly the midland swedes that have this flaw. Some norwegians have it too but it's quite rare.
---
It levels up extremely quickly, generally every other swing to begin with, you can hit max level in like an hour.
---
You really don't have to worry about it, you just have to ensure that when you do get a new weapon you level it.
---
Events like this might be why Cities are empty, should we be blaming Layering at this point?  just putting a possative spin on it.
---
This... people have been calling me an idiot here for saying it. Unless they add way more servers layering is here to stay. They kept telling me most people will quit and in a few weeks layering will be gone... and that blizzard said so. 
---
I don’t think they realise how few people will have to stay. There is like 2 pvp servers per region. To think layering is not here to stay is crazy to me.
---
Bro, where these onions come from.l all of a sudden...
---
It was a bit if a gyp, was temporarily excited for an earlier release!  I think you are right about layering
---
Because 15 years ago the number of players was estimated to increase over the years. Today it's estimated to drop off sharply within a few months.
---
You will find that a number of "reported trolls" in the wild are actually just people who disagree with something someone has said or are against a change. but because a lot of people can't see past the rose tinted glasses of classic nostalgia they just declare them to be trolls.
---
But agreed, real trolls should be weeded out but most will get bored and go back to retail
---
I was ready planning on rolling female Tauren hunter, this only solidifies my choice
---
 Darnassus of all places? You're a cruel one.
---
Developers think their "kill 5 rats" quests are so compelling that players are more eager to experience the content they created than they are to experience it with others.
---
Sorry Blizzard but I'd rather have to wait a second or team up with someone to kill those rats than get through it as soon as possible so I can move on to the "pick 5 mushrooms" quest.
---
I'm glad you asked so I don't sound stupid.
---
Blizzard needs to delete layering and have a fucking word with themselves.
---
&gt; Guys, was this in vanilla? 
---
thats the question i thought you were responding to, sry lol
---
He is also genuinely smart, but yes he does put on a show for Twitch. His "off-stage" persona is a lot more chill and you can find samples about it on his VLog channel at https://www.youtube.com/user/ZackRawrr
---
LFG was made global in a late vanilla patch but I think they made it disabled by default outside of major cities after it became extremely spammy on some servers.
---
&gt; Notorious mafia / cross faction collusion / open world pvp guild APES: Hearsay without source and possibly a trick to hide their true choice as people actively avoids them.
---
Cross faction collusion is against ToS in classic.
---
Way to just totally miss the point. Btw making friends is the literal essence of why Vanilla was good. 
---
Phasing/layering significantly reduces that aspect of the game, making it much less good. Now it will still be better than retail due to lack of LFG and cross-realm, but the current implementation of layering is actually very reminiscent of retail sharding..
---
Hunter easy to play is a misconception. If this would be the case, there would be no such thing as the huntard meme. The only reason hunter get called easy is because the leveling process is smoother in comparison to other classes. Groupplay, endgame rotation and micromanagement is more complicated than most other classes. The chance to accidently wipe your group is the highest in the game. Hunter as recommended starter class is imho a wide spread opinion that is taken over wrong.

---
and the classic facebook group (it's closed so i cant share the post): [https://www.facebook.com/groups/WoWClassicHU/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WoWClassicHU/)
---
You login to the game, pick your server, create your character(s).  You just can’t connect to the actual game world.
---
From what I'm taking yes. Log in choose your realm .. wait until they open up.. create character(s) log out
---
If only I could wipe my mind to remove all WoW knoweldge and start again like it was 2005 when walking in SW was an epic thing and everything was new and unknown.
---
&gt; but right now it's the start of phase 2 which is ~6 months 
---
Which, coincidentally, is said by you and not by Blizzard.
---
Blizzard has only stated that it has to be gone, at the latest, at the start of Phase 2. They haven't said anything about when or how it's going to go away.
---
You're essentially logging into the game and creating a character like normal and setting all the features (hair color, facial hair, face, skin color, etc..)
---
You just won't be able to actually enter the game on that character. Basically the servers will be up for people to connect to, but the world servers themselves will be down so that no one can enter the game on those newly created characters.
---
you'll be able to load the game like normal and create 3 characters total.
---
If I understood it right then you just log in, get up to character creation, make your toon and that's it.
---
Apparently the world server will be done which means you won't be able to log in.
---
It is highly likely to be the exact same process as making a character like you usually would but you just won’t be able to enter the game world with it.
---
Post this on the forums a couple of times a day, Blizzard will read it and most likely have to make a blue post.
---
He got himself a healbot.
---
Summer shave. Will regrow in the winter!
---
Yeah, just log in through the client and pick a server. I assume we’ll be able to create our characters but not log in.
---
Somebody repeatedly screaming 'CLASSIC FUCKING SUCKS, PROVE ME WRONG' in world chat every 10 seconds for 6 hours is not just 'something I dont like'. 
---
I'm more than happy to have constructive conversations and even debates in world chat. But when it's blatantly obvious that somebody just wants to annoy people, they don't need to be encouraged.
---
I don't know if there is any official word on it.
---
My guess is, you will be able to login to character creation to create your character but the world server will still be offline so you can't login to the game.
---
I played Nost and I played retail (classic), on launch and on expansion launches, Lags/business is far better than layering in every and any scenario.
---
Thanks for the reply. Will use your addon for sure when classic hits, shard counter or not. Still I think if you really want to make the ultimate warlock addon a shard counter really makes it the complete package.
---
All realms will lose players after a while, that was their premise. If they don't, then we won't need merges to begin with. If all servers were healthy population and every 10th server low population, then they would just leave the low populated ones for newcomers and mark the rest as high or full.
---
Says so right in his post.
---
I had a weird on in Westfall last night. Was clearing the cave at the North with another char, we'd just about cleared it and started to leave when all of a sudden everything was instantly alive again. It looks like we swapped layers, was super weird, luckily we survived the swarm of mobs and managed to fight our way back out, I'd of been super annoyed if we;d died though, as it would of been a pain to res and fight our way out.
---
That's all I'm saying. Real trolls that are just there to annoy people, need to be rooted out.
---
They’ve only said no layering past phase one, I think
---
Asmongold isn't as bad as some of his followers. Are you happy now?
---
Maybe I'm wrong for assuming that someone who believes race is the reason black people commit more crime hasn't critically thought about their beliefs much. Maybe that *is* a reasonable stance! Thanks man, I'll have to think about this more and do some research. (is the /s needed?)
---
"because you have none, you condemn anyone that doesn't tow your pathetic narrative with no facts."
---
Sure thing shapiro.
---
Amazing, right? That Blizzard have to consider that they will have thousands the times of concurrent players that private servers have? Who would have thought?
---
(Un)popular opinion: Talking non-english in public channels on english servers should be bannable.
---
People need to complain about something so it’s not a surprise. I played for about 20 hours and saw nothing wrong with layering or anything with layers. It’s prolly best to judge for yourself thou.
---
Thanks a lot mate. Got almost two months of game time unused. This would be great if I can get them back this way. Never knew this was a thing
---
Because they forsee the game having a huge surge in popularity on release and rapidly dying to a small but stable population and don't want to do serve merges
---
Not stupid at all mate. I started building the habit of working out in the morning and meal prepping healthy food before Classic.
---
I will be playing 3-5 hours a week after I finish work and I need to establish a healthy routine. It's awesome how Classic has inspired us to be better
---
There is no way I would choose any other server if we had a server named Eggplant.
---
I, for one, am really looking forward to play a dwarf priest. I would have gone for dwarf mage to recreate my old retail character if it was available,  but in the end race identity reigned supreme over class identity.
---
I guess I’m just lucky my preference also ends up being optimal race/class combo, but it bothers me if my choice would be regarded as such.
---
What I’m trying to say is that not every dwarf priest player is hostage to game mechanics. We are just enjoying most badass priest there is. That being said, there could be more vests in the game.
---
***&lt;Trouble&gt; [EU-Horde-PvP]*** is a community-driven, progression-focused, English-speaking raiding guild. We've been playing online games together for upwards of 15 years, and we've picked up a whole bunch of great players and good friends along the way. We have a wide array of players from all across Europe, and beyond, with varying different levels of experience. 
---
We have players who have reached high heights in both PvE and PvP across various expansions, but also others that have never even played vanilla WoW before. With this in mind, we are creating an inclusive guild where everyone is welcome, as long as they're enthusiastic and willing to play with us to the best of their ability.
---
***Leveling*** - 
---
There will be no rush to level 60. We will begin raids as soon as we have the force to do so, but if it takes you a couple of weeks longer than other people, nobody cares. You will probably be able to join the early birds once you get there. Take your time; enjoy the experience. 
---
***Raiding*** - 
---
We will be raiding two nights a week (all times are in **Server Time (CET)**):
---
**Sunday 8:00-11:30 PM** //
---
**Tuesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
Come Phase 3 (BWL), an additional raid night will be added to revisit older raid tiers:
---
**Wednesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
All participants are expected to bring their own consumables. You don't have to be doing top tier DPS/HPS, but you do need to respect the rest of the guild enough to bring what you need to be functional in a raid.
---
**Loot System** - 
---
Our loot system will be a very simple, closed bid DKP system with partial decay to help deter hoarding. Name a more iconic duo than loot council and drama.
---
When the third raid day is introduced in Phase 3 (BWL), it is worth noting that it will NOT use the DKP system, and all items will be rolled (main-spec priority, as usual) between raiders who want them. The reason for this is that a lot of people in the guild can only raid two days a week, tops, and they should not feel like they have to come to this raid in order to keep up on DKP for the main tier raids.
---
**Classes** - 
---
Like any other guild, we would prefer the dominant classes with meta specs. However, we do believe that the player comes above the class and spec in a lot of circumstances. If you're dedicated, positive and willing to listen, those things go an exceptionally long way.
---
With that in mind, we are willing to give most people a shot, with the caveat that those classes and specs with a generally weak performance may find it harder to earn a permanent raid spot. If you are very confident in your ability to play an off-meta spec that isn’t listed below to an acceptable level, feel free to contact us:
---
**Druid** - **CLOSED)** //
---
**Hunter** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Mage** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Priest** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Rogue** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Shaman** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Warlock** - **CLOSED** //
---
**Warrior** - **CLOSED**
---
**Classes that are closed are still welcome to join, but you probably won’t be able to raid with us unless/until we have a huge turnover of people.**
---
***Contact*** - 
---
We’d love to answer any questions you may have. The best way to contact us is by joining our Discord:
---
https://discord.gg/Wj2fMHP
---
You can also talk to an officer directly on Discord:
---
**JJ#5133, ianb#7738, Fugger#2372, blart blart blart#4655, Samszee#8393**
---
Or doing the same on Battle.net:
---

---
Thanks for your time!
---
^this
---
Just remember that you can't change your characters looks without deleting and remaking, and if you delete then that name is available to someone else until you make another character and try to claim the name again.
---
So you'll be rushing to make the best looking character you can as quickly as you can. Or you can just claim the name asap and then remake the character in a week once the rush has calmed down.
---
&gt; heavily
---
yea 1% less hit is truly game breaking
---
The higher settings the more load can be put on the GPU. Some effects will cause more load than others so it could be better to start with a lower quality preset (like mode 7) and then adjust individual settings manually if needed. On mod 7 my Vega 64 is pretty bored. 
---
**Also important thing:** set in-game frame limiter to the refresh rate of your display. If the GPU is pushing like 150-200FPS while using a 60Hz display then no wonder it's getting hot and loud.
---
Blaming players for wanting the authentic feeling? Blizz promised it. Now we get layering. GG
---
Can you show us any link or anything that says that the stress test layering is not how it will be like in live?
---
Blizzard has piss poor communication and we have to literally guess whether the stress test (on the live client btw not the beta client), is layered like live or beta. Furthermore, there is tons of layer hopping happening as you play the game, making it feel literally like sharding. I have been phased out of friends and co-questers several times. New mobs just zoning in, etc. And I wasn't joining or dropping groups (Which shouldn't even effect me as I only joined groups in my layer with others in the same layer). 
---
The experience felt very jarring to me and the world felt much more empty and disconnected. It is a huge immersion breaker to constantly be layered around.
---
So the "everyone loses" approach, got it.
---
[Something similar](https://m.imgur.com/a/CKThBZr)
---
NA - PVP or RPPVP - Horde preferred, but will play Alliance for the right group. 
---
Will be multi-boxing a druid and rogue to level, will play whichever is needed, and whatever spec is most needed.  
---
I'm a laid back adult with a family and full time work, I expect it to take me several months to ding 60.  Play times can be inconsistent.  I'm more interested in finding good people than anything else.  
---
My favorite things are pvp and stealth runs.
---
Your twitch name is the same as Reddit. Noticed you on a small streamer the other name.
---
That sounds vaguely passively threatening but you just have a bit of a memorable name lol
---
14 hours but I did run around a lot and did professions on the side and just wasted time in general :D
---
Battlegroups. They a thing?
---
I've played Tibia for 20 years which is full of Brazilians, Spanish speaking South Americans, Poles, swedes. A game with experience, equipment and skill loss at death. Where they "dominate" servers, closing of entire areas, killing you over and over again causing loss of 1-5 hours of grinding per kill.
---
They don't know English still i managed to play with and beside them. None force you to group up with people for other countries if you're a xenophobe
---
Well to anyone with basic reasoning skills they'll understand that your server is your world. But false equivalence is a cool tool when you don't have an actual argument.
---
naw that was fine, the ribs
---
Was this already confirmed? I thought deleted characters' names can't be reused for a set amount of days
---
I almost forgot about this shield with Abe on it, I love vanilla
---
Cool. Then why do you ask if the language barrier really is that big of a deal - only to then retreat to "that's just, like, your experience" when people explain to you why it in fact is?
---
Vanilla especially is about the social experience. You can ignore that for yourself, but you'll still find that a lot of people don't agree with you. And you can't *make* them play your way.
---
I mean, yeah. That's inevitably what toxic and divisive behavior leads to.
---
BGs are instanced areas. The world is not. In a 15v15 scenario it doesnt matter, but in a serverwide area like Stormwind / Ironforge or questing areas it does matter tbh.
---
Hey who wants to play with a community? Nothing better than not being able to take part in exciting events on your server! But thanks god you do not have to fight for mobs to kill from lvl 1 to 5.
---
Let me dig through the blue posts. It might be a hot minute since I'm at work.
---
[He did](https://m.imgur.com/a/CKThBZr)
---
Why don't they just communciate this. If the heavy layering will only last like 3 days (or a week) I would be fine. They can then cut to a much softer layering 2-4 layers for a few more weeks, before taking away layers completely. 
---
If I knew they would do this, then I would be very happy. Since I don't, I am here trying to get Blizzard to see the problems such heavy layering is having.
---
 I hate this behavior, its one of the things that upsets me the most! 
---
Someone says something stupid and/or mean, people don’t care to much and even laugh…nothing is said!
---
Someone says something stupid and/or mean, people get offended and turn on said someone…”Comon guys, I was joking…you know I didn’t mean it!”
---
To be fair, I think Asmon he is just being himself, trolling people and he doesn’t mean it…his whole twitch career feeds on drama! But as someone else said, there is a thing line between behaving like a moron and saying he was just behaving like that for lols.
---
Right.
---
But sorry this is not bettter. Because this garbage will persist for longer than a week or two
---
 **&lt;F I N A L L Y&gt; | Horde | NA PvP EAST | Thalnos (probably) | Raid: 7-11 EST weeknights**    
---
**About us:** We will be focused on raiding the endgame content as it comes out. We plan on being in MC within a month of launch day. We also plan to do guild battlegrounds events. We are most late 20's to early 30's, and we all have a good sense of humor; definitely a "Mature" guild. We are all very friendly, but if we find someone isn't, they probably won't be allowed to stick around too long. Right now we are looking at rolling on Thalnos, but ultimately we want to avoid the server the big streamers go to so that might change.   
---
**Looking for:** We need all classes and level of players. Ideally you have some experience with vanilla wow and know what you are getting into. Right now we have about 20 people who are planning on playing with us so we have some ground to cover before we have a SOLID raid group.   
---
**Raid Loot System:** We are going to use a DKP system. Our officers have deliberated the pros and cons to DKP vs Loot Council and other systems. We ultimately found that DKP will be the most fair system to all players. This system rewards the players who participate the most, and gives them control over which pieces of loot they receive. We have tried to find edge cases where this can be abused but we came up empty handed.    
---
**Raid Times**: We plan on raiding 7-11 on weeknights, most likely Tuesday, Thursday, Friday  
---

---
I am very worried with all these posts about layering causing the game to feel like a ghost town. I'm wondering how it will work on PvP servers where someone gets ganked, but others won't be able to see them to help. :(((
---
Is general chat layered too?
---
There are two (2) possible outcomes of this.
---
1. WoW classic remains insanely popular. Population does not decrease at all, it might even increase. Solution: Blizzard will open a lot more realms
---
2. WoW Classic, as projected, receives an initial surge of players that quickly drops off, leaving only a dedicated core of players that stick around long term. Solution: Remove layering, leaving a healthy amout of players per server on the initial servers launched.
---
Your scenario, scenario 3, is not going to happen.
---
Scenario 3: WoW Classic remains insanely popular, Blizzard don't open any more realms, don't remove layering and just keeps it as is. Not going to happen.
---
Strands* of grass...
---
In Grob we trust!
---
Lmao that's me
---
Not unless you delete and remake it (which I'm not sure is possible as the name might be reserved for a while after deletion) but I meant that you don't have to decide on your character's looks when the game is playable already - meaning you can decide on looks within losing precious playing time at release
---
I swear if I hear Anyone whine about layering again...
---
&gt; authentic vanilla wow experience
---
&gt;layering
---
Pick one
---
Your tool shows the wrong time for me.
---
Also: [https://www.iswowclassicout.com/](https://www.iswowclassicout.com/) is accurate
---
Yeah it was confirmed, [blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/reserve-your-name-in-wow-classic-on-august-12-at-3-00-p-m-pdt/242723/141).
---
Then UK should also be able to participate :)
---
I'll defend the concept and theory of layering quite happily.
---
Blizzard's implementation of it is horrendous and needs constant criticism.
---
Blizzard is reserving names for the big streamers
---
A question is whining?!
---
Oh no, if only it wasn't impossible to add more servers if it's needed :(
---
They’re the top DPS once geared properly for the entirety of vanilla.
---
This is just childish and pathetic. I thought most people on this sub were not only adults but 25+
---
I may be taking the wrong approach then. My energy level isn't what it was 15 years ago, so I was supposed to start Red bull and crack.
---
Considering you still got over 11 hours time isn’t of the essence lol
---
Short answer yes...
---
Long answer yeeeeeeeeeeees
---
By definition yes, totally agree. Stress test is prod environment!
---
Yup just s sub
---
Yeah actually I don’t think Esfand is big enough atm to really disrupt things. In fact he’s just big enough to make cool shit happen. Last night he helped one of my group mates complete the tower of althalaxx. Got a sick sword with like double the dps of a lvl 15 sword. Was tight.
---
it will because they're stubborn and only release a handful of servers. stack up 50 servers with the classic 3k concurrent player cap and it's not a problem. the percentage of tourists will be about the same on each server.

SO glad I'll be leveling warlock. Who needs Mana when you still have green mana left.
---
Shazzrah is the Spanish coalition server. Early rumours said golemagg but it's confirmed now.
---
Could change and I'm sure some Spanish will roll the "English" server though, only 2 choices after all so there will be a mix.
---
I think the BFA situation is a bit more nuanced but I would argue that it really didn't matter what the reality of playing BFA was like, people were going to hate it regardless. Class design for example. There were lots of classes that played better with BFA changes but it was never mentioned while shamans and shadow priest discussion overshadowed all other class discussion by a factor of ten on the official general forums because they were being used as examples of blizzards incompetence as that was the meta of discussion at the time. 
---
The point is that there is lots of overlap between the community calling layering the worst thing to happen in the history of all of human civilization and the doom and gloom crowd from BFA. It doesn't take a genius to draw parallels between the two situations and look back and see where the community might have been wrong.
---
No doubt about that. I'm brazilian and I'm avoiding them. Also, it is likely it will be quite unbalanced, such as Azralon. The horde player's majority on Thalnos seems inevitable.
---
Trolls would get stomped too, far away from a graveyard
---
I never really understood what people enjoy about shit like this, I'd 100% rather be fighting in small groups against small groups.
---
There seems very little to do other than spam an AoE ability, every time you see a screenshot like this half the people in it are AFK.
---
that's a really small gap imo...
---
in  two faction game being within ~5% of a perfect 50/50split is as good as it gets
---
Yes, it has. No one has ever in the history of WoW been banned for camping another player. Give me a break, PvPing is against the ToS. There's a server type for people who don't want to put themselves in that scenario, it's called PvE
---
Meanwhile in NA picking between steamers or people who don't speak english
---
Asmons reasoning was the most retarded thing ever. "The community hates me for being an obnoxious turd so I'm going to prove them right by being an obnoxious turd and not announcing cause they hate me."
---
Good contribution, thanks.
---
So if you're wrong and layering is removed by phase 2, you'll eat a shoe or something right?
---
Because layering through the hype is better than having a long server list with dead servers or hour-long queues.
---
People forget that one of the reasons why Blizz merged everything a few years ago was because there were so many dead servers after expansions and closing servers meant bad press for the game.
---
And don't forget to buff strangers.
---
That makes no sense, if anything it's the opposite. If it's a stress test and there no point in questing or levelling then people are more likely going to mess around the main cities?
---
nobody cares about events, what a stupid word.
---
Both servers will be healthy pop.
---
My friends and I are rolling Golemagg! Seems like all the tryhards and hardcore guilds are going Shazzrah.
---
I don’t think server-client architecture works that way. It could be if WoW had a terrible peer to peer architecture.

Hey hey hey!

Damn that's super fast. How can you get speed like this?
---
Less software running on my pc from companies I distrust.
---
&gt; It doesn't take a genius to draw parallels between the two situations and look back and see where the community might have been wrong.
---
So does that mean, looking back, you view BFA as an improvement over Legion?
---
You quit smoking pot AND quit drugs? Good job!
---
I feel like this word is so accepted as generic slang everywhere in the world minus North America
---
&gt; They're going to be sniped all day long
---
In before "special layer for streamers".
---
I'm rolling on a pvp server - you're definitely making me want to pick rogue!
---
Sharding will single handedly ruin the classic wow experience
---
Super hyped about classic but didn’t play a single stress test. Those are pointless. So I fail to see what this proves.
---
Welp, just keep an eye on your health IRL.
---
If it's like this for a week or two and then scaled down, im alright with it. I'd rather be able to play then have a crowded main city - That being said, it would definitely have to be scaled down afterwards, or else it would kill the game.
---
Esfand and Tipsout are the most fake people on twitch.
---
*weeps in classic*
---
Unless you're doing everything via VPN and Tor on software you wrote, it's silly to think you have any privacy at all online.
---
That's a relief!
---
Is that what you got from what I just wrote?
---
Yeah, he's not stupid, and he's actually one of the better people in the "youtube conservative" category, he has some really dumb opinions though. For example, he essentially boiled the "gender debate" to "2 genders lol."
---
He's much more tame than the people his undertone attracts.
---
My examples were a bit too extreme for him, even if he still fits the "youtube conservative" category
---
Your hypothetical is only bad for a select group of people in the unlikely senario that a streamer A) switches server and B) gets literally everyone to follow them with the server switch as they would have to abandon their progress in the old server.
---
You might get queues the first few days when they switch but it would quickly die down as streamer fans cannot play as many hours as a streamer and keep making new characters or affording character transfers.
---
Finally, Blizzard could limit char transfers if a server is being overpopulated, or can even turn off new character creation for a server. Sucks for people who want to follow a streamer but who cares.

Is this an Independance Day reference? lol

Shitty thread.  Use the search function.  Read the responses to any one of the 10,000 other posts discussing this exact topic as people’s opinions haven’t magically changed.

Please get off your high horse.
---
One example isn't enough to say that "Swedish is the most English scandinavian language". I can think of many counter examples.
---
Also, hungrig and hungry are only distantly related. Swedish didn't get it from English and English didn't get it from Swedish. 
---
And finally, Swedish also has a word related to "sulten": "svulten".
---
Source for Brits rolling on Shaz?
---
FYI - This clip is faked. His friend invited him into the group before the clip started. Him switching Layer occurred as a result of the group NOT due to zoning into Orgrimmar. He just timed it so that it looked that way.  
---
Its an example of someone trying to confuse people and incite hate over a system which is actually pretty decent. Similar to these "empty city" posts today.
---
Honestly the hardest part about raiding prior to naxx 40 is getting 40 people to show up on time and  prepared. 
---
An extensive study on recruitment and engagement strategies; building a core group that large and keeping everyone interested in progression and maintenance content is more critical to long term guild success then loot distribution. 
---
You can literally kill chromaggus every week for 3 months and never see a CTS, chromatically tempered sword, for your main rogues or warriors.
---
People are too impatient and can't wait 2 days for things to calm down and would rather ruin the servers forever
---
I watched them all and felt he was a bit harsh on Hunters  😂
---
You can change the first letters like pig benis and you should be fine
---
I've gained more Scandinavian friends than any other kinds since playing WoW (Blizz and private servers). By far the coolest bunch of people around.

# &amp;lt;Lionheart&amp;gt;
---
### [About Us]
---
Lionheart is a fresh, newly made guild seeking comrades for our Classic WoW adventure. Our goal is to clear Naxx without sacrificing a fun, laid-back community. We are serious about clearing the content and willing to do what it takes to accomplish that goal, but we're also here to meet friends and make memories. We are not aiming for server firsts, speed runs, or a high guild rank.
---
### [Raid Information]
---
As long as we're on track to clear the content while it's current and we're having fun, that's enough for us. We aren't interested in min-maxing beyond what is necessary to achieve our progression goals, and that is reflected in what we expect of our raiders.  Our raid times are from 6 PM to 9 PM PST (or 9 PM to 12 AM EST) on Friday, Sunday, and Tuesday. Friday and Sunday will be our main progression nights, while Tuesday will mainly be used to farm previous tiers.
---
### [Loot Policy]
---
Lionheart uses a Loot Council comprised of officers to hand out loot while seeking to be fair and keep the interests of the group in mind. The decisions will generally be based on five criteria: Performance, Effort, Attitude, Group Benefit, and Recent Loot. Raiders are free to ask for the reasoning behind a decision, and the council is to be as transparent as possible.  A general gearing strategy for progression in each raid will be decided before raiding starts, and players will be made aware of that strategy as well as the thinking behind it so that raiders can know what to expect during progression and why.
---
### [Member Expectations]
---
Lionheart is looking for players who share our goal of clearing all PVE content while keeping a friendly, close-knit community.  We want to focus on recruiting particularly like-minded players to form the backbone of our guild in these early stages. Our ideal member is friendly, reliable, competent, active, and willing to help others. For our raids, consistent attendance is required, as are basic consumables, but we are looking to avoid the use of world buffs and particularly expensive consumables (flasks) unless we find them truly necessary for progression. Specifics can be found on our website below.
---
### [What Now?]
---
If you're interested in a fun but competent crew to enjoy Classic with, make sure to check our website below for more information and either leave a post here, send a Discord DM to DeviousJinjo#9417, or apply on our site.  See you in game!

I'm not sure why but i feel people have forgotten its a test.. not a full release and they are probably still testing layering.
---
As someone who quit smoking in June, from daily smoking for years, no.
---
I'm not sleeping bad, just definitely a light sleeper now. And dreams man. Fuckin randomly super vivid realistic dreams where for years I just didn't dream.
---
Other than that tho, quitting has been no big deal.
---
I'm not in any of the Shazz discords, but if you throw me an invite to the one that's doing best I can join.
---
Right so why wouldn't you just go with a staggered merge of interconnected realms, Golemagg 1 through 4, merging 1&amp;2 and 3&amp;4 when their populations get low enough. This was would be conservative, better for the health of the game, and make it look like Blizzard for once knows what they are doing? 
---
NO no no instead we will just port our terrible sharding code from retail and slap it on classic, that couldn't possibly impact the players experience. 
---
Oh sorry layering and everyone seems to fail to realise its the exact same thing.
---
Right, but where did he say he wants people banned ?
---
GL. I feel like reddit might not be the best place to find like-minded people.
---
I thought the Spanish community were going for Golemagg?
---
You are saying that the "BFA doom and gloom" crowd were being unreasonable. In that case, you must think they were wrong and BFA actually wasn't a step back from Legion in most ways, yeah?
---
encouraged how?  like by making reddit "PSA"s that do nothing except give them attention?   Good work you've solved trolling by just telling everyone to ignore it!  genius!
---
It is interesting to see Horde population greater than Alliance on literally every PvP server.
---
Why do the scourge attack the Forsaken?  How do they distinguish them from living races? 
---
Surely it isn't "feral undead attack everyone" because they don't attack each other
---
If you create the look you want, then go back to the character select screen and delete the character with the name you want, when you go back to character creation the changes you made should still be there so you can just type the name and instantly accept.
---
I'm afraid that won't be possible. Modern macros can't make decisions for you.
---
You can create a macro like this:
---
 /castsequence reset=50 Battle Stance,Bloodrage,Intercept,16
---
However making the decision to press the button depending on how much rage you have has to be yours to make, not the game.
---
If you want to go a little further you can create a weakaura that gives you an alert when you have above 10 rage, are in battle or defensive stance and both bloodrage and intercept are off cooldown.
---
Yes it is :-) However its my my ingame name. Thats a secret :-)
---
Funny how both spain and scandinavia both aren't native english speakers yet are percieved completely different by the general public (myself included).
---
You reap what you sow.
---
Have always been in a guild filled with vikings and it looks like i'll be in a viking guild again this time. Thank god for scandinavians.
---
Playability &amp; player &gt; optics &amp; marketing.
---
This used to be the mantra of Blizzard. Make a fun game, fuck what the latest marketing says or the optics of the game look like.
---
God i hope a bunch of people steal their names. The tantrums will be hilarious.
---
You wanna be that delusional?  Go for it
---
You're getting off topic and your post history shows a lack of critical thinking so I will get back on topic and ask you this. 
---
What is the alternative to layering?
---
I reckon you know nothing about computers, so I’ll just leave it at that.
---
Thanks for this. Much appreciated!
---
"Blizzard polish"
---
same with you. i cannot even comprehend how little she actually understands when it comes to game. she can barely play mario.
---
I don't think you know what a bot is.
---
I just want to say I fucking appreciate you and genuinely hope amazing things happen to you. I plan on extensively looking into this because it may just be exactly what our guild has been looking for!
---
Really appreciate the work and effort put into this it looks amazing.
---
Silly Noob that's what Trade is for.
---
j/k
---
It is more regarding concerns that the game world was not designed to hold so many players. It was only crafted to sustain 2.5k players not 10/20/30/40/50k
---
I genuinely don't agree with that. I think the vast majority of people won't ever notice it. I think most people who do notice it won't care, and will simply move on playing.
---
Sure, there will be people who get upset, and there'll be bugs that get pushed to the top of this sub. People will spend a bunch of time raging here about how these bugs are going to make them quit. Those people were never going to play in the first place.
---
I’ll be the first to say I have no idea what you’re talking about, and googling it isn’t yielding any helpful results. Are you sure saturation is the right word?
---
No! Mage is much harder!

Theres only 1 really, this one has 6,000 members. The others have about 10-50 lol
---
Wait, what? People purchased bath water?
---
WTF?
---
Way to go man.
---
I’ve been trying to do the same thing - eating better, sleeping better, taking care of my body mind and soul. Also, I haven’t done any mushrooms for a month now just so im sure my tolerance will be nice and low for launch
---
Lol I can tell already this community is not going to be what I'm hoping for. 
---
I made the post to encourage a healthy community where people dont encourage others bad behaviours by responding to them. That's literally all I'm saying. So far all I've received is negativity.
---
Server transfer is totally fine for me. I just really dislike not knowing how long layering is going to last and also dislike the experience of playing with layering in the first place.
---
Even though I am OK with it for the few few weeks since it is a necessity, but beyond that, it should really just disappear. They can increase dynamic respawns if dropping layering creates a big problem.
---
As a Druid you’ll be able to do a lot of things at once. Some of that will be healing, some of that will be debuffing (Faerie Fire on rogues so they can’t vanish), some of that will be dealing damage (in any form) and some of that will be CC. 
---
Druids have so many tools that it would be silly to limit yourself to just staying in bear. You can’t burst like other classes can but as it sounds like you’re going to be in a group in WPvP that’s not a big deal. You have a lot of opportunity to out play people, for example nothing feels better than a clutch shift into bear followed by a feral charge (which roots and interrupts spell casting) followed by a Bash to stun then a shift out to war stomp and then an entangling roots. You can lock down a healer for a good amount of time which will give your friends time to either wail on them too or burst one of their team mates. Healing is much more fun in PvP than it is in PvE (imo) so don’t neglect that part of your kit.
---
My handful of friends and I are thinking Pyrewood Village on Alliance. Us being mostly 30+ don't have the same time to play these days and as much fun as PVP would be in Classic, the extra time it would add to most things seems like it would end up being a regret. So we plan on chilling on a normal server to start. What about yourself?
---
Its only an alpha
---
Its just beta
---
Its a stress test, duh
---
It just came out give it time
---
Woops, classic isnt so popular after all !
---
How tf did someone turn this into a 23 minute video literally just make a fucking pie chart or something lmao
---
would you wipe wow memory or all sexual memory? imagine getting to relive the excitement.
---
And you know that this bug was caused by layering because...?
---
&gt; Why don't they just communciate this.
---
I would imagine they are in a release crunch, this is only a "problem" for very (vocal) minority of the playerbase. And tbh, they have previously stated what their plan is, like in the blizzard panel linked here multiple times.
---
Tbh, im pretty fucking over with how players DEMAND things off game devs lately. They NEED to explain every decision, like we are in a democracy. We really arent. You can choose to play their game, buying it doesnt mean they OWE you anything.
---
&gt; you could already do free transfers without layering though. 
---
Blizzard are anticipating that the players will drop SIGNIFICANTLY to a few percent of what the launch day will be. This means that they'd either have to open a shitload of servers just for the launch that will be empty soon, or that you'd have 100k people in Durotar, and a crashed server.
---
They happened but were a total shit show and really hurt all servers involved.
---
The same discussion always boils down to layering vs server merges. Some people like one, some like the other, but the truth of the matter is the average classic consumer will be more likely to stay using layering.
---
layering in goldshire on the RP servers wont be taken lightly
---
Pretty much 100% of gaming scandinavians speak english fluently and happily engage in coversation. Meanwhile, Spaniars and other souther europeans will just: "*Que?*"
---
Im not talking about me specifically, i said "people like me". There are people who dont follow streamers and will accidentally end up on their realm. Those people just want to play the game normally.
---
Why would I have ever paid a single cent for subscription after TBC?
---
I don't think there is without using an add-on. It's the same for Paladin auras and Warrior stances if I recall correctly. You should look into add-ons anyway
---
when it was made global it was opt-in since it would be spammed more.
---
Ya
---
Except my opinion is clearly not the opinion of the majority of people on Reddit.
---
Because it is “designated Brazilian server”.
---
If you actually bothered to look at what gear shamans go for in phase 1 and 2 you'd know that this isn't an issue. It's not like they need Neltharions Tear to PvP.
---
Someone just sent me some memes inspired by my videos, made my day lol. My discord is AzAMOuS#7813 just incase you wanted to know. Cheers for the invite pal
---
It's not really an action bar; it's called the Stance bar. Quite a few classes have various "stances" that automatically go there for quick access. Like others have said, you can add the actually spell ability to another place on your bars through the spell book, but to remove the Stance bar entirely you'd need an add-on.
---
advice : to not search for advice.   
---
Explore , fail , enjoy ,   
---
Discovering wow is the best thing in this game. Don't get spoiled.
---
The fact that people choose to go to Spain isn’t because they like spanish people hahaha. It’s because its warm and cheap.
---
Isn't there also a hard limit of 50 players per "custom" channel?
---
Sure, and it's distruptive and probably labour intensive for Blizzard.
---
There is a GUI to remove auto handin in Interface Options -&gt; Addons -&gt; ClassicCodex
---
Min-max level thresholds were there in the pfQuest code, but since i didnt have a gui for them before, i left them at the default values Shagu used
---
Shift clicking on a quest's marker (little dots) should hide them. Report a bug if it doesnt.
---
I did auto-tracking in the past but WoW limits tracking to 3 quests so all it did was overwrite your previous quests tracked. Custom quest tracking would require UI work that I wont do before Classic releases
---
That solution is layering, are you retarded? That solution also completely fucks economies far worst than swapping layers for resources or STV arena chests. Do you really think the better alternative is to have people make characters, establish guilds, set up auctions, and do dungeons/quest together just to have to have entire servers facilitate a merge? You have to see how absulutely insane that is. 
---
This also proves my point, if they did what you are suggesting people would be absolutely furious. Look at how excited people were about just getting to name their characters, and you are seriously trying to argue that people would just be okay with having entire realms full of people forced to undergo realm transfers or server merges? Good lord. If you can't see the potential for backlash with that 0 iq take then you are lost. 
---
Oh, and btw, outside of the 1/1000 outlier situations of a possible laying issue moving your friends while you're in a fight, this is exactly what layering is, it's starting with multiple realms, just all under the same banner, with the stated intent to merge them when the population allows. 
---
And keeping with the theme of economy, swapping layers for herb nodes will do nothing to touch the impact that addons and out-of-game communication will have on it. People will be able to coordinate and communicate in ways never imaginable back in 2005 and advancements of addons will impact it in ways we probably can't even predict right now. 
---
Arguing that seeing an empty stormwind/ironforge for two weeks is worse than merging servers at some TBD date is borderline insane.
---
to be honest, I don't know what the hell I was doing that it took that long. It's just a data point. I was leveling with 3 friends, and it was our first game like that, and we got in right at launch in 2004. I think we spent a lot of time fucking around and doing dungeons and stuff. I remember walking back and forth between ironforge and stormwind a couple of times because I didn't know about the tram and didn't yet have the intervening flight paths...
---
This has been really interesting to follow. Thank you :)
---
Layers are Continent wide so bo they can't.
---
They will just secretly change it for sharding instead so they can use it zone wide.
---
We’re talking about a private server guild here, assuming you didn’t play on any of them was my assumption!
---
Pretty BOLD assumption there bud, got any facts or data you’re pulling that from? Or is it just neck beard intuition?
---
EU we have the same problem with people that dont speak english but the problem is the people who dont speak english have said they are rolling on both servers no one knows
---
Immediately. So be quick about making another char with the same name.
---
Is that Shadowed Unit Frames? If it is, can you link to a working copy? Tried installing it but never got the player frames to show up despite tweaking all the settings.
---
All of the errors that were reported were fixed so if you got the latest version, you should be good. Let me know if you find any within the next 4 hours
---
Will my old notebook run classic wow smoothly?
---
CPU: i5 4200H

 &lt;SALT MINERS&gt;
---
**ABOUT US**  
---
Salt Miners is a Progression / Semi-Hardcore guild for Classic created by a veteran group of players. Experience in Vanilla up to Saph, tons of PS experience, ranking pushes, mythic raiding and multiple gladiator titles after Vanilla. We are mainly a PvE focused guild but will likely have PvP related events throughout Classic’s life span. Leadership is a bunch of laid back 30+ year olds who are goal oriented, most of our members are mature individuals. Applicants under 25 years of age will be considered with the understanding that you will be working with an older crowd. We want to kill bosses and have a great time doing it, we aren’t here to babysit or micromanage anyone. You take care of your stuff and we will take care of the raids.
---
**GOALS**  
---
We are setting our sights on having our first raid night 4 weeks after launch. Our overall goal for Classic is to clear all content available. All raids will be conducted and driven by efficiency.
---
**RAID SCHEDULE**  
---
Tuesday / Wednesday 6-9pm PST, 9-12am EST, with optional raid on Saturdays for old / farm content.
---
**LOOT**  
---
Loot will be distributed by a 5 man loot council. Determinations on loot will be made based on attendance, performance, guild presence, attitude, and reward density.
---
**Attendance** \- This is the number one thing you can do to guarantee you get your items. If you show up to every raid, on time, with your consumes, and a proper spec, I guarantee we will take care of you.
---
**Performance** \- This is pretty standard stuff. If you are killing it we are going to get you the tools you need to do your thing.
---
**Guild Presence** \- Here are some things that I would include in this aspect; helping people get their pre-bis items, running optional raids, attending guild events, spying for world bosses. It’s literally everything you do OUTSIDE the raid that helps the guild. We take note of all that and your contributions wont be forgotten.
---
**Attitude** \- Nobody likes a debbie downer and nobody likes side cliques where you have people trash talking half the raid. While we know that there is no way you are going to get 40 people in the same room without some personality clashes, we expect everyone to act like adults. People that are good at setting aside their differences and working as a team will be rewarded.
---
**Reward Density** \- We understand that you aren’t going to want to raid for 3 months before you see your first piece of gear just because you don’t have quite as much time to invest as Joe Schmoe. We are going to spread the love around while making sure key players get key items.
---
**EXPECTATIONS**  
---
Attendance  
---
Attendance
---
We don’t want to recruit a large bench. Be on time or let us know before hand if you will be late or gone that night.
---
We expect the majority of our raiders to be 60 by week 2, but the sooner the better. It’s not a hard cutoff, we just want people stepping into MC with most of their pre-raid bis items. We aren’t saying there is going to be no meme-specs in the guild, but they will be very limited(likely less than 3) and unless we are aware of your intentions before hand you will be expected to show up with your standard raid spec. **Edit:** We are not currently accepting anymore meme specs. Very talented and strong applicants playing off meta will still be considered, but expect your application to be met with scrutiny.
---
We are looking for people who understand progression raiding and don’t need me or anyone else to constantly inspect you or check your buff bar. Self accountability is a big deal.
---
People who start side discords or chat channels with the sole purpose of bad mouthing other guildies will be removed and there will be no warning for this process at all. If you are making the raid unfun for people because you have an excessively negative attitude, you like calling out people’s mistakes, or you just generally are being a turd we will attempt to work with you to curb this stuff, but at the end of the day you are expected to be a pleasant person to raid with.
---
Please note there is a difference between friendly banter or competitiveness and being an Ahole. We banter with eachother all the time and crack jokes. Just make sure it’s all in good fun. It’s just as important to have thick skin as it is to be pleasant to others.
---
I emphasize complete and total transparency with leadership. You can expect to come to me for any problems you have for any reason and it will be taken seriously.
---
**RAID NEEDS**  
---
We started recruiting with the goal of getting 20 strong core raiders before the launch of the game. We have already exceeded this goal and are continuing to recruit serious applicants before and after launch. Any holes in our roster once Classic launches will be filled by people on the server, but we are looking to complete our roster before server launch.
---
Current class demand:  
---
Druid: Low  
---
Hunter: Medium  
---
Mage: Low  
---
Priest: **High**  
---
Rogue: low  
---
Shaman: Low  
---
Warlock: Medium  
---
Fury Warrior: **High**  
---
Tank: Low
---
No rolls / classes are entirely closed as of right now. All strong applicants will be considered. Raid slots are merit based. Just because your class is in low demand doesn’t mean you can’t be invited to compete for a raid spot.

They also said sharding would ever only be used in extremely congested areas.
---
Now it's used when more than 10 people are in the same area.
---
If that's the case, Blizzard needs to be way more clear with communicating this kind of things to us. Why are they intentionally making everything look like a shitshow?
---
I highly recommend UI addon to make the interface fit perfectly for you. Personally, I'm using bartender. Here's the link. You have to pick 1.13.2 game version of it

---
Your so lucky you were in the right layer/shard
---
You're right, you guys are something else.

Sorry, but no can do. Those dots are the reason this addon exists and itd be a lot of work just to toggle them off when they're a critical part of this addon.
---
Sorry :S

För Svea rike
---
This stuff happened all the time without streamers.
---
Oh wow that's interesting. So an add-on like shadowed unit frames should work from retail then?
---
I don't see any reason it should be treated differently than any other PvP
---
This is super interesting. I am also going NE sub rogue, so this comforts me.
---
Do you have/know of a decent pickpocket guide? With loot tables for the various "level brackets"?
---
I just tried it on Test and that didn't work unfortunately, looks like it all starts over again, shame.
---
They can't afford more servers and layering is the crappy solution
---
yeah. old servers were crap. special events often resulted in disconnects, lag and complete server crashes (like the AQ opening)

In every thread there's always a new excuse for layering:  
---
1. It's not like sharding and a totally different system, don't worry!  
---
2. It's just for phase 1, don't worry!  
---
3. You won't even notice it, don't worry!  
---
4. It's like this on purpose because it's beta and they're just testing...don't worry!  
---
I've seen this happen over and over and over and over again with game releases. Beta happens, shit's fucked up, and people still defend company X because "it's just beta, it'll be different/better/will have more content at release, you'll see!" Then the game comes out and it's in the same shitty state that it was in the beta 2 weeks prior to release. If layering really isn't this bad in the full release, I'll happily eat my words, but judging by what has happened with almost any other beta test that happened 2 weeks before launch, nothing meaningful will change.
---
Confirmed mad.
---
yep!
---
it's fine in the starting areas, up to level 10, maybe exclude the quest hub in the zone, so you can find people to play with)
---
I don't blame Blizzard. I mean.. did you ever had Fair trade organization knocking on your door, because of player complaints that they are unable to play only because you have a good game, but shit servers?
---
I support their decision. 
---
As for the benefit of doubt. I feel like having layering in the 1st phase is vastly superiour to not having classic.
---
Tbh, nobody in their right mind would setup their guilds information this way, if it wasnt under their own control. I would much rather use very crude, home made, not so pretty tables that i control over this. Any day of the week and twice on sunday.
---
&gt; you could already do free transfers without layering though.
---
You could, but if you have 100 servers that are all low pop you'll end up with maybe 20 servers that have healthy populations and the rest will be extremely empty which will result in horrible experiences to those that don't want to leave and Blizzard can never ever remove those servers because there will always be characters left on them.
---
That doesn't look good either. If you're moving into a new neighborhood and most of the houses are abandoned you'll start to think that something is wrong :)
---
Psychologically it's very different being offered a transfer off a full server to an empty one than the other way around, at least in my opinion.
---
UC elevators always looked dangerous to me, so I used em with caution. No deaths so far.
---
Play what you want, take your time, enjoy the scenery.  The game is about the journey, not destination.
---
Also just ran into this:  [https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/521/610/9c0.jpg](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/521/610/9c0.jpg)

human hunter LUL
---
Excuse me, to us Finnish people it is "munakoiso"
---
Source? AFAIK in retail it's bound to your account for a fair bit after you delete a character.
---
Way better than the battle of Winterfell
---
Play whatever your heart desire. The leveling progression will be your guide, from two spells to 30, from being ganked to ganking back, from running RFC or Deadmines to Onyxia, from begging for gold to wiping your bottocks with gold, from dropping mara scepter when clearing bags to getting scarab lord, from learning what ress sicknes is to remembering to repair before raids, from missing a quest item in the opposite side of the world to remembering cloak for nef. Will you break down crying when for the fifth week in a row you don't receive any raid loot? Your journey begins here.
---
Anyways, dw about it, hf.
---
Danskjävel! Pølse!
---
Just remember to disable "Shift-mouse wheel UP/down" hotkey in interface options, under action bar settings to make use of "Shift" modifier in mouse wheel macros without headaches. 
---
Normally this is the hotkey for scrolling through main action bar.
---
&gt; The test felt VERY good, you had competition for mobs, but it wasnt retardedly camped.
---
That's not my experience
---
we were like 150 people in the undead starting zone and every single mob spawn point had 3-5 people standing around, plus individual people running around randomly hitting things.
---
i took me hours to reach level 5 and leave the starting area
---
My guild wants to roll on PvE.  I am *terrible* at PvP but I want to roll on PvP anyways, because some of the most epic fun I had was on PvP vanilla in huge faction battles in the world zones.  It's mostly chaos, but with half decent impromptu organization, even if you suck, you can still enjoy it.
---
Sure, getting ganked in STV when you are solo by a group of 5 sucks, but it's just not that much of an annoyance that it detracts from the overall fun.
---
I think main guilds gone shazzrah, some Spanish gone golem to avoid other Spaniards.
---
oshit u right, nevermind, get pissed
---
You 2 have obviously never played on a fresh pserver.
---
I have the same feeling in every game I play but with French people. I don't understand why certain people from these countries doesn't want or try to communicate on the language that most of us understand.
---
Or what is more likely: it isn't profitable anymore.
---
I wouldn't bother -- the advantage of not doing it is that you get the full mystery/new-experience in the better version of the game.
---
One thing that would help is if you have some friends to play with -- any chance your significant other or brother or something wants to play?
---
If not, you'll meet people in game and it probably doesn't matter. But it's nice if you can swing it.
---
Perfectly legal
---
My guild did a transfer like that and it was the best decision we could've made. Our realm of Bladefist was both horribly unstable and packed with people resulting in massive queues, moving to a new realm and meeting new people and making new rivalries was a very positive experience.
---
&gt; BGs
---
They come out in Phase 3. World PvP with layering is gonna suck.
---
Right click, there is an option at the bottom, expand it “unlock frame”
---
Jesus, just looking at the Server Demographic Survey, theyre REALLY going to need more PvP realms. It always surprised me that Blizzard always seemed to consider PvE and PvP servers equally, when it always seemed clear PvP was more popular, which is further supported by pservers.
---
EU Eng especially needs some servers. If they want a stable 2500 pop on peak hours for servers, over 3300 people answering on a *survey* that theyre going to roll on Golemagg, and over 4600 on Shazzrah. I really doubt this survey is casting that wide of a net and is probably at best representing like 10% of what the initial population will be.
---
We can assume the other language servers will also have a decent population even from this because most of those other language speakers probably arent bothering with an english survey.
---
So you prefer to use your money in a cheaper country full of people that you hate, instead of going on vacation somewhere else, where people is nice.  
---
Amazing.
---
Since classic is using the updated client, there is no addon for this needed. Just right click the portaits and 'unlock' and drag to whatever position you want them in.
---
Danmark? Menar du Syd-Sverige?
---
Im gonna need lots of weed and beer to cope with the layering bullshit.
---
This stress test was extended through the weekend. Most people played the first 24 hours of which  originally would have been the entire test.
---
No problem!
---
Sure mate...  
---
dont hate on me for not liking your humor !
---
To be fair to FF14 the latest xpac just dropped, and because of how the progression is if everyone was on the same map everyone would get stuck.
---
Of course it shouldnt be punished. If they decide to stream where they're at all the time it's their decision.
---
Oh I used LFG all the time for grouping. And I know lots of other people did too. From my days trying to get the Alli Ony attunement done, the phrase "LF1M Jailbreak need tank" still haunts me.
---
Good thing it was already stated it wouldn't be. 
---
I'm threatening to quit if you don't do the thing that is already planned! Super mature.
---
Thanks bigredditorman, agreed with you agreeing with me.
---
damn I was going to choose thalnos too
---
My first vanilla character was a female tauren hunter, friends always bullied me when my tardy siluette came over the horizon. But damn my rohk'delar was big.
---
&gt;which is super expensive when you are level below level 10
---
Not to mention impossible, because it requires level 10 anyways.
---
Thanks I guess
---
As a french looking for a multinational PvP server the opposite is also quite true: will 2 PvP servers only for english and the rest of Europe (outside of GER + RUS) will be enough ? I'm tempted to go to the PvP french server just to avoid queue.
---
Agree.
---
[Nope](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/reserve-your-name-in-wow-classic-on-august-12-at-3-00-p-m-pdt/242723/141).
---
Lolol! Thank you for the comic!
---
I absolutely loved playing this stress test and its good to see so many others who did aswell.
---
Cool, we are getting Vanilla wow, im super hyped.
---
«Streamsniping», lmao, if you’re stupid enough to broadcast your location, you deserve whatever you get.
---
Keep it up [Richturpin](https://m.youtube.com/user/juddyy/videos) !
---
Nobody. Everyone that has speed leveled on Blizz-like private servers AoE Grinded and just quested. At some points mages can grind instances solo but it's not for the exp, more for gold.
---
Lol this was the exact same in wildstar.
---
The Baguette is really the icing on top lol
---
I’m not sure it’s working as intended. There are dead layers with no npcs at all and people in groups are being layered from each other.
---
Makes sense, thanks for your reply!
---
You know end gear warriors are top tier when they tank in fury for aggro generation.
---
It's possible they deliberately made it aggressive over the weekend to see it in action more. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
and then people wonder why soda wants to blacklist people...
---
The best solution is to remove it entirely. Yes that brings risk of server death and long Qs, but as the blizzard of old would agree with, gameplay first. The sadly more realistic thing to ask for though is a better balance between server count and layers so the issues can minimised. I don’t know how in the world a region of a million ish players are gonna fit on 10 servers with layers of 3-5k.. will be so many layers. Had always hoped they would shoot for maybe double or triple the normal player count vanilla had, in total with all layers that is.
---
A lot of those addons don't work tho
---
Very nice
---
Exactly.
---
I'm no fan of streamers, but lets not pretend that someone wants the name "Asmongold" for any reason other than to troll a popular streamer.
---
I have no problem at all with Blizzard letting them get their names early, because all it does is annoys petty dickheads.
---
Comment je donne une médaille pour mon bon vieux poto français
---
Funniest shit ever, I'm very sure the people ganking streamers do not give a single shit about being blacklisted from your guild 'The Brown Nosed Alliance'.
---
Vous n'êtes pas prêt!
---
If there wasn't even a South American server created, I think it's realistic to assume the English speaking NA population will vastly outnumber the Brazilian population.
---
It probably won't be a big issue, if you seek out an English speaking guild you won't have to worry about it too much. 
---
Maybe you'll have some encounters in the world with a communication barrier but we've been dealing with that for years on private servers.
---
because trolls like attention, and guess what.  This post is giving them attention.  As you said:
---
 "Somebody repeatedly screaming 'CLASSIC FUCKING SUCKS, PROVE ME WRONG' in world chat every 10 seconds for 6 hours is not just 'something I dont like'."
---
Guess what, they now know they were successful, they agitated you, they annoyed you, they pissed you off enough to make this post.   Your day was affected by their actions.   If you just ignored them from the get go, and went about your day unbothered, then they lose, and your day is better because of it.
---
Lol. Joy in WoW classic. I will have none of it. It's almost like people forgot the pain.
---
A couple issues with that.  For one, it would force name changes due to duplicate names.  Also, blizz has been slow in the past about dealing with over and underpopulated servers.
---
Yep, but it remains to be seen to what degree that will be enforced. Same with streamers. If I was to bet, I'd bet on them getting a pass with most stuff that fringes on or breaks with the ToS. Remains to be seen tho.
---
&gt;Requires rank 10 or higher to speak
---
If only this was the case in bg's also xD
---
That wasnt real TBC btw, that was a project 70 run. Hence.. what.. like 10 people killing Illidan? And the squished stats on the Glaive.
---
Hearing this make me happy beyond belief.
---
I included it because I thought it was hilarious.
---
Isn't the big Spanish community going Shazzrah?
---
And I see Hungarians are goin Golemagg, which community is 'worse' ?
---
Well, I've argued with so many stupid people that even if they drag me down to their level. I drag them down one more level and beat them with my experience.
---
The picture is just proof to where you said "I can't speak to him about early name reservation." I never knew nor have seen any proof of him wanting people banned
---
My point is for some item you will see only one per month. With 10 times more players, you will see it 10 times more often at different price so even if 10 times more players also need it you can afford to wait, can afford to not talk to the seller to try to negotiate etc...

I I think we mean the same thing just said it differently. Right when servers were announced everyone and their mother tried to make an official server Discord. That role in particular is very dangerous in the wrong hands. That is why I am staying away from server discords for the foreseeable future. If there is a way for people to abuse a system they will find a way.

Which horde starting zone is quickest to level?
---
It was.
---
Well, our grasp of british grammar leaves a lot to be desired. American has no real standardised grammar so they do not count. Also, we tend to use way too many commas.
---
I took no offense, sorry if I made it sound that way. I'm saying you're wrong. Do you have any source that Swedish is more similar to English, other than anecdotes?
---
And in which way are you measuring similarity? Pronounciation? Vocabulary? Grammar? What I'm trying to get across is that it's very difficult to measure similarity between languages, especially since Swedish, Danish and Norwegian are so closely related to each other.
---
Much harder on the player side too
---
Let them have their names, let them stick out like a sore thumb. 0
---
Just FYI, you can choose a name now, delete that character at release, and choose whatever class you want then.  No one is going to take your name in the minute it takes you to pick your class and arrange your look.
---
Ion said in a couple of interviews that it's gonna be gone by Phase 2 because of world bosses and whatnot. My guess is they'll remove it but if they don't add more realms we'll have pretty hefty queues.
---
They don't pay the same price, thats the point. They earn Blizzard thousands of extra $$.
---
Equal rights doesnt count for a damn thing here, this isnt a fictional utopia; this is paid access to a multi million dollar product you are complaining about, and are feigning outrage over something that doesnt affect you in the slightest.
---
Its is a gesture of respect to people who promote their product that has zero negative impact on the community. There is no downside for Blizzard.
---
I don't have the ability to make new friends on Grobbulus, though.
---
Do we even know for sure if there will be servers on east coast? Several of the eastern time zone servers on Live are physically located in the west coast data center.
---
According to the [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ae2yEz0mpS8W09_Zjm17zjzAAFrAZyxyJU9fvpYwqw/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true) it's pretty much 50/50 of scandinavians between the two pvp servers. Or was this before the decision and people who signed up for golemagg on the survey will choose Shazzrah now?
---
That’s not even trolling imo tho, that’s just dumb obnoxious spam. Trolling is more a special kind of unappreciated banter. It’s such a void word in any case, never really took on a definitive meaning.
---
It's generally ok as long as like 80%+ speak english (ideally more but still).
---
&gt;This was never said by anyone at Blizzard.
---
What the fuck Ion said "we promise we'll remove it in a few weeks"
---
I  playedoriginal vanilla, played nost/ely and had more fun than I did back in the day, being older. Playing through the stress test was just the same. No idea where this fear talk of "it won't be the same" comes from. I do not know how many times we have to teach you this lesson lel.  
---
"gamers.. have changed"  
---
No offense anon from one boomer to another, this sounds like some delusional, odd, boomer talk. Gamers, games, do not change. We're not some weird dna evolving species. If a game is good, people play. The opposite is going to happen of what you said.  
---
"Many of us are going to revel in it, but vastly more are going to wander off, and find something better to do."  
---
I have a feeling the complete opposite is going to happen. The net is going to catch more people and keep them, then let the ones slip away.  You sound like every Marvel movie trailer ever made.  
---
THE WORLD.... HAS CHANGED....IT'S... DIFFERENT... NOW...  
---
(I'm joking, but I genuinely believe people are looking too much into this.) WoW Classic is fantastic back then, and it's fantastic today, nothing changes that.
---
keep the people speculating and talking about them is more important than doing anything that decreases drama and makes people settled with a topic
---
I second this, looks absolutely great however it's slightly sketchy having to use a public email to gain access to this sheet... As above, would it be possible to direct message you to get our own copy?

Who is also a streamer. The irony.

---
Did you play the same class you usually play in retail? What did you think of the abilities and combat in the stress test?
---
why do they all want on the same server?
---
FRESH
---
yep cant wait to watch the guys who have been playing 1.12 for 10 years absolutely shit on all the snowflake streamers. "blacklist" lmfao
---
Fairbanks Link is Expired
---
You prob mean localdefense
---
It should not be punished.  Even if it was punishable it's bear impossible to prove.
---
I vaguely remember sodapoppin getting someone banned for it though.  Did that happen?  Maybe it was just him crying and saying it would happen.
---
Actually you're just spouting BS. There were MANY different pservers. Several had tweaks on purpose, some were poorly implement, but several were also very close to the original.
---
For me personally it is not so much what I am playing it is who I am playing with.
---
A lot of my old WoW buddies are getting back together to play. (Including some IRL friends that I have lost touch with).
---
I pronounce it the same as "Aberdeen". Just pretend its full of Scots for extra lols.
---
Judging the whole community over one guys msg xD the hero we need
---
Im out of the loop, why is streamer choosing a server important? I tried to figured out trough reading comments, but i have no idea.
---
Dude...the graphics are _insane_. Im running 1440p with the render scale at 200% and holy shit, its so beautiful. I mean..even Barrens was good looking. Mulgore was incredible
---
Nah the problem is City appear empty but when you do a /who you can see there are tons of people actually in the city but you just can't see them.
---
With layering you retain a loose but constant connection to the other players in your ream. If reals are merged, you'l find yourself clashing with an entirely new community. Mergin isn't better, in fact, its much worse.
---
Layering differs from sharding because sharding occurs on a zone to zone basis while layering affects the entire continent you're on. Its the same technology and system but layering makes it so that you don't see players poping in and out of existence while running from zone to zone.
---
Check the sticky in this subreddit. Same link is in my linked video's description.
---
Streaming allows their fanboiz to locate and follow/help/defend them.
---
So I think it's only fair that we can use their stream to gank them
---
Part of the vanilla feel is a big open world. If you cram 5-10x the amount of people into the world than it was designed for, it will feel small and claustrophobic.
---
Meh, like someone else is gonna come up with some weird name like Thex...
---
The problem with server merging is twofold. One is server identity and cohesion it is very vanilla to just merge servers. The most memorable way was free server transfers off of overpopulated servers. The second problem is names you might not be able to keep your name your guild name or your friends names together. And layering will be a minimal issue for a small period of time and then it is gone
---
That’s one of my biggest worries.
---
This.100%.

Cringe

cant play without the joint in my mouse hand, cheers to you.

**\[H\]\[PVE\] &lt;Silver Tryhards&gt; Recruiting for Morning Raid**
---
Silver Tryhards is a Horde morning raiding guild that also welcomes casual players.  We value the social aspect of the game above all else.  Our top priority is to attract friendly people.  We will be playing on a PVE server and our goal is to have about 50 core raiders.
---
We will use a DKP loot system that will reward people who contribute to the guild.  Legendaries will be distributed via loot council.
---
Right now, we have openings for one rogue, one mage, two hunters, one holy priest, two resto druids, and two resto shaman.

They can only decide to play on one

Norway is with the Americans, dont invite them!
---
Kinda annoyed about this myself tbh, the server types and locations are announced, what the fuck are they waiting for.
---
Should it be punished? No
---
Will it be? Probably not- but maybe if it gets to a point that Blizzard considers it *harassment*.

"disingenuously pushing PC things"
---
How is a robot (or character) being gay disingenuous? How is a robot (or character) being straight not disingenuous by that logic?
---
Also convenient post lol
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/cp4hhd/quarterpounder_caught_once_again_acting_like_a/
---
"just pay for necessities lol" "straight is normal, gay is different and political" Oh yeah, I'm being disingenuous for UN-RIGHTFULLY assuming this guy is a conservative. My bad for misrepresenting him. (is the /s needed?)
---
If he said "hey, maybe gender can be a flexible thing while still maintaining specific definitions for medical and research purposes." I'd say that's a liberal opinion, complaining about non-binary characters isn't a liberal opinion.
---
As for that first paragraph, you have no reason to believe that's my thought process. An opinion can't really be wrong, however it can be "bad" (everything is subjective, but let's not get into meta philosophy).
---
I'm not saying conservative opinions, by virtue of being a conservative opinion, are inherently bad, I'm saying *these* conservative opinions are bad.
---
For example, your argument in that first paragraph is straight out the "youtube conservative" manifesto, not only is it wrong about what I think, it's wrong about what I've said.
---
1. So you don't really care about keeping a consistent community, since you are willing to dump together 4 or 5 realms a few months in. You care more about seeing Org and stormwind looking like pserver screenshots on the day of launch? Got it. So you don't care about server community at all.
---
2. There are literally thousands of hours of streamed content from the stress test. The "disappearance" of people before your eyes is a major outlier and is something that won't be permanent. The issue of finding out someone not being in your layer is preferable to not being able to speak to them at all until four months down the road when they are forced to name change and merge realms. All of these issues in your second paragraph are temporary and and specifically early rush problems and are a pittance compared to having to uproot and entire guild/change your name. The economy will be massively in flux for months, and the number of layers will drastically reduce, even the doomsayers have agreed with as much, if you think layer swapping during the first two weeks to get mining nodes is a threat to the economy then I'm not sure what to tell you.
---
3. The devilsaur "mafias" on pservers with 24/7 watch and rotation groups and Tradeskillmaster. EZ. These things did not exist on the majority of realms in classic and the former is made much more accessible by things like discord and the latter is a literal application that tracks every single item and price on the realm. You seem to spend a lot of time here, have you not payed attention to the leaks from streamer guilds sharing their intent and plans to monopolize entire servers using these tools and resources?
---
Either way, you seem to just be larping because there is no way any sensible person thinks mandatory merging is better than seeing an underpopulated-looking stormwind or Org for a week.
---
Thats why my proposal would have many more (smaller) servers, with populations of around 3 k like in vanilla.
---
As i understand in classic they wont be so eager.
---
On retail they will intervene alot frequently and protect the victim mentallity people.
---
I wish I would have been alone in Sen'Jin.
---
Competition for those tigers was fierce.
---
Exactly, still they are not employed by blizzard therefore don’t have any extra privileged, it’s their choice to do free advertisement, in the end they pay $13 and I do the same to play the same game.
---
I couldn’t care less about your NA drama, i also don’t care about any names but I understand some internet warriors can’t stop raging if they don’t get their names. 
---
I also don’t have any problem with blizzard reserving streamer names, but demanding it is a bit too much.
---
Herod the people's choice
---
You're an idiot.
---
So you chose a shit private server. Your point is?
---
That’s probably the best three in a row I’ve seen. They all work so well together, even the last one.
---
Yeah...just wait till TBc attunement then...
---
Realm vs realm is part of my nostalgia
---
I think a lot of these issues are because blizzard is "forcing" layering during the test at random times.
---
Having played on a PS a month or so ago with full classic hype and the classic test this weekend, I can say that 1) yes, zones felt a little more empty, which is sad, but 2) I could actually complete quests I couldn't complete on the PS without some real frustration.
---
Take Fenix's equipment in the Dwarf/Gnome starting area. On a PS, you basically can't complete it as 15 people are sitting in a semi-circle with a long respawn timer. Sure, the quest isn't critical, so you can just skip it, but conversely, doing any of the kobold mine quests in human areas were just incredibly painful, even in groups. I literally sat in one spot and just tagged the mob that would spawn there over 30 minutes to get the kills I need.
---
That isn't necessarily fun, but neither is the feeling of an empty world. So that makes it tough.
---
We'll see how layering goes and we'll see when they strip it back. It is not easy to balance the feeling of large, populated worlds and the ability for people to be able to play and have fun.
---
Correct. Not to mention that if he happens to be right blizzard has just created huge, inorganic, queues that wouldn't exist if people had medium pop realms to choose from the get go.
---
If you have a mate in Disc or TS you should be able to reserve each others names, take all the time u want and have ur mate delete the character the moment u hit that enter button.
---
That doesn’t matter, it’s just pathetic to go through someone’s post history to see if they’re from a certain sub. It’s irrelevant to the discussion and does nothing.
---
Meh, it still takes 6 minutes to run there. A six minute mile is considered pretty quick by most standards, so say its a mile from Bloodhoof Village to ThunderBluff - on a clear day, there's no reason you wouldn't be able to see the lifts, especially with how high in the air they are.
---
Seeing the scout tower of the Crossroads long before you can see anything else is pretty cool. Bigger viewing distance adds to the immersion imo.
---
Layering is trash. You saw .25% of the people you should have. I don't care if it was earier to level. This is supposed to be a Vanilla experience. You are being cheated.
---
Typical bait and switch. This is an absolute joke. Blizzard needs to remove this garbage. 
---
Layering/Sharding is going to DESTROY the community feeling of classic. Total let down Blizz!
---
The dancing troll village, a secret area that is only accessible via some wall jumps in Winterspring.
---
If Blizzard's predictions are close to reality and they remove layering as/when promised I won't mind layering at all. 
---
But if they underestimate the player numbers I'm not a huge fan of the opening of new servers post launch, allthough it's the only choice at that point.
---
It's honestly astounding how much Cata managed to make the world look worse.
---
If you go to the blue post on the classic forums it tells you. Also, its the exact same time the game goes live in your region.
---
I DID have fun with people like me who had no idea wtf to do lol, it did seem to work
---
Too bad, I will be. :)
---
Odd. I was in ORC/Troll area, that should have at least the same amount of players. Tbh i took me like 15minutes to get in after launch, had to clear out a nearly 12000 queue. 
---
Maybe undead is more cancer. Tauren area must be so easy then :)
---
I'm not going to be bothered about layering because it's only temporary. We just have to weather the storm early on and then we don't have to worry about it ever again.
---
I mean this picture is taken out of a stress test. Granted, a lot of people played it but you can’t expect IF to be packed. Karanos, goldshire - XR now they are full. But you’re still right, layering needs to be removed.
---
Me, I just don't want to play on a streamers server that's my only requirement (besides PVE :) ). I'd rather play on a dead server with no streamers than a full pop streamer cesspool
---
Given the choices of 2 guild arch-types which would you rather be part of?
---
+ A guild based on a loot train (and driven by the acquisition of loot)
---
+ A guild based on friendships/inter-personal relationships
---
Most players generally wouldn't be playing classic if they weren't in it for the long haul and once you realise that there's no point in 'racing' to obtain loot. If we simply wanted the reward of ever increasing powerful gear we'd just play BFA (which hands out loot like candy). That generally leaves (as reasons to play)
---
+ Because we enjoy the gameplay
---
+ Because we enjoy the people
---
Casual guilds will fully be capable of clearing Nax, and fundamentally 'Casual/Hardcore' isn't something defined by how many hours to commit to a game, but how much time/effort you try to cram into the time that you spend.
---
Do you have an example of these "a lot" of addons? Tried them on the last stress test?
---
This isn't the beta with select invites. The popular streamers will have a 50+ fanboys guarding them at all times.
---
Poor mage forgot his ice armor and his dampen magic.
---
Not that it would have made a difference, but still.
---
I have a theory that not all of them necessarily do, however I get the picture they have more planned events like the dueling comps and the only way to facilitate that is to be on the same realm
---
Those not on curse are very few. Not sure who wants to manually download addons nowadays. The hardcore ppl that use the non-curse addons already know where to get them anyway.
---
If it's disabled in cities, vendors that sell limited quantity stuff will be much sooner out of stock and thus certain recipies will be much more expensive.
---
Apart from that, I don't think the system supports disabling layering for just certain areas of the continent.
---
Spell batching is set to the same value as in 1.12, meaning it's not too slow or too fast if the intention is to replicate 1.12.
---
Look I get there's a point when it could cross the threshold into harassing...
---
...but when they're talking shit about how they're gonna get their legions of zoomer cultists to mass report you and how you're totally gonna be blacklisted and UR DONE KIDDO, they're literally asking for it.
---
Strength in numbers? Plus some of them do like playing together.
---
I thought it started at 3pm PDT? Wouldn’t that be like 6 edt?
---
No no it’s not the advertisement that like ppl care about, it’s all of the special privileges that streamers are asking for and stuff, that makes it really enjoyable for us to watch this god destroy those streamer guilds
---
Omg that’s not what he meant. If classic goes live at 5pm central time on the 26th for you then character creation is 5pm central time on the 12th. Its the same time for you both times.
---
Yes there is, in the dwarven district.
---
No and you clearly didn't read what I said, because I don't agree with or like the Quartering but your mislabeling of him is wrong.
---
And lots of people have the opinion it is disingenuous when a corporation tries to force sexuality into things (Like robots, which aren't even sexual by nature) for the sake of marketing, and if you don't think it's for the sake of marketing, you are being naive.
---
And I do have reason to believe you think conservative arguments are inherently bad, case in point: "The quartering isn't conservative when he gets triggered at apex legends characters not being straight?" Here you directly associate being conservative with being a homophobe, which isn't even a true account of what he said, not to mention the other associations you made, like internet conservatives being man children and so on, as in your first comment.
---
So your not wrong is assuming he might be conservative, but the entire air of your comments and argument are absurdly partisan and you sound like a professional spin doctor for buzzfeed.
---
Yeah that's where all my horde charcters were (Alliance looked dull), but after they made Sylvanas go apeshit and I found Zandalar to be a chore i 110 boosted an alliance and had much more fun on another server
---
Log in and create your character like normal.
---
i dont understand why it has to be in the cities though...
---
&gt; This is just more German self-loathing, self-flagellation and inferiority complex.
---
What the fuck are u talking about
---
&gt; Also, from my time playing Vanilla WoW on PServers, I'd say most the truly stupid and toxic shit in world chat came distinctly not from German players.
---
our experiences differ that fine, but if u are german and bring up things like "self flagellation" chances are u belong to those 70%, at which point u wouldnt know the things i described because ur doing them
---
I didn't encounter any issues with spell batching, but I found vendoring trash and moving things around on the UI (hotbars from spellbook etc) to be laggy.
---
I did damn near every combination of my character that I could until I got him just right. I probably logged in and out in rapid succession probably 30 times. And then I did like two quests and quit. I want this to be as fresh as possible for me.
---
see this is fine point to move you around you are not in combat you are entering a new area so it is more of a transistionary place and when you go back you stay in that layer so it apprently needed.
---
the issue with sharding is you can consistantly jump from 1 to 2 back to 1 by taking a step so things spawn in and out and it is really frustraiting. and then you have things like group up will send you to an other shard even tho both people are right next to eachother.
---
but the core issue we have seen with layering and sharding is swaping in combat that is simply not okey as it will kill you in classic.
---
cata made the world less beautiful, but also classic has a better graphics option than vanilla did, so you combine those two things and we get the best version of warcraft to date
---
\^ this is what I'm scared of.
---
Hm. I really dislike the nitpicky nature of complaints about what doesn't work in Classic. But after watching multiple videos about that one I think it might be ... problematic.
---
While I like layering or sharding or whatever as a concept it also has to be used properly to work. It doesn't seem like Blizzard got that memo.
---
Realy? My Bad 😆
---
Because the expansion dropped a month ago and it's their way of making sure the zones don't get overly congested while people run through it. It'll be removed in a few weeks time. It happens every expansion. And spoiler alert, even if the zones weren't instanced currently the only meaningful interaction you're gonna have with anyone while leveling is doing a FATE.
---
You could use it to detect some common Spanish words that are not used in English.
---
I'm Dutch and I hate when people refuse to speak the common tongue (English) ingame/online.
---
Québécois are pretty common on my retail server and it's w/e, they're not toxic or really a problem, they just like to talk in French. I'm tired of EU players forgetting that NA servers encapsulate more people than your average American.
---
pass the word along to join /lfg early and if people get used to it and actually find groups it will catch on.  
---
Back in the day we used to send one person to a capital and one person to the barrens to spam.  Kinda weird to see people looking for BRD in barrens but thats what people would do
---
And in the past for vanilla when they have done this it's easy on communities because they have a choice it's stay on an overpopulated server or go to a new server with all of your friends. The choice I feel like matters instead of forcing people to merge onto another server
---
Interesting that rogue is so high. Most polls had rogues pretty low on the charts.
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
Pvp was always treated like a minigame. There's still plenty of people playing the map meta events, raids, fractals, etc. Pvp was just always dead since they release expansions that clearly had 0 thought put into the pvp
---
Streamers already have their names reserved I bet
---
Hm? You can designate the order of buffs and debuffs in the current version of CT Buffmod for Classic? Or just make an additional bar? Did you try the current version because your problems seem to already be solved.
---
There's no reason to believe that people who spend their time trying to follow streamers would be well emough equipped to fend off a guild of people who are dedicating themselves to killing streamers
---
Fuck me that'll be annoying
---
Fuck asmongold though, hes an egotistical prick that pretends to be bad at things just to get views
---
i dont understand why they need layering in the cities. i guess if they changed that it would be sharding? 
---
i just really dont want to walk into stormwind or IF and find 1 lonely person jumping around whilst i know there is another layer with a bunch of people selling stuff and showing off their cool gear! even beggers... i would rather have someone come up to me and beg in a funny way than be in an empty layer.
---
Everyone disliked that ^
---
This is Luna downloaded from here:
---
https://github.com/Aviana/LunaUnitFrames
---
Tarantino's face always gets me
---
&gt;So you don't really care about keeping a consistent community, since you are willing to dump together 4 or 5 realms a few months in. You care more about seeing Org and stormwind looking like pserver screenshots on the day of launch? Got it. So you don't care about server community at all.
---
What are you on about man? Why don't you argue with me instead of whatever strawman you've decided to construct? The reality of the situation is that realm pops will go down as tourists filter out, and a solution is needed to this. I prefer a solution that gives everyone as good of an experience as possible until the realities of the realm population demands a solution. You apparently prefer a solution that leads to everyone playing some kind of franken-vanilla until however many months (or years?) have passed for the concurrent player count on NA servers to fall below Age of Empires on steam lmao. With 10 servers you won't be averaging less than 5k concurrent on each PVP server for a long, long time.
---
&gt;There are literally thousands of hours of streamed content from the stress test. The "disappearance" of people before your eyes is a major outlier and is something that won't be permanent. 
---
Why would I need to watch streams for evidence when I've leveled to 15 4 times in the last few days and seen it for myself plenty?
---
&gt;The issue of finding out someone not being in your layer is preferable to not being able to speak to them at all until four months down the road when they are forced to name change and merge realms.
---
Dead wrong. Trying to play with a friend? They already rolled on your server, so you're in the same world. Meeting new people?  You know if you are talking to someone, you are playing with them. You're in the same world. There's no lack of people to interact with, each server is the size of a vanilla wow server.
---
&gt;they are forced to name change
---
No one would be forced to name change, if you were actually arguing with me and not some strawman you've constructed you'd have read that.
---
&gt;specifically early rush problems
---
Avoiding ganks is an early rush problem? Farming Black Lotus is an early rush problem? Layer hopping for rare spawns is an early rush problem? Going to gank some alliance raid heading to BRM and discovering you're on the wrong layer is an early rush problem? Do you even read what you type?
---
&gt;uproot and entire guild/change your name
---
There you go again, the only problem you can find with server mergers is people having to change their name, which a shared name pool completely avoids.
---
&gt;The devilsaur "mafias" on pservers with 24/7 watch
---
Do you think that horde/alliance guilds didn't work together for mutual benefit in vanilla? Did you play vanilla?
---
&gt;Tradeskillmaster
---
Do you think AH addons didn't exist in vanilla?
---
&gt;Either way, you seem to just be larping because there is no way any sensible person thinks mandatory merging is better than seeing an underpopulated-looking stormwind or Org for a week.
---
There you go again, dramatically misrepresenting the entire issue. I guess you're either the type to fanatically defend blizzard to the end regardless of the reality in front of you or just trolling. Looking forward to you rabidly defending whatever awful changes 9.0 makes next year.
---
If you do join world chat, you should make an entirely different chat panel just for world chat to tab in and out of. World chat shoots all other chat messages away, so keep it out of guild/raid/party panels.
---
I’m not sure about this since I frequently played on unofficial servers and thus am very familiar with Vanilla, but remember that most players haven’t played this since 2006. If it had been over 10 years since I played the game the last thing I would do would be messing around in major cities like I do in Retail. I’d be out there grinding mobs and doing the old quests.
---
I was so hyped for wow classic, until I realized that it isn't going to be anything like wow classic. From what I've seen of streamers plowing through dungeons with 5 mages or just the general shitshow that streamers are going to bring to the game in general. You know who I am talking about, a certain no-upper-lipped streamer for one who will have 100's if not 1000's of gnomes following him around and donating untold resources. 
---
world firsts will mean nothing. 
---
The huge nerfs to damage and health of elites and seemingly all mobs. 
---
Everyone already knows the meta's and everything has already been spreadsheet accounted and min-maxed to death so if you aren't using that stuff you won't get anywhere.
---
Back when WoW first came out, the internet was a vastly different place. There was no such thing as memes. Trolling wasn't 'cool' yet. And everyone was on Dialup. 
---
Layering??? LoL. How is that going to effect an Azuregos attempt? 
---
Anyone who played in the long long ago remembers graveyard zerging that shit and the pvp fuckfest that it was. That won't be possible with layering. 
---
What about world pvp, if you are chasing someone down and griefing them - which is a part of wow - they can just layer hop and cya and do their quest. 
---
I can go on and on but this isn't WoW classic. This is WoW Re-Imagined and polished. I'm surprised there isn't an in game cash shop accessible through the auction house to buy skins and pets etc. It's just not going to be what a lot of people are hoping. And the fun you are seeing streamers have is not going to reflect your own experience. 
---
I still want to be hopeful, but with release in 2 weeks, I don't see it being what a lot of people are expecting it to be and the population will die off extremely fast, especially with the shit ton of other awesome stuff coming out before the end of the year.
---
This is how you kill a game. Make bad changes people don't want and when there is a community backlash call it "whining" and ignore them. A few months later you end up wondering where people have gone. Turns out that "whining" was actually valid criticism. It's important to listen to the community. Look at what OSRS does with polling every update for example.
---
Warden is not smarter than the developers. There will be plenty of bots in classic, they will just be private and almost non detectable. Some of them use mesh-detection on the screen which apparently should be hard for warden to detect if the bot is not mainstream.
---
You're right, I have no good reason to claim that Swedish is more similar. It seems I'm just basing this on selective memory and pronounciation. I thought I was onto something here.
---
Il give it a try
---
Alex is always right
---
Tbh letting streamers register their names before others will make it harder for anyone to pretend they're a famous streamer just because they have a character named after them. So, less scams and such.
---
I think my solution passes, no? They all coordinate on a server of around 3k players. If the server dies it gets merged with another server which also propbably died off.
---
In my head its layering without layers if that makes sense. In this way keeping the hard borders between servers while still managing populations mid/long term.
---
Give them early name reservations. Who cares? It's not like I need their names.
---
No chat addons, it's the following command to re-enable class colors:
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
Why promote a IRL scammer?
---
Yea. Literally the only thing you need to do if you don't like streamers is to ignore them and their fans/followers. This whole blacklist thing is a non-issue that will only have effect on people who are a part of streamers and their following. Basing your classic experience on not only ganking but greifing people is just a waste of time
---
He wasn't referring to Scandinavians with "don't speak English" lol.... he meant the Spaniards.
---
All Scandinavians speak fluent English.
---
Wait! Is it out to play now?
---
Does it really matter if they get their name? Asmon could literally click a random name and most of the people interested in him will know it that week.
---
I'll name my character Buttmouth before I demand blizz give me preferential treatment
---
Do you know why I’m still downloading add ons from that site but when I go in game it says that the add on is out of date?
---
They said no layering past phase one. It's a little longer than a few weeks but it's the same basic premise. Used for launch and then removed before the world bosses and world content that it requires no layering. By then characters will be spread out instead of all in the starting zones. I do hope they remove it sooner but we will see.
---
Everyone plays with the same people, but also then a whooooole bunch of other people they've never seen before. 
---
You can't "solve" the layering problem with servers merges because that's literally one of the problems they're trying to solve with layering, it's the opposite.
---
They already are, might as well be consistent.
---
This makes zero sense. It will take all but a few seconds to /who him and figure it out.....
---
I dont think so, all this will do is cause drama and excitement for their streams
---
Not during vanilla. In TBC a hunter soloed Azuregos with +healing gear.
---
looking for guild with hot asian girls
---
We'll have to see. Even if they are undergeared and underleveled, Asmon can pull in a couple hundred fanboys easy.
---
Or I was curious as to why people didnt like steamers? Thank god this sub has enough decency to downvote people like you. 
---
God some people are so insecure
---
I disagree. While your main premise is correct that a lot of players end game spend time in instances content, a lot of that content still revolves around the economy. A packed endgame makes gold acquisition near impossible.
---
hate to burst your bubble but the guy with the mace that can do nothing but auto attack, and completely lacks any gap closer, will most certainly die if you are shooting him in the face.
---
I have no idea why people in this sub are so upset about streamers.
---
And Swedish word for it.
---
Yeah Spanish are going Shazzrah, but me and my English guild and friends are going Shazzrah. I have no data or anything to back up my claim but I feel like Shazzrah will be more active just based on what I've heard. Don't mind grouping with some Spanish people they're chill.
---
The argument has NeVER been that layering is the ideal, the argument has always been that layering is better than server merges and the like down the road. Having valid criticisms is fine when also presenting alternate solutions, pointing out bugs is fine, no stop bitching about the same things over and over again when it’s not going to change gets fucking annoying. Layering is here, it’s not goin anywhere at this point
---
I tried stuff I had back in vanilla/bc and that is listed in with that filter: bartender, Grid, Parrot..
---
I can give you a proper list later tonight when I'll use my pc (I'm on vacation so it's off the top of my head)
---
The streamers themselves aren't usually the problem, some are nice enough players and some are toxic. The issue is their fanbases, the streamers will be constantly followed by a large group of people with obnoxious behavior and a rabid need to get the streamer's attention as well as harass or bully anyone who could even be thought of as a threat to the streamer in any way.
---
Yet, in the starting zones everyone is standing on top of each other, trying to get first hit on mobs.... I think it will be just fine...
---
Log in, pick server, create character
---
Stonard.
---
~~fight~~ slaughter
---
Rain in any zone makes it look amazing
---
Even with lower thresholds it still doesn't work as advertised. We were told it would be CONTINENT WIDE and PERSISTENT. I.e. walking into stormwind should NEVER phase you, no matter the thresholds. I think it's you who doesn't know how layering works (or basic logic for that matter.)
---
Ah that was what i was thinking of yes, thought it was during vanilla sorry :p
---
Dude this sub whines about literally everything. Even when they were proven wrong about their pservers they were complaining that they FELT right.
---
Another user commented and said they can MASS report people. Which will get them temp banned.  
---
Thoughts on this?
---
No I will not stop bitching about it,  and if it ruins the game in the way I expect it will, I will have no interest in playing classic, I’ll just play the next private server. 
---
If enough people make enough noise, there’s the possibility that blizzard changes it.  But if we sit quietly and take it like little bitches then we’re gonna end up with permanent sharding and wow tokens in classic.
---
Yes they have. My brother got banned for camping someone specifically for a few hours/days. He got a 3 day.
---
Agreed, especially as a warrior. Unless this he was duo leveling with a friend or something. I'd be curious as to what race as well...
---
That sound better than 2 hour long queues
---
I really don’t see the issue with that. Who would want the names asmongold, sodapoppin etc. besides people who want to mess with them? In the grand scheme of things it doesn’t seem like a big deal.
---
Yeah I agree, thanks for this response. I’ll probably enjoy making my own guild with my few irl friends and growing the guild as we play the game.
---
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The Rogue doesn't know he's not MT tonight.
---
Is there a command like that for enemy health bars?
---
Ok but you distribute non layered server loads with lower population parameters, so isn’t it much of a muchness?
---
&gt; I prefer a solution that gives everyone as good of an experience as possible until the realities of the realm population demands a solution.
---
And you think the best solution is a massive realm shakeup at X date in the future? What about the community? That is just ridiculous and so incredibly shortsighted. 
---
&gt;Farming Black Lotus is an early rush problem?
---
If the servers are so populated that this is an issue with farming end-game mats why wouldn't them opening up new servers be preferable? Rather than having blizz just jump and and say, "Grats, you're now on a realm with 2x the population that you've been playing with for years and guess what? The realm you merged with was 80% of the opposite faction and will control black lotus and the devilsaur farm now :) 
---
Your shortsightedness is literally insane. 
---
&gt;Do you think AH addons didn't exist in vanilla?
---
Compared to what we will have in two weeks it's like comparing an abacus to excel.
---
simple question - why can't we put it on or off. If we have it off, we will all be on the "accual server" and if we set it to on we're on the "layering method" (each change should give a resitricion, like a payment in gold that doubles or 1day cooldown that doubles) and to avoid it being abused all layer on users will always be layered to the off user if grouped up.   
---
noone can complain cause everyone can decide "I use it or don't want to use it"
---
good video, for a more succinct video (15m long encompassing all classes with very good info), i recommend Kargoz class guide [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4)
---
It will absolutely destroy classic, you're about 7 years ahead of the posted minimum requirements.
---
I dont think having that many people will stop a few rogues from jumping someone when they are on half hp and have agro. People said they will just do dungeons but there is still alot of travel between dungeons if you dont have people there summoning (Lets be real though none of them are going to have to run anywhere because their lackeys will summon them)
---
he's not hiding behind it tho. it's fairly obvious for anyone who isn't tilted beyond reason like half of this sub.
---
Cata really did. Vanilla I feel had a simple understated beauty. Cata they added a lot more “exciting and interesting” stuff. That ended up looking a bit trashy. For example the big vortex in Darkshore or the big Goblin battle in Stone talon. And all the goblin mess in Azhara.
---
Wow it's weird to see people upset with layering, when two months ago any shit talk on layering was downvoted and insulted. I guess better late than never, but it seems to late for any real change.
---
&gt;If you are streaming you are announcing where you are and if you are on a pvp server there are ramifications to letting the opposite faction know where and when you will be somewhere.
---
Yes but none is streaming just so the opposite faction can see where you are. The point of streaming has never been about announcing your position. It is just a unavoidable side affect of streaming online MMO games. Trust me most streamers would be happy to remain "anonymous" while streaming so none could see where they were even friendly players, but that just isn't a posssibility. I'm not arguging that streamsniping should be bannable, of course it shouldn't. But streamsniping is essentially a more easily accessed wide audience version of screen-watching on a local MP game. If you streamsnipe as a friend or foe, you are that kid that can't win in goldeneye without watching your opponents screen.
---
I would argue this is due to the bias that Blizzard has showed it over the last few expansions. People who never played Classic don't understand pros and cons of each faction and are just going with what is cool on retail.
---
You'll still need to purchase the base game of world of Warcraft if you do not have an account already. but like everyone else has said, after that you'll only need a subscription to play once you have the base game, BFA not required.
---
That system is no better than layering.
---
I keep saying it but combing economies and social groups that have never interacted before is just as intrusive and un-vanilla as layering.
---
that's besides the point
---
EU - Alliance (but will probably make a Horde too) - Hydraxian Waterlords but maybe Auberdine - Probably a druid or hunter, first. 
---
Mostly just looking for people to play with; don't care about the speed or skill. I'm very much a completionist so I level slowly anyway, plus I have very sporadic times due caring for children. Avid RPer - both in game and story writing. I'm usually leveling multiple characters so I might be on a different one given the day. Just don't be rude; LGBTQ friendly players preferred. &lt;3 
---
Posting in here since there are very few IC guilds so far. I play mostly night elves and humans (though I want to try an undead girl this time since I've never done Horde).
---
Holy shit, good one.
---
Yeah, I can see how you feel that way.
---
Peace.
---
Bro, won't anybody who has interest or concern in the streamer know thier name, just by looking in thier stream.
---
Wasen't it Asmon who publicly told his viewers, that he would destroy any server with his army, and no one could do anything, basicly?
---
And then the kids will be placed in foster care because both parents are wow addicts :D
---
Perkele!

that's his type of humor. it's why he's so easy to take out of context and people accuse him of stirring drama all the time.
---
Wasn’t the world first 60 a rogue?
---
I don't know if it's a technical limitation, but merging is easier on a realm to handle. With layering, you're still all on the same server. Same auction house, same people, same guilds. If X item costs Y on the AH before layer merging, itll cost Y after layer merging (unless the price naturally fluctuates in that time). 
---
With realm merging, that's not the case. You're mat costs could be insanely different from realm to realm. It could work in your favor, or it could hinder you. It would be terrible to save up mats to be able to buy your mount, then suddenly be in a server where they're going for 1/2 the price, and mats you need are going for double. 
---
Reserved a name you really wanted? Well, now you have to change it, because someone already has it on the server you're merging into. Same with guild names. Layering isn't the best solution, but it allows for a more streamlined transition versus merging a realm.
---
Asmons reasoning was the most retarded thing ever.

"I'm shocked, shocked, that there's gambling in this establishment..."

Can't shift click away quests. Mod will always think it's Christmas and want me to pick up the Festive Quest. :(
---
Not many big streamers in Europe that would have an impact on the server.
---
i believe you, it still was the predicament of this comment chain
---
But how is more servers to pick from in the beginning, knowing that your server could end up dead once the tourists leave, preferable?
---
It seems to me like you're proposing a choice between many servers with no layers where you acknowledge yourself that some will end up with populations so low that they'll need to be merged and a smaller number of servers with layers where the layers merge when the populations lower.
---
How the latter doesn't immediately strike you as the better choice to give everyone as good of an experience as possible, I really don't know.
---
My god this would suck.
---
I will gladly take 3 weeks of layering over this idea.
---
Can 2h arms actually do dps in pve?
---
I dont think this is going to be a problem outside of the first few weeks of launch.
---
Yes, it did. As a result of a high initial population that gradually increased, as opposed to a massive initial population that sharply decreases at first.

---
No worries, my initial comment wasn't very well tought through.
---
I will say as a wow vet it shocks me people still tolerate a queue in the first place; I cant think of another game with a paid subscription no less that forces me to wait during peak hours.
---
I went there twice and hated it both times :) much prefer France, Italy or Greece:)

"Warning: Contains Radioactive Waste"
---
Lol please please please just let them not roll on whitemane
---
 And then the kids will be placed in foster care because both parents are wow addicts :D
---
I dont have a source for you but blizzard has officially stated that it will be implemented for a short period of time (first week or so).
---
In the best case scenario the population drop will happen in the first two weeks. Which means that most merge would happen there. Economies aren't formed yet and social groups are still forming.
---
Evidently the population cap of each layer was also significantly reduced for the stress test or something.
---
&gt; If you are british
---
It's funny how you're trying to refute his statement by making the exact same statement towards another country. Moron.
---
So start merging after 2 weeks. It is really hard to pair servers when you consider faction balance on the merged servers.
---
As an EvE Online player... I'm a little proud.
---
Yup definitely eating your words right now. Look at this subreddit right now in disarray over layering
---
So regular players can avoid them if they'd like.
---
Just a heads up. Australian normal raid times are at 5am EST NA. I don't know if that fits in with you at all.

Ah yes go to the Free still not a vanilla experience, don’t play classic if it bothers you this much, the rest of us don’t really care if you do or don’t we just have time to waste talking to you while we wait.
---
Damn, does the levels stick?
---
Well yeah, just because you're playing by yourself and don't see problems doesn't mean they don't exist. People that played with friends noticed problems, people that went to major cities barely saw people in them (even though the /who list was filled with people in Orgrimmar), etc etc. Now it COULD just be the stress test being changed and modified LIVE which causes the problems for players, but Blizzard kept completely silent through all of this which makes it less likely to be the case.
---
There's obviously some major bugs with the layering system OR it's intentional by Blizzard because they will remove layering after phase 1 and don't see any reasons to change it. Which is a problem in itself if that's the case if you ask me, the first phase is just as important as the other phases since that's the phase where the entire community will shape and take form.
---
I don't have a problem with layering being in classic for the first phase, but there's a lot of people coming back and if their experience with classic is empty major cities and mobs randomly disappearing they might end up not enjoying classic as much as they would have otherwise... and that's a problem. Keep in mind that phase 1 might be active for 3, 4 or even 5 months for all we know.
---
As a spanish player, in my experience there's a rather big amount of toxic spanish players in most games I play.
---
If you haven't noticed until now, I got bad news for you buddy.
---
Explain why maybe ?
---
Has a twink server been discussed in any capacity?
---
Didn't blizzard already confirm they've reserved some of the big names' account names? Ones that were invited to the closed beta?
---
Name reservation is the least of our worries. I just want to know where they're going so I can avoid them.
---
I didn’t personally encounter any issues forming groups or anything, but the lack of people in the capital cities was definitely a bummer. 
---
Now maybe everyone was out and about leveling but felt like every time I was in Stormwind there were about 10 people in Trade District. Busy cities were what first made my jaw drop when I played vanilla, hope that continues.
---
You should add each other on bnet and be support buddy’s to keep your efforts going strong.
---
I'm not convinced.
---
I have a related question - but didn't want to start a whole new post.  If I create a place-holder character as fast as I can with random physical attributes (for the sake of expedience), will I be able to go back later after the name reservation rush to delete that character be more deliberate about the appearance?
---
I seem to recall something about a character name being locked for a period of time after character deletion.  Years ago I deleted a character, and tried to remake it immediately with the same name but different attributes but was locked out on a naming cooldown.  Am I misremembering something?
---
It's amazing what you can do and afford when you don't do that shit.
---
ganking someone that will get ressed immediatly because you didn't wipe their followers isn't really much of a hindrance. Tagging mobs and farming ressources around him on a PvE server would do more harm than that
---
My prediction on how this goes:
---
1. There's a massive sub boost that gives blizzard/activision the subscriber numbers they need to show for EOY.  it'll show lots of new subs and returning which investors love.   Servers will fill up quickly but they won't expand too much to keep servers at high population.  Blizzard will start spinning some more up as folks complain of leveling times and streamer server bombing.
---
2. after a month or so, most players who started  post wotlk/cata and thought checking out vanilla would be cool, will get frustrated w/ the slow pace and there will be complaints about how Classic is broken... 
---
3.  as a result lots will either unsub or out of frustration come crawling back to 8.2 to give it a shot and begrudgingly play it for a month or 2 (what blizz is really hoping for)
---
4. At Blizzcon, they will tease something big coming....   omg, omg omg omg madness.
---
5. Blizz will then likely offer some type of end of year discounts in an attempt to keep the frustrated classic players and even more frustrated  returning 8.2 players subscribed into Q1 just in time for a leak or further reveal that aforementioned surprise, the next big expansion that will blow everything else away... Unicraft, a universe after the world of warcraft.  it will feature a new  subscription service called Stwarblocraft Swarm, a discounted way of owning all non-overwatch blizzard games wrapped into one subscription.  There will also now be  an all new wow -survival mode where you have to harvest resources to survive and build shelter within the cruel post apocalyptic world after the world of warcraft where pvp'ers can take gear from their kills. 
---
who knows re: number 5, but the rest might be pretty accurate.
---
Ah yes, comparing lvl 15 capped stress test Ironforge to a server with many many lvl 60s on it. I don't see any reasaon why people would hang out in Ironforge on the lvl 15 stress test other than some streamer being there at the time and the viewers flocking the streamer.
---
Because “QQ my name” and “QQ game is dying”. Mergers would be the intelligent thing to do but people would make a ruckus.
---
Speaking for the Danes: We are by far the most sarcastic bunch around... The Swedes are polite. If you see a Dane being polite to someone/you, assume it is sarcasm :/
---
Are you sure about that? I'm wondering too but I haven't been able to find any official information about it.
---

---
You're dreaming if you think they have enough data to accurately merge servers after 2 weeks. It'd be months.
---
See - now at least you get upvotes :) people are beginning to sharpen their pitch forks for launch - but until then it hopefully quiets down a bit with all the QQ :d
---
Right... that's why we knew they were going to muck it up for like a year now, as soon as Ion said they were doing sharding. They had what they needed to release another Nostalrius years ago, and this is what they did instead.
---
The "elegant" solutions are a joke and have no way of being controlled. How in the hell are you going to be able to preserve faction balance with server merges? Merges themselves (hey, guess what, your realm pop just doubled in size) are not immersive or vanilla-like. 
---
These options are so shortsighted. If populations are so high that layer must remain why not open new servers down the road rather than have blizz jump in and suddenly decide the server community and the names you've been seeing will all be doubled or triple or quadrupled. 
---
The real point is, no matter what blizz chose they would be bashed by the community and everyone would be freaking out with pitchforks in-hand trying to get as many people as they could to side with the idea that blizzbad and classic is dead.
---
Why aren't you breaking down each server into info?  How many English for x server, how many horde for x server?  This information currently is useless other than how many people are going to a server.
---
Thank god for not having a hour que time.

New players will also say "Fuck this" when they can't do their quests or have to stand around for an hour or more to just kill a quest mob.

You need to funnel people out of the starting zones as quickly as possible to get the best possible player retention.

They're on different layers. If he entered a new layer, he'd be able to see the people on that layer, but not the people on the others - it still breaks cohesion.

Lmao "from the surveys" taken from a minority of people who browse this subreddit. What a joke.

Don't worry about late game. Pick what weapon is best.

If you get say a small upgrade but as a staff which you have 1-300 in then consider how long you will use the staff before getting something better, but generally just take whatever is best and train it up, it doesn't take that long.
---
For every streamer getting camped, there will be a hundred more nobodies getting camped on their own pvp servers. That's how pvp goes.
---
Is this confirmed, though?
---
Raid related quests are supposed to be enabled in their respective phases.
---
But I thought regular quests and quest hubs were going to be all there at launch.
---
Is TB quest hub there in the beta? Will we have lvl50 ST quests? (Diamond flask)
---
Yeah I'd have to look into shift clicking quests themselves and not the markers. I'm hesitant to say I'll do it since I want the release to be as stable as possible for Classic so people can level with the addon without any errors.
---
Ill look into it though.
---
How is "not having responsibility" and "not keeping up their responsibilities" any different??
---
Either way we end up with an army of spergs running around shitting on anything they touch
---
No this was there in Vanilla, along with the night elf town north of the plaguelands.
---
Except one layer has the same capacity as a vanilla wow server. Multiply vanilla population times ten in Barrens and you can kiss your plainstrider quests goodbye.
---
This might have been the situation that I was recalling.  thanks for the input.
---
Pooling for wands is not terrible at all, getting the 58ish linen required for a wand nets you 2-3 wands so it's a waste of energy to have every priest in a guild get 58 linen. Even more so for the Greater Wand. But if you want to play solo nobody is stopping you.
---
Thex
---
Yeah I see that now my bad! I agree obviously that BfA is terrible. Bringing a diablo 3 mechanic (rifts) for the keystones failed in diablo to make it exciting and yet they brought it into the game...
---
Good to know who I’ll be ganking in Stv
---
&gt;Sure it would be nice if they stuck to mostly english on world chats
---
And they do! On the other realms. There's options where I don't have to deal with a large portion of BR players. None of this is convincing me to roll on Thalnos. My friend group/guild of about 20 people all don't want to roll on a BR server. Even if 3-4 people don't like the idea, large groups of people avoid that server.

I don't really RP myself but it's very appealing to join one, if only to escape any toxic behavior or the drama of (the followers of) streamers. 
---
I want to PVP but also want to join the RP server for the immersion/mature atmosphere. In EU it seems like less than 10% are going to roll RP-PVP so I'm a tad worried about population, maybe there won't be much PVP and the server might feel empty after a few phases..  
---
(Before anyone shoots me: I plan to just "RP" a very silent rogue and will not bother others, I've been on a RP server in retail for many years now and know all there is to know about the lore of the games.)

Great, thanks a lot.

nah austria but almost:),anywas thanks for clearing it up:) judt launched some addons, i could still login 3 hours ago, maybe when i get home they are still up #pray

Because they are suffering consequences from it, if it wasn't their responsibility then there would be no consequences.
---
You should see Mulgore!
---
Thex?
---
It's not about being a douche. The question is - should people who stream their playtime be given preferential treatment?
---
If so, why?
---
My answer would obviously be a resounding **NO**. Noone put a gun against their head and forced them to become """""""""""professional videogame players"""""""" instead of getting a regular job. So why should be treated any different than other players?
---
*laughs in "jajajajajaj"*
---
"The problem that layering was designed to help with is not server population, but population concentration to a small number of zones at the very beginning."
---
Except this is not the case, layers are designed to have the same population as a normal server according to blizzard. Layering or not, starting area are gonna be packed. (Sharding on the starting zones is what could have solved this if it was the problem).
---
The problem layer is supposed to fix is the population drop that is likely to happen.
---
Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
---
Because I don't know many BR who take english surveys on reddit who don't speak English and I've played with loads of Rag players. 
---
On top of all that, they run different hours where if I can't sleep I'll be dropped into the BR-realm. 
---
Also, once again, I've had really bad experiences with Rag players and wish to not deal with that if I have a choice.
---
My dwarf is in Ironforge.

My human is in Goldshire.

I will never see them again, but I know they rest easy in digital heaven forevermore.
---
Meanwhile, i have 3 level 120s and i don't relaly know what i did with them a few weeks ago. they're probably sitting a table waiting for their ~~mobile game~~ missions to return.
---
Here's how I would go at it:
---
* Log in a little early because the authetication servers will be hammered at 3PM
---
* You'll be taken to a list of offline realms. Pick yours and wait until the green Online at 3PM to enter
---
* In the meantime, type your least favourite streamer's name somewhere and copy it with CTRL-C
---
* As soon as you enter the char creation screen, CTRL-V the streamer's name in the box and press Accept
---
* Now you're free to create your own character
---
Holy shit this sub has turned into the biggest layering and streamer whine fest
---
Mikä on "koiso"?
---
Blizz drones never change. Making excuses for them is how we got bfa
---
I like the dead troll in the guild called I Want My Cheese Back. Lolol
---
But why for classic?
---
So *that’s* why I frequently get handed the ownership of /world on my BfA main. He’s been sitting that channel since mid-late Vanilla… probably aren’t too many others in the chance with that much time racked up.
---
Not that it matters, on Bleeding Hollow Alliance nobody ever talks in /world, even though there’s usually someone in it.
---
That's not how it should work, hopefully that will be fixed. All guildies will on default be on the same layer, always. Only changing when you join a group on another layer.
---
If you relog, you should again join the same layer as everyone in your guild.
---
There are issues with layering and I hope they fix them, because it's a lot better than the alternative with 12h queues.
---
Also, you can log in ahead of time (or so I heard), even though the realms are down. so you can work through the queue ahead of time. 
---
or so ive read.

Stardew valley is almost as dangerous as wow. My gf put in 40 hours in her first week playing it.
---
That's the server I'll be on
---
What does that have to do with layering, and the valid complaints raised against it?
---
A couple more questions:
---
What are the restrictions for naming? Min/max character count as well as what allowed characters?
---
If I end up reserving 3 names tonight and deciding I don’t like one, can I delete down to 2 and make a new 3rd name?

BRBRBRBRBR HUE HUE HUE HUE

Still doesn't answer my question...
---
How does that work the AH are already tied no new black lotus is introduced

I started in Mulgore, and I think it was 50% warrior...  Im sure it had to do with the race/class combo.  When I got to durotar there were a lot more clothies.

[https://gfycat.com/thisspecifickinkajou](https://gfycat.com/thisspecifickinkajou) 
---
where do i deny that the group could have had a part in causing the layer switch? it is only clear that it happened because i entered orgrimmar, who knows if it would have happened without the group. and again, we were on different continents at that time.
---
At the end of the day it’s sad the playerbase is now split. I never thought I would hate blizzard for making content but holy shit. Artifact power and keystone dungeons.. that isn’t fun at all. The meta for keystones is literally 3 rogue dps. Wow diversity at its finest
---
I don't think this would be hard to implement. If they treat servers in the same pool as layer for example but put the restriction to not allow hopping and make it so you can choose where you go at the beginning, then the technicals difficulties are already handled.
---
Think its pointless trying to change peoples opinions on multi-boxing, specially on this hell hole of a reddit.
---
Little advice from the video though, get a new microphone because everytime you spoke, the mic screech hurts the listeners ears.
---
Had a bug where me and a friend (who I had convinced to play classic because it was so much better than retail because it had a persistent world and stronger social atmosphere) were in a group and couldn’t see each other because we were layered. We were able to relog to fix it, but still did a bit of damage to my sense of world. Everything felt more fragile afterwards.
---
&gt;  Language chaos was part of it back in time. 
---
It wasn't  
---
people talked 95% English on the English servers.
---
Some people reported relogging fixed their layering issue
---
So having blizzard decide faction balance and population is your definition of preserving community and making it true to the classic experience? Do you not see what I am getting at here? It's all got massive downsides, but we just can't recreate 2005 again, it's not going to happen.
---
There is no winning for blizzard here. People would be just as furious with the alternative, because there truly is no elegant solution. It's trivially easy to open a new realm, and I think if layering is really that massive of a problem then that solution is about as elegant as it will get.
---
Pretty sure they are grossly underestimating how popular this will be at launch (e.g. see number of servers available at launch).  I look at layering as having the national guard on standby for when the disaster that is launch hits.
---
Not many are getting you're quoting Blizzard it seems. Maybe edit your post with quotes.
---
I thought some months ago that they didn't care about Wow Classic and wanted it to fail somehow to prove they were right and the past sucks.
---
But these last days I did realize how well prepared the launch seems to be. I think they did enough work to give it reasonable chances.
---
I went to Ironforge on Saturday. It was EMPTY.
---
Oh hell yes. Dungeons are no joke in classic. Every role is needed.
---
Hey, Welcome.
---
The best thing for you would be to join a guild and actively participate in the TS/Discord voice chat.
---
Easiest solo class is Hunter. However, everyone need Holy Priests, people will love you when you're a holy priest.
---
As for guides, get the Addon: "questie" and then just lvl up. maybe use [Leveling Guide from here](https://classicwow.live/)
---
Besides that, have fun.
---
It's mostly the intent of folks.
---
If they are deadset on refusing to speak english, you can't really pry it out of them.
---
The same on the pserver people of chinese nationality.
---
All of them could've used an english translator, but they chose not to, because their population numbers reach critical mass, therefore they did not need any outside help as they got all they needed within.
---
I'd maybe just see for a week how the population goes and if it's fun to play on US servers, do it. If not migrate. It's not like you need to a new game to play.
---
This won't be the case. The population likely won't drop off drastically enough for merges untill at very minimum a month if not two.
---
RemindMe!
---
Exactly... Which is what I said in my post. Let's all ignore them and root them out early :)
---
That layer was a full server.
---
You wouldn't be able to participate anyways in vanilla.
---
Who the hell are APES and what are they going to do to my server to be?
---
Lvling was always easy early except for some specific mobs like the damn mages in Westfall when you're lvl 12-14ish. 
---
I played the classic beta and when you started to reach 20+ it was quite annoying if you pulled more than 2 mobs at a time even as a hunter. You really had to work for it.
---
You also need to remember that this is a very easy game, in the easiest patch of it. It's time consuming, but not hard.
---
That sounds like literally the least fun thing you could have chosen to do during the stress test, but I guess that's part of what makes Classic great.
---
Something for everyone.

I played Vanilla on launch day, rolled NE I had fun, A LOT of fun. Never played horde seriously and never visited the zones in depth, I decided to roll horde this time.
---
I rolled a Tauren for the stress test, I had ton of fun talking with people in Mulgore. From a guy talking about his weight lost, to gardening to tips about the zones etc...
---
That's what I loved about Vanilla, the community was chill and relax. See you on the 27th, hope we can keep that nice ambience &lt;3
---
i've already caved and just admitted i'll play my hunter again. i'm okay with this.
---
i'm now struggling with 'skinning/LWing' like I did in 2004, or should i switch to the ever gold poor but meta complimentary engineering? 
---
aaarrrgh. i changed my mind every 2 mins.
---
What consequences???
---
Heard this as well and tried it for the stress test... the realms never turned green for me. It wasn’t until I checked the megathread and saw people were getting in that I relogged, waited in a short queue, and saw green servers. So unless I did something wrong, I’ve started to think this is just to get people to wait longer.
---
Oh man I thought I was the only one haha
---
I played 15 hours, didn't notice it once. Unlike stress test two where everything was phasing in and out constantly. Maybe it was more noticeable on EU this time around?
---
Yes.  You're supposed to swallow, right?  ...did I do something wrong?
---
Lol what? Even 5 servers wouldn't be enough.
---
Looks fun for an alt
---
I'll check but I think it's 16 characters. 
---
Yes you can delete and make another.
---
NA - no realm yet. Prefer Normal. Plan is to level a Forsaken priest (undecided on disc vs. holy), so would like to have others to heal! I’m located in the MST, and work two (!) jobs so I won’t be hardcore unfortunately. If you’re also chill and want heals, let me know!

Hi /u/xEcEz
---
Those are actually super solid additions, I will try to figure out what could actually be possible/feasible in terms of attendance, while keeping with the automated approach to things - there are some challenges to this!
---
As for the look, then I have actually tried to keep the Roster somewhat light, as this will likely be running in the background of people raiding, and wanting to impact lower-end systems as little as possible, but I could consider doing a remastered version with added graphics!  
---
Either way, thanks for the suggestions!
---
"just to solve a problem the might not even exist"
---
Layer hopping doesn't exist ? All the video on the front of this subreddit what are they ?
---
They mean you should'nt have posted a download link in the first place, rather than an informative landing page. Or, at the least, included it as a link within a text post.
---
F R E S H
---
You have to give credit where credit is due. Blizzard is fucking genius! Classic fanboys lose either way.
---
I feel like a member of the Undead race should be able to understand Humans atleast because I mean they were human at one stage and its not like you were mind wiped after you died.
---
I went with Turtle, since bread and fish are easy to come by.
---
&gt;made friends
---
Wonderful, you have a good chance of never seeing them again if you group up with the wrong person and are pulled into another layer.
---
Funny, I never used world in original classic, but this is good to know.
---
on all 5 English servers I've actively played - Yes
---
Not that easy. Lets say after a while 30% of players are gone.
---
With layering: reduce layers to 7 instaed of 10 (if it even needs to be done manually). done
---
With 10 servers:
---
ok, lets decide which 3 servers will get shut down by blizzard (massive uproar on the forums from people playing on one of those soon to be dead servers)
---
so the population of 3 servers will get split over the remaining 7 servers, that means guilds and players will have to decide, which one of the remaining 7 servers they will transfer to. Massive drama, friends being separated because they don't all go to the same server etc. Some of those remaining servers are getting to full, so those who didn't choose fast now have to transfer to other servers etc.
---
Which is better?
---
I'm Brazilian and I generally have terrible experience playing with other Brazilians. If given the choice I'd avoid them as well.
---
That's not how it works, you can still basically do anything you can do on a regular server except name your troll fourtwenty and spam barrens chat with chuck norris memes.
---
I didn't downvote you but you can't just only have layering in the starting zones. That's not how layering works.
---
Even if it drops to 50k by phase 2, they still are faced with an issue that adding new realms won't fix. They still won't be able to remove layering
---
Yes, because there is no clear indication on either the official website or from the streamers. The fact that you can play it by having any active subscription is clear, but the CD Key part is not that obvious and historically we've been used to purchase a key in order to play WoW, thus this confused a lot of people, including myself. Thanks for answering tho :)

---
Sent an email + reddit direct message!
---
&gt;  WildStar was the shit.
---
Yes it was. I miss it dearly everyday. 
---
I'm in the middle of uploading videos where I explored each zone for over an hour so people can watch and remember the game.
---
:&lt;
---
Dude me too! I don't wanna be obnoxious but I just fail to see why you would need to get your life cleaned up for WoW. Usually it's the other way around. I find it amazing I just don't get the why. Why for this? I feel like a dick here but you kinda didn't answer the question and I'm hella curious about why classic makes you go "better get my life in order for this" rather than "hell yea, finally some cool stuff to do while high and eating junk food" u know?
---
The people who quit because of layering will have made the community better anyways. Once layering is gone you'll find something else to whine about. I.e. spell-batching, not enough servers, mom didnt give you enough tendies, etc
---
Ah, the classic
---
don't worry guys it's just beta
---
don't worry guys it's just stress test 2 weeks before launch
---
don't worry guys it's just launch
---
Nothing important ever got fixed in 2 weeks before product launch
---
The way I see it is that everybody still need to login on the server and then get sent into a layer. That server login can only handle x amount of logins per second/minute and that is why you get queues.
---
Well the age of the game doesnt matter much to me, more the fact that it is increasingly community oriented and it somehow wakes a bit of passion in people. For me, it just makes sense to put in a bit of time and effort, when i have the option to do so, so other people can enjoy the game to the fullest ;)
---
They eat this shit up. Asmongold will make a 30 minute video about each individual gripe and it will go out to his 30k+ twitch watchers on three different youtube channels. This is candy for streamers.
---
Just roll on Thalnos and report back a few months after launch please.  That would honestly be the most helpful thing you guys who think Rag players aren't AIDS can do.
---
Rag is filled with the type of player that doesn't interrupt because they have no idea about dungeon mechanics, face pull, cause a wipe, blame someone else, and then drop grp after talking shit.
---
I have a few Rag players on my FL (like finding diamonds in a pile of shit)...and even they don't like to play with other Rag players lol.  It has nothing to do with ethnicity or the language they speak; its because they're not fun to play with.
---
They’re not going to fix this in two weeks... and knowing blizzard they’re going to stick to their guns and say it’s working “as intended” until people start to really get mad.
---
Some players prefer low population servers.
---
They have easier farming and such...
---
At some point it isn't "their type of humor" and they are just a toxic personality.
---
Uhhh what? Name res goes live for everyone at the same time Mr troll
---
Haha suddenly everyone is ok with the extreme layering we have seen evidence of now.
---
In exactly the same way US are crying about Brazilians you mean?  
---
Nobody except Germans and French are going to use the DE and FR servers leaving two realms for the dozens of other languages spoken in EU.  It's a legitimate concern.
---
no russian language option on flamegor and chromie? thats ridiculous :D
---
I agree it isn't ideal. But I still think it is better than going through multiple server merges.
---
&gt;hunter
---
All items are Hunter items, and all races are Hunter races ;)
---
so dont play a gnome... easy.
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
Who do we want?
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
What roles are in current demand?
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for dps at the moment.
---
Misc:
---
We are rolling on Pagle EST server for classic.
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT); planning for Sat/Sun evenings; 7pm-10pm.
---
Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even those with little interest in raiding).
---
World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
How to join?
---
https://discord.gg/RADdJwq . Feel free to ask any questions/contact us in discord.
---
I don't have a guild and I am forced to play with people, it's an MMO, hell it's classic where I can't just get away, the server you pick matters. 
---
It was brought to my attention that Rag might not be a BR server so that point is irrelevant but I would have to be blind to not see that Thalnos is being dropped by most of the committed classic community on EST and that furthers my reason for not touching it.
---
"Hey everyone, let's group up and do the world boss."
---
\*Group travels to the world\*
---
\*Group is split into 5 different layers\*
---
\*Group brakes as can't do the world boss\*
---
As shown already sharding makes doing group content worse, not better.
---
All the time. Southshore/Tarren Mill was like this on a daily basis on PvP servers. I rolled a warlock just so I could Rain of Fire the whole enemy group. 
---
The main difference was that in Vanilla your FPS would tank and become a slideshow and server lag would be horrible as well. From the videos of this event I’ve seen there are no performance/lag problems on Classic, just issues where you can’t join the fun because you’re not on the right layer.
---
You aren’t reasonable in the slightest, and turnabout is not fair play. This subreddit would be calling for streamers heads if they even dared to entertain the idea of dictating where you should be playing.
---
I've googled for the answer, but there was no relevant answer, thus why I've decided to ask here after all.
---
Their mount is a bicycle with a basket in the front.
---
My vanilla guild has the distinction of being one of (if not the only) guild to wipe on the original version of shaz.  For the first few months of the game he had no blink/teleport mechanic.  He just sat there and cast arcane explosion and put up his curse.
---
A trigger happy warlock queued up a shadow bolt during the pull and shaz happily came over to  the raid and ae'd everyone down.
---
I agree with you there.  I'd rather have massively flooded zones at the beginning, and the cities/towns full like they should be.  I'll level fishing and skin everything I see for the first few days, then after the leveling rush has subsided I'll start pushing.
---
I will be pretty disappointed if layering lasts for more than a couple weeks.
---
Play a human mage if you want. It’s not like human mage is unplayabale...
---
&gt; Vurtne, Shurrik, ... should all the people who made pvp videos in vanilla get naming reservations?
---
What about famous pve players? (Kungen, ...)
---
If you follow the same logic I outlined above and apply it to your questions here I'm sure you'll reach the conclusion that no, I don't care if they get to reserve their names. Also factor in that I'm not planning to name my warrior "Kungen" and I'm sure you'll realise the level of "I don't care" I feel towards the subject.
---
Poetic.
---
Complaining at game breaking bug is not worth the efforth? Huh
---
Not at all. Layering a fundamental attack on the coherency of the world and the whole social aspect that live killed. Spell batching and my access to delicious tendies pale and comparison to the layering issue.
---
Is forsen the biggest? I'd imagine he'd roll on Swezzrah.
---
Arms is the way to go until you get some bonus hit chance.
---
I mean I have shitty experiences with American players all the time. It doesn't seem to be exclusive to just Brazilians.
---
But that extra int....
---
Cool strawman.
---
I played a Tauren all weekend, and I grouped with many strangers. The world felt full and was thriving.
---
Im sure those were not Agamaggan, Spinebreaker and Haomarush
---
It’s 11 US and 2 EU [link](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-realm-names-and-types/246645) and I get the “mega” aspect; but my point still stands. They aren’t going to merge them and if they do, they won’t split them out first.
---
Still not clear where you tried them - on the alpha/beta/stress test servers of Classic?  
---
Some addons are complete already, while some only have partial Classic support currently.
---
For example, Bartender4 says "Preliminary WoW Classic support, not fully complete yet" - which would both means some features not working on Classic yet but at the same time it also means that progress is done and big chances are it's going to be done for Classic release.
---
Other addons, such as SexyMap, require you to go to the Files tab and download the Classic specific file.
---
World first scarab lord was on Medivh 14 years ago. Nobody gives a shit about who collects the most runecloth in 2020.
---
Saturation is a poor word choice here, since it can be confused with/related to other monitor-related jargon (contrast/brightness etc)
---
We were there in Westfall too but couldn't get into this layer in the picture since they were all in the same two raids :(
---
5% intellect is nothing. It’s about 0.2% crit and some mana. People roll Gnome Mage because escape artist is very strong for pvp.
---
it doesn't matter what his intent is, he's still a massive dildo and anyone over the age of 14 sees it clear as day and collectively sighs any time his name comes up
---
Lol.. pvp servers
---
extra 5% Int is not huge, only huge thing is escape artist and its mostly for pvp so if you are not into pvp go human
---
Yeah i remember his saying that a few times during the beta.
---
Agreed. As someone who just doesn't want to deal with any of the streamer server side effects, this process just gets annoying.
---
Between this, Brazilians and Spanish servers, I have no idea where to safely roll on an East coast PVP server
---
Aren't the LFG and WD channels only available in capital cities though? That's what I remember at least, I started playing during WotLK.
---
Spanish people are chill but also terrible at English which is why people probably want to avoid them.
---
It’s not that big of a deal

---
The extra int is nothing. Not sure if trolling or not
---
There is a video number one of them answering the question in a Q and A that was reported on multiple times. But my point is that this question is asked on the Reddit like 4 times a day so before you post it just search and see what everyone else has already said. It kind of gets annoying seeing teh same question spammed on a Reddit
---
Are the stress test servers officially offline now?
---
I love my carebear servers because I can choose when to fight, not because there's no fighting.
---
Thanks :) working on it now
---
Thanks a bunch /u/Gloodizzle I am actually quite short on real life karma, so well-wishes means a lot!
---
Lemme know if it turns out to be of use!
---
how is the title misleading? it describes exactly what is happening in the clip.
---
if i could edit the original post i would have already done it sooner because there were multiple people saying it could have been the group invite, but apparently i can't edit posts with videos. 
---
still, the issue everyone has is that the layer change happened when entering orgrimmar, even though everyone thought zone border won't have any effect to the layering system, which apparently is not the case.
---

My bad.. Go to curseforge, there u can change the game verison to 1.13
---
Layering is ruining Classic and Blizzard have not told us if any of these exploits will be addressed by launch (and locked this thread, no less):
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/examples-of-layering-exploits-and-problems/198240
---
I suppose /say is local (layer specific), but General/Trade are server-wide, covering all layers.
---
Dynamic spawns already exist. It's not enough to warrant removing layering.
---
I love gnomes. Gnomes are life.
---
Yes. It's why most of us are set on playing Herod because the other two have communities that are not favorable.
---
&gt; Even if it drops to 50k by phase 2, they still are faced with an issue that adding new realms won't fix
---
Which would be, what?
---
Indeed! I felt like Alliance players could do with some love as well, and it gives me a lot more opportunities, story-telling-wise! :) 
---
They might well meet up at some point!
---
ITS OK TO BE BRAZILIAN
---
Do you really think that the stress test is 1:1 analogous to launch in terms of concurrent users? I'm 99% sure they cranked the layering up proportional to how many users they expect. And why wouldn't they want to test layering, as part of server stability tests?!
---
What's the reason behind most of those countries refusing to learn English?
---
And much appreciate the kind comments /u/Kruklyn \- hope you let me know if anything sticks out!
---
I don't have a source or anything, but I was under the impression that the only automated thing that could happen was chat squelching.
---
Nobbel has done Classic Lore and its really good
---
Exactly!!
---
I did that a lot in the test and it was awesome. You don't see that in BFA. In BFA you just automatically gets an interface option to join a custom group with random strangers with whom you never share a word
---
It makes a tangible impact to the entire World of Warcraft experience - a massive part of what people love about Classic Wow is the permanence of everything (Learning all of the people on your server, seeing them in 'their spots', etc).
---
Sure there are people who complain just to complain, but this is a massive issue for a lot of players and you not caring doesn't delegitimise their issues
---
Not that it troubles me, but is posting a straight link to a download against reddits guidelines or something? It's the first time I've ran into one.
---
You realise your latency would put a serious dampener on gameplay, right? Most of us on the Oceanic test realm just had our first taste of 20-40ms latency, as we used to play with 10x that. Trust me, you don't want to play like that after being used to what you have now.
---
Griefing and excessive camping is againt rules on every server
---
There's hardly any realms. There will be "serious" raiders and guilds on all of them.
---
Mankrik all the way. ALLIANCE PLEASE COME TO MANKRIK WE LOVE YOU.
---
There's more good streamers than bad tbh and I'm perfectly fine with them existing but I'm not ok with them forming raids from viewers to brute force their goals on PVP.
---
Spanish players are by far the worst  I've encountered online.
---
Rubs hands. *evil laughter*
---
I just had a brilliant idea.
---
The good news is that private servers will become so much more accurate now that they have an actual live server to pull data from.
---
Yes the "specific kind of conservative" who watches all those people you don't like on youtube and has clearly never thought about their views before. Of course. You keep bringing up this 13/50 strawman as if it has any relevancy whatsoever. Most people who watch those youtubers you hate don't think black people commit crime "as a result of their race." This is just ignorance toward the other side on your part. Usually the argument comes from the idea that their toxic culture is at least somewhat responsible instead of just solely "racism." 
---
Also, Asmon has literally banned black emotes from his channel because he doesn't like them being used for any kind of racist humor, yet you're sitting here talking about how he would be arguing for slavery if it was still around. 
---
Almost everything you've said is very out of touch with what the reality of the situation is, so I can tell you have no real clue what you're talking about. But you seem to think you're really, really smart. I'm sure that must count for something. Keep sticking it to those dumb conservatives.

thx France Aubergine for the inspiration
---
I don't see why People still compare numbers from private Servers to actuall classic. They have been wrong in a lot of cases. I wouldn't even believe the numbers those dodgie private Server People give us. 
---
I think retail Players are much more likely to stick to classic than some random dude just downloading WOW for the first time thinking "this is expensive" and therefore taking a private Server for a couple of hours until he realises he doesn't like wow.
---
Don't compare to private Servers!
---
Blizzard is a big ass Company with plenty of People probably smarter than us - and also more experience than us. 
---
Do you think they wouldn't have had this idea? They're gonna read this and go "OMG how did we not think about this?! This is the smartest idea ever" 
---
NO they have thought of this and it isn't feasable for a Million Player Company which has a lot of responsibility on their shoulders.
---
You know People are gonna bring the pitchforks if things don't go 99,999% according to Blizzard plan so I totally understand Blizzard taking the other - more save route.
---
I played on a vanilla server with a very heavy Brazilian influence. You mainly couldn't tell and most of them were polite and easy to group with. The main thing is you is how big of a population will be there. Not actually against her trolling on it but I'm waiting for other factors to reveal themselves
---
Yea I agree! Would be a shame if we had to invade out smaller brothers because they can’t pronounce the server correctly.. ;)
---
Layer changes upon invite. So scout and invite.
---
Even if there are some issues with layering, it isn't the end of the world. The system is temporary.
---
I'd rather deal with potential issues than stare at a server queue, any day.
---
You think that someone willing to follow and camp streamers would be deterred by something like this?
---
U what
---
Alot of places look better with the new lighting and shading system with the new engine.
---
If u wanna be a casual noob, play pve
---
this is low effort troll
---
So I take it you are a fan of layering and want to keep it for the entire game? That's a pretty rare opinion around these parts if that's the case.
---
Yeah his parents have a nice place
---
Oh wow, I was part of this without even realising it. I just followed a bunch of players and ended up in Goldshire. It was the best experience I had on the stress test, unfortunately my gear was all broken about 30 min to the raid and I just kept running in and out, trying to distract the Alliance players.

---
Yes, until release.
---
If all goes according to plan, layering won't be there when the World Boss phase hits (phase 2).
---
But that's part of my point tho.
---
I started playing in WOD, and I still think it's the best mmorpg there is despite not having played vanilla.
---
I have no nostalgia
---
Would like to know this too.
---
Yeh but many of us are adults now and don’t have time to spend hours waiting in queues.
---
Man i dont know, but the wow announcement did it for me.
---
Oh okay. So it's not bad because it didn't happen to you. Great argument.
---
So you're not prepared to play a human because you'll lose a near-meaningless 5% int but you're willing to change your entire faction and lose it anyway..?
---
I got banned after killing someone and camping them for 2 hours...
---
Do we know what servers they plan on rolling on yet? Planning on US PvP-ET but really dont want to do anything in regards to asmon, soda I dont mind cause he himself isnt an issue.
---
I was just browsing new and the same things kept coming up. Figured I might as well put it together.
---
There are only so many items or effects that benefit stealth levels. They should be infinite since stealth level and detection works like weapon skills (attack rating vs defense, stealth level vs detection)
---
The best PVP items are in Raids so even dedicated PVP's will be raiding seriously.
---
How do I go about contacting you, got a discord or anything?
---
What exactly is layering, if you don't mind me asking?
---
RP servers are for RP. Not a streamer containment zone.
---
Me? I'm going to be making a channel named /Thex
---
If you abuse the auto ban by mass reporting, you get banned yourself eventually. Happened to half my guild during Aggrammar progress, they reported someone because the whole server was trolling that person, when they lifted that person's ban, all who reported him got banned for 24hs for abusing the report system.
---
To clarify, I tried shift clicking the marker on the map.
---
cuz thems the rules
---
Hoes mad.

Aye if you had millions of people constantly pinging your servers for updates you'd literally DoS yourself! Makes sense that there is an interval.
---
Could you do 2 reserves on 1 server then and the final reserve on another server?
---
You probably already know how to copy the templates (there are likely several different ways), but ***just in case*** you're unfamiliar with 'Google Sheets': [https://i.gyazo.com/6a590e8d2d8ae780946543c00aa21f73.png](https://i.gyazo.com/6a590e8d2d8ae780946543c00aa21f73.png)

Not if I get it first!

 **RemindMe! 15 days**
---
This is gold and so true
---
Dude... I love how you "I think" "I believe" everything... It just Shows you actually have no clue and think "this can't be too difficult - I'm brilliant" :D
---
They tested a working System for several month's now and you think they will Change it 2 weeks Prior to release - with no Beta tests - not even a stress test left xD
---
You life in you own world I believe. I think it can't be too hard to get that it is not possible
---
Yes. Names are available in just over eight hours time.
---
Today’s purpose is not primarily character creation, it’s name reservation.
---
I'm pretty sure Scandinavians picked shazzrah under the understanding that Spaniards will play on golemagg since that was what they claimed they'd do a few days ago... tbh one of the communities should switch over to the other server or it will likely cause problems.
---
He is buffed af with two core hounds.
---
&gt;Can this attitude just die already?
---
The same can be said about the attitude towards Layering. Sorry but your argument is broken already. You either play, or you don't. Layering isn't changing anytime soon. It's here dude. Submit or Quit. I never said you couldn't speak about it - Speak all you want dude. Go nuts. Go on a huge rant. I'm sure people will support it. I'm just asking why you would play if it's as horrible as you make it out to be. I disagree, it's perfectly fine as long as it's held to "the promise". It must not be as bad as you are making it out to be, if you're still playing and enjoying the game.
---
&gt;And if it stays in the game longer than they've implied then I'll quit.
---
Oh I can 100% agree with you there. This is my only concern. If it goes past Phase 1, then it's a broken promise on top of serious exploits during a critical timeframe of the game.
---
Overall, cool man. Keep complaining about it. GL with traction and I hope it leads to a more helpful solution :)
---
Yeah by that point you probably have like 2-3 days /played  
---
That's a lot of hours to just throw away.
---
I prefer PvE. Some days I just want to chill and progress my character without getting ganked for hours at a time. Other days I do like to world PvP. On those days I simply join /world_defense and police Azeroth. I get the best of both worlds imo.
---

Let them have it early. Everyone wants to play with their own name and taking that from them is honestly more toxic than you believe them to be. 
---
If we're really getting up in arms about streamers wanting fucking early name holding of all things then we as a community don't even deserve to play Classic. 
---
Downvote me honestly, but the way you guys hate streamers is absolutely toxic.
---
Make sure you are keeping circulation in your legs at good levels at all times when you are sitting for extended periods (Like when playing WoW for XX hours a day) I almost died to that last year, a famous esports caster (Incontrol) died to that some weeks ago. I was also working out and eating clean, no drugs. The final warning sign that can appear before it kills you is a strong pain in your lower leg, like if your muscles are REALLY sore even though you did not work out in the last days. If you expierence that call an ambulance right away.
---
Things you can do to help with circulation : Eat less carbs in your meals and more protein. Stand up every few hours and have a short walk, stretch. Make sure your sitting position does not restrict blood flow (I was sitting in a position that restricted bloodflow, was the final straw probably)
---
No, I want them to make way more servers and jettison the idea of layering into the sun, with server merges as the populations decline. Fuck layering just do it how vanilla did it. We want vanilla not this bullshit
---
For name reservation only. Otherwise people would be saving a hundred names for themselves and their friends and their grandmothers alts and it’s just better that blizzard limits it to 3 per person before launch.
---
Remember that no matter what kind of guild you're making, leadership skills and "marketing" are important.
---
Set clear concrete goals, even if they're casual, and give people a reason to stay in your guild instead of a thousand others.
---
For a casual environment, an idea could be weekly wPVP events that aren't found anywhere else - that could also draw in people from the outside, who'd then want to join you.
---
Make people have fun.
---
the "prove god does not exist" argument
---
The brits have claimed Shazzrah.
---
You can only RESERVE 3 names.  At launch, you can create as many characters as you want.
---
The fanbase crowds the server they stream on.
---
Is it bad that i have thought aboutgetting myself a girlfriend this summer jus tot have her heal me in classic?
---
altough I ended up playing video games al summer instead, again.
---
i have names for each class that i wanted to reserve
---
Second question, will this option to create a name become available at 3 PDT on battlenet, or are there steps I need to take prior to that? As of now I don’t see the location that the name reservation will be available.
---
Source?
---
Removing rain is the single most baffling design decision Blizzard ever made.
---
Golemag is for spanish people so I heard. Shazzra  it is
---
Was it any good though?
---
Yes, all but Druid.
---
By marker, i meant spawn points. The problem with hiding quest icon markers is that theres no way to bring them back apart from running `/codex reset `.
---
Private servers really scewed people's opinions of hunters since people are worried about getting a raid spot
---

---
There we go.

Taz just give it up man, people gonna defend layering no matter what, classic is going to be a shitshow
---
No one please take ‘Kirito’ I’m a massive weeb and want to make a duel wielding rogue.
---
Please note that Asuna is free to use, but please be a girl or it will be awkward when I try contacting you.
---
well best pick the three you really like
---
Layering/sharding doesn't care if you are in a group, this has been the case the whole beta. If people are talking about something that doesn't exist then that's grand but what people are currently talking about is the sharding that is in the game two weeks before launch.
---
Gnome gang! I wish they had a healer so that a 5 man gnome squad would be possible
---
All of this lmao

Because there was 30 dead servers in Vanilla... smh.

Buffing every player in sight with Fort was so much fun. I even managed to save about a dozen players questing with clutch heals. Also if I had the mana to spare I’d throw a mind blast on whatever another player was fighting, toss them a renew, and continue on my way.
---

Lol i let my handsome cow man die a gruesome death at the edge of the barrens and said, “naw, definitely not running back there.” Sorry ghost cow man.
---
What was proven wrong that people had cried about?
---
Honestly the number of players who browse r/classicwow isn't large enough to make a dent in your chances. This just stops the millions of posts asking the same things over and over ;)
---
Yeah, and 0.5% more crit
---
Thank you 😁
---
The name shazzrah sounds way better (that was my initial pick but then I heard of the spaniards joining it).
---
The baguette glaive got me LOL'ing.... the baglaives
---
That's what makes it an MMO, otherwise you might as well play a singeplayer RPG.
---
Once you get past the title since it's not true. I think he might mean like pre current wow as classic but not what we think of as classic. He has things like the full Silvana story which is not classic and the full Lich King story which is not classic. Even some of his videos that involve places in classic show how they evolve through the game later. I don't really want to watch videos about current or slightly less current wow I would prefer videos about classic wow.

In before streamers actually roll on Thalnos and only said they weren’t so trolls don’t snipe their names.

So it's not confirmed then
---
"They tested a working System for several month's now and you think they will Change it 2 weeks Prior to release - with no Beta tests - not even a stress test left xD"
---
Well the thing is it still isn't working...
---
Thank you for this!

Sad, horrible truth...

why aren't you a sarcastic redditor.
---
What is a tendie?
---
Scandis are not any sort of majority of Shazz based on the earlier poll and we all speak English in public chats anyway. 
---
Benelux+Brits+Scandis always the best combo from my previous realm experiences.
---
u got that backwards.  layering causes all kinds of problems for everybody, merging hurts the few.
---
layers put long-term players and tourists all on the same realms.  this brings all the additional problems of layers while they exist, and then when you remove layers you get queues and server transfers on the majority of the playerbase.  this is the truly un-vanilla.
---
having many realms separates long-term players and tourists into realms with queues (long term) and realms without queues (tourists).  tourist realms die in a few weeks, and would need to be merged.  these realms are dead, merging them has no impact on most people.
---
Not gonna lie, people like you feel like corporate plants. 
---
Before I might have been opposed to a lot of things, or at least sympathetic, now I kinda want layering to go longer out of spite.
---
No, it won't affect any form of instances.
---
Layering is the entire world (of warcraft ;D) instanced with a cap of aruond 3500 players. When it's reached, it'll add another layer with 3500 players. This is to make sure people don't need to queue for 12 hours, server crashes because of overload and it's all havoc at release.
---
Think if it as a dynamic server system. When a server is full, it creates a new virtual server that new players who log in play on, but it still has access to the same auction house, player base for whispers / invites to group between each layer.
---
Do you mean MMOs or games in general?
---
I will do the same this time around. I'll consume classic very slowly, savoring every ounce of it, full lore. &lt;3
---
That reminded me of those hopeless "3dps lf tank and healer" people spamming all day.
---
Wow I never knew that you could speak in WorldDefense if you were a high enough rank.  That's actually really cool!
---
it's a good thing wtf?
---
what do you care more about ?  
---
Stats or looks.  
---
Go for the one you care the most
---
I would as well.
---
Groups are in theory supposed to be in a single phase, but it's two weeks until launch and it's completely bollocked - and as we've all experienced 100 times by now if something has made it to Beta it's not being changed before release lol
---
So from what I've read Layering is basically having say 10k players on one server but having them split into 2.5k splits but all still being on the same server and it has the capacity to keep creating layers to put up with player number demand. So you have 4 layers of 2.5k players on one server (numbers are made up btw)  But they put that in place to help launch classic so 10k players aren't fighting over the starter quest mobs and also so the servers don't totally blow up. 
---
That said they have said that they plan it to be a short term thing (3-4weeks ish) after the launch before its removed and they have guaranteed its going before the end of phase 1 (MC,Ony,Mauradon).  
---
But from playing the stress test I never noticed getting layered in any aspect but some players have but they did say the stress test layering was a far lower threshold than what the actual classic release will be.
---
Hope this helps.

I played as a hunter and my GF as a priest and we actually struggled a lot if we pulled 4~~ mobs at once. My pet would instantly die and it was chaos. We died a lot of times ^^,
---
It will work in classic?
---
He is clearly a master baiter.  It's an art, not a science.
---
make sure you get unarmed leveled up as well. Super important if you get disarmed.
---
Now that's podracing!
---
Go Shazzrah then mate.
---
You're delusional if you think only a dozen or so want to gank asmon lol
---
There are pieces that entirely form because of the fault of the streamer like: Gold distribution, zergging, scarab lord and potentially a bunch more.
---
Sometimes I also get the wrong mob name on the nameplate. If I click on the nameplate again it updates with the correct name of the mob.
---
Not in black and white, but why would they time gate people? If there was a cut off point that is critical information don't you think? I doubt Blizzard would fail to mention this.
---
Sheers
---
This is quite literally player harassment. This is bannable in RuneScape even though obviously killing people isn't against the rules . But going out of your way to only kill one person and disrupt their gameplay for extended periods of time will not go well and I can see action happening on these "gankers".
---
&gt;Opening up "many more servers" costs many more money, something Activision is against. If they do spin up a few dozen extra servers, they could become ghost towns in a few months, which will lead to mass merging.
---
No it does not, all servers are cloud based there is no physical machine for each server. So having 100k players on 2 servers with layers is hardly any different from having 20 servers without layering.
---
&gt;Merging is a pain (name changes, World 1st issues, new faction balance issues, etc)
---
Name changes can be prevented by having servers destinated to merge which shares names in advance. There's no reason to think that faction balance will be any different. And no idea what you mean by 1st world issues.
---
3. This is a good argument.
---
Ran off apoligies, I remember it mostly throughout Feralas, where I knew I met the guy before. Editing!
---
They should pull their heads out of their asses and communicate more. They should have forced themselves to launch without layering to keep the experience intact. They could do it then and they could have done it now - if they wanted to. So many better solutions have been proposed on this subreddit alone...
---
correct.  
---
Not sure about your server location, but al my servers where West EU location based.  
---
So its kinda normall people talked english there.
---
We're all still waiting for confirmation I think.
---
Merci !
---
Friends and guildmates decided on Herod regardless of what streamers do.  The People's Server post got me in the feels and helped my decision as well.
---
Same here
---
This post is ridiculous. All the people are at westfall. Ended up having 2 raid groups vs 2 raid groups in westfall last night. That's over 100 players duking it out. No one is going to be afk standing in capital on a stress test AND of course starting zones are empty. Most people have out leveled the starting area 2 days into the stress test. Had this post come up at literal launch times you'd see hundreds of people crammed everywhere. I also layer phased mid combat so that still isn't fixed even though they said it was, That's what this post should state. But no. No real problem is being stated just people whining about nothing.
---
The alternative is better than layering.
---
I had 200-300 latency playing on oceanic. I was level 10 before I realized I wasn't on a NA server, and that was from chat channels and not due to latency.  I know it was low pop by the end, but it wasn't terrible! I think op can make it work
---
Well, smart people told you about it months ago, why bother now? It will not get fixed. You can bet all your money on that. Only fix they can apply now is complete removal of layering, which is not going to happen, at least at launch...
---
D:
---
There are at least several problems with streamers that if the streamer willed it, could be resolved.
---
Who knows. Just want to be careful-- Still think the idea of making the cahracter as quick as possible, deleting, and going back is gonna be smart. Just think I'll try doing that later tonight not next week.
---
* up to 50
---
There's a difference between seeing people and teaming up and having to stand in one spot waiting for a single mob to continuously respawn bc 19 people need tiger pelts.
---
There is a pulldown menu where you can select Classic. Be sure to choose correct version before you attempt dl.
---
Yup after all the addons and tweaks (I still can't get the name plates in ElvUI to work) all I did was roll a Horde character to 2-5 in each zone and then rolled a bunch of shaman from Durotar to check out different questing paths/routes.
---
Warriors and mages were highest dps throughout most of classic, warlocks get up there around aq/naxx
---
My years of playing in the private server community have shown that you may underestimate the power of FRESH.
---
People are always chasing new servers because they get behind 20 levels and think they'll never catch up.  It sounds ridiculous because it is but that's the mentality.  Watch /r/wowservers sometime, there's always a group of people asking for F R E S H
---
What you seem to not understand is that Herod would change dramatically when they do roll there yes there are some people that would try to grief them but there subscribers and followers would be there to stop it. He wouldn't need to reroll they would just make your server a streamer server.
---
Good comment.
---
"FIGHT!" - everyone runs away.
---
Just decided shazzrah for pvp and mirage raceway for pve (friend plays on it) (also made a post few minutes ago)
---
Avoiding people who you can't communicate is way more important than avoiding streamers.
---
You can talk to fanboys and streamers, and still form groups. The NA pop is slowly starting to avoid Thalnos. So I would worry far more about that, than avoiding every single streamer.
---
&gt; I will say as a wow vet it shocks me people still tolerate a queue in the first place;
---
People don't tolerate queues. The people who say "bring back queues" assume that *they* won't be the ones waiting. It'll be some other person who doesn't matter to them.
---
When it turns out that they wait as much as anyone else, they'd be here, having a meltdown about how Blizzard is crippling Classic by not having enough servers/purposefully capping player populations too low/not having a way to have lots of people log in without killing starting zones.
---
The key thing to remember is that the people who are complaining will always complain. That's the part of WoW they like. The complaining.
---
user name checks out
---
I can definitely see your point, but there's still fun to be had :)
---
My guild levelled to 15 like mad men (orc hunters only, all pets were boars named Alliance), twinked out with quest &amp; crafted gear, enchants, pots &amp; elixirs and raided Ewlynn &amp; Redridge. It was epic. Basically we weaponised our greatest strength - unbridled autism.
---
Thank you for the warning sir. I appreciate it.
---
Here go friend, I have a product I want to sell you https://www.amazon.com/Initech-Jump-Conclusions-Office-Space/dp/B07GL3CBBZ  
---
BTW, the way I have always read the blizzard version of dynamic respawns is not by quest type, but by world area.  So, even if you don't have stuff to kill for your quest, you have other things near by that you can kill.  When those die, sometimes you get another random spawn, or you might get a quest spawn.
---
At the rate my friends play it will probably be next year before they are 60. I plan on getting there within a couple of months. I let them know that is *bare minimum* if they play a decent amount of time. They almost expected to be done in a week early on.
---
pic didn't even mention golemagg guards the entrance to ragnaros behind him, the most chad feature of all
---
My group of friends is reserving their main character on all 3 EST PvP servers, that way come launch when we finally see where the streamers are going we will be able to choose an alternative.
---
They literally stream themselves for others to watch. They want attention for money
---
Dude, I don't know what the fuck you want. All I said was Layering is awful and you acted like I said the Nazi's make a few good points.
---
You clearly have a problem with people talking about layering but want to pretend like you don't. 
---
&gt; It must not be as bad as you are making it out to be, if you're still playing and enjoying the game.
---
This is idiotic. And false by your own admission. It is stopping me from enjoying a huge part of the game. And it will make me quit. You acknowledge that the problem is bad enough to cause both myself and yourself to quit, but here you want to pretend like that's not true. This is literally a case of doublethink out in the wild. 
---
Simultaneously, I have a broken argument for saying layering will drive me out of the game, while you think it's 100% valid to quit if layering stays in the game. 
---
I don't even know what you want. I don't even know how to talk to you. We should talk about the problem, but only if it doesn't annoy you too much? 'Layering is a problem, but if you complain about it go away, also if layering stays I'll go away but come on its not a big deal, but I too dislike it, but not enough to quit, but why dont you just quit like I'll do later?'
---
I do not understand you.
---
It's pretty clear that /u/guruftw has no idea what they're talking about and is just interested in trolling.
---
I mean isn't that kinda the point? You're leveling in redridge and there could be a massive pvp raid with hundreds of players right where you stand and you might not even notice it.
---
Where is Czech Republic ?
---
Herod isn't my server, it's our server, brother.
---
Technology can hold 5x that by now, sure.  But the game design had a finite cap in mind, and if we change that, we lose that whole #nochange thing.
---
Awesome info! I would have been mad lol
---
Do you have to actually enter your character into the game world to reserve it, or just create it?
---
Thalnos is confirmed to be where the Brazilians are rolling, and there's word that some spanish speakers will be on Faerlina (personally don't think this will be very noticeable). Streamers up in the air, but honestly with how popular Herod will be, I see them going there
---
Join Oceanic server, make 3 Characters with the name variants of Eight. Wait till launch and sell account. EZ money.
---
Right? Just like the old days. Lots of people got scammed in Vanilla. That's just how the game is.
---
What is layering? I’m somebody who used to play back in the day super casually but am considering playing wow classic when it comes out
---
man, good for you
---
* Asmongold calling in his sperg-army to follow you around and spam /spit on you if you're using a mount he doesnt like or have.
---
* Sodapoppin claiming he'll put anyone that slightly ticks him off on a "blacklist" which will forever prevent that person from getting into any decent guilds, raids, pugs, ect.
---
* absolutely 0 chance of ever competing in things like gold &amp; controlling the market, getting server-firsts, going for the aq-opening mount, winning any massive ow-pvp, because these top streamers will have thousands of followers supporting and following them, which could also lead to severe realm-economy imbalances.
---
* and the top reason: their followers &amp; communities
---
Just create it. You won't be able to log into the world.
---
Sad reacts only...
---
Could you give me a link perhaps? If thats true in def not joining them
---
I’m making a horde PVP character and a alliance PvE but I’m just basing that on my two separate friend groups
---
I mean, it's better than having an annoying Exclamation mark forever and ever in that area, right? I can pick up a quest I accidentally hid and it still functions the same.
---
Layering is ruining Classic and Blizzard have not told us if any of these exploits and problems will be addressed by launch (and locked this thread, no less):
---
I say bring back queues, I know I'll be waiting. We say bring back queues not because we love having to wait to play, we do not. We say bring back queues because layering is so much worse than queuing. Queing just makes me wait to play the game, layering kills the soul of the game.
---
Lol a human priest
---
Mate, it's two weeks to launch. Ya ain't that delusional are ya?
---
This doesn't match what I saw in the NA normal realm on Sat and Sun; I saw a crowded Goldshire with many duels. SW was emptier but not desolate and honestly what is a playerbase capped at 15 going to do there? I myself only went to look for a level 8 weapon (note: looks like they start at 10).
---
You only need to have an abonnement paid.
---
Me and Zingashinga are pretty new to the bar business and came rather ill equipped I do admit.
---
Not true. My server used LFG for finding groups. Spam or off topic was frowned upon.
---
Only mages outperform them
---
Unrelated but there was a story about a guy, playing vanilla as a kid, that had a very bad PC and he would crash if he entered Orgrimmar every time.
---
So he would gather crafting mats in Durotar and sell them to people there, so they could sell it in the city. And of course he would get ripped off every time.
---
Please by all means go ahead. If you can;t take being corrected, that is probably the best option for everyone involved.
---
Just a monthly Subscription and that's all
---
It is my understanding that you can play classic with just a subscription.
---
My friend group is Alliance, rolling on Pagle.  It’s mostly Alliance and we think that will make it easier to form groups, especially after the population drops off in a month or two.  We’re not interested in PvP tho.
---
just a sub, thats all she needs
---
Actually, I didn’t. Feel free to check my history
---
For EU
---
Preach Gaming and Nobbel87 will be on Shazzrah and Taliesin will be on Zandalar Tribe
---
So any player that ganks on a PvP server gets banned ? I doubt that holds up.
---
Why does everyone hate streamers so much?
---
I can verify this is true. It's not case sensitive.
---
Theres literally "love" in his sentence
---
Boss should have gone for the head.
---
The link I quoted and linked is a blizzard employee saying that the name is released immediately, so for safety's sake assume that is the case.
---
If your concern is that you make a char quickly, delete it later and make a new one with the right class and appearance and find that the name isn't free because the server has not updated, I don't know what to say really because there is no evidence that this is the case.
---
lol, i cant even be mad.
---
Esfand is the king of reasonable takes, this one makes sense too.  Just make someone verify that they have what, over 100 subs or a peak of 1000+ viewers and fine, you pick ONE name (your streamer name) in advance.  Then you compete with everyone else to get Thex
---
Do you realize by starting some stupid war with streamers youre literally just feeding them content and money. Any time a battle breaks out from anti streamer spergs vs asmongold spergs itll be chopped up and put on youtube. This whole retarded movement will do nothing but promote them, viewers love drama
---
Is a layer change always  instantaneous?
---
I had no issue soloing on a range of classes. But that's not my point.
---
To me, layering has more of an impact on the spirit of the game than things being overtuned or not working exactly right. My ability to engage with other players was not in any way hindered.
---
The spirit of the MMO is the people, *not* receiving 84 damage from a mob instead of 110. The world, the leveling, the dungeons and the gear are all just a means to get us engaged with the other people playing the game. Without people, that stuff doesn't matter.
---
The "experience" you mention is seeing a stranger get adds that he cannot survive so you rush to his aid casting Flash Heal and adding him to group. You throw down an emergency PW:Shield and help him finish them off. He laughs and thank you, and you say "I'm glad I got to you in time, that was close!" and you ask if you can join him since you're on this quest too. He just finished it with those adds you helped kill, but he says sure and you two spend 20 minutes more there waiting for respawns and such, but you chit chat and get to know each other. You finish up the quest and part ways, adding each other to your friend lists. The next day you see purple text appear in your chat window and it's the guy you helped and he's inviting you to a dungeon with his friends.
---
Do you think mobs being slightly overtuned or layering would have a more significant impact on my experience there.
---
I'm pretty sure UK is Shazzrah?
---
I am going all in on Whitemane... for better or for worse.

---
I actually think the amount of server sounds about right.. for 6 months after launch. they are underestimating how many people are gonna give it a try on launch
---
There shouldn't be any layering. But according to this subreddit "layering is necessary" because server technology just isn't what it was in 2004.
---
I guess you could count them? Or make note what the dressing room says the first choice is in case it doesn't start every value at 1 in-game.
---
Because he claims he swapped into the new layer because he ran into Orgrimmar. The reason that he swapped was because his friend invited him to group so he swapped to his friends layer.  
---
He ran into Orgrimmar at the time when the layering was going to swap and tricked everyone into thinking it was the zoning to org that caused it. Whereas it was the group invite that he had hidden from the original clip.
---
So is wall jumping a thing in classic?
---
He looks forward to it so much that an important 'addiction' of his daily life has become unimportant, which would not have happened if he didn't have something to look forward to. It's like going to the gym to train so you can eat chocolate cake more often.
---
It's not a binary decision though.  Why should we all want to steal names of any of them?  Just let them reserve early but only one name so they can't take XlegolasX or Leeroy
---
Blizzard was forced to take legal action against the creators of WoW Glider because Warden was useless against it. MDY Industries (Glider creators) were fined $6,000,000. The court also forbade them from releasing the source code. After that, botting in WoW has never been the same.
---
Warden might be better today, I don't know. But I do know that people used bots for BG's, fishing and whatnot long after Glider was shut down. So maybe it's still crap :).
---
I found it, thanks.
---
Think its golemagg (EU pvp)
---
Ok mr. shield weapon Reddit warrior
---
No, Blizzard added a timer to it after people whined about layer hopping.
---
That's the spellbatching

That could definitely be but it would be. I'm not sure what that has to do with Rogue leveling time now because it has changed completely since then.
---
I have a few lvl 120s thats have been floating the sky on their flying mount for a few months now i think.
---
Yea, they wouldn't advertise so heavily if they wanted/expected the game to fail.......
---
Last stess test before launch. This is what it's going to be. Or do you suppose they'll just radically change it to not suck all of a sudden and implement that untested? Cmon...
---
Why Eight?
---
Have you actually watched the guy play?  He is a grade A retard.  I've played with him on pservers in years past and ran in a few of his pug raids and it was clear he had no fkin clue what was going on.
---
[willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com) will have some
---
Shatterspear village, norteast Darkshore, reachable only by falling down through the mountains in Winterspring
---
"most", really?
---
Can you double check?
---
It's not much different as it's already on live - some addons (most) are on Curse, some are only on WoWInterface and some (few) are on other sources (such as github or in very rare cases on their own website, like TSM, ElvUI)
---
Willitclassic links to Curse or WoWI anyway, not like they host any addons.
---
Most of those in the "updated" category are links to Curse or WoWI, while those under "planned" often lead to the development website (github or similar).
---
Tiptac works fine on classic. Search tiptac quick fix on willitclassic
---
garbage trinket tbh
---
I’m pretty sure that layering is instant when you join a party.
---
Pretty much, anyone who wants to try to "hit it big" is going to play on a non-streamer server and start streaming to hope they tap into the lack of competition.
---
People are gonna be out levelling..
---
There is no "buy retail" anymore, the subscription on its own gets you everything except the latest expansion.
---
Might be biased bc i love orgrimmar, the arcitecture and vibe, but horde racials are preeeetty good.
---
its not instantaneous. Theres a delay confirmed by Blizz. This delay is shown in the vid and the original poster of the vid used it to mislead people in the other post and cause loads of uproar.
---
Well the odds of someone taking your name in the exact half minute you delete and recreate are very small, especially if you wait untill the initial rush is over.
---
Downloaded the ZIPs, extracted to a folder on my desktop, then copy+pasted them into the addon folder. A few didn't work but most did
---
Without sharding there would be long wait times to get into the server, and then when you'd actually get on it would be impossible to do quests.
---
I'm not sure which option is worse. Then again modern blizzard server architecture is much better than in classic.
---
I don't usually care for the steamer/community drama. But that clip called me out and challenged me. You think you can tell me what to do in wow cause you have a big following? You think you can make an entire server harass me because I happen to fight you? People can't feel safe to pvp on pvp realms in case they step on a streamer ego? Lets fucking destroy this guy.
---
&gt;They should release the game how it was originally. 
---
Were you around for vanilla launch?  It sure as fuck wasn't the hundreds of thousands of people straining at the gates Classic launch will be.  Starting areas weren't crowded, most of the world (including cities) were pretty dead, and populations gradually rose as the game gained popularity and more people heard about it.
---
Layering will replicate the original launch experience far more accurately than just letting everyone in.

We are a semi-hardcore raiding guild led by former CE raiders, seasoned GMs, and vanilla vets looking forward to progressing through classic. We're good humored people who know how to take and deal jokes while knowing when to get serious. We look to create a friendly community while pushing content and improving ourselves. We expect players within the guild to work towards the good of the group; to get the same respect that we give you. We're looking for like-minded individuals who are willing to conquer the challenges that classic throws at us and having a few laughs along the way.

Agreed, but still. Don't dally!
---
Will buying game time also work?
---
It's more about their company-wide culture of arrogance towards player suggestions as opposed to actively wanting the game to fail. 
---
That being said, I truly do believe that there are those at Blizzard who don't want Classic to do well
---
Yeah that's why I think they should only use layering for the lvl 1-12 zones. After that point, people will be super spread out and it wouldn't be necessary.

# &lt;Stay Hydrated&gt; |A|Herod| NA| EST| PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---
A group of 70+ players who have a deep passion for World of Warcraft. Some of us even meeting back in 2005 creating great friendships that have lasted 14+ years. Currently our roster is sitting at 50+ dedicated members who are active on discord or playing together on private servers to pass the time waiting for release.
---
We are looking for all players who want to be part of a Semi-Hardcore guild planning to be in the top 5 for our server to clear Naxxramas. This will mean raiding 2-3 times a week with attendance needing to be on the high side as well as knowledge of your class or willingness to learn to help us get over those hurdles on tough boss fights.
---
Raid Schedule for Phase 1:
---
Tuesday - 7-10pm EST (Molten Core)  
---
Wednesday - 7-10pm EST (Molten Core if not finished, Onyxia’s Lair)  
---
Monday - 7-10pm EST (Optional day if we need for Molten Core clears)
---
Our raiding philosophy is to have fun while staying focused and clearing content at a fast pace. Watching boss strategies, proving you understand the boss encounters and your role will be required to join raid groups as well as a minimum gear level with full enchants and consumables. Once those requirements have been met, mistakes won’t be punished, we’re here to laugh, to cry, to kill and get killed by bosses as a team.
---
Loot will be Loot Council based:
---
We will be keeping track of attendance as well as amounts of gear acquired.  
---
Loot will be dealt with a couple things in mind by our council members:
---
How has this person contributed to the guild?  
---
Does this person show up on time and regularly to raids?  
---
Does this person know their class and perform?  
---
Who will this piece of gear benefit the most to help the guild as a whole?
---
Currently recruiting every class besides fury warriors.
---
Please add me on discord @Smalls#5019 for more information!
---
the starting zones were weird. at first there were so many people for the first 2 or 3 levels and then everyone seemingly disapeared
---
It just makes it easier to find an camp them.
---
Does it bother anyone else that green shirt dude is pressing the mouse pad to click on refresh.
---
15k concurrent players you're thinking. Classic concurrent will probably be in the 3k range, similar to vanilla. 15k would be 5 servers .. judging by Blizzard's server numbers, if this is a drop, they're thinking of a pipette, not a bucket.
---
I think they will add some servers after 1 day or less just after launch, if the servers will be overcrowded.
---
What? Layering doesn't exist in any of those.
---
You're thinking of phasing (which didn't even come out until WoTLK) and sharding's behaviour, which layering has been specifically advertised as not replicating.
---
Didn't you just complain about people arguing when they have no idea how something works? What do you think layering is?
---
Why the fuck would they care if people are playing retail or classic, they get their sub fee either way
---
No way lmao
---
Yeah that’s about fucking dumb, hunters will be in the gajillions... yeah that’s a number
---
It has never worked like that
---
Yes! I was wondering if this is where it was. I only ever saw it in YouTube videos. Got a new goal with Classic!
---
And then you get dead servers after a couple weeks once populations taper off.
---
This has to be fixed on launch. Parties / Groups should automatically be on same layer
---
Yeah
---
Personally I prefer undead but troll is 100% viable for pvp, if you are only pvping imo go undead but if you do any pve at all go troll.
---
Nah I downloaded Details but disabled it without testing it out, I won't even have it open until BRD or later, so I figured it was pointless to test it and set it up
---
You are right my friend. Without trying nothing happen. Also RP-PVP Servers they changed their minds.
---
But that was recently (both changing minds and asking for it)
---
Layering has been asked to be changed/removed for a Long time but they won't do it. So far at least. With a huge amount of very good ideas (probably a few better than yours - or at least more written out/thought out than yours currently) and still no Response and or Change. 
---
But you are right. I'm just being pessimistic (if that is actually a word) and shouldn't be we are all one community that want the best for the game!!
---
So I hope you will be heard and everything can be changed within 2 weeks... I start sounding pessimistic again! :D
---
Good luck my friend!
---
what a dumb post. "i lt didn't happen to me, so all you victims must be lying and are disturbing my peace." fuck off selfish prick.
---
I heard they were going Golemagg?
---
That's beside the point.
---
This is a **wonderful** post.  Quality info that over the course of 15 years I forgot about.  Thank you friend!

#  [H][NA][PvP/PvE] Looking for Casual - Moderate Intensity Guild for PVE and PVP
---
Hello all, I am Vanrustic and I am looking for a guild.
---
My  background: I am an experienced player and have been playing since late  vanilla (barely reached 60 before BC). I played WoW heavily and was a  fairly hardcore raider during BC/WotLK/Cata but quit at the panda  expansion because of family life. I have returned to BFA  and had a  decent time with it. In classic i played an undead rogue, but in BC i  mained paladin. Additionally i suffered from Alt-aholic syndrome both  during Burning Crusade and WotLK. I have played every class (excluding  demon hunter) to the maximum level of 80. Through this time i was able  to find out exactly what i like and what classes suit my style. the  other thing i have learned from being a recovering alt-aholic is how  valuble time is and how one can get more out of the game from  concentrating on one or two characters instead of 6 or 8.
---
**My intended character/role/Professions**\-  After careful consideration I will be rolling a shaman. I played some  shaman in BC and i currently main my shaman in BFA. I have been a  healing main in raids ever since Burning Crusades (the first expansion i  actually did endgame content) and in continued to do so today. While I  level i'm intending to utilize the 30/0/21 Ele/Resto pvp spec so i can  do some dungeon healing while not crippling myself leveling (and not  wasting all my money on respecing). as for Professions i intend to be an  Herbalist/Alchemist. I also intend to have a bank alt who is a tailor /  enchanter.
---
**My experience in guilds**  \- I have been in a few guilds in the past, I tend not to flip around  because i'm not that intense about the game. But when I was hardcore  raiding I had risen to the rank of a Guild officer, Class  leader(paladin), and Heal leader. (Paladin healer at the time) I have  experience advising other players on talent choosing, stat priorities, I  advise the raid leaders on healer placements, orgonize buffs among  healers, and i have some light experience with Leading raids(not very  good, but can do it).
---
**My intended schedule**  \- I have a full time job, family, and I am constantly studying for  industrial certifications and other things. I have a set schedule for at  a minimum 1 day per week of play time but that might change when  classic comes out (I'm graduating from my masters program a few days  before release....coincidence?) I can be flexable to change what day  that will be but once it is changed I need to stick with it.
---
**Other information**  \- I will be playing most of my time with my IRL friend who intendeds to  roll a hunter. He is the one who convinced me to play during vanilla  and continiued to play while i quit. If there is a slot for him as well  that would be best. He is a fully capable raider and can contribute  greatly to the guild with both knowledge and experience.

Should be able to any time between tonight and launch.
---
BGs are x-realm on launch.
---
I mean, I don't want to see people disapear just because they log out.  Why can't everyone's offline, lifeless body just persist throughout perpetuity at all times?
---
It's still the case, according to Blizzard.
---
I left one hanging out by the spider cave in deathknell and the other one is in Razor Hill
---
Noticeable difference?
---
Because of the huge controversy surrounding Streamer servers and lack of LATAM/BR servers, we are currently on hold to make a decision on it. 
---
However, it will be between Faerlina and Herod (Horde - PVP East) depending on which has the least mainstream streamers.
---
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
---
This is what I needed to get me through my workday. So wholesome! Do you need friends? :)
---
sadly this is what we are going to get, they wont change anything
---
Its a shield not a weapon. You dont meele mobs with a shield to train your shield weapon skill.
---
Good spot for alliance mages to aoe farm ;)
---
Yeah, you *remember* this - but literally no one else, including all databases on the internet do. You can even read about the introduction of phasing in TBC, which was born from a bug fix to a quest related to SSO rep.
---
Private servers have "zone-sharding" or "phasing borders", intentionally created to improve performance - there's plenty of private servers that do not include it.
---
Once again, before you actually take the L - what do you think layering is? Try to describe the concept to me.
---
I'm thankful that Asmongold is a douchebucket and that his followers are also douchebuckets, because it will remove most of the douchebuckets from the other servers, making my server a much better place to play on.
---
Nobody made a video to try to discredit him.  It was more a joke on Ret paladin priority when they were discussion their loot rules for their DKP w/ class priority.
---
C'est toi qui a l'air d'un "attardé puceau" en insultant un vrai. Pathétique mangeur de soja
---
Just need to get to LVL 15 on horde and then spam dungeons to level. I bet 90% of streamers do this. Will still be hard to run to new dungeons though
---
So you never noticed the people you never saw because they were on another layer wow tell me more
---
I would honestly be surprised if there was a noticeable difference.
---
I hate layering and sharding, it is fucking bullshit esp. on pvp servers BUT since my time is very limited now to a 2-3h max in the evening I'd still rather take layering than queues.
---
That's so painfully not what it looks like.
---
sure, keep the circlejerk and hate threads going and see where that gets ya. all you guys are achieving is making him and soda more salty and more likely to fuck you over at the last second
---
Can't speak for OP, but there were quite a few 4:49 range 1-15's on launch.
---
If you're hitting 5-6h to 15 and you are focused on time you are fine though. I had no issues tagging myself.
---
To be fair, all classes except druid(and maybe hunters for raiding) are good
---
I too had no issues, leveled up multiple characters just fine. Felt like old Wow to me.
---
ive been playing on stormscale since tbc so playing with Scandinavians is non issue quite the opposite in fact
---
I'm the same way. I enjoy the idea of world pvp, but a lot of my buddies are going pve so that's what I'm doing. 
---
Do you join /world defence channel to see if someone from the other faction is 'flagged' for pvp?
---
Honestly I’m not sure what will be worse, the current shit posts or the upcoming tidal wave of “look I just made a character” screenshots at launch
---
&gt; Right...so nothing there says what you say it says.
---
"At that point it stops being PvP and becomes harassment. We'd want to hear about it and would, at the very least, look into the matter." 
---
After looking into the matter and determining harassment, would they not take action?
---
And no one could show you were this was directly applied, since they never share that kinda info, but many have been banned for harassment.
---
Getting your shit opinions absolutely decimated and then acting like a troll?
---
You really are pathetic.
---
My guild and I are going to Thalnos. No streamers, the br community has been really friendly, the guilds have said they will be speaking English. Realistically will be a minority 3-5% of the server population tops. It's going to be a great server even though everyone blows it way out of proportion lol
---
2 days ago, on stress test servers, since it was open the whole weekend
---
&gt; How an adult man in his twenties manages to literally sound like an entitled 8 year old shit is beyond me.
---
there's a name for that: manchild who never had a job.
---
Testing things on the stress test? No way!
---
Yeah the most recent stress test had like a 30-45 min que and that was pretty much directed only at the EU guys because of the timeslot.
---
The 3 NA PvP servers are going to get fucking bent on launch.
---
&gt; the argument has always been that layering is better than server merges and the like down the road
---
And that argument is absolutely ridiculous and I wish people would stop stating this. Merges are significantly less damaging than layering.
---
Thanks for wasting my time
---
if you care about pvp, go to pvp server. PVE servers are for people who dont care about PVP.
---
"Raiding towns will get pretty boring" - its much more likely that there wont be ANY raiding towns on pve servers. Or very little of.
---
There also will be barely any - if at all - world pvp on pve servers. 
---
Once again, whole point of PVE servers is for people who dont like / care about / want PVP. So going to pve servers and expecting pvp is a bit... weird :p
---
Thats part of why i played a pally in the stress test.  I did a priest a couple months back (or a touch less than that?) for one of the stress tests, but i didnt want to 'ruin it' with this test being so close to launch.
---
What it always devolves into :T
---
/shrug. I'm happy with it ATM. Hoping for the best.
---
You say “what is this weird hate for streamers” and then you clearly define the reason for the hate. It’s their communities and the 40+ minions following them around all over the place.
---
Well it's not a realistic scenario. I'd know that me personally switching has basically no impact on whether or not layering would be disabled. I would do whatever the people I'm playing with want to do
---
Could always put up a vod after.
---
&gt;Because classic will keep the attention of modern gamers. 
---
Don’t kid yourself. Most people will play classic for a week then never touch it again. Blizzard understands this which is why they use layering. And yes, actual Vanilla had a fuck ton of dead servers.
---
Look for lots of beer and girls without bra's. There you will find the Czech guys. Bless that country.
---
How does that work with the layering cooldown and how does they layering cooldown work when your automatically forces into a new layer for wtv reason... so many questions still unanswered..
---
Can confirm it doesn't work with friends. Me and my brother was going to duo level during the stress test so we made new characters and logged in at the same time and got put into different layers, leaving/remaking group didn't work either so we had to relog.
---
I absolutely am worried about streamers. Ive seen tiny streamers on private servers dominate the entire population with mega guilds etc. I'm not about that.
---
if only that were true. the guy has serious mythic raiders in his pugs all the time. also he will have a bunch of pvp personalities in his guild too
---
I still remember the first hour of the stress test, where everyone hated blizzard with a fiery passion.  Then 6 hours later no one even mentioned the queues.
---
It's a fair point, but a different one to what everyone was getting really angry about in the other thread. Layering is continent wide and doesn't phase people in or out when you go into cities, no matter what the OP was trying to imply with the edited clip.
---
If you are a bad player who doesn't enjoy having fun and some rivalry, go for pve! ;)
---
I will never understand why you would want to play on pve on a mmorpg, especially wow classic and tbc
---
No it doesnt increase servers capacity read what /u/minisynn typed and you'll understand.
---
Leveling takes a long time but you will be 60 longer than you are leveling most likely. It also won’t affect many zones, as pvp only occurs in contested zones.
---
**&lt;ZANCOR&gt;[HORDE][FAIRBANKS-PVP][SEMI-HARDCORE][PST]**
---
Ladies, gentlemen, trolls, orcs, demons, whathaveyous...We are Zancor Gaming, a newly formed gaming community that is itching to hit up the glory days of classic WoW in full force. We are a dedicated bunch looking to push top tier end game content and have a blast while doing so. Who knows ...maybe you’ll make a few lifelong friends along the way. We’re about having fun, meeting new people, and kicking ass. Our player base mainly comprises of individuals between 25-32 years of age with a variety of gameplay experience.
---
We welcome both battle hardened Warcraft players and those who are just joining our world. We foster an atmosphere of teaching those who are learning and doing their best every time they show up, if we’re not improving, then we’re not doing our job.
---
**Who are you folks looking for?**
---
First and foremost ...we’re a raiding guild. This means we eat, sleep, and dream PVE and dragon slaying strategies. We’re not super hardcore raiders pulling long hours into the night, but we aren’t for the faint of heart either. We will test your mettle and push you to become the best WoW player you can be. We ask that our members maintain a positive attitude and keep their eye on the prize, slaying bosses. New players can be molded into great raiders, but great attitudes can be hard to come by, we don’t care if you’re new to classic, as long as you’ve got a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Do not be afraid to ask questions, today's students may be tomorrow's masters.
---
**Raid times?**
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday **8:30pm-11:00pm PST**.
---
Monday(Optional cleanup AKA “The Chungus Raid”) **8:30pm-10:30pm PST**
---
*3 Day lockout raid scheduling will be determined closer to the phase 2 patch.*
---
**What are your expectations?**
---
We expect our members to conduct themselves appropriately both in guild level chats as well as in public. Our members represent our guild to the public and each one should show nothing but respect and understanding to the general player community. Friendly ribbing is fine, but please keep it ToS friendly...we don’t need our friends being banned!
---
We also expect high raid attendance with minimal tardiness. Real life happens, we get it, if you need to miss a raid just let someone know before we start forming and you’ll be excused with no penalty. When we start forming, we expect raiders to come prepared with consumes, enchants, buffs(World buffs not required), and knowledge of our boss strategies. Failure to do so could result in a loss of EP for that specific raid being run. Our goal is to get our first raid up by week 3 or 4 of release, we’re not expecting everyone to bend over backwards and get to 60 and get geared up by week 1, but if you want to, you’ll have some buds to play with along the way.
---
*We also expect clear comms on boss attempts, call outs and communication are key when there are forty raiders in one channel. Banter and whatever else is fine during trash, but we expect to move through content like we’ve done this before… Because we have.*
---
**How about the loot system?**
---
We will be using EPGP with a whitelist. The whitelist is for items such as legendaries, certain BiS items, and tier set completions, when those instances arise, the loot council will make the decision of who gets what. The loot council consists of Officers/Class Leaders, and 3 raiders picked randomly each week to represent their fellow raiders, the GM will step in to break any ties.
---
Raiders can bonus EP each week for showing up early, with world buffs, and by contributing raid mats to the guild bank.
---
**That sounds great! Where can I sign up?**
---
You can start with telling us a little about yourself [here!](https://forms.gle/cRucWvvKFSCrFDCb9)
---
You can also visit our discord if you have any questions. You can find that [here](https://discord.gg/73nsMgh)
---
Haha hey guys killer dude here I made a meme for you guys to enjoy I love memes haha alright see ya later
---
-killerdude signing out
---
So true. I'll probably make another warrior even though I still play my original warrior on retail...
---
If making that game on a shoestring budget since the assets and design are already done and the making of that game helps you legally protect their IP, yes they damn well would make a game they don't want people to play.
---
&gt; spreadsheet
---
we really classic now
---
Thanks bud. Just saw this after I replied to one of your other comments relating to this.
---
BM is king for leveling, just turn off your pets growl when in dungeons and you'll be fine. Once you hit 60 Marksmanship will be the goto spec for raids and dungeons.
---
Please remember folks; Scrype, the number one raid leader and tactician in the world is from Turkey. It doesn't matter where people are from, judge them on what they do, not the colors on the flag.
---
Rather not have 50 threads flooding the sub because every individual things their personal take in an existing discussion deserves a new thread. The general policy is good.
---
Imagine being so pathetically envious. ''Legend'' for trying to ruin others' experience btw.
---
Hey guys look, somebody that doesn’t understand layering.....once again. Imagine my shock
---
Don't listen to these people that say to pick the three you like the most.
---
Is say pick the three that have the greatest chance of being taken by someone else. You might love the name TotallyNotThex but if nobody else will take it there's no reason to waste a reserve on it.
---
The smart play is probably to reserve your two favorite and then the one of the others that had the greatest chance of being stolen.
---
I created a dwarf (in the stress test) and ran to Ironforge to meet with guildies I haven't played together with for about 11 years.
---
The first thing I see when I get there standing right next to the dot indicating a party member on the mini-map? No one. Literally no one. Not only I didn't see my former guildies, I didn't see anyone else. Only after phasing to their layer (by grouping) I got to see them and /hi and /dance.
---
It wouldn't be pointless you are correct but it wouldn't be super helpful either.
---
Doesn't it make sense layering works how I described it though? If it doesn't there just straight up aren't even close to enough severs to meet demand.
---
According to the link in my OP ('source') that is not true.
---
I thought we didn't like streamers because of their communities, not because of the streamers themselves.
---
This is targeted against streamers themselves, not their communities. I also don't see how streamsniping and ganking the streamer is much better than following the streamer around and spamming nonsense.
---
Why again is this a good thing?

Have the names you want in a text editor, you can copy your “top name” into clipboard and literally: create Character -&gt; Control+V -&gt; create (or apply) 
---
It takes less than a second if you’re fast.
---
Well it's designed so you wouldn't notice it if playing solo. Try meeting up with 10+ people and you will start to see why layering is so damaging to the sense of community.
---
&gt; Any advice? 
---
Play on a pvp realm, It's super fun. Sure, it is frustrating and unfair most of the time and it will slow down leveling, but that's mainly because you waste of lot of time having fun with world pvp.
---
True, gotta make em die to mobs so they get a durability hit on top of the corpse run
---
servers work very differently now tho. you have phasing, sharding and cross-realm shit all the time. in classic all we'll have is layering and only for awhile. having said that, I agree that this sub is blowing this out of proportion.
---
You are very very wrong.
---
In a real server, without layering, there is an excellent chance you will NEVER even see Prince Nazjak spawn after days of trying. This is very discouraging. The only way to farm him is to check over and over every couple of hours, basically forever. You can't sit and spend an hour looking for him, because he is either alive or not.
---
On a server with layers, you can actually farm for him. You can search through dozens of layers, basically spend hours at it. The odds of finding him up is significantly higher.
---
The additional players on the server are irrelevant, because the supply is generally ZERO either way. Most of the time, he isn't up. But the difference is in the layering scenario, you get dozens of chances to find him, while in the real server you get only one chance. It's very discouraging, while layering it just feels like you need to work harder because you can put as much effort into it as you want.
---
Now, mathematically, the number of drops per player is roughly the same with or without layer, but the end DISTRIBUTION is completely different. The dedication required to farm one on a non-layer server is immense, and requires tremendous patience or luck, as he he can only possible spawn every day or two. While farming him in the layer scenario is just a numbers game, the more time you are willing to spend the more likely you are to find him, since you realistically could see him spawn and hour of the day in one layer or another.
---
I keep wondering the same thing.  How many times over the years have we seen them on random variants of names?  Or anyone that makes videos, pvp, etc.  Other than creating some sort of fake hype, I really don't see the big deal revolving around this server choice / name reserve things for the streamers.
---
And it will be really spammy, probably most by ads.
---
Should be able to yes, though many common or highly desirable names will be gone.
---
&gt;I don't see how you can say layering would not effect me in the story I told. There have been many posts and clips and videos made showing players shifting into different channels when they group up or even randomly. Like, shifting to a different layer than group mates. I might not have even met or helped him if I had been moved to a different layer.
---
I guess what you're misunderstanding about layering is that it's not affecting your layer. If you run into a warrior and shield him and heal him and group up layering has zero effect on it. You are already in his layer. So you will have the exact same interactions with people that you would without layering. The big difference is that there will be several layers of people all doing the same thing. You will miss seeing some people on your server but it's for a really limited time and is going to dramatically improve the player experience.
---
&gt;I leveled paladin, priest and warrior (though I didn't quite make it to 60 on my warrior). I get that they were overtuned, but I feel like it isn't an issue if you prepare properly and use the tools you have to your advantage.
---
You're not really getting the point here either. It's not that it was too hard to play it's that it was much harder than classic. The giant change in difficulty is a giant change it's impossible to not notice every second you're fighting something. That change is a much bigger effect since it is everywhere always as opposed to layering what you only notice occasionally with minimal consequences. I hope that better explains it to you
---
Is there a clear overview of what server will be chosen by streamers? Or any unofficial ones? EU looking for a normal English server
---
Ill add that to the post, thanks for pointing that out!

My guy the tribe in retail is a horde war party, and this was their stronghold lol

Sometimes I miss classic EverQuest. Instances literally did not exist until the 5th or 6th expansion. The first 3 years of the game was 100% instances and layers/shards were not a thing. All resources were shared, raid mobs, quest mobs, zones, everything. 
---
It mostly worked back then. Now a days though, I'm not sure that would go over well. The sheer amount of asshattery and rule lawyering that occured for raid mobs and contested spawns on emu servers like p99 and time locked progression servers is outrageous. 
---
I hope blizz is able to strike a balance.
---
This is honestly the worst possible thing I can imagine they would do to classic. The world and community is the #1 REASON we want to go back, and they've ruined it. Unbelievable.
---
Because there were already a bunch of existing threads about layering.
---
It's easier than you think, I think I was his first customer and traded 3 greens and about 40-60 linen cloth [for a wand and a white linen robe.](https://i.imgur.com/Hvajk9c.jpg) I was working under the impression that I wanted to level 2 level 15s during the test and that there was only 2 days of testing, thus getting rid of materials to boost my leveling ability was a no brainer to me.
---
I imagine he made a lot of money selling wands, robes, enchants and various other items. Even if he didn't... level 15+ quests can pay out 50 silver and world events like gurubashi, when not many people are actively trying to get them, earn you about 5g a pop.
---
The thing about that thread where someone showed ironforge in stress test vs nostalrious was like compairing apples to oranges tbh.
---
Nobody is in the cities in the stress test most of the times and the screenshot from nostalrious was from last day before server closed so ofc ppl would be in ironforge.
---
I saw the same amount of ppl in all of the starting zones. Layering might not be as bad as ppl think it is.
---
Thanks. Once I make my attempt to steal asmongold I will create my name x

---
I can say that I personally also had a very positive experience and did not notice any layering.  
---
That said, if *anybody* is having their experience diminished by it, it really should be removed.  It's not part of the original experience.
---
I'm honestly tired of the "that's not how it should work, it will get fixed" bullshit. This is how it has been working since the demo, and all through the Beta. This is what layering is.
---
Stop saying it's bugged.
---
Stop saying Blizzard should/are gonna fix it.
---
We're 2 weeks before release on a game that took years to develop. I promise whatever you see now is what we'll see in game.
---
/r/classicwow took the bait.
---
Does everyone really think their names are going to be THAT popular? I'd rather save 2 weeks of game time, and pick a character after more of the server details are concrete. 
---
Hell, even in my group of friends we have switched 3 servers and two factions over the past day.

Is re specing in game expensive to go from BM to Marksman?

NA - Horde - Most likely going Herod but also willing to go Thalnos if I can find a guild there.
---
Looking for a raiding guild and have availability any weekdays from 6:30pm-12am EST. Planning on playing a Warlock, and have played since Vanilla with small breaks here and there. Also would like to do some PvP, but my main focus will be on raiding.
---
Server population issues were one of the biggest problems with Vanilla WoW.
---
It was a bit noticable to me but I'm not sure if it was because I played as soon as the RP-PVP server became available in the stress test. It was also the first time I played Classic and I wasn't used to the auto-loot looting the items 1 by 1 .
---
However I didn't have any problems with lag like I did with pservers.
---
the anti-streamer stans are becoming worse than the streamer stans...
---
Imagine being so insecure
---
The language thing is getting way overblown. SA populations are going to be a tiny minority on any server and the vast majority of them will speak English outside of their own guilds/parties because they'll have to. They don't want to be isolated from a big portion of the server anymore than you do (and it's going to be much worse for them given the population imbalance). Worst case scenario you might see a foreign language conversation pop up in a public channel once in a while, which has always been a thing in NA/English servers because a lot of people in NA speak a lot of different languages.
---
Oh nononono
---
Yes I am under the impression general chat is but trade chat is not layered. Here is why I believe this:
---
- during the elwynn raid last night I was in elwynn trying over and over to get a group and saw no one. I msg a horde I saw on esfands stream for a group invite and enter a new layer and instantly zone chat was flooded with comments.
---
-Frequentpy in trade chat I would sell something to people in trade and tell them to meet me at the auction house doors. They would not be able to meet me until we entered the same party.
---
Perhaps someone else can confirm.
---
The realms that Asmon and Soda are on will be entirely unplayable for anyone but his fans, it is an actual issue.
---
Might be, but I think some would contest that - either way, this is designed for LC based guilds, but if anyone running one of the various DKP systems wishes to use this, then they are more than welcome.
---
Pepega FORSAAAAAN
---
Awesome! Thank you! :D
---
Ya with layering and how much workload servers can handle these days, they can probably fit more people on to single servers, so when the hype players wash out you aren’t left with dead servers, and your small but dedicated community of subscribers remain.
---
I don't think anyone knows but I'd bet money that you couldn't. Just hop on the stress test before it shuts down, they have an east coast and a pacific server so it should be representative of what to expect. I'm in NY and I got 80ms average on pacific, 30ms average on east coast.
---
&gt; servers and merge them as needed during phase 2
---
You are so out of the loop!  Server merges are the worst thing that can happen, because it produces a lot of undesired consequences.  you have entire economies ruined, player's stockpiled goods become worthless, rare raiding recipes are now common because of raid progression differences.  People log out and never come back that would have continued playing because they loose all sense of community in their old server.  The drop off for subscribers on the servers is severe, and you can source all my time playing MMOs from the past or look into forums if you need more background information.  Finally, you have guild names and character names now tagged with their home server, because they are trying to accommodate everyone that is named Thex.  
---
Server merging is way, way worse than layering will be.  How many MMOs have you played so far where layering was able to kill it before the game took off?  What is your sources that layering is going to kill classic?  Come on man! Remain positive for fuck's sake!
---
You're correct up to "The additional players on the server are irrelevant", which is just insane. Vanilla servers hold what, 3k people? You honestly believe that on a server that holds *at least* 3-4 times as many total players depending on how Blizz is handling it, that you aren't going to have many many more people searching for him? Come on. The competition is going to be just as fierce, it's just going to be a different competition.
---
Occam's razor man, if it's going to be so easy to farm this thing, don't you think many more people are likely to try..?
---
I plan on starting up my WoW Sub for the first time since Vanilla today. The first time I notice layering. I will be cancelling it. If I never notice it, fine. If I never zone into an empty city, fine. But the first time I need to 'swap layers' I am done. 
---
I was shocked at how few servers there are, now I know why.
---
I guess I tried to ask if you got to relive one of them. Which would you choose
---
"I'll remember you fondly in therapy"

With rank 10, does /WorldDefense send Cross all layers?

Luckily I have a some names that wont get flagged, so im pretty safe. Doing it when I wake up in the morning, so around 8 hours after it comes online.

On the other hand, one of my names is Thex.

---
Yeah, to be fair that point is negligible. I only say more populated because it seems like people are more drawn to the name of the Server. 
---
In retrospect, both servers will be disgustingly overpopulated and I imagine Blizzard will add at least 1 more English PvP server within the first 3 months of release.
---
Make sure he’s not a hunter either
---
Oh come on, they can easily pre-plan that stuff.
---
&gt; server identity 
---
literally won't exist the entire time layering is around.
---
Layering is the easiest solution they can think of. It's absolutely not the best solution, it's not even an okay solution.
---
Use the search function.
---
wow this is game breaking
---
I dont think ganking will be so bad at launch.  Most people will want to level.  Picking fights is counter productive to leveling.
---
Two fucking streamers. The rest of them it won't even matter but every streamer is being treated like an asshole right now
---
hmm will the graphic overlay boss warner work again
---
I dont think it will be bad. There guilds have said they will be speaking English and for how many there are it's only 3-5% of the servers population. There will be far more Spanish then Portuguese rolling on the other est server.
---
wrong. i logged into both coast over the weekend from florida. 39 ping on EC. 69 ping on WC.
---
The point of classic is to get non-players (like me) to return, not to shuffle around their existing players.

Undercity Fight Club - NA - Faerlina - Horde

Hey guys, we’re a super casual guild that plans on clearing all content as it’s released, but aren’t dead set on a particular raiding day, but that’ll be determined based on what’s best for everyone once we hit 60. It’ll in all likelihood be one night on the weekend, I imagine between 6-10pm EST, but subject to change. We won’t penalize people for not attending, as we’re all adults and have life commitments, and we understand that. The loot system will be loot council, so the more time you put in, the more you’ll get out in return. In the beginning we’re just going to be focused on helping each other level, as that’s a part of the journey a lot of people aren’t giving enough attention to. recruiting all classes, and everyone regardless of what they’re interested in, whether it be PvP or PvE. Most of us will be PvP’ing regularly though, heavily focused on wPvP. We’ll be doing premade BG’s when they launch as well. We’re really wanting to just form a fun community, free of all the toxicity and other nonsense that’ll be coming along with this. We definitely are not the guild that kicks you or grills if you’re offline for more than 3 days. Come hang with us!

Discord: https://discord.gg/aq9adVb

Preplaned server groups that enforced unique namings that could be merged down the line absoultely was a better solution than layering. You can intelligently merge them when/if it becomes required. Meanwhile with layering, the only way layering works is if Classic experiences massive attrition. If Classic is even a minor success, and given the tiny number of servers Blizz is spinning up it doesn't need to be that successful, they won't be able to remove layering without making Nost look like a dead server.
---
If I didn't, I would have gotten accused of having ulterior motives! I do hope a few people will pick up the suggestion on looking up documentaries for it!
---
So you're telling me the 12 NA servers will only be able to house under 10k people people (probably closer to 5k if not less) each? So only 30-50k people will get to play? That just isn't how layering works my man.
---
typo my friend. It is and "and". Everyone is german in the groups searching in german language.
---
No, it's not..  
---
Health doesn't update instantly, and it didn't in vanilla either.  There used to be addons that would use combat log data in order to update it more quickly, but by default your client is waiting on the server to feed you that data which takes a noticeable amount of time.
---
You think they do, but they dont.
---
I think Ive missed something, I've always called it aubergine.

Kind of like what everyone on this sub is planning on doing to streamers? Lol...

Exiled [H] | NA (EST) - PVP | Wed/Fri/Sun 6-9:30 | Semi-hardcore | Loot council EPGP hybrid w/ decay + minimum
---
ABOUT US:
---
We are a mature group of men and women. Many of our members are returning seasoned WoW veterans, some experienced through AQ40 + Naxx in original vanilla, some through raids of the latter expansions, others were high rated RBG + arena junkies. Some people are new. Our top 45-50 players will be our core progression group. We will then start building our second 40 man raid. At the moment, we have 70+ confirmed members (not all of these players wish to raid with the core progression group - we still have room and whoever proves to be most competent the soonest will get the raid spot). Though we are a semi-hardcore guild, we aim to be one of the best on our server, keeping up with guilds that consider themselves "hardcore" and maintaining an active world presence. People will know exactly who we are.
---
We are a Raid first, PVP second guild, though have a very strong emphasis on PVP. We WILL be leading BG premades and world PVP raids on Alliance towns. We will create, join, or support our server's honor-cartel for those that are interested in PVP-only, once the honor system is introduced. You will find us dueling outside of Orgrimmar. We are looking for challengers. Bring your A-game :)
---
LOOT:
---
We will be using an EPGP/Loot Council hybrid with a minimum point requirement to obtain loot, along with a point-decay. Loot Council gets final say over gear distribution, though EPGP scores are heavily weighted. A random raid member will join Loot Council for the night by /rolling 1-40 at the start of every raid for that night only. 
---
RAID SCHEDULE: 
---
Wed 6:30-9:30EST, Fri 6:30-9EST, Sun 6-9EST
---
SERVER: TBD (Faerlina/Herod)
---
Please message me for more info
---
&gt;How do you know that layering Won't be like this at launch? The simple answer is that you don't.
---
Correct, I don't know.   
---
\&gt; Wouldn't it be nice if Blizzard Communicated with us   
---
Been wanting that for years. There is a reason I stopped playing retail.
---
I think the first re-specialization is 1 gold, and then increases to multiples of 5 gold for each time after that up to a maximum of 50 gold (5, 10, 15, etc...)
---
It does come back down slowly if you don't respec for a certain amount of time (my memory wants to say it's one month), but as I played a warrior back in Vanilla I was constantly respec-ing.
---
**LF1M Warrior to run melee dungeon cleave leveling group to 60**
---
**[Horde] [EST PvP or RP-PVP]**
---
Have 2 Warriors, 1 Druid, 1 Priest. 
---
14+ hour days, 10 am (CST) start, play till 12am with multiple breaks in between. Group decision to play later than that. We'll follow this schedule until 60 or the Monday after release. 
---
Haven't decided on a server yet but will be EST PVP or RP-PVP. We'll be following a pre-written dungeon leveling guide that includes some questing. No prior experience required, just be committed to the schedule and be a chill person. 
---
Let me know if you have any questions! Look forward to meeting and playing with you!
---
I was in the beta and th cities always felt busy and had people in them. Looked nothing like these photos, didn’t look like the Nos photos either though. World zones felt populated too.
---
The game fundamentally wasn't designed for that many players on one server. Like the actual gameplay wasn't designed for it. It was always ironic to me when people called Nost "blizzlike" but just ignored the population problem. Classic is intended to be a recreation of Vanilla. Not a recreation of Nost.
---
If memory serves, Blizzard are doing it to make sure people can even level.
---
Next up is printable forms, for those wanting to use pencils to track all this!
---
Dance on IF / OG mailbox
---

---
I'm surprised streamers don't get to log in early. Maybe that's because they're not special.
---
It's cute you think shareholders give a shit about the internals of blizzard. 
---
They show up pick up their cheque and say ok next time I want 50% more then leave.
---
Has Blizz confirmed you'll be able to log back in and delete, customize, and remake your character at a quiet hour? What if they remove login access?
---
I am in Western Canada and if server is in like Chicaco ill get a 30ms ping...but I was hoping they would have server names we could ping,  that will be the deciding factor for me
---
Automod incorrectly removed this for thinking this was "advertising a community or website"
---
Anyway here's the clip: https://gfycat.com/windingparallelbarebirdbat
---
The phase happened some 24-25 seconds after he received and accepted the invite. I never played on the classic beta or tests, can someone confirm or deny how long it generally takes to phase after party invites or joining a group?
---
We dont want the Spaniards. You have them.
---
It's cheap the first few times you do it, but gets more expensive the more you respec, so you only really want to do it once.
---
I thought you were trolling with a stealthed rogue.....because it took me awhile to find the warrior charging
---
Then instances wouldn't be possible
---
Please TLDR
---
I don't think people are Rush to 60 iot gank lowbies, theyre rushing to gear faster for raids:)
---
I think it’s more Reddit than Classic. 70% of Reddit is just bitching about stuff.
---
Dying from pvp on a pvp server will make you take like, what, 3 hours extra spread over the entire way to 60?
---
That's like 1% difference in leveling time if it takes you 10 days to get to 60.
---
Are you okay dude? Classic is chock full of RNG, that's one reason we love it.
---
Hmm. Do you also think it's great when the wealthy elite surpress the powerless poor? Pretty fuckin twisted mindset you have.
---
They are called microtransactions.
---
Yep. The hypocrisy in this sub is insane. The anti-streamer zerg is worse than the streamer zerg lol

The whole point of this thread was that they can do this with /world but NOT /lfg. Did you even read it?

Why the fuck would they have the privilege to do anything before the rest? What if me and some dude 10000miles apart share nick and say I get the name and he doesnt, thats fucking unfair as well giving this thought process.
---
Heck make classic unstreamable for 2 years and let us all lose ourselfs in this game again.
---
I'm almost certain all EST NA servers are in chicago, so just consult the time zones on the server list.
---
A real answer would be fishing :)
---
But how will I fear monger on reddit if Blizzard knows more than me?! Im not a big blizzard fan, but with how much they have listened to the community so far with Classic, I have a hard time not deferring to their expertise when it comes to things like Layering/Servers.
---
My husband and I played the stress test last night and honestly it was good for the soul. We haven’t had that much fun gaming together in a long while. Hell, I haven’t even picked up a game since my youngest was born (except phone games... which barely count).
---
Is rain not in retail??????     My.god.
---
It would be valid if people were trying to bring attention to breaking points in the system not push the idea that layering is bad because of the test.
---
It's not realistic since players won't keep playing in numbers that are so big we need layering. I.e. according to plan
---
then open up a bunch of free accounts and give them game time and reserve 3 per account.
---
Trading? buying cheap selling high sort of thing?
---
Good idea but I am not that familiar with the market value of items in classic as I never played before
---
I would guess it's in the same client as he stress test, just with different servers being open. There's already the option to download the classic client on battle.net.

Easy defense is, the joy of ganking large groups of followers. Get 10-20 people together, find the streamer, and his/her underleveled masses, and gank away! That's not targeting one player, it's targeting large groups for PvP fun!
---
What?
---
I was all set to roll a night elf warrior, thinking I’d outsmarted everyone and figured out a safer way to level a warrior, then I realized shadowmeld didn’t function as an aggro dump until way later.

I might still do it anyway since they look cool.

Knowing which layer you are on makes it easier to abuse.  Not worth

Historically, shields were often used offensively. That's why they often had a boss to strike an opponent.

While I agree with you it could still bring back a lot of players who quit WoW - it might get them to play retail again aswell
---
It ends in an hour, I wouldn’t worry about it too much

Unless you steal your NSA agent’s name

Sure that's more efficient but smoking rocks is more exciting.

Yeah... I’m not a fan of Asmon in the slightest, but I feel like people are being willfully ignorant to not recognize that this is sarcasm. The way he’s saying it, the inflection in his voice... yeah, it’s not genuine. The hate boner is pretty strong on this subreddit, kind of nuts.

Nobody cares about taliesin, you're fine.
---
Holy fuck who cares about the fucking names? Let them get their names because it’s part of branding for their livelyhood. Who gives a shit if they get to reserve their name 10 mins before you do?!
---
Thank you for this

I hope not too x)

How? We are amazing at video games :D

Because no one wants to walk around an elwynn forest with 12k people walking around..
---
If Blizzard does this I'm going to sue them in court. I'll lose horribly, but it will attract negative press, probably for both of us. I'm fine with that.
---
On YouTube there is a mage called Est doing it in around 6 hr 30 min.
---
&gt; Blizzard comes around a sabotages Classic in possibly the worst way you could ever imagine.
---
Ain't that the truth. They literally took the #1 most important part of Vanilla, you know, the thing everybody talks about and wants back, and they ruined it.
---
I would genuinely rather they add LFG and LFR to the game. I'd hate that too of course, but layering defeats the ENTIRE point of bringing back vanilla!

Constant stretching never hurts, keep it in mind during downtime such as flight points and reading quest text
---
what, you guys are starving? well im not hungry so stop crying and don't bother me.
---
I plan on having a main on pvp, but all of my alts on pve so I can just chill with them.
---
It's really not that big of a deal, just play a human.  
---
It only makes a huge difference to people pushing the game to it's limits, and since you're on the fence on it, you're clearly not going to do that, so it does not affect you.
---
He joined a group right before the video starts. It's layering.
---
Holy shit, now we want to make it a history lesson. Conversation is over friend.

Hahahahahahahahaha... Thank you for the laugh. But at the same time I feel sorry for you.
---
An undead who doesnt stand in fire and watches their threat will always do better than a troll who doesnt know wtf he's doing.
---
Decisions like which race to pick etc come into play at skill cap. They are for players who already play optimally, and need an extra edge. Unless you raid in a "we want to compete for realm first kills" kind of guild, just pick whichever race you want. Your decisions will affect your dps far more than your race.
---
What CPU do you have? The modern client is a lot more cpu intensive than the old one.

please educate me how am I obsessed with classic wow : ))))

I assume as long nobody takes it in between the time he deletes and you create yours
---
Only for beta, not the stress test
---
zoomer xXxShaZZraHxXx vs boomer Golemagg
---
Regarding fps, a question. I just went with default setting on the stress test and settings was capped at 60 fps. Should I change this? My screen is 60 hz I believe. Fps for me never dropped no matter how many players were in a zone. Would it run smoother not capped?
---
You pretty much just listed my go to addons.
---
I'm going to report every asshole who uses LFG to have random ass conversations rather than trying to fill a group.
---
In which case they'll open new servers which people will migrate to. Just like they have every time this has happened in the past. Just relax.
---
HOW DID HE KNOW????????
---
honestly, if you played on bleumaex in the stress test, you just had this exact test done to you.  The server went inoperable for an extended period.  Players flocked to another server, waited at the selection screen, did something else until their server was available again, or players gave up on the test all together.  It is simple and effective for getting a server population to the correct size to maintain a healthy experience for phase 2.
---
This is /r/classicwow, you're not allowed to be wrong about any minor wow factoids, no matter how minor they are. Everyone here is basically a walking WoWWiki archive from 2004, don't you know, and if you're not then you just can't hang.
---
Where do they advertise?
---
Blegh, one priest for every two five-mans. Healers with reliable rez are slightly less than 25% of the population for both factions.
---
Healers are going to be at a premium.
---
I'll donate €5 to your gofundme brother
---
That is a great idea...  I made a notepad for all the quests getting attuned, mats I need to farm for leveling leatherworking and for quest rewards / dungeon drops to seek out while leveling.
---
He joined a group right before the video started, he got layered into his group leads layer.
---
https://wowcenter.pl/
---
On my server it was mostly spammy with pug LFG, which most active players avoided like the plague, so they would leave that channel for players actually looking for group.
---
The real spamfest took place on the trade channel where everyone was idling.
---
It’s possible to delete and reuse name. There’s always a risk someone happens to use that name during the moments you’re creating the character and finalizing. Unless you happen to grab Thex or Legolas, I wouldn’t worry about it though.
---
No, 10-12x the amount of people, period. *It all scales*. Instead of having, say, one server of 3000 where 100 of those players are super hardcore and are rushing for charm, you've now got a server of, say, 12000 people (on 4 layers) where **400** of those players are super hardcore.
---
Same, I was young during vanilla so this time around I’m doing all the drugs! Well probably just weed, I’d love to get my hands on some lsd but that would make it pretty difficult to level lol
---
I'm with you OP. The conspiracy theories on here are nuts. Is Classic going to be perfect? No, and it would be impossible for it to meet every individual's definition of perfect anyway. But Blizz has demonstrated its commitment to making Classic as authentic as possible numerous times throughout the development process and has responded directly to community feedback.
---
Sweet, makes sense. Thanks for the info
---
Yeah me too, I’m actually so happy it’s playable at all. It’ll be a few months before I can afford to put together a capable machine and I should be close to level cap by then. No way I’ll be able to raid on this machine.
---
OP said this was also poses on the official forums
---
Names are not going to be saved.
---
Best way to reserve a name is to create a random appearance and name it, then come back some days later when the rush dies down, delete it and create it again properly.
---
I forgot WorldDefense required rank 10+ to speak. That's a pretty sweet perk.
---
Does anyone know if theres an addon that *just* adds the '!' to the minimap when youre near a questgiver?  I dont want something that shows it all on the world map, and im not even sure i want something that tells you which mobs to kill (like on retail, where it adds it to the tooltip).  Im just worried about not going in some random building and missing a quest when i was within 20 feet of the dude handing it out.
---
Yes. That is the point. You can then check every 30 hours. Maybe after 3000 hours (100 checks) he spawns, and you kill him. That is 125 days.
---
On the other hand, with layering, you can check layer by layer. Lets me conservative and assume you can only access 10 layers. That is still 10x as many checks per 30 hour period. Instead of 125 days, it's 12.5 days.
---
Now do you see the difference? Without layering, it's basically a lottory, and unless you get fantasicly lucky it will probably be months before you see him spawn. Heck, the trinket only has a 50% drop rate, so if you get unlucky you might need to kill him 3 or 4 times to see it drop, over a year of checking. With layering, you can farm it, and expect to see the rare at least every week or two. With equal luck, you will get the trinket in a month or less, even with terrible luck you can be pretty likely to get it in a couple months.
---
Ive heard liberals use projection a lot but good lord, 
---
You literally just pulled the grade school comeback "I know you are but what am I"
---
How does that make you feel? You truly are a sad little man, yes I am assuming your gender on purpose, just another thing to trigger you with.
---
That's what I thought would be the case! Awesome!
---
Retail wrath is why I unsubbed it was fucking terrible
---
I know. I'd love to play there but my whole guild is like 'hurr durr RP is for nerds'...like dude you're playing fucking wow vanilla you're already as big of a nerd as it gets lmao.
---
Classic is way smoother
---
&gt; I don't even care if i cant play the game for the first month.
---
If you don't care if you don't play for a month, then wait until layering is gone and sign up?
---
I said "a lot of players" not "the majority". But yes, maybe not a few weeks but a few months.
---
Ya well, having fury warriors doing twice the dps of some other dps classes/specs isn't vanilla either. In vanilla we had class balance patches every month so the metagame changed. Which was awesome. This is just a perpetual state of the same class disbalance. 
---
"This is not vanilla" is not an argument. Period.
---
There are 3 instances with balanced populations in order to meet the demands of the recent expansion launch. The zones aren’t designed to handle more than about a hundred people at a time. The instancing will be turned off soon, likely with the next content drop (5.1) in a month or two.
---
Just roll horde :)
---
Of course it matters... If you click to cast 50ms before the next batch, your spell will enter the batch if your ping is 40ms, but not if it is 80ms.
---
I haven’t actually tried that... what time do the servers stay up until? I’m at work for the next 7 hours
---
Awesome, thanks dude!

---
Theres an austria flag. I know we speak german. Just a joke.
---
That's the big issue, everyone gets FOMO seeing chat exploding with exciting things you can't interact with.
---
If you wanna play on EU you need to have an active sub on an EU account. An NA account will only get you on NA or OCE servers
---
Layered. He joined a group right before the video started, his layering cooldown came off as he entered org. The players didn't phase out when the org text popped up.
---
I've also just smoking weed with classic in mind. I know that once the game comes out that if I am still smoking I will do nothing but stay inside, play and get high. I've also started going to the gym basically to have a good lifestyle that once classic comes out I'll have an ok lifestyle not a shitty one, if that makes sense.
---
Being on reddit is like watching fox news.  Toy getting an EXTREMELY biased view of how the game is functioning.  These are rare occurrences that just get blown up because REEE LAYERING SUCKS.
---
Layering’s issues are very possibly exaggerated as long as it is removed relatively quickly. But even if it works perfectly, it just sucks a lot knowing there is a bunch of players near you that you can’t see or interact with.
---
Layering seemed pretty good for me. I only had one problem, and that was kiting a mob and it disappeared
---
Sure, if i knew for sure when that was i might.
---
There was an interview awhile back where they said they were lowering thresholds for layering as low as possible during points in beta to actually test its limits and see how it would break to better implement it and fix issues. Well its breaking during a, lo and behold, stress test, and everyone is losing their mind. If its like this during live then it will be a problem. But to me it seems like theyre testing their shit and making sure it actually works with 50k players at once.
---
Hey, at least you'll have a more "authentic" vanilla experience than most people if you do end up raiding in single digit frames!
---
I think i will look into the OmniCC and ClassicAuraCooldowns that sounds useful

We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule. We will not have a "one and done" mindset in regards to missing a raid. But no less than 90% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after.

---
I bet you loved it as well.
---
Also, you're going to be layered if you GET invited. You'll stay in your layer if you send the invite.
---
I think you're severely overestimating how prevalent layers are going to be after the initial launch. Concurrent players will be way lower, and the layering threshold that we see on the stress tests is not what its going to be like on live. People are freaking out about a stress test.
---
&gt; This layering issue essentially kills, straight up murders much of the community and classic atmosphere. Here we were focused on having all the little technical bits true to form of vanilla and then Blizzard comes around a sabotages Classic in possibly the worst way you could ever imagine.
---
One of my comments above was absolutely nuked for talking about this. Player permanence is one of the absolute pillars of what makes Classic... Classic
---
Oh look, a fear mongering conspiracy theorist. Your post history is hilarious, btw. Keep up the fight!
---
MEDIOCRE GRASP OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE?
---
Yeah, that's accurate.
---
This would mean you literally cant play with or get to know anyone in your server group until they're merged. It's like when your town with 3 middle schools send all the kids to the same high school, and you barely know anyone. It'd basically be a different server.
---
Also, this wouldn't give you much flexibility, as you can only merge them or not merge them, effectively doubling the player density or not. Whatever drop in players that layering can account for is infinitely more flexible since it can maintain the same levels of player density, rather than having massive spikes which completely change the feel of the server.
---
You're lying to yourself if you think there's a perfect alternative to layering.
---
Actually Vanilla servers were able to dynamically scale up to 4,000...but typically they kept it "soft-locked" at 3,500.
---
I did make the three gear sets for dagger Rogues, but they're the same as the sword Rogue stuff with only the weapon changed. I also have lists for main hand and off-hand daggers based off what I found on ShadowPanther.net.
---
Pro tip: Have a shit name nobody wants
---
Yeah but on my way to lvl 60 I might get layered at a bad time once or twice and I'll need to relog.
---
I demand 8 hour queues and dead realms in 6 months instead.
---
And then when they merge dead realms I'll complain about "destroying the community feel"
---
I don't know if I want more then two pvp servers. Already on live pvp servers are faction dominant. Not sure if I want to roll the dice just to have world pvp be horrible and one sided because a large group of alliance pvp players all moved to one server while all horde players are on the one I am.
---
you forgot a swastika
---
I mean I don't have one from Vanilla. WotLK is actually fighting for 1st place in my 'favourite expansion' list :P
---
Hes gonna get griefed if he does, I'd wager. Up to him if he wants to deal with folks engaging in that.
---
If you ever want advice about getting bigger/stronger (not w steroids but the same principles apply), sent me a dm. I train people in general health/wellness and powerlifting. Best of luck to you man, keep on taking care of yourself. It only gets better.
---
My mistake buddy, the other poster confused me and someone replied explaining it.
---
As a scandi I'm curious why you would prefer us over spaniards. Some of us type almost exclusively in our own languages too, which can be pretty annoying. 
---
TBH I feel 10% of any non-anglo nationality is a bit much on an English server if they don't communicate in English.
---
streamers, by their definition, film everything they do.
---
Abusing game systems IS against the TOS. Said streamer is liable to be banned for doing that. It wouldnt surprise me in the least if Blizzard makes an example of the first streamer to do this--they had to qualms banning reckful when the game was much more popular.
---
I mean being useful in a raid is always appealing, and seeing yourself top 3 in damage is an easy way to see if you are pulling your weight I guess, so maybe it is to me, I'm not sure.
---
I think they go offline in 40 min, if I'm not mistake. 9:00 am PST/12:00 pm EST
---
Unfortunately that's really the only way to do it for people. Either 2 on the main server you want and 1 on a backup server, or 1 on 3 different servers. Be nice to actually get 3 names I want, but that's too risky.
---
You're right this is a huge problem with Blizz pretty much post Activition. Original Blizz built up a massive amount of gamer cred, we trusted them to do the right thing. They've basically burned through all of that in the last few years. Blizz needs to realize that players no longer have inherent faith in them to do the right thing and go back to communicating more.
---
"This kills the game for me" "if there's layering, I'm not playing" are common phrases in this sub.
---
Oooo yes I like this plan! I think we will go with that! :) Thank you, I will be a lot happier if there's a way for us to level from the start and not have to be in Durotar.
---
Looking to chill with the hottest dudes.
---
That's similar to a thought I had, though I thought it would be better to treat it more like the BDO servers.  So you can swap servers (in this case layers *only*), but the cooldown is 15 minutes (and changing characters doesn't get around it).
---
But it has its own problems that the 'community feel' people would take issue with... foremost, it's more distinct that you are only playing with a subset of your server, and layering is less dynamic and transparent because you remove the abstraction.
---
The thing is, it's no more or less immersive or community breaking than handling it automatically.
---
The other issue I see with doing it that way is the increased complexity for grouping with people who are not on your immediate layer.  It fails the KISS benchmark, and would probably frustrate more casual players that don't know any better.  The benefits over automatic layering aren't really that big either.
---
I really hope this is the case. That they can dynamically adjust layering without having to restart the server. I've been playing the stress test all weekend and all the capital cities were empty as fuck even though trade chat was bustling.
---
Sharding at the least keeps some areas populated like cities. This just makes wow a single player game where you get to see about a dozen people in cities
---
I don't get it. Who is this guy? He doesn't look Muslim at all.
---
Not for now. He will be blown into oblivion when they wipe that data.
---
The guy you just replied to is sporting what I like to call "toxic positivity"
---
Blizzard: "You think you do, but you don't"
---
Fanboys: "Blizzard knows more than you"
---
hey im in that pic! also its weird to see people making up a scenario where layers prevent this from happening when both horde and alliance had like 3 full raids
---
They want people to play retail and buy mounts, buy WoW tokens, do server transfers and name changes. If a big chunk of the player base jumped ship to Classic they'd lose all that. It's good old corporate greed, not "conspiracy theories".
---
I'm not really a "tech" guy. Playing at 40ms versus 80ms, will there be any major advantages for the 40ms player?
---
Woosh. It's pretty clear that this is a response to well known previous toxic streamer behavior as well as their actual plans to literally ruin the game for everyone in the future.
---
Yeah you will see in real time attacks on towns all over the world. If you see consistent attacks make your way there and the player will still be flagged. In fact a lot of players attack towns on purpose because they are looking for a fight. Some players will level flagged for pvp as well.
---
Sounds like a lie.
---
I Agree, but if you want to get the skins you need to click on the same time to get it  
---
If you loose 0.01sec, only one player get the loot, so if it's "normal" even if you don't click together in the same time, you get it but now you can't.  
---
I have 16ms and he have 17ms, it's not a latency issue.
---
Maybe they'd rather not release specifics so it's less likely to plan abuse?
---
Just go with it. Stop being a h8ter and stop being jelly and just follow Asmongold around like everyone else. You might even enjoy it! I am sure some will invite you to the Asmon layer, if you just keep asking.
---
i heard this too - provided the login server is up.
---
if you can see the realm select window (which might show servers, which are offline) you can wait there, and they'll pop up as they get online.
---
but this is from some youtuber who claimed to have been a competitive leveller for server first etc. 
---
he said he did it like that.
---
Welcome to real WoW.
---
When you feel progressing step by step
---
It still blows my mind how few servers were announced. They can add more later, but wtf. Makes it look like they have absolutely no faith the game will be a success.
---
it would be extremely smart to leave it open until launch, lessens the struggle of 39 billion that missed today trying in 2 weeks at the same time
---
It's more of an example of the community not having a clue about the technical, business, or design side of the game.
---
Priest would have to share gear with them so might not be optimal. Between pally and druid I wouldn't say one is much better than the other, both are pretty durable, have buffs, etc. I'd say play what you think is the most fun.
---
Eh? I started french classes in school at age 4, spanish introduced at 11 and never had an option for German. Still know no French though
---
I am in a similar boat, I love raiding and playing end game stuff but I’m in no rush especially with a kid now and stuff. Probably be playing 9-12 EST once it kicks off but the days will vary
---
**Q: How long will name reservation be up? Can I reserve a name a day befor launch aswell?**
---
Also worth adding those zones get people up to around level 20 (or higher in the case of The Barrens), which allows people to run instanced content if the overworld feels too crowded.
---
Well, using an è or ô sometimes helps as well to still get a name as close to the original as possible.
---
To avoid all the name conflict issues it is easier to start small then offer free transfers to new realms to escape crowded ones.
---
do you know on which game we'll have to do that ? because when I launch wow classic I'm still on the stresstest
---
Blizzard: We won\`t fix bugs that were in 1.12. We want to keep the authentic experience.
---
Also Blizzard: We will keep layering until phase 1 to destroy the economy to keep the authentic experience.
---
Sadly this will be the one post blizzard references when they say how much the community wants layering. It needs to be buried.

Around mid Molten Core my fury/prot hybrid was easily outpacing well geared rogues and most casters.  And I am a keyboard turning button masher... I'm decent at the game but not exactly pro-tour material.  There is a reason 30% of the game is warriors.  They are wrecking machines.  
---
Leveling them, however... :(
---
I was with you in not wanting to give into the newer graphics and purely go with "Classic" settings but damn! You can mix the Classic graphics with newer and it's really nice. The extra ground clutter is awesome but you can also change the shadows/water quality to make it more like Vanilla. Great hybrid.

Sorry I asked this to someone else too but I’m curious, is there no way to just manually select which layer, so we can all be on the same one? In 2004 from what I read you were locked to one server so one single world, I feel like it will be very odd not seeing my friends when I know they should be in front of me.

IIRC The average age back in vanilla was actually around 26.

Oh the irony..

Imagine people spamming for help because horde raid at westfall. You get to westfall and there's no horde. Sounds fun right?
---
Might be a bold prediction, but I bet layering comes to retail at some point. They spent all this time on it and it's a feature they have talked about a ton ever since announcing the feature. Also no way they work on this new tech and spend so much time fixing it for only 3weeks of use. I bet it stays in use for awhile or again moves over to retail sometime after being dropped from classic. 
---
I would prefer no layering, but really I think it's significantly better than the phasing and CRZ that retail has atm.
---
I have a feeling this was on purpose.
---
All there are good, priest shares a gear type with both so not ideal
---
so go with what gels with you more pally or druid
---
Pretty sure launching Classic confirms that they don't know more.
---
You're asking for wine during a zombie apocalypse.
---
Exactly !
---
So should we create our real character or human Warrior? 
---
I always thought if you deleted you had time to create.
---
Will it be.open tomorrow to name? Or like literally only a few hour period and then locked for two weeks?
---
This is what I was trying to say. This means in PvP you could essentially cast at the same time but not get your spell off at the same time because of latency + batching right?
---
But is this a common occurrence? Would raid damage suffer?
---
After having played a while on Light's Hope, with 10k players ranging from 1-60 at any given time, leveling zones were still wildly overpopulated. That's why they increased spawn rates drastically, and quest spawns were extremely annoying to get. We're talking a few hundred in any given leveling zone, and alterations had to be made to accommodate. Now we're talking about a few thousand, all starting fresh in the same 4-ish zones (for each race). It would be an absolute shitshow. Crashes, unavailability of mobs, quest pickups being nigh impossible to grab. People would quit within a couple of hours, and those who remained would level painstakingly slow.
---
ok. thanks for this comment.  have a good one.
---
What level fishing do you need for the area?
---
Here's an idea: remove layering.
---
Take a look at what [Berserking](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20554/berserking) actually does.  You get 10% increase to cast speed for 10 seconds if you are not "badly hurt"  or &lt;40% health.  Frost bolt with talents is 2.5 sec cast time so in 10 seconds you are going to get 1/2 a cast off extra with berserking activated every 3 minutes.   Over the course of a raid night it will help you inch your way up the meter.  
---
IMO will of the forsaken is much better if you are going to pvp at all because you can don't have to equip a pvp trinket
---
Stress test ends in half an hour, you will make the character on the same client as the stress test
---
It is possible, companies have failed intentionately in the past. And of course, like any big company, ActiBlizzard has people at the top who are only “in it for the money”.
---
That said i think we send of a negative message to the developers and the community at large by being so negative without any proof.
---
ActiBlizzard has heir most profitable year in history while simoultanelusly firing 700+ employees. Layers are a budget solution.
---
And if it will be succesful, don’t worry, they’ll bring back microtransactions and new expansions.
---
That wasn't the point being made above, but no, I don't want to do that. I'm not *going* to do that personally because it sounds boring, but so does swimming in circles for 12 hours on one server. The people who want that charm are getting it one way or another. The "vanilla wow experience" is already not what it was in 2004-6 because people now know what tidal charm is, how powerful it is, who drops it, where he spawns, and how often, *from day 1*. The "experience" you're seeking doesn't exist anymore, as sad as that may be, it's impossible.
---
what?....
---
The big streamers have their names already reserved for them.
---
remember if you're on an RP server... you cannot have a name that consists of different words..
---
&gt;Examples of common unacceptable or disruptive RP names include (but are not limited to):
---
    &gt;Non-medieval or non-fantasy names (For example: Slipnslide, Robotman, Technotron)
---
    &gt;Names that reference well known people, characters, brands, places, or icons (For example: Britneyspears, Austinpowers, Mcdonalds, Georgewashington, Newyork)
---
    &gt;Names that consist of multiple words (For example: Inyourface, Welovebeef, Howareyou, Sixtyseventy)
---
Yeah you're definitely right for the name reservation phase, but I was wondering if something changes once the servers go live.
---
In the meantime I also found information that the 30 day lock only occurs on characters &gt;Level 30, so I feel pretty safe to make name reservations for a different account :)
---
Indeed, should be at midnight for us
---
Its legit explained in the FAQ?
---
so i have to stay up until 1am to reserve my name? thats fucked up
---
Why are you replying to me then?
---
With that logic people can't comlain about anythig, genious! Tell blizzard so they can ad a cash shop and be right.
---
Me and my little zergling are going to explore the world of Azeroth again :) I am so excited!
---
You're mistaking layering for sharding. The later was actually scraped for the former because this subreddit complained about it :\^)
---
I don't think anyone said it's a bad thing, but it's certainly a significant change from vanilla.
---
They should update the realm list when it's almost time \^\^
---
Are you referring to the staff? That quest doesn't require you to beat the escort.

---
Or, they doesn't know what layering in classic will be like because it's not out yet.
---
thank god we have layering for that then
---
I've been doing this too. I'm slowly making healthier choices. Bringing more food to work instead of buying it, incorporating jumping jacks and situps to be hourly when I grind during my 6 days off work, changing out a lot of my beverages for just straight water. I wish there was a HealthyClassicWoWPlayer Discord or something lol.
---
Lol this got me rolling with laughter with the tendies. Didnt see it coming. I'm for layering since itll make my leveling experience better and there will still be s healthy amount of people around.
---
No. I want to play and enjoy the game and I will. I will make it a great experience.
---
But by airing my grievances and providing feedback, I will also ensure that you and everyone else gets a better gaming experience too. I will make Blizzard aware of how the game feels to play.
---
You will just be toxic and continue to bait people.
---
And they have been doing this. It doesnt mean they should blindly follow all reddit advice.
---
I'm bringing Thexy back.
---
Here is how I experienced the same bug.  Running into org as a solo player was the second time I took noticed, or experienced layering in four days of playing wow.  Twice in about 36 hours of played time.  
---
I was trying to hand out Healthstones to people running out of Org.  I would have trade window open, but the player would disappear or phase out around the gates like shown in the gfycat.  So, I noticed I changed servers, but I could see the other person change back in later down the road.  All it did, was keep me out of hanging around the gates of orgrimmar, there was weird layering or server changing going on there.  I was ungrouped solo just handing out healthstones.  
---
The second time my friend invited me to a group.  I was on Eastern Kingdoms and he was on Kalimdor.  When he logged out, a few minutes later I changed layers and had a whole new spawn of enemies on me.  My last enemy was no longer attacking me, and a fresh spawn with full HP jumped on me when I was a little too worn down.  I was able to potion and finish him before continuing on my grinding route.
---
They are present in the finnish Classic Wow Discord: [https://discord.gg/87NmNb](https://discord.gg/87NmNb)
---
Yeah this layering thing was not around in 2004. There is no way to manually select a layer. You can group up with your friends on the same faction and that will bring y’all into the same layer, this is on a hidden cooldown to prevent people from taking advantage of this feature. We hope they aren’t done working on Layering. The biggest issue we have now is that major cities are completely barren due to layering which is about the worst thing possible for a community-based RPG.
---
It's like they specifically targeted that too, because the went through the complaints then did the exact opposite of what was wanted.
---
&gt;.&gt; why? &lt;.&lt;
---
Never played one in vanilla but I’m got like 6 priests in retail.
---
I think it would have the opposite effect as many people prefer to be the underdogs on PVP servers.
---
Someone farming the elementals in Arathi you want to farm? If it's opposite faction, you can kill them and take the farm. If its your same faction, you can try and share it or you can go pound sand.
---
Same thing on world bosses. If your guild is one of many in your faction capable of killing the world bosses, all you can do is try to get there and pull first and not wipe. If you're the underdog faction on the server there's a better chance that your competition for world bosses are guilds of the enemy faction and you can wipe them and have a shot at the boss.
---
Basically, a lot of people prefer to be able to kill other players who are taking world resources that they want.
---
Also BG queue times.
---
i'm a little biased, but from what I read here, it sounds like warlock is the best bet. soulshard farming isn't that bad, and from how you describe the pros and cons of each class, it sounds like you might have the most fun with a lock. you'll get used to managing shards, even if it's a bit of a pain in vanilla (no massive shard bag). you can get shards off any mob that grants exp, and the only reason you'd need to farm them is for getting the group healthstones/soulstones (not necessary either). i don't remember it being a big issue, honestly. and I don't remember much about debuff limits.
---
i started on vanilla but tbc came out before I reached 60, so most of my memory is of tbc and wrath. i started with a war, then went lock as my main. they're quite fun. i ran afflic and it was enjoyable. good for solo and pvp, and good dpser. they're a little trickier to run with, but if you learn the ropes, they're a great class.
---
Not really. They could keep layering forever or release new servers. And queues make less people play too, it naturally weeds out people.
---
most upvoted posts in this thread are from people who couldn't get into this layer to have fun... that's what layering does to the game...
---
I haven't seen much of that tbh, especially considering the backlash, although I'm sure there are many who have said that.
---
You cannot change anything after character creation, save for your equipped gear and whether you've chosen to show/hide cloak or helm. The barbershop wasn't added until Wrath, if I recall correctly (maybe Cata?).
---
You can still log on and reserve your name, then recreate the character when the servers go live if you need to.
---
Ich sehe Bier und Würstchen, ich wähle hoch!
---
I gotta ask though, why didn't you guys just agree on a side? By rolling opposite factions, you're going to miss out playing the majority of the endgame with your friends. I mean, the race to 60 and hunting each other while on chat sounds fun but what do you do at 60?
---
We had a 6/8 split and the Alliance guys relented and picked Horde so we could all play together.
---
Why did you make me look at his glowing, pulsating bulge? I did not ask for this curse.
---
Guilds work, but friends definitely not since most will end up only a few degrees of separation away from *everyone*.
---
Yeah. It happened organically. Which is cool. But streamers also put big events together and they are able to do that because they have a lot of fans.
---
To somebody who doesn't care about streamers, non streamer fights and the streamer fights will both feel as organic.
---
Racials are a lot less impactful than you think
---
Yeah that's pretty much where I'm at with the entire situation too. Blizzard has burned any and all of their goodwill with a lot of people, and by the time the end of phase 1 comes they're probably banking on people being too invested to quit
---
Ahhh thanks, thought I was stuck in some weird Korean realm timewarp fuckery
---
If we use the stress test as an example, then it’s immediate. I managed to get Thex - but as an orc warrior (the default choice). So a day later midday I logged back in, deleted him and made him a troll shaman. Worked fine for me.
---
What are you talking about? Each layer will have the same population as the old servers did. So the competition will be the same as it was on vanilla. What I am talking about is all the things that got in the way of playing the game, things like login queues etc.
---
Here, you were supposed to use the greater than sign, &gt;
---
Coz your english is excellent + you are actually good at the game? Played on a lot of servers over the past decade and never had a problem with swedes/danish ppl. Meanwhile Portuguese/Spanish ppl... you are lucky if they say more than ola to you. They are probably even below russians tbh.
---
14 say? Holy shit, I tried not to go on this sub because I couldn't take the wait. I didn't play the beta( not invited lol) and now there's 14 days left? Holy shit, see you all ingame!
---
Ahhhhh ok thanks
---
Your burnout is your problem
---
LOL no, its perm
---
 /salute
---
 /thank
---
Neither the poles or the spaniards are really super big vocal and interfering communities tbh. Think its overblown here.
---
Play how you want to play the game. Don’t tell others how to play the game.
---
We are playing a test. I'm assuming theyre trying different things to see how the hardware and software reacts.
---
Things like this should really be fixed with just 2 weeks left to release, but considering what I've heard about last second cludge fixes on the original WoW release, I'm not exactly surprised.
---
Thex is gone now brah you fucked up.
---
We employ several mechanics, and all of them are able to communicate in English. They might sneak in the odd German word but overall they will be able to convey the message they're trying to get across.  
---
And there is another thing people very rarely take into account:  
---
English is a language that has a very low skill floor, but a rather high skill ceiling. It takes a certain amount of time to speak English *well*, but it doesn't take a lot of effort to speak it at all. Which is why I personally don't know anyone that *doesn't* speak English to a degree where a conversation is possible. Even the people at the kebap shop down the street know enough English to sell their goods to the odd tourist from abroad.  
---
So if you claim that the majority of Germans don't know enough English to have a conversation I call bullshit.
---
Yeah I also don't understand this logic.
---
That was back in the beta. For the stress test it's how it will be on launch.
---
You don't know Activision huh?
---
/cries
---
Do you ever think twice before posting nonsense?
---
I will always consider multiboxing to be cheating. I am 42. I coded for several text MUDs in the 90s and we created tools to help catch multiplaying. Comparing text input of two or more characters to see if it was duplicated inputs.
---
One person controls one character at one time. If one person is controlling multiple characters by artificially duplicating unique input to spread to multiple chars I consider that cheating.
---
I didn't get to participate in this, but I was in Deathnell when the server opened and there were easily 100+ people in sight at any given time, maybe more, and other than a slight stutter sometimes when you turned quickly, there was not any noticeable lag. I even had the view distance put out at max and most other settings high. I was on a laptop with an older Nvidia chip and 2 GB of video memory too.
---
The cycle continues 
---
ITS JUST A BEEEETA
---
ITS JUST A STRESS TEEEEST
---
IT'S JUST LAAAAAUNCH
---
WE DIDNT WANT YOU ANYWAAAAYY
---
\^ we are nearly here
---
IM SO ALOOOOONE
---
Imagine not being able to keep up competitively so you have to play with 4 characters simultaneously.
---
80% of 4 millions is still way too many for the amount of servers...
---
Same here. Started playing in TBC so I love that expansion but I was still a noob so wotlk is where I really came into my own
---
&gt;\-Blizzard smartly released a conservative number of servers with more  ready to go if need be. This is because it is way easier to add servers  than to take them away and transfer people off dead realms.
---
I've seen this point parroted a few times, but never found a source. Do you have one?
---
You haven't been around twitch fanboys have you?
---
are you that stupid? lol
---
The point was that the Germans who will play on English Realms specifically want to speak English, so they won't be an issue.
---
Also I do think the vast majority of German players will be on the German realms and two might actually not be enough.
---
&lt;Catharsis&gt; NA-West-Fairbanks-PVP-Casual/Moderate Alliance Guild
---
Hey Alliance friends who have chosen Fairbanks! Well met! Our guild aims to be a community that caters to those who want to play with old friends, make new friends, find a home with likeminded excited people, and travel on this journey together. The guild will have veterans who have played for fifteen years as well as the fortuitously naive who will be experiencing its frustrations and exhilarations for the first time. There are no set nights for dungeons/pvp/events in that we hope to get enough guildies online, that we can group up and have fun on most nights of the week. As we get to endgame, we can then decide what our exciting next steps should be! Our current members come from all walks of life, and most are working professionals (authors, athletes, teachers, scientists, doctors, business managers) who all want to spend our evenings escaping to another vibrant world with each other. If this community sounds inviting to you, message me here on on Discord \~Swell\~#9845, and I'll send you our guild discord information!
---
People on reddit just love to whine and be outraged.
---
Instead you have to deal with group members that can barely speak your language
---
fun times!
---
&gt; Your food for thought sucks 
---
What a concise and well considered argument. I've been utterly refuted. 
---
If you actually took a second to think instead of looking at everything through a vindictive tantrum against streamers, you would see in a lot of cases it's more than a name being taken. It's a brand and some of these guys very livelihood. 
---
So yes. I'm going to defend the streamer who I don't know to protect their brand, over some screaming man childs need to not see streamers get preferential treatment. 
---
The streamhate IS pathetic. It's a spiteful and petty attack made out of jealousy that's thinly veiled as a debate that all players should be equal, as if streamers getting in a day early to reserve a name is some massive inequality.
---
And to be fair they're almost definitely correct to make that assumption.
---
Another OP commits the fallacy of thinking that Blizzard has an incentive to provide users with the best experience as opposed to making the most money for their shareholders. 
---
Yes, Blizzard has more information than we do. No, that doesn't mean they will use that information in a way most beneficial to their userbase. 
---
Look at how retail WoW if you want proof.
---
Tbh a lot of Warcraft players probably would pass the muster for Berghain entry. Skinny, pale people with an aversion to sunlight on stimulants are your standard Monday morning crowd.
---
Yeah I agree I'm not sure why they didn't just do it for the starter zones
---
Though I don't know the exact inner workings of servers/layering and all this stuff other people do
---
Maybe there would still be a problem on server load if you only had it for zones but open everywhere else
---
It does seem a little sketch that it on the surface seems to depend on a drop off of players
---
However I will say that it's much easier for the community to make more servers than dead ones. Although neither is ever smooth
---
This subreddit is made for feedback, and have you been to a blizzard launch, not really a pleasant experience.
---
Is it really that bad? They know a lot of people are going to quit within a few months. This happened with every private server release. Even the people who grew up on vanilla - you don't realize how rough it is until you're entering lategame. A lot of people just stop playing. Layering is easier than opening up a dozen more realms with the intention of closing them a few months after release.
---
How'd the 5 stack go?
---
This is like playing EVE again
---
yea no shit bro because my dopamine center is completely fucked up cuz I am in constant pain and restraint from an autoimmune disorder I have... and drugs take the edge off. Its either weed or painkiller meds and I don't wanna go back on those no thank you. Its safe to say without them I couldn't enjoy much at all so this at least helps me feel relaxed and allows me to do things I normally couldn't.
---
I'm not pro layering but its here so bitching wont solve it. Its good to keep discussing it but there are obvious benefits to having it included. Whether or not those benefits are worth it or not is a debate we can have.
---
A lot of pro layering posts are less about being pro layering and more about being positive and hopeful instead of negative. We want to have fun. Layering is here so we look on the bright side of it as best as we can.
---
Why do streamers get special privileged. If somebody wants to target me on a pvp server, guess what, maybe they think I'm a threat. Fine, I'll either go somewhere else or I'll get a group and fight back.
---
Streamers are essentially generals broadcasting their location. If they are getting targeted, guess what? They can do a number of things: 1) play the game and get viewers to help fight back or 2) not broadcast their location.
---
Let's pretend we're in regular vanilla and find an analog. I'm a guild master. I post on the server forum "I'm going to be at this location at this time". Guess what? If other guilds want to go ahead and try to kill me, it's not griefing. If I didn't want them to kill me, I wouldn't have broadcasted my location or I'd get my guild to fight back.
---
Why should streamers get special armor? Why should they have their experience protected? Nobody else has that privileged. *They* are the ones streaming their location.. they are the creaters of their own disadvantage. Why should Blizzard have to devote a team of paid managers to do nothing but ensure streamers have a good time?
---
Less vigorous means of fapping.
---
Well as an experienced player, I prefer to use Questie- but no atlas mapss. I enjoy the effort of going off instincts in long dungeons like Sunken Temple. I also enjoy being able to slowly uncover the map.
---
What are the consequences for a regular non elite hardcore player, playing on the streamer server?
---
It should be movable now in 1.0.7+
---
Are you aware that you are moving the goalposts? Because the whole point was you could switch layers to search for rare-spawns, full stop. It doesn't matter if retail has fewer or more layers, if it has at least two layers, you can switch layers and you can use that to search for rare spawns, period.
---
i'm making 3 on the pvp server Herod (horde)
---
i'm also making 3 on the pve server mankrik (horde)
---
i believe these will be the best EST servers for north americans. I'm doing both because I can't decide between PVE and PVP. I'm leaning more towards PVP but due to not being able to play 15 hours a day and I will have to go afk at random points due to having a wife and kids and a house and such, and also the fact that i'm not playing a druid, rogue, or night elf, I don't want to come back to my computer dead or get repeatedly spawn camped since I don't have a ton of time to play anymore and I'd like the time I do have to play not be frustrated by gankers
---
&gt;Kirito
---
I hope a player with this name will get killed a lot by some fury/arms warrior in black armor and with a huge 2h sword.
---
For raids, it depends on the class and spec. Some micro intensive techniques, like slam spec warrior or feral druid's swiftform-auto attack waving will suffer. Casters who spams frostbolts/shadowbolts, hunters and other one/two button classes will not have any major issues.   
---
 For PvP you are always handicapped.
---
&gt; You can fully get by in this game just reading the quest text and using your brain.
---
Like in real life: I can't care about what every single person I come across is saying. I can't care about every place I visit.
---
I'd rather have the option to read when I want, and not read when I don't want.
---
I don't care to read why a Blood Elf in the Blasted Lands needs x10 Basilisk Brain and x2 Vulture Gizzard.
---
I'd rather skip that to reach the places and lore I care about.
---
My servers were also European. All of them had a mix of Scandinavian, Italian, Greek, Spanish mostly, and lots of other non english country representatives on a smaller percentage.
---
Shadow is amazing in pvp if you are into that.
---
Haha no worries ;)
---
Personally, a big issue in this whole debate is the continued use of the term "steamers". There are hundreds of wow steamers whose followings have an insignificant impact on this issue.     
---
Really, the majority of the issue is Asmongold's following.
---
Well, fishing is all about waiting, so you're off to a bad start
---
No, they removed it for some idiotic reason.
---
Lots of danes seems to confirm Shazzrah from my research, from some surveys it seems the majority (98%) will be speaking English in public chats
---
You are assuming classic players are the same as the ones who are willing to pay for micro transactions. Classic players are players who were paying $0 for the game in the past. $15/mo from classic players who refuse to pay for retail is greater than the $0 in revenue that blizz would get if they did not release classic.
---
Hate to break it to you but you can't just scroll through 10 layers and you have no idea which layer you are on. This would be pointless.
---
Because I own Asuna body pillow and tattoo’d kirito face on my chest. In scale.
---
When I lay in bed, I put a balaclava over my head. Expose my chest, so kirito head is clear, then place Asuna head on my (Kirito) head.
---
It feels real to me
---
Enhancement/ele are generally only really viable pre-raid or once they are geared up. Enhancement is kind of boring in raids because of what they expect from you. 
---
If you're not playing resto in PvE your primary focus is probably going to be totem twisting and watching your mana, you still do it with resto but a lot less.
---
" Its been fucking 15 years, people dont actually REALLY remember how it was. They remember the FEELING they had."
---
I didnt remember that having my buddies disappear out of nowhere was vanilla
---
My first 60 was an Ele shaman, and I honestly loved it. Before that I'd tried mage and rogue and couldn't get past STV. I put enough points into enh to get my ghost wolf.
---
Loved it!!
---
Huh, so Shazzrah was one of the few bosses to be actually buffed after being introduced rather than nerfed.
---
**&lt;The House&gt; - Horde | PvP | Whitemane (non-streamer server, subject to change)| Raid Progression and World PVP**
---
**&lt;About Us&gt;** &lt;The House&gt; is a guild of friends and colleagues, mostly in PDT and CDT time zones, that are excited to come back and experience Vanilla WoW over again. Our members have a wide range of experience with WoW, from little to no experience with the game, to being part of hardcore raiding guilds, along with experiencing many expansions throughout the lifetime of WoW. Many of us played Vanilla WoW back in the glory days.
---
**&lt;What we provide&gt;** We want to build an inviting environment where the guild can grow together and foster the mindset of constantly improving yourself and your character. We are accepting of all experience levels of Vanilla WoW, it’s a game, we’re all here to have fun.
---
**&lt;What are we looking for&gt;** We are actively looking for members that want to progress through end game raiding content, but not at a hardcore pace. Our members have lives outside of the game, so we want to build an atmosphere of a consistent progression-based mindset, but without the 14hr a day dedication it takes to clear world/server first content. This would mean making an effort to obtain appropriate enchantments, bring consumables for fights we may need them on, taking advice from more experienced players to improve your rotations, and overall have a positive attitude.
---
While we don't expect everyone to no-life to level 60, we do plan on holding ourselves to a respectable standard when raiding.
---
**&lt;Raiding&gt;** Loot system: Primary focus utilizing DKP EP/GP, but with loot council when appropriate. 
---
Our raid times are tentative, but this is our current plan: 
---
Running 20-man raids on Tuesdays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
Running 40-man raids on Sundays @ 10am PDT/12pm CDT and Mondays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
**&lt;World PvP&gt;** Many of us are interested in running some pre-made BG's when they are introduced, though that isn't the primary focus of our core members. We will look to setup nights for coordinated world PvP. We have time until BG's are ready, so let's terrorize some Alliance scum and have some fun!
---
**&lt;Recruiting&gt;** We’re actively recruiting all people who are passionate about what they play. Our current roster is available here: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11SwJzLCkaBUkC-kSb4CgqUHf3Kzp8bguZ230MyBYQ70/edit?usp=sharing
---
Tank Demand: Low
---
Healer Demand: High

DPS Demand: Medium

Why would it kill your hype?  They said layering will be for phase 1 only.  It's either that, or we endure eight hour queues at launch, and a bunch of dead servers in phase 2.
---
Might be that I haven't played with a lot of Spanish people before, but if thats true then I can see why they wouldn't be liked.
---
Played with a ton of Russians though, and I typically don't like playing with them since so few speak english at all. Some of them are nice ofc.
---
Vurtne.  
---
He was far ahead of the majority with how to properly outplay and use engineering to his advantage.  
---
He also did it with absolutely horrendous gear.
---
It could be a big drop off, but what happens in the event that the launch population ends up being relatively similar to what will be the concurrent population of Classic? Or if it turns out to be a resounding success and actually ends up with more players than it started with by the end of phase 1?
---
New servers are basically the only solution that I can think of, but in typical Blizzard fashion they'll probably charge full price if people want to move to them
---
Blizzard said "you think you do, but you don't", and "don't you all have phones?"
---
Do you have a source for this?
---
If true, that is a whole other issue. You find a healer for your instance group but you can't summon him to the instance because he is on layer-switch cooldown?
---
Any good guild will not give you gear for meme specs over classes that can make better use of them. Put on the dress and heal as a shaman, or stay mage
---
(subtle concern)
---
I agree blizzard knows more than us, but despite that their decision making has been filled with mistakes in the life of this game.  I mean, "don't you guys have phones?"  "You think you do, but you don't."  
---
-Phase 1 is a Long Ass Time for layering to be around.  Leveling is a really important phase even for hardcore players because it's where you meet people and get an idea for who is your peer group in the server. 
---
-Adding servers is easy for blizzard but hard otherwise.  Server splits suck majorly, and no one likes to see their friends list or guild cut in half overnight.  Yes, additional launch day servers could help, but so many people are going to be on some of the larger servers that being taken away at phase 2 will almost necessitate a server split.
---
-No one gives a shit about how much their servers can handle in terms of technical strength.  They care about the impact the layers have on the social aspect of the game.
---
They need to allow us to pick which layer we want to be in like in SWTOR. odd EA did something right but Blizzard didnt.  
---
You can put it on a cooldown to avoid exploiting
---
I agree, but with the important addition that you have groups of servers that share the same name pool, so they can be merged easily.
---
Actually he's asking for a 2006 video game at the current height of human wealth and abundance.
---
Stop being a whipped bitch.
---
Of those listed the only confirmed non-streamer server is thalnos
---
It wasn't an argument it was a joke
---
You just broke a myth ...
---
Isn't the big selling point of Vanilla the community? With 10k+ people, how do you run into the same people or get to know the people in your server?  
---
Community was memorable from Vanilla because the server caps were extremely low, around the 3k mark, and you saw the same people often.
---
So they’re going to beta test the actual feature come release. Nice!
---
Honestly. Blizz’s *only* statement was that they’d essentially release the next phase when the community was ready for it.
---
Based on their phrasing it sounded like they didn’t have a timeline set in stone. 
---
That could be a lie of course and they could have a specific schedule. But it seemed to sound like they were going to release P2 when it made sense to. 
---
So. Probably after we’ve seen a lot of people hit 60, and a lot of casuals drop off. 
---
They haven’t ever stated a specific schedule though, with release dates, for the phases. So literally anything else besides “who knows” is speculation and conjecture.
---
True but I need to pick so I can maybe sleep the next 2 weeks...
---
With that much time you can probably make it work. There are farms below 110, just knowing which ones work on your server can be a bit of work. I would read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/woweconomy/comments/cjgaae/1month_wow_token_challenge_results_12_million/), which while still ends up being in BFA content sets up a good framework for testing out what sells and what doesn't on your server.
---
true, and I'm almost positive streamers are going PvE because they would never be able to get anything done if they went PvP
---
These periods of intense circlejerk are perfect for farming some Internet points
---
I actually doubt i will be playing after phase 1..
---
Not sure of the difference. Does atlas just show all the maps already completed?
---
Brudi
---
The general consensus is that Wrath was by far the best version of wow. Only complete losers like you missed it lmao.
---
People dont want to miss vanilla pvp :)
---
Some of my best memories are from world pvp so i wouldn't want to miss out on that. Yes ganking can suck, especially if you don't have a lot of time to play but at launch there will be plenty of people to group up with and i'm not in a rush to max level anyway.
---
Possibly, but adding servers at this stage is still a better mechanism than having lots of servers at launch that become dead.
---
I'd imagine that yes, there may well be high queues and free transfers offered to guilds etc from larger servers when it comes up to near phase 2.
---
IT WAS GOOD TO BE BACK HOME
---
I'm definitely starting on a PvE server. I never played vanilla and like you I just wanna take my time and enjoy the experience.
---
The astroturfing is unreal around here.  Every thread with proof that layering is fucked all the top comments without fail are "it's a bug" or "but that's not how it's supposed to work" but like it's coming out in 2 weeks there's no way they fix it
---
I’ve heard people talking about “/join world” or something and it’s a channel that isn’t layered, can anyone shed light on it?
---
Right, I get this concern.
---
My answer was related to "a list of Classic addons" - and the Curse filter (on the website atleast - not sure if the app has the filter) does just that, shows a list of addons working in Classic (as stated by their own developers).
---
My understanding is this: the addons support both live and Classic at the same time - same addon install works with both. I can confirm I've seen this in the past weeks several times in the 'release notes' while updating my 8.2 addons. However, just manually browsing that Curse filter I found one addon, that, under the "Files" tab (as if you were to manually download previous addon versions) had the 2 newest editions caled Classic \[version number\], while previously it was the addon's name. While I can't test this, by the looks of it, this addon looks as if it would have a separate Classic version.
---
This is the issue that scares me, I played towards the end of Vanilla, but mainly TBC. I don't know how things were at the start of vanilla.
---
Is this legit?  Can you please post the source?  This will be a big help thanks.
---
People are saying this won't be an issue because the stress test wasn't representative of how Layering will work on release.  However, while I think it won't be as bad, it will still be quite awful.  Layering reduces variance.  So it *will* prevent massive surges of players in one layer, which *will* reduce, or in some case ruin, times that otherwise would have been epic in nature with hundreds of players.  Also, you can very well have times where the top layer has only a few people in it and you're there.
---

---
Beta != Stress Test. And during none of those phases and tests has it ever approached non-aggressive levels of layering.
---
But hey, who am I to bereave you of your optimism. If you think they have a silver bullet laying around somewhere and just save it for launch: dream on!
---
Thank you .. people are being really stupid in these threads

Wait we can wall-run/jump again? This changes everything!

You talk like a spoiled kid dude, grow up, first time playing wow?,gurubashi and warsong dont have any problems with brazillians for years , just stop the mimimi
---
Let me know when that happens to you.
---
You think they do but they dont
---
The game needs phasing at the start to allow us to play the game. They are testing it and looking for bugs while planning on removing it in he future. All the crying is getting annoying.
---
6 mages shooting fireballs at raggy...
---
the way he phrases is could really mean both, either kalimdor + eastern kingdom as on layer or both as two seperate layers...
---
we need a bluepost with all the specifics, not an interview.
---
You're an idiot. 
---
As someone who has worked for a company that Activision bullied into selling out [visceral online campaigns that damaged us beyond recovery despite their legitimacy, and our lack of money to stand up to the corporate machine that is Activision] they absolutely will do this. They don't care about long term, it's all quarterly. Nothing else matters. The assets for classic were already there, and there was no real development needed. How much do you think they spent on tweaking a little bit of spaghetti code then saying it's good enough?
---
They have purposefully made games fail in the past to drive competition one direction. They have made their subsidiaries fail in the past to boost their own in company games. I shouldn't have to say anything beyond "Red Octane" if you know anything about how Activision works and what they do to small companies.
---
To add to this. If everyone has the trinket, then nobody does. And for the people you actually don't have it then it kind of becomes a requirement because all of a sudden everyone has this advantage over you vs the occasional encounter. I imagine it will happen with a lot of different items.

Layering will probably work as intended 99% of the time. The videos that we see are from the 1% of the time where there were issues.

I remember when LFG went global, it wasn't a very good day
---
Start your own guild and make PVE great again.
---
That's actually a really good point
---
i tried playing the stress test with my SO this weekend, but we couldn't see each other at all? How do i fix that when the game actually releases?
---
They have never done that. In vanilla dead realms were "Fixed" by having free transfers to them from overpopulated ones. It's a hard sell to get people to transfer to dead realms, but if the other option is sitting in a 2 hour queue every night many people sucked it up and went.
---
Draenor was a disaster, and tbh i can't imagine wow being very popular after that one. They are even afraid to show the playercount.
---
Good to know, world (besides lfg) was always the go to channel for chatting out in the great expanses of Azeroth. Seems strange they wouldnt have that as an official channel.
---
I seriously don't think it's going to be as bad at launch as everyone freaking out is making it out to be. I understand the whole #nochanges crew and being ironic and jokey about it, but I genuinely don't think it's all doom and gloom.
---
Pservers need to be taken with a grain of salt. I've tried a few, but there's either pay2play mechanics involved, or it's not really that close to a true experience. Even the best blizzlike servers were "off"

---
I was joking but seriously, I'm going with a different class/role/faction for a little change.
---
Oh, my sweet summer child
---
&gt; you watch 3-4 deep wounds stay on the boss
---
deep wounds is a low priority debuff and will be removed by stronger debuffs.
---
managing debuffs is not that complicated...
---
I see it being much like OSRS with a massive drop at the start (~60%) and then steady growth over the next few years assuming that they decide to create Classic WoW content once they've exhausted all of the vanilla content
---
(Source: http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/?display=avg&amp;interval=qtr_yr&amp;total=1)
---
That being said, with only 10(?) EU servers, and if they doubled the vanilla concurrent player cap being 5k due to modern hardware, there would need to be less than on average 50k concurrent EU players online by the end of Phase 1 to justify them removing layering so that they can fit everyone into the existing servers. And that's just to keep the servers below max capacity
---
I honestly think they will go Faerlina because Herod will increase their risk of not getting their names
---
I bet there's a shitton of people that will subscribe today just to reserve a name, but there's probably also even more people that are waiting for launch day to re-sub.  
---
I will not be surprised to see anywhere from 300,000 - 1,000,000 re-subs from Classic in the first like 3 months, I bet there's a shitton of re-subs from the stress test, I know I re-subbed because of it.
---
Just FYI Ragnaros is a Latin American server, not Brazilian.
---
Thalnos is the Brazillian realm so I'd avoid it tbh
---
How do you know Blizzard has detailed stats and planning?
---
of Warcraft.
---
Consider this:
---
There are going to be a massive chunk of players that will try out retail.
---
They will get fed up with some of classic's problems/lack of new content that they'll hop onto retail for a bit and realize that it's more what they want. 
---
More difficulty levels, faster level cap, more involved rotations, more viable specs, rated pvp, new content, xmog, encounters with more interesting mechanics, casual-friendly mechanics etc.
---
Warlock: Soul Shards are not an issue. The only problem is that you need a bag for them, which takes up a few more theoretical inventory slots (if you had 4 standard bags) than several of the other classes' reagents. 
---
The debuff limit is only relevant for raids, generally. Usually 2-4 debuffs per person is what they bring, so in 5-man stuff or PvP it doesn't get up there too consistently.
---
RIP
---
Fantastic.  Thank you.
---
Not only are the memes spicy and the community tight, but I think it has the highest chance of not being a streamer server. 👌
---
Keep in mind that you can definitely avoid the major streamers at the moment once it gets out which server they roll on but nothing is stopping them from server transfers later or new streamers popping up on your server of choice. It's the world we live in.
---
If the whole population sticks were just going to have very populated servers for a very long time.
---
That's IF "layering" is working correctly. But as we've seen, it's basically sharding; the "whole world layers where you never switch layers unless you change group or log" clearly just doesn't exist, and was a lie blizz pushed to get people to shut up about sharding. It's a new name, and nothing else. It clearly does not work as they advertised.
---
You could do sharding on only starter zones without an issue.
---
Kind odd a bummer post my man. Life is what you make it. Games too. 
---
Only time I feel down is when I'm taking games to seriously. Play classic chill and have fun. 
---
I can't wait to level fishing in my favorite spot. Brew some potions. And casual level while my 2 year old daughter busts in the office to tell me dinner is ready or it's time to play blocks. And then it's time for world of blockcraft.
---
Classic wow is here after 15 years! I'm going to suck every ounce of positively from day 1!
---
The only monetization for classic is subs. Subs require people keep playing. Best experience generally = more playing.
---
big if
---
Well, we still have things to worry about. We just dont really have any options to avoid them like NA does.
---
PvE player here so, no, I don't think so.
---
Aww that makes me sad
---
You're mistaking hate with envy or jealousy. They work just like the rest of us and some have them have worked to the point where they are making a decent living. Asmon takes care of his mother because she can't work. I congratulate him in his success because he uses it to take care of his mother probably a lot more then the rest of my entitled, coddled, narcissistic generation.
---
Explain
---
WOD had like a day and a half of issues and  Legion and BFA were smooth AF from the get go.
---
Actually extremely upset about this. 
---
Could have swore when I asked in beta people said chats weren’t layered
---
Can always go to Berghain instead.
---
There's no way it's 6 months of phase 1.
---
The majority of Europe knows how to speak english. I don’t remember this ever being a huge problem during vanilla.
---
Where did you say ‘everyone wants to go to Shazzrah’? My plan was to go there but I just picked randomly between the two. I’d prefer the less overcrowded server.
---
Local chat channels, such as General and LocalDefense, are Layered. Meaning if you do "/1 there's alliance south of Crossroads" then it is true that there are alliance south of Crossroads. "Server" chat channels, such as Trade Chat, WorldDefense, LookingForGroup, and any custom made chat channels such as "world" are server-wide and ignore Layers.
---
Same rules apply to Sharding in Battle for Azeroth currently
---
Shazzrah for brits.  Played classic on a realm with a lot of scandanavians.  those guys are ok too, no worries 👍
---
It's technically not cheating, because Blizzard allows it, because of $$$.
---
On pservers where the monetary gain does not hold up and everybody and their mom multiboxed it was mostly forbidden, because it goes against the spirit of the game.
---
You basically gain an unfair advantage over others.
---
That math is really wrong. 
---
There are 11 US servers last time I checked. So 55k *concurrent* in the US would be a reasonable number on that setup. 
---
That still leaves oceanic and Europe, and of course Asia/PAC which iirc hasn’t had servers announced yet. 
---
So probably more like 100k+ concurrent, with just Us, Eur, and Oceanic. 
---
Which is like 10x the largest private server?
---
That feels like a solid estimate to me, long term.
---
Of course skill matters the most but the general consensus is that Orcs have the better racial for both pvp an pve. I think the bigger reason people go UD is because it seems more natural for Rogues to be that race.
---
Layering will prevent anyone from seeing anyone else, ever.
---
I wanted pfui,  so tried for elvui now, but its not complete. Got dbm, luna unitframes, dominos, atlas, classic castbars, neatplates, questie
---
Basically i modernized the ui
---
These replies about you not having a problem with layering are “you think you don’t, but you do”
---
agreed
---
I'm going PVP the extra excitement when you see an alliance rogue headed straight for you in STV and then go stealth can't be beat.
---
What you fail to see is that layering is their attempt at an organic solution for the same solution you’re quoting.
---
Ideally there would exist X layers per realm, instead of having X realms that later get merged into 1. Their implementation may have some flaws now, as it’s mentioned that they’re artificially increasing the number of layers to stress test their scalability. It might look completely different once we get to live.
---
For example this stress test may have placed greater emphasis on keeping players who are guildmates in the same layer versus a previous stress test. We have no idea what specific configurations they’re testing - all we know is that this is a stress test.
---
I don’t work at Blizzard, but I am a software developer and all I’m saying is to hold your criticism and negativity until you run into issues when the game is launched. At this point you’re complaining about something that may be a non-issue. Maybe the entire point of this particular stress test was to check to see how different scaling settings impact different types of players, eg those with more friends than guildmates, or how it impacts players in cities. Since not at many people are on the stress test it makes sense to make the number of players in each layer arbitrarily small to increase the number of layers to test scaling.
---
Got your vodka... got your gammon of bacon... got your mead, looks like you’re all set
---
Have fun on the 50K pop server then.
---
It seems to be the general consensus on most wow related English Reddit communities that they will go there. 
---
I read that Polish,Scandinavian and some communities will play there as well, so both will be very mixed as is usual for Europe.
---
There are still lots of guilds advertising they will play on Golemagg and vice versa. 
---
Lots of playera wont ever open Reddit or WoW forums and just pick one of the two at random or wherever their guild will decide if they have on prepared in advance. 
---
Fact is both will be majorly overcrowded.
---
2 servers are never gonna be enough and the launch experience will most likely be terrible, just like it was when WoW initially launched.
---
It was barely playable for a little amount of people and lots couldnt even loginand they had to buy major server and infrastructure updates.
---
It makes no sense to have CC rep/vendors/questgivers to be available prior to Phase 5
---
I’m pretty sure that poll is pinned, or least available, on this sub.
---
On the flip side. It's 2019 and they're relaunching an identical game from 15 years ago because a loyal base of their community said it's better than the "new and improved" retail.
---
You're right about a lot of things, but never forget who brought us to this point of death by a thousand cuts.
---
Blizzard is a company at the end of the day. But their fault is the obsession with numbers and the pursuit of optimization and efficiency, they follow them blindly and that's what created sharding. Sounds good on paper, systematically destroyed the worlds cohesiveness.
---
Now we have layering, "necessary evil", "dynamic population control" and we completely give up one cohesive world. "gone by phase 2", yet there's barely any servers, and new discoveries with video footage of zone instancing are creeping up. Phase 2 is showing signs of having a layering / sharding / phasing hybrid.
---
As far as we know it doesn't close. It's open until launch.
---
If you have played WoW since the beggining all the way to BFA you'd notice that blizz has an essential problem: they always think they're right. Even if the game is crashing and burning for everyone to see *they know better* than players. Look at BFA, how long it took for them to acknowledge that azerite is in fact shit, what if they take that long to acknowledge classic issues, where there are no patches to retain players who quit?
---
I'm the same but for night elves. Playing Tauren feral and not having vanish will really hurt
---
Hm, doesn’t the Force Reactive Disc look different? Like that it has geara on it or is that a old model?

LF1M DPS for 5-man dungeon grinding. Going 12+ hours a day for the first week only. If you only took a week off from your job and want to put a major dent in your level in the time you have off, this is the group for you! Our aim is to pass level 51 to get everyone into BRD range before people go back to work. People can level on their own once the work week returns, and still be able to group up for BRD runs with level discrepancies.
---
If you're referencing the Reddit Classic Census, roughly 190 spaniards responded to it for the 2 PVP realms, hardly the voice of the community... The self appointed voice of the community "The Coalition" said they were announcing their realm choice at 11PM 11/08/19, and they chose Shazzrah.
---
You're absolutely right, I'm not refuting that claim at all. I had the same experience. I'm replying to the comment above that states a 10k+ population is "fine".
---
That's gunna be a huge bummer when he's in a layer by himself for all of phase 1
---
That’s pretty much what I was going to accuse you of. So obviously there’s been some kind of miscommunication.
---
I’ve said that we have yet to see layering working properly/as intended for release. 
---
You for some reason interpreted that as me wanting classic to fail. 
---
Then you said that all we’ve seen of layering has been a test, and not what we’ll see on release. 
---
So considering that we haven’t been able to see what it’ll be like in its final form, I said that they are treating the release as a beta test for layering.
---

---
You also have to take into account the amount of players that want to take place in this sort of thing is a small portion by % so without layering the total amount of players that would be here would be far less. There are also artificial barriers in the form of a PvP 15 cap funneling people into this instead of continuing to level up.
---
Thus sort of thing will be exceedingly rare in the actual game until the majority of players hit 60 and want to PvP, by then phase 2 will be out and layering will be gone.
---
For sure most people playing won't know about it, but if they're the sort of people who aren't interested in BiS PVP trinkets, d'you think they're going to care about layer hopping to farm rare stuff in general..? As you say, it's not going to affect the vast majority of people. Whilst there were definitely cases of layering gone bad in this last weekend most of the people playing didn't give a shit.
---
You might not want all that, but it's happening. Your only choice is play or not play. I personally don't want to end up on a server that dies within a year, so I'm all for temporary layering in the first few months of the game. If it doesn't work? Different story. But we'll cross that bridge if we need to at the time.
---
The populations were bogus datapoints. They're good for other pservers to use, but can't reflect real numbers for populations in a true vanilla server. Some won't play because vanilla isn't as giving, some wil play because it doesn't have the bogus shit from pservers. 
---
That's like basing projected sales of a CD from how many were pirated. People who would buy the cd wouldn't all pirate it, and not everyone who pirated it would buy it.
---
Is there a list of realm names anywhere? Would be nice to decide a realm ahead of time to take that out of the time equation.
---
How did I not defend it? I said hes not a bigot because he has a reason for not liking the pandering which isn't bigotry. A very common opinion. I showed you a good reason why that is true. You said "Lel you must be a bigot too".

Got any proof or sources to these contradictions you speak of?

@AutoModerator:
---
Why is "Guilds: North America - Alliance- PvP" the only category that does not have it's own section, here, for Players Seeking Guilds?
---
And then there'll  be people here defending the ghost towns at launch with "Blizz knows better".  I guarantee it.
---
Same time. Going to edit that into the OP...
---
The cheapest solution that maintains the most profit potential is the one they will go with, whatever that happens to be. 
---
If that means keeping layering in to save on servers (which don't really cost anything comparatively for a company this large... it's probably more about oversight of those servers than actually deploying them), then that's what they'll do. That's what every 'for profit' company does and Blizzard is no different... especially now.
---
Fake news.. Layering wouldn't allow this many people to exist in Org at the same time.

If Blizzard didn’t do layering, people would still be mad. It is lose-lose for Blizzard. People are assholes.
---
It's definitely more fun to make up shit about why someone thinks something than try to understand the issue.
---
The scandinavian project guys are atleast 4000+ players according to their discord.
---
Mana users generally have it easier.
---
I leveled a rogue and a druid during the stress test. Druid was *over twice as fast*, and did not struggle with any mobs. Meanwhile the rogue struggled with normal mobs, and some normal mobs like the spiders in Silverpine actually managed to kill me despite just having bought top level daggers.
---
I could use it to chat normally on the stresstest...didn't spam ofc, but replied frequently to others. So far no limit that would inhibit normal conversation.
---
&gt; You don't have the ability to control each mage individually on specific spells/movements without alt tabbing and actually controling that mage.
---
Why would you need to? Mages only cast 1 spell in raids and in the open world 10 perfectly synched frostbolts will 1 shot a mob anyway.
---
&gt; there's no way one person controlling 5 characters is going to defeat two people
---
Until they 1 shot you in the time it takes to cast 1 frostbolt because 5 hit you at the exact same time.
---
&gt; The mage would have to be inhumane even with a program assisting them to play
---
They do, this is how they control them all at once.
---
I’m thinking that warrior is Elf, rogue is Dwarf, and priest is human. 
---
You can even hear the Dwarf grumbling that the Human priest couldn’t cast Fear Ward during Magmadar.
---
Will these characters be deleted or will we be able to use them when classic is released? As in should I care about the hair style of the character
---
I will! Can't get vanilla wow mechanics from another game!
---
I was not sold on layering initially, but after seeing the same people over and over again out in the World I can say that I won't mind it as much.
---
But I still hope that they will remove it once P2 comes around.
---
It's like if your favorite band rereleased their best album. Imagine this album was originally some sort of limited edition, limited pressing, etc, and that they no longer perform, and this album predates piracy, so the only way to get this music again is the rerelease. You're so excited for your classic tunes, you wait for weeks, impatiently refreshing your browser until you can purchase your sweet, sweet tunage. Then, when you get the .flacs, you realize, as the blood drains from your face.
---
*They have been remastered.* ***Poorly.*** 
---

---
A lot of Cenarion Hold has nothing to do with the AQ raid.
---
Thanks for the battle. What a blast!
---
Names are server specific. If you make a 'Thex' on a server, I can't make a character called Thex on that server, but I could go to another server and make a Thex.
---
I don't count "barely speaking with minimum word count" as speaking English. Communication in wow is a bit more complicated than "hi, buy döner, five Euros please, thanks bye"
---
I’m actually hoping they expand it to 5 after they see the number of people reserving names. I know many people who also plan to play but don’t care about name reservations.
---
1 on Herod, 1 on thalnos, and saving one if a new server pops up
---
**NA/EU account are separate.** You need to create a new account to sub to EU.
---
I guess it's just a wait and see. I will still play classic but layering has left a sour taste in my mouth and I think it will be in for a relatively long time until people decide to transfer rather than blizzard forcing huge ques.

I know enough about you if you have to question a simple process of choosing names where VIPs to blizzard get first priority. Move along now.
---
As someone who never played Wow but still really excited for classic, I'm really worried about layering. Not so much as the reasons people have already said (which are somewhat valid), but because of that "community feel." From what I heard back in actual Classic, there was a sense of community. You could make a name for yourself, your actions had repercussions (good or bad). But with so few servers, and adding layers as 'faux-servers' I'm struggling to see how it would be possible. For me personally, I'd like a east-coast Pvp server with no streamers. So right away I'm limited to 2 or MAYBE 3 servers. I bet thousands of other people are in the exact same boat I'm in. 
---
And I think there will be 'popular layers' and less popular ones. The popular ones will have no sense of community and the less will die off. Merge them together and it ruins what little community they might have had left.
---
I'm not saying simply adding more servers is the fix, or that layering ruins this, but there's got to be a better way then giving people almost no choice for the server then just smacking 15 layers in it and calling it a day.
---
&gt;Meaning they will most likely crack down even harder on those type of Servers.  
---

This comparison is ridiculous

German Semi-Hardcore Progress on Lucifron
---
Hallo zusammen,
---
wir möchten an dieser Stelle unser Classic Projekt “Banana Squadron” vorstellen. Als Kern aus ambitionierten Spielern ist es auch in Vanilla unser Ziel, als Allianzgilde oben mitzuspielen. Viele von uns kennen sich schon seit Jahren; wir haben von ehemaligen Classic Maintanks und Raidleads über Multigladi Leute bis zu aktuellen Cutting Edges alles dabei.
---
Wir bieten eine entspannte, auf Erfolg ausgerichtete Atmosphäre, Hilfsbereitschaft sowie ein auch außerhalb von Raidzeiten lebhaftes Discord.
---
Wir werden die Verantwortung auf mehrere Schultern verteilen und ganz oldschool mit Classleads spielen und begrüßen natürlich Leute, die sich einbringen wollen. DKP sucht ihr bei uns vergeblich, wir spielen mit einem transparenten Loot Council. Unsere Raidzeiten sind mittwochs und montags von 19 bis 23 Uhr.
---
Von euch erwarten wir
---
eine stabile Internetleitung und entsprechende Hardware
---
Motivation, Zeit und Ehrgeiz
---
eine hohe Attendance, auch im Farmstatus
---
Kommunikations-, Team- und Kritikfähigkeit
---
ein ausgeprägtes Spielverständnis und entsprechende Vor- und Nachbereitung
---
Wenn ihr also nicht auf den Kopf gefallen seid, den Willen habt euch stetig zu verbessern und idealerweise Erfahrung im PvE Bereich vorweisen könnt, schaut auf unserer Homepage https://bananasquadron.guildtag.com vorbei oder meldet euch bei Kaito#2146 / Sebestyén#21515.
---
It could also be that Blizzard ran the numbers and figured out that the amount of people switching from retail to classic is much smaller than the hundreds of thousands, possibly million(s) returning to the game.
---
All in all I think that even though it's also a fan service, it wouldn't have been made reality, had they not seen it's financially lucrative.
---
They crunched the numbers and saw that there is a bucketload of money to be made.
---
Also retail and classic are so far removed from each other that you can't even speak of the same game. It's like comparing The Witcher 3/Gothic2 with Diablo 3/Path of Exile. They are all technically considered RPGs but nobody would lump these games together.

#  &lt;Encore&gt; |Horde| [NA-EST-PvP] Recruiting Raiders &amp; Social Players 
---
Encore's planned raid schedule will run on Wednesday and Thursday, from 8pm EST to 11:30pm EST. After the release of BWL in phase 3, a third raid night dedicated to previous tier farm content, and 20-man raids will run on Sunday, from 8pm EST to 11:30pm EST. We are not competing with any other guild on our realm for progression first kills. What we offer are well organized raids on a lighter schedule led by highly experienced, level-headed players. We have clearly defined goals for the raid team, and as a community we work to help our members reach those goals. Distribution of loot in raids is governed by the EP/GP system (Effort Points &amp; Gear Points). Encore's effort point system incentivizes attendance, and punctuality. A loot council assembled from class officers and raid leaders will establish class priority on a narrow range of exceptional BiS raid epics, and player priority for legendary weapons. Recruitment is open to all players. Whether you want to raid from Onyxia all the way to KT, or you're just seeking a friendly community of WoW veterans to level and pvp with, we welcome everyone.   
---
To apply contact the GM on Battlenet (Delphi#1393), or through Discord (Delphi#4818). Then take a moment to complete this form. [https://forms.gle/BqJYaz6fGDV1twNk9](https://forms.gle/BqJYaz6fGDV1twNk9)

Why do we even need layering in capital cities
---
Whose to say that a large corporation like Blizzard, with all of its games, doesn't have a ton of troublesome bureaucracy and decentralized/inefficient decision-making?
---
Some people in Blizz may know better, but given how uncommunicative they've been with the community, my bet is on those people being bound by red tape.
---
Nooooo^oooo^ooooo^oooooo^oooooo^ooooooo
---
That guy was the very reason why I made this post :-)
---
I think people are making more out of than they should really. I know it's not perfect but it will be okay. I'll still have some fun leveling. I hope you all do to.
---
Are you saying you wouldnt have retards follow and annoy you in game for a million bucks a year?
---
Funny enough, this bug actually still exists in Retail, it's just very rarely seen because Tagging doesn't happen in most cases anymore. But if you're in War Mode (which is an opt-in PvP server toggle basically) it CAN happen due to the faction tag.
---
You're right, they're being completely rational thinking a company developed something to make sure it failed.
---
Aren’t you a nice person
---
I can see that. More when you count casual people like me who will be popping on and off to play with friends. Either way, a sub is a sub.
---
You need to understand your role with both.
---
As enhancement, your role is as a support class first, dps second, as your dps will never be comparable to a rogue or a warrior. If you get a raid spot as enhancement, you'll be a totem twister for a melee group, likely be the raid's Nightfall applier, and also be expected to spot heal as needed. None of these jobs are particularly gear dependant, which means you'll be basically dead last in priority for gear. If gearing up quickly is a priority for you, or you want to top DPS meters, enhancement is not the spec for you. It's very much a support role.
---
Elemental is a little weird. You're more of a pure dps than enhancement; you won't be a totem twister as you won't have the mana or rotation space for it. The spec suffers from pretty extreme mana management problems, but with proper downranking and consumes, this can be overcome. The main issue with the spec is how high the vast majority of raid bosses' nature resistance is, and this massively impacts your potential dps. Moreso than any other class/spec in the game, you'll have the super frustrating experience of having your spells be either full or partially resisted regularly. This will hold true all the way until AQ40 is released, when spell penetration gear becomes available. This is when the spec really takes off and, in my opinion, is very underrated. Your dps can become very solidly mid-tier once you're outfitted in tons of AQ40 gear, but the problem is, by that point, you're going into Naxx, the last raid of the game. So you'll have to suffer through a lot of mediocrity for the vast majority of the game's content, only really getting noticeably better at basically the very end of the game, as compared to mage that dominates the meters from start to finish. Gearing will be easier than gearing enhancement, as you basically get all the caster mail by default, but a lot of your BiS will either be cloth, or shared with the resto shamans in your raid, both of which will be prioritized to your mages/locks/healers, respectively. 
---
I'd say elemental is definitely the more versatile of the two for dungeons/soloing. You can easily fill a healer role with the standard 30/0/21 elemental spec for 5-mans, which can make getting groups easier, and it's also quite capable of solo farming DM-East later on as a fast way of grinding gold.
---
I know you asked specifically about pve, but I figure I'll mention that both are good pvp specs, especially elemental. Enhancement has serious mobility problems and has a lot of RNG involved, but it can be wildly effective in certain scenarios. Elemental is one of the best pvp specs in the game; its burst is absolutely insane and you can destroy people in seconds. 
---
In closing, if you're really interested in learning more about enhancement or elemental, I very strongly recommend these two videos:
---
[Enhancement](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HjcpkrN2ADM)
---
[Elemental](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m7NWG9w8qWI)
---
Both should be able to answer any question you could feasibly have about either spec.
---
Horde scum!
---
alt-right name
---
Because layers are supposed to have as many players as a wow server on launch. So the leveling experience would basically be the same than the first launch in this perspective.
---
Now, I don't know if we will be 'saved' in one layer and tend to play within it as we log back in. That's my main concern about the layering system.
---
How do you know that though, I've never known it to work like that.
---
Well the name isn't boobear, but we were already in a group. Right on top of each other and still couldn't see each other. Is this the layering shit people are talking about?
---
If the population remains high, or increases, at the end of phase 1 then why can't layering be removed and more servers created with free transfers from high pop to low pop?
---
well the party was outside Stormwind bruh.
---
Why would they make Classic in the first place then? It makes no sense at all and is nothing more than a conspiracy theory.
---
It's not rumors.  It's a logical business conclusion.  I can guarantee with 100% accuracy that talks of management at Blizzard have hinged around how Classic is a dead end for revenue growth and how it being very successful could shine a bad light on their current efforts to drive revenue with Retail.
---
They are under a lot of pressure.  They lost 50% income since last year.  King is performing way better than Blizzard and they need to make the case that they can somehow be just as profitable and are worth all the money being invested into them.
---
Are they really because of streamers, or do people just want someone to blame?
---
Bullshit. Outside of this echo chamber I'm actually seeing a lot of negative talk about it from the last stress test. People are realizing the original game is slow and boring.
---
The original game is almost entirely WALKING. That's primarily what you do in it. Dumb kids aren't going to go for it.
---
How do you even ban people from channels? I tried a few commands but they didn't work.
---
The reason I want to ban people is that sometimes retarded people find their way into the guild-only channels on private servers and wreak havoc.
---
It literally did this morning on the EU stresstest. In fact, that was what prompted me to make this post.
---
Just look for it in the first update after launch. Should be there
---

---
I subbed just for classic and it has been glorious over the weekend.
---
I would be lying if I said wasn't concerned about layering but I didn't see any issues over the time I played.
---
The likelihood is that they were adjusting settings on the layering system throughout the stress test which is why some people saw issues.
---
I'm confident that blizzard will pull this off.
---
Must be nice. I played 4 different characters, getting them each to level 10, and ran into layering issues on each character.
---
They weren't game breaking issues, but trying to clear an area for a quest, just to get jumped to a different layer with those mobs alive and on top of you, is pretty frustrating.
---
At one point last night, there was a big mob of horde in westfall killing people. Layering made it really difficult for alliance to put up a solid defense. Obviously people were too low for it to matter during this test, but it takes away some of the fun of world pvp when I kill your NPCs and you just jump layers...
---
Okay thanks for confirming, I thought I wasn't seeing them all
---
Danish coalition is Golemagg for PvP and Pyrewood for PvE Alliance
---
Summer lasts until mid september.

That's only going to be the first few days, and even then you could get an addon that filters your chat quite easily.

A seperate layer with seperate economy? what?? Are you sure you know what's the purpose of layers?
---
What a shill
---
Shazzrah is probably onna be the safe bet. Scandis speak english and the brits roll there too.
---
PvP? PvP.
---
Sorry i did not mean to come off that way. I was not trying to put words in  your mouth, i was writing that to just clearify my opinion to other people that migh read this aswell. 
---
Ps. I would never want to play on a streamer server myself and i have no problem with people saying it might ruin peoples experience, but people seem to think that it's okey to harras streamers because of it and/or want special ruled to be applied to them.

---
&gt;In short, everyone is freaking out for no reason, wait for launch, if everything is fucked after launch then complain. Right now Blizzard knows more than you. 
---
Literally everyone in /r/wow before BfA (almost exactly 1 year ago today).
---
People are freaking out because Blizzard has a well-established history of this cycle:
---
* Don't worry, it will be fixed before alpha ends!
---
* We fully understand the complain, and it will be fixed before beta ends!
---
* Wait for launch!
---
* We will fix it in the first major content patch.
---
* We will fix it in the next major content patch.
---
* It will be fixed next expansion.
---
Why this sounds good on paper, I see 3 pitfalls:
---
* Getting people to join the group to fill it in the first place
---
* Getting in from the outside
---
* It's still player moderated
---
The 3rd point is the most impactful. No matter how respected a member is, people are people. They quarrel, they fall prey to emotions, they have a bad day, they can be inebriated. And all of a sudden, Mr. Respectful banned someone.
---
**Global means of communications are too important to be moderated by players.** That's my point.
---
Me too man. Even after years of WoW, pservers, and other MMOs, I get panicky when I'm attacked out of no where. In PvE, I know my rotation and can execute even when things go wrong but as soon as I hear that *whoosh click*, my brain takes a sabbatical.
---
But it's still a large portion of what makes the open world feel alive. That fear of running into Nessingwary's to turn in quests makes me feel like I'm in a legitimate dangerous place. 
---
I gave a PvE server a chance once to play with an IRL friend and I just couldn't get into the game. Similar to how when single player games have multiple difficulties, I'll always play on Normal or higher because even though the story is the same -- something feels wrong if it's too easy. 
---
But hey, that's just me. There's nothing wrong with PvE servers, but you just have to accept that the majority of players would rather play a PvP server. You're in the minority on this one, so you gotta make do. There will be plenty of people on the PvE servers either way. (:
---
You clearly don’t get it man. There is a gigantic ripple effect from having layering/sharding that will fundamentally change open world gameplay. It rips the soul out of the vanilla experience. I know it sounds like I’m being dramatic, but it’s true.
---
No one would want that until you spam it everywhere, now a bunch of people are going to reserve it just for the lulz -_-
---
If the MT is a druid it is less than a warrior.  This is the classy Friday Druid thread.
---
They maintained servers with a much higher population in classic before layering/phasing. There was lag sometimes, but lag also meant that a lot of people were gathering to do something which was a good thing.
---
Right off the bat your first argument is incorrect. Ion first said that layering will be only for the first few weeks and other devs said it will be gone by phase 2, your argument is incorrect.
---
The real question is why do you think this wasn't the first solution blizz thought of?
---
Well, believe it or not, it had actual roleplayers in vanilla! With lines in general and party chat and whatnot. And it had almost 50/50 A/H ratio, which is good for PvP (remember, there weren't always crossrealm battlegrounds, which means in vanilla you can only play BGs with people on your own server). 
---
And people there were really nice. I once joined some \~20 lvl  dungeon as tank with no clue how to do it and what abilities to use, and some hunter very patiently explained it all to me, and despite a ton of failures on my side we successfully finished the dungeon, and made a quick run in another lower level dung later. This experience basically sparkled my wow tanking career, ending being MT of a fantastic guild (fantastic as in overall atmosphere and players there; we haven't even finished Serpentshrine Cavern due to lack of numbers, but jeez, wish I haven't lost contacts of these people...), and as I understood much later, it was the best guild I've ever been.
---
The number of servers is irrelevant from a hardware perspective, but definitely not from a community perspective. Nobody is arguing that their hardware is going to be too stressed.
---
My comment was not about layering.
---
I didn't roll what I intend to main.  Could be the case for others as well.
---
Otherwise, this is some good insight.
---
They literally said they didn't think people actually wanted classic and "you just think you do".
---
They don't have all the answers.
---
Current retail wow is a joke. Subs have been declining since forever. Bad decisions are made constantly by Blizzard that drive away players.
---
Oh but the same company that makes all those bad decisions? Yea they know what they're doing.
---
Ok then.
---
You’re delusional if you think any of the big streamers won’t have their name by one way or the other
---
I haven't subbed so I can't tell for certain if they all work but most of them should be confirmed or in development. This is what I'm planning on getting:

And download the addons as close to launch as possible
---
the only difference being, layers make me cry harder than an onion
---
Correct, you'll stare at the grey realm-server list and it refreshes automatically to become green. It only refreshes once every 30 seconds though, so you MIGHT be 30 seconds late. I've been trying to find a way to refresh it manually, but the only way i've found is to close and re-open the realm selection, which would mean a queue to log back in :(
---
What’s so hard about keeping layering just in the starter zones? It shouldn’t have to be an all or nothing kind of deal
---
Went to multiple cities, they were dead
---
I resubbed for the stress test and name reservation, but I'm the only one who did of my group of 5 friends who will be returning to play.  They will resub for launch.
---
I think APES are messing with everyone saying they're going golemagg, they'll roll on the most popular server IMO which right now seems to be shazz.
---
Or use stimulants...
---
Which makes less sense why they won’t just come out and tell us what server they are rolling on
---
I suspect thats why the gave themselves a two week window - to gather intel on demand vs servers.
---
No. Wrong. Not having layering will ruin the game instantly for the average person and drive them away because the huge queues, followed by packed zones unable to complete quests and finally leading to dead servers before mergers can happen. 
---
Layering is a bandaid until queues are naturally lower, pop is naturally lower and finally layers can be seamlessly combined to prevent the feeling of dead severs. 
---
This means the people who want to stick around will stick and not be driven off by the above issues. Hardcore players like yourself will still play. If you dont play now I'm sure you will when its removed. It's just a necessary evil.
---
Fair enough obivously it's not supposed to match that of nostalrius, and obivously other people had a better experience than me with more players around at the end to make it seem less fair this screenshot. But i have no shame in saying i have an anti layering narrative as people will have the same experience as me that i just highlighted and overall harmful to the social dynamic of servers. Hard to create social bonds with players if you're so seperated.
---
Layering isn't a compromise, it's rebranded sharding. It's actually pretty insulting.
---
Even if it does get 10 million subs it won't make more money than Retail.  Classic will need 15+ million to beat Retail financially, and since all Activision cares about is increasing profits....
---
Of course they would, but they would also prefer people are playing their games in the first place. A diverse game lineup keeps more players on their platform
---
the videos we have seen of people entering Org as the duelers outside disappear behind them is also sharding not layering so im beginning to doubt there is a difference
---
!remindme 30
---
Saupreiß-Alarm.
---
China doesn't get their own servers? I thought they had a pretty big WoW population on their own. Or did they always play on OC servers?
---
Some people really think Classic WoW is gonna kill retail and end up with over 10+ mill subs. Every game has a huge drop off of playerbase usually after the first or second month mark, Classic WoW won't be any different.
---
After the nostalgia wears off for some, and people get sick of the grind &amp; slow pacing, they'll leave. That doesn't mean the game won't be successful, it just means that it'll have a drop in playerbase (as any "new" game does).
---
You cannot only layer specific zones. It has to be server-wide or not at all.
---
We will see, bigger crowd of people, hopefully lots of actual vanilla vets to lead the charge
---
&gt; So literally anything else besides “who knows” is speculation and conjecture.
---
Which is why this sub is so annoying half the time. Everyone thinks and talks like they know, but they're literally just guessing and most of the estimates (about anything here) are outlandish.
---
Layers are not servers. They couldn't participate in something happening ON THEIR SERVER.
---
Eh, let them sulk in their private servers. They were great when we had nothing, but they're so full of problems *infinitely* worse than just layering that they'll exist for the screeching masses and those who can't afford/don't want to pay the sub. 
---
They scream about #NoChanges, but they'd rather play on a private server that could just disappear at literally any moment. Plus, literally every big private server has so many corruption issues with their staff, if not straight up selling gear for donation points or whatever.
---
If layering is the biggest problem right now, we're doing great. Shit's gonna be gone once phase 2 hits, anyway.
---
It's not a financial reason. The game cannot be played with 50k people on a server. There is no incentive for a player to either a) reroll - throwing away hundreds of hours of playtime to have to do it again, or b) pay / take a free transfer from a hugely active high pop server to a brand new desolate server. Time has shown that people migrate to high pop servers - just look at the server pops on retail right now.
---
Maybe the #2A people can do something, I don’t know.
---
This is willfully misconstruing the argument.  Layering is fine for phase 1.  They don't have enough servers right now to ever take layering away.  We can see massive interest in this game.  This sub has grown 10k over the weekend.  No one wants layering in the long term and no one wants overcrowded classic experience.  They need at least 25% more servers for launch to give people more options, and they will still need to open more eventually.
---
Has that been confirmed or are you just speculating? I wouldn't be surprised if it were true, I'm just curious if you've heard anything.
---
Freal. Almost drowned a few times trying to get makura eyes in durotar last night
---
....the whelp caves look like ovaries.....
---
The problem with Classic WoW is not streamers, it is the current culture.
---
Wanna blacklist people and brag about it? Get ready to be stream sniped and griefed. Wanna gank someone you don't like? Get ready to get the same treatment in return.
---
I'd bet the current ToS is not the same from 2005.
---
no ur right i mixed up how they’re handling respawns in starting zones.
---
The stress test was layered was it not...
---
It's a beta, which is a testing environment.  They likely have constraints set to test targeted aspects of layering, which would allow things outside of those constraints to act abnormal.  
---
&gt;That's not how it should work" is no longer an excuse.  
---
It'll no longer be an excuse when/if it happens during live.
---
Big if true
---
Having separate servers with the intent of merging them later is the exact same thing as layering without the ability to interact with the players that will eventually be on your world.
---
ruh roh AND YIKERS!!!!!!
---
Resistance numbers, random add mob numbers, random add mob spells and alot more.
---
Again, they're memes. I'm not saying they can't blow people up.
---
I'm saying that's their one trick pony. If that doesn't work (and against good coordination it won't) they're free kills.
---
Where's the competitive raiders breaking kill times or the Ranked PvPers who dominate Arena and Bags as multiboxers?
---
And those people weren't going to subscribe for more than a month anyway, so it doesn't even how much they dislike it.
---
On minute 1 of the stress test Esfand's stream showed (1) characters on a server, but when he went to create a character nothing was on the list.  I suspect that was a database bug from how they did the streamer name reservations.
---
&gt; if Classic actually ends up gaining more players than it loses then it literally won't be possible for them to get rid of it unless they just add a load of new servers and give people free transfers
---
So you just proposed the easily solution which was already used in vanilla. This means layering will always be removed no matter what happens to the population. 
---
However, if they choose no layering, over estimate the realms required, the result is dead servers. The solution to dead servers is mergers which is vastly worse than overpopulation issue due to losing character names.
---
So it sounds like you have everything figured out and layer on minimal servers at launch is the best options and will be a non issue once layering is **definitely** removed before phase 2. And if not, the game will still die either way just a whole faster with layers after phase 2.
---
Yeah, totally agree!
---
http://pagle.classicdiscord.net works, this got buried so I neglected to update it to the new landing channel.  See you there!
---
This is literally just pure ignorance and envy. What plans to ruin the game are you talking about lmao? Streamers give the game so much exposure and lengthen its lifespan, sure their fans can be annoying but people here are VAAASSSTLLY overestimating how much they'll actually run into them. But there is nothing ''legendary'' about some greedy idiot deciding to appeal to the angry, envious crowd by targeting streamers and then getting views himself. That's just called being an opportunistic piece of shit.
---
Yes. I consider the game to already be dead because of the inability to participate in a 40 man-level 15 raid on Goldshire. Everyone knows that is the core of classic and is 90% of what you will be spending your time on.
---
Thank goodness. I mean, I miss the old interactions with GMs, but We'd be naive to think blizz will hire more people to moderate their community like they used to.
---
Weird, I was told that capital cities will be completely empty thanks to layering?
---
&gt; world cohesion for quality of life improvements
---
You do realize that the game was so bad back in February of 2005, that penny arcade took away their game of the year award to world of Warcraft? The servers were just not up or stable enough to play the game.  When they were up, you had to do sketchy things to get around the queue times.  Knowing all this and all the people that literally would crash the forums on Friday nights because they had nothing to do while in queue, you still want the old systems back?
---
but it does have 100+ worlds

Here is a complete list of chat commands in WoW:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Slash_commands
---
The actual command is 
---
/ban channelnumber/name playername
---
If *playername* is omitted, you ban your current target instead. The command *unban* does the opposite.

Where did you get it? I'd love to buy this but google is failing me
---
Used to be those took place over on the PTR, but I guess that won't work now with the predermined patches :(
---
Blizz rarely if ever go back on large public announcements like this one. The chances they do not remove layering permanently is slim to none. Doom posting like this is not helpful to the community.
---
At the worst, if the sub numbers remain high after a few months they will open up new servers and offer free character transfers and maybe some other perks for doing so.
---
What happened to everyone just being glad that they are opening classic servers in the first place? Classic is going to be great, just stop posting stuff shit talking Blizz when we haven't even got to try it out in its final release yet.
---
Oh no, a streamer is going to fight the streamers and people will go give him views. Asperbald will make views with his rage videos against him, same goes with every raging wow streamer.
---
Everyone wins.
---
AFAIK everyone will be on same AH and Trade Chat even if in different layers. The AH specifically is going to be completely ruined by layering if it lasts as long as people are estimating, because the amount of resources available to players will be way above what it should be.
---
Where's the meme for when 75% of the players quit within a few months out of boredom and the pserver folks that remain blame it on the layering? 
---
Because that's what's already happening. Preemptively blaming the game's failure to retain a large playerbase on something that is only a deal breaker to an extremely niche group.
---
You can buy Gametime in the battle.net store
---
Well if its disrupting an event that's one thing.  In actual classic it isn't against tos so it shouldn't happen.
---
I have lots of gold on my retail account for tokens but I'm not spending any of it until about and hour or 2 before launch.
---
Also current Blizzard made BFA. All the mechanics in BFA? All blizzards ideas. All made it though testing.
---
Being skeptical that Blizzard doesn't know what they're doing is the most logical thing in the world. If a chef serves you up a turd sandwich, and therefore you're really skeptical about his next meal, then that's completely normal. "Oh but i'm a chef, i know what people like!" Yeaaaaaa, but you kinda fucked me by making me eat shit earlier, so sorry for the doubt.
---
Just a real slap in the tits.
---
And if you go to YouTube and search for “Kargoz Classic wow leveling guide 2.0” you can get a pretty good feeling what leveling as a warrior is about.
---
Where are the 50k numbers coming from?
---
I can understand that! best of luck, whichever you choose!
---
And that’s exactly what I am doing along with many others. Avoiding thalnos.
---
Has Classic proven itself to be a success though?  
---
I certainly hope it will, but I've seen enough division and fickle behavior in the WoW community that I'm not going to trust the player base as a whole to actually still want it once they've gotten it and had a few months to play it.  Just because I want it or even that many of us want it does't mean that the community writ large really is going to want it once they have it.
---
[They are sharding](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/covqj1/i_just_got_layered_and_forced_to_start_a_new_group/) still.  Layering will stick you into a world ID and you would remain in that ID.  If your group mates are disappearing, then it is sharding and not layering.
---
26 minutes for the first "git gud" reply. I should have taken the over :)
---
God damn it!
---
Could be real ID friends only, or Bnet friends only, and not just anyone on friends list.
---
That was my biggest takeaway from The WoW Diary. The people outside of developers are operating on very incomplete information. They come to reasonable conclusions based on the information they have, but they rarely admit to themselves that there might be information they don't have that would change their conclusion.
---
We may be seeing sharding, but they have been pretty clear on the fact that they're doing layering. We saw lots of other bugs throughout the beta too, and we will see bugs on live. Ya there will be road bumps, but having layering solves major issues that we still feel the effects of in bfa. 
---
Ultimately I think it's okay if someone misses a copper vein due to a sharding bug. Report it, move on. There were bugs in 2004 too.
---
Yup, this is also the same company who just a few years ago at their own gaming convention that is 95% PC gamers (Hearthstone and Diablo 3 making up the other 5%) asks its fans "do you not have phones?"
---
Hard not to be cynical after that.
---
sorry if im mis understanding but shadowmeld is not a vanish in classic , its a stealth that can only be used out of combat
---
Aber bitte nicht den kosmopolitischen Heiligenschein zuhause liegen lassen!
---
Speculation is that Fairbanks is safe if you're hoping for a PVP server.
---
From memory.
---
I mean, the whole "open lots of servers and just merge low pop ones" is literally exactly what Layering is doing, just virtually / software-side.
---
Blizz just needs to tweak it a bit to be less buggy, and maybe make it so that you can't swap layers on demand (30min cd, or make it so you can only do it at a rest area) and it'll be fine.
---
And honestly, I don't see layering lasting more than a month, based on pserver experiences with 10k+ people online.
---
The Vanilla Experience!!
---
Agreed!  I know Bliz has messed up here and there, but I'm hoping they are being smart about this while hoping they are wrong and Classic surpasses Retail in numbers and remains that way.
---
Cheers Mate ! See yah on 27th , was fun !

---
Hahaha this is awesome.
---
Can we stay on point?
---
Putting my character on a blacklist that will prevent me from getting into a raid for camping a streamer on a PVP server is bullshit. 
---
So if streamers are going to play that card, they deserve to be camped until they go PVE, cause a blacklist for butt hurt streamers is not what the spirit of the game is about...
---
I’m not talking about sniping, that is bullshit. But I’ll be honest, I’ll leave most people alone while leveling unless I’m attacked. But a streamer or anyone from their guild?  Red is dead baby, till they camp or leave or bring in help.
---
&gt; How are Addons going to work?  
---
Depends how the author wrote them. 😂
---
Which is apparantly something that is so hard to understand that every post ends up the same.
---
"Hurr hurr layering bad, bad dev men in office no worky"
---
Yeah, because in vanilla you could only reserve names on one realm two weeks before lunch, right?
---
Thank you. As someone with a high IQ and a large dick, it’s nice to be recognised and thought about. Thank you fellow high IQ and large dick person.
---
Imagine if the long awaited WoW killer turns out to be WoW Classic.
---
Cherrypicking worst-case outcomes doesn't erase the reality that without layering you'd be sitting in a queue experiencing none of it anyway

---
You heard it here folks.  On the subreddit with 170K subs now, this guy is estimating only around 30k active players in Classic NA. 
---
If every single server for NA has a healthy pop of around ~3000, and you some how end up on the one dead server with 600.  That means only 36k active players.  Are you serious?  There are over 100k people actively playing EQ right now.  
---
Don't be ridiculous and learn to do some basic math, man.  Apparently you're with Blizzard on that one though.
---
Take off the “crantze” and thats me
---
whoa haha nice one. got that reference.
---
So this content gets left up but the mods remove threads with shitloads of discussion.  Lol...
---
Nobody knows yet. The streamers will might start announcing where they'll be after name creation tonight. There's only three or four you should try to avoid anyway.
---
The heavy snow in Storm Peaks was just so pretty &lt;3
---
Jawoll, 00:00
---
If you're going to go that far, then you might as well reserve your name, then make a second character to decide your appearance settings and write them down so that you can more quickly remake your character with the proper name and appearance.
---
Alright I will bite, explain how it will have this dramatic effect on a majority of the time playing wow. Factor in that for a significant majority of the people they will interact with, at any given time, the same number of people as they would during the classic launch.
---
That was my experience in BFA too...
---
i was debating whether or not i wanted to resub early just for this but your post knocked some sense into me
---
Cool, benefit the many while destroying the permanent sense of community. 
---
Sounds an awful lot like the retail design philosophy.
---
Wassup guys hope you all are preparing for classic. It'll be interesting to see how it turns out. I'm just writing this post because me and my friends are looking for 2 more people to dungeon grind and level as a group once the 27th hits. Also on the 27th I will be trying to stream for 24 hours so you'd have to be down for that as well. 3 very chill laid back ppl who are down to have fun and grind it out through classic wow and blossom a cool friendship. The people I currently have I have been friends with for years except one, but we are open to new awesome people. If this sounds interesting to you please leave a comment and I can hit you up. BTW WE WILL BE LEVELING HORDE AND WE ARE ROLLING DRUID SHAMMY, MAGE AND POSSIBLY PRIEST. We will be rolling on the FAIRBANKS realm NA PvP. Thank you!
---
Props cause you thought you played a solo game.
---
Jokes aside, try go to SW or Orgrimmar and see if your post holds value still.

How can there be dead realms when there's 6 total?

UD have a PVP trinket (WOTF)

Orcs have DPS trinket (Blood fury)

Thanks dude.  I just spat 7-Up all over my desk.

Shot in the dark - your name isn't Cody is it?
---
Yeah, I don’t know if they can do this, but if it’s possible, it’s a must. That’s where you go to trade with people and chat. Imagine having to swap layers and incur a cooldown just trying to get gear enchanted, or sell somebody your thick leather...
---
I hope this happens, and I hope it's one of his fanbois that does it.
---
Any later and it would be horrible for EU (still bad being at midnight if you have a job). If you put it in the morning for PST, EST would complain that it's while they're at work.
---
Well shoot, what should I do with my pitchfork then?
---
Blizz probably thinks I resubbed for patch 8.2, but it was a) to hopefully get a beta invite, b) to sample the first stress test. 
---
The stress test confirmed my interest in Classic. I've been stalling for time until Aug 27th.
---
Fuck man, that is awful.
---
They could (ironically) leverage their sharding/layering tech, but keep each layer completely independent from the others save common things like player names. From the players' perspective, each layer looks and feels exactly like its own independent server. When it comes time to merge, it's *extremely* easy and quick to do.
---
Thank you, this sub wont swallow that pill though
---
Allez les bleus
---
So everyone seems to forget that they didnt have layering 15 years ago, and the game launched, and we all played it, and it was fine. 
---
Layering is just a COST saving measure for blizzard.
---
just use a leveling guide, follow it to the letter
---
I was here. It was awesome. 27th can’t come soon enough.
---
&gt; lunch day. 
---
Sounds yummy
---
Why don't you show the rest of the pictures where we killed your raid 3 times in a row in Redridge, after you retreated? :D
---
We even gave you time to respawn and heal up :P
---
It's the quote. It references the whole thing about people asking for vanilla and Brack saying "you don't want that. You think you do, but you don't"
---
Not really. For people like me subbing now is stupid. I’m not spending 2 weeks of game time that I’m paying for not playing.
---
I read this in the voice of Kyle. Kyle Broflovski's cousin (South Park)
---
What I am saying is that sharding and layering need to disappear once you hit PvP zones.  Most people won't make it past level 30 anyways.
---
It sure seems like blizzard doesn't know this: Layering is not seemless and it's not fun.  If they think it's fine in the current state (even for just phase 1) they are just plain wrong.
---
That intro lol. Loved this trailer, pretty bad ass and that was Chrome right?
---
I was fearing rolling on Asmons server as well, but then I remembered I play Horde.  So it's not as much of an issue.
---
It wouldn't have worked if they hadn't found the 1.12 backups. But they did and they saw the profitability.
---
I'm down with this solution, it's practical even though people don't like the preferential treatment
---
Yes, blizz should have done this.  They should also have said "we will allow you to profit off of our game, but you must all play on the same server, and announce publicly which one that will be."
---
My husband and I will be rolling on a pve server starting out.  We want to have our own enjoyable classic experience and we both agreed that didn’t include getting ganked because someone made it to 60 before us.  We will be casual though so we are aware of the fact there would be people who get to the higher levels faster than us (jobs, kids, etc) obviously take priority over playing the game.  We normally run on a pvp server but are making the switch to pve for classic.
---
If blizzard decides to add more servers though based off population numbers then we may make some toons on a new pvp server if that’s what they plan to do.
---
Joana's for sure
---
Awesome, thanks. I better get some sleep.
---
i ran my own path to get lvl 10 on stress tests, i'll be using that and then start running vc and keep on dungeoning til 60
---
Sure, no problem with it. Dunno how you'd like to give the credit, but my actual channels are under the name ShirinGaming.
---
Yeah that works, but would be a slightly longer break than my method. You’re right that it could be 1m not 5m though.
---
Any news on the PvE realm side?
---
&gt; I bet there's a shitton of people that will subscribe today just to reserve a name, but there's probably also even more people that are waiting for launch day to re-sub.
---
And that's where trend projection comes in. While they'll never be able to predict the full numbers they'll be able to look at beta numbers, stress test numbers, and name reservations then make a pretty decent prediction at how many people will sub at launch. If reservations are high I fully expect we'll see a post sometime this week about adding some servers.
---
Retail bad 
---
Classic good
---
TeamViewer would require leaving your computer on all day, would it not? Seems wasteful for a game. That said, it is an ingenious solution.
---
You don’t HAVE to create a raid for the hubs to feel alive. The problem is people DID create raids which started centralizing a relatively small group of players. 
---
When people aren’t forming raids in cities (something that won’t be happening often naturally in game), people will be interspersed more evenly across layers.

NA -Eastern- PVP- Horde- Seeking casual guild
---
I am just looking for a guild to play with casually and chat with. I don't have set hours I play as I have a family, full time job, and outside obligations. I usually put a fair amount of time in on my days off from work, but nothing guaranteed or set. I don't mind running content as it comes out if I'm available, but I don't want to be obligated to do so. Again, I'm looking for a very casual environment. I mostly just want to make a few friends. I have no idea what character I'm making yet, but it will be Horde.
---
Ya it's amazing what you remember from back then because you had to, or did it like 5 times on alts. I didn't use one back in the day at all other than thottbot when I had no idea what to do,or look at all the gear I longed for. I also didn't know one existed at the time if it did.
---
Anyone can play how they want, I just think people should try it especially those who have only known the newer versions.
---
I think we just need to sit back and see how launch goes. I agree I was perplexed that the main cities were really dead (Org and UC for me) and then Brill was popin. I'm hopeful that this was them testing out the layering and getting data. That's what I need to remind myself, is at the end of the day this was a stress test. 
---
I still had plenty of interactions and saw a ton of chat in game. I randomly joined plenty of groups to kill a quest mob and had great interactions. Let's save the pitchforks for launch.
---
As someone with Agoraphobia and severe Enochlophobia, I need my safe space layer. 😭
---
Not really. There isn't a single Vanilla addon that will work for Classic without a complete rewrite.
---
This is too liberal and not right wing enough
---
Gotta be in peak physical condition so your body will take longer to breakdown from inactivity/junk food once classic is live.
---
So is it possible to farm Twilight text  early
---
Yup. I foresee demand being too much and blizzard opening new servers. My group agreed to bail and go to the new servers.
---
Good philosophy. Don't complain until disaster happens. I wish you will use your own advice in any dangerous situation in your life.
---
They always have more data. It doesn't mean they are smarter than thousands of people, who have learned a fucking lesson. Actually they've proved that many times during last decade. And you still can't learn, boy.
---
Well the good news is that they should be able to turn it off like a switch. I just hope they realize when to.
---
that is easily one of the dumbest assumptions you can make in life.
---
I used it to great success, and I enjoy that guide the most.  Specifically because it’s a pretty loose guide that doesn’t tell you to every single little step - it makes sure you don’t miss any pre-read you fill in any of the the gaps such as class quests yourself.
---
That makes it less useful for speed leveling, but pretty damn slick for casual leveling.
---
You cant subscribe using Bnet balance (because subscribe implies RECURRING. Balance is not "recurring".
---
You can buy a X-day subscription (non-recurring) using balance.
---
It has been this way forever.
---
They are realm specific. If you're not sure shit your realm make sure to reserve the name on the 3 top choices

Tried to get to winterspring myself to bid farewell from my favoriate zone. Underestimated how long it would take to get through felwood dying every 10 feet, so my tauren's final moments were spent at the felwood graveyard with red gear and res sickness.
---
lol no....
---
Smoke some fuckin crack with me bro!
---
I just resubbed but the selection box above "install" doesn't appear for me. I'm guessing I've gotta download retail for it to come up?
---
Ja moin!

I'd cut my right arm if it was 6 month away. I give it 3 months maximum.

It really doesn't.  That is why you are sitting on a public forum chatting about it.  The professionals that deal with MMOs, design, administer, and make million dollar decisions about the game are doing it this way.

A stupid request that's easy, is still stupid. Stop being a retard.

It's absolutely worth it if it keep the server from going to shit
---
The challenge.  Died like 3 times in Skull Rock from stuff respawning on top of me.  I miss the cautious approach to questing.
---
Why do you need more servers again?
---
Q: Will there be a population cap on the servers? As in: do I need to register a name to make sure I will get to play on a specific server?
---
The TBC change was to standardize all dungeons to five members. After 1.10, they were *individually* labelled as 5-man. Kind of a fell swoop thing that probably cut out lines of code for efficiency sake.
---
you have much more mental energy to apply to these concerns than i do
---
Blizzard knew a ton and still produced Warlords of Draenor and BFA. For both of thos people said " In short, everyone is freaking out  for no reason, wait for launch, if everything is fucked after launch  then complain. Right now Blizzard knows more than you." Then it just sucked and killed the game.
---
That I can agree, I don’t think they should be demanding it or “deserve” it but I would be shocked if blizzard didn’t let them because of what it means for blizzard.

Has anything been said about where the streamers are all going for servers?

Relevant username
---
oh ok. And which realm will you be playing on? Just curious.
---
The main one being layering in and out of world pvp situations. People layer hopping while gathering mining or herbing. Going through south shore with nothing happening while on another layer there is a massive pvp battle. “Rare” recipes from vendors &amp; dropped from mobs being rare no more due to multiple layers. Major cities feeling super alive. Also apparently general chat doesn’t even go accrosss layers. This is not vanilla.
---
Also - how can you say you would see “most of the players” when they’re a likely to be 10+ layers while leveling.  Once again, it is critical that everyone be able to see EVERY player on the server at all times for it to have that vanilla feeling. 
---
Maybe merging isn’t the best solution, but it’s definitely better than layering.  An even better solution would just be to add a bunch more servers and cap then at 10k players for launch. That way if we lose 50-60% of players after launch, voila, perfect sized community
---
Put graphics to max, but reduce ground clutter to 6/7 ... On 10, there is simply too much ground clutter.
---
Yeah im looking for lists of every class hopefully. I know which phases pvp vendor items are obtainable, but I'm pretty sure a lot of raid drop items are better than pvp items.
---
well, it's the second indicator
---
as the stress test was the first indicator
---
and launch will be the final indicator
---
[Security through Obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) never works.
---
well for one, given the tech and capacity of servers today compared to 2005, hundreds of people in the same spot shouldnt be to much of an issue. Not to mention shitty private servers could pull of insane open world pvp battles unless you play on a literal toaster of a pc.
---
Or just tell people upfront you're drunk and gay so they don't get offended
---
Ye, should have included that 😃
---
Sounds it could have been part of the notorious [SSC](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_Sport_Clips)
---
Do you really believe that the same level of traffic on the launch of Classic will be there for different content releases? Absolutely no way the content releases will be as popular.
---
Pretty sure they’ll just wait until you have to go to work, lol.
---
It doesn’t matter how many people are trying to do it, you will all be facing the same difficulties and even more pushback from people that support the streamers. You won’t win
---
whooooosh
---
It's a legit sport channel which shows the "sexy sport clips" or something like this at night time. You are probably talking about  the channel DSF. Hope that answers your question
---
Looks the closest to what people are talking about on EU.

I have no dog in this fight.  But I will say that Blizzard has said "this will be changing once it's live'" before, and it ended up being a lie.   They have, in fact, said that more than once.
---
I took the week off. Monday will be naps and food prep buntil launch. I will probably spend 24 hours getting ahead of the crowd, then slow down a bit.
---
Yes but all of them together along with the things like I know the Brazilians are on Thanlos I believe, and we are probably going to get like a ton of people flooding this sub asking questions about where people are and what to avoid and it should avoid the 900 million new thread on: streamer X is going to be on this server that are going to start later today.

---
Thank you devs &lt;3
---
it's because polish was once germany, it was split back in the day
---
Ah alright. I get what you mean, though I can't imagine you will have any problem finding people on the PvE servers. Sure it will be less people certainly, but not dead. That's what I think anyhow.
---
Good luck finding a place you feel comfortable in. :)
---
Why are you assuming that scales like that? There could be a high population of mostly new/casual people causing an influx of layers with only a handful of people actually farming some rare. I mean, especially in the beginning at least, I could definitely see this being exploited. We'll see though. Hopefully it all works out.
---
Weird it looks like it's signed mom
---
Yea fuck, me for wanting a real classic WoW. lmfao, this shit will end up just like retail as long as people like you are around to stick around sucking blizzards cocks
---
transfers and server merging sound way more damaging to realm communities than layering ever will be
---
alternate theory: they've already reserved their names on one server through early reservation, but they'll act like they reserved names along with all of us
---
Minor stuff like this is really annoying.  It's a small change that helps the success of WoW classic.  You can't tell me it's so much trouble to add a single button to that UI instead of their dropdown that people won't notice unless you are looking for it.
---
Can confirm: I saw someone spilling shit about Jews yesterday... Other times indeed.
---
Learn first aid
---
The whole point of layering is to end up with exactly what you described...The alternative is to have dead servers once the population declines. I genuinely don't understand how people don't realize what layering is for at this point.
---
It is a temporary solution to the problem of inevitable population decline. If there's no layering, they need more servers on launch. In a few months, when the pop declines, a large majority of those communities will be dead or dying.
---
You referred to « Buff Mod » : is it a different AddOn? In that case, I guess of course multiple AddOns exists and sort buffs and debuffs the way I described, but I would like to have the same skin as CT [Colored]. Sorry if I wasn’t clear il the first place.
---
Unless I understood you wrong and the AddOn you mention has this exact skin?
---
They could add x amount of days to ”returning/new” players so people dont feel bad about subscribing now just to reserve a name 😁
---
Where x is the amount of days until launch
---
I have no idea. I think people are afraid they're going to be speaking spanish generally instead of english
---
Well that’s sure comparing apples to apples. Letting someone have a name that affects basically no one being compared to rich people raping people, holy fuck.
---
Oh ok so just transfer off of the realm that you spent all of your time playing on, meeting people, and building community? And on the flip side just cannonball into some other players already developed community?
---
Clearly this has negatives its not like you found some obvious solution nobody has thought of..
---
Yes they do. Not many people speak English in Spain.
---
No, they don't. And their metrics for guessing Classic's population are flawed. The VAST majority of players don't participate in the stress tests or beta. They don't resub just for a chance. They don't post on the forums. They'll just silently show up in MASSES on launch.
---
Blizzard needs to double the servers...at the very least. More like triple or probably more than that. And that's after the slight dropoff when a few tourists leave.
---
I would have tried to keep it quiet too. Can you imagine how pissy people would be if Blizz straight up said, "yeah, we let them in first because we're using them for the free advertising. Everyone else can wait in line"? Most people, like the guy above me, don't even know it happened lol.
---
Couple weeks is being generous
---
I can't tell if I should be scared or not.
---
I hope the bosses that each realm is naked after drops more loot in their own realm.
---
That'll make Zandalari tribe a lot more popular
---
That's not for everyone, plenty of us build social bonds in trade chat. Plenty of us are well off with our guild and other "allied" guilds. It's anecdotal, but the only people I really met through leveling we're off. I'd ignore them, then they jump onto alts and continue messaging me. The large majority of us are trying to get to 60 to do end game content, and will really worry about the heavy social aspect then, as a guild, when recruitment and social ties actually matter.
---
Just remember the game will be here for you when you're ready.

---
I shared an account with my big bro back in the day when classic came out. While he was clearing bwl I was still leveling, while he was clearing aq, I was still leveling. It’s going to be a brand new classic for me to grind to 60 within the first month. I’ll finally be able to experience all of classic wow goodness and I couldn’t be more excited. Glad to hear you enjoyed it!
---
And sorry there's no nongerman version of the article. Basically it's sporty soft porn

It's got nothing to do with being bad.

You are suggesting 1 person playing 10 characters will always beat 10 people playing 10 characters.

---
I mean they should expect as much demand as they would on any other Xpac launch day . I imagine theres a ton of people like me and come back every time theres an Xpac , or in this case - Classic .
---
Weißwurst is kacke? Das ist sowas von Rassistisch!
---
it wasnt easy to make it to level 10
---
I mean... The short answer is "mostly".  You'll still have those same people in your community that were there before, unlike Layering where you lose community members at random as they or you switch layers.
---
Obviously that's a good question though.  Many people have had bad or just plain rotten  experiences with server merges.  However I think for plenty of people it hasn't been bad at all.  You get an influx of new players, but the people you've grown to know are still there.
---
I think part of the experience of previous server merges is the server is *already* dying when merged, so it's a biased sample size.  I don't like Sprite because I used to always drink it when I had the flu/ sick to my stomach.  Does that mean Sprite is bad or makes me sick?  Please keep in mind I'm not trying to dismiss merging complaints, only put them in perspective.
---
Heavily layered.
---
Can't wait :D
---
Can someone tell me what layering is? If I make a character on a server does layering put me in another server with less people?
---
&gt; It's a feature
---
Yeah Chromie is the one pushing the button:)
---
Not specific to rogues but, don't waste gold on skills you won't immediately use.
---
Shouldn't have to. Relaunch bnet?
---
Name changes...and all the mats you've been saving are worth 1/4 as much, or the mats you need are double. 
---
It's the difference of putting 4th and 5th graders together from the same school vs moving kids from a low population school to another. You know the kids in your school, now instead you're one of "those new kids"
---
I agree. No one (but me) should go priest.
---
Yeah the level cap money bonus was there so everyone at 15 made like 50s per quest or more, there was lots of money going around in the economy and it rotated mostly around crafting mats, pots and such.
---
Thanks?
---
/shrug
---
The real answer is that we don't know. There were some examples of buggy layers which sound terrible, like with your group suddenly getting phased. But we don't know how much of that is impact of weird stress test limits designed around lower pop.
---
"We'll find out when the game goes live" is the only real answer here.
---
It does. Thank you.
---
Whatever it takes.
---
I was playing Saturday night and was questing outside of Crossroads horde side. A mob of Alliance came and ganked me. Questing ended, the horde zerg showed up, and it turned into a back and forth bloodbath which ended at Ratchet. I wasn't trying to group with people, but I was having the same experiences your talking about. I never switched layers.
---
Duh.
---
Level lock picking to 85 before you do the poison quest so you can farm the lock box in the tower in westfall. If you complete the poisons class quest, you won’t be able to use the lock box.
---
Also need to survive to enjoy the rewards of the grind.
---
Personally it was the barebones nature of it. You weren't coddled with anything, but at the same time you had everything you need.
---
The most egregious example was always just barely scraping by to buy my spells. Inventory management was also a real task.
---
Hes not wrong though, trying to find tanks and healer, even if you had one was a pain in the ass for heroics.  I would sit in vent at my desk doing my class work and be sitting at the summoning stone with this other girl, who I am still friends with to this day, for over an hour.  You had to have people ready to summon with one person spamming chat saying what we had and that we had a summon ready to go.  The guild leader we had at the time was MT and on the weekends would run heroics non stop for people for like 16 hours Saturday and Sunday.  You had to go on the website the week before and sigh up for which heroics you needed to do.  Not only that, but we had to find a healer most of the time.  It was all a pain in the ass.  To this day, I am pretty sure there are heroics I never did in bc because they were a pain in the ass and no one ever wanted to do them.
---
Most people will not be rushing to hit 60 in under a week.
---
And joining streamer gank squads will be a good way to break up the monotony of leveling.
---
That's when a lot of people quit. There was a very long drought of content before the Sunwell patch. WoW 2004-2007ish probably the best time in WoW history imo.
---
Same for me and my boys, all of us have chosen Herod because it seems to be the community server, people yelling it in the general chats throughout the stress test as well
---
What cost saving measures are you referring to? Incremental servers don't cost anything.
---
Id say russians are the BR of EU
---
But even the people putting in more effort will still have a higher/quicker chance of getting it. Making the item not as rare as it once was and depending on what it is, it could become very over powered.
---
Streaming isn't a job. People who think it is should be corpse camped. Maybe they'll go back to current WOW where they belong.
---
They probably had people manually hitting a layer button and then gathered a ton of data like how many characters died within 1 minute of the layer switch, how much of X resource appeared in players inventory over the next minute vs the average of the previous hour, etc.
---
That's cause they never got into from the queue ;)
---
You can't put X or XX at the end of your name. I tried.
---
Yep, still frieds with some of them on FB. Tageris, Trystin and them. If you remember we actually won the WSVG UD Strat race up in Dallas together!
---
Cata completely ruined the game.
---
well the testing of the layering showed its apparently phenomenally flawed
---
"we have more servers ready in case you fill them up"
---
I guess the problem is what do they consider filled up. They have a guesstimate on how many players will continue playing and it seems like currently they assume like 90% of players will leave before p1 ends judging by a rough estimates of how many player interest there is currently and how many players there would need to stay for all the servers to stay fully populated end of p1.
---
My guess is the vast majority will pretty much make characters on d1, and if they add servers later they will never get to the population of the first ones and possibly end up D.O.A.
---
Oh 100% on this one.  Especially in this case they should tell us where they'll roll before-hand.  I don't even care if they have their names reserved already - it doesnt bother me at all.  I just want to know where I can play in peace.
---
Delet this
---
Maybe we should all leave some love and support on their channel! They’re only small, I’m so glad I stumbled upon it!! 
---
Whatever it takes!
---
What is apes?
---
/who the city. People are out playing.
---
It's more likely that most people that played the game on launch were mid to late 20s myself included.
---
Would rather wait 30 seconds to avoid a queue with thousands of people for like 5-10 minutes. But for sure, the server realm lest refreshes by itself without me having to re log in?
---
If that is so, then I stand corrected.
---
That sounds about right, because it was normal until like after 10PM or something. Sweden really has to step up it's game.
---
[Same](https://i.imgur.com/dH2PxYm.png) but I have the option to install classic?
---
There is no difference, that's part of why multiboxing is considered cheating.
---
You can teach a monkey or a 3-year old to press one button and you as a person with 5 characters will beat a multiglad 3000 rating player 100 out of 100 times by press one button.
---
There is in most areas in which you find a multiboxing shaman no skill involved.
---
You press one button and people topple over by being nuked by 7000damage every 6seconds.   
---
I have gripes with both the person multiboxing and the people supplying the multiboxers. 
---
Kinda like narcotic addicts. They are bad for destroying families, communities etc. But the suppliers are bad as well for - well - supplying the drug.
---
Obviously this is only an analogy, I know that taking such drugs is infinitely worse than multiboxing in a 15year old game.
---
Thank you!!! I've been practicing.
---
Shazzra/ Executus : Shattrath/Exodus

Pure speculation based on early iterations of layering in the beta.

2 according to their own official naming policy, linked from their own website?
---
So here's the really funny thing: Gutterspeak uses the same scrambling algorithm as Common. An orc will hear "lol" translated to "bur" in both languages. Given that the language is actually the same, you're left to imagine why a zombie and a human can't communicate. 
---
Personally, I imagine the hoarse moaning of a zombie may literally be saying words in Common, but humans won't be willing or able to make it out. Likewise, an undead isn't used to hearing clearly spoken Common and it might be spoken too fast or with the wrong intonations. I imagine it like hearing a Welsh person with a heavy accent speak English; they're literally saying English words, but fuck me if I can understand them.
---
As for learning Orcish, I think there's a bit of a missed opportunity. It's an interesting dynamic that Undead start with only neutral reputation for the other factions, while Night Elves (similarly distant) start with friendly. They could reinforce this by starting Undead speaking Gutterspeak by default, and either have a quest to learn the Orcish language (by an emissary in Brill or something) or else just leave it up to another player to explain the mechanic (thus "teach" them Orcish).

\*\*&lt;Guide&gt; - Shazzrah- Alliance\*\*
---
\*\*Language\*\*
---
English
---
\*\*Guild Type\*\*
---
Hardcore raiding Guild
---
\*\*About us\*\*
---
We are a new guild composing of hardcore players from different Vanilla private servers. We have banded together to form a hardcore guild, that will succeed in Classic WoW with achieving server firsts and fast speed runs.
---
\*\*About you\*\*
---
\-    Cozy person with a hardcore mindset
---
\-    Able to maintain high raid attendance (atleast 90%)
---
\-    Able to give/take constructive criticism - Everybody makes mistakes, just don’t make them twice
---
\-    Show interest prior to Classic Release. We have a test server running, where everybody is welcome to test out different builds or items.
---
\*\*Class Demand\*\*
---
Warrior - medium
---
Paladin - medium
---
Mage - medium
---
Warlock - low
---
Priest - high
---
Druid - high
---
Rogue - high
---
Hunter - low
---
We are always looking for exceptional players of any class!
---
\*\*About the loot system\*\*
---
We will be using a transparent loot system, which will be decided by the class leaders - the loot council system. With the loot sheet, you will be able to track, who will be getting that next DFT or Mageblade, and who will be getting that item next after that person.
---
\*\*What can you expect from us?\*\*
---
A relaxed guild with focus on the hardcore scene. Always room for fun and jokes outside of the raiding, but during raiding there will be 110% focus. We will always strive to be better than yesterday, and become even better tomorrow.
---
\*\*Preliminary raid schedule: (CE(S)T)\*\*
---
Wednesday: 19:00-23:00
---
Thursday: 19:00-23:00
---
Monday: 19:00-23:00
---
We won’t be using the other raid days in the beginning, but we will try to hold events here, that would help the guild as a whole. Examples; farming UBRS for flask recipe, funny times in the Crater or farming pre-bis items with low drop chance for guildies. In the future, we plan to do split raiding, and this is where, these days will be used mostly.
---
Hope we have caught your attention!

I resubbed for this. 7.50 won't hurt me that badly, you gotta live with your name for a long time after all.
---
That's why I was happy they extended it as much as they did. I would've only had opportunity to test a handful of race/class combinations. Now I did everything I wanted to try and then got my favorite to L9.
---
So why is shadow a “meme spec” let’s say you have 5 locks pulling 600 dps which is probably realistic in early raids. Shadow priest doing 500. Shadow weaving will increase those locks by 90 each x 5 is another 450 dps bringing the priest to 950 which is damn good dps in pre raid gear. Before someone says “but healzbot can do it”... it lasts 15 seconds and needs to stack 5 times. No healer can maintain that and still heal.
---
As far as im concerned LookingforGroup is a place to BS with others :)
---
It really do be like dat sometimes
---
if you play feuer frei you better start up ur bandicam before you go killing spree.
---
When they destroyed the world with Cata, they destroyed the World... of Warcraft.
---
I don't think it's going to be that impactful, because specially during first weeks the layers you hop to are also crowded and depleted.

This is the sort of dogshit that killed retail wpvp.
---
It was an issue and still is going to be on release. Did you play the stress test?
---
And miss out on a those "48 hour straight - no sleep" streams plus tons ad revenue and donations? If they fail to capture at audience at the beginning, the people that want to watch streams will simply find someone else. For some of these guys, this is a large source of income. I can't fault them for making money. Hate the game, ya know?
---
At least one seems to understand the situation.
---
Yeah, I was gonna resub for the name, but I would have had to take my computers on holidays and it just wasn't worth it. And if I'm not ready to do it, lots of casual players won't be either.
---
in most established guilds the tank spots will already be filled
---
They are not the same no. Even tho you are phased into a layer doesn't mean it's the same. With phasing you could have it in the low lvl zones only you can't with layering.
---
Servers are permanent. Layers are constantly changing. If a bug occurs, it's possible for one layer to only hold a few people because of some weird combination of variables.
---
If I'm on a server, there are going to be people in Org. If I'm on a layer, I might end up in one where the majority of players are in the barrens. 
---
A lot of what blizz has promised about layers hasn't turned out to be true. Now obviously that's most likely because of the stress tests, but blizz has a record and it creates a lot of worry.
---
If layering worked the way its supposed to I could wait out a month until it went away. But I still worry that I'll be shunted into a different layer while I'm in the middle of taming a rare, or that I won't see any other player a second time while leveling, or that I'll get stuck in a bugged layer where there's no other players around me.
---
And that's not to mention the ways people are going to abuse the layers. Rare pets aren't going to be as rare as they should be if people are switching between 10 different layers trying to find them.
---
hast recht. da fehlen hoorische mit specksooß und dibbelabbes mit stambes.
---
It really bugs me that people talk about layering like it doesn't exist for a very specific reason.
---
Esfand was 12 when Vanilla came out. The idea that he's somehow connected to vanilla in anyway shape or form is absurd to point of ridiculousness.
---
Honestly 4-8pm eastern will probably be the a normal raid time. Most of the west is streamers,  so you can jump in with them when they wake up at noon.
---
Yeah I used to like this sub. Now it's a massive circlejerk. I guess this is the fate of all subs
---
Haha. It looks like meat is back on the menu boys! I'll definitely be hanging out with gramps
---
Romania - Slavic country that speaks Russian... how illiterate are you?
---
&gt; Isn't this "legend" a streamer himself? I guess he's going to cry a lot?
---
Some streamers are good and don't encourage their followers to participate in "ban lists"
---
Some streamers are bad and do encourage their followers to participate in "ban lists".
---
Real simple stuff.
---
Yep, use the search bar.
---
" -Blizzard has said layering will last for phase 1 only, there is no reason to believe otherwise" the reason people are skeptical is because they have said something and not done it in the past. 
---
For example go to their 8.0 Q/A's where Ion said some classes would be getting slight revamps in 8.1 because they do not feel great to play such as enhance shamans. 8.1 came rolling around and all they got were damage tuning. Blizzard has said things and not done them in the past. That is why people are skeptical.
---
haha thats awesome, glad to hear that you're all well and still connected!
---
Can you post your data to back this up
---
&gt; I know I re-subbed
---
Please remember that anecdotes are absolutely not indicative iof the greater population/trend.
---
Rip Rich, I love u 3000.
---
Until release from what I can understand.
---
I happened to play on the unofficial Spanish server in Vanilla. They are nice ppl, atleast most i've met, however a ton of them don't speak english or don't want to speak English. And yes, they will talk Spanish generally if they haven't changed in the last 15 years.
---
13 servers , and like 30 “big” streamers ...
---
Just deal with it
---
Not really, the layers are eventually supposed to be merged right. So sure 100 people - dropoff but that's still substantially more than 10.
---
If each layer was supposed to be equivalent to one whole server then we wouldn't need any layering right just 50 servers with a low pop cap. They aren't the same, one layer is separating a chunk of the server pop in order to combat over populated zones, that's why the goal is to remove by phase 2. 
---
This is simply a limitation of their layering tech as it must include the whole continent as opposed to separate zones. In this case there ARE 100 people in Org you just can't see them and want too. Same as how there are 100 people in Westfall that you can't see but actually don't want too.
---
I was surprised with how many proper working addons were available for testing.
---
Thanks to all those dedicated hard working creators out there.
---
Let me know if any of you ever need a tank for stratholme.
---
They are wielding Hunter weapons.
---
What is the financial incentive to keep layering when they have said out loud its not something they plan to keep long term and have acknowledged the community isnt the biggest fan of?
---
They say layering is the best option to ensure a smooth launch experience and a smooth launch is essential for player retention. Once the initial surge of people in the starting zones smooths out, its not needed and will go away, and it will go away no later than Phase 2 (possibly sooner).
---
Ya,  like that..  but with information.
---
The highly satisfied customer would be more willing to talk about how great the product is to their friends who currently aren't subbed.
---
Grobbulus too swag to be memed.
---
I'm extremely curious to see how Classic affects BfA. I'd love to see an "hours played" chart of some sort after a month or two.
---
Typically, yes.
---
You only need 2-4 tanks per 40 man, so the spots get filled quick and if one opens up it gets filled by someone who's already in the guild.
---
Your best bet is to join as dps and volunteer to tank whenever possible.
---
FAIRBANKS IN THIS BIH
---
FTOWN REPRESENT YOU KNOW HOW WE DO
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
Dosn't really matter, worst case cenario you can just delete it at the day of release &amp; remake it quickly haha?
---
You seem to be an advocate for toxic behaviour. Tell me if you agree with this statement .
---
"If people didn't want to hear racial and sexist slurs they should have maturity filter on."
---
Yeah, off the 28-2nd.
---
Dont forget MT Dew, Pizzas and Bawls energy drinks
---
Thanks all for the advice!
---
it could be sniped
---
you are not alone.
---
But created characters IS population statistics. You are kind of contradicting your first sentence...
---
What is the purpose of a "stress" test when you lower the threshold for layers purposefully to make the server/client less stressful.   Please don't downvote me, I'm just asking a question.
---
My own brain... seriously why spoil the fun and be hand held through the game. I'm even doing an odd hybrid spec that I didnt see mentioned anywhere. Sure I'll change to a more standard healing spec for raiding, but leveling it's not dire.
---
World PvP is a big part of the vanilla experience. It's almost a different game if you remove it.
---
I don’t understand why there should be layering. Vanilla didn’t have layering? It ruins the fun of getting to know certain people on your server. There used to be some really cool people that were the best of their class in the server.  Every now and then you’d run into them and give them a /wave. 
---
It shouldn’t be difficult to add new servers into classic. Servers should have a player cap and not layering.
---
I've been fishing in minecraft to fill the time!  I can't wait to see that bobber pop!
---
$15 for a month's (four weeks) subscription of which I will only use two weeks, since I have no interest in playing BfA.
---
If this aint me in 60 years i definitely did this whole life thing wrong
---
Lmao pretty funny. Insert standard profiling pedophile comment here
---
Just remember that Ragnaros is not a Brazilian server..
---
I’m all in it.
---
Where is that?
---
The best part about aoe leveling with a priest is that the priest can take all the killing blows and get a really high spirit tap uptime. Paladin/priest duo have worked great for me just aoeing everything.
---
Raids want some of all classes though, you need hunters for enrage and melee love Truestrike.
---
Thor's quote over the dropping numbers was great.
---
Oo I see
---
As you can see in the Night Elf Stealth - 5 MoD screenshot, the Night Elf is standing two “planks” or approximately 3 feet away, so stacking more effects (boots, cloak enchant), or having a lower level opponent, should allow him to get even closer before being seen. Unfortunately I won’t be able to test that out until the game goes live.
---
What financial benefit is there to keep layering though? They said they don't want to keep it long term and they know the community doesn't want it.
---
For clarity, you can create random chars that you delete during launch and quickly re-create. Though during that time for 1 sec it is up to grabs.
---
Why else would I leave than if I don't enjoy the game? I lived a happy life the last 4 years (and a bunch of years in between before) without WoW, if Classic doesn't cut it for me I'm not gonna stick to it like a junkie. I'm not setting a deadline, I'll play as long as I enjoy it and quit when I don't.
---
And they also have to use extreme render culling and other tricks to do it.
---
It's not smart to pretend to be a WoW engineer or assume running a pserver is anything like running an actual server
---
&gt; Like the whole supposition that nobody casual is on reddit
---
The statement was that most people on reddit are not casual.  It doesn't mean ALL people are hardcore or that there are NO casual players.  It means that if you are sitting on reddit all the time posting about a game, you're more likely to take that game seriously and not just be a "casual" player.
---
Hemo was shit untill ur naxx geared/hwl so u could wait a bit for that ;)

I'm just not certain as to what a stress test is, I assumed it would be an indicator as to how things would be at launch.
---
Hardcover is worth, I got it and it's great looking.
---
Layering isn't attractive for many reasons, its a huge financial advantage in game for the first people to reach max level, if the die off that blizzard expects doesnt happen, we are left with an incredibly imbalanced server, or layering forever, many of us would rather deal with "the suck" for a week and move on.  Beta and stress tests have done nothing to dispel any of this, It's also considered by many to be one of the major problems with retail, it's a lazy design feature to make up for a lack of content for the player base to spread out over while leveling, and one of the things that made Vanilla special was how it pushed you towards grouping rather than solo play, which is the exact opposite of what layering does.
---
I too leveled 2 15s on the stress test except I noticed layering. Especially when I invited my wife to my group numerous times and we literally stood on top of each other and couldn’t see each other. 
---
Maybe this was because they were testing something? Who knows I guess...though from what I’ve seen it’s not very promising.
---
Never has been and never will be the case.
---
Or they just add a few more servers when it is actually known to be necessary?
---
Same here, my original has changed servers, races, factions, names. Literally all of it. I'm gonna try and go for my original name but like who cares if it gets taken?
---
/cringe
---
Just log in after launch and do it.
---
Funny because guilds were always supposed to be on the same layer. This will really irk me as we have over 70 people confirmed for our guild already.
---
Wo ist der Schweizer und Ösi Einfluss... typisch Piefke wiedermal
---
I made a comment similar to this when the released the news. I think part of the answer is that the total cap is closer to 10k which gives about 3k concurrent peak. Combine that with servers in other regions of other types (25 total, it means they expect 250k population at least as the stable population.
---
Luna, the unitframes work at the moment. Other stuff is still broken, think that black corners actually work.
---
It’s continent wide
---
What you want a separate sub for classic?
---
I just got admited at the Salamanca's conservatory because the motivation of wow classic :3
---
&gt; How many players do you expect to be playing classic January 2020?
---
Blizzard probably has done more market research regarding that number than you have.
---
Without even realising it i also have launch booked off. Superb.
---
No. Layering creates copies of a server to handle more than the server could hold. For instance, a server might only be able to handle 5k people. On launch, there will at least tens of thousands on each server, possibly more. Rather than making you sit in a login queue for 2 hours to get in, layering spins up new instances of a server that can handle 5k each. Everything you do in the layer is saved to the main server
---
But who wants to be transferred to a low pop realm?
---
The stress test isn't representative of a normal server though. Level 15s that are going to be imminently deleted don't really have a reason to be in major cities the way permanent characters - with professions and a reason to be on the AH - would.
---
Depends what you are stressing: number of layer, edge cases, layer hoping, etc
---
QA/QC is complicated in large projects
---
It isn't, don't worry
---
Do you know how bugs get fixed? Because people report them. Do you know what this post is?
---
I saw all these people die.
---
I left my mage lying on a tombstone at the Sepulcher. I'll be back again to visit soon.)
---
To clarify- it's dont disrespect same faction RP. If I see Ladaric in Ashenvale with his buddies speaking their unintelligible language, I'm going to get my buddies and cleanse Azeroth of the Horde filth. 
---
Also with only one RPPVP server, faction balance looks to be perfectly 50:50. That'll really help keep wPVP alive along with the RP elements that also help bolster it.
---
Packing bowls = xp waste
---
Dude I’m sorry I know you called yourself out already but this question honestly warrants flaming. It is a cold hard fact that they will not be rebalancing classes, so that’s out the window already. So you’re just looking for opinions on this fact? It would be terrible. There is no way they could rebalance the classes without retuning bosses, which takes a lot of care and thought, even for classic raids. I wish classes could have been more balanced from the beginning, but they weren’t, so we are better off leaving them alone.
---
I really enjoyed the grit and patience all my deadmines groups showed. Ran it three times with a minimum of 4 hours each time. Super enjoyable and made quite a few btag friends.
---
well at least after the queue there is the real thing, not some retail vanilla hybrid.
---
Do you seriously think that classic will have anywhere near as many players 2 month from now as it will at launch?
---
why do you need to gatekeep this game so hard? 
---
what do you get out of it?
---
Same. I hope someone finds a way!
---
I don't spend $50 on a book.
---
Idk why all the layering defenders think the only other alternative is this hellish nightmare of having enough servers for the players. The entire demand behind classic servers was this fond memory of organically running into and befriending those around you and seeing the same set of names around. Like a world of warcraft.
---
Take their same layering tech and make it voluntary. Now there's a whitemane-1 through whitemane-5 to pick from for servers at character creation. Pop goes down? Merge a couple whitemanes together. The only reason they don't do this strategy that requires the exact same amount of tech investment is because it requires them to put in a little bit of effort and be proactive about long term problems. But they only care for the short term so now I get to wander around stormwind the ghost town and wonder why my friends keep fading in and out
---
Either they go back on their word and keep layering in the game or they open more servers and offer free character transfers to/from over or under populated realms.  The latter is how they did it in vanilla the first time around.
---
Agreed. They basically are cheating by paying for a huge advantage to easily win. But they pay out the ass monthly so marketing &amp; sales love them.
---
Damn you messed up. Nothing is going to top smoking weed and grinding my WoW character while listening to new Tool music.
---
They have definitely broke things
---
Blizzard also thought we wouldn't want classic and they were wrong.
---
Who says it will be low pop?
---
Realistically, everything hinges on what happens at release as that is the defacto starting point for everyone's characters.  So that being the default seems appropriate.
---
Romanian is a Roman(Latin) language. They go where Italy, Spain and so on is going.
---
Its just a pvp server with less people and if you walk into the right inn you can sext with 40 year old men
---
Is there an article that confirms the 75k max server capacity?  I'm not saying you're wrong, I just haven't seen it and would like to read it.  Thx.

It's layering, which is a realm wide shard. You'll move between layers only when you accept a group inv or possibly after relogging. There's no way to manually switch, and there's an internal cooldown to how often you can switch. If you see someone on a layer you'll always see them as long as you both remain on that layer. 
---
General and trade chat are cross layer, same with the auction house.
---
There is an option in the settings
---
Whatever gets you motivated. Good for you.
---
of course, those retailers wouldn't come for their 2 week nostalgia trip if they had to spend extra on it.
---
It's still a good idea imo. My warrior is going to be one. Can charge unsuspecting people from stealth. Can guard flags in bgs. Can eat food or go afk in the world without worry. And with all the deaths you can run back quicker.
---
While I agree to an extent, it's not like people are complaining just to complain 
---
Feedback is feedback, regardless of whether it's constructive or not
---
Nah fuck it dude I say let the whining win and have Blizzard remove layering. When everyone logs in all excited, having taken paid time off work, prepared everything, and then have to sit in a 8 hour queue to get in any server then they’ll come crawling back asking for a fix
---
I'm externally screaming just watching this
---
I don't fully believe Blizzard knows everything, just the other day on the conference call J. Allen Brack stated that: "...there's a lot of excitement around Classic, and it's really exceeded our expectations already..."
---
They're already admitting the interest in classic has taken them by surprise
---
[source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-atvi-earnings-conference-190151328.html)
---
I get it pal, I understand how it all works.  The fact that Blizz and the streamers have a symbiotic relationship is completely beside the point.  Streamers should have enough respect for fellow gamers and their potential audience to tell us where they will be playing before character reservation.  Even if that means the streamers will have to use other names in-game (which we are mostly in agreement that they probably already have reserved).  Not doing so is disrespectful to the community.

Paul Stanley - Live to Win on repeat is all I need
---
Yes they have merged both servers and battlegroups. Merging servers seems like a much better idea to me. It's better to force people together then to force people apart. What happens when the split servers is they offer a free transfer then when not enough people take them, they force people to transfer. It's not a good way to go imho
---
Blizzard knows more than you, you are a FUCKING RETARD........... BRO do u know how smart blizzard is.. like they have statistics bro you just dont get it.
---
DID YOU get a 13 year degree on running servers?? think not.
---
The highly intelligent engineers at blizzard ran simulations and come to the smart conclusion to have 3 east coast PVP servers. Yup thats right one for streamers, one for the brazilians and south americans who have to flood into one server to play, and one for you peasantly non-streamer non-south american players to pack into like the sardine-like consumers you are.
---
Dont ask questions, don't get uppity. Trust the 4D chess plan laid out by the company that hasn't driven their main game into the dirt.
---
Trust the Plan. #WWG1WGA
---
Personally, I was considering a second wife. They can keep each other occupied, and the kids.
---
ragnaros and QT both have mostly brazil/SA players. yes im aware its not exclusively brazillian
---
That would be us who broke the things, LOL
---
theres nothing wrong with people playing what they want to play.
---
They also said Panda's would never be in the game..
---
It seemed to work in Vanilla. They opened up transfers from a high pop server to our newer lower pop server and entire guilds moved over.
---
&gt;Layering DECIMATES any sort of permanent community that vanilla had.
---
This is the main reason why I was going to sub for classic, that server community feel I never got because I played in cata/legion.
---
Oh well, I can play something else instead. It's not like I've played any blizzard games since they botched BfA either.
---
KEK
---
Tagging monsters before other players when they respawn, reacting to PvE mechanics, &amp; devilsaur farming and abusing spell batching; both of those have massive impacts.
---
Hmmm.... 
---
Empty capital cities
---
People getting dismounted mid-flight from FPs and falling to their deaths
---
People's own party members disappearing/phasing out right before their eyes, oftentimes in a cave causing the one left alone to pull mobs that weren't alive/there seconds ago and die
---
People unable to participate in the big WPVP events/raids because they weren't able to join the correct layer
---
People phasing for an extra chest/rare/node etc
---
Mobs spawning out of nowhere, or disappearing right as they're about to die
---
I'm probably missing a few items. Need I list more?
---
Waiting for launch to play.
---
I did however play on aclassic server afew months back. Living a huntard was ezpz. Lvling a rogue...not so much
---
You can not manually switch layers other than hoping a relog does the trick. You need to be invited to a group by someone on a separate layer, and even then you might have to wait a few seconds(20+). If you invite someone, they come to your layer. The very few forced relayerings are a bug, that's not intended.
---
This made me lol. Thank you
---
War it is then.
---
&gt; -Blizzard has said layering will last for phase 1 only, there is no reason to believe otherwise
---
/u/blahs44 if this isn't true I want your to eat your shoe. Agreed?
---
I wish people would stop spreading the misconception that the layering behaviour that we saw in the stress test, is how it's gonna be on launch. They tweaked layering to be very aggressive for the stress test, specifically to test it. That's the entire point of playing a *beta* release.
---
If you go to the website and go to account settings you should be able to add a subscription there
---
BR picked Thalnos I believe.
---
There's no way this happens that fast. They want the casual, or at the very least, semi-casual players to all be at 60 before phase 2
---
I don't envy the dude, if people find him entertaining, then by all means go ahead and give him money.
---
And, yes, yay voluntary exchanges, nothing wrong with that. Just plain supply and demand. Which doesn't invalidate the fact that many streamers are spoiled little shits, some people are just (un)luckier than others, c'est la vie - just don't think you're special.
---
They advertised d3 pvp on the box. Blizzard lies.
---
Oh man, That southpark episode hasnt crossed my mind for years.  I love the song at the end...
---
"games as a service" is a bullshit term created to try to fuck over a consumer's ability to own the things they buy. Its a video game. I purchased a PRODUCT with a name and a box and a brand. Even if it was a service, its one burnt steak of a service that i would send back to the kitchen and demand be cooked better (which i'm doing).
---
thank you,
---
It was the more 'precise'' info I manage to find, nothing was related to ''delete char, how long till it can be use'' 
---
Even searching old blue post.
---
Imaging staying in logging queue for all your play session.
---
Ok so through deduction we should be able to figure out whats right.
---
Or even better lets speculate about all that we dont want so its not right
---
My bad, I misunderstood.
---
The same way they managed it in Vanilla, targeted transfers to new lower population servers and queues.
---
If player count drops by half, that's still 30k players on a single server. The amount of players that quit the game would have to be insane for just a single server to drop down into a normal range. Like, 90% of players quitting sort of levels. 
---
They didn't create enough servers, and they can't get rid of layering.
---
I don't really care either way. I'm just looking forward to friend grouping and actually struggling for loot. I want to savor green items again lmao
---
No. 
---
I have played all the beta tests and didnt notice layering even once.
---
probably diminishing returns eventually
---
&gt; not blatantly marked towards men, as many games today still are.
---
While true that the games that I do see marketed tend to be towards towards men(teenagers generally more specifically) most games I don't see really marketed at all outside of their steam store trailers/screenshots. 
---
Using stardew as an example, I only know of it due to word of mouth and it's popularity/appearance on steam sales. I've never seen anything advertised for a game like animal crossing either. 
---
That said, I wonder how it is that they obtain such a loyal niche demographic while the larger gaming populations avoid them entirely. Makes me wonder if it's happenstance or intentional. Just something I never really though about!
---
&gt; product success than even the development team itself.
---
I think you're wrong. Nobody is more motivated than the people _being paid_ to make this happen. If it fails, they lose a whole lot more than any customer will.
---
I have sure missed on a great banger there

---
Well yeah that's the point of layering, to deal with the overpopulation. You can't just have everyone on the same few servers, it's not an option. You either need to have layering, or to make more servers. If you make more servers, then the distribution of players in org compared to the rest of the world would be the same as with layering. The only difference is that the realms will be dead in a few months.
---
Pretty low odds tbh
---
Though that was at the time when they didn't think it was possible and given some significant arguments that happened between player base factions i'd argue its got some truth to it and some arguments we will see after launch
---
Why release a partial report? And it was over the weekend which probably means most people were off like a normal work week.
---
Server names came out so late and streamers/different languages popping up on who knows what servers, friends at work or not on over the weekend to figure out where everyone wants to roll. Going to be rolling the dice trying to put names on the right realm...
---
Probably going with the west coast servers even though I am on east coast so it should be between the 2 pvp servers and Grob for me.

A classic right there

that's COMPLETELY LOGICAL . WHY would you go to the main city at lvl 1-15 on a friggin TEST server, except maybe for 5 minutes to grab the flightpath and visit a trainer.

What is wrong with you people?

&gt; its only there to ensure a smooth launch experience for players

This is a secondary effect. The main reason why they insist on layering is because Blizzard expects to have a lot of players just checking the game out for a week or two then leaving. If they cram 12K players in the same realm, but on different layers, you will still have 3K players on that realm if 75% of the players leave. If they started with 4K people, however, the server would end up with only a thousand players.
---
In the scenario that Blizzard considers keeping Layering after phase 1, that means the player number decline was not as big as they expected; in order to deactivate Layering they would have to deal with a immense number of support requests and complaints because of huge queues and realm transfers.
---
Classic respawn time are faster than Light hope in the startings areas tho.
---
How absolutely dare you, sir!
---
Press F for people named Gaiman
---
&gt;Like if they had made good decisions in retail that improved the game my guess is people wouldn't really want Classic... right?
---
Absolutely not. TBC and WotLK were good expansions and there were people even back then that wanted Vanilla servers.
---
1.)  A layered server can still die.  
---
2.)  If a server is dead, what does it matter if it gets merged?
---
3.)  If you don't see a problem with that kind of intra-server decohesion, I don't know what else to tell you.  Get a clue, I guess.
---
the old original blizzard knew everything, yes. but this new modern blizzard? they have proven themselves to know nothing over the last years
---
Thats like saying white guys are a niche. Its a terrible use of the word
---
No they dont ass kiss
---
There's definitely a bit of a spike outside of the first few zones. It's already been shown that the starting areas themselves have different rules for mob hit/miss% that are a bit more lenient for the player, and the first zone + most of the second zones are pretty easy too. After that is when the mobs start to take a bit more time to kill and maybe have threatening spells.
---
Mage/Hunter are also great levelers but pretty much any class can cruise through the first 20 levels or so.
---
I heard gay fish will be a playable race in 1.13
---
I'm so glad my parents weren't one of those (not saying yours were specifically, just reading and hearing from a lot of others over the years) paranoid stuckups who knew nothing of technology. My dad said he needed an evening to read into it, then pronto made a deal with me to do a bunch of house work each month for my sub. I was so happy i did it with glee, wishing to earn it, and some months he had to make up something for me to do lol.
---
I multiboxed the stress test. I searched for 4 months to find an alliance lock player with my same schedule that could no-life launch for 3 days to level. When I couldn't find anyone, I decided to dual box a pally and lock for the aoe, imp fire shield and health synergies and free mounts. After a while, I decided to test adding a mage. The blizzard aoe, portals, and free food would boost my speed and playtime, plus watching Kargoz and a friend run a mage/lock duo just didn't seem to cut it.
---
After that, I debated added 2 more for 5. I ended up picking a priest instead for the bubble, heals, shadow damage single target boost for the lock and other buffs. I managed to find a friend who will play a hunter at launch for the instant mob tagging. Ultimately, I wanted to mage the best aoe/dungeon group I could, but no one else I know would match my schedule.
---
Playing 2+ of the same class is easy. I can faceroll with 4 warriors and a pally. 5 hunters/shaman/mages/locks would be cancer to run into anywhere in the world.
---
Controlling 4 different classes is hard as hell though. There are a ton of macros and keybindings to design that make your characters work efficiently together. I have to set up visual windows of my other games within my main game window that allow me to click the ground just to cast blizzard or rain of fire since you can't cast those @target.
---
I'd most likely be an easy kill in world pvp.  Unless I can fear one target and sheep another at the same time, then nuke the last enemy, 2-3 people would annoy the hell out of me. I look forward too it though.
---
&gt;friendship with pot ended
---
&gt;now WarCrack is my best friend!
---
In fact anyone crying is kind of dumb. It made the game playable which it wouldnt be without it.
---
I feel like the "blizzard knows what they're doing, wait until it's released" has burned a lot of people in the past
---
I was told by numerous others that they are in CA and IL. I live in MSP and got 20ms on Stalagg and 60ms on the other two.
---
Well you could say that eggplants are purple and purple=EPIC!!!
---
In all honesty I woul rather dps as a warrior but I find it easier to get loot and be an important piece of the guild when I play as prot.
---
Lmao, seriously... 
---
It seems like every time there is a public outcry in any Blizzard game a whiteknight needs to come along horseback and defend the naysayers with his shield of justice.
---
All this post really does is act as a fire extinguisher and is trying to silence the masses about underlying problems that we're iterating to not have in live.
---
&gt;-Blizzard has said layering will last for phase 1 only, **there is no reason to believe otherwise**
---
Other than the countless amount of times where they've promised something to their players in the past (especially retail wow) and then went back on their word?
---
Saturation is not a generalized term when referring to graphics/monitors. It specifically refers to brightness/harshness of light in this category, hence the downvotes.
---
do you need them to arrive frozen? I think it will cost more for that.
---
Guilds typically form around the tank.  No serious raid guild is going to put together a group without a designated tank already set. That being said you will meet so many people on your way to 60 and some of them may be just starting a guild or in a new guild looking for a tank. You'll definitely get a spot but try to look for a tank spot before you hit lvl 60.
---
It's pretty common for Blizzard to give 1 day of free gametime if you ask for one and say you're going to put some gold together or get a wow token from a friend.
---
I don't know about you, but I try to respond to the WHOLE point, not dissect the point into saying what I want it to say, then make a reply based on that.
---
See but now everyone will be waiting a few months. Me, Im planning on waiting at LEAST a year. Nobody is stealing my name during character customization.
---
"But now since streamers are allowed to play the game"   Wut?
---
I can guarantee that if you post on the recruitment forums that you're a warrior tank LF Guild, you'll have at least five replies before name reservation goes live.
---
Call a spade a spade instead of making false analogies. It IS the game MOST people wanted. Layering doesnt ruin it for them, and most likely improves the experience. You get everything mechanical that was in vanilla wow.
---
Its not going to be temporary. Because when classic flops, the people who'd fight for Sharding's removal will all have left. So the ONLY people that blizzard will hear any criticism from are people who like Sharding, so they'll keep it in because they think the community likes Sharding.
---
haha blizzard made Cata, WoD and BFA. They do not know more than me.
---
Im just trying to extract some fun from this sub :P
---
Why were those adverts claiming 15 million? Must of been tbc - my bad
---
Please go  play pokomon go with your friend.   You are to stupid for wow...   'capital city was a ghost town.....  moron'
---
But my char is female
---
Huh, I didn't realize that came out in TBC. TIL
---
Sadly I ended up having to take the 20-26th off as my daycare provider is closed those days for their own vacation. If only they could have taken it a week later it would have lined up perfectly.
---
Ah well.
---
Best post in a long time here.
---
No one take his fish sticks.  This buffoon has been keeping them in the fridge.
---
I do : )
---
I don’t really think so. Some people are disturbingly good at large-scale wpvp. Just by nature of voice chat having less delay than a twitch stream, if good players are hunting packs of streamers/viewers, they will be able to dumpster huge numbers of them. It’s not actually about individual skill as much as just using sappers at the correct time.
---
Just throw some ice in the Fedex pak.
---
so? it shouldn't be there at all!
---
They can start with it working as originally described, instead of phasing on steroids
---
Honestly actual server merges would be fine. They’ve refused to do that and instead do the whole battlegroup thing with the whole world/dungeon finder.
---
There was some special "it factor" about me and my best friend rolling up to kobolds and bonking them over the head together. Hoping that feeling keeps up to 60 on launch
---
people taking blizzards side in this argument are wrong
---
It's not just quitting, it's about playing schedule. Blizzard doesn't really care so much about the realm population, they care about the concurrent online population. With the hype of the launch people are going to be online a lot before falling into a more regular schedule that will lower the online population at any given time. That's virtually guaranteed to happen, even without anyone quitting permanently.
---
I've always tried to get my name and never succeeded maybe this will be the time
---
Ohh thank God. I thought I was the only reasonable one left on this sub.
---
All game subs have a vocal minority of whiners, here we have it before the game even released. He'll we had it since before it was announced
---
My old work laptop, a Dell Latitude with integrated graphics, runs retail buttery smooth on medium settings. Should run classic maxed out.
---
well it's not blizzlike since we didn't really have streamers in OG classic so that's def a mark in the "changes" category. 
---
happy cake thing btw.

**Wiping with Friends \[H\] | EU-PvP | Wed &amp; Sun | 20.00-23.00 CET | Semi-hardcore | Loot Council**
---
**Introduction**  
---
&lt;Wiping with Friends&gt; is a two-times-a-week raiding guild with a strong core of raiding veterans with experience from vanilla to BFA looking for like-minded raiders to fill the remainder of our roster.
---
Our officer team has years of experience leading guilds both on retail and on private servers to server first kills, rank 1 dps-parses and everything in between. We recognize the difficulty of leading 40 raiders to victory in an efficient manner, thus we diligently make use of infographics and other tools to become one of the top raiding guilds in our bracket.
---
Our ambitions remain high, and we aim to clear all content Classic WoW has to offer on a tight schedule while still maintaining a friendly and fun raid environment. If you love the glory days of WoW raiding and have a competitive mindset – but don’t want to sacrifice real life to find raiding success – consider joining &lt;Wiping with Friends&gt;. 
---
**Member expectations**  
---
We are looking for players who:  
---
\-    Can maintain 90% raid attendance  
---
\-    Will show up prepared every Wednesday and Sunday night with the needed buffs and consumables\*  
---
\-    Can stay dedicated to the improvement of a single character  
---
\-    Are mature both in age (18+) and mentality.
---
\* Required world buffs and consumables vary between raids.
---
**Raid schedule**  
---
We raid Wednesday and Sunday nights with first pull starting at 20.00 and raid ending at 23.00. This is a strict schedule and we will never add extra mandatory raiding days, nor will we ever ask our members to stay after 23.00 – therefore it is very important that all members show up prepared.
---
**Applications and contact information**  
---
To apply we ask you to fill out a short questionnaire at [https://forms.gle/rWAsEWAKg82RDrHT9](https://forms.gle/rWAsEWAKg82RDrHT9)
---
For any questions contact **Jemzy#4449** or **Bloo#2047** on discord.
---
We are almost at full capacity, but we are currently in need of **mages**, **warriors** and **rogues** though applications from talented players of all classes will be considered.
---
You would rather have queues that last for hours every night you want to play for potentially weeks?
---
Good stuff, great choice of soundtrack :D
---
It was never hard to kill mobs. Especially for hunters and warlocks. It was just time consuming and in some locations with some mobs it was a little risky if you were alone. The biggest challenge for the first week will be finding live mobs.
---
I thought after the honor patch people might engage in wpvp, but I guess not. Oh well! I’m glad to hear I’m not the only person struggling with realm choice.
---
Most people don't give that much of a shit, it's 1000x better than anything close to resembling vanilla. Im sure us very few dozen remaining fanbois will find a way to enjoy this game. Have fun doing anything else, our "devoid" guild will have to manage with all the other soulless guilds
---
I’ve seen absolutely no post that gives a hard number of what the caps will be. I think one post used a number, but only as an example. Definitely no “x is the cap” stuff.
---
lmao this shit gay af bruh
---
I'm deciding for myself, unlike you.
---
It's in the OP because *that* is a reference. There was some other post on here about a guy saying he's making a shaman named Thex. Then everyone in the world said they're going to do that too/first. Then people kept saying it. And here we are.
---
This is how Asmongold will look in 5 years.
---
Exactly this.
---
Yea, that seems to be the trend
---
Sans offense évidemment mais tu as l'air vachement susceptible, respire un coup.
---
Thanks for another great example of my point.
---
"Please refrain" sounds like advice indeed.
---
Then why are you bothering to play?
---
Yeah that'a why BFA is doing so well, because Blizzard knows best, another AstroTurf shill post.
---
My game time ended aug 8th. I am not planning to resub until aug 27th. Both stress test and  name are both horrible indicators
---
It used to be Racism and Bush, with Chuck Norris Jokes.
---
Phase 1 is 6 months long, they said they would keep in layering for the first couple of weeks after launch.
---
Honestly? too bad. They are already doing layering because it's the best they could come up with.
---
It just so happens it's a less better solution than the fantasies of armchair developers
---
Good, a target rich environment!  Take care!
---
Don't care will still shit on you ingame. Go on be mad.
---
You probably won't suffer any consequences beyond the creeping and ever-increasing shame of slowly reazing how fucking dumb and unfunny these names are.
---
Thought so too, resubed anyway to run about with a friend for the stress test only to find out my name was taken o.O
---
I'm rolling UD rogue on Herod, will be PvPing at max level and would love a partner to do stealth runs with! I found a guild on this subreddit that seems very chill, if you wanna chat some more hit me up on here [https://discord.gg/ZSw9SDC](https://discord.gg/ZSw9SDC)
---
No one is ever going to get banned for simply speaking in another language, unless they are being offensive or trolling in said language.  Report them as much as you want.
---
It's honestly amusing you would go to such lengths to gatekeep entire cultures that were not given their own servers.
---
Very true. This is such a unique situation it's fun to try and figure out the numbers.  
---
First we would need to know the cost of development/upkeep to see where the break even point is on #subs+time subbed.  
---
Word of mouth is powerful advertising. Highly satisfied customer will bring others to your product. However, this is a very niche product. How many people will that customer bring in?  This product has a timeline.  At what point will new players no longer join for being too late?
---
Many of the new subs will be returning players who are dissatisfied with the current product.  Do these players own other Blizzard games?  Will highly satisfied customer buy other Blizzard games? Will they be more likely to purchase new upcoming games?
---
The subs are shared with another product.  How many players will be taken away from the other product?  Is the other product more or less profitable?  
---
Finally we have the lifecycle of Classic.  What will happen to all these subs after Classic ends?  Does Blizzard have plans for Classic+?  Will they go the pserver route and roll new fresh servers?
---
All of these things factors into how much time and money Blizzard will put into Classic.  $13 is $13 but a highly satisfied customer base has it's advantages.
---
The XP in this version of the game doesn't scale. So not much. Maybe a few bars. I would recommend questing to 40-45 then dungeon grinding to 60.
---
Agreed
---
I know I don't know more than Blizz, but I also know that Blizz is delusional if they think they have an accurate enough idea of how attrition will work to get the number of layers per server right.
---
3 second cast time during which you can't move (unlike with grenades) and the stun breaks on damage
---
The item is complete garbage and no one uses it, sappers are objectively the correct thing to use in large scale pvp
---
They obviously have data supporting not enough Latin American players to support a single server. The language locked EU realms everyone pushed for are already looking a little iffy as to whether they can support a decent population.
---
It won't effect the auction house itself as it will be server wide however it will effect the economy due to being able to exploit the layering for farming of rares as has already been shown in countless videos.
---
Vanilla had the allure of nobody knew what was next
---
... classic we have every second of every patch dug through 100000 times over.
---
Classic will be fun for those who stick around - the MAJORITY will stop playing rather quickly. 
---
It's 2019, other forms of entertainment exist, 2019 games exist, the population won't be nearly as big as most people think.
---
A small % of players will even hit 60 in 2019.
---
Do you work at blizzard? Nobody has said how long phases are yet. And layering has been said to likely remain through phase one.
---
You’re not coming at this guy without him knowing 9/10 times that he will flag for pvp. He will do it when he knows he can get that first hit off before you because it means doing 5x the dmg that would most likely leave you low enough to run.
---
I took the week after launch off in case the first week is... Diablo 3
---
Give it time. There will be dozens and dozens that leave guilds because warriors are a bit of an added challenge to level if you aren't paying attention. 
---
Tanks and healers will always be needed by some raid group or guild.
---
Dude, I want some of what you are smoking...
---
It’ll take casual players 3-4 months to hit 60. It’d be moronic for Blizzard to push phase 2 before 80-90% of their population is 60.
---
No, the hyperbole of a dead server meaning it just feels dead to you only came about in the privates to the community. Where people kept server hopping trying to find the fun in fresh launches.
---
Talked it over with the people I'm primarily playing with and we chose Grob, so I guess Grobby Gang it is for me!! Good luck with your choice! o/
---
Yeah you couldn’t be more wrong. Apart from the 1%, normal average joe players do not use a multi monitor. You’re just misguided by your environment.
---
How? Do you know how many asmongolds are going to be on each server? How many variations of it? How will you really know?
---
Bro, you just posted CRINGE
---
007 is  GNOME WARLOCK so this must be a good system.
---
Hurr Durr a specific someone camping a specific someone for a week straight Everytime they log in is just pvp in a pvp realm hurr durrr
---
So don't play for a few months if it's something you don't enjoy.
---
You mean let's just ignore everything they've ever done in the passed that would lend evidence to refute this? Ok lmao sure why not
---
&gt; -Blizzard smartly released a conservative number of servers with more ready to go if need be. This is because it is way easier to add servers than to take them away and transfer people off dead realms.
---
How on Earth is it easier to add more servers than it is to merge them? Mind explaining how that works? Thanks.
---
&gt; -The stress test is NOT an example of how the game will perform on live, that goes for layering and other features
---
Source for this claim? Seems to be based on your own speculation and conjecture at best. 
---
&gt; -For the people complaining about the number of servers.. again, you have no idea what you are talking about. a) You don't have Blizzards stats showing subs, stress test and beta data, public interest polling and the rest b) you don't know what their servers are capable off in terms of input load 
---
Ok, so you must have this information then? Mind sharing it with us? We know that they are going to try and reproduce the feel of vanilla wow as best they can, which would mean server caps of about 3k people.
---
You can work hard to do an easy thing better, not to mention time is more relevant when you have 40 people on at the same time vs solo.
---
Spaniard here. We get everything dubbed to Spanish, and public education is pretty bad in terms of teaching foreign languages. I'm 27 though, so take that with a pinch of salt.
---
Nowadays with social media young people gets a 500% more exposed to English, compared to people from my generation, but those are the ones probably playing wow classic, so... Yeah.
---
I had checked it prior to posting. But the one realm that is somewhat balanced only has 100 or so responses. I assume with more response it would be even heavier on the alliance side.
---
Fair point about entitlement.  I first became aware of the "big name" wow streamers by coming across 2 hour long youtube circlejerk sessions that with them grieving over the loss of community throughout the years in "retail" and how classic will hopefully revive that sense of community again.  Of course they don't owe the classic community anything - but they should do it this favor of allowing us to not be a part of their shenanigans if we don't want to be.  It is all about the community after all, right?  
---
As for Blizzard though, they owe me consistency in the application of their terms of service as long as I am a paid subscriber.  Should they chose to deny me service and no longer take my money, they don't owe me anything after that.  Don't bother telling me about how a streamer with thousands of followers is more valuable than I am, and that they'd rather loose hundreds of me instead of one of them - again I get it.  
---
All we are asking for is this one courtesy, because their play style and presence threatens my play style and my presence.  If they don't extend the common decency of allowing us to avoid them if we want to - then my play style will threaten their presence as much as possible.
---
If you think there aren't already a band of poorly manicured incels filled with rage. Ready to hunt them across space and, time. You would be wrong. The only thing incels hate more then some one who is popular. Is a woman. I would appreciate them if they announced though.
---
Soooo... problem solved?
---
Only been 7 mins, dont worry it will
---
Since you know the future, go play the lottery and then purchase enough stock in Blizzard to become a director and have your way. For now keep quiet
---
&gt;Phase 1 is 6 months long,
---
Gonna need some sauce on that because Blizzard has never publicly stated how long phases are, and any timeline put together by anyone else is pure speculation/bullshit/scare tactics.
---
I agree
---
I agree..... on these names :-p
---
The trick was to get behind the pillar/ staircase around the corner to initiate a duel. Then to poly infront of the door.  They may have patched that spot, but I'll check.
---
Not sure you know what that word means but nice try fella
---
You are a gentleman and a scholar.
---
Yeah lol, I know apex is suspicious. You can still say "we can't be sure" but yeah, I know what their intention was.
---
It is a good cause though, does it matter if they did it for money if it's helping the world? It's an incentive to do good. I don't mind it. As I argued earlier, if curing cancer makes you money, I don't really care.
---
Come on man, you're really going to say appealing to one sexuality is bad, but the other sexuality isn't because it's culturally accepted? 
---
Slavery was the norm in the US too, is it bad abraham lincoln appealed to people against it to win the war? (My history is scuffed, if this is wrong, consider it a hypothetical.)
---
I suppose you're right.
---
 Do you think  it's okay for well fleshed out characters to be binary? Say geralt from the witcher 3 being gay.
---
It's only the needlessly mentioned sexualities you care about right? straight, gay or whatever.
---
When ZG comes out you can make bank farming crocodiles for bijous. In DM you can do lashers, tribute with engineering, and I think DM E skip runs with enchanting but I don't remember. In phase one there are dogs in LBRS in the gulleys there that are easy to aoe farm. I'm pretty sure mages can do mara princess runs. I'm def leaving some out though lol.
---
August 2004 public stress test. Game launched with the same patch as the stress test, game version 1.1.0 Patched to 1.1.1 10 days later on november 17th
---
A better argument to "raids being easy" in Classic, in my opinion, is that your character is also simple.
---
Raid bosses are dailed down, but so are characters. 
---
A good example is how crazy mobility is in BFA. Monks can literally roll / speed bonus a distance farther than I ever thought WoW would allow. It soaks the fun out. People need time, energy, and reflection for a game to be good.
---
That is the company people are telling me to put faith in; to trust that they know more about the game I want, than I do.
---
And the sheer number of players on each server.
---
Sulfuron c'est tout ce que je pouvais demander
---
Hate to nitpick but isn't Onyxia's lair in Dustwallow Marsh not Swamp of Sorrows?
---
That’s alliance talk. We don’t allow that
---
The irony of this post is THICK.
---
"Me not that kind of orc."
---
good days becoming back..
---
/r/woosh
---
When I played the game the first time around, I put into motion a plan to have no actual responsibilities ever, you know... just in case they rereleased it st some point.  Looks like I get the last laugh now =p
---
What?  Shadowguard is amazing.
---
Oh I actually intend to RP.  I was actually trying to come up with a name that sounds deathknight-like when I first came up with it (back in BC) and only realized after the fact that it sounded like something from an SNL skit.
---
So they should alter the way they do things because others want them to? They are paying customers. They pay the same sub that you do. They literally owe you nothing.
---
No, private servers had wrong values.
---
Rarely had that problem in vanilla... now we're 15 years later. This doesnt seem at all a concern to me. And its fun tbh you learn a bunch of curse words.
---
no, not really. ending up with dead servers that you need to either merge together or offer free transfers off of isn't an ideal scenario in the slightest
---
Umm, how many random group mates did you remember? You remembered those who were bad, you friended those who were good, and everyone else just registered as “competent”. Very few individuals had a significant well know reputation. 
---
Most of your reputation was tied to your guild. Your reputation affected your guilds reputation which then impacted your guild mates reputation so even if you were remembered you didn’t do anything because people would report you to your guild. 
---
I see the value in seeing people in the world, that is why I am all for layering creating the opportunity to meet a more diverse group of people without losing out on the ability to play/enjoy the game.
---
Not really. One player meets another player in the open world. The difference is, one player controls 5 characters, the other only controls one. I'd call that an unfair advantage.
---
The whole point of classic wow being rereleased is because Blizzard DIDN'T know best you stupid ape.
---
Not when all the streamer's followers are spamming General chat with "INVITE TO ____'S LAYER" and causing general mayhem in whatever layer they're currently in.
---
&gt;You get everything mechanical that was in vanilla wow.
---
And extra shit that wasn't, like Sharding. Are you seeing the problem yet? Sharding wasn't in Vanilla WoW. That's the problem. If you give me Vanilla WoW with Sharding you are not giving me Vanilla WoW. Likewise, if you give me a Ham and Swiss on Rye but with Tunafish instead, its not a Ham and Swiss on Rye, is it? And I'm 100% allowed to be mad that you didn't bring me the exact sandwich I ordered.
---
I thought there was a cooldown after deleting a char before the name was released?
---
I come here once every month ans each time all i see is whining. Dont be such a puss
---
But indicators all the same.
---
Sadly, there is no indicator as helpful to Blizzard as actual launch. So either somebody trusts Blizzard or they don't.
---
No one knows for sure, many of them aren't announcing it.
---
Saw this a lot, played with all of the graphics settings but didnt seem to find a way to make it stop.
---
I think they are targeting more like 6k concurrent or 20k active pop per server at stability. 100k active NA pvpers.
---
Or it would be playable, but they’d have had so many realms made that once people quit, we’d have a boatload of dead realms. Which would make it barely playable.
---
Its sadly at very poor stage right now. No improvements since last stress test
---
they are scared of getting mass-ganked infront of raids and such
---
Sounds about right to me.
---
If you're gonna be playing your little game, you're gonna go raid with Grandpa! No if's and's or but's about it!
---
have a question, I have a new account, and I ran the game, but it requires another account name and pw, what is my account name? do i create an account somewhere, why do i have to log in twice? thank you
---
Secrets.  SECRETS!!!
---
Yeah...uh...there’s def a bunch of skills you will want. 
---
Vanish and blind alone make some quests solvable that are usually not.
---
Im just fooling.
---
Its quite funny all the BR hate. Even we hate ourselves
---
It is a compromise to temporarily solve launch problems.  Being grumpy about layering is understandable.  
---
&gt;  the no-faith crowd has reason to be grumpy when every development seems to be bad news.
---
It seems to be bad news, at least in the context of this discussion, based off how something is working in beta/stress test, which (again IMO) isn't really a good premise for the doomsday narrative.
---
I used to run a channel for friends that were across guilds but I can't remember how I moderated it.
---
Wouldn't this just be considered RMT by Blizzard though.
---
Good lord, this joke is beaten to a pulp and it's only been a week.
---
They said there wouldn't be a layering system, and then they added one. So as far as OP's "there is no reason to believe otherwise" there's actually dozens of reasons why we SHOULD believe otherwise.
---
The biggest reason of all being, look at current retail.
---

---
But how do we get invited to asmongold layer?
---
How long will this be up? Until release?
---
Huh. I stand corrected *shrugs*
---
During my WoW play time I was with 3 guilds. The casual guild I was a part of while I leveled to Max. The guild that I geared with so I can push end game content. And the guild I finally joined that allowed me to complete end game content, new and old. 
---
I met a lot of players while leveling up, some that ended up being my arena partners in the future, some that I hung with that were my own age, (guild mates weren't), some I never interacted with again but would see. And that doesn't even begin to describe the amount of people I met in server pugs and slowly got to know over time.
---
Most people I met were or became close with were through the coincidence of running into them multiple times.
---
If you've played online games you'd know most people do not instantly connect. It's not about meeting a lot of people, it's about forging a connection however small by seeing and meeting the same people. I still remember when I was leveling up, paying the best tank in game gold on our server to carry me through stuff. And when I was finally on his level, I thought it was cool to be his OT even if he didn't remember me. I knew who he was because I saw him in chat talking everyday. General chat is not shared between layers. That specific experience won't be recreated.
---
No one is saying they won't see people, they're saying they won't see the same people. And seeing the same people is what's important to a community more than anything else.
---
yeah.. you learn to speak english in school very early on. i don't see this being a problem, other than people being assholes of course.

Jesus fucking Christ get a grip

They intend to turn layering off.

Because you are implying that there is any other way to do this/that vanilla wasn't like this.

Yeah it isn't ideal, but if you have a better idea, lmk because this is the best we will get.

Meanwhile I'm over here just trying to get my voidwalker quest in undercity but I can't because....there was no NPCs in uc on my layer.
---
What a strange case. I don't think anyone I knew was able to download the client before-hand either, who wasn't invited to a test.
---
IDK how unique your case is or isn't. I guess I can hope that nothing goes wrong and I'm able to DL the client at the appropriate time ;p.

How did you sign for a subscription without creating a blizzard account?

It’s been awhile for me; but the last time I played I had to login into my battle net account to turn on my subscriptions, download games etc.

That’s your login.

Exactly this.  People can also avoid Thalnos and Faerlina.  That's where most Spanish and Portuguese speakers are rolling.
---
Yup. Just can't log in.

No, the credits also include everyone working on BFA.

How the #$@! could you buy a subscription without logging in?  Bliz would have to know which account gets the monthly playtime.

---
Should be the same as the one you already created? Otherwise sorry I don't know. Contact Blizzard Support.
---
That's what layering is supposed to be (if it works correctly) - basically multiple servers (layers) that share the same name and are auto-merged together after a period of time, without the hassle of making people transfer characters manually later.
---
Is that even confirmed? I had to manually group up with all of my friends on the stress test.
---
Companies need to make a quality product to get my business, the horror!
---
&gt; How is launching more servers after a period of time, a good idea? We either need to level again or pay for transfer en masse?
---
In WoW's history, server transfers to solve overpopulation issues have been free. Blizzard would either open a new server or target an existing low population server and offer free transfers there from an existing overpopulated server.
---
&gt;No one has yet explained how mass layers (I'm assuming 10 x 3k player layers on one pvp server) isn't going to affect economy and pricing. Surely there will be 10 times the rare node spawns and we need to hope the demand from more players evens it out.
---
It's not just hoping it'll even out. Something extremely weird would need to be going on for the number of people farming the supply to not scale directly with the number of people buying the materials when the overall population is higher.
---
&gt;I think the community is largely ignorant to the specific technical and business details but not necessarily the design. The design is what the player base has been engaging with all of these years and a lot of people are able to understand why a specific design created a specific experience. For example it did not take long to explain that 4 content phases would not suit classic. People get that a lack of flying ( in comparison) makes the world feel bigger. The reason there is a hype for this game to return is because people intuitively appreciate the design.
---
To an extent, but a ton of the criticism towards layering has come from either the attitude that Blizzard wouldn't be fixing anything that wasn't working right or from a lack of knowledge of actions Blizzard has already taken. All these complaints about layer hopping to farm rare mobs and materials? They stopped being relevant back in July when Blizzard added a cooldown to switching layers. Doing anything that would give xp, looting or harvesting anything, being involved in pvp, or switching layers puts an invisible debuff on you that stops you from switching layers for a certain amount of time. It's no longer possible to just hop from layer to layer to layer looking for a particular rare or to see if a resource node is up.

So, you play in german realm?

Not worth your time.

I don’t hate Brazilians I just don’t want to play on a server with people who can’t/don’t want to speak English. I’ve had bad experiences with getting grouped with Brazilians in dungeon finder.
---
One of my friends said he wanted to get "Milkme" on a Tauren.
---
I don't think he understands how RP realms work.
---
I subbed last week lmfao not even sure why. Just wanted to look at my old vanilla gear I have saved in the bank one last time. Jumed out test server for a bit but then said fuck it we close now just going to wait for release. So yea.... not my best $15 spent but I can afford it so whatever.

By giving blizzard your money you are supporting layering.

I can only speak for myself, but as a dane (on a server filled with other danes) my two favorite nations are definitely the British and Finish people.

Putting every damn ability on the GCD is in the "best interest of the game".

Azerite gear is also fun.

Good chance that's on the restricted name filter.  Like most every other copyrighted name.

&gt; Mass murders, stochastic terrorism, white supremacy, and racial and politically (86% alt-right) motivated killings are soaring.

The vast bulk of mass shooters are from the far left, who grew up in single-family homes and are on SSRIs. Being conservative has nothing to do with mass shootings.

&gt; At any time you can choose to not be affiliated, so look inward for the solution.

I don't do guilt by association. I have my believes, political and otherwise, and I stand by them because I think they are correct.

99% chance that most streamers will be 2x your level and you won't be able to gank them until like 2 months when you hit 60, and then yo u will need a numbers advantage because they are way more geared than you are

Jesus christ this sub. It's not 2004 anymore and it  won't feel like it. The chat is going to be full of twitch emotes and spergs. I don't like streamers but im not gonna go out my way to gank them because im not a 600lb neckbeard. I've got better things to do than camp streamers like a loaner.

100g? impressive. how?

Wait for launch to complain. Because that always works out so well.

How can people type that phrase seriously?

Awesome.

If it's some Boomer shit to want to spend my money on something I enjoy then hand me the six pack of monster energy.

It’s extremely easy to match up where they are in game with what server they are on, unless they pay people to mirror their location and actions on other servers, they will have a swarm of clip chimps on top of them almost instantly
---
I thought shadowmeld did break on cast? Have you tried this on beta/stress test?
---
Never had an issue either. Tons of people everywhere I went. I never went to a capital city because why would you on a 1-15 server?
---
Go ask them and you’ll see how wrong you are.
---
That's impossible... You would have to have separate gate openings on each layer then...

Multiple gate openings per server can't happen

Whoops my bad I didn't realize troll priest had a specific passive. 
---
Undead: 
---
Touch of Weakness: The next melee attack against the caster will cause 8 Shadow damage and reduce the damage caused by the attacker by 2 for 2 min.
---
Devouring Plague: Afflicts the target with a disease that causes 152 Shadow damage over 24 seconds. Damage caused by the Devouring Plague heals the caster. (Good for PVP.)
---
Troll: 
---
Hex of Weakness: Weakens the target enemy, reducing damage caused by 2 and reduces effectiveness of healing spells by 20% for 2 minutes. (Good for PVP.)
---
- Shadowguard: The caster is surrounded by shadows. When a spell, melee or ranged attack hits the caster, the attacker will be struck for 20 Shadow damage. Attackers can only be damaged once every few seconds. This damage causes no threat. 3 charges. Lasts 10 min. (Good for PVP.)
---
Personally I like troll priests better and the racial seems better.
---
that's me! gonna play on a english server because i just can't stand my own fucking language and people, despite being some of them really good players actually, just too much elitism sometimes.
---
look i'm not exactly in love with it either but it is the least permanently disruptive solution to a temporary problem
---
you may not have a problem waiting in long queues but i would be willing to bet that you're in the minority on that. this isn't 2004 anymore, people have shit they gotta do and if their limited leisure time starts to involve waiting in a virtual line for a half hour or whatever they'll find something else to do with it
---
Its gonna be like this forever, its the spell batching thingy. They just added lagg to everything basicly. If you have on autoloot you can just rightclick and run right away and it will land in ur bags after a small delay :-)
---
You’re mistaken. Does not affect instant attacks at all.
---
Shame they couldn't just roll together.
---
There is no US or NA zone, it's called umricas (with an 's' at the end for the obvious)
---
They honestly just need to remove it by the time this stuff happens.
---
I mean, if your honestly gonna tell me that you know more than blizzard in terms of subs/player statistics, I’d be very interested in seeing the data and analytics you have collected.
---
It's worth it not to hear people pronouncing my name incorrectly for the next few years.
---
I've found a name that people seem to be able to pronounce, regardless of nationality and is distinct when called out on voice chat.
---
That's the thing. I reject both.
---
Every time someone says "blizzard knows what they are doing" blizzard comes out and proves them completely wrong. They still have not fixed herb nodes from phasing out that's been going on since they added it to the game. Blizzard's track record on being right or doing right is far from in their favor.
---
The guide nobody wanted, needed, or asked for

They think they do but they really don't

Alright Gimli. Settle down. Soon you can reserve your character, set up your Stonewrought UI, eat ripe meat off the bone and drink malt beer in IF.

Great post.

A few major cons of layering that you missed (not trying to be critical, trying to help):
---
- Immersion breaking in many ways.
---
- Possible reduced repeating interaction with individual players.
---
Is that today?
---
if it takes 1 week for queues to disappear wouldn't the need for layering last about that long, too? only difference in the end is that i actually got to play the videogame
---
Where do I sign up?

Any who resubs to reserve your name, dont try out retail. Dont let Activision's marketing agency win....

its a decent arpg now, but the itemization and the seasons are laughably stale and boring. I cant be assed to go back and play it when there's grim dawn, poe, and the new warhammer expac

---
Not really, blizzard has been very quiet.
---
so we are compromising the best part of the game where people actually socialize and form communities?
---
Blizzard seems to be hyper-averse to server merges and would argue they've never done it before. Connected, sure, but completely merged, including the name drama? Never. And they probably assume Classic players would react even more poorly to the consequences of Connecting (the realm addendum, misleading census statistics) than retail did.

Nice! I see myself :)

Thank you! Today I downloaded the addon and it worked perfectly during the last hours of the stress-test.

Just happy that its of use!

I haven't touched alcohol at all in 2019, I quit Adderall around 6 months ago, and my goal for the rest of the year is to completely stop drinking caffeine before the calendar turns 2020.

Definitely not doing those things *because* of Classic... but you're not alone :)
---
Do we log in through the normal WoW client, or the separate Classic Client?
---
&gt; I'll keep track.
---
You'll put a tally down when you're layered while crossing into the barrens and don't notice it?
---
"Bad" layering isn't the the problem, it's the concept itself. The community is non existent when you can only see a tenth of the players at any given time, and you're randomly moved into different layers without notice. The players you've been fighting mobs alongside for 30 minutes will just disappear as you walk back to the quest givers.
---
If you don't care, thats fine. But don't pretend it won't happen.
---
I just read the naming policy and it says “Mixed capitals and spaces are not supported”. Does that mean I can’t name my character J***** and instead have to name it j***** ?

My husband isn't a big gamer anymore either, but I have one brother who is, and we were playing and chatting the other night and it was super awesome. He took off the same days from work as me so it'll be grind time come Aug 26th!

I hear lots of complaining about layering and I haven't experienced anything negative.  Can I get some links to see what happened that is so bad?  not just hearsay I want to see the carnage with my eyeballs
---
nochanges
---
The thing that blows my mind is the number of "Blizzard wants this game to fail" comments in other threads.  There are people who genuinely believe stuff like layering is some kind of secret conspiracy to force players not to play Classic.
---
Let's see.  They announced at Blizzcon and have spent 2 years development time and millions of dollars in a game that they hope no one will play.  You have to be genuinely mad or retarded to believe such utter horseshit and yet it's actually being paraded around in numerous discussions and upvoted.  Some people need to get off sites like reddit, and get out from behind their screens for a few hours because it's distorted their ability to perceive reality.
---
Nothing about this post makes sense
---
Weird then. Even MMO Champ has a guide on how to install it and it's the exact same thing. Is your bnet client up to date?
---
Kill it please
---
How do you figure?
---
Layering is mainly to save money on server processing power.
---
It's just a flesh wound!
---
Yes for sure. Totally forgot about Hillsbrad in my comment in this thread. Hillsbrad can be brutal.
---
People ask about this stuff all the time.  But you're an pro-layering, I've seen your comments, it doesn't surprise me you'd oppose honest, unbiased information being posted about Layering.
---
&gt;  Was in a party almost the entire time and got layered 0 times. 
---
Do you genuinely not understand how layering works? You aren't going to notice you've been placed into another layer if you don't actively watch the players around you zone out. If I'm running down the road to org, I won't see the players at it's gates zone out.
---
Due to the servers being named ahead of time plus the nature of the internet, it's only natural that some servers will become claimed by a certain demographic. 
---
Some servers already have certain languages grouping up on them.
---
Sounds like you fill that role bb
---
There is no grace period, I tested during the stress test.  
---
If it concerns you that you will lose your name while you customize your character, then just cooperate with someone.  Have them tag your name as soon as you delete your character, customize away and they can delete the character whenever you’re ready to create your character.
---
Theres no telling when the servers will be live.  They'll be down from overpopulation for quite awhile
---
Oh 100%. 
---
He wants "Meat" and "Beef" which - while somewhat punny - he has reasons for naming in an RP aspect. We suggested he was once a butcher, and got the name "Meat / Beef" so he'll probably enjoy those if he gets them.
---
There is absolutely no reason for them to rush phases like you are saying when they have nothing planned after phase 6. This isn't like the LOTRO legendary servers where they move on to the next ex-pac, we don't know what or if anything is coming after Naxx
---
&gt;In Cataclysm there is a darkshore questline where the Night Elves wipe this village off the map **for attacking them**.
---
Literally genocide.
---
they cant organize as easily but the culture will be vastly different.
---
Is this the normal launcher or do I need to download a separate Classic version? I just bought a sub (no expansion) yesterday after a long break and downloaded the version it came with.
---
When you log into Battlenet, go to wow, then classic.  There is instructions for returning players.
---
It’s literally not even my channel, so no I’m not going to steal credit from the person who made the video.
---
"Our plan", "few weeks"
---
And here's another Blizzard employee from that same event referring to layering as being in the first [few months](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779).
---
You seem like the kind of person who might be interested in buying one of my finest multi-layered bridges. It'll be done in a few weeks. Promise!
---
Good thing you can invite people on different layers to group eh?
---
Thalnos
---
The plan my girlfriend and I came up with was this:
---
each save the others names they want, and then in a few days customize our character and type the name in, once we are ready we will have the other person delete the placeholder character that is saving the name and instantly save the character name with the proper customization
---
will be waiting to subscribe until the weekend before launch for me and my friends.
---
Lol believe it or not I do work a job I love. I'm not jealous of asmongold in the slightest. I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
For a short period of time, absolutely. I had no issues linking up with guildmates and friends in the stress test. I'll take a handful of very minor inconveniences over massive queue times and flooded zones where I get one mob every couple of minutes. The fact that so many of you can't grasp this temporary setback for the overall health of the start of the game blows my mind.
---
Does blizzard know that of the 3 EST PVP servers that one is the official BR server, another the official Spanish server, and the 3rd a streamer server?
---
That sounds like a good idea!
---
Yeah man no problem! Enjoy classic! Mage pride
---
Regardless of what you say or do, Blizzard is going to do what ever the fuck they want and think is best. All the crying and moaning without even seeing the last product is in vain and won't do anything. 
---
We don't fully know how it will be, how the game will progress or how big the population will be. Instead of already screaming that the game will be dead and classic is ruined let's maybe play the game lol. But sure we are wightknights that are here to defend blizzard. W/e that means. At least we are not coked up monkies with an obsession over the game that we need to cry about it every second.
---
All this post is saying that you don't know how the final product will be/the game will progress and are basing everything on history and a game/team that has nothing to do with classic. Maybe wait for the game to come out and then maybe you can scream like retarded monkies.
---
And a majority of the players HAD NO IDEA this was going on due to being on different layers.
---
1. Player 1 - Horde at Moonbrook Village
---
1. Player 2 - I just went there and nobody is there
---
1. Player 1 - Must be on a different layer. Too bad, soo sad.
---
4chan is still a thing?
---
I know. Problem is most streamers aren't announcing their server. So it fucks the whole name reservation regardless.
---
do most guilds take one spriest to raids tho? at least on horde side on pservers, guilds will take their two best/most geared warlocks and no spriest to naxxramas so even warlocks have to fight for spots, let alone spriests. most of the dps roster is just warriors and mages. maybe its different on ally side with threat reduction for warlocks, im not sure.
---
People who complain about no cst servers do so because they want to play in their time zone. They probably don't gaf that the servers are still located in Chicago. It's CRAZY how many people are saying BUT THEY'RE IN CHICAGO as if that's even the concern for people in cst.
---
People ask and people post these long explanations, it’s all reposting the same garbage.
---
I’m not pro-layering like you are framing me to be. Layering sucks, I can’t wait for it to be gone. But it’s the best temporary solution.
---
I don't think I've seen a single monitor setup in fucking years dude, do you hang around any nerds all? Even my friends with non technical jobs and hobbies have two.
---
People are basically overly dramatizing it.  I didn't have any bad experiences with layering and ran into guildies frequently.  Orgrimmar/TB were empty ... X-roads was packed with 15's.  I only went to Org for weapon skills, hidden enemies quest chain, and RFC once (probably \~10-15mins max).  That is the reason why it is empty.  One thing to note though is that people currently are getting separated from group members or not able to join the layer of the group they joined which is either a bug or strong downside to layering.  Either it is due to stress testing (and they are actively shifting layers around) or has to be due to sticky/cooldown feature of layering which is acting as a double edged sword (keeps down exploits/layer-jumping but also prevents legitimate interactions).
---
I  love how there is already pride for servers we've never even played on. Competition like this is what makes Classic so enjoyable.
---
If only there was a blue post or some sort of official calendar....
---
I know that I trusted Blizzard a lot more before they had anything to do with Activision.
---
Arghhh rogues
---
Ganking, "Streamer Privilege" aka ehite knights boosting them or their alts, and do on.
---
If it does not extend to exploits and such is the section I am arguing you ding dong. If it does extend further than they should be temp banned.
---
It’s the same launcher, however above the play button for world of Warcraft there is a drop down menu to switch it to classic. Hope that was clear enough :)
---
Yeah, you really need those. The ones I don't take are Backstab, Ambush, Rupture (maybe Garrote, too), Expose Armor, any poison other than Instant, and anything past rank 1 Kick.
---
Only if you're human/undead. An orc named Dennis is completely unrealistic.
---
Yea okay, half the people are intentionally bullshitting but let's just take everything at face value lol
---
You can't argue logic with these people. Negative karma for stating a fact.
---
Even 7-8 days /played would be on the faster side of things, and that puts you at 12-14 hours per day every day (for 14 days).
---
I'm definitely not saying you can't do it, just that reality will probably bite a lot of people in the ass.
---
Just reinstalled the launcher and it's working now! I think I might've been on the Beta launcher or something and that stopped it showing.
---
They call it to generate even more confusion. Both NA datacenters (Central and West) host servers of all timezones. It would be common sense to assume physical position is related to the server timezone, but it's not true at all. And still, people spread this false information as fact.
---
Yes: https://www.joanasworld.com/

Probably the best guide out there.

Nice! :) I'm just thankful that blizzard are giving us classic :) Blizzard is a big company I'm sure they know what they're doing :) We're just a bunch of stupid entitled consumers, I mean, what do we know, right? :) If they need to use layering thats fine by me :) Also you can sleep with my wife :)
---
Timmorow ar 320
---
There was no 'official stance' on classic one way or the other, because it was a joke to them. An afterthought. You only heard the opinion a few employees who bothered to respond to the questions.
---
But then Nost and the petitions happened. It's hard to argue those things.
---
this has been discussed to death already
---
Not sure i follow? He's trying to look like a gremlin on purpose? The meme is funny because he's nothing like robert B?
---
Streamers themselves aren't a problem usually but their retarded fans turn a server into twitch chat for their servers big streamer.
---
This is good shit.
---
Why argue something you clearly don't understand? If there's 10 people in the city, it fucking sucks. That's what people are saying here, it's supposed to be filled. I am 100% for Blizzard removing layering for main cities, even causing that instancing is 100% fine with me, as long as I see people in cities.
---
Well, It goers live globally at 3:00 pm Monday Aug 26th PST
---
That's the world of warcraft that you play
---
Yes it seems that way. But there wouldn’t be naming drama if the preplanned server groups shared naming database. And im pretty sure all they would have to say is “it’s this or layering” to get the classic community ok their side about it
---
When layering was announced at the classic wow media summit event a few months ago, it was suggested that guilds and friends should share layers, or at least have a propensity to be in the same layer as much as possible.  The blizzard devs liked the idea and agreed to implement something like that.
---
If the drop down does not say classic you will need to change it to classic.  It is pretty easy to press play and see if the loading screen is BFA or classic once you installed a copy if you can't read the drop down box.
---
Just throw it away; far as you can; and if it hits someone ; run lol
---
Why do so many of you people keep asking these easily googleable questions over and over...
---
Staysafe confirmed its not faerlina
---
Your wall of text says nothing about pvp on a pvp server. And you thought you were right too-how precious.
---
It’s a lot easier to run IMO
---
Who is getting downvotes?  I haven't looked at the thread since my first reply.
---
I have not been gatekeeping.  Describing someone as either a casual or hardcore is not mocking either type of player.  
---
All I said was that someone who takes the time out of their day to look things up, involve themselves in discussion, and vote on polls is more likely to take the game more seriously compared to a more casual player that doesn't do those things.  
---
All I said was that if you are posting on reddit, the forums, and discord, you are more likely to be a non-casual player.  That's it.
---
Whats the point if every entry is tba
---
How can I not upvote gramps with a great beard memeing and pitching his server
---
Alliance has generally always had stronger RP representation
---
soon, soon inst soon enough
---
You don’t have to buy BFA. Just sub and you’ll be able to play Classic. Have a good one.
---
Yeah it's a reaction from last three days, when the conversation that started as "man they nailed it" turned into "wah, layers cities are empty" where people complained layers were ruining everything. Which is ridiculous, the only two posts I saw about layers that were legit were the undercity noc despawn and the group despawn. Both of which are obviously bugs.
---
In case people are wondering the reason why cities felt empty is because no one was in them. There was no reason to be, try hanging out outside of VC or WC for 12 hours and tell me no one was in the stress test because layers. Its ridiculous.
---
Oh man, almost cried
---
It's more of players have different goals than Blizzard, so their conclusion is different.
---
No, there have been plenty of blue posts and interview responses. Those are absolutely 100% official and definitely did not represent only a single person's opinion on the matter. [Here](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/18194050354)'s a thread documenting at least some of them.
---
You fucking retard. Suck my dick.
---
I thought you just needed a subscription?
---
I’ve for than 1600 hours in ck2 and if there is something I’ve learned that is fabricating a claim to get my will. And I’ve with my northern brethren claim Shazzrah, and together with the colonial Britain and the Dutch Republic we’re gonna repeal the great threat that would otherwise destabilize Europe ... the dreaded Spanish Inquisition!
---
Layers are virtual sub-servers. If you add a new server or a virtual server it doesn't matter, because you wouldn't be able to interact with world pvp happening on a different server. So adding a new server doesn't help anything. You would just be on a server where this isn't happening, but why don't you instead just make it happen on your own layer, just like players on their own server would.
---
Yeah, no need to purchase BFA, the sub alone gets you classic and each expansion prior to the current one
---
Does the streamer entourage level up with them and put in any work to their characters?  If not I would see them getting slaughtered like lambs by any halfway competent raiding or pvp guild
---
The concern is more that one server will be the streamer server, while another will be the Brazil server. 
---
Numerous people don’t want to deal with either of those communities, and one PvP server for actual east coast players doesn’t seem like enough. That’s not to mention central players that choose EST over PST.
---
The most reliable way is to toss a coin.
---
What if I’m willing to invite anyone who’s got a good attitude and helps people in the world while I’m questing to 60. Guy wants to pvp but then later someone else gets invited and they want to pve. It’s not like we have to absolutely pick pvp or pve. Both can happen easily. Rank sole plays as raiders, the rest are just casual members. Call our pvp or invite each other via guild chat.
---
I'm rolling Faerlina for sure
---
$7.50 is worth it.
---
Lol ok
---
Oh look, a blizzard defense force npc in the wild.
---
It's still a good idea to sub a day or 2 early to make your characters. No reason to waste precious playing time creating your toon after it launches, especially since we don't know how stable the servers will be on launch day.
---
I think they want new people to play.
---
Will it be roleplay if i speak in Turkish 🤔
---
That's great news ! Maybe I can get off of these awful settings then!
---
yeah, what are people expecting from a small indie company like Blizzard?!
---
You can level to 110 as well and all packs before BFA
---
Imagine if you could say "THOT" as PC as "incel".
---
I tried getting in touch with an old guild mate and guy my brother went to college with. Turns out the number in my phone is no longer him and I had this awkward exchange.
---
I can't wait for SS vs TM
---
And those people base their claims on 100% speculation. Temporary, as in not permanent, qualifies at temporary. There’s no difference between weeks or months
---
Staysafe isn't the streamer that everyone is worried about.
---
Excuse me, this post is a video that includes content that is not autistically screeching about how busted layering is and how classic wow is already dead before it even launches. 
---
Please remove this post IMMEDIATELY or you will be sent to gulag.
---
Wasn't a bunch of the team working in. Classic fired a couple of months ago when Blizzard fired 800 employees ?
---
We'll see. I reserve my judgment until I actually play the game.
---
Yeah I agree , all it takes is good organization
---
&gt; This also goes for "this is just a beta" / "this will change on release" / etc.
---
OOF i get Anthem flashbacks.

But why is he playing human when he is undead irl?

Is this some new copypasta
---
Thank you. I’ve been saying this and was downvoted, called a Shill or a Blizzard Dicksucker repeatedly.
---
Thanks for getting the word out.
---
TBH that's what I'm leaning. I figure it will just be more of a nuisance every now and then as opposed to a constant infestation...though that's probably the optimist in me...
---
Keine Holländer auf meinem Server!
---
largest private server had same rule as classic has
---
&gt; ... When communicating with other users and staff, you may not: ... Use non-English language in public channels.
---
maybe that could be the reason behind seeing english in public channels?
---
Thank you! This post is so helpful brother
---
My worries are not about layering itself, is more about jumping between layers out of control, even out of your control.
---
Maybe i meet great guys in a layer that its not mine (because we are grouped). Then i leave party, and a leave the layer too. I'll never again see these guys running around just to wave them. Only if i group up i'll see them again, isn't it?
---
The problem is that phase 3 needs to come pretty quickly after phase 2 too. Phase 2 will give pvpers an incentive to kill any player on sight for honor, its going to be a nightmare for casual players who just wanna lvl up and all of a sudden get camped all day and night in any questing area 50+.
---
With that in mind, phase 1 will last much longer and then phase 2 will be kinda short, followed by phase 3 being longer again.
---
7pm but it doesnt start until the 30th. See you then
---
And isn't Thalnos confirmed to be the go-to Brazil server?
---
The point of these stress tests are for Blizzard to to mess around turning a million different knobs to find the right setup for launch. In doing that they're going to try to push the limits of the servers and find how few layers they can get away with, etc. So obviously there are going to be times when it's not performing well. It has nothing to do with the quality of the servers or how the experience will be when the servers go live. They're trying to break it.
---
Just like they fixed everything else they've said they would?

I resubbed last night. Did a fast gear up of that benthic armor, and now I'll use that character for farming token gold between now and launch. I don't know how effective it will be, but I can't seem to play other games right now. I'm in preparation mode.
---
I trained 3 days ago specifically for today.
---
What does that mean in relation to what I said?
---
Seems stupid? Nah it’s the most intelligent post on here!
---
Congrats!!! I’m doing something similar! :D
---
Yes I get 100 to 120 on classic at max but only 60 on retail.
---
&gt; (250 hours)/(5 hours per day) = 50 days, or a little over a month and a half.
---
And let's remember that playing 5 hours per day, *every day*, is probably unrealistic for many adults. If you get home from work by 6:00pm every day and let's say you spend 1hr to cook/eat, 1hr to clean/spend time with your family or partner or dog, then you start playing around 8:00pm. Play for 5 hours straight and you're going to bed at 1:00-1:30am, and I imagine most people are getting up for work anywhere from 6:30am to 7:30am which is only 5-6 hours of sleep.
---
And all of that is just assuming every day is the same. What about the day when your partner wants to go out for dinner, or friends want to see a movie, or your parents want you to come visit, or you need to run errands, etc. Finding that 5 hour average is going to be HARD for anyone on a standard 9-5 schedule. 
---
I'm estimating that I'll be able to play 2 hours pretty consistently every weekday, sometimes up to 4 or 5 if I'm lucky, so probably an average of ~3hrs per day. On weekends I'm betting I'll have anywhere from 3-5hrs consistently, with some days up to 6 or 7, so an average of maybe 4.5hrs on weekend days *if* I'm home. This puts my weekly average around 24hrs. So roughly 10 weeks or 2.5ish months.

Same here. I'm not gonna waste 14 days of sub just to possibly reroll on a new server they release 6 hours after the launch.

Ich finde es ok, wenn dieser kulturelle Teil Deutschlands aufgenommen wird. Ich finde es nicht gut, wenn Deutschland auf die bayrische Kultur reduziert wird, was hier gar nicht der Fall ist.

Oh nooo

If what I said was confusing, then I think I should ask you the same thing.

People who claim to be invested in the vanilla wow project while also insisting we should have full faith in blizzard (praise be upon them, for they know more than we) stick out like weeds, btw.

Going Atiesh with the educated guess that the better name will have more people on it.

---
My experience with Necrosis is
---
1. It's buggy, the Soul Shard manager often deletes too many shards.
---
2. It has a ton of features that I have no use for. A lot of people use Necrosis purely for the Soul Shard management. I want there to be a better option.
---
This addon solves both these issues.
---
just lie and make up shit if they cant type the same dam words into google. Hmmm let me type this into reddit instead of Google.
---
Supposedly, but the actual % of the server population that would constitute is up in the air. I’ve heard as low as 10%. And they are also supposedly committing to prioritizing English first.
---
I’ve also heard faerlina is the more Spanish speaking first community.
---
It’s all up in the air right now
---
Even just to do my voidwalker quest in UC because in my layer UC had ZERO NPCS.....
---
Yes and Latin American
---
Might aswell have titled it "You think you do, but you don't"
---
Still better than 10 hour queues and the server having 30 people playing after 6 months... or being able to gather 100 black lotuses in 15 minutes
---
Hmm. Ya it definitely has me worries. More so now that you said that ☹️
---
You’ll want rupture to defend yourself if you are on a PvP server. The rest of those you can skip for sure.
---
I did this, too. Planned end of August vacation for several months ahead of release date announce, and then when I went to actually request off officially I realized I wielded some horrible power - I could take additional time off to play the week after release and the missus would just have to deal, since I won't be in town for launch. She gets a vacation with me, and I get a second vacation with WoW. 
---
I'll let you know how it goes when she leaves me.
---
This is exactly the case and it ruins the game.
---
You dont condemn people for things they can't control. That makes you an idiot, are you an idiot
---
They're not telling you how to, they are challenging you to not use it to experience the game in a different way. Difference
---
Must be nice to have your head in the clouds as such an optimist. I hope you don't eat your words but I bet you will.
---
Yeah I was discussing this with some people in game. There is no way wow classic should have fewer players than star wars the old republic, but I worry if big names don't get behind it and do videos and streams on it, it will be. Blizzard has done next to  nothing to advertise the game and the 25-45 year olds who will play it regardless have lives and jobs that will make it difficult for large numbers of them to play consistently. Blizzard needs fresh blood but hasn't done anything to get it.
---
That's my point - they claimed that's how it would work, but has someone tested it to any degree?
---
That tells me a lot about Asmon.
---
Well, if it is feel free to paypal me $7,5 :\^ )
---
Dang it i wanted to be Robotman :(
---
I never said a word about Switzerland
---
Curt Schillings for sure.
---
So this will be the sever with the most banned players.
---
Because they literally said the thresholds were tuned way differently than they would be when it goes live, for the purpose of testing the feature.
---
Good thing there are [24 official languages](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/eu-languages_en) for EU.
---
I paid my sub prior to the weekend so I could do the stress test and do a quick leveling up for a refresher, then be able to do name reservations today, worth it to me, but I understanding waiting too.
---
Finally someone makes an extensive post on why layering is bad.
---
Yeah, I'll probably re-sub the evening before and make characters so I'm ready to go when the servers launch.
---
His argument is not stupid, the problem is that for stress test layer sizes were on purpose lower than they will be on live. On live each layer should be 3000 people like Vanilla servers.
---
He is his argument in a more detailed way.
---
Let's say you have a server with 30000 people and 300 people in stormwind. That means 1% of people are in stormwind of everyone playing. These 30000 people are split into 10 layers to match Vanilla server capacity and have 3000 people each and 30 people in each layer of stormwind.
---
If blizzard decided to not do layering then they make 10 times more servers and each server has 3000 people now instead of 30000 and since only 1% of people at the time playing are in stormwind, there will be only 30 people in stormwind.
---
For you to see more people early on in cities while everyone is level 5 and has no reason to be in a city, they would have to do mega servers like some private servers where the server cap is 15000+ players, but thats not how vanilla was. Vanilla server cap was 2000-3000.
---

Alliance really need to step their game up on Herod and Whitemane both. I don't want to roll on Faerlina ffs.
---
I'm so down.
---
Pro tip: if your name is really important to you, swap initial name reservations with a friend! So you claim their names, they claim yours. Then you get in voice coms, choose the appearance you want for your character, type in the name your friend reserved, then hover your finger over the enter key until your friend deletes their character with that name. Sort of convoluted, but if you want one of the popular "oprawindfury" - type of highly sought after names, its worth a shot.
---
Lock in a dungeon farm comp? Nope.
---
best bet is to try and find a friend that can take it while you customize the character. I'd just go onto a private server and get your look down and practice making it quickly. The odds of someone trying to claim your name in the minute you will take to create the character features is vedry small but not impossible.
---
I will confirm that I basically resubbed yesterday so I can be ready to go at 5 to reserve my names. Even snuck WoWC on my work computer so I can get to it right away, because I am high on the power of IT and need an intervention.
---
So you're saying that the game will be ruined by something you can't notice?
---
I think you're just afraid you said it would negatively impact us 200+ times while leveling, because it's a ridiculous estimate.
---
Conservatism is not an extremist opinion.
---
Same but i think ill cave and take the nordic one for more guild options in the end...
---
Also - none of us make money by paying for less servers and admins.
---
Ohh. Then just wait until she discovers Mind Control and Mana Burn :O
---
I imagine there's zero chance any of them plan on using "their" names anyway. They're smart enough to know that even without all this "controversy" the likelihood that they're going to get their streaming names is very low. I would guess most of them have alternate names picked out and those are the ones they are going for.
---
Towellie was very negative toward classic for a long time. I doubt many of his viewers like classic.
---
We dont know that this guy is truthful
---
I've never multi-boxed, it seems very expensive and complicated. Is there a big payoff or is it just a fun way to play for you?
---
They think they do, but they don't. ;)
---
&gt; Layering is just a COST saving measure for blizzard
---
Of all the arguments you can make against layering, that is certainly one of the weakest ones.  Datacenters today are nothing like what they were back in 2005.  It would cost them next to nothing to spin up additional servers.  
---
&gt;there are 4 servers for what will be over 100 000 NA players
---
There are 11 NA servers not 4, and the 100k is nothing but your complete guess.  Accurately estimating the initial demand and attrition rate is the hard part of this whole layering thing - if they don't estimate correctly things will be bad one way or another, but at least they have some data on which to base their decisions.

How can you tell which faction will be dominant? Seems like there’s just going to be a big population there

Esfand said on his discord about 5 mins ago they're discussing it right now and want to release it before the name reservation is live. Tips also said on his discord just now they've come to a decision and he's waiting for the ok to release it.

Arguing on reddit about layering
---
I remember being able to skin a corpse twice (as one player) for a while in either vanilla or bc, so this is probably accurate.

Well do it on flight paths then, your framerate doesn't affect the movement of it due to it being server-side and out of your control

Do I really need a subscription or can I just buy game time?
---
Blizzard have gone back on their word before. See: Classic happening in the first place
---
&gt;-The stress test is NOT an example of how the game will perform on live, that goes for layering and other features
---
I've been playing this game since Burning Crusade came out, time and time again I've seen people use this defense when something in an Alpha/Beta is bad. I wont say it always ends this way, but more often than not (especially with Modern Blizzard) it does. 
---
"It's just an Alpha"
---
"It's just a Beta relax!"
---
*(You are here)*
---
"They just released it, give them a little while!"
---
"Next patch they'll fix it"
---
"Well they're a little busy im sure next expansion they'll fix it"
---
The only way you stop this from happening is making noise *now* rather than waiting for the infinitely shifting goal post to stop moving. You might say people making posts constantly about the same issue isn't helpful, and I would disagree provided it isn't the same person every time. 
---
If the community does not voice its concerns over and over, nothing will change, and even then there's no guarantee Blizzard will listen to begin with.
---
Not a matter of competition - what this is demonstrating is duplication. Twice as much leather. If you had 40 leatherworkers and really good timing you could get 40 skins off Ony.
---
Bullshit, got any proof or just riding the anti-circlejerk?
---
I went to SW and it was completely empty.

I forgot about name reservation until a few days ago and I currently can't afford ro resub. Will be waiting until launch praying that my semi-generic-yet-still-obscure-enough-to-be-cool name isn't taken

Lol literally zero impact. Right off the bat the server has the wrong time for their schedule. But no impact!

---
&gt;Temporary, as in not permanent, qualifies at temporary. There’s no difference between weeks or months
---
So if it lasted five years you'd refer to it as "temporary"?  Not saying it will, just showing how it's a ridiculous word to use in some situations.
---
People are clutching onto the last straws of hope they have that what they are seeing isn't the final product. But we all know in this day and age that betas and full games only have the slightest of differences, and the major things that most of us see as huge issues are still going to be in full release.

I am installing WoW on my old Sagar laptop tonight just for my wife.  She said she will try it with me when it releases.  Kind of curious to see it running on the old 880M GPU anyways.  I suspect we are going to need a second desktop soon.  Zug Zug
---
Anything else, even the same system with greater transparency. It would be less obnoxious not seeing people on layer 1 if I knew it's because I'm on layer 2 (and I also know I'm not being bounced around.) I just don't want people to be arbitrarily popping in and out as anonymous phantoms, like retail.
---
1,000,000 - are you having a laugh mate?
---
Not once did you mention an exploit. You said players shouldn't be able to corpse camp others frequently.
---
Clearly Blizzard disagrees.
---
Probably because THEY HAVE ANOTHER SERVER TYPE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO PVP
---
I don’t know what you mean by “good try.” 
---
I just don’t personally see spending money on game time and only getting half that time to actually play to be a good deal.

I plan to only PvP, I have not gotten a good death threat since BC. With nothing to do for first couple phases I am hoping to earn some more.
---
Warrior-Priest is the best combo for duo leveling.
---
In going with warrior/Paladin/priest/Mage/lock, but I’m a sucker for mixed comps.
---
Yeah you made me think... My name is not gonna be taken by anyone, so I will customize my character, its only a couple seconds. Don't wan't to take the risk.
---
The way they did it last time, waiting until l a server population was low and forcibly merging them was a big contributor to the rapid decline of the WOW player base. I think everyone complaining about layers completely underestimates how fast server merges will kill a community.
---
Ask yourself this, if server merges were what they did in the past, why wouldn't they do them now if they were effective/easier?
---
Nostalrius isn't the only private server either, so I'm not sure why everyone is wanting them to have all the credit for everything.
---
Too bad everyone is focused on layering because spell batching is fucking stupid.
---
I have watched many things and kept up to date, and I swear they never claimed no layering. They said no *sharding*, if that is what you mean.
---
Well cant go home if im on a dead layer
---
Personal health that will be neglected once classes and classic start on the same day
---
Learning to fly RC planes.
---
You simply do not understand the concept of building a relationship with other players, do you?
---
Why is the assumption the second that it's asked for layering to be removed that the only possible alternative is a hundred days and nights of 24/7 hour long queues? There are other options and there are wait times that could be minutes. Blizz has the technology as a multibillion dollar company to host more than the paltry amount of servers they've decided on for classic.
---
My dad thought WoW was putting a virus on the family computer, too. Made me delete it. My boyfriend ended up lending me his laptop so we could play together. The man never stopped to think that all the "music" my brother was downloading off of Limewire or WinMX was causing the issue.

asmon said he might play there, he doesn't know yet. he said he will talk to them off stream.

I mean that’s a smart way to do it honestly.
---
Basic thinking and rationel seems to lost on reddit. Not like it's going to change your oppinion on the matter regardless of what a source will say.
---
&gt; I'm sorry but do you guys genuinely not grasp the concept of layering?
---
No, we just don't extrapolate a couple of clips of a superminority on a subreddit with the actual frequency that we'll get in normal gameplay.
---
Looks like a few streamers have chosen Faerlina... Asmongold has yet to announce. I'd put money on him rolling Herod just to be a dick.
---
I'm out of the loop, why is everyone wanting to harass streamers? What did they do?
---
Also, are there any "official" servers for each faction? I was planning to roll Alliance on Mankrik but some friends said, "That's a Horde server".

The plot thickens...

5 people vs 5 multiboxering people, same number of players. :) Who wins? The 5 multiboxers. 
---
I think if you're going to multi-box you're going to have to put in the input for each window. It's literally an unfair advantage otherwise, hence WHY people do it.

He has a point.  Golemagg even sounds like a thug name.

Love you too baby ❤️❤️❤️

So the game is going to be ruined by something no one noticed? 
---
Legolas variants
---
We don't know if any servers are located in chicago.  They could all be in LA.
---
Legalize Felweed for real though
---
Imagine if you were on a completely separate realm instead 😱
---
Right it would be hilarious and what I would do except I'd split a 15hr day between the 3 pvp servers
---
This must be fake since people on this sub tells me you can't see other players
---
Guess im weird as fuck then. Lmao imagine being this insecure.
---
Sorry yes, was about to reply to you on my phone but got distracted and put it in my pocket - my other message is entirely autocorrect.
---
This is why you roll Horde... Right here, you seen it, it's done.  OP has single handedly changed the balance of every server in one post!
---
There is 0% chance Asmongold won't be on Faerlina.
---
No. Friends lists exist. If you meet people, add them and you will have no issues playing with them.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6iVlTKfU00
---
Many of the players that will play classic haven\`t even bought BFA.
---
Guys, give it time. The servers will be stormed the first 2-3 days with a fuckton off ppl. After that the playbase will fast go down, after all ppl leave that just wanted to try out + streamers.
---
That's why they do the layering stuff in the first days ...
---
After some cool down time, they will decide if there are enough players to open additional servers or not. It's not about money at this point, but simply because too many servers at start will mean they need to fusion some later on and this will be even a bigger shitstorm then before.
---
That was in the interests of porting wow to the new consoles coming out.
---
Gorillas and orangutans but not baboons
---
We saw the feedback and wanted to help the most people possible. We've been discussing this for days and trying to get everyone on the same page. Hope this helps a bit, wish we could have announced it sooner but there were a lot of different opinions being suggested. That said, best wishes to all.
---
Streamers bullied me in high school, stole my crush and now they are going to play on MY server
---
Don’t think he’d roll on a different server than everyone else. If those guys really are going Faerlina, he probably will too.
---
Personally, it’s a nice way to get 4 alts to 60 for the price of 1, lets you farm 5-mans for targeted drops without waiting on bodies or having anyone roll against you, and gives you some extra muscle and gathering professions out in the world.  
---
Cost is really nothing in regards to other things people spend money on.
---
Good try but I actually got people caring for me so that one won't work ;)
---
*Looks at Asmon...*
---
What is the financial incentive of removing it if people have already put up with it from the beginning?
---
which group of streamers is this? the only one i don't want to share a server with is asmon

You gave him nightmares, he probably doesn't know that classic is a game and he is never going to play music ever again. poor lad.
---
i really wish blizzard would've announced where each server was physically located before this.
---
They also told StarCraft 2 players that they didn't want a b.net that wasn't hot garbage.
---
because they were all busy in Westfall or Dun Morgogh or  Tristfall Glades.   At lvl 7 or lvl 13 you don't need to visit a city.   Class trainers are in the lvl 10 areas.  Nothing to store in bank.  AH not very useful since it's only a  weekend / few days.  Battlegrounds not a factor.
---
Really there is almost no reason for 95% of the players to be in a city for more than a few minutes max and many won;t even set a step there at all.
---
No. There are no specific RP/RP-PVP chat rules, only naming rules. You can say and do whatever you want on an RP/RP-PVP realm so long as it would also be allowed on a PVP/Normal realm.

I'm glad you do my friend. Fingers crossed those people get on the same layer as you xoxo

Yup. I was telling people about joining this channel on Barov yesterday. But this will reach WAY more people.

There's nothing like questing in Darkshore and still being able to join that Deadmines group that's forming in Westfall because groups are using the worldwide channel to look for members instead of zone chat.

No one is saying Blizzard can't afford more servers, it would cost them nothing extra to make more. Layering isn't to save Blizzard server money, it's to avoid adding more launch servers than the long term population will be able to populate. That's the whole point of layering.
---
Everyone keeps complaining and yet I haven't seen a better solution to deal with the problem of over-population on launch and the inevitable pop decline down the road.
---
You’re also getting multiboxers horde side, so have fun with that too.

We plan to run dungeons together, help each other out with quests, hang out and chat, and just enjoy our return to Azeroth.
---
We will raid and do battlegrounds at level 60, but there is no pressure to rush to 60 or to take part in either.
---
**Expectations**

Thanks for this.  I knew it in my heart but I'm still among the idiots putting myself in a fit and quickly forming a rash.
---
I'll change my diaper and get back to being an adult.
---
If that were true theyd just add a microtransaction store to classic. They underestimated the demand but to suggest they think they are purposely gonma do a shit job on classic which will somehow get ppl to jump back on shitty retail if they werent already on it is still wrong. It makes no sense. They get classic subs each month for a game needing no dev time and little maintenance...
---
A tryhard private server Alliance pvp guild that apparently makes playing Horde annoying to the point that servers started having fewer Horde players. Probably won't be an issue on the Blizzard servers since so many people will be on these 2 servers but yeah.
---
stop replying to threads
---
Hmm. So sacrifice the classic experience for maybes and assumptions that Blizzard could clearly fix? No thanks
---
I wonder how vanilla was such a success without layering.
---
Wait how? You just researched for all this information and you are still in favor of Layering? Is this an out of season April\`s Fool joke?
---
Click raw data. It may not even load.
---
Streamers are going either Grommulus or Thalnos for easier PvP bracket fixing.
---
I'm leaning towards the RP PvP realm because any hardcore RP can be done on the RP realm, I played on Ravenholdt US, and the majority didnt RP, it was just an older crowd looking to escape kidiots with names like xXIllidanXx or Arthasbrother, etc. So its basically just a less populated PvP realm.
---
Thalnos will be loaded with South American players who will make the PvP honor farm asy with their high ping. 
---
This will piss off either a part of the RP community, but ultimately merge them into 1 big community like Emerald Dream, or it will piss off South Americans who then spill out into other servers and piss off everyone else.
---
The best case would be for RP to concede the RP PvP realm for streaming
---
/ignore
---
Why would they care to do that? Spanish and Portuguese are as different as English is versus either one of them.
---
Get the fuck off my Discord.
---
I mean your statement reads like you are accounting for all Classic realms in the world. Which I believe there are 34 or so. If you are just accounting for NA/EU you should clarify it better.
---
No one cares the game will live on without you.
---
Hey man! Just want to chime in and thank you for doing this. I love watching streamers, but it’s undeniable that it changes the game from the Vanilla experience. Looking forward to playing the game separately but tuning in for your content 🤙
---
It's not a problem on retail servers. Most guilds are English speaking and combine people from all over Europe and beyond.
---
Can asmongold stop being a douchebag and tell us what realm he is playing
---
Wouldn’t feel as bad to be honest. 
---
I knew there was an event in the same zone on the same server from the general chat. I asked to be invited so I can join the layer, but I guess the raid groups were full and they were too busy fighting the Alliance.
---
I mean, I called it back in the twilight days of TBC when paid server and faction transfers started that it would kill communities and servers.
---
I was right then, and I'm right now about layering.
---
I'm glad you guys are being very upfront about this and candid.  Hopefully Asmongold follows in your footsteps and announces his plan.
---

you can just bind Flip Camera and no longer have to manually move the camera to look backwards and then back

No need for walljumps to get to the airstrip. You can go there from Loch Modan and only have to do one _slightly_ more tricky jump just at the start. Or, you know, if you just jump from the end of the road next to the graveyard of Ironforge.
---
Understandable - at the end of the day this is what people wanted. Thanks for letting people know
---
I hope he does - would love to gank him.
---
thanks nick.
---
and german
---
For once I agree with Asmon.
---
Wendy's spicy nuggs are legit.
---
As long as you reserve the name that should be enough to remake the character quickly on release. To be sure male one with your desired name then practice doing you class and appearence as quick as possible.
---
That way you will only risk you name being taken for like 20sec come release night :)
---
They're lying.
---
Incoming: every variation from xxxLegolasxxx to any combo of altered characters conceivable
---
Not yet. Asmongold is the one to be feared. As childish as he is, it wouldnt be a surprise if he ended rolling on Herod.
---
I'll pass on turning my gaming experience into a virtual race war (unless we're talking humans vs orcs), but enjoy yourself.
---
RIP thalnos.

Kapp
---
Yeah they came out today again
---
They literally said it won't be in phase 2. When is phase 2? I don't know.
---
He really looks like a rat. He is also missing several teeth. You can see when he open his mouth.
---
Yes, I managed to test MSBT and it worked.
---
What is blizzards projected player numbers? I'm honestly guessing 1 million + I get the feeling they are expecting 250k.
---
&gt;single-use appliance or food product
---
Except a business like a restaurant does not sell food, it sells service, it is a service industry. And if I get **bad service** then I complain and demand better. I can't do the same for this one? You claim I try to have it both ways when you are doing the exact same thing.
---
I wasn’t signed up for the betas I think you could be right.
---
Very true
---
Asmon will be facing us without other streamers to help then. Sodapoppin just announced the other big streamers will be going to Faerlina and not Herod. So we didn't "fuck ourselves" at all. My bet is he doesn't go to Herod.
---
It's very appreciated
---
Don't have it to hand but didn't the wording suggest that the end of phase 1 would be the latest that they get rid of layering, and if feasible they'll do it much earlier? 'cos if phase 1 does last for six months or a year there'll be very substantial dropoff from launch. As such layering won't be needed by then
---
&gt; piss off a handful of purists
---
For the love of God, I hope they elect to do this. But "muh uhmurshun!"
---
I think I speak from the whole community when I say they we are very grateful about your choice and transparency!
---
Now if only i could figure out a name for my main &gt;_&lt;

They literally laid out a plan that says they would. Thats as much proof as there possibly could be that it will be removed.

I deeply respect this decision and it's very noble. Let's hope the streamsnipers can now leave them alone and enjoy the game for themselfs. Streaming is not/no longer part of the game, so nor is streamsniping.

It's meant as a joke buddy.
---
He might have gotten the itch after you asked him and went to mess around as a trial account
---
I don’t think you understand what’s even happening in this discussion. 
---
We’re not discussing an opinion. We’re discussing something you proclaimed as a fact and I asked if you had proof that it’s a fact. 
---
And you’re wrong that I wouldn’t change my mind, because that’s what reasonable people do when presented with information that says otherwise. If you have any evidence to support your claim that it’s ‘too late’ for Blizzard to make any changes to layering I would love to see it.
---
Blizzard's focus testing shows players like sprinkles, not vanilla.  Blizzard's president likes sprinkles too.
---
So it would look really bad if they had more vanilla servers than sprinkle servers.
---
real release date is whenever phase 2 drops
---
It should work. I will do it that way.
---
From what I understand you can delete your character and then remake at a quieter time for the desired look
---
I know I’m kind of impressed tbh
---
Yeah... Imo that is the biggest problem. 
---
That you can see the same chat.. if layers are meant to be like separate realms then they should be further separated..
---
I don’t know if you have thought this thru and disagree or if you are just brand new to competive vanilla, kargath/BRM/yojamba wipes, ungoro turf wars, world bosses,  etc. 
---
Sappers and LIPed mages are insane if they connect well. It’s very common for 40vs40 between “equal” raids to end 40-0. And wiping x2 or x3 your number is pretty normal. Stream viewers are not nearly as alert or cohesive as a proper raid group, 20 vs 200 is a stretch maybe, but it’s not a joke.
---
Asmon will probably roll on a PvE server. So many people hate him that he will be hunted 24/7.

nice but looocks a bit like a german Rentner

Yea and they're right. A large number of people will bail on classic in the first few months after realizing what classic is. There's just a notably sized community that does actually want Classic
---
Apex legends is releasing a solo's-only mode as of tomorrow.  Gonna be a whole new twist on the game, cant wait.  That'll hold me over for a couple of weeks.

No. On US Servers there are central and eastern time servers hosted in Los Angeles. Along with that, there are pacific standard time servers hosted in Chicago.

Good. Fuck you and most of the idiots on this sub. I hope he continues to fuck with all you cry babies even more because it's hilarious.

 Horde quest there beginning lvl 20, while Alliance go there at lvl 30.  Tarren Mill vs. Southshore is the first place most players see each other.

You're clearly missing the point. There are more players than you think that don't give a fuck what others are saying they will do.

I'm not going to change my mind because "streamers have declared Faerlina as their own" or "Herod is strictly a no streamer server"

**PvP**: While we're not too pvp focused, we still want to do some organized wpvp together during phase 1 and 2 and premade battlegrounds later on. If theres a high demand we will do even more PvP stuff, like city raids and duel tournaments. 
---
Most importantly, we wish our members to help each other, even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange!
---
&gt;*One of us is being ganked by those annoying undead rogues in lakeshire?*
---
&gt;**Go and help him out**
---
&gt;*One of us is short a tank for a dungeon?* 
---
&gt;*You need help with a difficult task?*
---
&gt; **We will help you out!**
---
**Goals/Hopes/Dreams**:
---
- big &amp; friendly community
---
- become a known and popular guild on our server
---
- PH4T L00TZ
---
- enjoying Classic together
---
____
---
**Recruitment**: We have a pretty balanced roster and don't lack any specific classes right now so we're recruiting every class and role (except Main Tanks for Phase 1).
---
We still need a warlock and a mage class leader though so we're currently looking for a socially capable player who knows the class inside and out in all context and is willing to help others. Class leaders will also be part of the loot councils and recruit more members of their class if needed.
---
If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!
---
***In any case, HAVE A CLASSIC SUMMER!*** :)
---
Playing on the stress test is not a waste, it’s reserving for names only and then not playing for 2 weeks that I think is a waste of money
---
Wish I bothered to go to Hyjal one last time, but it was fun having a little [send-off with my layer group](https://imgur.com/a/bSdhAHT) instead, the journey to Stormwind!
---
yes and no
---
they're still the same blizzard that released features like LFG and LFR because 'they knew better'
---
Without layering, those 44 other people wouldn't be there anyway, they would be on another server. Forever.
---
You don't really make any friends from levels 1-25, so don't worry about these kinds of things. At that point, people just have shit to get done. When it comes time to make friends the layering will be done.
---
You’re going to pass on making Azeroth great again? Bummer, need as many troopers as possible.

It is not unreasonable and I really do thank you for linking it, however I remain suspicious as to why they haven't spoken similarly for this test then, unless there's something they are worried about or wish to keep under wraps. I don't think its unreasonable to be personally concerned about that.

Dude apply on Blizzard youve simplified what they werent able to.

As for how long; no idea.

Tfw you learn that “the heart of the cards” is just getting a lucky top deck

I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster
---
&gt;Blizzard said "you think you do, but you don't"
---
Which still might be true on a scale thats big enough for blizzard to care. WoW Classic may be booming right now, may get a million players... but will it have anywhere near that amount in 3 months? 6 months? a year? Maybe, maybe not. Acting like the hype for it now proves them wrong is silly.
---
Lol this fool trying to complain about a rollercoaster not being up to “his standards” and demanding a refund at the Six Flags.

Sit down and quit ruining this sick ass coaster for the rest of us!

No shit

Added the chat channel confusion to (1-) and (7-) Oversized Community Pre-Attrition as a con in the ways I think are fair. Seems a better way to summarize than Immersion, since it's related more to economic than suspension of disbelief. 
---
I do think there's more players disappearing and appearing, but not in a different or surprising manner when logging in and out exists. As long as mobs don't phase, we're still close enough to Vanilla on the immersion front. 
---
Still not sure about the step in and out, because we don't know how sticky it's supposed to be to begin with. Most of the others are 'known' to the extent they can be without solid Word of Blizz. May look for things to evidence the definitions later.
---
The only correct answer.
---
This is all I wanted. In my mind this is officially a Bro Move on behalf of all the streamers in the tweet. 
---
Thanks for understanding and thanks for respecting our choice of Herod. And I still might end up on your server if Asmon doesn't follow your lead, in which case I look forward to playing with you.
---
Dicks out for Herod!!!!
---
This is a really nice move by the streamers.  Bottom line is their server will be more than full with fanboys no matter where they go.  Nice to see them work with the community on this one.  I sure as hell wouldn't want to roll a streamer server, but props are due here.
---
Big cooperation never make mistakes, it was always all long con a big plan.
---
Was messing up retail and losing millions of subs also a part of their all knowing plan?
---
Pretty much this. Guarantee myself any rare boes,  flask recipes, and most preraid bis. Plus I may stream it once I've got it down
---
But do they know better than me? 10/10 me's agree, we aren't sure.
---
You know the guy who won the roll didn't need it and his group was just trolling him, right?
---
Pretty simple explanation for that. Blizzard claimed in a recent blue post that to counter layer hopping they put a 5 minute cooldown on players abilities to change layers. If you login, you "layer hopped", so you have to wait 5 minutes before you can do so again. We just do the first 2 quests grouped but each in our own layer and then one is automatically moved after 5 minutes.
---
Thex, asmongold, legolas ,Esfand
---
Layering is there to help the game have a more successful launch. I'm looking for a financial reason for them to keep it after they said it would be gone no later than Phase 2.
---
It was definitely the insistence of the private server community, although some streamers definitely helped it along ( ty esfand )
---
Extremely cool of you guys to do this. I think a ton of people here recognize the value you guys add to the Classic community - so many people on reddit were fired up that WoW was at the top of Twitch when the beta first launched. People do enjoy the publicity of this game that we all love.
---
That said, and it seems the streamers are aware, the experience playing with you guys is just, different. But no need to dwell on that.
---
Thank you, Esfand and others, for allowing both a 'normal' server to exist in Herod. I'm looking forward to rolling on that server and enjoying my experience with Classic - but I also look forward to watching you guys stream and enjoy the game too.
---
Depends on where you live. It's releasing at the same time throughout the world. So midnight the 27th in Paris. Whatever time that happens to be for where you live is when it releases.
---
Omg let it go ur ruining this subreddit
---
They know more and that just makes every fuck-up more monumental.
---
Was he crying when he said it?
---
To all the snarky comments being like "lol people were wrong, layering doesn't actually prevent capital cities from being ghost towns":
---
This was people in 1 layer inviting everyone they could find online into raid groups so they could be on the same layer. Organically it would be nothing like this.
---
It's far from a subjective matter, as it can be found among many examples online that players are having greater difficulties finding people and grouping with friends in the layering system. And when I have the same problem, I figure it's time to complain.
---
I think you have to much faith in blizzard. Don't expect the best result, Lord knows you won't get it.
---
The old Minnesota Vikings punter, had warcraft in his twitter handle I believe

We are literally just asking for them to remove it from cities and make it more like they described. They clearly lied about how it was supposed to work.

[Found the statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cp3uh3/blizzard_needs_to_fix_layering_before_the_wow/ewn9tg5/). It's from before the last stress test here, but there's no reason to think the same doesn't apply.
---
That's because the only people who played those servers were people who actively were seeking them out. Of course they'll have good retention. WOW classic on the other hand *will* have a very significant drop off as loads of people who started with modern retail hop onto the servers to "check out what original wow was like" get to level 20 and go back to retail. 
---
The way they've set up the release is basically guaranteed to make that happen.
---
Rather that than 10 hour queues, or dead servers a month after launch.
---
Sandwich is better
---
Oof. That's a no dog. They *might* be the biggest reason Classic hits a peak of X-players. Where X is some figure larger than it would have been were it not for Blizzard essentially letting Streamers market the game for them.
---
They definitely are *not* responsible for it getting done in the first place. Thank Nost and other pserver folks for that.
---
Small spicy chicken nuggets and a jr bacon cheeseburger was my go to.  It just wasn't the same without the spicy nuggets.
---
Good
---
I get the point that a lot of people here is trying to make ("it doesn't make any sense to open a server for each language, because there are so many different languages but not that many players of those languages by country"), and I do agree to an extent, but why would you make a case of this with Spanish? 
---
There are 20 countries that speak Spanish as a main language (and most of them are in America, not in Europe), and there are hundreds, if not thousands, of WoW players in them (like in Argentina, Spain or Mexico). And then there are other countries, like the US, where minorities do speak Spanish as well. Just look at how many Spanish WoW private servers there are out there, dozens. 
---
The reason the Spanish speaking community is targeting a server is not so two or three guilds can clear PvE content, it's because a couple thousands of players that speak Spanish, and are not fluent in English (which only makes sense, since there's a WoW client in Spanish with Spanish voicelines even), can enjoy the game too. Since Blizz will not offer an official Spanish server, what is your proposal otherwise?
---
Watching this sub lose its collective shit everu day is very entertaining
---
Very hard to believe with their track record.
---
That would suck for people who already took time off work for launch day
---
This is embarrassing.
---
Thanks leech!
---
Due to layering and fresh realms (everyone being in the wild leveling) quite low
---
Tyvm.
---
Wait what about the rant that you were gonna roll on their server and stick your dick in their virtual ass?! I kinda wanted to see that.
---
Cool, maybe the angst can stop and people just look forward to classic.
---
This sub is full of shills.
---
People who get offended over this shit are never gonna watch him anyway, all he is doing right now is satisfying his viewerbase by making you guys look like crybabies lol. You are the content buddy, enjoy.
---
No, nu-blizz doesn't know shit about what makes a game FUN. They are owned by activision now and all the OGs are gone (Metzen, Morrahime, etc.). The last great thing they did was WOTLK and even they managed to fuck that up.
---
That's cool. I hope they get sniped so much they have to move to PvE servers or better yet another game.
---
I don't think this is the hill to die on, man. The time zone is going to have no impact on your experience. Find a guild that raids at your preferred time and get on with it.
---
Lol sometimes it's fucking hot and sometimes I'm like... is this the same sandwich
---
idk for me it definitely comes from a specific dislike of sodapoppin and asmongold
---
I ran the stress test on a ryzen 2500u laptop with integrated graphics at 45-55 FPS
---
&gt; players are having greater difficulties finding people and grouping with friends in the layering system. And when I have the same problem, I figure it's time to complain.
---
This is 100% anecdotal. The fact is, I kept running into the same people during the beta *and* during the stress test, so I think you're another victim of the community over-dramatizing shit like always.
---
Sorry you had to learn it this way.
---
He literally doesn't care - and you shouldn't let it affect your enjoyment of the game. This guy streams while most NA players are at work/class, so it will hardly even have an impact on most of us.
---
This is very classy of you gents. 
---
I feel like the community’s reaction was overblown, but again, this is a very classy and professional way to manage that.
---
/slowclap
---
&gt;Don’t buy any skills after lvl 20 other than sinister strike and Evis to afford your mount at 40, pick up skinning and vender all leather aswell.
---
Dude...no don't do that
---
I definitely disagree with that one. Asmon has said he wants to be a scarab lord and he loves being the center of attention. If he rolls on the streamer server, he won’t be the focus.
---
I love how you admit that the community hates him, then says “but we’ll hate you more if you don’t listen to us”
---
Fun fact: never listen to haters. I guarantee asmon knows this. Saying “do this or we’ll hate you more” only emboldens him to tell you piss off.
---
&gt;Also stop saying blizzard pls
---
Alrighty mr. whiteknight.

In northshire abbey, elwynn forest, I get 90-95 fps on max settings on retail. On classic (with a lot more people around me) I got 200+

Hi, I am interested since your post checks a lot of the boxes I have been looking for. I am planning to play on either Faerlina or Herod, interested in Hunter, Rogue, or Warrior (pref tank, but I assume you are looking for fury which is fine too). I am definitely interested in weekend raiding, as efficiently as possible since I don't have an immense amount of free time these days. I have very little experience with vanilla content (didn't play much until TBC), but plenty of experience as a dedicated hardcore raider from WotLK through BFA.
---
\- By when are you expecting raiders to be level 60? I am only taking off 2 days at launch so I am not sure I could make the 2-week mark as a melee class.
---
\- Do you have any strict requirements as far as guild activities outside of raid times? Of course I expect to spend time farming. 3+ hours on weekdays sounds right, but I do have friends who play other games and I still want to dedicate some of my spare time to hanging out with them as well.
---
Let me know if I sound like a decent candidate for your guild. Thanks!
---
More anal and murloc jokes for me.

You think you do but they don’t.

Oceanic is still NA you can switch ingame via region tab.

August 26th 5pm cdt
---
That’s extremely cool of them to recognize that and leave Herod alone. Credit where credit is due.
---
Most product companies are quite clueless actually.
---
Nothing like being in a party and getting layered out so you can't play with your friends. You're a moron.
---
He won't say until the last minute but he will 100% play with Esfand and that lot, there all friends it would be dumb not to.

No it's not. Extrapolating how many people care enough about some pseudonym and are willing to reserve one for more money onto how many people in general want to try the game is terrible statistics.
---
How else would you know?
---
Im actually really hoping the streamers dont split  
---
Horde to Faerlina   
---
Alliance to Herod  
---
then there would be an inbalance.

But never the less we would bring them down much like any other player in HEROD!

It's not unreasonable and I thank you for sharing, but I personally am a little concerned that no similar quotes have been found about this stress test. I do now see it is possible that blizz did something similar for the stress test but I hope you understand if I've personally run out of "good faith" to trust them on this.
---
I have a feeling you either don't know what a community is or have never been a part of one. A community has nothing to do with being nice. There are a lot of toxic communities out there. So virtue signaling about how you're going to be nice for niceness' sake has nothing to do with layering or communities.
---
In queue means they will eventually play. So again no idea why you're bringing it up or even assuming there will be a queue as given. Just silly logical reasoning.
---
You're not playing WoW, you're playing WoW classic. There's a difference. There's a reason why you're even having a debate, not with just me but with others because the majority is against layering. There are a lot of people currently in the "I'm against layering, but it's a necessary evil for launch and blizzard promised to remove it" group. They are not pro layering like you and when blizzard doesn't remove it, which they won't, you'll see it's defense completely plummet because it's indefensible in terms of having a cohesive community.
---
Honestly the strawman you're creating about how you're for people playing the game is hilarious, but definitely silly.
---
"I don’t need a game to artificially create conditions where I will have a easier time making acquaintances" Another strawman. 
---
If you're just going to make up arguments for the other side to argue against, you don't need me for that.
---
How old are you btw? I personally don't think you've played any game that hasn't had auto matchmaking and insular communities which would indicate a pretty young age.
---
I mean, if they are too retarded to look at their own clock on their computer to make decisions based on time that's not my fault. I've never ever used the server time for any raiding decisions. It's always been by time zone. "we'll do this at 6pm est" not "we'll do this at 6pm server time". It makes ZERO fucking difference which fucking time they use anyways as long as everyone understands what time they need to show up. 
---
You gonna find 40 people in the exact same time zone for your raids? No, no you're fucking not. People are gonna be cst, pst, mst and est. There'es people who play EST but stay up until 5am, you think they give a fuck if their guild is on an eastern or pacific time? No, no they fucking don't, because when you stay up until 5am you can do either one.

My point exactly, and since the Lord of the Rings hype has all died down now Legolas is sure to be available.
---
Good job.
---
Doesn’t matter what motivates you as long as you live a healthier life.
---
Also i find playing on weed difficult, especially when a game is so demanding.
---
We don't know what server will have the highest pop. Expect them all to be high pop.
---
Orc is best PVE tank although some will vouch for Troll at very high levels. 
---
Mining and skinning will be a solid start, and you can swap skinning for something else at some point.
---
Layering should make questing sane enough on the first day - that's the whole point of the layers. So try questing and then grinding and if it's an absolute shit show then try exploring new zones as an absolute last resort.
---
FUCK! This was the server my guild said they were going to about an hour ago.
---
&gt; This definitely kills the hype.
---
The goal of this post is to kill the hype. It is willfully misleading.
---
Just pull up Asmongold's stream of the stress test and it's pretty easy to see that the layering limits on the servers right now are already very high and support multiple hundreds of people in the same place.
---
Wait why can’t you just put x? Can’t I do BridgeKillerx?
---
Check the "global release schedule" link. It's a global release on August 26th at 3pm PT which is August 27th everywhere east of the U.K.
---
I feel like he is just waiting to see if someone will give him his name on one of the 3 PvP realms.
---
If you've convinced yourself that blizzard is straight-up lying this whole discussion is pointless. The uncertainty between the two quotes can be attributed to the fact they're playing it by ear with how long to keep it online, probably depending on log-in rates.  But both quotes are clear that it's temporary and will be turned off.
---
But if you're convinced blizzard is evil and this is all a conspiracy to intentionally make this game bad so big bad company can laugh for being right, why are you even here?  Layering isn't perfect, blizzard isn't perfect, but attributing everything to malace is a crazy persecution complex.

There is a survey going, that is where those numbers come from (be aware that the people answering surveys now are not 1:1 with the population ultimately). 
---
PvE servers usually have a so-so faction balance. And when people start catching on that they are in the minority they might start choosing other servers, aggravating the imbalance.

Which is among the dumbest things he's ever said. As if hundreds of people weren't already going to be reserving his name on each server... right.

&lt;Heroism Not Included&gt; - Alliance, US-PvE (Pagle) - Casual/Semi-HC Raiding
---
&lt;Heroism Not Included&gt; is currently a small group of (mostly) BC through Cata raiders, with a couple of us having been around since Launch Day.  We’re looking to bolster our ranks ahead of Classic launch so we can hit the ground running with a few groups of folks to level together and grow into a solid raid team.  There is absolutely zero intention to push for world/region/server firsts at all -- we all have jobs, and can’t put in the kind of time we used to.  Our expectations for members can be summed up in the one sentence: "Act like an adult, don’t cheat, and think of the team first."
---
Focus/Schedule: Early on, obviously, will be leveling.  No one is expecting you to be 60 in a week (heck, even a month...) - you play at your pace.  Eventually we'll be raiding on Thursday and Friday nights from 8:00-11:00pm Eastern Time.  We intend to use EP/GP for raid loot.
---
Applying:  We're currently accepting all classes!  Please visit our website (heroismnotincluded.gamerlaunch.com) to read our Guild Charter and fill out our short application!  Feel free to reach out to me on Discord at Ral#5930 if you have any questions!

Classic WoW's dissenters has nothing on the Final Fantasy 7 remake crowd.
---
What a grade-A douche.
---
Where are you CST? I am Minnesota and my latency on PST is about as good as Eastern. PST makes more sense I think for us CST people. I wish they had a dedicated CST server though, even if it wasn't physically in Chicago or what have you.
---
Did that many times before, and just now for good measure. Seems like I'll maybe find out when the other flood gates open.
---
nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
---
Asmond rolling Faerlina would be perfect, it would balance out the population quite a bit.
---
It’s Hungarian, literally telling you to go suck blizzards dick.
---
He's not getting Asmongold unless Blizz lets him reserve early. That should be plainly obvious to anyone. Doing this doesn't help him accomplish that goal.
---
I'm still subscribed because I still fiddle in retail every now and then. Cant wait to end that shit.
---
Ahh thank you
---
I figured as much.  TY
---
Friends? This is what second accounts are for. :-P
---
Latency less that 3200ms...
---
Someone needs to modify the babelfish addon to not only translate between factions, but translate general chat too
---
im pretty sure the servers are the same as retail, so you can test those if you do some research
---
Imagine thinking $15x5 makes you a whale.
---
I mean I agree with him. The rest of us Subbed to reserve, and now this guy leaks this and fuck us right?
---
everyone come to herod - the peoples server
---
faerlina is the streamer server
---
I’ve never even played WOW before and I subbed to reserve my name! The hype is real
---
That is such a retarded thinking
---
you seem to care enough to reply my dude
---
The streamers were actually pretty cool to state what server they’re on so you can avoid it. They intentionally are avoiding Herod so people can have an authentic experience. 
---
Most streamers aren’t the problem, it’s their communities that follow them and treat them like gods
---
"In short, everyone is freaking out for no reason"
---
Sums up this sub for the past 9 months
---
Other way around, Horde cities and tribal culture better represent what a no-deal post Brexit UK might look like.
---
But I want to be Thex
---
I truly hope all mainstream streamers go to same server
---
Final Fantasy 14 is superior in a lot of ways to WoW. It's worth it.
---
Thanks, Esfand. Good playing with you today in the stress test IF event. I like watching your stream and hope you guys enjoy Faerlina.
---
You too hellige falk
---
Yet you still watch them and care enough to post:)
---
It’s important to remember that no one can ever say anything they don’t mean out of frustration in a heated moment. There’s 0% chance he wasn’t totally serious and not just emotional.
---
They should be dead for the first few months theres no point sticking around in them for the first few months. 
---
You will be finding people to group up with for dungeons in zone.
---
The only reason to go to town is bank and training since putting stuff on the AH now while everyone is broke is a waste of time and your only going to be selling to people playing the auction house
---
On a positive note their presence on alternate servers will provide a population boost and a quirky atmosphere that a lot of people will enjoy, whether or not some want to avoid it at all costs.
---
What...? Literally the only person in control of whether or not you see what they say is you....
---
Just wanted to reach out on behalf of &lt;Hillsbrad Heroes&gt;, and see if you might be interested in joining the &lt;HH&gt; family, being as it sounds like you might very well be a good fit for us, and us for you!

Find our basic info below, but also know that I’d be happy to send more info or answer any questions you might have.

In the meantime, encourage you to check out our website (in the below post) or DM  me on Discord (Server info also in below post)!
---
Luckily the cases blowing up on this reddit do seem edge-casey. My dad played all weekend and said he never noticed the layering. I suppose you're more likely to experience it when participating in specific world events - if you're just questing and doing dungeons on a standard basis i don't suspect you will notice much.
---
it would seem so..
---
The misunderstanding has nothing to do with viewer support though.
---
After playing LoL on EUNE I'm not so sure, KURWA REPORT AFTER GAME over and over does get boring really fast.
---
I don't know how common it's correct for WoW, but there's been shit tons of times where players are very right in their speculation of things. Although that's usually for things not pertaining to server and server management.
---
You are truly delusional if you think Blizzard actively does anything.  They are not going to ban anyone for using that feature.  As for sample size; I wrote one of the biggest gathering botbases for honorbuddy.  I had 100's of users who had 10+ bots a piece using the report function built into WoW that used data gathered via a tracking system.  They would report other bots, that were not flagged as safe, on their servers every time they saw them.  Not a single person got banned and they were all connected to the same database used for tracking other players/bots.
---
Even if they did, you will know their name/race/class and from there can easily /who and find them. Besides there is only a handful of places they'd be in any given zone.
---
They brought this on themselves
---
I wanted to know this too. I heard Shazzrah, mostly 👍
---
There are some poles living in the UK too
---
Do you often think people aren't allowed to have different opinions to your own?
---
It's 100% gonna happen that Classic's active player base nosedives in a few months.  I'm just interested in how high those numbers get to begin with.
---
I still think there's a chance this could be a "new beginning" for wow but it's not likely.  Classic's numbers would have to dwarf retail and sustain that over a year or so.  But it wouldn't ever be a "new beginning" ... best case they just re-launch expansions every 18 months or so.  And eventually they will get to Cata where the game's ruin was complete.
---
It literally isn't. Sharding is supposed to have you switching constantly. Entering new zones will swap you to a shard with others in that zone. Currently in a zone on a shard with 0 people? well there is a shard with 30 other peoples *switch*.
---
How is layering supposed to work? You get assigned to one when your character logs in and is supposed to *stay* in the layer always. The layer is over all of Azeroth and will contain the same charaters unless you(or other players) group up with someone in another layer or when they merge layers from populations starting to dwindle.
---
I seriously don't get how people can't understand how they are different.

STREAMER SERVER UPDATE - We recognize people will be playing Herod for an authentic Classic experience so we're going to be playing Faerlina. @Esfandtv @staysafewarlock @nickpolom @tipsoutbaby - Not sure where @Asmongold is playing.
---
📷Twitter
---
you can find that on his twitter
---
That’s false. Kel’Thuzad(his server) went from a horde dominated server to an overwhelming Alliance favored server in a matter of 2 years.
---
I really really hope he does so I can watch all of you manchildren babies on here rage. It's going to be fucking hilarious.
---
I just installed the game on my work PC. Seems easier xD
---
I'd say you are a bit higher up on the list.
---
Streamers on Faerlina and Brazilians in Thalnos.
---
####Can't wait for the long queues in Fairbanks, Herod and Whitemane.
---
And if they were on a different server or waiting in a 2 hr queue they also would not have experienced it.
---
What's more scary is the amount of people praising and agreeing with posts like these.
---
lol dude he's still wondering if you were talking about his classic music or not. you left him hanging dawg!
---
What you described doesn't address the issue that layering is meant to avoid at all. You literally just described what a server is, and then added in that every group of 5 will share naming rights. This still doesn't address the problem of population decline which will kill servers if they make more of them to accommodate launch, which is what you're suggesting. 
---
The reason people don't want more servers isn't because they don't want to have duplicate names if they get merged. They don't want more servers because server merges are awful. They mean that your community is dead or dying. They mean that there are so few people left in your community, that so many guilds have died, that you need to be huddled together with a bunch of other dead servers. It's the death of your community, the death of your server's uniqueness and history.
---
The fact that you don't even address this, while simultaneously, and pretentiously, acting like you figured something out that no one else was smart enough to comprehend is ridiculous. The fact that you think naming rights is what's at issue here is hilarious.
---
You have to be a moderator of the channel. If you'er talking about World, I doubt you were.

It's just a laser etched piece of plexigless that gives off a 3D optical illusion. There's actually a horde one as well.

That's really actually fair enough of them.
---
not working for me either
---
Where is OP promoting harrassment?
---
The sad thing is that no matter what server you play on, there will come a time when its raided by asmongold and his army of spergs.  And you won't be able to play for a day or two.  He even said on stream, and I quote: "well play on whatever server we want to.  Were going to ruin the game and it will be beautiful."  I feel like this should be seriously addressed by blizzard.
---
My ping to LA servers was average of 54ms
---
My ping to Chicago servers was 37ms
---
I'm assuming that won't be a noticeable difference
---
You sounded really bummed on Your stream about all the hate you guys been getting and I feel for ya but if Asmongold rolls anywhere other than the streamer server the hate is gonna come back around full circle.
---
Spread the word

Good to know. Good luck. :)
---
Even though english is taught in basically all european schools as a mandatory secondary language, outside of northern europe many barely speak it or try to avoid using it if possible (either due to lazyness, national pride or simply lack of interest). People are scared that a chunk of their server community will have problems communicating (or refuse to communicate altogether) in english. It's not a problem with the spanish community in itself (I'm italian and we also have a bad rep when it comes to speaking english, same with germans and frenchies technically but they get their own servers). The problem is that language barriers can lead to a lot of shitty situations and fracture a server community which is a big deal in WoW vanilla (one of the main reasons a lot of people prefer vanilla to retail WoW). 
---
IMO it's mainly fearmongering as any group that tried to ignore english speakers and do its own thing would simply isolate itself into irrelevance but we'll see I suppose.

My 2 month old daughter has her own bedroom at my in laws place haha

Final Fantasy 14 is about, and solely about the MSQ. Comparing it to WoW is apples and oranges.
---
I still don't understand.  Why is Herod "the authentic experience?"  Isn't it arbitrary?  Why couldn't any of the others jus the the authentic experience?  In other words, why did the streamers have to move?
---
Warrior, 3 fire mages and one paladin.

The main problem is holding agro off the healer. If you have a priest, it will die.

That's just an idiot who's trying to divide the community for his own benefits. He seeks to engage the streamers server to stream himself and make more money. He is not talking for our latin community
---
Wow. You didn't even bother to read the first line of my thread, did you? Global chat WAS in Classic: /LookingForGroup was a GLOBAL channel added toward the end of Vanilla. What I'm wondering is if /world will have a 50 player cap like player-created channels had back in Vanilla since that is the channel everyone who played the beta / stress tests seem to use.
---
And no, people will not be forced to go to a capital city to spam trade to fill groups. Actually read the OP and don't just reply to the title, please.
---
If the population still requires layering at the end of phase 1 they'll probably open be realms, add queues, and offer free transfers.
---
He hangs out with Mcconnell and Esfand constantly, there is 0% chance he will be playing on a different server than them.
---
Harrassment ****
---
His name was sniped the moment he became e-famous. That's not an excuse.
---
lol what? nobody has to be my opinion, it's op that says blizzards is some sord of god entity that can never do wrong. but hey, keep going with ur mindset.
---
&gt; Only reason he knew there was one, was because he saw people flying to it and he was determined to find it.
---
That's how you game.  I don't need no steenkin' guide!
---
Retail isn't about the leveling process from level 1 anymore. It's about getting to the latest expansion quickly, and *then* playing the new content, and gearing up for endgame.
---
The game evolved into what it needs to be to stay relevant with the new expansions.
---
Vanilla was a completely different mindset. Which many people enjoyed, and hence it's back. But judging retail by the portion of the game that is super intentionally easy and designed to take way less time isn't comparing apples and oranges.
---
No... you drew a comparison between planned server merges and layering. How is it that you heard my response as a comparison between "system" vs. "no system"?
---
Don't play at all. Don't burn out at all.
---
I'm CST going Herod rather be behind an hour than ahead 2. Also way better ping from anywhere CST to Chicago than all the way to the west coast. Would make sense for MST though.
---
So is this kind of racism going to be the norm un classic?
---
just get a few ribs removed like marilyn manson
---
Sorry to let you know, but the cost of each material is about 8s, and you need to have 9 skillups in enchanting before making it, so sadly it isn't an option until you outleveled level 5
---
Well if you bought bfa you get a free 110 boost but otherwise i’d recommend leveling a character and just doing a few arenas here and there.
---
pet battles, mounts, farm a wow token, pvp, watch youtube classic videos amd make posts here
---
Lmao, that's Esfand merch. Make Azeroth Great Again.
---
Of all these groups announcing their servers, I'm expecting one of them to be an elaborate troll job.  Hoping you guys stuck to your word.  Keep up the good work!
---
LOL can't argue against statistical science. Chill out man, don't get so worked up. Something tells me you always have to have the last word on everything so I'll let you have it!
---
I think the amount of players trying to sell them the names or just reserving for them is going to beat the number of players trying to just steal.
---
"Normal" players couldn't care less and are just worried about their own names... aren't you?
---
But then i'd get frostbite on my mouth and I don't want that.
---
FOR THE PEOPLE!
---
Diablo 3 was a massive success. Its literally a top 10 selling game of all time.
---
Towelliee is a fucking dickhead.
---
See you there, friend!
---
As far as I know, your 'layer' is assigned on login. It's kinda hard to make that vanish when you enter a city. I do wish there was maybe less dead layers. But the system will likely flesh out when there's A LOT more player base.
---
&gt; Southshore is under attack, general talks about the invading raid, but you are sitting in a peaceful Southshore layer.
---
Based on what people are saying on this subreddit, that doesn't happen? There's a post elsewhere here that general chat is per-layer, which means that you can't have that experience. Is that post incorrect?
---
I've never made a rant post on Reddit before now, but almost every sub is having issues with 'mob' abuse these days, so it really pissed me off seeing that it's happening here too
---
Hold your breath!
---
Tab cycles targets
---
Most people are basing this over modern Blizzards track record which on top of the evidence really doesn't show that Blizzard knows what is best. Sharding is still very broken on live after YEARS with mobs spawning in and out or teleporting to shards with 1 vs 50 faction ratios. Even on a logistics level many people have explained how layering simply won't work in the long term but Blizzard refuses to talk about that.
---
Your solution of letting Blizzard handle it only makes things worse. If people are wrong and Blizzard makes it work perfectly everything is fine but if you dismiss all the problems and just hope Blizzards fixes it you have the potential for those problems to be real. We should be bringing up these concerns to Blizzard especially when they haven't commented on the big problems people bring up.
---
Even if layering works off what Blizzard has said there is still huge issues with the system and this type of response is just horrible for coming to a solution.
---
You clearly haven't viewed the forums regularly in the last 5-7 years if you think it's 'victim blaming'
---
*shuffles deck*
---
They slightly changed the model of this rabbit in Dun Morogh. This confirms a cash shop in classic.
---
You must not have been on an unbalanced or low population classic server.
---
So you clearly didn’t understand the reasoning for layering or grasping a straws. Try actually playing, leveling, and questing with that many people in the same zones and see how well that works for you.
---
I don't believe so. But maybe someone who knows more can chime in.

Lol I remember I asked him how he knew where he was going, and as I did that someone riding a wyvern flew overhead and he goes, "Thats how... they keep going this way" great memories.
---
You’re not getting it. Claiming that technical stuff being tested in a stress test is speculation is like claiming that a game being tested in a beta is speculation. Now, that’s just what it is. 
---
The speculation is that launch will be a disaster. And that’s pointless to work oneself up over speculation based on poor evidence. Make no mistake, a stress test is poor evidence.
---
🚨 SAY IT AGAIN FOR THOSE IN THE BACK 🚨
---
Layering sucks, but it does make sense because of the various issues that classic face, particularly all the tourists, so I'm willing to grin and bear it for a while but should classic be more popular than they expect, they really, really need to open up more servers quickly, particularly for eu. 2 English pvp servers just isn't enough
---
Yeah, sure, I expect that. I'm just hoping for a bit less of the wannabe-machismo expressed through ancient video games.
---
Honestly my bad. I thought you were the person messaging me on another thread about whales.

What you said is actually a very good idea.
---
Imagine ever having respect for Asmongold.
---
Easier to add servers than remove.
---
I wish people understood this more
---
Additional layers are more cost effective than additional servers.
---
Could you imagine if Asmon rolls Alliance on Herod?
---
Fun thing i did in retail wow is i made a priest and you can spam shadow word pain and it kills everything so fast its stupid
---
Ok ok... 2 hours of bgs? Nothing else i said was untrue you guys are HUNGRY
---
Nah, your post got removed because it's a poor attempt at shit flinging. Instead of engaging people about layering you're just stoking the flames. Sincerely fuck off.

I guessed so, but, since I didn't experience any issues, I'm not sure which statement was sarcasm.

Both him and that mcconnel dude he plays with talk about that they voted for trump, so I'm pretty sure they're just actual morons.

What server do y’all recommend for someone who is starting out at streaming just for fun? Should I play on the streamer server and be overshadowed or the non-streamer server where, if I grow, I risk ruining the immersion for others?
---
What a jerk.
---
At least I have access to my feelings.
---
You sound like an Everquest player talking about WoW when it was released in 04.
---
Times change.  BFA and whatever expansion afterwards will have way more people playing than Classic.
---
I say this as someone who started playing in 05, and who's quit BFA to play Classic.
---
Hard is relative.  Rotations and gameplay in Classic can be called easy in comparison to rotations and gameplay (M+/Mythic raids/Rated PvP) in BFA.
---
Classic, imo, isn't about easy vs hard, there are other things that change the game way more than how many mobs you can pull and live.

Nothing carries over. I thought he was asking what to do in retail to kill time.
---
Feels like a ruse because realistically they should want the biggest server for future recruitment etc. If people avoid their server like they know people will, it's terrible for them long term so they announce one and actually pick the other.
---
And let's be real, they wanted Herod and still do. I am expecting a bait and switch here.
---
Looking like Menasor out here.

---
Ha I ur right.
---
Yes, that's what happens when you piggy back a sale on one of the most beloved franchises ever. You could also release warcraft 4, it could literally be a game that BSOD's every computer, and they'd still likely have 10M+ pre orders.
---
Another example of massive 3M+ sales despite overwhemingly negative reviews (at launch) was no mans sky.
---
In other words that game was a huge commercial success due to hype and pre orders. The game has not maintained players and is more or less on life support while other ARPG's (POE/GD) are growing, and it's for a reason. 
---
&gt;Don't you guys have phones?
---
/ah shit here we go again meme
---
Riot games has a whole different subset of problems within their communities too that they don't handle well. 
---
I personally agree and would love for more dev&lt;-&gt;community level feedback. My problem is the community at large is shit imho. The loudest voices often declare themselves the speaker of all or superiority and it's wildly inaccurate.
---
So if you take Tailoring, you are probably able to make your 1st green it (shirt) by this time as well. Which gets you items to disenchant and gets you those skill ups as well as most of the mats you might need.
---
You can then check the merchants for any missing reagents and then find a Blacksmith for the rod. All easily done by level 5.
---
Thats good to hear then :)
---
No they dont I know the most because of my emotions.
---
PvP is a good excuse to make friends along the way really. Nothing like bonding with a stranger over a common enemy heheh. And unlike retail if you ask for help in chat people will actually come and help you so getting hopelessly corpse camped is not as common as you would think outisde of underpopulated zones.  
---
That's how Stranglethorn Vale and Tarren Mill became such legendaries "warfare" zones back in the day. They are the first contested zones many people will reach and always quite populated which leads to hilarious feuding between factions starting from a single gank and escalating into full blown WW2. 
---
That said you WILL get ganked, corpse camped and harassed so if it's something that really grinds your gears you're better off playing PvE; I'm sure at least one of the PvE serve will have a healthy population. Hell I bet some hardcore PvE guilds will roll there to avoid getting ganked with their world buffs on on their way to raiding so it might even be the best choice if you're exclusively interested in instanced content.
---
sharding is different to layering.
---
tab is BIS. also having in combat health bars show above their heads if helpful.
---
Some guildies wanted to transfer from our small dead realm to a high pop server for raiding and chose Illidan-US. I joined them blindly, and I... was not prepared...

ITT: Every one assuming layering is going to behave exactly as it did during the stress test and beta.

How many player in January 2020?

In the EU, where there are almost as many different languages as there are countries, it is not ridiculous at all.

No... what you want to see it that it has an actual graphics card... Many Notebooks (even more expensive ones) come with on-board graphics which are often called HD INTEL Graphics...

make sure to actually have a graphics card... at last one of these

So you manage to farm 50+ cloth for level 10 on a fresh server with people tagging humanoids, or getting about 7 greens in the wild? 
---
I respect the point you're trying to make, it is valid, and I should probably edit the OP that this isn't advice inteded for the masses, but to the ones who wanted, specifically, to get the wand at level 5 :) I would believe most people would get a kick out of simply having zero down time for drinking ever with the wand more than anything
---
With Soda and the big streamers announcing they're going Faerlina group of guys will be shooting themselves in the feet if they try to claim Faerlina
---
I didn't say I could plan better than them. 
---
Don't put words in my mouth.
---
I simply said I don't trust them after the shitshow that has been retail wow for a while now.
---
I don't think there's a ton of people subbing to reserve names. I don't think this will give them any more info than the stress test did. If you're going to sub for name reservation, why not sub 4 days early and play the game a bit.
---
Brazilians will still be a minority in that server. 
---
Remember most players just join a server because the name is cool or whatever. 
---
They have no idea who picked what and why.
---
Mainly thanks to players constantly asking/complaining about difficulty and QoL.
---
 Mixed with some really, really, really bad design decissions.
---
No one single choice is responsible, and i’ll be the first to admit that some of the choices i loathe now i applauded on release (flying mounts, dungeon finder).
---
That’s why i hope they release new expansions on classic instead of going the same route.
---
Imagine the possibilities. WoW can become the dark souls of MMOs.
---
taking longer doesn't mean it's more difficult
---
ANd they are right =D
---
Need to say it. Blizzard better be checking things like Battle.net traffic. I am that guy who has unsubbed for a couple of years but regularly rolls with two accounts. I haven’t been able to get into beta since I don’t have an active account. I don’t need to resub for name reservations, I’ll make new names.
---
Unfortunately I lean more towards me knowing Blizzard better than they do. They are the ones who ignore test realm feedback then fix something two years later. I wouldn’t be surprised if they completely underestimate classic demand.
---
My only goals at this point are to make sure I pick a data center physically closer to me, and that I don’t end up on the same server as a streamer with a thousand zombified followers.
---
I swore by that sandwich until I tried the chick fil a spicy deluxe. It's just different class for fast food spicy chicken. 
---
Pity about their shitty politics but I figure my money eventually ends up with shitty people almost no matter what I buy so fuck it.
---
I've noticed a climbing population of these arrogant posters. Seems like the steamer crowd tbh.
---
They said that in an interview from May right before beta started. They said that this is the process. Name reservations&gt; sees the numbers and will open a number of servers according to it. The numbers will be there so there will be servers opened for sure. Many players will get lvl 60 in a week. Maybe even faster with layering. They will have enough time to farm. They won\`t get contested on farming spots. There will be a lot of items. Many people won\`t know about farming spots so don\`t expect every level 38 to farm fire in Arathi. And what will happen after layering is removed. Suddenly you can\`t farm as well anymore. Who abused farming pre-layering will have a big advantage economically. The ones that get to 60 quicker will have a huge advantage over the ones that take like a month to get to 60. They won\`t get the same type of farming potential post-layering.
---
There were little to no guides back then. You kinda just figured shit out. I was in a high-end raiding guild doing server firsts and we were the one's often writing the guides or sharing info (to other Horde guilds only).
---
Do you have any ideas of what you want?
---
Heh... Quick fix he says
---
They are tweaking the numbers right now. It will be fine :,-)
---
Yes..
---
 But if you tested on 1 account that's not a real test.
---
Oh hell yeah.
---
I played on Horde Ravenholdt. The RP tag, for myself and many others, was just to scare away kids and those with names like Ilikebiggbutts or XxArthasxX
---
We admit it all the time. You know what Blizzard could do? BE OPEN WITH THE COMMUNITY AND SHARE THEIR INFORMATION/IDEAS/INTENTIONS.
---
If you look at that video and take it 100% at face value, you are an idiot.
---
How Did he get there? ;)
---
then stop wasting peoples time and dont play it at all...
---
ill delete my comment actually giving tips...you are unworthy...
---
He's a react streamer that can't produce content of his own.
---
There's no fucking way he passes up on the free content, views and money.
---
Lets not forget he cries when his view count drops below a still stupidly high number ~6k.
---
Dwarf Priest is the only real way of Denying fear in the game.
---
Even if the class was awful it would still be good for that one reason.
---
It's a proxy.  Better than nothing, from Blizzard's point of view - and if they get a ginormous amount of name reservations for some particular region-server-type combo, they may decide to add more servers of that type before launch.
---
But for sure the real numbers a month after launch will be far more important.
---
Mods are gunna leave this post to let you embarrass yourself lol.
---
Sorry first post got deleted for some stupid reason
---
Dude you should apply to Method, no one in the history of WoW has ever had that easy of a time leveling. You must be some kind of savant.
---
i was chuckling at the amount of people who said they plan to be 60 in 2-4 weeks, and the number of people saying they plan to play 1-2 or 3-4 hours a day.
---
When it's ready
---
You were in a RP guild on a PVP server. Of course the RPPVP server is going to be closes to your 2004-2005 experience. That doesn't make it true for everyone.
---
I give it like a 90% chance he rolls with Esfand and crew, but Asmon's also the type of dude who would announce Herod (or possibly take it as far as logging in there Day 1) for the reaction, even if he's going Fae.
---
Wish i was tinandris :’(
---
It's not unprecedented at all. It is very in line with private servers over the last 5 years.  
---
It will swing back the other way as the more casual fans less likely to be on forums and taking surveys one month out come in at launch, but how much it is hard to say.  
---
Many entirely PvE focused guilds will roll on PvP just for the larger depth of raiders though, just like they did in vanilla. If this catches on a lot in Classic you may want to rethink PvE if you are keen to see AQ40/Naxx.
---
Same dont need to read about how a gnome is climbing into a dwarfs asshole or whatever rp they do nowadays
---
Great video.
---
I do think people are blowing things a little out of proportion though. Unless you're trying to reserve a very common handle, or something from popular pop culture, I'm betting you'll be fine.
---
Can I ask what the appeal of being on the server with streamers is? I'm just trying to understand, not knocking your choice!
---
That was my plan too along with the guild I'm in. Then the streamers had to give a big fuck you to us. We'll probably just go to Herod, then.
---
In retail you just hit the buttons the game tells you to without ever losing health or mana.  In classic at least you get active choices over whether to cast again, or wait for the 5 second rule to kick in, or run, or whatever.
---
Limited resources make you choose what to spend those resources on.  That's a key component vs retail where you just hit your rotation and punch the keys that light up.

---
Interested in a laid back guild but still organized enough to complete raid content? Interested in unleashing viking-esque PvP strats on alliance scum? Interested in hanging out with thick-skinned, quick-witted, big-brained, dad bods??
---
Well, here at Dad Bods, we are a semi-hardcore raiding and PvP guild planning on raiding, world PvP, bg premades, and just hanging out in azeroth. Our main goal is to have and provide the best community experience a guild can offer. We are a laid back group of guys and gals, and a good number of us are real life friends in north california (we host irl events so we can be closer as a community!). Our guild is primarily age 25-35 but, looking for all!
---
**Philosophy:**
---
The only thing worth taking seriously, is our freedom for unadulterated fun.
---
Interested in raiding? 
---
Interested in PvP?
---
Interested in just chillin?
---
Don't let us or any guild define your fun - instead, let us provide you with the family to have fun with.
---
Your friendship with us extends beyond the maps of Azeroth. 
---
**Raiding Info**
---
Time: Tuesday and Thursday 8-11 PM PST . We want raiders to be prepared at the instance at 8 PM PST.

Yeah but what was his decision? Would be suck a dick for his name? Asking for a friend.

Lol no, this does come from a very specific loathing of Sodapoppin.

He’s a spoiled entitled manchild that cries when he doesn’t get what he wants. Fuck him and anyone who willingly associates and promotes him.
---
For sure. I guess I didn't even consider the fact that they're probably watching those stream(er)s. It'd be pretty easy to track down at that point.
---
Still wouldn't be surprised if people try it though.
---
Taking the high road here.  Can only respect that.

Literally read my post, I said or did nothing offensive.

Holy shit I never knew that carbot made a WoW series. I used to watch all of his Starcraft videos

Yes, that is what I am doing.

I love you &lt;3 bless rng your way!
---
Dude, you're shit got reported, other shit didn't or went to chiller mods.
---
Get over your self.
---
Will do :^)
---
Even if he does go Herod I personally wouldn't care because I'm playing Alliance on Whitemane.
---
"avoid streamers" is the best thing I've ever seen. Had a good laugh at Asmon's impact listed as "EXTREMELY HIGH"
---
&gt; all the walmark shooters
---
Hey man, those players are going to Whitemane. And for what it's worth, I don't know of any NA player that dislikes Latin American players and every time I have played with one it's been nothing but good experiences. Brazilian players on the other hand seem to be fairly toxic most of the time.
---
Like they knew back when they originally launched the game?
---
Not at all, but you can believe what you like.
---
Now names free up after they have been inactive for 2 expansions. The rules for classic names are not the same as returning retail
---
&gt; HEROD is going to be overpupulated and there will be big queues, since all the anti streamers and Xenophobics are going there (all the walmark shooters).
---
Where did you hear that? I was under the impression most of those types were headed to Whitemane?
---
I played a troll shaman, I love this.
---
Exactly my thoughts
---
It's gonna be an awful release like every other expansion and you'll eat your words.
---
Blizzard know more than we do? They think they do, but they don't.
---
I didn’t.
---
They have 11 servers launching instead of two, so if there are 5.5x as many players then its break even. The stress test was also a window where you have to play it then but when the game launches, you have until the servers are shut down to play. The urgency will surely be there for the first week as everyone rushes in for release, but that will disappear within a week or two. If not, they can add more servers which they said they are prepared to do.
---
Yeah, Faerlina showed so much promise! 50/50 on horde and alliance split and lower population on the census, no one was talking about it anywhere, not a strong name so naturally people won’t flood it, etc.
---
Was hoping for refuge there from the overpopulated Herod server and BR Thalnos.
---
Herod welcomes you with open arms and a great community to grow with!
---
Yeah, that's what it looks like now.
---
I’ll be joining you.
---
Don’t wanna join a streamer server but ill roll a rogue just to fuck with streamers and their fans
---
There's no guilt in that. That's what moderation is meant for. /thumbsup
---
Unless you have massive amounts of fans following you around I wouldn't worry about it.
---
any proof of it being sharding other than you not knowing the difference?
---
Hahahahaha
---
&gt; with a fake ass girlfriend
---
Huh?
---
I resubbed two months ago without knowing release date.   I now have 3 more 90s
---
I would suggest looking for a guild raiding off hours in 
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/wow-classic/wow-classic-guild-recruitment
---
or maybe try NA servers since the only cost is a month of sub and nothing except CE pets (and friends) carry over anyway. i would also have trouble settling on one server unless i had friends on one region.
---
Layering doesn't stop you from not making it out of the starting zone. It's literally meant to be the same as a server. So a server would have the same affect. 
---
Anyway if they keep layering for a very short time, 1-2 weeks, fine. But Phase 1 is predicted to last 6 months, during which time a majority of players will play the game and make friends communities etc. 
---
If they keep layering in its current state in an extended from, they will kill this, just as it is dead in retail.
---
If someone takes my lame name I wouldnt be mad I'd be curious as to why they picked such a dumb name.
---
Grow up will you?
---
Heyyy us canadians are people too you know
---
That's really cool of you guys to talk with the community and take that into count for your choice of server. 
---
Respect.
---
Sounds like a /ignore would do the trick
---
Paul okenfold - ready steady go

I completely agree and i would like to add that Classic wow would have never existed if it wasnt for a very vocal minority.

Grobbulus shaping up to be the Boomer server
---
Having been on and off 4chan since the early 2000s, my opinion is that they're barely a thing these days.  
---
And trolling general chat is like adding water to more water, it'll get lost in a sea of no one giving a shit
---
Hey I can see my toon in this clip! What an awesome night, can't wait for Hillsbrad the first weekend after launch. Labor day is going to be a bloodbath
---
Thanks for your comment.  Has blizz said what their magic number is or what will happen if p2 rolls around and there are servers with many more active players than they expected?  Would realm transfers be offered in theory?
---
He's alliance.
---
Please don't try to turn it in to the new burning legion-EU, It sucked having to change from the realmI playing on since vanilla because nobody could/would speak english...
---
4chan has a minuscule impact on realms. If you've ever played on a popular private realm, chances are there has been a 4chan guild and you never even noticed it.
---
Will find out after launch
---
whoa, this is awesome! :O ty
---
Get this to the top!
---
Play warlock. Not playing the one class you want to play because another friend you have has demanded that class. Is a really dumb choice.
---
Hahahaha
---
Not really. FF14 already does it and it works surprisingly well. Seamless integration between PC/Xbox/PS4 players.
---
How many players play on Vanilla Private servers? Nost/Elesium were the most popular, but there were many more other private servers out there. I'm sure the majority of them will remain active and a fair number of players returning that did not want to touch private servers for various reasons.
---
Something is really odd about this. As a swede myself, I've never had someone ask me if I'm swedish. *On the other hand* my childhood friend whose also swedish have had plenty of danes asking him "danske?".
---
It will be what it ends up being on each server

[Get this asap](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5462/dartols-rod-of-transformation) it'll change your entire outlook on how the game is meant to be played.
---
From what i understand, the Brazilian community has claimed Thalnos as their "home".
---
First, it will be open until launch, so unless you want to name your character "Jeff" you shouldn't have much trouble waiting a few hours to reserve your name.
---
Also, in regards to the time it's opening up, it's a compromise for NA and EU while also being an okay time for most of asia/oceania
---
It's the middle of the night like 00:00 in EU, and I need to get up 5 hours later.
---
Seeking a PVE guild. I plan on maining a Druid; would prefer to play Feral (Bear), but I'm willing to start as Resto with the desired endstate being a go-to offtank for 20 and 40 man content.
---
I'm flexible on server choice and faction. I've played and raided as both Horde (Resto Sham through BWL and ZG/AQ20) and Alliance (Prot Warrior through MC, Ony, and ZG/AQ20).
---
NA/CST, limited during the week but very flexible on the weekends. I'm an adult looking for other mature adults/like minded players.
---
Please reply or message if I can help you guys out!
---
I'm not in a hurry.  I want a game world that is interesting, with mechanics I enjoy, and that I can wander around doing whatever it is I feel like doing.  That's Classic for me.  It's a time sink that I know I had fun doing, that I will do until it is no longer a source of fun.
---
Except it is working like that, and there have been plenty of examples. You can keep saying 'they're testing', but we've heard that before. If Blizz wanted to quell these fears they could just make a Blue post saying that. But they haven't.
---
The sad truth is that right now it's working like sharding. That could change. But we can only base on what we've seen.
---
Soda is just as bad if not worse than Asmon.
---
If I may nitpick you said it was a stat stick for hunters but hunters can't be maces.
---
I had a toon with æ in the name, and a GM forced me to rename it. I had it for a while though, so either somebody reported it or a GM saw it randomly.
---
Oh hey I dont buy games from those companies either.
---
I don't see streamer followers as being any different to Everquest guilds or Something Awful forumites or any other external group entering WoW, personally. They can do what they like, it mostly doesn't affect anyone else.
---
I am debating between rogue and mage. I know that both of these jobs are actually pretty good at PvP in the right hands, those hands just haven't been mine in the past. With a career and kiddos, I know that trying to learn how to PvP properly and leveling to raid later on simultaneously will be very difficult, so that is why I lean away from the PvP servers.
---
There is a maintenance in18 ish so im guessing after that
---
Layering is continent-wide, if it was zone-wide that would be sharding and both the players and blizzard agree sharding is awful. The entire idea of layering is once people have spread out through the world you can just turn it off completely.

---
And what would this reason be
---
Fuck man. There were more than enough people that never even reached 60 until TBC released. 3 months with casual play after work is pretty damn reasonable.
---
Yea they wouldn't lie to anyone that would never happen....
---
For real though Wendy's spicy nugs are back today.
---
It's more a PSA about what you can expect the culture of the server to be, if 4chan will be spearheading a movement on it.
---
In either case there are large numbers of toxic followers with all streamers.
---
&gt;There are more options then you are listing. Including number 1, communication.
---
They could clearly communicate that they understand our concerns over layering and they will remove it asap. Not by end of Phase 1, or a few months. But asap.
---
In an ideal world, yes. We don't live in an ideal world though. People will rage at them no matter what they say, which is the entire reason Blizzard doesn't communicate as much now as they used to.
---
&gt;They could increase layer sizes. They could make new layers taking people away from their current one less often. They could make layers that are permanent and listed at login, like most other MMOs. Then you pick your layer and if you switch you are on a 30 minute cooldown. Then they merge layers as pop. drops.
---
Layers are already the size of an original vanilla server so making them even bigger would be a huge change. Layers area also already going to dynamically merge as population drops.
---
&gt;but maybe compensate by temporarily buffing respawns in 1-6 zones for the first 3 weeks
---
Blizzard already talked about respawns being dynamic, just like they were in vanilla.

Asmon was not joking in that clip though, he is the kind of person to join another server just out of spite.

all 3 servers are gonna have hundreds of thousands of players. there's nothing to worry about in terms of low pop lmao
---
I couldn't disagree with you more. Leveling up 2 characters to 5 JUST to get a wand at level 5 JUST to min max that character is pointless.
---
I've been doing the traditional farm 50ish cloth and level tailoring and get lesser magic wand at level 11ish over and over again.
---
Both on fresh pservers AND the stress test allows to collect this cloth easily, in the right areas. You can also beg people for cloth by trading them something. Farm linen in the troggs in DM or loch modan.

Straight up circular way of min maxing, this post had so much bad.

I agree with you, I play FFXIV on PC but I use the controller support when fishing and stuff. It would be interesting to see WoW go more mainstream and being more accessible to people who refuse to play on a PC.

Sure, blizzard may know more technically. But look what it does: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ)
---
Well no, I knew he was a manchild. I just didn't think he was a *spiteful* manchild.
---
I think PVE will see a ton of casual players, who are less hardcore are less likely to take part in surveys like these.
---
I’m more annoyed because I work 3pm-12am so I’m going to have to be at work right when it happens then get the leftover names at 12.
---
It was basically just a way to force the streamers hand because they refused to commit to a server, so the people who wanted to avoid them chose one instead, ending the stalemate. The blacklist thing was mainly just to show them they were serious about their decision. Highly doubt that shit would have worked in practice.

You sound like [Donald Rumsfeld.](https://youtu.be/NXbCwq4ewBU?t=85).
---
For me, playing for 6 months-2 years with my prefered name is worth the 30 min of work the sub costs. Different strokes for different folks
---
This was a super legit move of you. Thank you for doing this. It sucks you guys get hate, it's mostly the people who shit up the chats that are getting the hate and you can't control them. 
---
I was really nervous about this and you hooked it up.
---
Appreciate you announcing early, and with consideration to the majority non-streamers
---
I have no experience with them, only what I've gathered here. Are they also several thousand people across several guilds? And as others have suggested their choice might be a faint because people are actively avoiding them it seems. If they're as notorious as people make them out to be that sounds about right up their alley.
---
You are a true gentleman and a scholar, I hope Asmon follows and does the right thing with you guys as well, as others have said this isn't out of hate for you guys (I'm an EsFan), it's just the need to have a vanilla-like server.  Much love bros for doing this before the name reservations.
---
It says the name contains mature language. You can only put X at the beginning of the name.
---
Misdirection. They have already all reserved on faerlina.
---
Yes. I work for Big Monitor and think everyone should have multiple.
---
" gotta say I'd rather wait 20 mins " Congrats you have no life or job. The rest of us do. Well take the layering in phase one.
---
Uh, what? There will be so many people levelling at launch it will be insane. People are not going to be like “where is the community” when their layer has 100 people in the zone. They would certainly be like “wtf” if they had a 10,000 person queue or had to wait for 1 spawn point with 10 people each all fighting over the tag on every single boar in the zone.
---
I'm surprised Golemagg doesn't have a "Is so chad that he gets to guard Ragnaros' personal window" one.
---
Cause the servers have a chance of being spammed by their followers. I don't think it'll be a big issue. It takes HOURS to level up even to level 10 for the average player. You're looking at like 8 to 10 hours for level 15.  
---
Most of the people just joining to jump around with asmongold in Northshire are going to be left out when their bedtime is up and he levels all night with no hopes for them to catch up.
---
They're also afraid they'll break the economy a bit, to which I say there are tens of thousands of other players on that server so it's not going to be a big deal at all. One person can't break a server economy. 
---
Idk, I don't think the bad things are as bad as others say they will be. I think the positives far outweigh the negatives. High pop and lots of events are cool.
---
Honestly, Blizzard should have just caved and given these streamers early name reservation. I don't care if it seems preferential...just look at this damned subreddit this past week. It's been on high anxiety stress alert. Why? Because of names. Simple. Had the streamer's known they were getting their names 100% this would have cleared itself up days ago.
---
Dude you post about this shit in every thread you're in. We get it - you're left wing. That's fine. Go away now.

It's not him, it's his army of pleb tweens. That's the problem, and why everyone wants to avoid their server.
---
Thank you dude. We appreciate as a community those of you who took this step.
---
and you wonder why
---
&gt; people that don’t even try to understand his personality

then go on to say

&gt; He enjoys trolling ...

&gt; ...and riling them up ...

---
How is it not clear to you why people dont care to understand him? hes a 1 dimensional clown who attracts the equivalent of fortnite kids as viewers.  there is nothing significant to understand and something painfully obvious to avoid for most of the demographic that is going to be playing classic.
---
Prepare to be corpse camped whenever you stream.

I'm surprised this is an NA exclusive issue. What is with EU streamers?

I know what kind of person he is.  It's how he built his streaming persona.  He's not being entirely sincere in that video, he is playing it up for his community and for the vocal anti-streamer group.  He's saying he doesn't really care, which is true and in-line with his narcissism, but he's not going to reroll.  When he says he's going to ruin the server and everything is about him, it's hyperbole.  Part of it plays to narcissism and part of it plays to the anti-streamer crowd.  He's fueling the fire and bringing the conversation back to him.
---
He's made a career out of this, part of what he's doing is a persona (though he's always been a pretty terrible person), but I don't know how you could listen to what he's saying and take it all at face value.
---
I'm not saying they're not, but you don't get to call it "The Authentic Classic Experience" by blacklisting streamers, then be fine with those things. This is going to be no where near "authentic" and everyone needs to understand that. Streamers are going to have just as much impact on their servers as giant private cliques will on theirs.
---
My wife and I logged in new characters, at the same time, and couldn’t see each other. I invited her to a group and she layered into view. This happened again later in the day when we logged back in.

I've always loved Thunder Bluff! :)
---
How did you get the 8 raids into the SAME layer?
---
I always liked seeing posts saying blizz needed to have more servers, or anything to do with population.
---
Blizz has literally done stress tests and has exact data on their max expected concurrent players, as well as access to current subscribers. Data we have no idea other than speculation about.
---
Only blizzard know how many people they can put on a server, how many they can put on a layer, and how many layers they can have.
---
Your going to need to move all the lego sets. Where else are the 50 empty soda cans and stacks of dirty bowls going to go?
---
Be good regardless of the class you pick. A shitty (insert class here) is VERY easy to spot in Vanilla/Classic wow. If you are good, you will get a raid spot.
---
Dual monitor master race. It 100% makes the difference from not having to alt-tab.
---
lol, it's not about gatekeeping, it's about people having the decency to speak the language of the server in public chat. I don't expect anyone to get banned, but at least you can get them silenced if they are too lazy to set up their own channel.
---
&gt;large number of toxic followers with all streamers
---
You got me. 10/10
---
Which was part of the thread regarding “respect”
---
Too much matching
---
said this in another thread and people weren't keen on the idea, they hyperbolically likened it to gulags lol. I personally think it's the best possible solution.
---
So? Many things in this world haven’t directly affected me but I still care. Do you really only care about things directly affecting you?

[A][EU][PVP] Warlock 
---
Good day all, I am Welbz and I am looking for a raiding guild.
---
Background:
---
Played retail through most expansions, raided in vanilla till C'thun and some bosses in Naxx. Further raided in TBC/WotLK/MoP/WoD/Legion/BfA.
---
Next to playing retail, I played on LH/LB and cleared untill AQ40 including C'thun.
---
Times to raid, I prefer to play from 21.00 till 24.00/00.30. Sooner is possible too but not ideal due to work commitments.
---
Got questions, hit me up on Discord, flesho#0166 or here on Reddit.
---
So this is the now updated plan for the streamers? Faerlina?
---
The community is not about the number of people, it's about the consistency of those people.
---
You must believe!!! Dick will prevail!
---
&gt;there is no reason to believe otherwise
---
RAISE YOUR WEAPONS, GROBBERS!
---
&gt; There are pretty obviously too few servers for launch
---
We have no data to support this claim though. We have no idea how many people will be long term players, while Blizzard certainly has some market research on this topic.
---
My wife would have gotten halfway and then Decided the game is too boring if I have to travel like that.
---
Layering has nothing to do with server capacity or launch? What?
---
No, the loophole is that Texas categorizes Twitch streaming as a different form of work compared to other states. So while they should be taxed for a certain amount of money they’re gaining from their “job”, they aren’t. (All of this info was found on Reddit, I have no idea if this is 100% true but there’s a lot of evidence for it).
---
En bedankt he...
---
This comment needs to go higher
---
YOU THINK YOU DO BUT YOU DON'T
---
&gt;Blizzard has said layering will last for phase 1 only
---
So the entire leveling experience will take place in a diluted world where it doesn't matter if a zone is getting raided by Horde/Alliance when you can just get an invite to a quiet layer. Getting corpse camped? No problem. On our new and improved layered servers, you can just get an invite to a different layer. Problem solved. Here's your watered down swill.
---
This sub is now: streamer hate, repeated memes, and shameless advertising.
---
The game just isn't designed to have more people in the world though, otherwise they wouldn't bother with the layering and just have everyone together from the start. Have you played on one of the vanilla private servers with like 12k players online? Things get overcrowded as hell. All the "no changes!" stuff that this community has been going on and on about for two years now? Increasing the amount of players out in the world would be a serious violation of that and would have pretty serious effects.
---
This is incredible, thanks.

I mowed several of the neighbors lawns for $15 a week for a long time and then bought it with my own money. It was like $800 or something from Costco. I was so proud lol. The resolution was the worst even at the time but I didn't know any better. I just knew it was big.

**🔷🔷 &lt;ASCENDANCE&gt;🔷🔷** **EU | Alliance | Shazzrah PvP Server**
---
**Region**: Europe
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Server**: Shazzrah - PvP
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
**About us:**
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success.
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
**Raid Roster needs:**
---
* Druids: *Backup\**
---
* Hunters: *Backup\**
---
* Mages: *Backup\**
---
* Paladins: *Backup\**
---
* Priest: *Backup\**
---
* Rogues: *Backup\**
---
* Warlocks: *Backup\**
---
* Warriors: *Backup\**
---
***\*Backup***
---
We currently have our 40-man roster full and a few backups. However, we have experienced significant changes across the months we had in the guild already. Not to mention, we expect drop-offs while leveling. So, roster changes are bound to happen.
---
**What we expect**:
---
* You to play your class well and have knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
* We do not expect our members to spend exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid, but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions, bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM).
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)
---
We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it’s important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.

Define "we"
---
Theres also no guarantees that the servers we have arent sufficient.
---
I was also an OG ravenholdt player, and moved on to VeCo and Emerald Dream over time. I've never actually roleplayed. But being polite, friendly, and speaking in complete sentences was enough to get me by.
---
anything but asmonbald
---
Was gonna say that xD
---
I'm going to roll on a non streamer server for my main but I might level a rogue or hunter as an alt on a streamer server after.
---
I was planning to avoid the unofficial Spanish realm, but that's basically impossible in the EU with only 2 PvP servers.
---
I thought Zandalari was the only RP-PVP server?
---
If go pve
---
layering AHAHAHAHAHA
---
True, but the atlernative is Herod, which is arguably going to be full pop and longest ques! You have Thalnos, but they have the BR and spanish, and Whitemane is West Coast, sadly. Fairbanks doesn't look too bad I guess?
---
The only chance that dude actually gets thex is if some redditor gets it first and then coordinates with him to give it to him.
---
just got back to the states from a week in Berlin! What a city!!
---
I completely agree with everything you said, but the dropoff will already be real and if people couldn't even get online in the first place we'd be even worse off. Blizzard is doing this because just to use round numbers if you're talking 50% of 100k people quitting (with layering) or 25% of 60k people (with no layering but massive queues preventing people from logging on, and a large amount of people just giving up entirely) the first option is going to win out every time.
---
Class move here, thank you all
---
For LAUNCH. LAUNCH. That is why I said obviously. Sharding, layering, dynamic respawns, merging, etc. are all solutions for an overpopulated LAUNCH and are not talking about long term players.
---
Once again, not a pointless comment since with Classic specifically it's going to be a much larger number of people that fall into this category
---
Also as the only NA RPPvP realm, though the in game cycle runs on Pacific time, I doubt anyone will find problems with finding a community with the same schedule
---
I wouldnt go that far, but I also wouldnt punish streamers by limiting them. They should have every intention of being on the same server. Not doing that would be a loss for them since there is content to be made with streamer v streamer duels/ organized world battles/ pve races.
---
Worst case, just wait and see where they go. Nbd.
---
19 inch CRT monitor and around 20 fps on average was my wow experience. 10/10 Would play again.
---
Mother-knows-better
---
and again, that does not affect you.
---
Very petty, like I said in another post the person that will take assmongole name will have a fucking terrible time playing the game. Same goes for any other streamers name.

Your comment didn't really have a point. It's not "pretty simple" and you may very well be "forced" into playing on a server. Herod won't have enough room for everyone, so some people will HAVE to go to faerlina even if it's not their first choice. 
---
Them wanting to play the game really isn't remotely relevant. We're talking about cumstains who float around ideas like creating cross-faction blacklists for people who kill them... on a pvp server. If they "just want to play the game too", they are free to do so. Just don't stream it while doing so. Pretty fucking simple, right?
---
Hi, I'm a Vanilla raid tank who was in MC (on farm) and BLW, and AQ20. Then TBC dropped and ruined my guild's ability to finish the progression. So my primary goal is doing just that.
---
I don't care if it's at a slower pace, as long as it's with like minded people who want to take raiding seriously and do well.
---
I would consider an Offtanking spot, if consideration is given to let me tank sometimes. Otherwise, just being real, I'm likely to keep my eye out for an actual tanking position. 
---
I'm very reliable and I expect everyone to have the same requirements--no freeloaders.
---
I plan to first level up a hunter alt, to take advantage of early game resources.  I expect that character will be 60 in 10-11 days, and I will be working on my warrior on the side, taking advantage of rested XP.
---
I could not care less about pvp on my warrior. Though I may make a 19 WSG toon, or roll a rogue on a streamer server, to gank streamers. Not sure yet.
---
Please PM if you would like to chat and we can interview each other, thanks.
---
As if it was always like that... dont forget that a lot of the very vocal people, playing on pervers, are the ones responsible for blizzard starting this all.
---
This was sad to read lol.. this post might actually be proof that classic is going to fail
---
Legions of twitch spergs.
---
My thoughts as someone who also has played OSRS extensively is that you need to set your own goals in the game. Much like OSRS; Classic seems to be about making decisions based off of how you want to play. Don't let friends force you into picking a faction, class, or even professions. Find what you enjoy to do and become the fucking god of that in Classic. You can always make an alt to play with your friends while focusing on your main. Just my two cents.
---
Don't feel like going into a big writeup, but there are pros and cons of going streamer server.  It's more of a risk for sure and it's not worth it to me if I'm not a big fanboy.  I'll go the safe route and try to have a nice clean classic experience.  Overall I don't think it'll be of an issue as people are saying, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.
---
@Khornate858 I saw that video, and other scummy moves that streamers have done, but I still stand by my claim that the "majority" of people just wanna enjoy classic and don't really care about streamers and their personalities. We just wanna play the game we love.
---
I empathize with the "hate streamer" talk - I don't wanna be anywhere near them and I don't watch them. I think we just want to enjoy vanilla WoW separate from them.
---
I understand why they have layering but they are fucking themselves because they have so few servers, if they allow 20-30k players to roll on a server it's not gonna work if 12-13k keep playing. They should have hard caps for servers so they don't end up with 50k players on a server which forces them to keep layering or they will have 10h que's.
---
Maybe I'm just paranoid but it seems like they are going to force layering on people by putting too many players on a server and then claim that removing layering is impossible because of too high population.
---
Oh. I think there will be plenty of obnoxious hardcore guilds on each server
---
If people don’t care to try to understand him or his humor then that’s okay, but dont act surprised when the guy known for trolling starts trolling again. 
---
Also, if more people knew he was just trolling instead of thinking he’s actually going to try to ruin the game, maybe they wouldn’t think “streamers are the evil boogeyman coming to kill my favorite game” like some kind of cringe version of the Red Scare
---
Its been my pleasure, thanks!
---
Point Of personal priviledge here...
---
These colors are a but too aggressive and may make some other comrades uncomfortable. I suggest a palette of the usual communism grayscale shades.
---
That being said, you'll be totally, 100% fine on a PvE server.  A LOT of people will be playing there.  Hell, retail WoW doesn't even have PvP servers anymore, so you see where the majority of people (that aren't vocal) actually want to play.
---
Hard work to buy something that makes you happy is always something to be proud of.

You don’t though. Thinking that you do is delusional.
---
Only if there's a difference between supply and demand. Some items may feel even more rare or be more valuable because the pool of people wanting them is bigger. 
---
If there were 5 of an item before, and 500 who wanted it out of a pool of 3000, and you scale up, that should just be 50 of an item split among 5000 in a pool of 30000. A very different situation than other farming, since random drops will be less abusable than Lotus and Devilsaur. 
---
There's sadly just not an easy way to make safely replicate how it was.
---
The purpose of the stress test was to test layering, so that’s sort of why people were looking for problems with layering.
---
So good
---
Blizzard is fucking retarded. I don't have a single bit of trust for their trash company.
---
how do you know? Not accusing, I've heard this a few times, and just want to know a source
---
On the other hand, a 15 year old game still having a few million subscribers is pretty damn good.
---
That’s missing the true classic experience though
---
Yeah it’s because after he says “we’re gonna fuck the server” to spite the concern they become pretty easy to hate

Blizzard also knows that there will be ALOT of interest in vanilla WoW that will COMPLETELY dissipate around level 30-40 grind. I can get to level 60 in normal WoW in no time at all, maybe 3 days of fun playing (less than 10 hours a day). It’s going to take over 7 in game days (7*24) for me to reach 35 as I intend to run instanced, and a full gnomeregan.

Guaranteed in two months classic WoW will have less than 1/3 of the starting players. Some will give up, some will buy gold and get banned (that first mount) and some will demand a refund because the game is too hard.
---
TLDR buy it with real money or spend the retail wow tokens to get game time. thats it.
---
You're completely missing the point. Layering is happening, regardless of your complaints, and as such it is pointless to complain about layering at this point since we're 2 weeks out from launch and there is no way layering is going anywhere. In no way did I say talking about issues is pointless or has been pointless since the start of the Classic's development.
---
IDK who you are but I really appreciate you taking the time to go out of your way to make sure you "wake" of followers are not an issue that limits our Authentic experience. You are cool peoples for doing this and I hope others recognize this too.
---
Thank you from some random.

I'm going to walk over to the window and use remote desktop to reserve my char name.  That'll take about 2 minutes and I'll go back to work, aka browsing reddit in my downtime.

He's just stirring up drama because it's good for his channel. Of course he's going with the other streamers. It'd be fucking retarded for him not to.

I did 1 paladin 1 priest and 3 mages.. switched to 2 priests and 3 mages after and it was...glorious in AV.

Tips is horde
---
With moderns technologies like Virtualization and Containers Blizzard can most likely start a new server in a matter of seconds. Also their server tech probably scale really well now with sharding and all. They most likely could have a single megaserver and split players into different shards like elder scrolls online does. But we do not want that so they have to be conservative on the number of servers and try to guess how many servers they are going to need in the long run, when sharding is removed. The other solution would be merging servers or adding cross-realm later but we do not want that either so they don't have many choices left.
---
ikr? nerds lul

This is the narrative every time, and every time it's pretty much what we thought it was going to be.

Nothing to feel stupid about. It just happens like that. As a 10+ year plus habitual weed smoker, I found myself setting at a gathering for a football game, paranoid and out of my communication comfort zone. I learned in that moment that the way I interact with the world and the people around me is no longer suitable for keeping a weed habit, and I never looked back from that day. I just quit.

You can grab the name for your main char and sell the other 2 on the black market.

Could have left the group in order to escape to another layer

Check the classic forums. They have a link to where you can find your old guildies from 04 to 07 i believe

What is a "classic wow launcher"?
---
Are you launching from the battle.net launcher or the wow.exe directly?
---
You should be able to log in right now, if you have a sub.
---
Hopped in to suggest Three Houses, lo and behold.  
---
For real tho that's my recommendation, in addition to any RL stuff you need to get taken care of.
---
Your example would be apt if that kid with the nice bucket threatened to kick everyone he doesn't like off the beach.
---
Funny you'd leave that out. I don't give a shit about what Soda has and whatbI don't. 
---
I just want to camp entitled assholes.
---
I don't think your shitty false equivalency accounted for that bud.
---
Yeah, you're the victim. I'll call the waah-mbulance for you.
---
IIRC the 1-5 quests are race locked but once you leave the starter zone it's open to all.
---
Who did he mean by "them" though?   He said he would talk to them.   I imagine he means the people in his guild, right?
---
Mine was the same until I rralized I put my email in wrong. Lately the same for you
---
If your layer doesn't have many people, it makes finding groups for things like dungeons (which already have a tank/healer shortage as it is) much harder.
---
What people and how do you know the server population before hand? I have no idea.
---
If we're going to be literal, the OP also lists in what ways Blizzard knows more than the playerbase, and those on the list are inarguable.
---
&gt; Herod won't have enough room for everyone, so some people will HAVE to go to faerlina even if it's not their first choice. 
---
Why would they HAVE to go there?  There are 2 other unclaimed PvP servers...
---
Each layer population is 3k - the same as a Vanilla server.
---
Good on you for at least taking it for what it was and re-evaluating your opinion. More than a friend of mine proved capable of sadly : \[ I enjoyed a stream night or two of Sodas as well before this came out, dear lord was i astonished and surprised. Sadly a lot of ppl will excuse it away with all sorts of irrational notions.

Is this the case? I actually do really need to know this.

It's on the front page of this subreddit dude.  Learn to read.
---
Depends on your definition of a classic experience.  If you want to enjoy the competition and PVP, Herod is for you.  If you want to enjoy the quests and the world, a PVE server may be more appropriate especially since you've never played wow before.
---
Howdy! Glad you think so.  We'll be announcing our home server at a later time. Feel free to drop by discord for more information.

Yup that's specifically why I played RP server

You're not even going to tell us the name? C'mon, man. You can trust us.

at this moment it is only 1 skeleton person on the floor. there is no offical word whether its a bug or not. IIRC vanilla wow had almost no limit per person.

LOL wot, my time converter failed me. I must have done something incorrect.
---
don’t do me like this
---
But who is "they"?   I take that to mean his guild, not the other streamers.   Why would he talk to the other streamers?  He wouldn't.   That makes no sense.
---
Is the name thex?
---
My Boss doesn't know what World of Warcraft is
---
&gt; So you're saying that the game will be ruined by something you don't even notice?
---
Absolutely! My fondest memories of vanilla aren't efficiently questing in the barrens. I think we can all agree on an objective level the quests in wow are low entertainment value. It's social experiences. Bumping into and fighting that gnome that killed you 2 days ago. Grouping with some guys for a dungeon then running into them in a quest area the next day, grouping up again, and clowning around. If you are imperceptibly shifting layers and changing who you can and can't see and who does and doesn't exist in the community it becomes much harder to make friends and enemies alike. Vanilla wow is a social game and fracturing the community into tons of layers they move in and out of ruins the community aspect.
---
The community aspect has been slowly eroded away by good intentioned decisions that seem like a net positive, but ultimately end up making the game dumb. Things like cross realm battlegrounds seemed great. Dramatically improved the pool of people in the queue, stopped stack stomping. Yeah sure you don't see the same people, yeah sure you're not teaming up with the same people you trade, raid, and chat with. Sure they're now just sort of faceless randoms from other realms you won't see again. Who cares I get to PvP. Ok now theres cross realm dungeons, dungeon finder. It goes on and on until suddenly you sign onto wow and you realize you're just idley sitting in the capital waiting for raid night and actually don't know anyone aside from a handful of people from your guild and aren't having fun anymore.
---
Don't, go play something else. I'm playing these games I own that I may not see again for a few years.
---
That's true, sometimes the Classic community gets freaked out over every little thing.  But then again, Blizz was the one that gave us "You Think You do, But You Don't".  Anyways, if you want to relive Classic, you should go in blindly, not knowing what to expect, and hyped, rather than be hypercritical of it
---
I am right there with you man
---
Naw.
---
Instead of being a sissy, go in when the encounter is red on your quest log, and you'll actually have to think of defensive and offensive ways to win.
---
Or, you would wait until you're 50 and then run RFD on easy mode.  I've seen a lot of that, not good.
---
Not just that he is delusional... That he fervently believes he as a streamer has a right to dictate how others play the game, wanting the ability to ban others etc. It's a huge lapse in character and i genuinely can't say i have the slightest respect for him after hearing it.

 What EU realm is the best for me if i like casual playing both PVE and PVP ?

I am failing to understand that.

You just press whatever button is bound to shadowbolt, release it to start the cast and when the need arises, you right-click into nowhere, hold down the right mouse button and move your mouse to follow the moving target.
---
Check this guide out: http://wow.allakhazam.com/wiki/Mouse_Turning_Guide_%28WoW%29
---
Not just that but imagine 50k followers trying to earn brownie points with their streamer by camping resources to give to them, world bosses... anything shared that they might want becomes increasingly difficult for you to farm yourself.

All of my buddies that are joining want to play PvP so unfortunately PvE is off the table for me
---
Go look at the poll data which is the literal first post in this sub.  Then scroll down about 5 posts and read the thread about Soda's tweet which conceded the Herod server to non-streamers.
---
Just read.
---
It's less resource intensive to maintain multiple layers on one server than it is to maintain that many layers as separate servers.
---
Think of it like cooking dinner. 5 people each making their own meal takes a lot longer than one person cooking for 5 people.
---
It isn't every day I get to report the same post twice!
---
They're legitimately my lifefuel so I understand that completely.
---
I think with systems like this, if they give players too much information, there is more room for exploits.
---
You know Afrasiabi has had a self-inserted NPC since Vanilla. "Field Marshall Afrasiabi" in Stormwind
---
I think they handled it in the most logical and clear way possible: it being two weeks prior to launch, at the same time as the global release will be. That being said, I am also at work for a 12 hour shift.
---
It's not removed in the slightest, did you play vanilla on a large server? Guilds were far more of dickheads than just ganking and fixing the economy of servers. This is falling right in line with an actual classic experience.  
---
I mean a dude ninja looted something in MC when invited to another guilds run one single time and that entire guild was camped until they stopped logging on those characters. They couldn't leave stormwind without someone on alliance telling someone on horde over teamspeak where they were.  
---
It was fantastic.
---
Eagan’s the goat
---
Well pretty easy. If they think all their retail kiddos are going to pop in for two months and then quit (which seems like blizz does, what with only 4 servers for NA)
---
So we will have 15-25k on each realm with 10-15 layers, except most players will not get past lvl 40 (cause WoW is so hardcore etc everyone will go back to retail). 
---
So those who do hit 60 will have 15 layers to bounce around to. Mine a vein, get buddy to inv. Mine another one without even moving, leave, have another buddy invite. Etc etc. 
---
Maybe even less than 10g per bar to be honest.
---
Oh shit you mean original Team USA lol? Like before the game had any thoughts of esports with like uhhhh supcutie and zombify?
---
Will do my best - What server? 
---
For real tho if you think it's going to get taken, i can reserve it for you and delete once you're available.
---
Azeroth auto pilot is the best I think.  It is ready for classic up till level 30 I believe.
---
HUMONGOUS LEFFEN
---
Sharding creates a false sense of density by bringing people across different realms/servers into one area to deal with UNDERPOPULATION.
---
It's one of the main problems with retail.  There is no real community because you're essentially encountering random people from random servers who you have an enormously small chance of randomly encountering again.
---
Layering is almost an INVERSE of sharding, and meant to deal with OVERPOPULATION.  Only people on your server will be on your server and the only people that will ever be in a layer with anyone else from the swrver.  The idea is if the entire instance of Azeroth (it could be more localized, I'm not sure) on the server is over say ...1000 people (again, this number is certainly wrong, I'm just using a nice round number) then a layer is formed, 500 people each, and there are now two instances of Azeroth on YOUR server.  This is ONLY to deal with the initial surge of so many people being on a server all at once at launch and while the game is in early hype.  As the amount of concurrent users drops, which it certainly will, the need to manage server load by splitting off layers will be eliminated.
---
Of course it is possible, whether you hate yourself at the end of it or not is a different thing entirely.
---
or each of you wanan go on a different server type :/ or faction
---
There is no TBC.
---
Why is cancelaura after frostbolt cast?  Why doesnt polymorph macro have an focus target?
---
These macros need some help.  They don't even have cast Rank 1 spells for Frostbolt.
---
gl with that. Hope you're not too attached to your account. Detection has come quite a way in 14 years.
---
Yeah, that clip is definitely taken out of context though I get why it concerns people. I've watched asmongold a good bit. I have no issues against him personally or him as a content creator, it's the spergs that follow him that I've made a goal of avoiding. If you've ever watched Asmon before, he trolls like this a lot and he was probably mocking a post on reddit and responding to it in that manner. If I had to guess. I don't think he intentionally wants to fuck up anyone else's experience however he strongly feels like he has just as much right to whatever server he chooses as anyone else does, despite what that might mean for anyone else.
---
Hopefully bliss bans you
---
Both.
---
Well now we know where the Ooga gang is rolling!
---
I have another small tip: Load into classic now, enter your account name, and click 'remember account name'. It will be saved even though you can't actually log in yet. Not a big deal, but it might save off a couple seconds if you're going for a crazy popular name. 
---
Also for any other old folks like me who haven't played in forever, your account name is now your email address. Might want to make sure you remember your password too and don't just have it saved in the launcher. Good luck everyone!
---
Ah okay thats good to know! Cheers :)
---
Mostly their entourage, creating a playerbase that is only (hyperbole) interested in memeing out with their favorite streamer and not participating "normally" with the server population.

I have no first hand experience.

Going Herod. Just confirmed.

Yeah, not being able to play the game? The best. Having to sit in a 3 hour queue just to get in is fuckin' awesome amirite

I was playing a night elf for old times sake this morning and I completely forgot it rained liked that in Teldrassil
---
You were the salty one with your previous comment, mind you. I haven't played on Nostalrius although I sometimes regret that seeing the many screenshots. Back in Vanilla whatever month you'd like to take there were quirks, world server downs and things that didn't work right. If you do a massive start there are going to be problems regardles, I'd much rather prefer that being some mob spawning problems than the obvious layering problems we've seen. Lets call it personal preference. Seems you rather want a sleek singleplayer experience than a quirky MMO experience, mr. angry
---
I am hesitating to do the same. But I have IRL friends joining who would not be able to play in English, unfortunately.
---
Well, for the Brazilians. Last I read Spanish speakers *were* aiming for that realm.

Yes but there are more bad than good players. That it\`s in every game. For every trader there is like 100 potential victims. 8k more people means 80 traders and 8000 victims. Don\`t take my numbers for granted just giving an example. We don\`t know at the end of the day what will happen. That\`s why the idea of layer is bad. Just brings a lot of variables in play that we don\`t even know what effects they may have. We know at least what happened when there was no layering in vanilla.
---
Absolutely want to optimize for leveling as a warrior
---
This is the same Blizzard that said years ago "You think you do, but you don't" to Classic WoW servers.  So I will just leave it at that and their data.
---
Also the same Blizzard that had the data of their falling subscriber numbers since Cataclysm due to terrible game design decisions like this one.  However they of course had data that showed their micro transaction profits were going up.  So sure Blizzard has data, but their criteria is not in line with players desires.
---
People are wary because of how Activision-Blizzard has handled every release since, and including, Starcraft 2. 
---
It's completely fair for people to be skeptical and not buy into this "Blizzard knows more than you," drivel because of their track record across multiple projects (not just BfA).
---
Yes, your talents while leveling will matter.  Certain talents will even be better or worse depending how you level.
---

Launching it through the battle.net launcher (with the correct account selected) should log you in automatically.

It's really twitch shadow-president Mcconnel pulling all the strings from behind his puppet master curtain, but yeah, he's definitely drawing it out for content.

Funny how people talk about streamer entitlement yet feel entitled to be able to play on a server without streamers.
---
Thanks papa &lt;3
---
I certainly did not. I was given the old vanilla title screen and prompted to add my credentials... not sure what others' experiences are
---
Asmon also said a bit before that he wasn't worried that he'll get his name, with a little smirk. It makes me think he got it reserved for him by Blizzard, which would be fine. Blizzard should have reserved their names last week and then announced it, so we could have at least avoided that much drama.

Where are the alliance UK boys going?!
---
Uh...trolling much...
---
Else name your streamer friend.
---
This brought to you and part by: my butt
---
You've made up the argument that more than 3,000 people need to be in a single zone in order for layering to be a problem. Just about absolutely no one agrees with that logic, which is why the argument doesn't work.
---
Thex on multiple servers
---
On retail yes as well as when the League of legends servers were Weat coast I was at 90ish ping as well
---
This survey is cool and all, but yeah it's probably 1% of the player base
---
I gave my old account to a buddy, no idea what he did with it. Time for a fresh start!
---
Blizzard rejected my credit card three times, but I got through. I imagine I ignored the cosmic warning signs... god I’m so pumped
---
All twink level groups were good in their respective ways. I loved my 19 priest, but think I preferred my 39 Paladin.
---
Too hardcore, I only have 2 open atm and a 3rd minimized.
---
Imagine someone writing the sentence "i grew up with" and then insert name of someone who has no tangible skills or contribution to society, but that sat in their room all day playing games while lonely men tipped them as they do strippers.
---
I guess it went over their heads lol thanks man
---
I don't care about him one way or the other. I would rather not play on his realm. Him claiming Faerlina is deflection.
---
That is BS, my friends and I waited on the server screen and they turned green
---
why not just have multiple windows lul
---
do you need to restart client for them to show up as online?
---
nou
---
I was following until you went into full-retard mode rabbiting on about Trump.
---
Right on brother. I don't miss the days of playing with BR people during WotLK/Cata. Getting them in my random dungeon and inspecting them and seeing at max level they have 0 talent points spent. Or intellect mail as a hunter.
---
Not for me.
---
No you both
---
I was getting 60ms on the Pacific test servers from New York.
---
The question is, do we wait on this screen and they will be joinable? Or do we re-log when they go live
---
Get in Shazzrah friend!
---
take your time so i can take your name =)
---
&gt; He says he likes to have a separate button to cancel Ice Block, so I guess the idea here is that you can do that without using another keybind?
---
I suppose that is good to have, but a cold snap / iceblock button I found invaluable.  You can just mash the crap out of it and it handles both.
---
&gt; Also, focus target wasn't in vanilla
---
We are on Legion client and API, it should work.  (Not tested though).  I appreciate the effort but it seems like lowkey, give me youtube clicks, click bait.
---
Agreed it just makes a lot more classes viable to twink lower brackets there are to many hunters and rogues.
---
RP-PvP is a lot more about taking the world at face value, yes, from your character's perspective. That means if murderhobos keep showing up one after the other (regardless of whether it looks like the same one over and over again) who want to kill you and hump your corpse, you keep fighting and killing them over and over again.
---
If the death mechanics of the game/world are "immersion breaking" to you, fine, ignore them and explain it away after the fact, that's on you. "You went down over and over and kept getting back up again to fight just as many times" is fine by me as an explanation. It is not fine by me to get destroyed in PvP by enemies who won't play pretend with you, and respond with "well I'm just going to call the GM to ban them then."
---
This is literally no different than telling your GM in an actual tabletop game "no, that didn't happen, that doesn't make sense to me, change it." when he tells you a magical respawning clown turns up and keeps attacking your party. It's not on you to decide what does and doesn't happen, it's on you to decide how your character responds to it. "I make a ticket to get the guy banned"  isn't a valid option. The world is happening, you are in it, deal with it. 
---
If you lack the imagination (not intended as an insult, some people just can't) to explain away some of the more obviously gamey mechanics in the game and need to pretend they don't exist to feel immersed, for the love of god, do yourself a favour and just roll on RP. I personally believe it defeats the point of an MMORPG, but if that's your preference then don't feel like you HAVE to go RP-PvP for the true experience, it sounds like it's not for you.
---
The whole point of RP-PvP is that non-consensual PvP can happen, if you only want "surprise PvP but with your consent and until you withdraw it" go play on PvE and turn your PvP flag on. There you go, problem solved, best of both worlds as far as your concerned. Am I missing anything?
---
Alright, at least that’s one server down. I got tow accounts so I’ll try two diff servers and hope I get lucky lol
---
I said I did that already. They don't work either.
---
Crying myself to sleep each night
---
I mean, your analogy is stretching things pretty far. There's only opportunity cost lost by the people below. They're not toiling miserably, they're enjoying themselves. It only incidentally benefits goblins and has the benefit of increasing the supply, reducing the price. So while these goblins may make more gold, it matters less to the average player if an item is still more affordable. It's a bit of a win-win. The only problem is for goblins not fast enough to catch the initial gravy train will have a harder time catching up.

---
The only reason we have this coming out is because enough people told blizzard they were wrong.  They said we dont actually want classic, remember?
---
I have never heard anybody wanting layering/phasing.
---
Pretty sure name reservation will be up until launch, so you can just delete it a week from now and make your character then when people aren't testing names.
---
So far stress testers have said it does and it doesn't. I guess you can try your luck.
---
You can reserve it and remake it at a later date.
---
I am going to take my time and make my character proper. My name isn't common, and if it is taken, I'll take another.
---
Got plenty to use!
---
You will never figure out my name being Thex..
---
New York is relatively close to me. Where are the servers in Pacific, and are they the same for all Pacific realms?
---
It will last until level 40 is that for every server?Some of our group might not be even playing for that long
---
It's not, but you can login and create a character to reserve a name for your toon.
---
but your name says you agree with me
---
It’s Channel 9 in Australia.  For those who live here, we say “Of course it’s staged.”

---
&gt; Layering program attempts to divide playerbase into "optimal" numbers - so that questing is still possible, yet the world feels alive.
---
Here is the main problem with this premise:
---
1. Layering in the form of "sharding" or "cross-realm zones" in retail WoW is what killed many realm communities especially World PVP
---
2. Layering creates an incoherent world where all of the sudden defending "Goldshire" thats under attack from a competing PvP realm guild doesn't matter, because oh its in one of many layers.
---
3.  Classic WoW for majority of players was desired because of this very loss of realm community.  To sacrifice this very element for the sake of "optimal questing" ruins the main reason many wanted vanilla servers.
---
Yeah, attention whoring.
---
I'm trying damn hard to avoid streamers!
---
Why would I slow down my internet for Lower chances
---
Wow.. I want to live there.
---
good luck my dude
---
  The quote I've heard that best explains it is Reddit is full of dumb people pretending to be smart and 4chan is a bunch of smart people pretending to be idiots.
---
Esfand, I'm a 31 year old male, I like most of your content, it's upsetting to me that I won't be joining  whatever server you're planning to roll on, I'm maining pally too. It is only due to your majority audience of 11 year old fanboys that would suck your dick for a shout out. It is in no way nothing to do with you as a person, I actually like your persona, I just want classic to be as I remember it. But yeah, keep at it brah
---
most of them said on forums and social media that they wouldn't play on a spanish one either, because server would die in a month or so...
---
That's a terrible analogy. 
---
A better one is:
---
I want to do NASCAR (Dungeon). I am giving an option between a NASCAR stock car (warrior), or a Honda Civic (Paladin). While the Honda Civic (not to pick on the Civic) can get on the track and race well enough, it will be smoked by the NASCAR stock car ***every time.***
---
Your pit crew has the option to join who they want and they want to win games (the Dungeon). If they have the choice of car, why would they ever pick the Honda Civic when they can pick the NASCAR? 
---
The Paladin tank class does worse in almost every aspect of tanking ***except*** for AoE tanking. And even then it's barely better than the other classes.
---
It's not incorrect to have an opinion that server merges are worse than layering.

So will it just go green or do you have to re-log tk see the servers available ?
---
No, you can have my upvote
---
Mine is not to game at all. Spend time with friends and family. Ill also exercise a lot.
---
I'm pretty sure that's what happened.  If you watch the full clip he joined a party with someone in Tirisfal Glades.  Then when he zones into Org the shift to the party leader layer happens.  It's not ideal, but the logic behind making layering smooth is complicated and there will always be some problems.  Hopefully they work out the kinks or limit layers as much as possible.
---
The Irish exit
---
I mean thats what you guys are spamming here, that you dont watch streams. And you definitely dont, or you are blatantly lying about not recognizing stream sniping. If you are in stealth and the guy knows exactly your location and the zone you are its pretty fuckin obvious, shouldnt be rocket science, but i guess it is for some.
---
Because if it worked for you, it didn't NOT work for other people?
---
It works, except when it doesn't. It's not 100%.
---
Well then I want the outdated and old server technology from 2004, which made for a better experience.
---
They certainly have a much more intimate understanding of tax evasion.
---
Anyone going with Fairbanks or Whitemane? I can't decide which.
---
PVP west has been untouched by any international groups, streamers, and pretty much any attention whatsoever. Though we recently found out 4chan will be congregating in Whitemane. Not sure of what kind of impact this will have. Might be better to just go with the low-key best realm, Fairbanks?
---
It being Friday druid doesn't mean we live in an alternate universe. The context was using a feral druid in the MT group vs hunter rogue group (and the rogue not getting WF then).  I was saying i would ratehr just have a feral druid tank in the regular tank group for the crit % it provides the warrior tanks. (Unless you need 4+ tanks or some shit)
---
i know that what you say makes total sense and i even agree to some extent, but vanilla wow had epic player retention when it was live - I don't think we can just automatically assume a significant amount of the playerbase will just abandon it within the first phase or whatever,  the game is just as good as ever
---
If you think layering is going to get in the way of grouping and playing with your friends, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how layering works.
---
Me too.  I’m just sitting back and watching the chaos.  I’m pve or maybe RP.
---
Good plan!
---
I mean what's stopping him from going to another server in the 2 weeks before launch. I'm going Herod personally
---
have they ever communicated or give a hint at that? have they ever mentioned the possibility of adding new servers? i'd love to get a source on that.
---
&gt;m-m-muh game journos s-said so
---
These mongoloids also think BfA is good.
---
Mate, I am Brazilian.. yeah, we're pretty big, and we have around the same or maybe even twice as many players as the other Latin american countries combined.. I just don't know why you mentioned us when this is a post about the spanish speaking community going to Faerlina, whereas we are going to Thalnos.. I hope they create a great community over there, or even help us do the same on Thalnos if they choose to go there too.
---
If they aren't showing then perhaps you should.
---
Besides not long ago there was was client update.
---
poor internet lul
---
Take a name quickly and then during a quiet period of the day a week or two later quickly delete and customise a character to your liking.
---
There’s an idea....
---
I'm concerned about what happens to our realms post layering.
---
They do investigate reports and it doesn't take them that long to do so. 
---
Complicated reports will obviously take longer if the abuse or issue is not "Easy" to discern. 
---
Text based abuse, like profanity, or stalking like in the example I mentioned, is a quick one and would happen within a day or two.
---
phase 1 is THE exact phase that should NOT have sharding/layering/whatever cancer retail mechanic there is
---
Credit card didn't work for me yesterday. Someone had to send me Blizzard dollars.
---
Yeah, Hunter becomes more support at some point in Vanilla.
---
How are you managing to do this?
---
When I log into my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) on a different laptop/pc it forces me to log out on one and log in to another
---
I was planning on just rapid fire randomizing the appearance until i get something decent
---
Tons of my friends "Offline for 8 months" are coming online today... hmmm what could they all be up to :)
---
No see, a fraction of the community knew in their hearts that they wanted Vanilla, that has nothing to do with whether it made business sense to do so.
---
Some are going Horde and some are going Ally.
---
Soda and Nick are definitely going Horde. Esfand and Staysafe are going Alliance. I don't know about the other two.
---
they will swap to online, but they only update ever 30 sec or 60 sec.  
---
so if someone logs in 10 sec before your server list gets refreshed he can join earlier
---
Dude, I am trying to farm some Karma here.  Why you go to cockblock me?
---
If the gods actually responded that would be immersion breaking for everyone involved, and frankly cause more people to quit playing on the RP-PvP realms than any amount of ganking ever would.
---
&gt; Look at the comment that's #2 or 3 in this thread.
---
Ah I should have seen that, it was right there!
---
He's right though. 50,000 out of 250,000 is 20%. And the responses in the survey were over 40% with more than one monitor.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Not for me on the latest test. I opened up 2nd client and servers were green while still being gray on the first one so..
---
Make sure on Blizzard website that the authenticator is not associated with another account of yours.
---
Look at the comment that's #2 or 3 in this thread.
---
Isn't this exactly the same thing Soda was talking about?
---
When you start the game directly from bnet launcher, you don't have to "login" in the game so it should not ask for the digital code. On my side if for example i cancel the login and appear on the login screen of WoW Classic, i have to enter a digital code as well, by passing by the launcher i don't have one, maybe something to help you :/
---
Went through on my phone! We good fam!
---
Only 3 characters per account.
---
Thanks for that! I really hope the community in the game will be good. That's one of the major aspects that's influencing me to play.
---
Any suggestions about what class I should play will be much appreciated.
---
Don't jinx it
---
While I was young played CS:GO with my father for years I even went to LAN-Parties with him, was awesome.
---
Yep, did that. Even changed it to another language and back... only German once I get in...
---
Blizzard's behavior and design choices over the past decade do not engender trust. They've showed time and time again that they do not understand what makes MMOs fun. Hopefully, the Classic team will right the ship, but for now skepticism is warranted.
---
As for layering issues: I'll believe that Blizzard will fix these issues *when they actually fix them*. No more of this "it's just beta, relax" nonsense. We've been burned by it far too many times to be giving Blizzard the benefit of the doubt.
---
I'd rather a slightly pretentious post instead of the mindless echos of "classic is dead" across 5 different threads before the game is even out.
---
Since you want to roll priest, I thought I'd send another message incase you're unaware of priest racial abilities. Undead get a lifesteal dot ability and a single charge damage-on-attack ability that reduces the attackers damage.
---
Trolls get a 3 charge lightning shield ability and a curse that reduces damage dealt.
---
so with this name pick does it let you make a character and log into the game at all?
---
Let the dutch please invade this server as a payback!
---
Nur ein bischen.
---
Thanks! Guess I'll risk it and stay on screen... wish me luck!
---
P.S.  
---
Nope, not going for Thex or a streamer name :)
---
He's playing Horde. Esfand and Staysafe are playing Alliance.
---
How much?
---
Heyo, a fellow ex-Burning Blade player rolling Herod.  I am down for this.
---
It's the "I'm Spartacus" of the last couple weeks. If you search by top posts this month it should be near the top. Somebody was asking for tips or something about reserving a name, and they gave their personal example of "thex". And then everybody in the comments made it apparent his post was a mistake, because now everybody and their dog is naming a toon "thex".
---
rumors that it's going to have a large BR population
---
Being skeptical is totally understandable, but trying to discredit other arguments using that same diatribe any time someone suggests giving Blizzard an ounce of trust just isn't fair.
---
Who cares
---
That's (partly) why I'm rolling Tauren...!!! Mulgore/TB...! :D
---
Nah my name is pretty unique, I doubt anyone is going to choose Threx.
---
Nope just character creation
---
It's most likely modUI. You can see this guy using something very similar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvQFTm2xIoA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvQFTm2xIoA)
---
Breath of the wild
---
I sure hope they don't but I think they will unfortunately :/
---
There's a class quest for everything.    Though iirc troll priests only got a green robe from theirs.
---
"confirmed" as a troll move
---
Yeah I only have this one account.
---
Wasting? No  
---
Like I said in my post, its what I enjoy. Also its not hard to kill a streamer. Usually there isnt loads of followers with them and its not hard to get more people to kill a famous streamer.  
---
Video as source -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anToIEy-oE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anToIEy-oE)
---
serious question, are you retarded?
---
Yea unfortunately the streamers are dope and I’d love to play with them but the legions that follow them around every zone are the real problem. The only good thing is they should slowly disperse as vanilla isn’t as forgiving as retail and they will quickly fall behind once they pass the barrens/west fall. If they want to troll they will lose levels doing it. 
---
For launch day for people who want to play on streamer server should look into exploration levelling. Not only will competition for mobs be fierce with the amount of level 1s but twitch chat will follow streamers around tagging mobs so they won’t get xp even if they can’t kill them which lowers your already small amount of mobs to choose from. At least passing those first few levels will help greatly in avoiding the conflict. Alternatively group up and go farm higher level mobs. Stay away from the starter quests if you want to make it out relatively early.
---
Same boat man lol
---
hehe yeh man. i was just trying to be funny. thanks tho! GL
---
This is why we need a designated Latin American and Brazilian server. So the community doesn’t become fragmented. What is blizzard doing??
---
It’s possible but it’s rare. If you don’t want to miss raids, I’d suggest going on an oceanic server and playing with the aussies.
---
We are all Thex.
---
Hard to no-life it 15 days before it releases.
---
Because most people wont min/max. They will want to be in Stormwind because it‘s Stormwind. 
---
I enjoy the greenery of Elwynn Forest. I don‘t mind taking a couple minute flight to Ironforge every once in a while for Black Rock.
---
[Skullcrusher Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ryNJVreiY).
---
No, 2 min.
---
Already got an rule 34 post, goddamn those guys are fast!
---
If you are on a PvP server, the streamer will have dozens if not hundreds of people around messing with zone balance, making the game unplayable when they are in the area.
---
There's going to be massive zerg fests of enemy faction players everywhere, what are you talking about? People ALREADY create huge groups to grief people and be unstoppable.  It's not a new thing. Streamers may have the potential to get a larger number but it doesn't change what is going to happen. 
---
You also act as if every streamer is going to be running in massive groups 24/7. They want to have fun too. Always being in a giant group isn't going to be fun for them so you can't expect it to be consistent. 
---
The world is also massive. Even if it's happening somewhere out in the world chances are you're probably going to be somewhere else or just avoid it ahead of time.
---
The way I see it is that person still has to navigate the login que, which could allow me that 30 second refresh to just hop into the server before them!
---
Druids are also good depending on what you want to do.
---
It did not update on its own for the Stress Test
---
\-Blizzard created BFA.
---
\-Blizzard thought sharding was a good idea.
---
\-Blizzard thought we didn't but we do.
---
Ah shouldve had that up there too
---
There will be both. Do what you want. Population is nice, but some people prefer PVE servers.
---
The concerned Azeroth citizen's comity that assembled in this thread
---
Holy shit why are you falling on this sword so hard?
---
Your example was shit and doesn't fit me. Let it go.
---
I plan to play on both servers.
---
Might actually make for a great PVP experience overall.
---
You will find guilds that raid at a time appropriate for you don’t worry
---
It's possible they are going herod, you should just expect it to a be cointoss as to where they are going, claim a name for all 3 servers and between now and then you'll better know for sure where the streamers will go
---
I don't get it but thx for trying buddy
---
You answered your own question. Those "minor" differences suck.
---
weird thex but ok
---
I had exactly the same thing, luckily I can speak a bit of German. Cancel out of realm selection so you're on the login screen and go to System &gt; Languages (4th option) and set it to english
---
Those guilds are going to be filled with people clambering for their 15 minutes of fame. There will be drama, and it's going to be petty.
---
Theres literally no reason why it would be different from retail.
---
I'm not worried about population on any server. I roll PVP to kill Alliance.
---
Weird. For me even launching from Bnet I have to login. I haven't played in awhile though so maybe that's it? It brings me to the login screen when I open from Bnet.
---
As someone who has grown up on blizzard games.
---
Blizzard knows absolutely nothing.
---
They’ve made so much money off of WoW just to let the entire genre of MMO run into the ground afterwards.
---
They’re balancing changes FOR EVERY GAME are fucking awful, I’m fairly certain they don’t give care what their player base thinks of how the game is balanced. (Notice how in the past few patches OW and Hearthstone had massive balance changes)
---
And now they’ve dumped millions if not billions of dollars into Overwatch League which is kept afloat by bots viewing on twitch. 
---
Blizzard and much worse, Activision is a horrible money guzzling corporation that doesn’t give two shits about their players or their employees if they’re not making money off of them.
---
But the games and worlds they’ve built are fantastic.
---
But they don’t know anything about the players. Because of them are real players anymore. They’re either employees, devs, or corporate shills. And they don’t hire players either.
---
I'll give it a try, if it doesn't work as advertised then I will sue you for false advertisement for $150,000 dollars or we can settle out of court for 1008 gold a week.
---
The stupid part is, you actually have no idea.  He's enough of a swamp troll with enough free time to actually do it, or he's just saying it to rile up his viewers, and you have zero way to actually tell if its sarcasm or not.

**&lt;Relapse&gt;** is a semi-casual progression guild that will be forming Horde side **Whitemane** We are currently opening recruitment for all classes and specs for Raiding, PVP, WPVP, Dungeons, etc. Guild leaders have experience in multiple expansions across multiple classes. We range from Duelists and Glads, to filthy casuals who look forward working together to clear content.
---
We are recruiting players who share our commitment to success in Classic WoW. We are looking for non-toxic individuals who want to level together, and begin raiding within a month or so into classic. Players who can keep a mostly consistent raid schedule, and have fun in between.

A fucking PATCH!? Blizzard, why don't you buy me dinner at least before you *fuck me*. I'm somewhere that has battlenet on their blacklist, so I'm using my phone to mobile hotspot so I can reserve my name. Connection is fucking slow as shit, but it should work. I installed Classic on my laptop this morning just for this and now I have to download a fucking patch.
---
Swear to god if I miss out on snagging Thex I'm gonna lose it
---
Shazzrah players have small dicks

I'm glad these streamers are letting people know because I give 0 fucks about playing on a server with these tools.

I played in BC, like BC was already "over" but never played Vanilla and i'm waiting for 7 minutes to go by so i can create my toons.
---
I’m gonna be so mad if I don’t get my name
---
except it's random. a ton of ppl will have to restart
---
But do you can haz cheezburger?
---
that warlock looks like shiet
---
I'm glad you guys came around. It was just stupid seeing you guys go to war with the community just to potentially make the first couple minutes of mob tagging easier.
---
At the end of the day, making thousands of people happy and relaxed was the right decision.
---
You mean CTRL+V, lmao.
---
got my name copy pasted and ready
---
For me it did.

Lok'tar Ogar, Wolfbrother! Seven minutes to go

Esfand is the real MVP here
---
Can you double click a server to join it or do you have to click "Okay"?
---
Yes in their 50s and when selling stuff. No one was selling anything and everyone was low level.
---
&gt; No, like layering.
---
Won't be a problem. Unless you want the game to literally be unplayable for the first week or so. 
---
&gt; Like the fact that you can hold down space to go up in water.
---
Pretty sure you can.
---
&gt;  Like the delay on looting vs pservers. 
---
Pservers are not a bench mark for anything. 
---
&gt; Overall, classic is a lot more laggy than playing on pservers.
---
Again, not a bench mark and I haven't noticed it.
---
If you like world pvp, then there will generally always be a horde (or alliance) of 20 some odd people running around a streamer. They have also already shown the ability to run in game dueling tourneys and such.
---
I don't doubt that Faerlina will be popping off for quite some time, I just imagine it would get exhausting after a while.
---
I dunno.  Does that work in combat?  Someone who pvps should lemme know.  
---
I dunno what blizzard is doing. I was correcting the use of defined terms.  
---
If folks are fading in and out of view around zone edges then thats not layering. Thats phasing or Sharding.   Blizzard has told us that they’re not doing phasing or Sharding so either (I) they’re lying (II) it’s a bug or (III) we don’t know everything about how layering is supposed to work.   
---
I’ve written at length about what I think Blizzard should do to make more folks happy while still keeping populations high for the foreseeable future.  And haven’t gone down that path here since it’s outside of this scope.
---
Will the servers automatically come online or do I need to log in and out?
---
thanks for the answer nice people and fuck the no life virgins who downvoted me
---
I’m having a friend grab one name for me, he’s a good dude.
---
One thing I loved about the private servers was that everyone was together.  If I wanted to raid in the early morning I could always find french people to roll with.  Normal times I could roll with Americans.  Middle of the night I could roll with Aussies.  It was great.
---
Hey thats the name im chosing aswell
---
This is more of a long-run thing, but I would recommend leveling as combat swords and not buying ambush, backstab (and higher ranks than 1 for gouge and kick) at least until you have your mount. There is a really good guide out there with very good swords for leveling which are easy to get (dungeon quest rewards and stuff). Macro pickpocket to automatically cast before any stealth opener so as to avoid downtime.
---
It's 80IQ to think that people are not rushing to take his name on EVERY server regardless.
---
I agree. Wrath was amazing and at the same time it took a sharp in a direction that forever changed WoW and made it what it is today.
---
I dont have the drop down menu to select game version how do i launch classic?
---
Blizzard had access to more data when they nade every decision leading to the currebt iteration of wow, doesn't mean it's good or fair to assume they're solely making correct decisions. How far up Blizzards ass do you have to be to appeal to authority with some legitimate concerns (layering)
---
100%, these people don't understand statistics, math, or money.

Damn you're an asshole

All realms are locked right now

Anyone have a key to unlock the servers?

yup, something's wrong

Fuck, same

Logged in @ 6, 50 person que, got in selected Herod, disconnect on logging into game server.
---
Relop, 100 person que, in now, on logging into game server screen Herod, seems frozen
---
You got banned
---
Same problem ye
---
getting disconnected when i try to log into server
---
Yep....fail blizz again x.x
---
same
---
same, ugh
---
Yeah same here, well damn.
---
what are those things?
---
You're not offering any good or services so obviously no one is sending you money.
---
If you were offering to sing a song and post it to YouTube for 7.50 someone may think that's worthwhile and send you the money. I'd rather spend it on a sandwich so I value my 7.50 more than your singing.
---
You clearly value money as well, which is why you won't pay early because you expect a full month of playtime for $15. This is a valid view, however don't be surprised if your view has changed in 10 years when you're making more money.
---
Stuck on ‘logging in to game server’.
---
how are u guys ingame? it says the game is not playable yet
---
It probably was to allow streamers to get their name first.
---
Can't do shit
---
Same!
---
can't even get in
---
Is that not exactly what they are doing for classic? For example, there are only 2 USWest PVP servers. Only 2.
---
saw realms changed to locked. Tried to get in one, and got kicked out. now trying to log in again.
---
Same bro haha
---
halp wat do
---
Hey, that's my name! ;)
---
Yup same then tried to relog and im stuck.
---
locked for streamers
---
All locked for me stuck on logging into game server
---
My god
---
taking that name now boi
---
Probably so the streamers can get their names first
---
You're supposed to be able to create characters to reserve names at this point
---
Streamers first.
---
Realms are still locked. That means chatacter creation too. Blizz is tracking their numbers.
---
Okay at least I’m not the only one
---
I bet they'll figure it out in a couple minutes
---
Fie is the new Thex
---
Oh I agree, but blacklisting folks because they dare gank/camp you flies in the face of that so I'm just doing my part to contribute to the vanilla feel.
---
Thank me later
---
Half life 3 confirmed
---
What does it mean when the servers are "locked" in this sense?
---
Welp 17th in queue for Herod... nothing to do but troll reddit while i wait
---
Realms are locked atm
---
me 2
---
Sigh, I knew I wouldn't get this done before work.
---
Login in to game server...
---
I can't even get in. All realms are locked..

Same.

Wonder if things are just broken or if everyones experiencing this.

After trying to create a character im getting "Only players who already have a character on this realm may create a character" ??

I didn’t know this! This helps a lot! :)

Yeah same.

---
Fucking hilarious
---
I got in, made two, and then got DCed. Now it's logging in which after about 5 minutes changes to "you've been DCed".
---
Sweet, have waited through the queue 5 times now.  Each time it puts me on a realm I have zero interest in, then when I try to change realms, it eventually kicks me off the client and I attempt yet again.  Brutal.
---
Can connect to Myzrael or w/e the fuck it's called, can't connect to Arugal where I will be playing - Australian infrastructure hard at fucking work
---
I didn't really expect the only RPPVP server to be low population.
---
Thanks! Dude was my number 1 choice, he will be my main for sure
---
I can't log into grobbulus, when I select it it bumped me to atiesh and now it will disconnect when I try to change it :(
---
love how the experts on this subreddit know how trivial serving up hundreds of thousands of transactions per second is!
---
Same, such bullshit. I'm gonna wait.
---
Fucking double clicked Grob when servers were “locked”, got DC’d.
---
Now when I actually make it in it autoconnects me to Atiesh for some stupid fucking reason, and when I try to switch to Grob it disconnects me again.
---
Ive been trying to log in literally since 5 and I’m not even getting in queue.
---
Fucking god damnit.
---
Thx for listening.
---
I haven't played since Legion, is there a similar guide for what I can do to prepare for launch day? I'm not 100% sure what I need to buy or download 
---
Just posting this question here so I don't have to make a thread
---
Stuck logging in, until it logs me into some random realm.  Then go back to realm screen and continuously boots me.  Nice!
---
because Blizz fucked up and we wasted 2 weeks of game time for nothing
---
Got in when the servers got online. Queue, disconnected and re-queued. Got some of the names I wanted. Turns out blizzard logged me into the server I didn’t want so now I have to queue again to delete the characters and then queue for the server I first picked..
---
Let's make ketchup!
---
10000+ queue for herod right now
---
This frustration is equal to all my shitty days at my job combined
---
10 Minutes early? I've been chilling for an hour.
---
TIL being 91 minutes into a queue was the best I could have expected. 
---
*Currently can't even log in*
---
Threw me on the wrong server. Big oof
---
Wow Blizzard is stupid
---
It defaults to a realm, then its searches for game server then it puts you in a que. THEN YOU GET TO PICK THE RIGHT SERVER AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.
---
What a bunch of geniuses.
---
Also the last minute patch was beyond stupid.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Launch is gonna be a fucking disaster gg blizzard, you still can't launch a fucking game properly
---
I decided not to waste money on this just for a name I probably couldn't get anyway and then not even be able to play for another two weeks. Feels like such a cash grab, there's no reason they had to do this before the 27th. I'll wait until the game actually launches and take my time customizing my characters and thinking up names for them, there are hundreds of thousands of possible names to choose from after all. Good luck to everyone who tries for their names today though.
---
Broken as fuck.   I was &lt;50 in queue twice logged into server screen three times and each time it kicked me out to login.   Meanwhile my friends were able to log in to the locked servers and reserve names.
---
what the fuck.
---
LOL, oh man.
---
"Logging In"  
---
"You Have Been Disconnected"  
---
"You Have Bee..."  
---
FUCKAYOUU
---
If there is XX k people queing just for the name reservation...   
---
Imagine the actual release.
---
Disconnected 4 times already at the "Logging in to game server" screen
---
Make sure you are connected to Battle.net "friends" or whatever, I had the same issue during stress test. Had an unplugged icon or w/e on the Battle.net app.
---
I guess it must be, because it just seems like a waste of OPs time otherwise.  He could probably get these idiotic names in most retail servers today.
---
Me too :(
---
I was super ready and even really quick but this name is definitely taken on every server now :(
---
Got all 3 of my old names no big
---
finished 11k queue, Made a character, reserved name was taken, took another, Turns out its a random low pop realm, change realm, booted out of game, cant log in. gg.
---
or wait it out for 10 minutes only to get disconnected (ERROR # blah blah blah)
---
49s for me man, cant wait
---
whoever got Guthix on Thalnos please send me a message because my friends and I have every other runescape god name on that server
---
So only 3 per account and you can get auto filled into a wrong server lol. I now have to go delete characters and hope to get on correct server
---
I got everything I wanted, only took me about 4 tries to get in. Names were unique enough that I didn't expect duplicates.
---
It's animal.
---
Logged in immediately, 23rd in queue, took a few seconds to get in. Hot the "need more characters" error, assumed it was my fault, relogged, all the names I wanted were taken.
---
Spent 20 minutes waiting in queue. Happily created my characters and see that I'm on the wrong server.
---
Now back in the queue to delete those characters and make my characters on the right server....
---
Gross. Sounds like you became a reasonable adult out of necessity rather than choice.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Same thing, auto atiesh. Such a bummer
---
Incompatible? wtf
---
Selected Herod, got kicked, waited a while, and then I was able to log in. Made my character, got the name, but then the server says Mankrik
---
I got kicked out of Arugal, logged back in, got my three names, only to realise blizz autologged me onto an American server instead, now I can’t get back into anything and the three names I’ve taken are on the wrong fucking server :)
---
well at least I got my name on a normal pacific realm
---
Goosebumps
---
10,000 now lol
---
What if you
---
Wanted to go to heaven
---
But god said
---
**LOGGING IN TO GAME SERVER**
---
It's amazing that in the year of our lord 2019 Blizzard still can't pull off a launch even with daddy Activision's money.
---
I selected the serve I wanted and waited...and waited...and waited.
---
Finally it told me server as full and I was &lt;3000 in queue.
---
Queue took all of one minute, I got in, took my time and created 3 characters that look the way I want and got the names I wanted.
---
QQ moar guys.
---
I LOGGED INTO MY FRIENDS ACCOUNT TO RESERVE FOR HIM, IT DIDN'T PROMPT REALM SELECT, GOT ALL HIS NAMES ON ATIESH ON ACCIDENT, CAN'T GET BACK IN. GOT BACK IN, DELETED OLD CHARS, BACK IN LINE. NAMES ARE TAKEN FML.
---
if you ever actually get into the game be careful you're not on the wrong realm, chances are good you'll be thrown onto atiesh and chances are even higher you'll be disconnected trying to change realms.
---
great game.
---
I got absolutely fucking cock pounded with that update
---
same here and my friends
---
All this clutter and NO personal info that I can find. Impressive.
---
YOU CAN ONLY MAKE A CHARACTER ON THIS REALM IF YOU HAVE A CHARACTER ALREADY ON THIS REALM
---
WHAT
---
YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED 
---
YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED
---
I know full well you don’t have the name Asmongold. And whoever took it didn’t either they took it just so he couldn’t have it.
---
once everyone is forced into two servers they open two more?
---
Dont worry, most of us cant log into the servers anyway
---
Same thing happened. Was waiting and it just turned to locked without seeing any low or high volume. Complete bullshit.
---
WTB layering for login servers
---
FUCKK I SPAMMED HEROD AT SERVERS LOCKED THEN GOT BOOTED TO LOGIN, AFTER 8 MINUTE QUEUE IM IN MANKRIK WTF NOW ANOTHER 10 MINUTE QUEUE FUCK U BLUZARD
---
I believe you are locked out of recreating the same name when you delete a character. There was a link to a blizz post about this earlier today, but I can't find it.
---
I also reupped yesterday for $15 to be baited by the actual stress test. I should have known after 15 years, $1 for every year I didn't learn.
---
It keeps assigning us to different realms than the ones we’re picking! I DONT UNDERSTAND
---
LOGGING INTO GAME SERVER
---
DO I WAIT OR RELOG!? AAAAAAAHHHHHHH
---
Respect for referencing an amazing studio ghibli movie.
---
If I played firemage I'd take that myself.
---
happened to me too. And then it auto-choose some other realm. No Thx, I want Herod.
---
Axis representing🔪😤
---
who gaf?
---
anyone having issues in the EU as i got in fine so could be an issue elsewhere other than blizz
---
oh how nice of you to transfer me to a different realm than i originally pressed only to boot me out when i want to switch and put me back into the queue. thanks blizzard for the TRUE vanilla experience.
---
really sad tbh, definitely not getting the name i wanted. and honestly it will put a major damper on my experience especially initially. but whatever, i'll just fuckin deal with it i guess. at this rate i wont get any names because i still cant fucking get past "Logging in to game server"
---
You mean the layers will be something to behold
---
Reserved the names I wanted. Decided to go with my usual ne druid on one pvp server and made an orc shaman on another.
---
Keeps logging me into US server. Can't switch to Oceania.
---
I can’t even get past “Logging in to game server”
---
yeah, I'd prefer that over having massive queues and server crashes.
---
Weeee test
---
at the server screen, says theyre all “incompatible”
---
Fucking Blizzard. Wow have the mighty fallen. Fucking sit in queue for 20 fucking minutes just for it to directly log me into the wrong fucking server. Gotta start the entire process over again.
---
And these shitbags made everyone resub for this shit show just to wait 3 fucking weeks.
---
Same here. Shit blows
---
So I was trying for Bones, and my goodness somebody got that fast this was the second name I tried to type. Big congrats to whoever got it. Grabbed Wallstreet for my bank alt, and picked up some victorian female names.
---
Same someone snagged my first choice so I just used an alternative O
---
IF YOU GOT YOUR NAMES LOG THE FUCK OFF YOU HAVE WIT MORONS. GIVE THE REAT OF US A CHANCE
---
It’s move week. Got off work early. Fixed myself a nice snack got out laptop to log in. Forgot my laptop charger at the old apartment. 
---
Please press F to pay respects.
---
This happened to me when vanilla launched. My entire guild from Star Wars Galaxies rolled alliance and I wanted to roll horde due to my Warcraft 2 days of playing so much as horde. I reluctantly went along with them. After about a year I couldn't take it anymore and broke off on my own as horde and never looked back.
---
So I got DCed on my first attempt to get into Grob
---
I reload the game, and it takes 10 minutes to get back in. It puts me in a DIFFERENT realm and now I can't get back in to any other server cause I get DCed trying to switch realms
---
Brian birmingham etc implied in interviews the popcap will be higher than 3k because they specifically said the cap was that back in the day due to hardware limitations and nothing else.
---
So I expect higher now. 
---
But it'll probably be around 6-8k at highest and as you say.. 16k (HIGH EST) is still fucking absurdly crazy low even post tourists-era.
---
Its just not feasible.
---
Whoever got Ash on Lucifron, I sincerely hate you :(
---
I used checked battle.net for the names I intend to use (to gauge how many people have come up with the same thing as me) - and its pretty much just my own characters, plus *one* random guy. There are other names I wanted that have over 50+ hits, so names like those are the ones Im gonna reserve. The ones I normally use, are 99% likely to be available come launch...
---
I actually just cancelled my character creation and ended up in the character list after having the "only pkayers who already have a character on this server can create one" message.. Then i was able to create my character and reserve both my username, even did my main username on another server for the lolz. Happy!!

Downvoting all who exclaim how they got their characters solely to rub it in... Screw you.

yeah after seeing people try to burn everything to the ground after not being able to get into a stress test, this is the kind of reaction I expected. Just hope that everyone get off the sub by the time launch comes around
---
Judging by /new before the mods cleaned it you probably don't have to be worried about your name being taken...
---
Except maybe if your name looks like something that could be spat out by the random name gen then it might be taken
---
Tried to get the name Chad on Herod. Got booted from server 4 times. Still haven’t got in :(
---
Can’t tell you how excited I was to say bro after every chat
---
Wasn't able to get Tristessa on Whitemane. Pretty sad about that. If you happened to get that and are willing to give it up, I'd be eternally thankful :)
---
why is it so bad for oce all the time? unlike the rest of US our day begins shortly.
---
I got in in the first five mins, told I couldn't make a character because I didn't have any (???) and have not been able to connect to an oce realm since.  
---
feel bad for all the people who are trying to log in but have to leave for work, school, etc, and miss this chance bc of incompetence yet again
---
You could always use your real name
---
Whoever took my Dota names on Whitemane
---
I hate you
---
at this point I see Herod as the option with even more toxic people than Faerlina, seems like there is more people trying to avoid streamers than trying to play with them lol
---
Was logged in...  10 mins early...  said I needed to have a character first...  catch 22?  Relogged...  15 minute wait...  the names I spammed were taken... Oh well, I had backups that weren’t so interesting.
---
There, rant over.
---
yeah.. they expect EXTREME server load and thats why they put out 2 servers for whole EU to play on...  cuz "they know more"
---
i cant get into grobbulus :(
---
how are you guys logging in? :( it just tells me "Logging in to game server"
---
Looking forward to blizzard's update that they got way more people than expected and will have to add realms.
---
I had between a 73 to 90 on the test realm.   Seems kind of high really.  I am hoping some of that was just because it was a stress test.
---
Hahahah
---
Samesies.
---
I didn't get the second name I wanted for another toon; but the first was my priority.

Looks like that didn't age well, yikes.
---
Except I've been through queues multiple times just to be disconnected. I've been logged in to a server other than the one I've selected, and now I'm not even able to get past "logging in to game server" without being disconnected.
---
This is not "handled". This is a failure of epic proportions.
---
Incompatible?? All servers are incompatible....
---
Still for me...
---
That don't count m8.
---
40 Minutes, still yet to log in.
---
20% chance wins

Is that why the RP pops are low? I got my names on Grob.

Finally after 40 minutes they plugged in the OCE servers
---
Oceanic servers just opened
---
to Bear-Whitemane;
---
may your connection always be as swift.
---
This may not be obvious to you but many people are still stuck waiting to see the server selection screen, myself included. We paid 2 weeks of game time to have a fair chance at reserving our names and a 40 minute delay to some, with every second that passes, might have their names taken from them.
---
In a Skype call with a bunch of friends and I got in in like 2 minutes, the rest of them got in 40 minutes later. I feel bad lol

Papi no!

just keeping closing and retrying, 20 times and im now in queue for shazz

Do they really not expect this game to be the most played game in the world on release..? LOL why do they CONTINUOUSLY underestimate the success of classic? This company's awareness is something else.

if you don't have a character named qt somewhere you aren't a real wow player

10400  and then they put me on the wrong server  when i log back in &gt;.&lt;
---
i had my game on  since 23h or 23h30 when the server list came up.. i was prepared  , the servers not so much .
---
Arugal has been a RIP for my group, threw us into rando us servers, thought we were gg, but nah, cheers mate
---
Nice big brain take.
---
I got good names but it's weird since I have no idea if I'm actually going to play on the servers I reserved them on.
---
Gave up on Arugal, kept getting dc'd and I need to go to work
---
Ended up in a long ass queue, to the wrong server, didn't notice until after rushing to create 3 characters..............
---
If you took the name preheat can I have it? I've been stuck in a login loop and still haven't had the chance to make a single character.
---
Heartbroken if i didnt get my dwarven name that was random from classic lol.. i think its bugged though. Keeps saying i have a character there in realm select
---
Different realms? Seeing how you wrote “his chosen realm” I’m wondering if realm popularity is one of the decisive factors. Went for a PvE realm myself, which seems less popular, and got in right away and snatched three of my preferred names. So if he went for PvE ehile you’re going PvP or something like that...
---
I think it's safe to say that the name reservation chaos is the real stress test
---
I take it spec names are reserved? Instantly went for Frost and Fury the moment servers dropped locked status and both were gone
---
Somehow 5 mins went by, randomly decided to get Anduin (since Lothar was taken) and got it... really confusing! Didn't get any of the 5 names I wanted but this one is pretty nice, I'll use it.
---
Still don't have timmy tho
---
That's weird cause there's only one server with High pop right now, the rest are med-low. I hope you have a unique name bruh
---
Take a break from gaming and do excercise.
---
What about PVE servers? Do we know where people are going? I know that Spanish community is going on Pyrewood Village. Any other info? I'm most concern where the Italians will go that I can avoid server.
---
Can't log in and I *know* someone took my name. Damn all you Davie's out there!
---
No rage here I got 5 out of the 6 names I wanted!!
---
(Two Accounts)
---
I am having issues, I FINALLY got into the character screen, but can't make a character name because it says I have the max amount of characters for my account? I have not made a single character or reserved a single name
---
Why do people care?
---
Calm down
---
lmao same bro. I copped Netherwind for my mage, was so hyped, saw i was on pyrewood village /cry
---
I forego this custom flair and I want to instead give it to u/mipeirong. He is the People's Champion.
---
But where did you get the skull? Linkz pls
---
fucking me too
---
Not me :-(
---
If it didn't work, it means you put in your password wrong.
---
I'm stuck at work for another 90 minutes, plus the drive home. So yeah. My rage is more anxiety that my name won't be available by then.
---
Yeah looks like I'm stuck learning portuguese.  The fuck.
---
&gt;We'll remove the restricted mode setting probably in 20-30 minutes.
---
Lmao, you're gonna need a lot longer than that. These servers are mega fucked.
---
Why are the RP servers completely fucked?????
---
my position was 6k+ and just 3 min
---
Red Rising?
---
omfg i can’t even see what name i got it just disconnected me and now another 10k queue FFS
---
91 ms.  That's what I had on the server.
---
World of Timecraft : Classic lol
---
If anyone on Fairbanks for Arby dm me, I am willing to buy it
---
Had the same with the same servers as well.
---
Seems like it defaults to the lowest server when the other one is spilling over with characters.
---
Stuck at "logging in to game server" with realm list in the background
---
FINALLY
---
I GOT MY MAIN NAME ON GROB
---
The issue was this : 
---
@@ Edit: For people asking. I logged in 30 minutes prior, waited for servers to turn green and just keep clicking on create character + spamming enter to make the "only players who already have a character on this server can create one" go away. @@
---
People were not expecting that and they logged out. Blizzard should have made the message say something very obvious such as 'the character cannot be created at this time as the realm is locked, please try again shortly.'
---
Because of that tons of people whom were prudent and showed up early, ended up losing out when they got put back into a massive que.
---
Personally I lost out on two important names, though also got three other good ones.
---
WHY DIDN'T BLIZZ LET ME GIVE THEM MY DEBIT CARD INFO SO I COULD BUY GAME TIME AND GET FUCKED OVER TRYING TO GET MY THREE CHARACTER NAME THAT I WAS NEVER GOING TO GET
---
Did you expect them to fire up tons more login servers just for (what will probably be about) an hour (or two) of over-use?
---
Just went up. Lmk if you need a spare name on bloodsail. I'm 3/3
---
Holy shit, even before reading comments I made a comment about BfA beta too and then I saw your comment. I'm glad at least some people actually can remember what happened, I'd bet tons of people like OP defending Blizzard probably don't even play retail, otherwise they'd know why people are sceptical. 
---
As you said, basically a year ago exactly same posts from fanboys and shills like Towelliee were being created on r/wow, as response and defense against people like me, who were being worried after playing BfA beta about class design, azerite armor and so on. And we all know what happened, yet some people have short memory or something.
---
:(
---
10k people / 6min queue for Herod atm
---
It's bugged. I definetly clicked on Shazzrah, and when I got to toon creation it was on Pyrewood Village
---
Locked down my name on all 3 EST PVP servers \*flex\*
---
Because there's 10k+ people trying to reserve their name on the most popular server.
---
logged me into WRONG server. Disconnected a bunch. 30k que for Herod. FML, might stick with a different server if that's going to be the que on launch.
---
What lag? 1 pserver could handle 6000 ppl easily, at 8000 minor lags, at 10000 you could experience actual lag
---
All I wanted was the name adrian on arugal..  sigh
---
because that's what heros do
---
I'm hoping so. Grobbulus!
---
Apparently, I also was blessed on this wonderful day!
---
Ah ok..we'll see I guess. The stress test did not have these limitations in place. Would have been nice to test these limitations ourselves
---
What garbage. I put in a ticket for a refund on my sub
---
The weird thing about that, for me, is it means you’re likely to never see certain other guilds. If you have a few big guilds on the server, chances are someone on each will always be logged it, so they would force everyone else who logs on into their layer. 
---
There could be whole other huge guilds you’d never run into because you’re both stuck in different layers. That, or they randomly force-phase the entire guild to a different layer regardless of where they are or what they’re doing.
---
I am so goddamn stupid, why did I think I needed to relog to refresh the server list? And then when I finally do get in, surprise, it's the wrong realm! Back in the queue! FUCK!
---
Kyle on shazzrah eu, give me my fucking name back &gt;:(
---
Aaaamena Maaan!
---
Literally I got the name Soulfood as just a "give it a try, nothing else is working" and it fuckin updated and I'm tempted to use it instead of my usual names..
---
Doesnt he have some streamer gf now who cleaned him up?
---
Hoping I get my name on Whitemane as well. But I couldn’t get in when the servers went up and then I had to leave for work. So here I am, waiting for my laptop to update(like an idiot I forgot to install Classic on it) and crossing my fingers my name isn’t taken yet. It’s pretty random though
---
It somehow let me reserve 6 names.. anyone else experience this?
---
..... Can people please stop screwing farming apots?
---
That would be the rarest substance on earth would be big expensive
---
I really never even knew streamers for wow as I’ve been out of the game since wotlk. The only issue I would have is the potential power these streamers would have on a server. We picked our server the second they were released and hoped for no streamers. I just hope for a fun experience for all that isn’t ruined because my need roll was higher than a streamers and I get perma spammed.
---
Anyone managed to save more than 3? 
---
Exploiting since day -14
---
I got my two personal favorites on fairbanks for my ally pvp mains- Borbor and wentworth, and on myzrael I got my favorite meme name: Undead warlock named raycharles.
---
Is 27th midnight GMT I believe.  Happens to be the 26th in the Americas.
---
Just discovered we can no longer be logged into both Retail and Classic at the same time. During the stress test I was camping rares on Retail while tinkering around on Classic. No more.
---
Yea i did just now randomly have 1 of my names pop up, my 3rd stringer but still, gonna keep going
---
Got bugged out and 'error creating char' a lot and the servers caught up and I 4 names across my account reserved, 3 on 1 realm and 1 on another.
---
Hell yes, although 39 is the best bracket and the most fun class to play in 29 is a flag running Druid.
---
Def hope a good twink scene shows up on my server though.
---
I got tomchilton, my day is complete.
---
Layering is a Temporary Solution to the expected rise and rapid fall in server population. Blizz intends to remove layering in Phase 2. So if you have too many players layered on the same server then you get actual overpopulation.
---
What you are describing appears to be a world where Layering isn't removed.
---
Did you get it?
---
to the guy who said blizzard knows what they are doing: go suck on a morning star.
---
Got to reserve 4 names.
---
I got Brondo, its what plants crave. Good thing Im a mage and can summon. Pumped on my new name :)
---
I guess I got 4 names on Herod somehow.
---
[Proof.](https://i.imgur.com/vNP58px.jpg)
---
Please don't be retarded. If -we- knew there would be login issues, they too either knew or ought to have known this was going to be a problem, and then did nothing about it.
---
It does not excuse this level of failure.
---
Yeah i got 4
---
Power trip? Youre defending someone wbo wants to blacklist people for camping them.
---
Like, what the actual fuck. Are you just not self aware at all??
---
I misunderstood your comment, I assumed you were talking about me.
---
Still gonna camp.
---
I got the name Win and Metal.
---
No queue for me. Took about 4 minutes to log into the realm, but didn't have a queue number. Maybe they just hid the queue to avoid rage?
---
Well i got 2 of my names saved at least. Someone got the 3rd one. I guess 2 out of 4 aint bad.
---
If there's any Andy on Shazzrah here I'll gladly take it. PM me please.
---
Saw that 4chan claimed this as their main server can't wait for the incels to arrive
---
Damn, i have a feeling its going to be hard to find you.
---
It'll be interesting to see where Blizzard goes from here. Presumably not everyone who will play is trying to reserve a name right now, so the stress at launch will be even greater.
---
Somehow I got the name I wanted after all this time. Truly a miracle.
---
I got on after a couple of minutes and got two of three.
---
The third wasn't going to be my main, so I'm ok with that.
---
If someone got Casey in Herod, give it to me, I'd suck yo dick so hard your toes will curl
---
Same thing for me except I had to go to work before the servers let me in so I paid for nothing. awesome.
---
Pretty obvious at this point that Herod is going to be super overpopulated at release.  The other EST PVP servers haven't had any queues that I've seen but Herod is still sitting at 11k at the time of this post.
---
Feel free to join over at /r/shazzrahpvp and get the community started on an international level as well.
---
I am but I just used a remote desktop from my phone to reserve my name.
---
Lag hacks
---
&gt;Dude's scum.
---
hmmm okay
---
Its better deleting them chars for peace of mins
---
If you're out there, Apathy of Herod, can you please dm me? Thanks.
---
Will buy "**Bowser**" on **Shazzrah** and "**Arno**" on **Golemagg**.
---
Buying the name Delta on Faerlina, Herod and Thalnos. Message me if you have it. Im serious about this.
---
Oof. Yea, I was able to get 2/3 names exactly as I wanted them, Phoenyx was the only one I had to modify. Wish you the best of luck getting your name. Hopefully by the time you're on queue times won't be terrible. I wasn't able to get in to get mine for forty minutes.
---
Who got Mason on herod &gt;.&gt;
---
I dunno man. Pvp realms kinda died after 1945
---
Go, with honor!
---
Yes! Officially rolling on Herod.
---
&gt;any time someone suggests giving Blizzard an ounce of trust just isn't fair.
---
They **had** everyone's trust. They squandered away a lot of good will over a long period of time. It is completely fair to not trust Blizzard at all given their history. I'm even less inclined to trust Blizzard now pretty much everyone who built the company is gone.
---
Finally got in and missed out.  Chose Thalnos and got a Tauren Warrior named Bullin, Troll Hunter named TrollToll and my Tauren Druid named Freewind.
---
Yes, you do....in order to reserve your name...which Blizz knows is extremely important to many players. Hence why they required an active sub, which you don’t need for creating a toon on Retail. 
---
Good for you. That means no one else should have any complaints when it shits the bed for the rest of us. You did you.
---
And, of course, you tested it to know it actually works. As inn, you got to level 55 went into Silithus, farmed a bunch of twilight cultists, turned in stacks of pages and saw that you could easily grind to confirm that you actually can grind CC rep and also that you can grind to to exalted before the relevant phase.  
---
When ? On the beta on your 40 capped character or on the 15 capped stress test ?   
---
 ...   
---
That's what I thought. You don't know. You just waltzed in there probably dying a lot in the process to check what version of the region was used and *naturally* assumed that everything would be available.   
---
Obviously you won't be able to do it ahead of time. The reputation will be disabled until it's relevant.   
---
As for the mobs it's easy ... you just block that rep at Neutral. So even if you grind you get to 2,999/3000 Neutral.   
---
Given the content phases were the first thing they announced at Blizzcon, quite literally, I think they've put enough thought into this not to be cheesed so easily.
---
I got all 25 of the names I wanted. I must just be more skilled than all of you.
---
I Am Thex on Bloodsail... If for some reason /u/Zargoltir decided to play on the NA RP realm, ill be a man and give it up.
---
Maybe, I have Fury on retail, but I know they allowed a lot of names like that to be open in pandaland. I got Ffury tho so that's good.
---
You wasted your money.
---
So uh, who took Issh on Shazzrah EU? This has been my name since day 1 vanilla days on Burning Legion, such an uncommon name snatched right away , I was even there the moment they opened the floodgates - dang u son!
---
We going here as Horde.
---
Blizzard doesn't make mistakes  
---
I mean other than you know, all the mistakes it made   
---
but for real guys, they are smart. When they fuck up , we can just move the goal post
---
19 is the boxed wine of PvP. 39 is at least a rack of Yeunglings.
---
Me too! Got all the names I wanted on Herod!
---
I only got goji and omu, definitely not what I wanted but I’m a lot less pissed now atleast lol
---
Anyone else stuck on 'retrieving character list'?
---
For me it was the exact opposite. I was put onto an Oceanic server when trying to get to Pagle.
---
got two names I wanted. I guess thats the benefit of having strange names
---
I said "probably" because they haven't said one way or the other.
---
Honestly it’s simply because most of what pops up on my YouTube feed are reaction videos and cringey thumbnails
---
Imagine being so bipolar that when someone says they don't like something you think that the only other option is that they spend their entire life hating it.
---
Depends if you want quantity or quality. I've seen more alliance RP, certainly more walk ups, but it tends to be more military guilds where the officers/guild masters tend to try to make the story about themselves, pretty edgy, everyone tries to be top dog. Etc. Lots of military/extremely edgy cult guilds (don't get me wrong, cult guilds are fun but a lot of times... ehhh it gets excessively dramatic and edgy)
---
When I played Horde, however, the majority of the guilds I played were the opposite. Horde guilds that were very serious about RP were a bit fewer, but the RP was better and more focused on the community as a whole rather than the higher ups. Whether it was military, clan, village, etc. Guild, it felt like you were more apart of the community of the guild, and the quality of the events were a lot higher. Things were a bit toned down in terms of edginess, and the walk up RP that does happen is a lot less "I'm the main character and I can't be beat". 
---
Now obviously both sides do have anomalies, there are good alliance guilds that focus on the guild community and horde ones that focus on edginess and the higher ups. It's just that I find what I said above to be typical after playing on both sides on Wyrmrest Accord and Moon Guard for years and some on Emerald Dream. 
---
Grobulus might very well be different since there's a ton of people coming from several different retail realms to one server, so it'll be very hard to say for certain which will be better.
---
This...  
---
If you go to the Wowinterface website (wowinterface dot com) there is a page labelled “Addons for WoW Classic” that is regularly being updated. All these are 1.13 versions as far as i am aware.
---
You will have to manually download them and put them into the *classic*/Interface/Addons folder but once you do, the twitch client should pick them up. That way you can check if the authors have put updates on curseforge.
---
The main problem though is that the Twitch client is buggy as hell when it comes to using multiple version of wow (ptr/retail/classic). It has been like this since Blizzard changed the folder structure to incorporate the ptr client into retail. I contacted Twitch reporting bugs and asking about updates and they just said “We are currently working on bug fixes”.
---
That was 2 months ago…
---
WTB Siren on Herod. Will pay with tendies and mtn dewey.
---
Seras of Whitemane, would you consider releasing that name? I've gone by that name since TBC ;u; Faerlina would be cool too but mostly concerned about Whitemane! Thank you for your time ;3;
---
Yep, they’re on shazz now.
---
Whoever picked muffinman on Pagle alliance... I'll pay you to give up the name lol
---
I got all 3 of my names!
---
Call the cops nerd
---
What about when there's folks on different servers but the same character name or guild name and they merge those servers?     
---
I suppose if the idea was to let servers die in the first place they could make character and guild names battlegroup wide or something then merge servers along the same battlegroup, but that'd probably anger people wanting certain names and etc.    
---
No matter what Blizzard does it's gonna piss people off. Even no merging, no layering is gonna piss folks off cause of mob spawns, quests, resource nodes and etc.
---
If anyone got Qu on Shazzrah! My friend would be ever grateful if he could continue with the Nickname he's had since early 2006!
---
This post did not age well.
---
lmao
---
Ok. Griefing is defined as actionable/suspendable or bannable. So that means you think anyone taking a streamer name should be prevented from doing so, the *offender* be punished, and the streamer gets the name.
---
If that's not what you meant, then don't use a word that is literally defined by Blizzard as in violation of their ToS.
---
I'm sure it wasn't accidentally taken... That we can agree on. I'm sure Thex wasn't either. So what? Rules are same for all, and that's how it should be.
---
Did you enjoy it, atleast?
---
The legacy of Thex lives on in all our hearts!
---
[You deserve all the praise you gain, and more for being such a solid dude.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/027/838/Untitled-1.jpg)
---
Have fun being dime a dozen. Like Undead Rogue, there‘s just so many of them.
---
Really? Hydraxian has literally no queue time but Pyrewood has 10k waitlist
---
Praise Hydraxian Waterhomies, I do want to make a normal realm character just in case but cba for queues
---
If anyone's got Impaler out there I'm ready 2 pay for that shit
---
pls
---
80-90
---
Does anyone know if they are going to take it down Tuesday for maintenance?
---
you are actually a loser ... Pat ... rich coming from a keyboard turner kid to snatch that name lol
---
Theres an automated mute system, give or take 40 reports trigger an automated mute on channels so there doesnt need to be gms.
---
Unfortunately I don’t have it downloaded and I’m not home from work. I wonder if I missed my window
---
That sucks, don't worry it happened to me too
---
Person with dirtydan on Faerlina, can I have my name back :)
---
You’re a very pathetic human hehe
---
lmao nah
---
Cause it's copyright.
---
I got to work, got Classic installed, now I just keep getting "You have been disconnected". Fortunately, I had my best friend on backup and he managed to get my name on Herod.
---
I got 6 lol
---
He is memeing.
---
Yeah most likely. The name choice is only applicable to the server where your character is.
---
Go read twitch chat
---
Ah damn I was going for Mother, then tried father, but got Daughter on Herod.
---
Dont worry about it. You'll be able to delete it later and recreate it. They should have the servers open until launch for character creations.
---
I just wanted my rogue to be called Hayley....
---
So did you get Senohpolyx?
---
That's pretty lucky haha
---
That’s false. A lot more than 2% don’t want to roll the same realm as a streamer.
---
Did you get ironic ?
---
Knew i would never get frost made me sad
---
I got 5 names including my girlfriends actual name, my actual name with an extra letter and her DnD toons name. Cant complain!
---
My mom played it together with me. She was better at it than I was at 15. I've learned much since then..  xD but yeah never had any problem with getting my sub paid by my parents. When BC and WotLK came out, my dad actually stood in line at the store at 5 AM between all the teens to go buy it for me and my mom lol
---
Dude doesn't care about reputation. He just wants views. Reddit rage brings views. More views more $$$
---
I appreciate you
---
Same. I was getting proper don't start this WoW shit again looks from my partner when he left for work and the games not even out yet...
---
Mods are people too!
---
Got in immediately on two accounts, WOULDNT LET ME CREATE ANY CHARACTERS THOUGH
---
Unfortunately the ones I actually were aiming for got taken too quickly.
---
That's a cool set of characters!
---
as an spaniard im not a fan of spaniards lol
---
Well I'm European as well, and we've already traded names in my friends group, so it doesnt seem to work like that. Would also be super weird, since you're then able to reserve way more than three names
---
keep trying it told me name not available everytime but I kept spamming my name anyway and eventually I saw I actually had it on character screen
---
...What?
---
Aside from trump, how is that different than back in 2004?
---
Why not just do what pservers do and havce 15k on one realm and use dynamic respawns then? Since they just decided they're doing dynamic respawns without telling us anyways. Whats the point of layering at this point?
---
I got Kerrigan, Ouch, and Maya on Herod, no rage here :)
---
Ah nice. Well, that'll give you a chance to set it up later when realm queues aren't so hectic then.
---
Don't sully the name of the Assman
---
https://youtu.be/o2X_XNdmWws
---
Congrats!
---
WTB Narrosh on Harod
---
You're tearing me apart!!
---
Happened to a young kid I played CS with back in the day. He didn't log in for more than a year and then I heard a story about a kid that fell out of an apartment complex window. Turned out it was him. I mean, I didn't know him much but still a bummer.
---
All i know is i waited in a 20k queue just for people to reserve names...
---
Thanks for the respecting the community, you guys avoided a lot of needless toxicity on your server.
---
I was an unkillable god shaman @29, with 1h and shield, almost always top of the charts. Till all of the heirlooms came out. Want to do it again.
---
Alrighty boys im gonna try and post this here and see if i can't get the name "Wes" on Faerlina.
---
This is a really long shot, hail mary basically but if the person that rightfully took the name is out there and would be willing to trade for "Extortion" that would be swell. If not, well i tried /shrug.
---
This hits me in the Asheron’s Call feels. 20 years ago. Our guild was tight in that game. We even did a camping trip together once on the California coast. So many great folks that I’ve never heard from again and sometimes wonder about.
---
They absolutely want him on their server. It just would give them more exposure
---
Staph. Get some help.
---
I have one slot left to reserve a name, and i'm on Grob! Whisper me your btag and i'll try to reserve it for you!
---
Yeah she is already sick of hearing about it. I told her potential raid nights. Maybe we can just message eachother for the next two weeks to give them a break lol
---
I'm kinda confused how come Herod is the only high pop server while all the others including the supposed streamers server is on medium?
---
Thanks!  I was very surprised!
---
300k people have created names on Herod.. you realy think that will boil down to 3k in a month?
---
All 12 of the possible names I wanted were taken.  All my names now have ö and å in them. 
---
Fuck off blizzard on putting everyone onto 3 pvp realms.
---
I made a secondary with a slightly changed name and created the character again then deleted and recreated the original and the name was still there :D
---
Ten internet points to whoever took Asmongold on Faerlina, provided they never give it to him.
---
Took 58 minutes, and two sets of character creations, but SAME!
---
Calling someone pathetic for something they are doing for fun is, well... pathetic
---
got a three letter name on Herod :)
---
Should have made more servers
---
Like how those FPS players turn their keyboards? No idea how they are comfortable doing that...
---
I mean fair enough. I dont tend to watch streams of games I currently play (I could just be playing the game) but its now one less streamer I'll check out ever, but I'm sure it's caused more to watch him than its caused to never watch him.
---
WTB Tessa on Herod
---
I tried to get my real name too, Scott. Feels bad having a common name. RIP
---
Hope you had fun in my hometown
---
The French players on live dedinitley do this. My toon has a French word as a name and every now and then I'll get a random whisper in French to join their guild.
---
Very nice! I didn't get the names I wanted for my first round picks (Parts, Dude, Bro, Who, Why, How and Man) But I was able to snag What (Warrior), When (Hunter), and Where (Priest). Not horrible.
---
That's definitely the classic experience, 1+ hour queues were common :)
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_testing_(software)
---
He’s only allowed to post due to being a Hearthstone Mod. He might be a mod here too
---
Yeah, all servers were rendered incompatible. Finally decided to reinstall the game and that worked, but by then the two names I really wanted were gone. I didn't want to brainstorm names so I just grabbed ones I thought were decent
---
Anyone here got Kaze on Whitemane? DM me ;)
---
I respect you so much.  That sounds amazing... enjoy.
---
Why would you throw the opportunity away to play together? Doesn't really make sense to me, realm type can't be that important?
---
Welp. I got 'Brooklyn' but not on Herod. WoW put me in a random realm queue and I got Pagle instead.
---
for the first time in my 14 years of mmo gaming i finaly got my name
---
Dragon
---
I have reserved 5 names. I don't know how, or if it's real. Could just be a bug. I kept getting error messages, "error creating character". So I tried other names. Eventually when I made it back to character select I had 5 characters made.

Thank you for mentioning this. I've been trying hard to make sure people know about the channel, so that people don't end up using world. 
---
Some things to note:
---
\- From what I've seen, you don't need to capitalize it exactly. I tried /join lookingforgroup on the stress test, and that worked as well.
---
\- If you right click the main chat tab, and go to Global Channels, then you should see a button that lets you join the LFG channel through the UI. There's also one for worlddefense.

FEELGOOD STORY OF THE YEAR
---
So I feel like everyone has a right to downvote this after name reservation. No hate, it's just undeniable evidence that this post is blatantly wrong lol
---
&gt; Whats more confusing is the demonizing, like is not speaking English suddenly akin to being a troll and or a shit person
---
It's not because they speak in another language, it's because in general they act childishly or "unprofessionally".
---
[I broke it, guys.](https://imgur.com/cF9KM1Z)

I've only become aware of this guy when someone posted the video of him at Gurubashi during the stress test. Guy is highly delusional. You guys ARE buying into it though so you might wanna chill.
---
Anyone manage to get Rouge on any server?
---
I got in without a sub!! ^(J/K)
---
OK that's funny
---
Prove it? Reddit is a subculture. Sub being a small portion of. Lots of redditors will never bother to comment.
---
All the vocal people are a small sample size of a small sample size.
---
Play both.
---
I know it's a long shot, but if anyone here has Shake on Mankrik, let's talk.  Used that name on my rogue from Vanilla through Wrath. 
---
Tried connecting to Mankrik and kept getting DCed.  Finally logged in to the character creation screen and got Shake, as well as two names for my friends. 
---
THEN I see that in the DC nonsense, I got switched from Mankrik to Pagle.
---
20 minutes worth of my trying to delete characters and getting deletion errors, I finally freed up a name reservation, only to find out Shake was now gone on Mankirk.
---
Like I said, I know it's a long shot but if anyone here got the name, shoot me a PM.
---
I got Nike on herod anyone interested in purchasing?
---
My friend somehow managed amongst the massive lag.
---
Kazragore - Grobbulus
---
See everyone on launch day :D
---
Female undead can actually have the "I'd like to speak to the manager" haircut.
---
You got bamboozled hard :(
---
IF I SEE A SINGLE "JAJAJAJA" ON MUH SERVER I'M QUITIN' THE GAME.
---
They need to make an NPC name Mipeirong now in the lore somewhere that says he was a warrior of ancients past or something, and then his predecessor "Thex" (also dead and valiant hero) were good friends. This is so wholesome.
---
Was wondering how far down I'd have to scroll down to find this
---
Glad i went alliance gonna fuck them up
---
If anyone has the name Riot on any US server, please DM me. Please.
---
They won't be able to, the issue is everyone logging in at the same time which almost never happens. A company isn't going to spend the resources to build infrastructure to accommodate the login of hundreds of thousands of players all at the same time for a single time of a products lifetime, it's a complete waste of resources and honestly the community can deal with an hour or two of login issues.
---
Asmon is extremely lazy about everything. Always procrastinate everything. What he means by talk to them is asking esfand if that's true. That's all. He is going wherever esfand/mcconnel goes.
---
And even worse you didn't even play elys because while that indeed was a shit show it had 10k plus players and 20k plus in que. But that was a long time ago.
---
If you got "Enemy" on Shazzrah - Eu. Pm me.
---
yeah I think it was the generic "error" that popped up so people changed names and kept spamming
---
I saw the error once and kept spamming the same name so I only got one out of it
---
Lookin for the name Terminus on Herod, been using it for years. Super sad not to get it.
---
Thigh incelcizor waifumain
---
yeah I know what you mean , although every time we all just say "this is fine" or "this is just how it is "it just says that its ok for a company to use the lowest effort /lowest cost method to do things as  customers will put up with anything.
---
I mean if there's a bottleneck would staggering character creation by server (or small groups of servers  say a one PVP and one PVE) a few hours apart have helped?
---
now kiss
---
Remake it in a week or so when no one is on.
---
Haha yeah! I re-watched  that right after posting.
---
Should have Gulgank.
---
I got my name on both the oceanic servers, Pretty happy
---
Nah, but I got the names I wanted the most :)
---
At least you got your names, congrats btw! I'd be really mad if someone took mine, but they aren't common choices as well so it wouldn't be a problem if something like that happened to me I guess.
---
Feeding the worst parts of the gaming community isn’t inspirational.
---
Yes I am, because you don't seem to be able to comprehend that there's a real person on the other side of your screen. It takes a heavy-handed analogy to get through a thick skull.
---
All fuckery aside, Faerlina is gonna be one lit server.  Imagine the LOTR numbers of people crashing the server as they go to war in Hillsbrad and stuff.
---
Oh that's not terrible. Thanks.
---
&gt;Unless you're a frost mage... Nova, sheep one just in case, blink, mount up and ride the fuck outta there.
---
in reponse to:
---
&gt;he is delusional to think that a blacklist is gonna stop corpse campers lol, all it takes is 2 rogues my guy... 
---
You never implied that 2 rogues can't kill a mage? Not at all?
---
So, I got in really quick when the opened the gates and was dreaded with - "In order to create a character on this server, you have to have a character already on this server."
---
NOT A JOKE!!!
---
How long are they locked for friends after you delete?
---
I nabbed myself a Gnome named Punt so im happy lmao
---
Ah ok
---
!RemindMe 2 weeks
---
Bad move, many people will never add or inv you just because they don't want to bother with special chars.
---
I'm so happy for you dude. Thanks for helping to make classic launch special.
---
won't this make it annoying to invite people or share your name?
---
Apparently one where there’s better internet...
---
Because streamers and there following weren’t a thing in 2005, thus making a server with no streamers on it creates a closer original experience to that :)
---
That’s insane. I don’t know what the hell I’d do if that happened to one of my best friends. Surely you asked other friends/family if they knew anything?? The school?
---
**Herod Horde (NA - PVP) Warrior LFG for Dungeon Leveling**
---
Looking for a group to dungeon level with that is going to run a roughly 16h on 8h off schedule from launch until lvl 60. If you're interested in having me, give me a shout on discord at Nytro#7018. To show that I know what I'm about, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DXAV5GWpUjiBbE3nWg4ZvXR6a6689lKEXXtx3bMn7t4/edit?usp=sharing) is the plan I had put together for my old group before it fell apart.
---
Can't wait to hear from you!
---
Looking for Nolo on grobbulus, its my sons nickname and i thought it would make a great troll shaman name ty.
---
Whoever took Darkwraith on Herod could I have it? Been my handle for gaming since RS Classic (darkwraith20). Logged me into Mankrik and I thought I had it, but wrong server.. Please and thank you!
---
I was able to get "Retail" and "Classic" on Grobb....
---
But then Customer Support told me they'd likely get changed if reported, so RIP.
---
Oglops from FF9?
---
If I had the weight to throw around at Blizzard HQ I would do it.
---
Yeah, it was such a sinking feeling when I saw 'Pagle' on my screen.  I don't know why it changed servers on me like that, but here I am.
---
As soon as you delete it becomes available for anyone.
---
Weebs rise up! Get your tendies and hunny mussy ready, bros! Mommy needs us in tip top shape for the culling of the Undead scourge.
---
Can someone TIL how that happened? Is it just the dope-ass name?
---
Glad I bailed on Herod.  It really comes down to Blizz not having enough servers.
---
&gt;15k players without issues
---
This sounds like a hot load of shit. Do you have any evidence? I can’t find any vids of SH/ND at launch.
---
Vs and er very nice
---
I love this kind of calm way of thinking
---
Alas that I have but one internet point to give this comment.
---
Omg I got this too. I clicked okay 3 seconds after servers went live and if just logged me out shortly after no were code. didn't get my name by the time I got in :(
---
Who got Kavik on Herod? Let me know!
---
Yep..  for some reason it put me on a pacific server when I chose Mankrik... or so I thought.  ahwell.  I got 3 names i'm moderately happy with.
---
I am so furious right now. I was position 1300 or so on Herod right at the start got dropped and then kept out for about 30 minutes. All of my names are gone, fuck Blizzard.
---
scrolling down my friends list has not been a fun thing to do for about 10 years. so many people that are just.... gone. 
---
many i know are just find started families or just moved on to other games. but there are still 2-3 dozen people  on the list that just vanish over night. they are the ones i miss the most. only one on my list do i know for sure no longer walk the mortal world. may his pain finally have ended.
---
in a panel last blizzcon they had a default pink color for things that didn't have a texture setup. 
---
they found things pink and had to find it or create it.
---
Anyone know the server name of the US RP-PvP server?
---
&gt; He talked to them on his Stream and they decided to give it to him for free. It was someone subbed to him apparently.
---
It was a ploy.  Planned out ahead of time on every server. He "Cried" and got 5k in subs in about 5 minutes in pity.
---
I like... hehehe
---
It was all of us - we are all Thex.
---
(but it was especially u/mipeirong that made it special for me)
---
Are you interested in those names for he novelty of them surely being unavailable in something like retail? Or is there something else?
---
What makes you say that?
---
Who ever got Slipn on Herod please message me. I've been using that name online for over 18 years and it was my main in vanilla. 
---
This just won't be the same.
---
I think a lot of people are really overreacting.
---
If took the name toeknife Ill pay you for it. No troll
---
Very much appreciated, good on you guys!
---
Damn that's a good one. I'm a add you in 2 weeks bruh If you need a healbot
---
Yeah PVE servers pretty much have no que, even Thalnos is minimal.
---
I had two clients open, one logged into the realm select and the other retrying to log in to refresh the realm page.
---
The realm select client stayed grey until about 6:03, but the constant login one got green servers about 20 seconds after 6:00.
---
what will be server max pop?
---
who or what is AzHeelvsbabyface?
---
its obviously a joke as hes stated hes playing on a different server. your first 3 sentances are hella cringe though.
---
Just curious, why would those get reported?
---
Duck you who took Terminus on Herod.
---
he makes 50k in a week
---
Dude idk man go watch some vods or something. Maybe there's something on YouTube or twitch you could search. Or go ask some pserver players. If you played you would have known.
---
Selling the name Speedy on Golemagg and Chakra on Shazzrah
---
So I got super lucky logging in! I was able to snag the names Nemesis, Ghoulish, and Sick eeey! https://i.gyazo.com/24dadaddf3ec56123359f8da872fa72c.jpg
---
Blizzard also "knew better" when they took WoW down the casual-fest shitshow of LFR and dailies resulting in sub numbers plummeting. When they added garrisons and nothing else to a game that was bleeding subs, accelerating the bleeding. With the whole "you think you do, but you don't" fiasco, with Azerite traits, etc etc. Blizzard have shown that they have poor foresight, time and time again.
---
There's currently 6 English-speaking EU servers, 2 PvP 2 normal 1 RP 1 RP-PvP. The PvP servers were high pop instantly with 12k+ login queues, the normal servers are hovering at medium-high with small queues, the RP servers are low with no queues. This is for name reservation, 2 weeks before release, with many people not willing to resub this early on.
---
Launch will be a mess. People will be deterred from playing and there'll have to be some very intense layering to keep the game remotely playable. PvP server players will have a miserable experience.
---
It's clear that no, Blizzard really didn't know better in this case, 1 or 2 more PvP servers on EU are sorely needed but they're being cautious.

Time to get a new wife
---
Already deleted, restarted Bnet, re-enteered, remade character (all in all took no more than a minute for an obscure name) "Name unavailable"
---
Pservers had crazy queues and nobody ever said „oh man I‘m gonna quit“
---
If anything, it made me feel good to know that the server was brim full and I had to wait to get in on the action. I know it‘s weird, but I don‘t think it‘s a bad thing.
---
It‘s like a very good small restaurant that has a line of people waiting outside. It just confirms that the restaurant is seriously good.
---
I‘m not saying 1h queues are for everybody, but certainly the max we would get it 10 minutes ,which is pretty bearable.
---
Why would they report this...?

No thanks, you can keep nopants crazy psycho lady. I like my women dumpy and droopy with halitosis.

This guy really is a shitstain on the underwear of life, everyone else was polite enough to announce their plans ahead of time and also contain themselves to a single server to help mitigate dealing with Streamers and their "fans".               
---
           
---
I personally don't watch others play video games while vomiting words on a chat room sidebar maybe because I never ate tide pods and played with fidget spinners but that may have a lot to do with my age but whatever, people get enjoyment out of different shit and while 70% of my hate for streamers is jealousy I have to give mad fucking props for every major one of them for allowing the rest of us to play in peace with a nice little heads up, except for one.            
---
             
---
I'd say he is doing it for clicks or whatever metric is used on Twitch to monetize the needed overhaul of his dental surgery to get rid of that rat face but it sure would be nice for a ton of people if he would commit before the game launches.
---
u/mipeirong [Thexy]
---
I’d say you’re overly mad about something you should care about. If you honestly think streamers are gonna make that big a deal then you have a problem. Reddit has a massive hate boner for streamers, and asmongold not saying his server to stop the extremely toxic haters on Reddit from griefing him constantly is smart. He is the most “hated” wow streamer after all.
---
Fuck I replied to the wrong person
---
Pretty sure Thalnos was taking the Spanish and Portugese speakers.
---
guy on left seems mad he didnt get name, guy on right seems to be reveling in it. lmao
---
Alright that's fair
---
Why it always has to be a 2 sided competition, live and let live.
---
I'm reading this nonsensical quote on reddit so it makes sense.
---
hope youre joking
---
What are you even talking about. They all are on faelina. Look it up
---
Jesus you dun goofed.
---
Welcome! :)
---
Second
---
on the EU side it is pretty clear that we need more english speaking PvP servers since both once maxed out and has stayed maxed out to where both did the auto kicked and you just had to keep trying to log in to the server.
---
Any thoughts between an Enchance Shaman vs a Shadow Priest in terms of effectiveness and enjoyability?  A lot of people have really hyped warrior with shaman.
---
I got the main name I wanted, but not the others I wanted, but overall I'm very happy.

I got Dunk and Artorius

And I'm using my third spot to save the name of a friend who couldn't log on today.

That'd be some f\*cked up masochistic bullsh\*t.
---
There was a happy ending to the Thex saga
---
They worked fine for me on other realms.
---
Its a reservation issue caused by population.
---
I was going to go Faerlina, but who cares I just wanted the streamers all together, I assumed it'd be on Herod. Herod will be good times.
---
What faction will u be
---
I have Loli and Flash on whitemain yolo
---
no shazzrah?
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long answer: Have you ever played Warcraft 3 or the other games? If not, and you have any interest in strategy whatsoever, play the WC3 campaign. It'll put you in the same place as all of us veterans when WoW first came out and we got to see this amazing game turn life-size.
---
Which is why I’m suggesting that Classic goes in a different direction because the current expansion format is by many, myself included, regarded as one of WoW’a big mistakes. Making all previous content obsolete is in my opinion bad and I think Classic should go in a different direction than retail. Yes Classic is an entirely different game from retail and I would prefer it stays that way.
---
Ah fuck it, I'll chip in $3.99.

Im going to say no imo. Only one high population server per region.

Fucking with cosmetics was just waste of time to begin with.   You should have just picked a random character and typed the name in.   Assuming, you had a name that wasn't obscure.

Ah that explains it, cheers mate. I hope you got your names aswell^^

Watch the fucking video. Do I need to do all the work for you? First of all I played and it was 15k peak. But if you watched the video you would hear he said he started an hour or two after launch.

Unless there's manipulation (and I don't see why someone would care to do that) I think it's safe to say a majority lean anti-streamer based on the content at the top.
