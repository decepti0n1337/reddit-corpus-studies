I half agree with the smart enough thing. I was in Vanilla too...
---

---
It's not that people were stupid so much as people formed opinions about the class that never went away no matter what happened. So like Feral Druids, it took until Naxx came out before people cottoned on to the fact that they could tank raids.
---
I remember for the first half of Vanilla people refused to take Paladins as a healer in 5 mans also... for no good reason... I would join for LFG healer and then get kicked because I wasn't a priest (or have to argue that they are objectively wrong and they'd let me in). That one went away sooner than the feral tank one, but I still remember it being a thing.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm not expecting this to work 100% lol. I'm basically hoping it's a close to viable meme spec.
---
---
---
Wait till you meet Gordo defending his plantation.
---
PEoPLe OF DaLRan LOok tO tHe SkIes!!
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with this leeway, spell batching 2004 tech in 2019 shit.
---
Also layering is a mess.
---
For farming, it depends.  If you get pvp gear, the tier 0/0.5 or 1 gear, that gives you a bunch of spellpower as well as mixed stats overall that make you extremely versatile in basically any role, regardless of spec. Also, you can look up videos, but balance druids are actually quite good at the lasher farm in DM:E as well.  And balance would be technically faster at princess clears, if that's something you're looking for.
---
You're probably looking for a "moonglow" spec, similar to the one here: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zjx0MxsZZixcoxq.  You can put the points in a few different places, especially the resto tree (I go furor for pvp, but if you're not doing that, a guild would appreciate the improved buff, for example).  Also, depending on your professions, if you're farming mining or herbs, this kit will have enough to defend yourself a bit.
---
If you like shitting in a hole in the ground, yeah...
---
&gt;If you are truly "casual"
---
- then go full hardcore. ;)
---
Dude shut the fuck up
---
They can probably hamstring people offline now
---
Was trying to keep this on the DL, but this is the spec I’m going to be run in my hardcore griefing guild. 
---
(http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cVVGd0xoZxZ0EVVo0z)[http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cVVGd0xoZxZ0EVVo0z]
---
Its goal is to have as many cc’s as possible to be as annoying as I possibly can. I plan on early on using the ZF stun staff, or maybe Silent Fang from Scholo. It’s not viable as a 1v1 spec but works as a tank hunter grief spec in order to annoy my horde enemies as much as possible while my group aoe’s them down.
---
Should clarify that it isn't just the font, it's how the numbers pop and move around when you get a crit, and how long it takes to fade away and other such details. As far as I'm aware there's no way to fix this through an addon, at least not on retail.
---
Don't play it then, we won't care.
---
&gt; Its sad blizzard and some people rate success by the money they make instead of the amount of people actually playing &amp; enjoying the game.
---
It's not sad, it's the nature of business. Which is all Blizzard is.
---
They do not give two shits about you as a human being, they care about your wallet. The only reason they ever do anything to the game is to make sure people keep playing it and buying shit within it.
---
Get that through your head and you'll lead a much more successful life and hardly ever be disappointed by anyone.
---
What if I told you that those details, while changing the game, do not change the social aspects of the game that made it a hit in the first place.  
---
Plus, there is still time to get them right and blizzard is responsive to feedback from this beta from what I've seen.
---
I hope your day is getting better :)
---
It's boring for healers, but tanks and certain DPS have to be smart about listening for ins and outs, making sure they're not too close to the mob, etc.
---
Worst class to raid as in EQ is a Shaman, hands down. You couldn't pay me to be the buff bitch.
---
But will be gone and nobody will care about layering.
---
Batching and leeway are garbage, but the title is still true, even if it's a complete shit show at launch - it just being up is enough to succeed.
---
When I want to play an mmorpg there is nothing that's worth the effort, classic changes that - not because I want to relive my past, but because there is no mmorpg like Classic that will have a playerbase throughout it's lifespan.
---
Vanilla talents only give the illusion of choice. Sure, you can decide to gimp yourself with a shitty build, that doesn't make it a good system
---
It's fine for leveling so it's not so empty but it's not actually well-designed.
---
just because you dont see any fun in it doesnt mean it cant befun for someone else.
---
yeah 2% crit is hugh, a stab wound can heal, crit is here to stay!
---
Discovery points? Pretty much 100%
---
My guild killed blockade first week too :)
---
I think it's entirely possible that you're confusing a lack of hype with a lack of will to watch others play the game. In a game where immersion is one of the top qualities, the experience you get watching a stream is absolutely nothing like playing it
---
Only thing from retail ill miss is saving $15 a month to not be subbed
---
At the start of every dungeon:
---
"Roll need if you're gonna equip it immediately, greed otherwise"
---
I *think* what’s happening is the hit chance with the pole is based on the fishing skill, and since his fishing skill will be way higher than his 2h skill, he won’t be missing while he fights with it.
---
Against all the norms, UNDEAD
---
ftfy
---
Then don’t play.
---
you....you're using too many napkins. bampkins.
---
7 weapons and no bow because it went to the warrior and rogue for reasons unknown. Yay everyone fucking over everyone is all the hunters fault.
---
I wish that pack would make a comeback, was the first thing I installed.
---
I don't think respec @ 40 is a big deal as long as you plan it out. It's 1 gold at 40, then 5 gold again when you hit 60. As opposed to 1 gold at 60 if you stick with one spec all the way through. It's only expensive when you fuck up and need to reset your talents multiple times.
---
Imp Wand + Spirit Tap is all you need to level without hating your life. It's going to be slow no matter what, so if you enjoy that build, then go for it.
---
I love it.
---
What race are you going to play as ally? I will play on horde side and I guess Ork is nice combined with some survival talents.
---
This is sort of what I had in mind.  I'm sure there will be hard core peeps in Classic, but I expect there to be a whole bunch of casual-time players that can coordinate to get some stuff done without a full no-life requirement.
---
Stop spamming this.  If it gets deleted don't just post it again.

---
&gt;It's not like that in retail classic. There is a far more casual and steady player base and these dungeons will be run a year from the start as much as week 4.
---
Hopefully. Realistically, the two markets for classic are going to be pserver players, and people coming back for a shot of nostalgia. Everyone will be running instances hard at first to gear up for raiding, then more casual people, but I wonder how long classic server will run before the nostalgia dies out and it's a for-pay private server. People stuck around and kept the game alive leveling alts in Vanilla 'cause there was no competition.
---
I might be mistaken about Monkeynews specifically but it's true that Tribe said, on stream, that Tips is the one who got the private server guys into the beta.
---
Ever hear of /ignore? Boom, done ezpz. I doubt you will run across SO many horrible people that you hate that you will max out your ignore list. And if you do you can just removing the older people on the list as they might not even be playing any more.
---
If you can't just ignore them and look the other way that says more about you then about them. Even if they are harassing you /ignore STILL works because it will block them and they have to spend the time to create a new character and message you. Like Ganjan said, if you're so lazy to create a ticket it must not be that big of a problem.
---
He wasn't fired he left.
---
2. It’s called inviting someone to a party.
---
I just tested it on the beta. Ranged attacks does get extra range, but obviously you can only use instant attacks.
---
Didnt they remove right klick reporting s while ago in the beta?
---
Well he says in the video that they showed him the door. Im not very familiar.
---
I'm just upset I never made bank on SoW potions.
---
I plan on taking 2/3 at 59 and 60, but that's because I'm doing something non-standard with ele/resto.
---
I think you need 3% hit for cap in pvp, and in general if you plan on fighting same level mobs for grinding it helps having full.
---
2.6~ + 2.6~ != 10
---
Yes. They’ll bring it back for classic release though.
---
Thanks for the test!
---
Isn't the chat filter on be default? So you have these massive pussies turning OFF the filter, get offended, and then report people of bad langue. It's fucking crazy to hear people defend this trash.
---
It never got deleted, i deleted it. Lol
---
WOW this is insane.
---
**To be clear** this is not my video. I came upon it while binging Classic videos and the community seems split between calling one side authoritarians and the other side talking about how this isn't a freedom of speech issue.
---
Is the divide warranted? Is the right click report problematic or is it beneficial?
---
if you refering to the tumbnail, thats the untamed blade which is not uncommon to give to ofspec palas since there are better warry 2h in mc/bwl
---
I had this card back in the day. Good times...
---
No. This guy is overreacting. I bet that the vast majority of people who get banned are going to be those that are; racist, homophobia, transphobic, harassing others, or telling people to kill themselves.  
---
If you want a 100% “free speech game” go on the private servers and you can hear all the “Jews run the world” conspiracy theories that you want.
---
Does the leadership seem competent and does its members seem to have a good team attitude. For all the talk about drama, ninjaing etc killing guilds, nothing ruins a guild like bad leadership. There are GMs that work with their members and their are GMs that manage their members, and one is vastly more successful than the other. 
---
One of the best guilds I've ever been in was a pretty casual guild that was way way more picky about their recruits than many hardcore guilds. Making sure the members of your guild actually fit together as a group works out really well for some peculiar reason =)
---
Off topic, but back in the day I got Kang the decapitator off a random world drop while questing in the burning steppes and it might have been the best day of my life.
---
If that's the case then why would these reports auto-silence or auto-kick people? If it should be reviewed then no action should be taken until a real human looks at it.
---
Go play on private servers then. You can spew all the vile shit you want there.
---
WoW/Yugioh crossover memes my life is complete
---
Sorry friend, not a native english speaker.
---
That's just you bro
---
you dont need a dps spec to farm herbs and ore, which makes farming herbs and ore less of a important activity since you dont need the 100g to respec :D
---
I'm glad there are others with the same interests!
---
Most honor is from winning and token turn ins. If you're losing random BGs in 20 minute games vs premades on your own factions winning in 10, you're going to be left in the dust.
---
Warlocks are pretty gear dependent in PvP, but they're at least serviceable in pre-raid gear. You can beat the things that you're supposed to beat if you play well (casters) and your DoTs will at least take a nice chunk out of the things that beat you (melee).
---
Dark times....
---
I think with right click reporting it makes it too easy to report. It’s *so* convenient to just right click report someone for anything and everything where reporting someone should be reserved to, I don’t know, actually breaking the rules.
---
You can’t really see it in modern wow since no one talks, but in Overwatch you’ll see “Reported” in the chat the second anyone does anything less than perfect. Say something rude? Reported. Died when you shouldn’t have? Feeding, reported. The act of “fighting toxicity” becomes toxic. Whether or not people are actually reporting or not whenever they say “Reported” is irrelevant. People are just conditioned now to literally report someone for breaking the rules whenever their feelings get hurt, as opposed to ignoring the person or growing a thicker skin.
---
Of course it’s nice for things like reporting spamming/gold selling.
---
It’s not about one report dumb ass, it’s about groups of people exploiting a clearly abusable system
---
Choose classic setting, but then turn the environment distance all the way up. My Mac is worse than yours in every way as a 2014 air. I’m extremely happy with how it run the beta
---
Or, and hear me out, play how you want.
---
Sharing the same CD. It's not a bug. Private servers just changed it.
---
Final fantasy is just incredibly slow. The giant global CD just feels awful coming from WoW. The story is cool but level your "alts" is the most boring thing imaginable. It's like running RFC 200 times in a row.
---
That's a no from me dawg
---
Good hunter can be the diff between a wipe and a kill in ubrs though, Rend fight kite and kill dragon kin, kite drakisath, fd trap as needed but the problem still stands 99% of hunters are trash.
---
Harry Potter you pleebs
---
Having trouble finding an example. Do you have one or know what it would be?
---
Layering most certainly does effect the social aspects of the game. I'll be very happy once it's gone in phase 2, or so they claim. 
---
Sharding/layering has and never will feel good. I understand them wanting to have a smooth launch and try and keep server populations as high as possible for when the burnout kicks in or new players just checking it out but not getting gripped by it stop playing. 
---
But the sooner it's gone, the better.
---
What if I call my friend a f\*\*\*ot in a public chat? That will 100% get banned and censored. When in reality it harms no one.
---
And what if people are racists or homophobic in chat? People that don't like it won't play with them. What you do is you type /ignore and that persons name and you don't see it anymore.
---
There's also a mature language filter that filters out bad words that make you fragile snowflakes cry and want to tell mom that bad man said bad word and now you are hurt.
---
So me playing FF, and the issues I found with the game are some of the same ones Peon commented about, shouldn’t matter because the comments disagreed?
---
If you enjoyed FF so much then make a detailed post for the OP so he can make an informed decision
---
Which gives them ~18 months to announce their plans for Retail. And then 6 months later, they'll announce Classic is shutting down.
---
There's tons of crybabies that will report anything that is slightly offensive.
---
Why dumb though if the reward was 200 honor per geyser.
---
And I’m saying that I’m sure there will be things in place that will flag you and there will be some sort of algorithm that analyzes your chat and looks for key words before it bans you.  
---
Like most games.   
---
Weird how I’ve played League of Legends since beta, WoW since vanilla, and OSRS since release and I’ve never been so much as muted on any of those games.
---
Didnt say it was E for everyone,buy as a 3 year Wowbeez vet,i can say private servers with 10 minute boss respawns do help on practices and rotations
---
 RemindMe! 35 days
---
I'll be too busy filling my poopsock and sweating profusely to bother complaining to be completely honest.
---
Okay, and there will probably be some algorithm in place that looks at key words you say before you’re banned. Like most games nowadays.
---
I don’t play FF, but I can read the hundreds of comments that debunk his video.

This post won't be around long but let me tell you DON'T play pirate servers! They are very inaccurate, you won't get a feel for classic at all. Just be patient.
---
I see people always complaining about being told to play only certain specs due to usefulness then people post shit like this that make it seem like an entire class is useless, another day in classic reddit.
---
I captain
---
HOLY FUCK. Dude I havn't heard Gob since early High School! Thank you so much for linking that! I forgot all about them, and lost what mp3's I had like a decade ago.
---
You are overestimating the amount of layerong that will be going on too. Past the first week after the twitch babies find out classic ait for them, i doubt there will be much.
---
Why should that exist though? People should be able to say whatever they want and let the community handle it. If most of the server is okay with people being toxic assholes in chat so be it.
---
Its a BoE, depending on the group and what you guys established at the start of the run, everyone could/should be rolling on it.
---
Obviously as the Druid, it would be cool if they let you have it, but with a BoE world drop, that can go either way.
---
You can’t debunk a persons feelings...
---
I don’t think people should be racist, homophobic, transphobic, or send any sorts of harassment towards other people no.
---
Just don't use homophobic slurs like that in general chats. Gaming companies are responsible to a degree for the conduct in games so this won't be a free speech simulator.
---
Fishing skill is essentially the weapon skill of the fishing rod. The lower your skill relative to an enemy, the more you miss and the more you produce glancing blows for reduced damage. Improving the weapon skill won't give + damage to your attacks(outside of reducing glancing blows).
---
Here is Esfand's pally video from a month ago explaining the concept better than me.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXP5eJIgBHQ&amp;t=1s
---
I did. Very hard to tell around here lol.
---
I think people are more afraid of wether this system can be abused, rather than actually letting people say whatever they want without consequences. The solution outways the potential abuse it can cause, I guess. Statements such as *"There will be a human element to the reporting"* is not very assuring. In the end it boils than to wether you trust the system/Blizzard. On top of that, it rather feels like the we're treated as children, let the community sort it out, who cares if someone's an asshole you know.

Stormx would like a word with you

The Hunter with 7 Weapons?  He's one of the most powerful cards in all of Duel Monsters!
---
It's weird hearing people say how great leveling priest is, because wand/spirit -- even if it's efficient -- is boring as hell. It sucks that so many leveling strategies require robotically managing hp and mana to eliminate food/water at the expense of actually using abilities.
---
1) Your Bow
---
2) stat stick melee weapon you should be always using,
---
3) The Nightfall Axe that you convinced your guild leader to give to you, because you convinced the guild leader to have a druid offtank.
---
4) Backup Bow for when Nef destroys your main weapon,
---
5) Backup Backup Bow.
---
6) Hydrocane
---
7) Resist Stat Stick you "forgot" to equip.

---
The thing about ff14 is you shouldnt feel a rush to clear content and the story is the main appeal to the game so kts a very different experience to classic.
---
Give the trial a shot while classic is still coming  as the early portion is a huge drag compared to the later content.
---
Of course they shouldn't be, but the point of Vanilla is to handle things ourselves and not rely on blizzard policing and regulating. If there's a really toxic racist guy on the server, people can just refuse to play with him.
---
When you're mounted, running through a group of mobs 20 levels below you, and one still manages to daze you.
---
Before you have a mount, when you're running away from an enemy, and they follow you just long enough to get one hit, which dazes you, and THEN they evade.
---
I mean if someone’s sending death threats or being racist, transphobic, or harassing people I’d prefer the to be out of the game.
---
You definitely can train some stuff before 10 btw, i know Polearms come later but in stress test I was able to train 2h swords at level 9 while I can't do the same on pservers.
---
Hunter with 7 Weapons...OBLITERATE!!
---
Real talk does anyone have an actual shopping list of healthy items to stock up on for the launch day? I plan on going big dick but with some nice items and not just cheetos and white castle sliders.
---
From what I understand any item that was in pre 1.3 will be in the game from launch, and it will be in its 1.12 appearance no matter how many times and when it changed in vanilla. As for quests most things points towards all available quests in 1.12 vanilla will be in game from launch whit the exception of maby silithus and raid/dungeon specific quest for content not yet released
---
Then don’t play and stick to private servers if you don’t like it.
---
Clearly, he goes FACE!
---
Just make separate cakes and merge them after they're half-eaten.  A bit more work for the baker, but much simpler to eat.
---
those mini-cut ingame cinematics in retail feel so out of place. They don't feel good in MMORPGs.
---
If it's really bad people can write a report themselves and it will be handled. The issue is automation makes it so that it's just a tool to exploit and it will be exploited like it is on retail.
---
Make hot dog with bun and fixings. Put it in bowl. Dump mac and cheese over it. How about now?
---
Ape guide for ape class that requires 20 seconds to master. Why did you even decide to spend time on that shit?

All the YouTube is full of that shit nobody cares about.

You think you are an epic YouTube blogger now? You are not.
---
What’re you talking about? I love tanking. I raid tanked for years and had only great experiences.
---
It's exactly that.
---
You’re absolutely correct but I do not have that optimism for early UBRS runs in Classic. You don’t know what kind of Hunter you’re getting...*shudders*
---
there is a power spike and survivalbility  at 40 if you re-spec into shadow priest vs level 46 to unlock it if you keep the imp wand.

It's not a complaint but observable fact. Your defensive response is unnecessary
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/File:Wow_collectors_edition.jpg 
---
Quite a few things. The best being the in game pet at the time.
---
Keeping living in your diluted fantasy buddy.
---
I'll be honest. You most likely won't get a raid spot as enhancement shaman. However, if you can show your skills in totem-twisting, I'm sure some guilds will be interested in taking you, although dps wise... yeah it's lackluster.
---
It is for Greater Magic Wand. Not for Lesser Magic Wand. Sacrifice a little speed at the beginning to be one of the first to Greater if playing by yourself.
---
As of right now we have no idea how it will work. That's just a guess people are making but at the moment it's not working like that at all.
---
So what do you call not allowing people to speak freely about anything they want?
---
IF
---
1 or 2 max per raid though
---
Play Warlock? Still get a cool pet, leveling is fun and you're still useful at end game, just not as good as a mage.
---
Are you arguing that hunters should be getting strikers mark over melee?  From the same dungeon that gives Rhok’Delar?  Or are you implying any hunter would even want Blastershot, thereby putting themselves at the bottom of the list for the leaf?  Most hunters won’t even blink at any ranged weapon that isn’t the leaf or the crossbow specifically because of how much better they are than any of the others
---
WotLK
---
Most raiders can do that by simply raiding.  If your hps is up beyond what’s required, why not flip a healer to dps to add a little bit extra.
---
have fun getting camped by us on day 6
---
Yes, but they’re very loud.
---
I laughed out loud, A+ content
---
You can also holy nova aoe grind with a mage friend if you want more action.
---
Get help.
---
not sure why you'd compare a dps to a tank class
---
With auto-ban/squelch you can be muted for saying literally anything.
---
Isn't it also safe to assume that Horde will get there first, due to having more quests?
---
Another huge difference is having access to all your spell ranks. Only need to heal the tank a little to top them off? No need to waste mana on a massive healing touch, just use rank 4. 
---
Same applies for dps abilities for things like frostbolt that apply slows.
---
Typically if not always the lower ranks are also much shorter cast time
---
I’m playing Night Elf 100% purely for the Shadowmeld and a bit for the Dodge chance. 
---
If you had plans to run this as a main pvp build (which I am) I’d HIGHLY suggest Tauren. Having the extra cc is massive for this build + the extra stam. Tbh, Tauren is perfect for this build, but I despise the Horde as a faction, so my best choice is Night Elf. Shadowmeld is really helpful while leveling + getting the first hit on classes you wouldn’t typically get as any other race.
---
One time I got a hydrocane and my group was soooo mad I rolled on it.
---
Following my own guide, I’m level 38 now in the Beta with 3K/21K revered with Darnassus and 5K/21K revered with Stormwind and about 2/3 - 3/4 of the way through honored with Gnomeregan Exiles and Ironforge.

Level 47 may be the most realistic target to reach exalted with Darnassus once you can start repeatedly turning in Un'Goro Soil/Morrowgrain for additional Darnassus rep. The other reps should be achievable after level 50 with repeatable Runecloth turn-ins. Completing all quests up until that point will certainly get you closer, so you won’t have to do as many turn-ins to finally reach exalted with those reps.
---
Try running around your local mall screaming racial/homophobic slurs and see how long you last.
---
Not the most practical, yet...I gotta admit, I kinda wanna see a paladin in BGs killing people with a fishing pole.
---
I'll never forget the hunter who outbid me on the corehound tooth. At the time best in slot format rogue.
---
Oh that makes sense then. No reason other than you are either hateful, edgy or want attention.
---
I disagree
---
Shamans at least you have totems, direct healing and "aoe" chain heals.
---
That IMO makes them the most interesting in PvE Raids.
---
Paladins I would say are the most boring as you only spam blessings and your direct heal for crits.
---
Priest is ok, bubbles, dispels, hots.  Most well rounded healing kit.
---
Druids have hots, but hots are really kinda shit in Raid PvE and regrowth is horribly mana inefficient.  No res sucks in instances, too. Forced to downrank Healing Touch endlessly, but at least you have clutch spells like innervate and rebirth.  
---
Shaman &gt; Priest/Druid &gt; Paladin.
---
Paladin is no doubt stupidly strong in PvE, as long as you don't die of boredom on the way to and at 60.
---
I don't go through their history, RES does that for me:
---
from [Deplorable] NovercaIis [/r/the_donald user]
---
That isn’t true lmao
---
While my guild exploded at this time, it was not so much the A group versus B group.  It was more 10 people took 2 weeks off work and were max level and in Kara before the second 10 to 15 people hit max level.  
---
The 2 week difference in most of the guild hitting 70 (and some key players taking even longer) *and* the fact that raid sizes dropped from 40 to 10 and 25 pretty much caused the guild explosions.
---
Wrathgate was kind of cool because it was completely out of nowhere and it was the first time they did it. It felt like some massive raid that a single player was participating in.
---
Now every instance and every quest has a 10 minute cutscene that other players get mad at you for watching because it slows the instance run. MOP had voice acting without the cutscene which I thought was a pretty good tradeoff.
---
The dps should be smarter and do more dps to make kill mobs more dead fast
---
Good to hear, thank you.  
---
How do you fare with rogues before LAPs come into the game? Just hope you have the succ out or your void sac does the job?
---
I got the 2 handed epic on my main back in the day, I imagine your rage was immense
---
They have them, they are called warlocks.
---
I was just making a minor correction about an artist I really enjoy. And mostly poking fun. But you sure seem hateful.
---
Maybe this is where my downvote came from in another thread.  I was in a guild with Cheeky, who wrote the Hunter Bible spreadsheet, and he and our other hunter were putting up TBC-caliber DPS in Molten Core.  The big discoveries he made had to do with the interaction of latency on the rotation, which made for counter-intuitive gear selections - things like epic bows being *drastically* outstripped by blues.  I was awed but ultimately didn't care, since I was a shaman.
---
Summarizing my favorite point of the article: 
---
One of the most popular games of all time doesn't exist anymore and it's a travesty.
---
I can't wait for 8/27.
---
We are going to unionize, wishing well all those who want to clear UBRS without a drak kite. 
---
But in honesty it's crazy the microscope being a hunter puts you under. Terribad mages, rogues and healers get carried constantly, their mistakes are never noticed. We perform at the highest standard 😃
---
Now this is a story all about how
---
My life got hooked turned inside out
---
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit next to George
---
I'll tell you how I became the Prince of a town called Ironforge
---
In West Durotar born and raised
---
In the Cleft of Shadow is where I spent most of my days
---
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
---
And all crafting some poisons to gank some Gnome fool
---
When a couple of officers who decided all loot
---
Said "sneak into Dun Morogh and give them the boot"
---
I got in one little fight and the blood ran red
---
So I think I'll stay in Ironforge until all the Dwarves are dead
---
I stealthed and taunted with them day after day
---
In the Mannoroth forums they called me stupid and gay
---
I blew them all kisses before my attack
---
Only leaving for raids though I always came back
---
Now Classic is launching and my rogue can go home
---
It's been far too long since I had me some Gnome
---
I used to sit and gank in BRM and Searing Gorge
---
But now motherfucker, I'm the Prince of Ironforge
---
yikes found the SJW. men are men and women are women, triggered? try not to kys LUL
---
Likewise, I'll pass on being wrong and lying on reddit all day long too.
---
I find it funny you admit you can do those things but choose to sit on reddit all day, no one believes that bullshit.
---
They were around at the same time.  TS had slower development while Vent kept updating frequently.  Vent was my preferred, but also played other games where TS was used.
---
There was a bunch of mobs up in the field and I got layered when the mob was below 50% hp into a layer with all the mobs dead and the mob I was fighting gone. This can definitely slow down your leveling, especially if you are trying to get ahead of the pack and this keeps happening.
---
After hours the initial release, there was still lines for the starting quests. Getting level 5 within an hour might be beneficial over waiting for a quest.
---
I played WoW from Vanilla through Cata and FFXIV from it's launch through present. I've done serious raiding in both games through almost all expansions. Here's my take:
---
The story is the main appeal in FFXIV. It starts out really slow IMO but gets better as you get closer to 60, then gets REALLY good when you start getting into the expansions. If you aren't already playing the game, know that it's going to take you a long time just to get through the main story. I definitely don't recommend skipping cutscenes!! I did this for a while when the story was slow then regretted it later when cool stuff was happening and I was lost. 
---
The raiding for me has never been as enjoyable in FFXIV as WoW, not even close. Maybe I'm just getting older and grumpier, but getting with my 40 man guild to finally defeat that tough boss in WoW was SO satisfying! In FFXIV I find myself just getting frustrated when people keep messing up the same simple mechanics. However, it's definitely more casual friendly. If you're patient enough, you can easily get all of your best in slot gear by just pugging, no real commitment needed.
---
Leveling in FFXIV is fine with your first class when you're going through the MSQ but leveling alts is an absolute grindfest. There aren't enough quests to level more than maybe 2 classes, so you will be dungeon/FATE grinding a lot. Alt leveling was one of my favorite things to do in WoW but in XIV it feels like more of a chore. On the bright side, you can get a class to max level much quicker in XIV so it's easier to try multiple classes to find one that you really enjoy.
---
It's hard to say which game will have a better community. The player base in XIV is very friendly and generally extremely forgiving of mistakes and helpful towards newbies. But everything is cross server now so don't expect to see a lot of familiar faces like you will in WoW classic. I remember vanilla WoW having a much nicer community than retail but I don't think it was ever quite as friendly as XIV's. If you happen to be interested in RP, FFXIV has some amazing RP communities, hands down the best I've found in any MMO. Plus you get to decorate your own house/apartment if that's your cup of tea!
---
Personally, I'll be keeping both subs active but I left my FFXIV static at the end of Stormblood and won't be raiding this expansion. I do want to keep up with the story and maybe run some casual content now and then, but my focus will be WoW. If you've already started playing I think you should be able to do something similar. If you haven't started yet, you might not have enough time to get into the really good content before classic hits, depending on your playtime.
---
TL;DR If you can spare the play time, give FFXIV a go, it's an awesome game and is very casual friendly!
---
Cool, thank you.  
---
So assuming everyone is at similar gear levels, are warlocks at a disadvantage in the early phases or are they simply at an advantage later on due to scaling? 
---
I guess I'm a bit confused still as to whether their gear dependence means it's tough if your outgeared or if it's just tough full stop before later phases even if you're similarly geared to your opponents
---
If it's less than a minute long fight sure. It's something clearly on farm. So whatever you want.
---
You forgot to mark that nsfw
---
3.
---
Leaf, ashjer'thul, and the slavemaker
---
You too. No harm done.
---
Sounds like some dirty porn
---
Don’t forget the balcony pull in Scholo 🙏
---
I literally typed what you said in your previous comment and you still said I was wrong.
---
I mean holy fuck 😂
---
I assume you think they did buff the xp, do you have proof or are you tinfoil hatting it like me?
---
What would one call that?
---
the only time i see this as necessary is when a new layer gets opened and the players get redistributed between them so 1 layer isnt nearly empty and 1 layer is full.   
---
uneven layerpops would mean no mass layer switch every now and then  
---
uneven layerpops also mean that there is the "right" layer to switch to for doing something (empty for farming / full for pvp etc)
---
No, he's tinfoil hatting. The reason it's more popular is because people got used to pserver dungeons which were tuned to be more difficult than classic ones.
---
You misquoted it lol
---
I am aware. It's the very same cinematic that Chris Metzen, *the* lore authority and creative director for vanilla WoW, did not want, but was veto'd by the rest of the team in favor of a trailer to get people excited to play the game. The cinematic literally shoved lore aside to instead be as marketable as possible. This was pointed out in the vanilla developer book The WoW Diary. So... it's nice fluff, but how are we to interpret this? By what metric are the "drums of war" from an unknown narrator compared to the words of characters who live and breathe in the game we play?
---
Blizzard has always had a history of setting aside the lore in order to facilitate gameplay. The fact that the night elves joined the Alliance despite having little reason to do so. The fact that the Forsaken were given the *flimsiest* excuse of joining the Horde when they really shouldn't have been accepted at all. No dwarf mages in order to maintain class equality between the factions. The existence of battlegrounds, in direct contradiction to the Warchief's beliefs. Mages losing invisibility for being too strong. The zones are clearly much smaller than the true Azeroth. All of these were gameplay-based decisions that sidestep the lore. They wanted to make a good game based in Azeroth, but as a result, it became a warped reflection of Azeroth that isn't exactly right.
---
People complaining about "increased deadzone" making melee opponents OP, even though 1. leeway shrinks the deadzone because your range is extended, and 2. melee character don't care about deadzone abuse, they want to be in melee range.
---
They have made no changes to dungeon XP from Vanilla to Classic.
---
Pservers gave the spergs the notion that dungeon leveling wasn't efficient, for a while they thought Blizzard had even nerfed elite damage, but it turns out they were full of shit.
---
And then all the streamers went from 30 to 40 never leaving SM and remembered that Joana the "record holder" refused all groups and now they're starting to understand his mistake.
---
In what way do you want this sub to be like that one? Incels just circle jerking? Oh yeah can’t wait.
---
When you play too much PoE...
---
Spriests in raiding are always bad. Terrible mana issues early on, and terrible scaling from gear later on. Healers hate having to keep up shadowweaving and having a gimp spec though so it's not too hard to get a spot (1 per raid max), because warlocks are very gimped with no shadow weaving. You're not brought for personal dps though.  
---
  
---
Spriests are ok but not great in group pvp. Spriests has poor range, vulnerable to offensive and defensive dispel, and not great burst damage. Particularly on horde where priest is the only good pvp healer and every group will be desperately after priest heals, everyone will just roll their eyes if you tell them you're shadow. Similar on alliance side for ret pallies - it's not that ret is that bad, but it's very poor when compared to a holy pally everyone is desperate for.
---
It's because you guys are ridiculous. Sure, right click reporting a hassle. It sucks. But, the alternative is what you immature shits bring upon us. Pservers are absolutely disgusting. New players won't even want to play the damn game. Anyone asks a question, they are humiliated and told to basically kill themselves. The internet is so toxic without regulations, and nobody is honestly going to fill out online reports. 
---
If you don't want right click reporting, remember that the next time you talk about N words, lynching, wishing Cancer, autism, school shootings, Jews burning, and anything else that's basically common conversation now. 
---
Maybe if you don't act like a child, you won't be treated like one.
---
....good luck getting past Magmadar guy
---
Maybe he was being rude because you called him a fat 15 year old
---
I don't participate in in-game chat. Nothing someone says online bothers me. But, they ruin it for me because right click reporting is the only way to make sure it isn't a cess-pool. It's unfortunate, but Idk what you expect. Go on a Pserver for 30 minutes and tell me that's "fine".
---
Yeah because children are debating politics.. not the 30 year old incels...
---
so, you say xp values per mobs on pservers are the same as beta, but mobs were harder?
---
I'd suspect it occurs when collapsing layers when the number of people drop below a threshold.
---
Creating a layer should only be needed during launch because of an influx of new people, that means it should fill relatively quickly just from people logging in.
---
People don't realise that classic wasnt hard, people just didn't have 15 years of experience in the game
---
Viewers cause the problems mate. You’re blaming one person for the actions of hundreds or thousands.
---
Getting my current retail guild to read guides is just as much of a problem, things haven't changed as much as you seem to think :p
---
So like real life?
---
On beta compared to the pserver I played I can get 4 shots off on my hunter before they’re in my dead zone/melee range compared to only 2 or 3 on the pserver. It does not appear that fighting mobs has a disadvantage and I’d say if anything it’s easier to kite on beta.
---
Ask around on here, guarantee there are people who would love to level with you. I'm going Alliance but I know there are Horde warriors who would love to have a shaman buddy while leveling, classic seems like a good place to make new friends, might as well start now!
---
My old guild was led by a couple, their 30 year old son was an officer. It was pretty casual but they were solid.
---
is it 50per turn in? i thought 75... damn now my whole plan is messed up. thanks for the headsup
---
Locks are great in PvP no matter the gear level. 1v1 you probably won't be able to do much damage without a good amount of haste but you have so much utility and CC that you can be a huge benefit to a group even with shit gear.
---
mob XP on Pservers is generally wrong. 
---
and elite is worth x2 xp of a normal mob
---
a dungeon elite is worth 2.5 exp of a normal mob
---
pservers typically dont give you the extra x0.5   
---
also it seems that mobs on classic dont seem to be as rapey as pservers or what people remember from vanilla.
---
It was something people did in tbc for sure.
---
No one really did it in classic because it requires 5 ppl.
---
Literally!
---
Where is he tho
---
The beta is correct, pservers are generally wrong.
---
Even worse, you now need even more distance between you and the melee before you can activate aspect of the cheetah to escape or kite. Hunters will be dazed for days....
---
&gt; essential for raid progression
---
essential for *some* raid progression, exclusively to the early phases.
---
And they're still a meme class. Unless there's a dispellable rage mechanic, the only reason you bring a single hunter is so loot doesn't rot. And even then the Nexus Crystals are more valuable.
---
You can only be in one channel on one server as far as I can tell. I know servers in GW2 still use Teamspeak3 for WorldvsWorld because it's more robust for managing huge groups of people. (100+)
---
But they cant keep layers Equal Without frequent layerings If they create/destroy layers dynamically.
---
That its a different thing that what I'm talking about.  I'm trying to prove the xp is wrong, if it is.  Your anecdote is not helpful in multiple ways.  1.  It's an anecdote.  2. It would be impossible to compare what you did to the beta even if you had a video.
---
Thanks. 
---
Yeah I tried to get into it with a free trial with the first expansion and it wasn't very fun. 
---
I heard the game gets a lot better.
---
as far as i know you dont get repeatable rep from any quest other than the cloth turnins. at least not pre cloth turning quest patch in classic.
---
if you would be so kind try it on the beta and report back
---
Thats helpful, thanks.
---
Hence why I used the word *aggressive*.
---
Unless you knew how to avoid it, Layering was quite frequent on the last stress test and the large population swings of the beta.
---
I have never been silenced in World of Warcraft since the feature of right click reporting has been released. During this time I have had fun in trade chat and general chats, but I tend to avoid topics that would most likely get you in trouble. 
---
I agree it makes it a bit too easy to report, but as long as you follow the ToS you should be fine. Also didn't they remove the automated part and now it's pending GM review?
---
Except blizzard explicitly does not seperate microtransactions from subs because that would reveal sub counts. Blizzard gives out net revenue amounts which include subs, microtransactions and product sales all together in one number. You can only guess where the split on those different incomes fall.
---
I'll end up in Rehab from the leeway deaths.
---
Just the old WoW log in screen music
---
Yeah had a raid leader like that once. Keeping it lighthearted is nice, but cracking jokes after wiping to the same mechanic for the 50th time won't go over well with most people.
---
I'm able to have fun chats on current realms. RP servers in particular since we can discuss lore. I feel as long as you keep it Warcraft related you should be fine.
---
Hammerfall and nightwish
---
Hope they Decide on the right Thing. Frequent layering could Impact the experience Just as much as empty worlds imo
---
I'm telling you the pserver crowd got used to something that wasn't correct, I have no idea what their values were.
---
Linkin park :(
---
The healers should be like, more good and stuff so we can bring another DPS instead of a tank.
---
Pleasant fellow huh? What a fuckhead
---
I get that, but the Beta is nearly done....it seems like right now above all other times is important to bring this stuff to light.
---
Terrible levelling unless you’re just dungeon grinding, or always grouped. Fine at 60. Small dps loss but much less weapon competition and good for pvp.
---
Dps is similar tbh, daggers are just much more work then  autoattacking with SnD
---
Yes, that's total net bookings, not in-game net bookings. And that's not the total earnings call, just the top sheet the SEC requires, there's not even a link to board meeting minutes.
---
Here's some links to dumb it down for you, which still don't have all the numbers breakdown but at least know how to write to a 3rd grade reading comprehension:

Looks good!
---
if all they do is cause problems, and they're easily circumvented by just not playing with them, why are you still bitching?
---
[I think I know why](https://youtu.be/J6oTIjvw_-8?t=28)
---
I actually enjoy the ego-stroking for what it is. I just wish it was even mildly consistent with itself. One moment I’m the mightiest mage to have ever lived, capable of taking down a titan almost singlehandedly, and having ended the cosmos-ending legion of demons. The next I’m off to go kill some pigs to make a village happy. Like yes I’m doing something important, but they couldn’t have sent someone else to go kill those pigs? Clearly I need to be killing pigs for gameplay purposes, but the fact that we alone did some of the boss fights was a crucial mistake IMO. Everyone bitched about Thrall stealing our Deathwing kill but at least it meant we went into MoP feeling like heroes, not nascent demigods. More of that would’ve preserved the feeling of heroes vs gods, I think.
---
Yes its tree of life, so the BC patch right before TBC came out???
---
No, I mean many talents are boring stat increases. The only tough choices you have to make are a small handful of cooldowns. Some classes have no real choice in the matter.
---
The old talents on release were even worse. Laughably bad.
---
With all the hunters and warriors taking my loot  I wonder if I'll get a set of felstrikers before dal rends
---
I would only beat him this way just to hear him bitch even more about it.
---
The clip is almost two weeks old.
---
I attack your life points directly!
---
Yeah I know they are amazing for PvP. I was just curious about PvE as well.
---
Judging from all your other comments you have some intense hatred for hunters. 
---
What hunter hurt you?
---
You can grief RPers without killing them. You can grief your own faction members.
---
Unfortunately, the Beta has been capped at level 40, and is shutting down on 7/12, so I can’t test out those repeatable turn-ins. Perhaps we’ll have a chance to test them out during the stress test on 7/25.
---
It's absolutely true that non-subscription sources are the majority of revenue now.
---
In monopolistic situations, it is always more profitable to produce fewer times at higher prices than the optimal non-monopolistic price. Maybe that is similar to what is happening here, Blizzard is making more off WoW now, even though there is a lot less interest or active subscriptions.
---
That said, I find that unlikely. Id' be willing to bet that WoW was more popular from Classic to WOTLK than it is now.
---
The attitude that you just kick people who don’t get along with others or have the wrong attitude. No humming and hawing, just do it.
---
Some bad companies/bosses don’t understand that keeping poor performers in the hope of keeping attrition low actually make the good performers unhappy and leave. 
---
In wow I’d much rather keep a poor player who was a great person who everyone liked, so it’s not a great analogy. So the bad performance in wow is really how people behave toward each other.
---
if you plan on pushing to 60 asap its worth gettung a likeminded guild now, or at leastafter realm announcement. if you don't why rush?
---
Nice.  This should be top comment.
---
No cell phones. Just NPCs living in the moment.
---
Blizzard designed Hunters without realizing they were absolutely useless in end-game content until it was too late, so they added a book that drops from the first raid boss to give Hunters a single point of value for a few encounters. And then they stopped caring even about that, giving guilds full permission to kick all Hunters and leave them out in the cold, where they belong.
---
Desolace/Feralas
---
Mages have blue ice in a raid
---
Smiletron
---
Not getting psychic scream rank 1 would be super galaxy brain. That’s like avoiding getting one of the best cc’s in the entire game to save 15 silver.
---
if not, a few k into revered at 40 is already a big leap and saves a lot, a fucking shittone, of runecloth anyway :)
---
DId you even read the 4 articles you linked? All four of those are micro-transactions across all Activision Blizzard platforms, not just wow. 
---
And to pull a few quotes from those articles you just listed. 
---
&gt; These figures represent quarterly and annual records for Activision Blizzard. 
---
&gt; It’s important to remember that Activision Blizzard owns King, the company behind a series of mobile games including Candy Crush, all of which have a big focus on microtransactions 
---
&gt; This money is accumulated from various content such as in-app purchases, DLC sales, and loot boxes. [Analyst Daniel Ahmad tweeted](https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/961721533407399938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Factivision-blizzard-made-4-billion-on-microtransac%2F1100-6456669%2F) that about half of that revenue came from King, the company behind Candy Crush, while the rest is from its various properties, including content from Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Hearthstone. 
---
&gt; The bulk of that amount is delivered via King and its Candy Crush games, Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga, which were number one and two among the top-ten grossing games on the iOS and Android app stores in 2017.  
---
Thanks for proving my point for me.
---
What irritates me is when you clearly are joining a massive raid to tackle these world-threatening enemies, but the narrative treats it like you did everything singlehandedly. Did you not see the other 19 people fighting bac there?
---
Sounds sweet, post a link to the stream and bracket details once all set up
---
I just want a guild that doesn’t have some arcane loot distribution system.
---
Seems like a huge huff for Mages
---
A name that everyone you interact with knows you as.
---
Game-wide name exclusivity would be a good solution to this problem.
---
But you don't have to focus on farming soulshards get them while farming something else store in bank or something. Now buffing yourself as lock after death is a big turn off for myself.
---
“You’re welcome!”
---
Gotcha. And because of this casters with no melee feels they get a bad deal here.
---
Is that really it? You're joking? You need some help bro.
---
Or they won't. All depends on when Blizzard is confident in their ability to convert Classic players over to Retail, which they want because that's where all the money is.
---
On my server is was lower case dm for deadmines. Never saw VC.
---
Yeah, Wowhead comments from before 2.0.1 (which seem to be the most accurate source of reputation gains currently) all say 50: [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7801/additional-runecloth#comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7801/additional-runecloth#comments)

Don't worry, no one is going to copy this.
---
I'm way too fidgety with my feet for that.  Logitech G35 headsets have been everything I need, I have a stock of extras for when I inevitably break them (earmuff breaks off after ~5 years of heavy use, they'd probably last 15+ years if I was super delicate with them all the time.
---
You just need about 3 stacks of linen cloth and your set
---
Dagger spec early on lacks cheap shot and kidney shot to be useful so you are stuck with gouge &gt; recover energy &gt; backstab. So yeah SS is the way to go.
---
Later on you can open cheap shot Backstab wait till full Gouge ..... backstab .... 5 points ..... if mob is low do Evis if not wait till full energy and kidney for a couple of more backstabs wait gouge backstab Evis. 
---
As you can see a complex rotation, with SS you just spam SS, keep slice and dice up and evis or rapture or kidney

Which one is the old? I like the top picture better

And you're not a melee hunter. You melee weave. You already have enough range ability to snipe without aimed shot. But you can survive in close enough to root melee or jump in and out of ragend/melee when your instants are up

I do deal with it, I don't give a fuck what you punks say online. I don't even bother with chat. However, I might actually talk in chat if 9/10 answers to a question weren't belittling or toxic as fuck to the person who asks it. No I'm not gonna fucking cry because one of you little pussies says something to me, but it's just not worth my time to even put myself in that position.
---
Again, I never said this system is great. It's the alternative to a free-for-all slur/racism filled chat. You really haven't played any popular Pserver if you're gonna sit here and say it isn't toxic. Its insanely toxic, and for no reason. 
---
And yes, there are people who get offended by this. You aren't some manly guy who determines everyone else is soft because something someone else says to them bothers them. Those people shouldn't have to feel that way because you can't keep your keyboard warrior mouth shut.
---
Been playing on a pserver. I thought that over the years, the huntard problem would get a bit less severe. Now I'm convinced you have to sign a waiver to play a hunter that states you are indeed  mentally handicapped.
---
No.
---
He’s just overall the most negative, contrarian, know-it-all person on this sub. It’s sad.
---
“How do you kill that which has no life?”
---
You can tell it’s patch 2.0 because you can see hunters on the dps meter (also because spell stats in character screen).
---
Yikes.
---
Are you obtuse? I'm pointing out how right click report and auto-squelch CAN and WILL be abused by many.
---
Yeah, I enjoy min maxing, its how I have fun.  You have fun other ways, you don't see me knocking your way of enjoying the game.  Its a big world, we can all have fun in our own ways.
---
Honestly, I min max because I don't have as much spare time.  I can't log in for 14 hours a day, I'm lucky if I get 1-2 hours on a weeknight.  I can't throw myself at a boss for 200 wipes for progression, but I can log in to snag world buffs, sit on them half the week on my raiding character, then come in and raid Friday/Saturday night for 2 hours and blast through content full buffed/consumabled with a like minded group.
---
I'm passionate about all things. In a conversation about ants, you might think that I have an intense hatred for ants, but I don't. We just happened to be talking about ants.
---
It's the same with hunters. They're as significant to me as ants. You only think about them in large numbers and only then when they want your hard earned spoils that they did nothing to deserve.
---
Gib sticky yellow crits.
---
* Pets don't scale. A full T3 hunter's pet will do the same damage as a naked 60's pet (minus the 50 AP the pet gets from the T3 set bonus). Pets make for 20-30+% of a hunter's DPS during MC/BWL and still do 10-15% of a hunter's DPS in Naxx.
---
* Lack of weapon upgrades. Your weapon progression is Rhok'Delar--&gt;Ashjre'Thul (BWL xbow)--&gt;Nerubian Slavemaker (Naxx xbow from KT). Ammo is also the same from start to finish, no scaling whatsoever.
---
* Lack of overall gear upgrades in the later tiers. You get barely anything from AQ40 (our tier set gives us spell power for arcane shot, seriously wtf) while other classes get massive upgrades. You have to compete with healers for your tier tokens in Naxx, so you're usually behind them in terms of priority.
---
Hunters can manage to top the meters in MC and get pretty close to that in BWL, but they start falling off during AQ40 and are behind the other DPS in Naxx. They're not "barely above the tank" levels of poor damage, but they aren't able to compete with a mage/warlock/rogue that is equally competent.
---
You should collaborate with the author of the census addon and see if you can agree on a shared data structure.
---
Means you can skin a dead bear for thick leather.
---
Lol probably what it was.
---
....2nd raid boss 😏
---
&gt; Natural evolution will probably ensure that not everyone has meme specs.
---
Or the end goal is being able to have a full meme spec raid. 
---
"We've just got to follow the meta until we get well geared, then we can do whatever we want wit the easier raids!"  
---
A competitive/pragmatic raid guild with the end goal of doing mainly meme spec raids would be cool.
---
Hunters would have been fine in classic if the team responsible for loot didn't fall asleep behind the wheel lol. Seriously, 3 weapon upgrades across 3.5 tiers and a spell power set? Lol.
---
if ur in zerker u can use it while feared
---
I think you overestimate what people consider "casual".  The game got to the point its at on retail with LFR and such because people want to log in for an *maybe* an hour, and still feel like they accomplished something (1 LFR wing cleared, 2 heroics through LFD, handful of world quests, etc).  They might not even log in 2 nights a week, they might only log in on Saturdays for 3 hours the entire week.
---
Not saying they should be catered to at all, but those are the masses that drove Blizzard to send the game in the direction it took.  I can't really see that type of player finding enjoyment in Classic, but who knows, it could be like a 2 year long massive journey to 60 for them and they enjoy every minute of it, who knows.
---
No. The Tome of Tranquilizing Shot drops off Lucifron, the first raid boss of Molten Core. It is needed for Magmadar, the second raid boss of Molten Core.
---
Coheed and cambria, all three of their first albums. Back then there was a rumor that running windows media player opened up a bit more of your system for wow to access resources. I dont know if it was true or not, but I had the first three coheed albums burned into WMP. So I always turned it on while playing.
---
He has one until classic comes out!
---
This annoys me most, always has, through all expansions. Everyone is running to MOVE YOUR ARSE.
---
It's Blizzdrones in general. Doesn't matter the game.
---
These people would eat Blizzard's shit, as long as it comes stamped with their logo on it.
---
AFAIK the addons just watch the combat logs to detect spells being cast, it's not doing it through api. If the caster stops, the addon doesn't know. I'm not sure it can tell you the rank or how long the cast time really is either (could be talented or different rank).
---
Exactly, I don't wanna be on someone else's schedule before I even create a character.
---
Would be cool if that shard was named if you killed a player, and only became generic if you added it to an existing stack. So you could actually steal someone's soul and link it in chat.
---
But for real—ya they don’t scale well in later raids with dps be side their pet outputs the same dps as the day they dinged 60....but that’s not a class problem, that’s a design problem. Hunters are well in the middle of the pack with any other dps spec and above many in earlier raid content.  They have excellent threat control which not every dps class/spec can boast *cough* warlocks *cough*...How precisely are they less useless than other mid pack dps classes in a raid context?
---
&gt; Might deter some people.
---
Might be a good thing, honestly.  I don't really want to have to interact with a bunch of teenagers if I can avoid it.  I wouldn't want to put up with my teenage self now, and I wasn't even half bad compared to people you see these days with twitch chat cancer and such.
---
BFA is a lot more visually complex than classic.
---
Can confirm: Is fun. Get the ZG set bonus when it ships, and you'll out-range most classes too.
---
Yeah my private server shaman's windfury crits look 10x better than what I've seen on beta. I liked the huge font that you could see the jagged edges on
---
7 weeks for/of, what?
---
Sexxy Rexxy!
---
Rexxar doesn't suffer fools lightly.  I hope your corpse run wasn't too long.
---
Oh ya, that’s right. I stand corrected.
---
Ele/resto is usually considered the strongest PvP spec by a mile. The burst is insane for a healing class and comparable to Warlock burst. On top of that they have a bunch of group utility.
---
Shamans would be straight up overpowered if it weren't for their mana issues and having a few, really bad matchups that are almost unwinnable.
---
Daft Punk, Gorillaz, Chronic Future, Circa Survive, Saosin. Best playlist for WoW.
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once.
---
Why would they shut classic wow when they still run D2 and WC3 servers etc, these servers will likely be up for 10+ years with minimal people playing, like all of their other old titles.
---
I want to know what a hunter is gonna do with  \[**Meteor Shard\], was playing dagger rogue and he got the dagger didn't equip or anything just hearthstone out.**
---
I hate hunters now.
---
Man, anytime I see a thread or comment about Hunter, I swear you're there shitting all over them. Are you playing one or something and trying to push out the competition? Can't see any other reason.
---
I played this 39 twink build and the ones which evoked from it from late Vanilla through early Wrath. 
---
By the end with Wrath chants/leg armor and Northrend profs I had a 4k+ HP hunter with Max level herbalism HoT (2k) and maxed engineering. Some of the other gear changed by then too but not much
---
Cry about it baby boy
---
gl getting randoms to join a pug with master loot on, too much ninja risk.
---
It won't hurt to look for a guild that suits what you want to do. I looked for guilds that planned on raiding around when I wanted.
---
Do you really believe everyday speech is a cordial as television?
---
Your second little paragraph seems like a bannable offense, friend.
---
\+ Kara....
---
Really I dont give ashit if they expand or not I just really want Kara again. Like that ONE thing above all others.
---
No shards, sorry.
---
Maybe teabagged by a hunter in Wpvp and left a really bad, long-lasting taste in his mouth....just one speculative hypothesis.
---
Yeah, a know-it-all that knows nothing, probably come from mmo-champion or wow general forums
---
Prodigy ‘s Smack My Bitch Up for every Ony raid. Playing it over vent got me insta-muted every time.
---
We had a rogue named Tehgankzster so maybe that was him lol
---
Ventrilo had a function where you could ghost in other channels. So you would get some raids which mimicked how the army uses radio. Smaller groups that would talk to each other that also had the means to listen to the raid leader/officers simultaneously. This sort of reflected the 'squad' mentality but was slightly more meta because you had both your raid party group AND class groups.
---
Rocking in PvP is another good reason.
---
god why does that set have to look like straight garbage
---
&gt;There also SHOULD be a market for the copper dagger
---
Just made a post about my gnome rogue failing to find a good dagger up to lvl10.
---
I would buy that dagger, and while I was at it a stack of sharpening stones. Even if it meant spending all of my silver, selling all my armor and consumables etc
---
It got taken down a few minutes after I posted it according to reddit, they sent me a message saying I can't post it yet [https://imgur.com/cCPdaiR](https://imgur.com/cCPdaiR)
---
LMFAO was my Trial of the Crusader playlist 
---
 
---
Their song Yes reminds me of healing that raid
---
Yes to all of that.
---
Yes, Layers are continent wide so that when you switch zones you won't *always* get Layered. But Layers still take into consideration the population of one zone. 1000 people in one zone means 10 to 20 Layers. 1000 people across 20 zones could mean just 1 layer. We saw this behavior in the stress test and the beta.
---
Missed opportunity

You know you can't be lazy.
---
Nice, I could play Classic on my tablet if I wanted to then, got it fully functional with movement and abilities in Retail. Only downside is I never use it, it was cool to set up though
---
Yeah, we need ants, but we don't want them in our home.
---
We need hunters, but we don't want them in our raid. So Blizzard made 5 bosses across 6 phases require hunters so we'd be forced to bring them.
---
You are welcome to hit me up if you are NA Alliance. I'm happy to help point you in the right direction.

Three Days Grace, Papa Roach, Breaking Benjamin, Avenged Sevenfold

Big brain plays...thank you, I will be using this
---
5 raid bosses that require hunters you say? Sounds like they’re essential for raid progression. You see! We DO agreee. Let’s be friends! Glad we’re on the same side now.
---
It's useless for Druids too, aquatic form grants water breathing and a 60% speed boost.
---
Except that's not the alternative at all, the old method took 20-30 seconds as opposed to 2 making it inconvenient to do for any little thing.  
---
If you're worried about profanity, just leave the profanity filter on, it's enabled by default.

Yeah, roll a Warrior/Rogue and have fun competing with 10-12 other melee DPS for every single piece of gear.
---
Against all classes except for cb/prep rogue with heightened senses you need 3% spell hit in PvP.  
---
Against cb/prep rogues with the heightened senses talent you need 5% hit. Most people choose not to take 3/3 ele precision because heightened senses spec is a somewhat uncommon spec.
---
For most PvE encounters you take 3/3. The exception is aoe grinding spec where you take 0/3.
---
Soilwork
---
WoW is 15 years old. Nobody's gonna be shook by 30 year olds. 
---
Hell, I remember one of the warlords on my server was a retired guy in his 60s or 70s.
---
I'm going to miss having a 20 slot backpack for using 2F account authentication.
---
Everyone saying nobody would trust a master looter for a pug, look at how much trust and reputation is in classic.  When you give your mats away to someone to craft something for you, what's preventing them from just taking it and telling you to fuck off?  Nothing.  If people really refuse because I'm going to master loot that's fine, but I'll be doing it to prevent the very common bad need rolls that happen all the time.  
---
If the person was going to try and really screw over the group, they'd just switch to master looter right before the boss anyways.
---
No, some people *do* want that type of behavior. A considerable portion of the private server playerbase is not playing on private servers out of some noble dedication to the high quality of the original game, but because they were too toxic to survive on retail. It isn't 50/50; they're a minority even on private servers, but they're a *loud* minority, and they clog up the channels that, in vanilla, you *must* make use of to complete tasks in the game. These guys, I think, are now a little panicked because the edgelord paradise they've carved out for themselves on private server Barrens general is in danger of drying up when the legitimate game releases.
---
If a system *can* be abused it *will* be, best to just have the original system from vanilla.
---
Alright I am an amateur next to you, my area of study in college was power engineering, not networking. And I am not denying that there were significant improvements but even then, 1/2 of latency is pure distance and that ain't going away any time soon. And I am from Europe... so in 1500km radius from Germany you cover 95% of playerbase basically. It could be a US thing, but Europe has less of a distance problem so tech improvements will have more impact on us percentage-wise but in absolute terms our latency was already lower so your suggestion would affect us more than you guys in changing the feeling of game.
---
Anyway I think of it as a pandora box which once opened will never close. After this, someone will point out that a similar thing is for melee leeway and then it will creep out to ability or two and on and on and on. I want classic as close as possible to the original, no changes in any way.
---
Some sports subs require a 30 day old account, trying to curb trash talk in the heated moments after games/series. I don't agree with the practice personally.
---
Can you cast spells in aquatic form? Or switch back and forth in reasonable enough time to never drown? I've never played a druid, looking forward to making one in Classic.
---
Damn, I never really did the math on that.
---
Assuming 5-6 days played to 60, 6x24 = 144 hours / 7 weeks = 20.57 hours a week. Leveling to 60 within two months is an honest to god part time job!
---
Questie

There is a lot of things we are permitted to do in life that is simply shitty behavior.
---
RemindMe! August 15, 2019
---
I miss legendary weapons and unobtainable lore items.
---
When I think about it our Guild was run poorly and some of our better geared tanks wanted to re-roll. Also 15+ Chrom wipes were bad times to be had.
---
No changes ?
---
Into the Ocean by Blue October and Toxicity by System of a Down are literally the only two songs I listened to while leveling in Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Till they get their friends to report you and hey you're squelched.  
---
A system or feature that can be abused *will* be abused.
---
I don't even want solid loot rules. I want a loot council of people the guild trusts. DKP is a morale killer, and the more complicated the rules, the harder it is. Any time I start doing math on how long until I can get X, I end up quitting the game.
---
I hope so, imagine not playing the game of your dreams just because some floating numbers.
---
Having that gear in the original Classic days was no joke!
---
Thays why I said they get close, not equal or beat. That being said, dead mages do no deeps.
---
hahahahahahaha
---
I never really understood why so many hunters are trash until I played one through beta.  
---
It takes so much more thinking to manage:
---
1. a pet + yourself
---
2. traps that only work out of combat
---
3. CC that requires timing and positioning
---
4. being useless at melee range
---
5. and easily breaking CC with half your kit (stings/multishot/pet aggro)
---
Since wow is a meditative game where we tend to go on autopilot, hunters more often "drop the ball" with their basic abilities and make everything harder for their group.
---
It really does take more attention to play proficiently than the average player can maintain lol
---
he must be fun at partys
---
Thanks! I have been doing this for my various guilds for several years now and it just occurred to me that with Classic launching there might be others who could benefit. I would love the opportunity to create and manage more spreadsheets, hah!
---
Not until their rework in pre1.9. Their best healer ability wasn't even best used on them, and "one reason to bring them along" for Tranq shot can be said about Mark as well. Come on now ;p
---
O yes I agree, but that doesn't change the fact this is an immersion breaking experience. It also can be annoying as the quest took me probably about 5 min extra because I had to search for zombies after I got layered instead of just killing the farm that was full of them.
---
The only thing Omen does to help bears, they don't need any help with. Between Furor, Imp Enrage, and the crit-rage talent, bears always have plenty of rage in my experience.
---
Right?
---
&gt;Everyone here is mostly cool.
---
bruh...
---
They are but there are also some jerks.
---
That's what I figured, but I wasn't sure, never know who's going balls to the wall and who's being a little more sane about things.
---
Just put in my request for time off fuck me up
---
&gt; Which means this time around, if you roll a shadow priest, don't EXPECT to get to raid with it. How hard is that to deal with, really?
---
The point was that you would get asked to roll as a healer because 'the group really needs you' and then get treated like shit. As basically a kid I got suckered into it all the time because of peer pressure and get screwed almost every time. I'm a bit older now and know better than to worry about what a bunch of people who don't respect me think of me. 
---
*one example would be they decided mid raid that I could only get off spec stuff if there was left overs, and that I couldn't get main spec stuff because I wasn't playing my main spec. I was locked out of almost all gear the entire raid. Then me stayed in because it would have to disband if I left, today me would have left.
---
I wish hunters would stop at 7 weapons.
---
I ran Uld with this in beta, can confirm that it's the perfect group composition
---
I think for me since I've played wow just so much on and off I never associated just one song or usually band with it.
---
You can basically name any snes rpg game from the 90's and there is a band or group of songs that pops into my head, or if I run across a game - for instance Paladins quest I always think of Nirvana unplugged because I listened to it nonstop until I finished the game. I still occasionally fire it up on an emulator and play/listen. they just go together :P
---
WoW though considering its been so long and the on/off subbing. I dont think of anything specific. Just never caught on.
---
Just exist 4head =]
---
Best guild I ever joined in any MMO was 1 month before the server dropped. If they plan on playing wow classic I'm there.
---
I don’t especially want to stand out, I just want the best pvp race traits for a rogue and I think dwarf is the correct choice for stoneskin but I hate their animations. No way would I pick a female dwarf i can’t even stand the males.
---
1. I just edited my post. It looks like the talent rework was probably 1.8.
---
2. chill the fuck out. As the druid, I'm the one who's supposed to be catty.
---
rad is definitely the right word
---
It was just a fun dig, don't stress :)
---
There are some quests available for opposite faction, but almost nothing specifically \*for\* the other faction.  
---
For example, Ratchet offers quests to alliance players because the Steamwheedle Cartel is neutral. This is true for a few random quest NPCs throughout the world. Probably on accident.
---
You can farm three bosses in Inner Maradaun.

Pretty sure reddit is a toxic shithole when it comes to classic. Some is an understatement.
---
Short story -
---
Paladin class leader got mad at me for not having enchants because I was broke. I was always respecting back and forth from holy to ret. We were getting stuck on Twin Emps and he said whichever paladins showed up to raid with no enchants would get kicked. 
---
I wasn’t going to MC during the week because I didn’t need gear, so alt or friends would fill in.
---
Made a pug in general and reserved blue items/cores/ect. Cleared all the bosses except Ragnaros and made enough gold to enchant my shit. Next we killed Emps and loot council gave me the diadem. 👌👌
---
Yes you can raid casually/pug in classic.
---
In Soviet Russia the dog loots you.
---
I was trying to be nice.
---
Have you messed around with setting up loot list spreadsheets? They seem like a real chore and need a great deal of excel knowledge to make work.
---
Reel Big Fish!
---
Be good and drink bg mana potions and you’ll have a spot. You can blow people up, silence, , mana burn, fear, and even heal in a pinch. You’ll find a spot.

Horde racials tend to be of more benefit in wpvp.

Heh.

If half of the stuff i read here would pop up in my guild chat, i'd gquit on the spot.

Smite, Holy Fire, and higher ranks of rezz.
---
Would need to be two guild at least just for horde/alliance. Then you add EU and Oceanic. Also, other languages as well.
---
I think it's just because fear is a more powerful ability.
---
Good points. I am.going horde NA.
---
Yup. The game got hella popular, but most people can't play the "same" game for 5+ years and still be in love.
---
Yeah. I feel you. It's late and I got hyped inspiration lol
---
One that doesnt force social interaction. Listen, i show up in time for raids, i will be prepared, i will be in voice chat. Dont expect me to hang out in voice chat when not raiding or maybe doing a dungeon because A) im not a social person and B) im always with my friends in voice chat.
---
240p doesn't count as a video, that is a smudge that moves.

Not sure if

Skeram is harder than Bug Trio though :\\

So who wins when they are both the same skill level but one has t3 while the other has t1?

Because Blizzard isn't changing simple cosmetic stuff that is core to the 7.x client, such as fonts.

that last part is the first time since classic announcement I've considered a pvp server. Still going PvE but that sounds fun. Because I like to drown people.

Unpopular opinion: I think it’s super enjoyable. Some mobs just explode for half their health with the ambush crit. Often you can sneak past everything to kill the named mob for your quest, and waste less time dying than other builds because you’re more efficient at stealth and/or can reuse your sprint/blind/vanish cooldowns with prep.  
---
Questing/grinding is unquestionably slower than swords, but in dungeons you are standing behind the target at all times anyway, so you do get to do pretty well in my opinion. You’ll do slightly less damage than if you were just doing swords, but the payoff of feeling more confident at world pvp and being more survivable in between dungeons is worth it for me personally.  
---
For me, I just don’t like the SS  or I would play warrior or something else. Rogues do it from behind.
---
Coffee will make you crash all the same. There’s nothing magic about black coffee that prevents crashes, it’s just way more likely you consume less of it than other caffeine containing products.
---
Both coffee and energy drinks use caffeine to block your adenosine receptors which makes your body forget to feel sleepy. When caffeine wears off you feel extra tired because your body has built up additional adenosine in the meantime.
---
If you were to consume equal amounts of caffeine (which would be roughly 5 cups of coffee per energy drink) the crash will be the same.

---
Nothing in there is enough to say Resto wasn't viable before the 1.8 talent changes.
---
Ya because it's adds to itself. Because that makes sense.
---
Yeah, found that the simpler version works nicely, because spamming multishot pulls aggro off your pet and can hit adds.

Instead, you can autoshoot and smoothly kill one mob at a time at range, while maintaining max mana.

Rotation macros will be super handy for raiding though :)

a video of a twinked rogue killing people who don't even try to fight back is what made you realize skill &gt; gear?

I was in TotalLosers and raided with Jamaz (actually played with him in Final Fantasy 11 before WoW came out). He quit WoW before BC came out, and not sure he ever came back.  I'm Facebook friends with a few people from that guild still, I'll reach out to see if anyone knows if he's coming back. But most of us are in our mid 30s now with kids. So it's unlikely to be the same.
---
Is there a link!?
---
In Australia at least, I hear “the 4th of July” said usually.
---
&gt; Yes, but mark, rebirth, and innervate are useful in every raid encounter. Hunters are useful in less than 8% of raid encounters.
---
Your talent changes have nothing to do with this fact, which was the entire premise of this argument. *You* started the down this path, not me. But it's okay, I would expect nothing less from someone stupid enough to roll Druid in Classic.
---
I like it.  I'm guessing I'll report at least 25 of you per hour. 
---
You want to talk smack?  Join a guild together. Maybe name it &lt;REPORTED&gt;
---
I did this recently on a private server. As a horde player for all those years, the switch to ally was a glorious change. It totally is a brand new experience and I regret nothing about it.
---
Lol you can't even make an insult consistent with your need for self-loathing.

You stealth up to a mob, backstab/ambush it, gouge it, run behind it, backstab, repeat until its time to eviscerate.  You can always set up a weapon swap for when you enter/leave stealth to equip a dagger or sword.  The best part is 1- or 2-shotting clothies when you find them.
---
I love that this was an argument haha
---
Combat casting is additive, so 30%.

Before the dressing room existed, I wasted so much gold buying different cloaks off the AH hoping they would be long.

Not using a wand, especially as a priest, would make leveling actually unbearable until much later levels. Not sure how you wouldn't of thought something was wrong.

That’s because currently it’s disabled

---
Im so tempted to roll druid all of a sudden. Been watching some pvp vids and there skill cap in bg's looks amazing.   
---
gona be tough to stray from warrior but.
---
The thing that most officers stress about is if 40 people will show up or not, so they rarely are very picky about the raiders as long as they reliably show up with your consumables and have the faintest of clues what to do there.
---
Classic raids aren't so hard, that you'd have to bench people for their class, especially if they play the optimal spec of their class. Maybe some server first guilds get pickier as they don't have any shortages of fresh recruits and getting that few % faster kill times will matter more to them.
---
But if you just want to clear all the content eventually, you can play pretty much anything you want to. Especially a resto druid.
---
In Vanilla the extra range was useful for the simple reason my awareness and mobility were poor, keyboard turning kinda poor. Was my first PC game! That extra distance helped with mechanics but assuming you have played WoW and have the benefit of knowledge of the fights you won't need it. As I got better I moved towards mana reduction as OOM spriest is frustrating.
---
Played undead rogue Orokusaki and made &lt;The Foot Clan&gt; guild and ganked everyone who got near our hideout (ravenholdt keep) to fuel the hillsbrad pvp war at all times until around level 40 something, but life got in the way and never got to hit 60 on the rogue. I came back as mage and paladin in bc and wrath, so I’m excited to give rogue in vanilla another shot, but my friends are rolling allies for classic, so while I’m agonizing over what race to play, one thing is for sure: Dagger sub build forever.
---
Do you mean GCD?  Is FD delaying traps by 1.5 seconds?  Interesting
---
I want to make friends in this game. While my current group of friends and I jokingly say horrible shit to each other, I’ve known them irl for years. I’m not going to go out into this game world and have people’s first impression of me be some off color remark that gets me seen as one of the people who unironically say those things. 
---
If I see someone saying that stuff, my personal response will be to just ignore it. If they’re persistent and being annoying about it then I’ll put them on ignore in game. That’s the end of that, I now know to avoid that person and I literally never have to see their mouth diarrhea again.
---
I can see why people wouldn’t want to see this stuff at all. It’s 100% understandable, this game should be a positive experience for everyone. But the right click reporting and ignore function the same way. You see the upsetting word THEN you take action, you’ve still read the word and it’s still upset you. Is it really necessary to bring the risk of abusing the right click report system when the effective outcome for you is the same?
---
Do you even beta?
---
Seriously dont think you understand that word, while you complain about trying to level up and doing a quest lol. You realize you are just a tester basically right. 
---
Test and report bugs! :)
---
With that said i hope they remove layering completely asap. I certainly hope to never see shit like this in live game.
---
You can bet tons of people will be "loud" if it does.
---
My vanilla guild split up responsibilities amongst class/role officers. We had healer/ranged dps/melee dps officers and each were responsible for keeping everyone under them in check and up to date. Much easier for the raid leader to be doing more over-arching calls while any mishaps were addressed privately by officers. Keeps the voice chat clear, calm, and without drama. 
---
I also played with my Everquest guild which almost everyone was 18+ already. The more mature your guild is the easier it will be to organize. So that will be the challenge. Finding 45-50 active, responsible humans.
---
Dungeons are designed to be played listening to AC/DC.
---
While leveling outside, I usually let the ambiant music and sounds.
---
He just described me so well
---
I vividly recall passing on several ranged weapon upgrades in favor of hunters in the group. There are dicks everywhere.
---
Human's aren't quite as optimal as dwarfs -- yeah, you lack fear ward for a few raid fights, and you don't get stoneform for pvp, but you still get desperate prayer, which is nice. But diplomacy, oh man, diplomacy. I've never done a rep grind that I didn't wish would be finished 4k sooner. For the sheer number of hours of annoyance and tedium you can erase from your life, Diplomacy is my absolute favorite racial.
---
The biggest difference is the amount of instant casts. Shamans and pallies have extremely limited instants (Holy Shock has a 20 yd range 30sec CD and costs absurd mana). Priests have shield and renew but these will destroy your mana. Druid have rejuvenation which again drains your blue bar in no time plus NS on a 3min CD.
---
Basically you want to avoid instant casts if you can. PW:S should be used as an emergency and HoTs should be used as preemptive healing for incoming bursts of damage. 
---
The mana management is imo the most fun aspect of vanilla healing, but other than that it sucks compared to any other expansion. TBC was probably best, with fun healing spells and a mana bar that could actually run out, as compared to later expacs.
---
What kind of pet are you looking at? I've heard that melee hunter builds don't like when pets have aggro so they can parry more. You're already going to be unique as a melee hunter, are you going to pick a unique or sub optimal pet? Something like crab that you never see?
---
##**RAVAGER #1 HUNTER WEAPON.**

I wonder if I can gouge kite mangeclaw to the mountaineers at the min lvl required for quest (8).
---
Rough sharpening stone for profit &gt; Rough grinding stone &amp; coarse sharpening stone until you can make daggers &gt; use the grinding stones you made for daggers. 
---
This could be thought of as an alternative to skinning, all those 3 second skins combined vs the time to lvl a profession and list on AH. Getting a lvl5 in position to do this isn't that big of an investment, just in case the opportunity's there. 
---
It doesn't need to be a good idea, just needs someone to think it's a good idea. 
---
"all this cheap stone and ore...I could make some money" all it takes is one person per faction and the entire server can be flooded with all the copper daggers it needs, materials permitting. They can watch netflix while they craft.
---
Or people level past the need for buying those daggers and by the time you're ready to supply, everyone is lvl 15. Same with wands, with more competition for mobs, wands aren't as needed early on, before the wave of players splits into different zones. By that time they've got access to the BRD quest wand.
---
Should we also let new players complain about how the game works tho? Dont play an open world mmo with pvp unless ur ready to be bullied
---
Basically the song : here without you
---
Dwarf seems like pick to me, especially since you don't care about swords. I'm doing a dagger sub build too, but hordeside. It's so fun. I'm leaning towards troll because I think there will be a lot of orcs.
---
Initial release of what? Classic wow has not launched yet.
---
You know what I hate about FF and modern rpgs in general. They don’t force you to choose a “class” 
---
I know a lot of people like the flexibility. But I think there’s a lot to be said for the permanent choice

My Morning Jacket’s *Okonokos* Disc 1. That is forever intertwined with WotLK for me. I remember listening to Gideon in Borean Tundra and for some reason that has stick with me for years and years.

The horde on my server put together a raid and we hit all the alliance cities. One of my screenshots heading through the gates of iron forge won screenshot on the day on the WoW website actually
---
Awesome, will def check it out :)
---
I use military date for all dates. 
---
I use 27082019
---
I use that format when I sign official papers also
---
I must state it’s the Norwegian army format. I don’t know if it’s international military format and frankly I don’t give a shit;)
---
He's thinking about 5mans or 10mans if they invite druids as healers or wait until a priest shows up. Idk bout that myself. Maybe you do?
---
Lok'tar ogar brother. All are welcome into The Horde.
---
Your guild will always be hungry for healers, especially geared and competent ones. Although recommended to only take about 1-2 druids, your guild will most likely take 3-4 if that's what's available. Pretty fun healers imo, not as much competition for gear and look pretty cool. Not having an out of combat Rez is a huge buzz kill in 5 man's when someone dies though.
---
Melee leeway being a nerf to hunters is complete and total bullshit. it's actually a buff, because now you can hamstring that mage while being outside of his frost nova range and kite him to death. EVERYONE's  melee range is increased, not just hunters. meaning that the deadzone is the same size, but just pushed farther out. you can be attacked AND attack from a few extra yards away, which equals out to be negligible in most circumstances or a straight up buff in others. People who think this a nerf really don't know what they're talking about.
---
Just watch a kill video with raid audio. They typically mute their raid stream during progression as they don’t want to broadcast their strat or the frustration and savory language that comes out when smashing 500+ wipes into a bossing a week. 
---
They obviously don’t know said pull will be their first kill. So every pull starts off like business as usual. 
---
But all guilds worth being in (obviously imo) has that sort of atmosphere during progression content.
---
getting the required linen cloth will  require a few extra levels of grinding. No way you can get it by lvl 5 through normal means.
---
I had a gorilla named porch
---
I know it's not a city or even in Vanilla (Ironforge if I had to choose that), but for me my favorite spot in WoW is Nagrand. I live in a place where winter depression lasts for half the calendar year, and it's so bright, and warm, and open (it's also kind of like getting to run around like you were in The Lion King -- the Kingdom Hearts game Lion King world makes me feel the same way). It always helps to cheer me up.
---
*Ungh... My loneliness don't subside, one day I'll be fine provided I meet somebody in time but until then I waste my time the flow is ten out of five.  The backer half of my thoughts or I wanna not be alive and I want to just cuddle up; might find me some dick to suck. I made me a couple beats that made me a couple bucks.*
---
Also pets + ledges is a fun one to remember after you jump down.
---
This is the longest article ever
---
This. Even when I was leveling as swords, I still had more of an assassination style. Gouge that jerk NPC and just sit there laughing while you get some more energy to finish the job.
---
generally speaking, mob grinding is superior in every circumstance; however, if there’s serious mob competition instances might pull ahead in that scenario, but that’s really the only way I think it would be superior.
---
You should stop harassing people if you don't want them to be mean to you.
---
ZF is my favorite dungeon. I rant that thing until I couldn't level from it any more. So many lost opportunities to complete that sword.
---
Builds character. Prepares you for the shitstorm that will be Bindings of the Windseeker
---
Duddddddeeee! YES! &lt;3
---
I can't believe people keep parroting this. "hunters can just melee right back!!! leeway is actually a buff because of that!!!"
---
Yeah melee back for a fraction of what this warrior just hit me for.
---
Everything's a hunter weapon. Including Wands.
---
8gb ram will be just fine for classic.
---
My plan is to be unemployed for a month when classic hits lol.
---
Food for thought. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9ibfx/shining_some_light_on_hunters_and_leeway/
---
I personally would replace 3/3 imp renew with 3/3 inspiration.  But build looks good. That will be very efficient, high dps, and strong heals for dungeons. This of course comes at the expense of sucking at pvp. You will never die, but you will rarely kill anyone. Something to keep in mind on a pvp server.
---
If you care about pvp up to 44, then I would go into discipline partially.
---
Yes but it takes about 400 days of being rested in an inn to get 60 levels worth of rested xp.  
---
I hope you're not in a hurry.
---
LOL
---
Remember when people are hesitant to join your groups not to use the argument "hey, I'm probably not gonna ninja until the final boss"
---
broken tooth imo is really overrated.
---
1.0 attack speed is only really relevant in pvp it doesn't increase overall dps and is only really good for caster pushback and in all honesty a wind serpent is more reliable for pushback against a mage due to roots and LB having a 20 yard range, if you pool you can usually get off 3 LB's within a polymorph cast which can mean the difference between your pet getting sheeped or not off a nova.
---
its also way worse vs high armor targets and rogues compared to the wind serpent(and even more so after ZG because of LB rank 6 on son of hakkar) since LB ignores armor and cannot be dodged.
---
Owl/Bat are great for dungeons because screech stacks with demo shout (atleast on priv servers) and gives quite a bit of mitigation esp in low level dungeons, it also does a small ammount of aoe threat which can stop your healer from pulling the mob away from the tank if the tank is rage starved or incapacitated.
---
Not sure where screech sits in raids tho since debuff slots are fairly precious and most likely using it means pushing off some other more useful debuff.
---
lastly there's allot of bosses where you need to be careful and micromanage your pet away from melee range in raids since they can get targeted by boss abilities and the cat and owl/bat have the disadvantage of being completely useless if not in melee range.
---
The same is not true of the wind serpent or even the wolf who's abilities provide a benefit even from range.
---
30/21 over 11/33/7  is sacrificing 10% damage from balance tree, 3% crit for party, and 2 other points (either 4% armor, 6% threat, or rage on crit).  That's a massive difference on a main tank and could easily delay progression.
---
You sure it's not 2 in a zone?
---
I would add Rhapsody of Fire
---
Don't think that will happen. For MC/BWL/AQ20/ZG absolutely. Don't think I ever saw a pug for Naxx on private servers. There was a few for AQ40...but it was more of a bring your geared alts, with sign ups on discord and people still going out of there way to grab world buffs, consumes were mandatory etc..
---
Do not underestimate how bad the average WoW player is lol

A bit of translation but also the fact that there are a lot of yugioh cards so maybe they were trying to save a good name (?)

Very much ironforge. Back when I was a complete noob in vanilla, I journeyed through teldrassil with my NE Hunter, crossed the sea to menethil, then journeyed through a few places dying occasionally along the way. I heard from another player of the existence of an auction house somewhere. So I got someone to give me directions and ended up crossing through a snowy zone before finally coming across the astonishing grandeur of Ironforge. I spent many months there being a complete fucking noob before I saw a member of a guild called kindred wearing might shoulders that were purple. I think this was the moment it all started...
---
Eventually orgrimmar became my true home, shattrah for a while, then dalaran, but ironforge will always be my first home when the scale, wonder and majesty of this amazing world felt almost too big to grasp.
---
I remembered the warlock curses, but I somehow forgot imp shadow bold and shadow weaving (when the second one is the one the priest puts up themselves lol).
---
Still 200 spell power is a lot in vanilla... but yeah this is probably more significant in 5 mans or pvp or something.
---
*spews violently*
---
Thanks. Because I learned to read, I just realized I replied to a comment where you replied to yourself, so now I know you're *that* special. This has been very informative.
---
Probably crying that my hard work obtained t3 was about to get matched (primary stats-wise) by green quest reward from hellfire peninsula
---
Are you fucking daft, mate? One of the biggest problem with druids *after* the rework is that your main healing spell takes a long time to cast and you constantly get sniped by other healers. *Before* the rework? Yeah, have fun taking 3 seconds to cast each rank 4 Healing Touch. Fucking clown...
---
Is this a new classic mount?
---
IIR Onyxia has a shorter reset. So sometimes you can kill her twice a week. :p
---
Don't quit your day job.
---
&gt;When you're mounted, running through a group of mobs 20 levels below you, and one still manages to daze you.
---
The only thing that could console me in this situation is knowing that if it happened in Everquest, I would have died to the mobs 20 levels below me.
---
The "word of mouth" part really stuck with me, that really is the best form of advertising, and it is going to be bigger than ever. That and all the streaming platforms these days, has made me think that classic might end up a lot larger than we think. The time investment required also makes it harder to drop off/quit imo (once invested of course).
---
And yet the "optimizing posts" still overwhelm the sub in contrast to the type I posted.
---
On another note, before spewing shit like you just did, maybe you should consider the irony of commenting on my post saying it's pointless with your post that literally serves zero purpose and contributed with absolutely nothing.
---
Why do you care? Wait... Do you still sub? If you do, complaining is just moot. If you don't, I feel even worse for you because you're obviously super fragile about it.
---
Assbringer. Now it all makes sense!
---
Diablo 3 Hardcore crusader. Just made it to 700 para this season!
---
Yeah, same with ZG. Really annoying because you can't have a set day for the 20-mans.
---
This is fantastic i would be very interested in getting a copy of this the adapting to my own classic guild.  
---
Do you have a link to this or is it on discord?
---
This. I would never feel bad about being one of the people who just can't spend 50 hours straight on computer.
---
Dude go away you're super weird and gross and no one here likes you.
---
I mean, he’s not wrong. I don’t think there are more optimizers, but even if there were, who cares? Let people play how they want.
---
My arse hole us huge 100% no homo
---
Payo has a video of him and savitz killing me like 6 times. I killed him 10 times before that with my buddy, and about 5-6 times 1v1. They edit out the shit that makes them look bad.
---
I hope many people understand this. Sure some people get the kicks out of being fast,  and that's ok. But for 99% of the playerbase, it's more meaninful and fulfilling to play the character and enjoy the ride. Dont fuck this up. This is probably the last time vanilla is gonna be here in all of it's glory.
---
Lemon Demon 100%
---
I would listen to Neil pretty much every day and play WoW. The song 'Stuck' sticks out in my mind, I remember grinding raptors in Arathi to that song.
---
Pretty sure there are better Blue Bows. 2.5 Speed is kinda horrible for Hunters.
---
Linkin Park might be the worst band in human history no lie
---
I mained resto druid in vanilla and actually never had a problem getting invited for either a 5 man or a raid. If you know how to play your class you can always top the healing meters. So base your decision on which class you like the most :)
---
Another problem is that good hunters will be remembered, therefore I do not bother finding new ones as soon as I have couple hunters in my friendlist who fare well FDing + frost trapping in combat, ranged pulling, dismissing pet without having to tell them, drinking when down to 20% mana like every other mana user.
---
Now the bad to mediocre ones have one less tank + healer combo to play with.
---
That's my thoughts as well, I played during Vanilla and BC before stopping. The parts I remember best were just figuring things out myself and using the social engagements to learn, rather than spending the next 2 months studying every theory someone posts on reddit about how to level to smallest detail.  
---
While I hope that many people take your advice, it probably won't stop them (or me) reading everything that pops up on here.
---
Stoooooop poooosting this shhhiiiiittyyyy shhhiiitt
---
Thank you! Fuck man. Honestly we should stop giving people pointers. Let people figure it out. It's more fun
---
Who hurt you
---
What part of what you just wrote did you think I needed explained to me?
---
Probably more people used to chatting online with friends when playing games. Back in the day a lot of the people were new to it and just didn't speak much. Now people are used to do it even with everyday gaming too, not just raids or whatever.
---
Why would this ever be different? You tell me what part of pserver inaccuracies would impact shamans usefulness.
---
Although having no evidence to support the claim. I do feel like looking at active players at the beginning is flawed. At the time the game was still undergoing massive growth over many years. Marketing was bringing in a lot of new players who had heard about the game but not taken the plunge and this was achieved by the hype the franchise had as a whole. 
---
Currently the player base is not under massive growth and we see mostly the ebb and flow of the same group coming back to or leaving the game. It much more closely resembles the “quality” of the game, even down to the specific patch. Let alone expansion. 
---
Another way to look at this is, WotLK was the first expansion after which the player base stopped growing.
---
For all I know it could have had 5 times more.
---
I am planning to use the white rare bat from Tanaris, for screech (= But I will hunt all the rare pets it's a lot of fun for me and feels very rewarding even if I don't get some/it takes lots of time
---
O yes I didn't mean I cared about the speed of leveling in the stress test but the same thing can happen on live if it's not changed was my point
---
It's not in dungeons, some guy did the numbers and 2 Daggers are the best, consistent DPS - But I want em big crits
---
In the American letter format*
---
The rest of the world would write it as 27th August, 2019
---
There is a difference between real life service and a server where you can min/max everything to death because nothing ever changes. Plus, private servers are still not the real deal as none of them emulates classic 100%, this is probably impossible.
---
thanks a lot! I will check that gear after I finished my coffee. Thats exactly what I was looking for!
---
Also this is really sad i have provided evidence for my point which is more than you "i think"s... You are just wrong on this. Its fine. you want 6-8 shamans.
---
Oh wow surprised I'm not alone
---
Very well thought out, makes perfect sense.
---
I hate taurens - won't play them. Even if they have the best passives in the game I don't care I just can't. So it is either Ork or Troll - Ork active + pet passive + stun resistance(increased by talents) looks awesome too
---
You're right.  Well I think you're right.
---
Will do! First time I will level it, not just gimping around. Looking SO FORWARD to it!
---
I love that detail
---
People shouldn't be given gear because they haven't farmed their prebis. Especially when it's a really good item for other classes.
---
Even maces?
---
Making a great point about playing Hunter! If I didn't know how dps would turn out in later tiers I wouldn't have thought twice about it and rolled Hunter so that honestly is what I should probably play!
---
I could also be wrong, but I think the reason they get so much bad rep in early phases is just because of the scaling warlock has with gear - how that correlates to pvp I have no idea. If warlocks are good early on in pvp they're just a force to be reckoned with earlier than excepted for me at least.
---
I was between shaman and warlock, ultimately ended up on shaman for raiding purposes. However afaik shamans have very high base damage, adding onto that you still get a lot of spellpower gear and not only +healing items during raiding early on don't you? I mean the prebis/bis lists are a bis list for a reason, obtaining every item isn't really a reality for most people. So instead of a 'of healing' green that doesn't excist/doesn't drop/costs way too much then you'd probably end up with some sort of sp/hp item from a raid which gives you even more damage as elemental? 
---
The big ticket items like Deep Earth Spaulders drop from MC and are a guaranteed shammy item, other items are cloth but since I haven't raided since 2007 I have no idea if healers (especially shamans) are bumped down a prio slot for those items when they undoubtedly increase your output unless you happen to have any +healing items in that slot from before? 
---
Looking at shaman bislists for p2/p3, in both elemental and resto I see that elemental favours a lot of dps cloth, while resto favors a lot of hp leather and mp5 cloth - not surprising, but hopefully I can pick up some items for elemental as well so I'm not a noodle in world pvp and regret not sticking to warlock.
---
Will you guys be implementing Mind Blast into your rotation as a holy dps priest? or just pure Smite?
---
Why would I believe anything from private servers I don't know that could have ridiculous balancing?
---
Alliance players can't handle the truth
---
bad idea, any good guild will have a mt by now and going in without a guild leaves open the possibility of rolling on a server where everyone is shit
---
Often times more DPS is less healing required since you push through phases more quickly, or can burst adds down that much faster. Just have to find that tipping point for your group.
---
A map I made in Inkarnate because I love this zone.
---
So? Post your video of him getting beat, and it’s not like he just posts videos, catch him on his stream lmao

I was alliance, so I wouldn't know. But I don't seem to have come across anything saying equal tier geared mage and Shan being equal. Unless you want to show me some of those discussions I missed?
---
"iTs OnLy BeTa!!"
---
is that counting from the 80s or something? i remember there was a time which did :)
---
C'Thun world first kill was in late April, fyi.
---
So either you quit your job and play one of 4 classes, or just completely give up and hope people will carry you.
---
If only there was some way to play somewhere between those two extremes !
---
I just remember doom lord kazak wrecking every living soul in Iron Forge shortly before TBC launch.  Not sure when exactly.
---
They probably take turns with someone else
---
Filled my quest log with completed quests in wpl and epl, managed to get a completely full log with completed quests that took 3 minutes to turn in once tbc was live, then I flew to the dark portal.
---
Alliance are stronger pve so they get picked as much or more than horde. The server being pvp doesnt change much.
---
You're right. I remember farming Heartglen with my Water Elemental ^^,
---
amen
---
Caffeine. Catheters.
---
Un'goro, its my fav zone for no real reason.
---
I dont know if youre just very dense. Every single private server has spell batching, but the window is much shorter (Maybe nost didnt the first months of release) this is why on priv servers you can charge/blind/shs eachother at the exact same time, if there wasnt any like in bfa it would be determined by whoever has the best ms if both cast the exact same time.
---
But yeah im sure you have a clue what youre talking about. The funniest thing is everyone loses with the way blizzard has done it, so defending it just tells me you are very bad at the game .
---
I think for most people who have been round the block I agree. But I think there are going to be a huge number of people playing classic for the first time who are just bumbling along (like we did the first time).
---
Might come across a little aggressive/toxic to the newbie who’s seeing what classic is all about
---
Probably energy drinks, a bag catheter, frozen burritos,  and a lots of practice staying up for days on end. Never underestimate the power of a neckbeard trying to prove his superiority to other neckbeards.
---
Well thats where the community me, Halwin and our third colleague are going with our community, we are landing PvP with hopefully a good chunk of the RP-PvP communities that are active through discord and will attempt to drive a more promoted RP environment there.
---
Though that specifically is one of my jobs.
---
+3% hit and +40% white dmg on 30% of your hits at 60
---
I always listened to the album Cries of the past by Underoath when I leveled through Duskwood for some reason. That and just a ton of Deftones
---
Some of them def would stab themselves for 2 % crit, but as far as fun goes they are probably having more fun than most. They get so obsessed with things like gaining just a little bit more power or doing something perfectly. I mean shit they get excited about their 200th clear if its faster than their old record.
---
People have fun in different ways and as long as you aren't being a dick head to others that's fine. You calling it a mental illness is you being a dick head. Assholes come in elitist and casual shapes.
---
I'd argue the inverse, Grinding with some questing, especially when quest mobs are getting camped / waiting 5 minutes for respawns.
---
But if you're alone on a server, Questing with some grinding would be best.
---
Make sure you leave some leeway on the bottom layer since it will be weighed down the most.
---
Of course they do. Blood Legion members were abusing adderall all throughout Cata and beyond.
---
I mean I would not at all be surprised if some of them took adderall or something but I’d still assume most just run off love of the game and a lot of caffeine
---
Thats not what the thread is about - the OP which I route is clearly my opinion and stating my belief that the only way for me and quite possibility some others to experience the whole game is through RP-PvP.
---
I do apologise if you took it as insulting PvE.
---
Also tremor totem
---
Married, full time employed... But I work from home lmao. I got dis fam
---
Fastest /played is what Joana is going for again, but yeah he's said himself he probably won't get it because of folks with teams.
---
Hm, I am sure someone will do it, but when you're younger, you can sustain a lot more strain on your body. For the release of TBC, I played nonstop except for a 4 hour sleep break and one exam I had to take at university. Didn't do drugs or took other enhancements, except caffeine and sugar. 
---
Felt like shit for 3 days afterwards, but that's how it was in the younger days.
---
Wouldn't suprise me if they take aderral or ritalin. I heard that it is often used in eSports and I have ADHD myself and know that it can help with keeping optimal focus over longer periods of time.
---
Dude Saosin's selftitled album with the beetle on it was my shit back in the day
---
We had a vote in the Hungarian community (in which the players tend to go PVP, for instance the biggest unofficial Hungarian realm was Bloodscalp, a PVP one) and it had about 48% going for PVP.

---
Also, why do you think Blizzard removed PVP server types on Retail and not PVE servers? Especially in an expansion that's about faction war... Is it because there was more PVP players and Blizz is explicitly intentionally fucking up itself or was it because majority of the players didn't give a fuck about outdoor PVP?
---
Actually, its rather that we don't transfer at all if its that late - I know within my community if its not within a period of 4 days and even if they did offer transfers for free - most people don't want to abandon the contacts they have made.
---
WoW is about the community and many RP-PvPers aren't fans of destroying a server to bale to a new one.
---
and they will laugh as they also roll on dalrends.
---
I would agree with you if you had said Ulduar had ended too early, but not Naxx. The problem with Naxx was that it was so consumable heavy that each night of raiding was more money than a normal player made in a week. To make it more accessible isn't a matter of time, but lowering the bar to get more consumables, better gear to require less consumables, or nerfing some damage to require less resist pots.
---
I think I did a WC, when the server kept crashing and I logged off and unsubbed. I didn't even know there was an expansion until a friend of mine wanted me to level a blood elf with him like two months later. That lasted about a week then I unsubbed again and didn't subscribe for the rest of TBC. I really fucking hated the leveling back then and I was pretty deep into EVE Online. 
---
Wasn't until Nost that I actually fell in love with vanilla and I've hung around private servers ever since.
---
In Hungary its 2019.08.27
---
RP-PvPers feel their community is generally more adult not just be of an old age range as age range is not a factor of maturity but the general tendency for Roleplayers to be considerate at least within the sphere i've encountered within the RP-PvP scene also they generally are more welcoming to teaching and helping new players integrate.
---
Ah god dammit ive repressed my memory of that boss... im no longer in the same hyped mood for AQ.
---
Yep, killing Drakkisath was a piece of cake compared to finding Rexxar
---
I didn't think you could choose a title back then either?..
---
Yet NPC are still asking you to do their laundry
---
At least we didn’t chuck the three elements in a hat and draw them out in a random order, small to big is only slightly less sensible than big-small.
---
You'll always be in demand as any healer.
---
So if you had the option of RP-PvP this time, do you think you would roll rp-pvp ? If you did what content would you look to actively partake in ?
---
First time over the bridge as a human warr. The goosebumps for a 13 year old noob we’re surreal!
---
warrior, rogue, or mage?
---
I know im going horde.  I like pvp and pve.  In original classic I played a hunter.  Loved the rhokdelar quest, hated feeding pets and having to buy/carry ammo.  also hated mages abusing deadzone.  leaning towards mage with tailor/enchanting?
---
Ryddinjorn.. yeah I never really got into WoW until Wrath and Cataclysm.
---
First time I ever rolled I was in college and my friend and I took some in the afternoon to try it before taking it at a party. We walked to the store to buy cigarettes and were feeling it by the time we got back. I had forgotten I was giving a presentation in Russian civ that night. So at 6 pm my eyes look like loony toons and I’m standing in front of my class talking about turnigev and Dostoyevsky. Got an A on the presentation.
---
This is a really good advice.
---
I played for most of Vanilla and never even hit level cap, I think I was 52 on BC release. A lot of people did this and still loved the game! 
---
The biggest difference this time round is i’m going to be 23 instead of 10 years old lol.
---
Hell Freeking Amen indeed :)
---
I like reading new stuff, updates about beta stuff and Classic, But I am getting fucking tired of all these wannabe freeking powerlevelers, first to 60, 1 week molten core race. Who the hell even gives a shit. 
---
Not everybody needs skinning/herbalism first while leveling to get optimal gold, Like I see 95% of the Subreddit taking them and earning money to get everything as fast as possible.
---
I am rolling dwarf paladin with tailoring/enchanting :) because I like enchants/Bag making. 
---
People are gonna mislead by how fast games are now a days. And some people want to actually take that speed to classic. I believe people are gonna blame/ask blizzard to put more and more content in Vanilla , because everybody will roll through raids/dungeons. People need to take a chillpill and experience a leveling like u did in the 2000's. :)
---
If you can't tell then does it really matter?
---
Well one of the issues is most UI from back then didn't easily identify class in raid frames and many of the videos are in so low res that i cannot tell mage, lock, and shaman a part. So of the horde videos i have found i cannot tell their raid comp. 
---
2nd people know more about vanilla today then back then. Even with the inaccuracies of psevers in general more is known about the game as all the little things a few people knew is widely available to learn. 
---
Classic isn't going to emulate vanilla 100%. I will grant you that pservers had a lot wrong (they made the game harder in general, but easier for raids.) Such as having world buffs up at demand.  Now thats not a thing, and easy flasks from psevers. Then again they also buffed some bosses, elites, and nerffed a few op items. However, none of this should largely change WHY shamans are useful. Its an issue of dps buffs, and indirect dps buffs by lowering threat.
---
Id like to introduce you to our lord and savior Bassnectar
---
And mostly because Bloodseeker/Carapace Spine Crossbow will serve you well until you get the Leaf.
---
would it have been better if you didn't drop it to fight, but only dropped it upon death. i don't like the idea of slowing players carrying it either.
---
Joana said in his interview he wasn't using any drugs for his speedleveling sessions, not even caffeine. His routine was like 3 hours of sleep, a good cardio session after waking up and 1 hour to take care of IRL stuff.
---
Raids themselves didn't really exist back in the day, KQ was the first one and it dropped t60 armour! Now you have a lot more raids although the combat skills beyond 70 still have essentially no function
---
Given it was intended to account for people playing with quite high ping and given people won't be playing with that kind of ping unless they choose to play outside their region how can you argue that it's working as intended? It's how it was but it will play completely differently which effectively changes the game. People want what classic was, you can't ignore the changes that come from being 15 years in the future.
---
Yeah I was thinking similar things
---
Rexxar has always emboddied what survival spec should have been for me
---
can you elaborate why it was dumb though. apparently the honor reward was pretty substantial. i know that being slowed and dropping the silithyst in combat was kind of lame.
---
It's not better than the pre-raid bis
---
Dual wielding , melee Hunter with some range stuff on the side
---
nah the best channel to be in was Officer chat.  you get to listen to ALL THE DRAMA.
---
I mean even with layering, as much as I hate it - and have been downvoted for publicly opposing it at every step of the way - I will still play WoW if it exists..
---
At the end of the day it will be the best version of Vanilla available. Unless you like buggy raids and shitty pservers.
---
Damn, thx
---
Rexxar isn’t aggressive towards alliance players
---
Bag catheter, jesus.
---
My best friend just finished an engineering course with a 60-70% failiure rate thanks to ‘study aid’ - I am slightly concerned but it obviously helped.
---
&gt; nobody is honestly going to fill out online reports. 
---
TBH if people don't want to put effort into making a report was it that bad? I remember that 2004-6 Barrens chat wasn't much better.
---
In  WSG and AB Spriests are fine as you'll often do some small group fighting. They do have mana issues, but consumables help this. 
---
The key to Spriests in pvp are staying alive and insta spells. 
---
In PvE bring Runes and pots. Your damage will be trash. But most guilds will not require a shadow weaving healing priest. Meaning you get a spot. In the hardest guilds you drop a lock because you don't need Curse of shadows, locks dps is never super great (save one boss), and do the healing priest with shadow weaving.
---
Probably referring more to the external/condom cath variety, not an invasive indwelling catheter.
---
Hey man I bet you were enthusiastic as fuck.
---
While leveling in TBC i did the zeppathon. 
---
To be specific, whenever i hear 
---
When The Levee Breaks i think of Blade's Edge Mountains.
---
Also Travelling Wilburys makes me think of draenei and the bloodmyst isle
---
Yeah, for me it stopped around the same age (22~23).
---
When I was 17-20 I could easily stay up for two days... then with 21 it got worse and worse and now (Almost 30) I feel like I can barely stay up 24 hours.
---
Chromie... Something is wrong!
---
Very much - I was surprised by how well written that was. Even without speedrunning the game on release it honestly would help anyone who wants to maintain pace for extended periods.
---
Most gamers have horrible diets.
---
I'm surprised two people caught Tree of Life before the LFG button.
---
Yeah, for all specs respecting at 40 is a good idea. Holy and shadow at 40 gain a lot in their trees.
---
You still mentioned Europe as a place where you get 200 ms. That simply does not happen if you live within Europe. If you don't, why are you playing on European servers?
---
To be honest i also couldn't get into pillars very much and abandoned them after a few hours. With pathfinder i cant wait to come home from work and and jump into this awesome adventure :)
---
Grinding from 59 to 60 in the plaguelands in my Troll Shammy.
---
Haven’t heard of chronic future but I like your music tastes otherwise, I remember specifically Gorillaz heavily and Circa Survive a lot in my early years of WoW though I never got to play og classic
---
It would at least mean that it will be a blast to be part of such a relaxed guild.
---
I'm curious to see, if it ever happen, wich gamers would fall if an anti doping agency were to be hired by Esports! Kinda like what happened with USADA when it came to UFC. You saw all those crazy fighters becoming very bad or even leaving cause they were scared of getting caught.
---
Something tells me you didn't actually have T3 because most people I knew decked in T3 didn't have to replace it until at least Karazhan.
---
Ganking, and other ways of preventing lower level players from progressing their game.
---
From memory it was slow cos no one did it.
---
I only used it for the 5% buff when I went farming twilight text and runecloth
---
TBH I have led enough six-man groups in other games to know how frustrating it can be..
---
You can only ask people to do something so many times before you have to shout it at them or gkick and accept they can not learn / adapt..
---
Dealing with 40 people i’d have even less patience. You can be a hardass and get shit done - or you can be a passive leader and let the raiders do what they want. I’d rather be the hardass.
---
Shadowguard may be the mops op racial in the game when combined with Blackkout. Okay, Hardiness is better.
---
But Trolls are the only priest i would actually level shadow for this reason specifically.. For the rest of the races the speed/ease of leveling between shadow and holy are small enough that i would rather just be a much better healer.
---
&gt;The beauty in this game is DISCOVERY.
---
Exactly, but...
---
&gt;Don't put upgraded spells on your hotbar bc you literally didn't even know that was a thing.
---
If you're playing any video game without examining every detail of the menus, then you're not discovering it properly. And WoW's menus are a joy to discover. They're not perfectly streamlined, but they're not awfully designed and frustrating either. They're just slightly archaic, which is perfect for discovery.
---
the thing is tho that it being a pet ability has a relatively high chance to miss that you cant do anything about.
---
it also competes as a focus dump for the pet, so if bite for example goes off just before screech is about to fall off then it will delay putting it back on since the pet will never auto cast screech while the debuff is up so it ends up being tedious to try and maintain uptime on it.
---
Then there is just the fact that you have to ask yourself if its worth it? the tanking meta has shifted away from mitigation to threat and putting screech up means other debuffs like Annihilator (-600 armor stacking w/ sunder) might be pushed off which is pretty bad.
---
At the end of the day the faster the boss dies the less overall damage you take and the less risk is involved because healers don't have to down rank spells as much and this is why the TPS/DPS meta is so strong on pservs.
---
This is of course subjective because its clear armor values are different than classic wow on pservs however we can't really know how it will shift things (it could make thinks like Annihilator even more important)... I'm also unsure of how debuff priority will change in classic compared to pservs as I've never actually looked into how accurate it is.
---
It wouldn't make much sense to sell them for a price that noone is able to afford.  
---
I'm pretty confident that, especially early on, all of the things people usually craft anyways in order to get skillpoints, will be sold for a reasonable price.
---
Sadpy beta is offline Friday, and we need time for signups. So sadly we can't really do that much.
---
Don't run it 6 times, if you don't get in on your first run go and take the staff of westfall
---
Much easier to get the hatchets though. I'd take the 2ap for 0.5 crit and many wasted hours in ubrs trade any day.
---
Hatchets also give you dodge and armour 😉

Shadowgaurd is just better. Its WotF that you lose out on and really thats just Locks. (Sure 3 min cd warrior cower and other priest fear, but a dwarf is &gt;&gt;&gt; undead as they can block far more fears than you can and dispel your devouring plague.)
---
For these reasons i always pick troll over UD.
---
MOOOM. BATHROOM, BATHROOM
---
I'd drop all those but LBRS and mara down a lvl
---
Not only that, if you pick an alliance hunter you are obligated to play Male Night Elf and use a variation of Legolas. Legolasxd, Logolas, Lagolos, Lolgolas, Legolaspwn, Legonabster. Choose from the list
---
Clever, damn.

Remember how much it gave you?

If the quests there are yellow to you you're good to go.

If the group wants a carry make sure the quests are green.

Dear all,
---
I'm torn between Warlock and Mage. I think I would prefer the mobility and elegance of mage, however I don't think I could PvP and PvE efficiently without constant respeccing and I don't want that. Warlock prevent that with the SM/Ruin spec. 
---
Do you know if there is an hybrid mage spec that could do sufficient damage without losing all the PvP power. Or is it possible to do the preraid gear phase in PvP spec (in dungeons I mean).
---
Regards, =)
---
For me its the Murlocs - but they weren’t around in Vanilla. Its hard not to think about WoW when listening to them - mrrgrrgl
---
Like who
---
UD variant i think is melee only.
---
Seems either you only stick to red and black, or the guilds you helped managed were all red and black.
---
🤔
---
The only special thing about holy is there is no holy specific resistance. The 17% base resist against raid bosses is the same as all other spells though.
---
Otherwise known as hell for alliance who just want to run Shadowfang

Sandlol was the meme for it back then.
---
He’s spewing min-maxing negative BS all across the sub. The truth is noone needs to do this in Classic and he’s really just being a dick for the sake of it - acting like two or three extra hunters is the diff between a raid clear and being stuck on progression.
---
That doesn't exactly speak for classic though - given the significant fact of serious population drop in-game.
---
I got back into wow in WoD, and boy was healing nerfed! In classic you expect to heal 30-50% of main tanks health with a single "big" single target spell like Healing Touch. In WoD you would heal 10-20% with the same spell. I don't know about the current state but it's probably closer to WoD than vanilla. I think the change was welcome tbh, felt like healing became more challenging. In vanilla, it's normal to have the maintanks health drop below 20% and then instantly back up to 100%. Not so drastic in WoD. The "panic mode" healing resulted in a steady climb over a few seconds back up to 90%, when all the healers did their best.
---
My community will be rolling PvP with the intention to make it more RP-PvP like with a number of other RP-PvP communities.
---
The way to do it is with two character and set the 2nd up for a 2nd group of professions. This is slow your leveling way down, but increase your money and eventually make up for it. But still it would feel bad leveling a toon you don't even plan on playing off the bat to do this (also you will get your cloth (and thus wand) early making your priest levels faster).
---
&gt;  tons of Crit dodge 
---
doge is fun and games until you get overpowered for half of of your hp and then bleed
---
In vanilla?
---
while there will no doubt be exceptions for casual guilds, you will not generally be raiding as BM as it not only does less dps but it offers no raid utility.
---
I guarantee there will be times where you will literally be putting your pet on passive beside you because you cannot sent it in near the boss without risking wiping your melee and/or whole raid.
---
But even ignoring all this you are giving up Trueshot aura which is a massive reason why you can justify a hunters raid spot even tho they generally do less damage than other classes.
---
Not at all, if anything those players will take an afternoon nap and wake up the next morning..
---
Depends on the weed I guess. It only enhances enjoyment of the game.
---
Actually + healing is the renew stat and that is typically how they are chosen off the bat.
---
I'm almost ashamed to admit this but... ABBA. Used to level so much on it. Guess what I'm going to be listening at the end of August haha
---
That's soil though
---
I know I Love The human zones so much! I feel like horde got the short end of the stick when I comes to fun zones.
---
i believe it works the same as on the more popular pservers, formula should be (armor - base and agility x2) * 4.6 *1.1 + base and agility x2 which should make it 5.06 aka. #3 in the post. we did some testing in the druid classic discord and made comparisons to videos from back in retail vanilla and on the beta and on pservers and it lined up
---
Yeah, I definitely forgot about that several times
---
Obviously
---
Of equal skill, it’s highly unlikely. Druid’s don’t have a super quick heal to snipe heals, which the others had. HoT’s don’t stack which limits blanket HoT’ing. Druid’s are very good as tank heals, dropping Healing Touches, with Natures’ Swiftness and Swiftmend when a tank needs an emergency heal. 
---
It was TBC when Resto Druids came into their own. In TBC I would spam downranked Regrowth’s into the raid while keeping Lifebloom on tanks. Those were the best days.
---
Straight back to video is fucking amazing. Also, Pain - shut your mouth was on my list

No clue why you are downvoted. Seems to be alot of salty meme specc people here on Reddit.

---
In COD they do, Overwatch League probably has some sort of drug testing like CSGO hopefully

There will be a lot more hunters/warriors than shamans for sure
---
No, but a member of Deus Vox (world first Loatheb) recently admitted exploiting a lockout bug to clear 7/8 BWL bosses 5x a week, and did so for a month.
---
When you can gear up your raid that quickly then it gives you a massive advantage over everyone else
---
Though I would argue that the servers were given a disadvantage against other server's due to their late introduction - when trying to develop a full community it was amazing how far they got considering they were going up against communities that had been fully formed.
---
Hunters deal more damage in BWL then warlocks, you always see more hunters then warlocks in MC and BWL speedruns

To get on "top" of other Warlocks:  Gear,  Consumables, knowing when to Tap, when to use mana pots etc.   
---
You might think the rotation is limited, but if you dont know at what % to tap. or how to balance SP,Crit,Hit. or how to handle  and controll your TPS. or are just slow on reactions and curse/banish. All of it can be seen on damage meters.  
---
And your damage is also restricted to how much threat your tank can make, or if you other warlocks eats your Shadowbolt debuff and dont reapply.  
---
2 warlocks in the raid will be allowed to use corruption, but i dont think it will happen until later. if it is 8 or 16 debuff wont make any diffrence in start since warlocks have threat issues before tanks are geared. And if you have a Shadow Priest with you from start, be ready on cancel cast and invun pots. Sure as alliance you get Salvation, so that helps a little.

Thanks that's loads of good info, pretty much backed up what I was thinking, but many points I hadn't considered!
---
The only thing I think I would disagree with is nelf  over human, but I'll be dwarf anyway, I actually like their look and animations lol
---
Unlike Horde, for Alliance dwarves really are much better than the other races for priest. PVE and PVP.
---
Humans 5% spirit i think is base, but i am not sure. Hope someone tests this in beta at some point. If it is base its just okay. And other than that well they are just a really bad Dwarf.
---
If i HATED Dwarf looks i would go NE before Human. At least you get something for being a shitty priest. starshards, wisp, and shadowmeld at least give me something to play with even if totally useless in raids. 10 Nature resist at times will be useful (again dwarf gets 10 frost which is much better). At least NEs can level non shadow like champs and join in with stealth road ganks.

Wait, you guys don’t blast off and Hoover some schneef before bosses?? Fuckin amateurs xD
---
Most Tauren or Orc oriented zones. It's why I'll always be Horde. I like Dwarves, Gnomes, and Night Elves of the Alliance, but I always dislike the human style areas and there are just so many of them.
---
So my favorite zones are Mulgore, Durotar, 1k Needles, Stonetalon Mountains. I'd take Thunder Bluff over Orgrimmar but the latter is more convenient, of course.
---
If you really only want to be a healer, then yeah of course priest is better. However what makes druids unique is their ability to change roles in almost any spec. Tank died because he stood in the fire, give yourself a regrowth and a rejuv, switch to bear, taunt and you are the tank for the rest of the fight. This is the case for 5 mans but especially true for raiding, doing dps and offtanking, moonkin heals are pretty strong as well etc etc.  
---
Bottom line, roll druid if you have amazing situational awerness, can switch roles fast and communicate about it well, if you don't have these skills, maybe another class is better for you, becuase druid only works when you can switch roles imo.
---
Could you upload a higher res loot sheet ? Can't really read it on the Imgur link.
---
Probably more for hiding and not for fortifying.
---
I mean in classic after release :)
---
You don't need drugs, just eat healthy and drink water. Some people work well during sleep deprivation others don't. Don't push your bodies too hard.
---
Exactly, it's disgusting that autism is used as an insult.
---
No way I can understand someone taking drugs to play wow, it's so dumb
---
Ohh great Oracle of Delphi - Only one way to find out and let it happen rather than assuming my man.
---
Good luck with the tournament. Just giving you a heads up not all of them were streamers, they had to stream that day so people can see their PoV. They invited the best retail players-streamers obviously since they are superior to others (Ven, Ziqo, Cdew). Next invited people who they met throught  Beta or heard are good (dueling 24/7 im front of Org/IF, farming). It would be an "issue" if Asmongold himself wanted to compete and got in since he does not give a F to learn how to be good at WoW and is much less skilled than anyone who played. I really liked THE EYE guy, he did amazing till he ran into retailers, and it was awesome from organiZators to give a chance to all those new players, it was very well done.
---
Don't invite hunters to groups. They snipe upgrades from the useful classes.
---
I think you misunderstood, in classic talent trees there was no real "choice".  There was a best talent and a subpar talent.  Same for PVP.   I personally liked classic talents because you could see your character get better through them.  But there was not real choice if you wanted to do well.  When I first started playing I didn't realize how it worked so I did 20/20/20 (20 talents in each tree) which is terrible.  Anyway I am looking forward to having meaningful pets again with complexity, etc.  There is much tedium with vanilla so lets see how it goes.
---
I don't speak in game much so I don't put myself in that position.
---
&gt;Is it only a question of using more consumables 
---
y
---
Agree, this would even create an incentive not to grind good gear first.
---
Huh I mean if it goes well in beta I suppose I'll make it an ongoing thing
---
You don’t need to use drugs, only to be in the sweet spot in terms of age. Probably between 16 and 19 and you are good to go. Everyone else would die trying.
---
Try couple who raided together, and one is the raid leader and the other is *naturally* made lead healer but she's fucking awful.
---
Because its so esay to mistske a paladin for a priest in the early phases
---
Tech N9ne all through WOTLK
---
Man this is great, do every zone please!
---
Animals is such a crazy good album
---
Unused farm plot until BfA when they added a lockbox for the Waist of Time achievement there. Its already in Vanilla though.
---
Nyhm, GiGi, Sharm  and other WoW song artists. I really liked listening to them back in the days, and still do sometimes
---
Condor meat quest in Redridge.
---
Your levels make sense if you are running on pservers. What we have seen from the beta means you can be 2-3 levels lower than what you are recommending.
---
Actually in the 1.12 Vanilla client, putting your mouse over your « ranged » damage would, if you were wearing a wand, show the amount of + damage applicable to the wand’s school of damage (generic +damage &amp; healing and school-specific damage bonuses). So if OP had a wand dealing fire damage (he seems to have the one from Hakkar dealing shadow though), he could have seen the +872 in the 1.12 client.
---
Haha imagine being so insecure about the way people write a date
---
Technically in NA its 8/26

The XP bar disappeared at level 60 during vanilla. It reappeared, along with all other UI features of TBC, in 2.0.1. If he would be able to gain EXP he would have a Rested Experience bar.
---
I dont remember for sure, but I think it was close to half a level, about 8 of the quests were lvl 58-60 group quests.  
---
I might've been the world first player or warrior to lvl 60,5 I guess! ;)
---
There are small windows where dagger can perform really well. If you have enough damage to kill the mobs with ambush -&gt; gouge -&gt; backstab -&gt; evis, then you can grind pretty quickly with no downtime. But once you fail to kill the mobs with this, then you have to sinister strike to finish it down which is pretty shit. So it's like only good for some levels, and it sucks early game, I wouldn't recommend it.
---
It's crazy what people go through. Is it even a game for those people or something else?
---
Life is too short (for us mere mortals) to sleep so little.
---
I dont think you have to worry much about the lvl. Minimum dungeon lvl should be fine. Elites are really weak compared to private servers and there you could tank dungeons at the minimum lvl aswell.
---
In Tier 1 hunters are at the top of the damage meters tho, and Tier 2 they can still compete.
---
The game becomes even more fun because now you know what you are doing :D 
---
I hope that they release TBC down the road again, as I feel it was the pinnacle of wow.
---
i must be doing it wrong. i stick with the bud. maybe that’s why i’ve never gone above 1.5k??
---
So did it gain 500k subs or was it not growing? It can’t be both homie.
---
Mages with tier sets, thats something you dont see today anymore :)
---
Farming tbc clothes in Deadwing pass
---
Can you please not talk about the same things with me in two comment chains? That is kinda annoying.
---
System of a down, especially the song "Holy Mountains". I heard their albums a lot during leveling. 
---
Mindless self indulgence because there were so many montages and videos about WoW that used their songs.
---
Well, that depends on what you want to play. For PvE they are still fine, but PvE was never hunters strong suit.
---
In PvP some of those things are really big. Getting your CC on DR is huge and to top it off people can seemingly run over your trap, so you can't even try to "skill shot" it, you *have* to do the scatter &gt; trap combo and trigger DR.
---
Along with leeway heavily favouring melee classes. Hunters normally counter most melee classes, now it might be that they are more even. This is a huge deal because vanilla is a rock-paper-scissor balance system, so if Hunter no longer counter those it used to, then they are just mediocre against a bunch of classes and having counters.
---
They still got some things going in PvP, but they might have gone from being among the better PvP classes to being a mediocre PvP class. Sure they won't totally suck in PvP, but considering they already suck in PvE it is quite the hit to potentially not be that good in PvP either.
---
Well knowledge of the fight for example. if you know there is "downtime" where you can tap. or just make sure you dont "double tap" to much.   
---
Example:  
---
You also dont want to start tap when you are too low on mana, or you will just loose dps.   
---
*Say that you start  "multi-tapping"  at 40%. When an other Warlock, eat a mana pot and 1x tap and keep DPSing. He will beat you.*  
---
Tapping at the right time makes a diffrence
---
A whole new world 
---
More like the same old azeroth
---
Agree overall, one point I woukd refine is that people who return for a new expansion and quit two minths later aren't doing so because it isn't what they remembered. It's not what they're looking for. It's been perverted to something different. The game is the issue, not their memory of the game.
---
Also grammar and proofreading, yikes.
---
I played gnome warlock in vanilla. Escape artist is extremely useful, especially in combination with the gnomish net trinket. The trinket sometimes backfires rooting you or you and your opponent.
---
weezer and death cab. for reference, i played classic/bc and was 12-14 at the time. im 27 now and intend on spinning the same tunes 😎
---
Yeah but you know what is even shorter? 
---
The window where you can be the world first level 60 class.
---
&gt;This is the core of several problems that Classic is going to have IMO. If you want absolutely "No Changes" you get stuff like this that makes the experience worse.
---
The worst part is keeping such a system is *not* \#nochanges, because network capabilities is better now. If they add a system intended to fix network related problems due to #nochanges, then they should also halter the network. Introduce intentional lag on their servers to simulate vanilla. If they don't do this, then adding the system meant to fix it is literally retarded.
---
literally ded
---
BFA is when they were removed
---
I love how people who haven’t played the game for 10 years Think they know how the game plays better than people on private servers.
---
Leeway and batching is Much, Much healthier for the game the way Its done on priv servers.
---
Getting autohit from 20 yards away while youre trying to kite a melee (cripp poison procs etc) is gonna be so much fun...
---
They were present in MoP, it was WoD when they removed them.
---
And do to promoting exploiting not due to lifestyles, level cap is usually 24 hours or so at a new xpac, sometimes 48
---
I'd be keen to see some f those play mader made mods if you have a link
---
And on 8/27, it still won't exist anymore.
---
You're getting a weird Frankenstein monster that isn't quite the original game or retail.
---
They fucked up as soon as they migrated old data for the new client.
---
I remember spending all the Honor Points I'd earned on the Grand Marshal Weapon+off-hand and then realizing what a waste it had been after stepping through the Portal.
---
But overall I just remember melting faces in PvP with my new Water Elemental and other new talents.
---
Yes but even a pure sativa strain isn’t going to keep you energised whatsoever. Weed doesn’t give people energy and if its used in gaming its purely recreational..
---
For every non-functioning drug addict exists several well-functioning moderate users. I use stimulants to enhance my play when I choose, I also haven’t done any stimulants more then a few times a year..
---
I don’t think WoW Classic is a good enough reason myself, I was more curious to find out if and how others went about it. 
---
Im not condoning use but the stigma around it that pushes people away from rational discussion is stupid and more harmful in my opinion then an educated and open drug user.
---
How can you monitor someone spiralling into addiction if they have to hide even general use from society?
---
Well, retail lover here and it's true. Each time a new xpac drops I no life it like there's no tomorrow precisely because it's "my first leveling" all over again. It wears off after two weeks usually. After that I just enjoy the "real game". It's good but ... not \*that\* good.   
---
And yeah I like BFA. Though I am not currently subbed. I like it but ain't really in a mind to play it right now.
---
It is that bad when you can just spec properly in the first place and not have this issue. Efficiency is important. Sure, you can grind for gold. But what if this guy then decides that both of those respecs were wrong and and he respecs a third or fourth time? Now he's really set back. The early game grind for gold is a much harder grind than later. 5 gold is huge when you don't have a mount, have a shit build, no gear, and are playing a non dps class. To top it off, when you hit 60, all of your abilities cost about 5 gold a piece, so you're gonna be dropping, what, 40-50 gold on skills immediately? 
---
The answer is that you can ALWAYS grind for more gold. I'm trying to make this guy's life easier.
---
I am thinking, during launch, at 6-7 million returning to WoW + 1 million from BfA dropping retail for Classic.
---
One year down the road, a solid 4 million players for Classic, and less than 700k for retail.
---
If it's going to be larger than what I personally think to be...it will be akin to Second Coming in MMORPGs.
---
We also prefer you call it a stamina stick.
---
Legion Kara is not the same but ... it's pretty good. It was my most run dungeon in Legion.   
---
With the ship dungeon. Because the ship dungeon was a blitz clear no matter how hard the key was.
---
Anyone seen rexxar?
---
I had the opposite problem when I slept so little - too much free time and nothing to do during twilight hours..
---
It really comes down to meal prepping and overall planning ahead of time.
---
If you prepare healthy meals on a sunday and portion them over the week, having less spoilable food at the end of the week like Lasagna and less durable in the beginning like fish soup in combination with an ample supply of apples, carrots etc. you really do not need much time preparing every day.
---
Thank you!
---
Can agree there but i’d guess most of the world doesn’t have access to THC Carts - I’ve actually been making them myself in Australia because the only ones avaliable are pesticide / unregulated.
---
This is awesome! I keep wanting to do something like this for various zones. Very cool
---
You can snapshot dots with your trinket. Since corruption gets 100% of your spell power while shadowbolt only gets about 85% it's good to spend a gcd on corruption when your trinket is up. The ZG trinket in particular can be timed to use corruption on the first charge, then shadowbolt/shadowburn and once the trinket is about to run out, so is your corruption so you can get another corruption in on the last second and get a big boost. 
---
That is if your corruption stays up of course.. 
---
Another thing is to snapshot your shadowburns with Nightfall procs, not the talent, but the axe that makes the boss take 15% extra damage. When that's up you'll want to throw everything you can at the boss. 
---
There are also some tricks that you can pull off like using voidwalker shields on Vael and Firemaw, multidot as much as possible when it's worth doing, trying to make sure the boss dies just as you run out of mana, using engineering items like sappers to augment your AoE and even single target dps, for instance you can throw grenades while dotting, coordinating Hazz'arah strikes with the other warlocks, wear a tankier gear set for trash so you won't die to RNG and lose your world buffs, buying PIs from the priests etc.
---
You would, until you realize who it is making that expanded vanilla. This is where they would have to make use of the bfa team, because the classic team as it is right now is not large enough to make new content, it's a small team put together to check off boxes when porting an existing game from a reference server to another.
---
Layering will be gone, for most realms, in under 2 weeks. Most people will enter normal game time mode (3-4 hrs/day vs 10+ during first few days of launch) and that alone will drop the layers to maybe 2.
---
Add the tourists that will be gone in first week, and layering is gone, on most realms, in 2 weeks or less.
---
I say most realms, because those with popular streamers will have layering for much longer than 2 weeks.
---
You're basing this on what? A stress test whose entire purpose is to test how the technology works? Please tell me you're not that stupid
---
To be honest, i don't care that much for cakes and all that complicated layering stuff you can do with them.
---
I'm a simple woman. Give me some quality vanilla ice cream, no sprinkles, no layers of chocolate sauce, and i'll be happy!
---
Pffft, you just swim to southshore from menethil.
---
And ends January 19th, 2038.
---
Just ask for classic+ and you'll get it.
---
People who go out of their way to ruin the experience for others, either through words or actions.
---
Thanks for the clarification =)
---
It's ya boi
---
Most people didn't and those that did were actually heroes in the world deserved to be called that.  
---
In the latest addons every random dude is packed with legendaries and called savior of the world and gets to clear everything through LFR.  
---
The meaning of something is fully gone because its a baby game these days.
---
Valid question, if you are not the only druid in the raid, and all healers are of equal skill,  I believe pallies will top meters followed bij holy priests.
---
Supertramp!
---
I mean that still makes much more sense than M/D/Y.
---
IIRC that's how it was back in Vanilla as well. Yea, you were with 39 people, but somehow you're THE person who slayed Ony or Rag.
---
Ragimaz attacks. You dodge. :D I remember your name well.
---
They're "available" everywhere nowdays if you know who to call.
---
It's all about that Type II fun, isn't it? Suffering while you do it, no joy when you achieve it, but a few days (in this case naps) later, you feel a sense of fulfillment that no mortal pleb would ever get.
---
I'd say healer level is going to be more important here. Especially in beta where people don't have the AH to rely on to get greens with +int gear. You'll have good stats as a druid with a few normal/green items. You could bump these all down a level or two otherwise.
---
There are some really salty people complaining about the American date format. Why be salty about something so trivial? Also wow was made in America so it makes sense they'd use America's dating system.
---
Feral as offtank is fine, but why do you insist on playing the other two gimps? 
---
Do you understand the situation you'll be putting your guild in? 
---
Ele shaman has no mana regen capabilities whatsoever. Your spells are extremely expensive and you'll be needing cloth gear and other mage/warlock priority items for a work you're much worse at, when you can actually be contributing with the only smart aoe heal and boosting melee/ranged/magic dps with wf, goa and mana tide totems.
---
Even worse, you want spell damage gear on a hunter. Do you really think all the mages, warlock and offspeccing priests, druids and shamans will be okay with you rolling for it? You are already the every-weapon-is-a-hunter-weapon class and you are gonna be even more ignorant and arrogant about it.
---
That guy who reported your thread needs to get a real hobby, imo. Spam threads are annoying, sure, but he's acting super high-and-mighty about it...as if he's a police officer or something.
---
Nah, mc they are good for split pulls, Domo you can use them to kite adds, rag you can be very useful for sons phase with getting them off healers, for Bwl, kite first boss,  tranq, split pulls and for suppression room pulls, zg, pulling sons, soak charges from bat and raptor boss, there’s lots of reasons to have hunters you just need to have good ones and know their strengths.
---
I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt!
---
All you have to do to make me happy is to exist.
---
That's true love &lt;3
---
Woah, it's a really huge difference. Before the dmg felt part of the action, now it's just like a titel screen scrolling up. 
---
Might seem like a small thing to most but I really hope they fix this.
---
ok
---
What gives you 200 spell power? 
---
We usually put all the priests in the same group as the retri on farm bosses and have everybody smite while the paladins/druids do what little healing is required. I've considered collecting some off pieces for more smite damage, but the server closes in a months so I cba really. I think the AoE potential is greater though, especially as a disc priest where you can just PI yourself and go ham with the onl threatless AoE that still packs a punch. It's just crazy mana costly so you'll have to do it fast and maybe weave in a sapper and mana pot. My favourite place to do it is on the trash packs after Skeram that spawn a bunch of small adds when they die. We time it correctly so they all spawn and I just pop everything and I'm always at the top of the meters.
---
I'm going priest at launch but will probably be a little delayed, like starting a day or two late. How expensive are wands going to be on the AH near launch? I imagine the price will drop fast since so many people will be going tailor/enchant, would it be dumb to just plan on buying my 6 and 12 wands?
---
I thought they only had separate lockouts for normal and heroic during TOC. In fact, I distinctly remember complaining that there were potentially 4 separate raid lockouts that tier. I spent an absurd amount of time standing in that room.
---
They initially described layering as being continent wide. That means kalimdor and eastern kingdoms are not the same layer, ever.
---
Not just an artist or song, but so many songs from back in the day remind me of certain areas of wow.
---
I'll hear a song on the radio or on my Spotify and it will instantly remind me of the Stormwind or Zangamarsh
---
That looks like me in a nutshell though. High on kills and deaths :p
---
Melee can always get Core Marksman without having to rely on drops. If you get unlucky with Ash drops, getting the Larvae as a hunter is totally legitimate.
---
Instead of the cure to mortality, I wish humans could devise a cure to sleep.
---
That shit really gets in the way of my leveling time.
---
&gt; Wrathgate was kind of cool because
---
Wrathgate isn't exactly a mini-cinematic. It's a pretty long cutscene... and it was glorious.
---
The cutscenes in Warlords were OBNOXIOUS. You can't kill a damn rabbit without getting a 15 second cutscene about it's death. Just leveling through that expansion had me exiting every single cutscene without even watching it the first time.
---
If you have to include cutscenes in your RPG, make sure they're for major events. Don't take control away from the player to show some dialogue between a couple characters. Do that in the engine.
---
Been smoking weed and drinking since pre-teen. Hard drugs after 14 and almost had myself committed in recent years - I went deep into a conspiracy that turned out to be 100% real lmao.
---
Now i’m starting to look after myself better, I don’t do drugs other then weed but am surrounded by them and find it an interesting topic.
---
Hmm, ye you are right about that actually. The overlaps does make it look kinda messy.
---
If you're mentally challenged perhaps. Otherwise, no.
---
Nop
---
A level 60 gnome mage with arcane power and a Zandalarian hero charm. The only problem was that you’d get ripped to shreds and nerfed by every single glitchy patch. That’s the WoW classic we will play.
---
Warlords. I just leveled through that expansion last week and it was horrendous. Not 10 minute cutscenes, but 10-30 second cutscenes ALL OVER THE PLACE.
---
Maybe there are some good ones, but I had to start skipping them.
---
Stop. Fucking. Taking. Control. Away. From. Me.
---
That argument goes for the small items. Perhaps even bis items that are barely bis.
---
But striker’s mark is effectively super bis. And it is rather rare.
---
Giving it to a hunter that did not farm a somewhat decent weapon would be very unfair to your nost dedicated melees.
---
its going to be the exact same fun it was the first time around, which is exactly what the guy above said.  
---
you straight up didn't care to read what he said, and went on to further prove his point. jesus dude, just stay on the pservers then.
---
Kamelot - Center of the Universe

Questing in Barrens
---
What are the times at which you can raid? There are plenty of guild on the Classic wow discord as well as the LFG post every week. I would say full send find a guild that sounds good. My classic guild had been recruiting and we have found a lot of really cool people and i can't wait for classic just to get to play with them and get to know them all.
---
Yeah if you like smoking pesticides buddy. Like I said, making them myself to avoid that. I can’t get medical grade shit in Australia at a reasonable price though..
---
I can show you some test results for street level unregulated THC cartridges if you want. Pesticides and metals, they are diluted with PEG which is straight up harmful and illegal in medical states - I made a post about it in trees if you click my profile.
---
When they side with the Horde they arnt innocent..
---
They're filthy virgins, what did you expect?
---
When I didn't know hot to get to the horde camp in hinterlands I used to swim aroud visiting that village.
---
Yeah I know a few.
---
I guess I am kind of too. I stop drinking any alcohol or vaping any cannabis and it makes it super easy for me to stay up 30-40 hours and focus.
---
He got OJ off the hook... until he went and wrote a book.
---
Not gonna lie, I hate 90% of the memes on this sub, but this one legit made me laugh.
---
He only was found guilty in civil court though, so he just lost all the money to the family that he made for the book. He is just a big ole dumbass.
---
They were. But they probably won't feel as hard as before now
---
Blizzard bring back classic wow
---
Sleeping.  
---
Seriously though: you could never be rested enough on a PvP server on launch day ahah.
---
like all other Australians... we tried to stop you all from getting through the Dark Portal before we could. 
---
Very frustrating.
---
I mean I get binging when you're young and stupid. But doing 50 hour binges just so you can get up faster just seems ludacris to me. Especially if you're over 18. I mean I used to grind like there was no tomorrow on Maplestory. But I was 14/15 at the time. Now it just seems kind of moot to play and especially grind at an extreme like that. I mean the game's not going anywhere. Ah well, I might just be a grumpy twat. But I genuinely just don't see the point.
---
Don't interrupt me while I'm rhyming!
---
No shit, they made Brienne of Tarth King of the Alliance?
---
While I hope this is the case, I don't think that it's overly realistic. Honestly, I don't even know what I am expecting.
---
* On the one hand the game is still the best MMORPG that has ever existed. Sure, it has its flaws, but the core of an MMORPG is player interaction and the RPG elements (class phantasy, exploration, consistent world, etc.).
---
* It is the most popular and well know MMORPGs, thus getting a lot of coverage and increasing the chance of people trying it out (and liking it).
---
* On the other hand, it is a big time investment, which many people will shy away from.
---
* Many players from back in the day are grown up now and do not have the time to play it now.
---
* We have no idea whether the younger generation (by large) will enjoy the slower pace of classic. They are accustomed to something else (e.g. quick action, regular rewards, not requiring others, etc.).
---
It can go either way really. It can be a huge success with millions of players, it can be a bust or something in between. A total bust seems rather unlikely, but we won't know how it will turn until it does.
---
True, I loved it when you PVP'd and manage to get a godly crit and the number just exploded out on your screen, made it so satisfying.
---
&gt; turnigev
---
Maybe without drugs (or with better ones, who knows) you might've been able to remember that the guy's name was Turgenev.
---
&gt;you can hamstring that mage while being outside of his frost nova range and kite him to death.
---
Wat?
---
Hence "refuge"
---
This site makes it super easy: http://rehfeld.us/wow/damage-reduction.html
---
Most healers wont use the cookie though, they are saving the cookie cd for their rune most of the time. So it's mainly melee dps and tanks. Shards are easy to farm bring two soul shard bags to a dungeon and then have two in your bank fill them up completely then transfer all the shards to two back spots. It sucks but makes it super easy. You just have to have bank alts to hold all your mats and such but it really is easy to obtain 40 shards.
---
Are not going to use an addon?
---
Catching up with the Steam backlog as much as I can.
---
Meh just got the point of ignoring the guy - funnily enough i very swiftly ticketed support who then unblocked it and then it got spammed down again.
---
Best to continue and just ignore the guy and have a normal chat/debate.
---
Gaming journalism at it's finest.
---
Yes that was on purpose.
---
oh I meant Blackfathom
---
Where's the blighted moats and stench of decay?
---
Weird Al. Used to listen to a bunch of his songs back to back while grinding.
---
I once saw a female NE hunter named Leggylass.
---
It made me laugh.
---
Wouldn't it be better to post on the retail wow reddit?
---
Depends on if you care how she'll play. There is a lot of micro managing in warlock play at the intermediate and above level. Controlling pet, multi dotting, fears, etc.
---
I think itd be smarter to have her be a healer and just watch the green bars.
---
Not like it wont work, but it could be a pretty intimidating class to jump into first.
---
I nuked the comment above, sorry if I misread. That dungeon is good for like anyone in early/late 20s. Probably 22-23 is minimum.
---
Loved this thanks

tbh I expected more than 5 mins to make a meal, mandated at a time by some other random person on the internet. Next level insanity imo
---
"Found this..." As in you forgot you had it? Man, if I had that box it would have been on permanent display in my house :)
---
True facts? 
---
I was just looking into this the other day regarding the pally lvl 20 quest. I vaguely remember getting fatigued when trying that swim in Vanilla.
---
Troll always looked the coolest but undead and orc are so strong for pvp and pve respectively I’ve never had it in me to do troll. Maybe if I came up with a troll name I liked enough.
---
&gt; except caffeine and sugar. 
---
There's your problem and partly why you felt like shit.
---
Warlock can be a little rough for beginners what with watching DoT timers and managing soul shards. I would probably go mage for her. Rotations are really easy CC is easier than managing a succ and since you will have a pet to tank she wouldn't need to worry much about mobility.
---
I hope you do more, if love to see the overall world map done this way (but I can’t imagine the time it would take you).
---
oh man those old ones look amazing
---
Is it wrong in Classic?
---
Warlock is quite okay as a starter class. Pet management isn't that bad, no need to worry about happiness. Soul Shards are something of a turn off but not that horrible. As a duo-combo it's probably not the best but not the worst either.
---
Whether it's a good choice for her I cannot say at all with no info on what type of a character she would like to play. I'd explain the different roles, DPS, tank, healer to her and depending on what she fancies go then explain classes for those roles a bit deeper, maybe show her some how to choose a class video.
---
I don't use amphetamines but I do use medical marijuana and coke zero.
---
Yeah. I guess I picked a bad example. What I meant was you don't want 5 druids in your raid.
---
What about it?
---
Different font ≠ different animation
---
Nice little place in the suburbs with a quick commute in.
---
He said for leveling and dungeons though, I was always under the impression that assassination or combat daggers were terrible unless you were 60 and geared out/had very strong daggers.  
---
Assassination tree looks like it plays itself with so much free energy and combo points and improved poisons though so I can imagine that might be what op meant, but ambush cries are all I care bout so I probably tunnel visioned haha
---
It's going to be refreshing to play a game where the professions actually matter.
---
Good on you, I wish you the best of luck and commend you for taking the high road here.
---
But in all honesty, as someone who started watching streams just a few weeks ago, it seems the people who claim streamers ruin the game are the ones most obsessed with streamers to begin with.
---
Seriously, saw someone argue that griefing the duel tournament was "justified" because the tournament was exlusively for streamers. So how is ruining the event like an antisocial little child going to change all that? It reminds me of those awkward kids back in school, who were so obsessed with being among the "popular crowd", they started acting like disgusting freaks in some desperate cry for attention. 
---
Some people are just so fucking out of touch with how social life works it's hilarious.
---
Most of us just wanted a duel tournament, there's nothing more to it. Not everyone tuning in to Asmongold worships him, or know the backstory and the memes. Seeing his face plastered all over Youtube is annoying, but at least he provides *something*: organizing a tournament and broadcasting for those of us without Beta access.
---
Meanwhile that dwarf rogue and his goons just delay and annoy, because he's on some oddball personal crusade.
---
So while you're doing a good thing here and the above isn't aimed at you specifically -- I'd wager that most people really don't give a fuck about a tournament like this for entirely natural reasons: it's way more interesting as an on-looker seeing POV's, having faces behind the players, and knowing there's a $2000 prize pool, and having those asinine clowns fuck it all up, only served to further the idea that "the other side" really has nothing to offer.
---
Design isn’t that simple. You don’t take hunters to raids for damage plenty of classes do damage. You take hunters for the utility, they tranq shot, and they kite like kings.
---
People need to quit viewing classic wow as just the trinity. If hunters/hybrids did comparable damage to rogues/warriors/mages you would never need the other classes that are pure dps. You’ll see every class in vanilla raids because of design decisions like these.
---
One pops out all over the place, the other scrolls upwards in the same direction every time, big difference.
---
Totally agreed, beyond the bridge was the first place I saw a pvp encounter and even took part in. Such memories !
---
I need my cookie.
---
&gt;	Only way you're getting into a dungeon as a DPS warrior is if the group as a Druid tank, which is less likely than them having a Warrior.
---
Where on earth do you people get these ridiculous ideas?!
---
I have brought this up so many times I've lost count (retail and classic) and I am happy to know I am not alone in this request
---
Also something that is brought up alot is "cant it just be fixed with an addon" and no, it cant be fixed or even closely replicated due to new coding I believe.
---
Please Blizz, bring back the old combat text and also remove right click reporting. There is a ignore feature FOR A REASON.
---
Professions being engi for literally every class.
---
When you say ele shaman, your talking about bringing an ele shaman to raid?
---
It’s like he’s fighting NPCs.
---
Thanks man :)
---
&gt; Probably energy drinks
---
Sugar is the worst you can do if you wanna power for days.
---
That's why you make an alt!

---
**TL; DR Knowing *when* to use spells is far more efficient than knowing a rote rotation.**
---
So, there are some different schools of thought here on SW:P, since I see it in nearly *every* single target rotation being thrown around out there. If you're really trying to level efficiently, you'll know (and use) the 5-second rule in casting, and know why wanding (especially when you get 5/5 imp wand) is valuable.
---
With untalented SW:P, any mob that dies before the 18-second timer is up... well, you've wasted mana. It *does* have uses in some situations (see below). 
---
Talented SW:P just lengthens the timer (which equates to more damage... again, *if* the mob is alive for longer than 24 seconds). It then becomes even more situational in use.
---
If you look at any of the "efficient priest levelers" out there, their use of SW:P *does* occur, but it's not part of a standard single target rotation. 
---
Generally it's used only when you have multiple mobs on you (thus, both mobs are more likely to be alive past 18 sec), or the mob does heavy interrupts (grizzled thistle bears and den mother) which effectively "silences" you while you get up, or when you're fighting a tougher mob which will last 18/24 seconds (like a rare spawn or such). Or, if you need to burn down the mob quickly as they may summon adds.
---
And alch, at least on an alt.
---
You could step right into raids at 70 in t3, you're high if you think hellfire greens were better.
---
“Way more valuable” is subjective though. If I derive the most joy, which is to say, feel that I get the most value from being able to explode clothies in one hit, all that time questing less efficiently is easily worth it.  
---
Just a different priority. To me the questing and grinding and exploring is definitely still fun as sub daggers, but since pvp realms are dangerous as fuck: being able to ruin anyone your level (well, most classes) while you’re questing is more important to me than getting the quests done faster.  
---
Again though, not disagreeing with you whatsoever, just pointing out that rogue is unique, the two builds have different strengths and weaknesses, lots of other classes only have a single good spec for leveling AND pvp, but for rogues you do get to choose between them.
---
Mobs didn’t hit you from 15 yards away in Vanilla.
---
yeah the old text was so much better. IMO it changed because the game changed and became more spammy, like fury war's having 5 hits in 1 ability all having to show all 5 separate hits.
---
You are mixing up a lot when it comes to glancing blows.
---
Skill does not reduce the chance. It lowers the penalty from 35% to a number that makes your white hits on average deal pretty much 30% more damage.
---
That will be 12% more white damage on average.
---
The chance vs 63 mobs is fixed at 40%. But you can push the penalty as low as 5% in increments of 4% per weapon skill.
---
That’s for PvE.
---
You understand that many of the people in the last tournament were not streamers? They were just required to stream for their PoV at the tournament. 
---
Anyways, Goodluck in your tournament.
---
How is that the "flip side"? The original way you reported someone in WoW was to open a ticket and write out a report in game. This usually took anywhere from 30 sec to a minute to do so most people just didn't bother for little petty grievances and only reported for actual things they thought would seriously be enforced, nobody wanted to waste their own time reporting something that they knew wouldn't do anything. But give someone the ability to simply click and report in less than 5 seconds? Well that fucking ganker is racist now and that guy who stole my node is harassing me. This kind of rampant shit ruined the OW community and I dont want that to happen to Classic.
---
The meaning is still there, just raid a higher difficulty than LFR lmao
---
You should not rely on tremor totem as you still get feared for a second or two.
---
You get the fuck out, even if he did one shot two people he had to have a health pool of about 3k. Which means oh wow someone in Naxx gear can one shot someone with 3k health when they're flasked with a fucking berserker buff.
---
Hey! I sort of leveled tailoring for like an hour!
---
The game exponentially Grew From BC to Wrath of the Lich King, it was only after Wrath that the game started to drop off and they lost subscribers huge.
---
Granted its not Vanilla, but for me its Volbeat. I was listening to a shit ton of them back in the Wrath days, and its become completely intertwined with that expansion.
---
What do you mean with Hazz'arah strikes?  Shazzrah?
---
Don't even bother, that guy is obviously deficient.
---
The numbers op want are not an addon, miks is completely different
---
This sub is filled with Blizzard fanboys now who don't care about evidence right in front of their eyes.  Not that it matters, because they are retail players and couldn't give a shit if LFG or flying mounts were in Classic.
---
The only thing I liked about warlords was the tannan jungle open with the boarderlands style intros. That was okay for introducing the main protagonists... then they kept doing it over and over and over and over for the most mundane crap
---
From my experience- don’t smoke weed when trying to level quickly haha. Muncheez = downtime and it makes you tired.
---
Unpopular because wotlk was trash compared to the previous?
---
I will be blazed my whole classic career and streaming.

You should check out Reddit’s Retro Gaming sub. Apparently people are constantly finding games they forgot about, either while cleaning or moving house. Like, all the time.

"when naxx is on farm."

40 curses of doom, chaos for another 90 seconds as people scramble to enslave their felguards while shadowbolts are fired from all corners of the room...I need this.

Bc

Whatching some duels outside of Orgrimmar and saw a warlock crit for 10k.
---
&gt; and organized PvP
---
Why is that? I figure orc stun resist + wotf would give horde an advantage, no?
---
Fast forward to present day and you can't even make anything for a profit as almost any profession in BFA.
---
Honestly if you ever get to a point where you feel like you need to do something ridiculous like this, then you might have to step back and reconsider your choices in life.
---
Cool thanks this is what I was wondering
---
 I smoke weed like a cigarettes when I'm playing video games.
---
I played on two different servers where Naxx was on farm by several guilds so what are you trying to say? Only because you are wiping in DM doesn't mean that hardcore guilds won't run through this like nothing.
---
This absolutely needs to be addressed and ASAP. Imagine if you went back and played final fantasy 6/chronicle trigger/your favorite rog and they replaced all the dialogue text with comic sans.
---
Right, I just logged into bfa on my f2p char to check this out and I agree, it's pretty bad. I see the difference now.
---
I hope they fix this.
---
It wouldn't matter.  You're high if you think Blizzard will have this fixed by launch in August.  For all you know it could get even worse.  So maybe stop salivating over Blizzard and pay attention to the much deserved criticism layering deserves.
---
If I could re enter my TCG codes I’d be up for TBC, otherwise I’d rather stick to Classic.
---
I think a beginner should pick whatever class appeals to them the most. After her selection you should pick an appropriate class to pair up with her. IMO
---
This is true, but UD also get to use Wotf to get out of another engineering backfire...I think it's the mind control helm.
---
They’ll be cheap because the supply is essentially tied to linen cloth. Don’t sweat it. You can always just buy the mats and ask an enchanter to make them
---
Legoninjago
---
Your comment implies that this is what the average ele shaman will look like, that just simply isn't the case. Maybe 2-3 people per server will be able to push for the gear that is on display here but it will be a TINY minority.
---
It's nothing special. I've had it for ages (I'm not in the beta). If you create a new account with 'Australia' or 'New Zealand' as the country that account will instantly have the option as well.
---
Hunters will use it longer. Barbarous Blade is useful for PvP, but Dal'Rends is better. You can only enchant 25agi on a two hander, making the crit you get from the 5 agility a pure upgrade over BB. 
---
Hunters in reality use this until, like I said, everyone has their Brutalities/CHT's. Raid gear is where I'd let the rogues have their weapons first; in UBRS that's pure folly.
---
Hardcore guilds like that are cancer and contribute nothing to the game.
---
What's tatos, precious?
---
I was lvl 52 on my first character (Orc Warlock). Questing.
---
+Range is almost always going to be the right choice for any class in any situation.
---
I think they had changed the animation when the numbers started getting bigger and most classes started critting a lot more often
---
It’s been available for weeks, since last stress test. 
---
Keep it updated as this is likely the client that’ll be used when the game goes live. 
---
/threadclosed
---
Shouldn't the deadzone actually get smaller since leeway adds range to your melee swings effectively reducing the size of the deadzone from one end? 
---
In that sense melee leeway is a small buff for hunters because we can do something in a situation we previously couldn't.
---
Also, please correct me if I'm wrong, but can't hunter just spec imp. wingclip and spam r1 wingclip while in melee range until they get a proc?
---
Sadly, Push the Button by Atomic Kitten (I think, could be a different group)
---
And System of a Down.
---
Hahahhaa yeah well this was close to ten years ago
---
Warriors win in tier 1 with rogues and mages behind if I remember correctly.
---
I can't test it to see, but would it be possible to have a setting for filtering class? I'd like to watch other players from my own class, but I'm not as interested in sifting through the faster classes.
---
Honestly yeah just exuded confidence
---
Lol. No, the mechanic doesn’t work this way though it would be awesome if blizz had just addressed this rather than leaving people guessing for so long.
---
i usually run my own groups for everything pre raid and state rules before hand:
---
only hunters roll need on ranged
---
only melee roll need on melee weapons
---
and will then open rolling up to the secondary class, respectively, if no hunter needed ranged/melee needed melee weapon.
---
I state this rule and nothing else.
---
Then when it comes to bosses that have either, i swap on master loot. Watch the secret ninjalooters rage out, but keep the majority happy and crack on.
---
I'm a middle child so being fair is very important to me.
---
No. You're just wrong. I have never complained about Layering. I often defend it, nor have I ever speculated that WoW Classic will be a failure.
---
wtf is this shit
---
If you want to roll everyone in PvP I’d say just roll Orc. The stun resist passive is beyond broken while facing a majority of the classes. Else you could go troll for their on use ability and proc your troll weapon more, although I just spam wing clip to keep proccing mine.
---
Didn’t Blizzard bump the debut limit to 16? If so I don’t think this will be much of an issue.
---
Teardrop- Massive Attack reminds me of  
---
Ashenvale, specifically near the road that leads to Zoram Strand
---
Minnie Ripperton- Lovin' You reminds me of farming in Azshara
---
You'd usually get one weapon which was relevant for the first patch of each xpack, while it was incredibly hard to farm.
---
No, we're going to bring two on extra accounts and treat them like pets. That way there's no one in the raid that actually wanted to roll huntard.
---
How do you kite a mage tho?
---
I played a Prot Warrior. Mostly I made gold from doing 5 mans, a bit gold here and there running people through BRD for the MC attunement helped.   
---
PvP as Prot was slow, and I rarely killed people solo. The damage output is just too low. Farming wasn't so bad, though I'd usually group up with a healer and dps for smoother farming.
---
PM'd ya pal.
---
Warlocks in pvp are a lot more effective bursting targets down as destruction. NOT slowly draining.
---
FGWSSS was their best album, don't @ me

---
That’s true bro! Stay safe and see you in classic !
---
Actually the enchanting crafted wands should be really overpowered in classic since they use the later patch version of them.  They have higher damage and dps than the early patch versions.  Other random dropped wands aren't that good compared to the crafted ones for many levels.  So you might think about picking one up as soon as possible.  I know on the stress test people were selling them for a ton.
---
As a horde player Duskwood is ALSO my favorite zone! I spend probably 10 days /played in that zone (and just as many running to it) as an UD rogue griefing lowbies in the GY/crypts. Also ganking in town / killing the FM right by the inn there. Spent a lot of time stealthed on top of that inn...I was considering a mage for classic, but now after all this reminiscing I kinda want to play a rogue.
---
&gt; acting like two or three extra hunters is the diff between a raid clear and being stuck on progression.
---
I never said this. I just said I don't like hunters so I don't bring them. If you can't pickup on this being an obvious troll, you must be a huntard.
---
&gt; He’s spewing min-maxing negative BS all across the sub.
---
You should really read my comments then. I rail against min/maxers all the time.
---
Lol that is some major bro science.
---
Free dungeon drop weapon? Time = money. How many hours do you need to farm UBRS so get both swords as a damn hunter? 50-100 hours?
---
yes plz
---
You should 100% not base your class choice on them considering they are most certainly going to quit at some point.
---
Would it be possible to simulate the text the old way via an addon?
---
this is what you sound like when you get all your info from r/classicwow and have never actually raided
---
i had no idea.  this is actually a very significant change, the old numbers look awesome and arcade-y
---
ye i remeber noticing that on retail and just felt unsatisfying each time i critted, iirc there was a macro or something to get it to old style tho.
---
I used to listen to the opening to Hans Zimmer's Gladiator score during AV. Also True Nature by Jane's Addiction while playing my feral druid.
---
Yep, it wears off fast because of how they design the game. I like retail too, but it doesn't have the same appeal. 
---
The combat is fast and fluid, it looks really nice, it feels like every spec works, but its designed for you to be rewarded for logging in consistently and completing a checklist that is clearly laid out in front of you.
---
Yeah, sure, classic you still have a list of things you need to do, but aside from raid lockouts, you're only limited by the amount of effort you're willing to put it. The friends you surround yourself with allow you to achieve more, and it rewards you more in return.
---
Classic has issues that were solved, but Blizzard OVER-solved just about everything, and they are clearly not willing to fix those mistakes.
---
Well idk about an official /r/classicwow sanctioned guild but most of the guys I have picked up are from here sooo...... yes,  yes there is a reddit guild
---
I played resto Druid initially and raided through MC.  It was frustrating being a second class healer - priests were so much better so I eventually rerolled priest on a new server but that was before 1.12.  I will not roll a resto Druid in classic, but would be ok healing if I could do a hotw spec since that would allow me to tank, heal, farm and pvp.
---
I dinged level 60 on my hunter just under 12 hours before the release, after that I spent a few hours, getting my skinning up to skill 300.
---
Waited for TBC at the dark portal
---
I downvoted and couldn't care even slightly about the speed I kill the first few creatures in the starting zone. I downvote because it's just the same old BS anyone who visits this sub has seen a million times already. We know layering sucks. I think there are better alternatives to layering but this kind of post that doesn't even propose those but instead rehashes the same old shit is just pointless.
---
Not OP but If you aren't wiping (very unlikely with an overgeared tank) you get gold from every humanoid, grey/cloth drops, and other random stuff that greatly outpaces the repair bill as long as you don't wipe. 
---
Tanks also routinely would charge a small amount (maybe 5g) to tank preraid content or reserve one of the common drops (righteous orb) to ensure it was worth their time if they didn't need any gear.
---
Take advantage of your tank leverage.   
---
I for example did Stratholme Undead runs in which I said I will take all unneeded Bind on Pickup items and Stratholme Supply Crates and for that I'm an overgeared tank which makes the dungeon doable in 35-45minutes by just pulling everything bombing it down.
---
The crates have good loot like level 25potions, grey vendor weapons which sell for 1g50s to 2g, and the unnedeed Bind on Pickup items are often weapons like Skullforge Reaver which net 5g+ at the vendor or green level 57+ items which can be disenchanted for Greater Eternal Essences which net 4-10g at the AH. These green BoPs can give you up to 3 GEEs, so just one green item may grant 24g.
---
Then you still are able to roll on green BoEs. My best runs without crazy expensive epics were 100g-150g.
---
Also due to it being so highlevel the epics that drop go for a fair coin.
---
I found an Alcor's Sunrazor which went for 2000g and Stockade Pauldrons which went for about 200g.
---
However this was on a pserver. So the demand was higher, because you had more people needing to be geared. The AH prices on the other hand were like back in the day.
---
How is classic wow not the perfect way to introduce someone to mmorpgs and gaming in general?
---
It didn't back then and it wouldn't now.
---
no you won’t see him, he’ll be on a different layer
---
People need/want good tanks. So he sells his services.
---
How viable is the 30/0/21 Ele-Resto Shaman build for raid healing?
---
I'm going to focus on PvP over raiding but would still like to be helpful in raids without having to respec constantly.
---
Very interesting post. When I played vanilla I don't recall any tanks reserving orb drops or charging money for runs. I wonder if it was a region or private server scene thing?
---
It might be because it simply reminds me of my own country as well. (mid Europe)
---
Also my first wow experience was leveling human mage. I remember crossing the river on the way to Westfall and being like "watafak this game isn't only that Forrest?? - cooool" :D
---
I want Layering. And LFG. And Flying.
---
Not every person that plans on playing Classic hates Retail. They're both excellent games. And I only started playing Retail again thanks to Classic. 
---
The only reason I'm choosing to play Classic over Retail is because joining Retail now feels like I'm constantly be playing catch up unless I put on blinders of "only do 8.2 content". Classic will have that feeling for players that join late even more.
---
Depending on what 9.0 brings and how good some other games on my radar are, I'll play Classic off and on for several months at a time, but the rest of you planning to live within it 24/7 are fucking delusional.
---
Playing a Mage this time and couldn't be happier, the shit hunters put up with... I went through that in vanilla. No thanks.
---
I would remove 2 levels off each dungeon after RFC.
---
Okay my point was it had a very strong start it got stronger with BC it got stronger with wrath and then it got weaker
---
All drug use is abuse, amirite?
---
Probably 85% of my total time on a rogue was dagger spec.  People talking about minmaxing and what builds are viable etc, they are talking in percentiles which are already over 95% optimized.  If you take the same player in a combat spec with perfect armor and enchants etc and an equal level of gear for the same rogue in a dagger build the dps difference might only be 5% or so, and at that point you are already over-geared for whatever boss you are farming.
---
If you are in a guild where everyone is  racing to 60 and trying to down onyxia the first try 3 werks in, then yes you would be foolish to ignore combat spec.
---
If you like big crits and pvp and still being easily capable of clearing the same content as number 4 dps vs number 3, you can spec however you find most fun.
---
Kek.  Classic wow is back.  Pm me for tips man.
---
as someone who played this weird Murloc game on a flash game site where all battles took place in Elwynn, it was amazing for me too. As a Horde I always end up doing Deadmines fairly early (partly for my Rogue gang Defias mask).
---
There wasn't any advocating for the use of drugs in the BL post. I don't believe that there is any advocating for the use of amphetamines in current world first races. People are going to use them, but that applies to every activity with a time crunch. Lawyers finishing up a proposal, med students studying for exams, etc.
---
Nah I'm in EU. Appreciate the offer though!
---
Layering has definite downsides, but I have yet to see a suggestion that didn't have as bad or worse downsides.
---

---
I don't mind the posts showing up.  Blizzard needs to see that layering is not appreciated by the base.  I agree proposed solutions will help though.  What really bugs me for example is how those massive world battles will basically start becoming limited to one raid vs one raid, because getting in the later will be a nightmare when a CTA goes out.   I just wish there was a provided solution, but I really believe there isn't one for that.  It is what it is.
---
Again, you can use a feral tank (I'm even going to be maining Feral OT) but to say it's required is a lie.
---
Or both would be good...
---
As you said, we all know the alternatives.  My preferred alternative is server clusters.
---
Believe me man, I'd rather be posting about anything else, but I truly believe the detrimental effects of layering sill be worse than anyone thinks.
---
Looking for ideas on what Ally Class I should play with my friend whos going mage/Lock. We want a fun leveling experience and I want to play a Strong Hybrid clas for pvp. Was thinking druid, but curious if Priest or Pally have a good hybrid spec that anyone would suggest,
---
The 1.12 PvP objectives did nothing whatsoever. The buffs just weren't major enough to be bothered by in the first place. The scale of the fighting area is essentially too big, given that it basically comprises of the entire zone. The EPL one where you can just run between towers and endlessly piss off the other faction even if they have more people.
---
And that's another problem, given that it's out in the world there is no participation limit/requirement, meaning that if its popular the outnumbered faction just gets dominated. If it isn't popular you just have like 1-3 people doing it at any given time and nobody feels inclined to join since there's only 1-3 people doing it. You never get out of that loop.
---
If you want to WPvP you should just go to the places where people are actually incentivized to go to for actual reasons, meaning good places to farm or enter dungeons/raids.
---
I like how cone of cold had the honor to be key binded while the others in the bottom left action bar don't.

At least, limit the sharding or layering to the first two starting zones for each race. Westfall for example would be layered, but stranglethorn would not be.
---
This is exactly how I felt in bfa. They play you up to be some amazing champion but then you are forced to do menial bullshit like take pictures, or spray down some bugs with bug spray.
---
You are completely correct in saying that they fucked up by allowing the player to singlehandedly take down powerful foes. Also what is up with magni singling me out for saving azeroth when he has at least 50 other adventurers around him at any given time? It makes sense that magni would build an army of players to help heal azeroth, but the game makes it seem like you are the only one. Like you are the one who has THE heart of azeroth when in reality magni is just giving them out free with every happy meal.
---
Well he should be leveling a solo character also.
---
I would totally take a TBC server as well.
---
Caffeine is a drug.
---
&gt;  You’ll see every class in vanilla raids because of design decisions like these.
---
Except rogues and DPS warriors.
---
Other than DPS, rogues only bring disarm trap for BWL. DPS warriors only bring DPS. Battle/demo shout can be done by prot warriors.
---
These two are only brought for their DPS in 99% of situations.

[Wowwiki - Loot Council](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_council)
---
TL;DR : Basically the Officers/Class Leaders of a guild will take a look at what drops in raids, and decide who gets it, normally based off performance of players.
---
Not a bad system and what I personally swear-by; but can be pretty piss-poor in the wrong hands.
---
&gt;	The main problem that I hear over and over is that in coordinated pvp the enemy team will be dispelling and cleansing constantly which shuts down a shadow priest pretty hard.
---
This problem is overstated. If you notice lots of dispels in organized play, swap to rank one Shadow Word Pain. Cleanse and dispel are very expensive to chain cast, so you’ll both occupy and oom their healers while still building your shadow weaving stacks and getting your blackout procs. As damage mounts from your allies, enemy healers are forced to heal, not debuff. Swap to max rank then. Mindblast and mind flay do plenty of damage in the meantime. Classic pvp had bursty damage and healers needed to swap to heals once those health bars started to empty because they’d lose people if they didn’t.
---
They do have mobility and mana issues. But if they’re well played, they’re absolute beasts. In Vanilla my premade always ran with a shadow priest and as I recall he was outstanding damage/kb’s and particularly useful at returning flags in WSG. In particular, silence can be absolutely devastating in group play because it’s duration is so long. And mana burn, esp if talented, can be a game changer on offense.
---
Ash has incredibly low drop rate, I never saw it drip once.
---
  I did get slavemaker on my first kt kill which made up for it.
---
There is always at least 1 spot for lock with corruption(sm/ruin) since he has to run a imp for the tanks. Mostly the most skilled lock gets that spot since the pet has to stand close to the tank and not next to you. Manapot and demonic rune combined with lifetap is a game changer even if the others outgear you.
---
7/21/23 aka corruption with demo sac. Is probably the highest consistent dps spec since sm/ruin is based on rng on nightfall procs (instant shadowbolts) also most bosses don't have adds with high hp which make corruption not worth it. It has to fully tick through to make it worth. Shadowburn is only worth as finisher or when it crits. 
---
Lock is one of those classes in vanilla that seem boring but making the cut is the challenge. Also and raid take a lock of a mage or other dpses. And you can rock it even with small amount of consumes WHICH I DONT RECOMMEND FOR ANY CLASS. Fullbannnanas or go home. 
---
Races? Orc or gnome with gnome being by far the best ally(lock) race... The int bonus defentliy makes a cut might not be in mc but in naxx gear it's almost 2%crit with more time to cast SB before life taping. 
---
When to lifetap? Ofc it depends on the fight... On a phase transfer (ice block phase on saph) I would always tap full since we have to move quite abit. On fights like bwl dragons depending on your spec I only lifetapd when I couldn't cast shadowbolts aka below 400mana.
---
&gt; Games should be designed for the long term players.
---
Nope. The 75% or more that will quit in the first months are worth about the same or more to Blizzard than the 25% or less that will stick with the game for a year plus. They know a large chunk of that 25% will stick around regardless, so they should always cater to the 75%.
---
You might think you're better than the casuals, but you're no more a priority than them to Blizzard.
---
Same goes for Retail vs Classic. A Retail player is worth 3-4 Classic players.
---
Except everyone tells me the fights only last 1 minute now!  Lightning bolt is like the best scaling spell in the game, because it goes from a 3 second cast to 2.
---
Yes let’s keep complaining about something temporary for launch...
---
“The﻿ technology is there only for launch and will fade away in about a mo﻿nth, albeit it's still hard to determine if this is true, but it should definitely be gone before Phase 2 and world bosses become available in Classic.﻿”
---
retailers and blizzard shills are sadly already the majority in this sub. they will downvote and choke every criticism towards blizzard and their retail concepts.
---
I am with you, I don't want layers. But as long as they stick to the promise of removing it soon after launch, I can't get too upset about it.
---
Ha!
---
I’m still so noob though, is World of Warcraft a game? Is priest a fruit or a vegetable?
---
You have 50+ days to clear all the content in Shadowbringers before Classic launches. That's more than enough to finish MSQ and grind some gear.
---
Listening to Peaches En Regalia by Frank Zappa while questing through The Barrens.
---
Addons cannot perfectly replicate the original
---
Combat dagger was beastly för raiding, less sexy solo or in pvp scenarios. This from alliance a rogue. 30/3/18 Will let you do anything.
---
Tap it for 3 colorless
---
Look up the last boss and subtract 2 levels
---
Carapace Spine Crossbow was a drop they added later on in vanilla as a catchup mechanic so it wont drop in Phase 1 so Blackcrow is pre-bis for hunters
---
&gt;Daaaaaaaaaaaamn sounds like a MASSIVE drop in dps.........
---
it's not but still dal'rends are better.
---
I get that. But Layering does very little harm, if any, and is a very temporary thing. The fact that everything will be in its 1.12 state is much worse for a true Vanilla experience and no one really argues against that.
---
they fucked it up in wod, fixed it in legion for like a minute, broke it again, and then fucking ruined it in bfa.
---
seemsGurgthockman
---
Your bias against hunters seems to be blinding your ability to see just how OP the spell dmg hunter would be.
---
Lmao sad but true.
---
[citation needed]
---
I raided every week for 9 months straight on a private server and the only thing i really used soul shards for was Shadowburn on boss fights and keeping SS up on a healer.
---
If anyone thinks there is a need for additional "Life at 60" threads which cover aspects not listed here, please send me a pm with that thread and I'll add it to the original post!

LoL breaker of China, nice reference!

Then the Chinese farmer spawned on top of it, and took it.

Unfortunately the story is pretty generic and even boring until 2.3 - 2.4 patch. It gets much better after 2.3.

Troll priests make total sense lorewise dude what are you talking about....
---
&gt; Something something how much one decision is worth to blizzard something something 
---
Dude... Unless you *work* for Blizzard you know jack shit about that.
---
Stop using it as an argument, because it's not an argument. It's just made up stuff.
---
Soulfire Crit. Hnnngggg
---
My brother is going for world first. He smokes a ton of dope so i dont think he will get any where close
---
Yeah but you dont need alchemy to use the useful items from that profession. You HAVE to be an engineer to use the engineer equipment
---
unpopular opinion, I dress up as a female panda
---
Yes, in theory, but nobody has ever been able to replicate it perfectly. Also, it was in the game back then so there's no reason why we should have to use addons.
---
I in some perverse way actually hope he won't drop loot until phase 2. The threads here screaming about it could be glorious. 
---
In a slightly less perverse way hope he will drop loot at phase 1 because it just would be silly if he didn't. I guess I win either way?
---
What the fuck retard post is this, there could literally not be a post more circlejerky as this one. 
---
Only fucking message is “classic good, Rest bad” Jesus we know that for years already stop fucking circlejerking so hard
---
If they don't fix this, I'm not playing. We wanted true vanilla. Not a half assed version.
---
No. This ain't it. A similarly skilled mage will beat a warlock most of the time. A more skilled warlock will dominate a mage in BGs, 1v1, and meters dependent on the encounter. I've played both and against both.
---
Yes, some servers made
---
You've never seen a good lock in AQ gear I take it?
---
But...I just got off.
---
My two cents is the idea of silithus is okay if blizzard focused more on developing world pvp and re-worked battlegrounds so that they where not spammable.
---
I'd prefer world pvp over battlegrounds from a design point. But how you would go about to really making the world pvp feel worth it is honestly a mystery to me. Maybe somehow combine PvE and PvP together
---
That's exactly how it was
---
&gt; Unless you work for Blizzard you know jack shit about that.
---
No, they're a publicly shared company. Their quarterly earnings reports show they make over half their revenue from microtransactions. And BFA expansion sales surpassed $300m, which is almost 2 million subscriber years.
---
Hey, how is the fight for RP-PVP going? I would very much like to play on one at launch!
---
The gifs also show lvl70 vs retail instead of lvl60 in classic vs classic beta.
---
Kind of hard to make a point when your examples are completely off base, also the character in the original crit much more often like you said. They also had significantly higher attack speed.
---
LUL

Lmao

1. 2xBone Slicing Hatchet (B.S.Hatchet) +15 agi enchant both:
---
56 agi
---
112 ranged AP (from agi)
---
1.09% crit (from agi)
---
2% dodge (from agi)
---
112 AC (from agi)
---
10 sta = 100 HP
---
no rogue can claim rights on this
---
2. Dal'Rend's Arms set (Dal'Rend) +15 agi enchant both:
---
30 agi
---
110 ranged AP (50 bonus + 60 from agi)
---
1.58% crit (1% stat + 0.58% from agi)
---
1.07% dodge (from agi)
---
160 AC (100 stat + 60 from agi)
---
4 str (useless)
---
+10 defence skill
---
every sword specced rogue will claim rights on this = hard to get
---
3. Barbarous Blade (B.Blade) +15 agi enchant:
---
15 agi
---
90 ranged AP (60 stat + 30 from agi)
---
1.29% crit chance (1% stat + 0.29% from agi)
---
0.53% chance to dodge
---
30 AC (from agi)
---
many warriors/pallies want it over Arcanite Reaper (A.Reaper) for PvP because of crazy price tag on A.Reaper
---
4. 2xDawn's Edge (D.Edge) +15 agi enchant on both:
---
60 ranged AP (from agi)
---
2.58% crit (2% stat + 0.58% from agi)
---
60 AC (from agi)
---
every1 can have cos it's a recipe
---
Let hunter's base ranged DPS is 130 (so 1% of crit will add 1.95 DPS), base health is 4000, and base AC is 3000. Now lets compare B.S.Hatchet ranged DPS and other stats to every1 else listed above:
---
1. B.S.Hatchet vs Dal'Rend:
---
+2 AP - 0.49% crit = +0.14 DPS - 0.9555 DPS = -0.8155 DPS = -0.627% DPS
---
+0.93% dodge
---
+100 HP = +2.5% HP
---
-48 AC = -1.6% AC
---
-10 def skill = -3.33% def skill
---
Verdict: B.S.Hatchet &lt;= Dr.Arms
---
2. B.S.Hatchet vs B.Blade:
---
+22 AP - 0.2% crit = +1.57 DPS - 0.39 DPS = +1.18 DPS = +0.9% DPS
---
+1.47% dodge
---
+82 AC = +2.73% AC
---
Verdict: B.S.Hatchet &gt; B.Blade
---
3. B.S.Hatchet vs D.Edge:
---
+52 AP - 1.49% crit = +3.71 DPS - 2.9 DPS = +0.81 DPS = +0.62% DPS
---
+52 AC = +1.73% AC
---
Verdict: B.S.Hatchet &gt; D.Edge
---
Finally:
---
B.S.Hatchet is prolly better than B.Blade or D.Edge. So best blue melee weapons for hunter are B.S.Hatchet and Dal'Rend set. But B.S.Hatchet is easier to get.
---
Period.
---
Warlocks do not scale better with gear than mages. If you're talking about PVP, that's irrelevant to my comments.
---
You're right, I played melee so that the bottom part of my tabard wouldn't be cut off by the kilt.
---
I seriously doubt that you are in any way qualitfied to reason based on that.
---
Monkeys.
---
&gt; and meters dependent on the encounter.
---
Nope.
---
Daft.
---
What does she want to play? Any combo can work for having fun together - if you care about both raiding then all I'd say is to be different classes.
---
Holy Nova makes it much much easier if I remember correctly.
---
Won’t happen, all online games have devolved into twitch chat spewing garbage.
---
As a horde player, I disagree with this.
---
Paladins: please keep rolling ret and protection. Holy is totally overrated. You're not some celebate priest who spams heals all day. You're a holy warrior! Be that holy warrior. After all, its you who needs those blessing and heals. Your allies simply slow down your crusade against the unjust. 
---
So please, keep rolling ret and protection. The horde thanks you for your selfless service. Don't let your memes be dreams.
---

---
Death bringer is a tank weapon ;)

Arcanite reaper, nightfall, dark edge of insanity...

Cant really comment on locks. But shamans have 9 ranks of heals that they should have on their bar (2 lesser healing waves, 4 healing waves, 3 chain heals). 2 ranks of each of their shocks, they have 23 totems (2 of which dont really require a bind Flametounge tot+Sentry totem). Then as resto you have NS, your racial active ability. Target macros, party member hotkeys(unnecessary with certain addons).  Cure poison, cure disease, potentially 2 trinkets, bandages, consumables (HP pot, Mana Pot, Water, demonic rune, any engineering consumes). Ghost wolf, purge, lightning shield (can also bind lightning shield 1 to bait purges). And then you have 5 more abilities that don't need to be bound (astral recall, far sight, ancestral spirit,Water breathing and water walking). Oh yeah and lightning bolt/chain lightning.  
---
so, 9 + 6 + 21 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 60 binds 
---
These all aren't necessary, especially for a casual player, but in order to be fully in control of your character you will be looking at least 50.

I think non-WoW players like the Leeroy video a lot more than WoW players do.  
---
How many times I've heard someone who doesn't play WoW yell Leeroy when they figure out I play.
---
Absolutely agree, thanks for bringing this to everyone's attention. I especially like how the old animation clearly separates each damage amount whereas it gets all mushed together in the modern version.
---
unilaterally consensual! :P
---
I agree, the old animation feels much more statisfying. But it's also technially much worse than the new one. Numbers suddenly appearing on a different position because the old number is gone. And jesus christ, it's so pixelated. 
---
Personally I'd rather have the new one and accept the drawback of it being a bit more "boring" than the old one.
---
Perhaps I'm in the minority here but I'm fine sacrificing having familiar names on the opposing faction absent 33% of the time in the first few months in order to have 66% less players in the starting zones. 
---
It is unfortunate that for those of us who will progress ahead of the pack that layering will effect higher level zones as well but I understand it's purpose and won't let it deter me from playing. 
---
The melee leeway is a very weird one. Last I read, convoluted reports on whether it was initially in Vanilla. And spell batching I'm honestly a little lost on. I remember it being covered in a Countdown to Classic podcast I watched but I don't remember what it is lol
---
All three of these guys grabbed clothes from the same dresser.
---
Any warlock who can give a summon and occasionally a healthstone is top tier in my books. A few guilds I've been in insist on everyone being at a place without relying on summons anyway.
---
Basically what I'm implying is that it won't be anywhere near as bad as you seem to think!
---
Oh God it's you...
---
We can only hope
---
If you're going to debase yourself by rolling alliance, gnome is the best option. They're superior to undead (and troll, and human) in every functional way for both pvp and pve.
---
There will be 16 debuff slots
---
When are you and Zephan going to finish testing  fire locks?!
---
Outside of vanilla and TBC I can't think of a time? Maybe Cata if you were struggling with the heroics?
---
I'll be smoking pot the entire time I play lmao. Looking forward to passing out in my computer chair by the time I hit ashenvale on a horde char day 1.
---
You'll get into raids just for being a healer
---
Roll which one you like better. If you like druids, you'll be just fine finding a raid group. If you don't mind dropping totems and spamming chain heal, go shaman. If you want the specialized raid healer with a larger healing kit, go priest
---
3 stars fitting for that sort of hunter.
---
Ok, thanks. That's what we were using in ZG at the time, but we were very laid-back, there never were any problem.
---
We are all pretty much indifferent and/or having a hard time deciding lol.
---
I'm reading this entire conversation, but I don't understand what Shadow weaving is. Is that your Shadow Spec but you are still healing and DPS in raids?
---
Priest has some good utility with Mana burn and pyschic scream. There are probably some good holy/disc builds for that. Full shadow can run into some problems because you have to drop shadow form to heal.
---
Ret paladins go really good with both classes. They can cleanse, give you BOP, and can heal a little. Mostly, you play very offensive and kill people in a HOJ.
---
All 3 classes are good levelers and you can make all 3 work well in pvp. I'd pick whatever you enjoy playing most.
---
You see every class in TBC raids for completely different reasons that involved complete redesigns and a shift away from traditional rpg elements. 
---
In TBC you bring exact raid comps to buff individual classes who manage the most optimal dps. That involves raid leaders moving players around mid combat and 4/5 players in each dps party being leatherworking for drums. It’s pretty much the norm in TBC for warlocks to be doing 50% more dps than their counterparts so it’s odd you even made this argument.
---
Sorry, the gaming community has changed in the last 15 years, you're going to get that new community in that old game. Fun mix, just watch
---
That's a feelsbadman.
---
A spec being played and a spec that is best for raiding is two completely different things.in vanilla not every single spec is supposed to be great at raiding. 
---
People are over estimating how much min/max is going to effect endgame. Min/maxing is not running a raid with your correct raiding spec. Min/maxing is requiring your raid to be correct racials, professions, all bis boe gear. 
---
There will be a very very small percentage of guilds that will require this. Like very small. 
---
Saying a guild is requiring you to be the correct raiding spec is not because of min/maxing it’s because 39 other people don’t want to carry dead weight.
---
Honestly, the pre patch cutscenes are the only thing they are doing correctly. As someone said in another comment- just make conversations in-engine or do those quests where they give backstory as they are flying into a zone. 
---
Wildstar and the Star Wars MMO had a communication system that would give dialog as you were questing. That was great.
---
DUDE. I knew something was fcking wrong.
---
YES. This is the old damage text we used to have! Hits would stick and pop! The new text is not interesting and just scrolls
---
Who told you they were using MDMA in overwatch?  
---
Seems pretty silly, unless it helps you relax and lets you focus better that way
---
It's such an incredible mix of nutrition advice and demands to sacrifice health and wellness.
---
There mere fact that you think this is easily done with simple high school math just goes to show that you have zero idea what youre talking about.
---
&gt;So we shall see how it all goes! Here's hoping they eventually do like Everquest does, "progression servers". Basically a reset of the timeline, and walks through the expansions and sometime down the line, they reset again. (This may take 5-7 YEARS per reset, WoW's raids are a lot slower than Everquest)
---
I would actually enjoy this a lot.
---
I had a feeling if i posted that screenshot maybe atleast one person from the guild would respond. Its a small world. I had a lot of fun on that server too, it was such a long time ago and i was so young
---
KEK
---
... Retail?
---
Oh wow...another pvp video :P
---
It's funny how many petty changes people are focusing on now that the Beta is pretty fleshed out.
---
It was hit and miss. Ulduar was incredible. Naxx was too little for too long, and frankly too easy. DKs were insanely OP. ToC was too little for too long. It cut short Ulduar, and whilst the fights were fun it was short and it's all we had for a looong time. ICC was great, the dungeons were as well. I loved achievements and Wintergrasp as well. The story and questing were great, however introducing dungeon finder was a mistake and I don't like there being 4 stages of ICC
---
POGS IN THE CHATTUH
---
Watch the start of the video maybe? Parsed data from raids.
---
If you were smart enough to understand what's being spoken about you would know two things. The item is bis for rogues/warriors and this would only be a filler until said hunter got their prebis. So giving the hunter strikers mark would be completely dumb. That's not min/maxing, thats not fucking over two classes worth of players to benefit one person for a short period who doesn't have their prebis. As I said below, it's hard to gear 40 people so wasting good pieces that last multiple tiers as prebis filler is beyond stupid. I'd rather play with autists than people like your self, at least they have some logic.
---
Me too thanks
---
That is poetry.
---
I feel this so hard. Male trolls lookin tasty with a tabard and a long cloak.
---
Your forgetting resists which will hit you harder than just the 10%.
---
It depends on the content. PvP or dungeons or raids. 0/30/21 is the most balanced hybrid spec because you can tank, cat dps, and heal just by changing out your gear set
---
Later if you manage to get some spell dmg gear you can try specs with more balance tree focus
---
For me personally, if the guild advert doesn’t say “casual” anywhere in it, I move on
---
I was deploy in Iraq.
---
Even without taking drugs, people like myself have a high metabolism and require way more food and water than the average person. Even overheating more frequently. 
---
This is a serious concern we all need to worry about. If people plan to make hardcore decisions, we need to help spread the message of staying healthy.
---
How are undead frost mages going to make youtube videos full of frenetic zooming and editing with this tame damage, right?
---
It's not the same, not even close.
---
Playing dota. I quit when the TBC talents came since they completely broke the game. Mages water elementals could solo people.
---
Mages are the aoe class. They can arcane explosion, frost nova, and cone of cold. Priests can also holy nova. Warlocks can hellfire but it's not an instant cast and requires you to stand still and channel. Shamans have an aoe pulsing totem but it doesn't do much damage. Pretty sure that's all of them.
---
Being braindead must be enjoyable
---
Where did i say any of that ? Did I say a guild requires anything ? lol you are going way off base. I  just said mix maxers are scaring people off. Mainly in this subreddit. If they were there would not by a new thread every day regarding it. Like this one. I have no idea what you are getting at.
---
I like mage because you can get away with raiding and pvping on the same spec. Also, portals are an amazing time saver.
---
Warlock also has Rain of Fire...
---
I read that whole thing and this is the only mention of Adderall...
---
Run in, hellfire, and you can afk for 10 seconds while doing epic DPS. Blame noob healer(s) in case you die.
---
hard truth for the little kids:
---
wrath sucked and bc was just average. 
---
this opinion from someone who started in vanilla, raided a bit, also raided in BC but didn’t start really raiding hardcore til wrath.
---
Loot council is way better when you are sending nudes to the council.
---
All of those *are* fun, though. They are if you’re gaming for the immersion and experience anyway.
---
Yes but it's not point blank
---
Blast Wave...
---
not exactly point blank, which is why he didn't include Blizzard.
---
I think that they are letting you mail up to 12 items at once on beta. I could be wrong though
---
It made its way back in Legion as part of the "Call of the Scarab" micro-holiday. Both factions compete to get the most war effort resources in 3 days, one of the world quests is the good ol Silithyst. Honestly, only the first year of that event have I ever seen serious Silithyst PvP
---
&gt; I think non-WoW players like the Leeroy video a lot more than WoW players do.
---
It was especially bad for those of us that played on Laughing Skull. There was a huge influx of players that joined our server to either play with Leeroy or kill him and any P4L. It really ruined the community we had going, imo.
---
Push
---
I, personally, am very happy they're doing sharding for the first while. It means I might actually be able to log in and play when it launches.
---
This is one of the more absurd complaints/issues I have seen on this sub-reddit. Are you guys just inventing things to bitch about until release? Seriously, go to a private server, look your family in they eyes one last time, maybe build something, idk. Just come up with something to fill the void in your soul other than endless nagging about petty bits of the game.
---
I enjoy vanilla the most out of all three, but I don't think wrath and tbc sucked in most peoples eyes as the sub #'s just climbed higher and higher hitting in all time peak in wrath. Cataclysm on the other hand people just started leaving in droves.
---
That won't do anything.  What we need to do is agree to right click report them for spam.  That will fix the problem.
---
Funny, I live in a desert and I feel the same way as you. Only with Winterspring, I love the snow and the silence around you when walking around. Altercation Valley also gives me these fuzzy feelings
---
I couldn't care less; if Blizzard doesn't add it I will download/create an Addon that does it. I would rather have Blizzard devote their resources to gameplay bugs.
---
Possibly completely wrong, but here is how I've been answering these types of questions for my own personal planning:
---
* Patch 1.2: Phase 1 
---
* Patch 1.3: Phase 2
---
* Patch 1.6: Phase 3
---
* Patch 1.7: Phase 4
---
* Patch 1.9: Phase 5
---
* Patch 1.11: Phase 6
---
This was from seeing what phases coincide with what patches at [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch/1.x](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch/1.x) 
---
Blizzard has said that they plan on not updating items with new stats, but they do seem keen on rolling out the more powerful gear to coincide with their relevant raid tiers. If I was to guess, Argent Dawn would not be present until Phase 2(Gamepedia has 1.3 as the patch Argent Dawn was established and Mantles of Dawn being available).
---
Similarly I would guess that the Argent Dawn's rewards would not be all available at once. Formula: Enchant Bracer - Healing Power is available at revered but wasn't introduced until 1.6. I am expecting to see this enchant become available in Phase 3 with BWL/Darkmoon Faire Decks.

If anyone has any further information, please correct me.

I’m an old, I don’t even know what poggers or monkeys are. (Well, other than a monkey being a primate)

That’s the best thing about the eventual coexistence between classic and retail. We’ll finally be able to (mostly) accept whatever direction Blizzard wants to take the game, because anyone who returns to wow because it was “so good in its time” will have the past to live in, aka classic.
---
I seriously hope they keep dramatically changing retail story-wise. These two versions of the game will be healthy for its existence.
---
with a face like that, never.
---
I still remember we started on consumes for progression attempts for a lot of fights, it wasn't naxx and aq that started the trend. All the way back to MC and getting Onyxia buffed for Rag attempts. But we were not using consumables on a few wings just before TBC because our gear was insane.  
---
It is a long haul, but all the wings had upgrades that were huge progress pieces towards completing the next content.
---
100% this. They added the internal cooldown on changing layers so it can’t be abused. Any current outrage is ignorance and/or selfishness
---
The DR I think is overblown. There is a clip of the hunter Zeroed In beta using scatter and using rank 2 Freezing trap and the trap lasted 7 seconds. Rank 3 trap last 20 seconds, so logically it should DR to 10 seconds. If the DR is really that big of a deal you can always pick up clever traps which will make it last another few seconds. 
---
In my experience I rarely used trap without a scatter first, so sprint/charge through a trap will be rare. Obviously I hope they fix it, but scatter then trap was always the main way to do it. 
---
Hunter is one of the strongest PvP classes, and as you mentioned melee was never difficult for a hunter. Honestly I never felt threatened by a rogue or warrior, so I don’t think 2 extra yards will change that. Hunters just have so many tools to keep melee away from them.
---
No, it was removed several patches before 1.12 so it’s not in the game. I kind of wish it was though it was pretty mystical
---
Uhm ok
---
Thx
---
You just have to take two priests to 60! Problem solved! ;)
---
But chuck norris is for that vanilla chat experience
---
True, Blizzard admitted they waited to do a full class balance because they were launching BC and it would be massive changes. They knew it wasnt balanced.
---
And yes I know the role hunters have and that it’s important. I mained a hunter in vanilla and plan to again, obviously not to top the meters.
---
Oh yea true I always associate blast wave more with tbc so it slipped my mind
---
Vanilla days, well early vanilla had no DR on anything
---
Engineering is great if you are rich.
---
However, its a big money sink and gold is hard to get.
---
aight
---
This makes me unreasonably upset
---
It's amazing how much people are blowing this out of proportion. The actual amount of time layering will affect you is so incredibly small.
---
Rather than being unplayable for a week, you'll be minorly inconvenienced 0.01% of the time
---
I didnt even know Legion Kara was a thing. I was talking about BC Kara + Crypts that were originally planned.
---
its viable enough for the first two raid tiers. once mages roll fire in aq40, bringing an additional PI priest with 20 points in the shadow tree for weaving can be a bigger net positive for the raid group. it is the jack of all trades priest in vanilla. With t2/equivalent gear you can heal just fine by downranking, and your prayer of healing is still extremely strong for certain bosses/trash pulls.
---
The Illidan fight was famous for panic healing during his enrages. Spamming/cancelling max rank greater heal(10-12k crits) til near OOM to get an innervate and do it all over again...
---
Adjusting for inflation thats like 20k repairs
---
My guild and I were camping the flight path at the alliance city in blasted lands.
---
Lol those holy fire crits were insane. I wonder what his gear setup was like
---
Tipsout will be doing another cross faction tournament next week sunday I think
---
I disagree about the gathering profs specifically. Getting xp while gathering stuff feels awesome. Being able to pick high-level herbs, even for a tiny % of the profit, feels awesome.
---

What would you do if you were a troll shadow priest?

The fact that its 2019 and we still have repair bills....

i cant upvote this enough, good comparison and i hope it gets changed too

I don’t believe it’s narcissism, but an attention span problem.

Each generation that has come after the previous has had a shorter attention span. And it’s only getting worse.

"Cover this man in gold"
---
Goddamn, that is what I loved in FFXI. Crafting was hard as fuck, expensive, and time consuming. But if you took your time, did some spread sheets, and surfed allakazham, yiu really rewarded, really really rewarded. 
---
You needed money just to level past the halfway mark of the level cap, and if you wanted to do anything even remotely approaching end game, you better be farming some drops. 
---
So when you made money crafting eventually, you set yourself up to be a dominate player. Not like WOW where you can buy a few epic BOEs that drop before you start raiding hard in a new expansion, and give yourself a slight edge. You stood lightyears ahead of other FFXI players still wearing what could they scrape together of their AF and cheap AH gear. Gear really meant something, you know when and where you got a piece, and it meant something.
---
Spell penetration doesn't exist on gear in Classic and is primarily a PVP stat, just like the spell penetration on curses. It's worthless in PVE.
---
There was a 2h in WotLK, and the Thunderforged stuff in MoP. There are others.
---
Probably not, but it should still be fine. I just would really not recommend it, you can get a nvidia 1050 for like 40 bucks lol I’d just pick one up, you don’t even need to upgrade your power supply for it.
---
Graphics and effects are a big pact of the nostalgic feeling. There's nothing "bitchy" about this complaint. The old numbers are not only better looking imo, but they're part of the feeling. I mean, absolutely every shitty black and white linkin park PvP video started with these crits. They just feel a lot different and more impactful.
---
It is. Just play with addon around, you can use Mik's Scrolling Battle Text addon aswell, you can basically make Vanilla font+stack on top of each other+pop up crits instead of modern fading crit numbers. There is a lot of customisation with these 3 addons.
---
Do you know which? I’d love to check out a player created zone
---
Not any specific song, but rather any song that played heavily on MTV. I used to keep the tv on in the background, back when MTV played music until like 8pm.
---
I played an Undead priest, mostly spent time in holy/disc spec. 
---
Raiding: auto-invites mostly, most fights were about timing and mana management. Very few fights required mechanics outside of healing
---
PVP: If you aren't completely outgearing me 1v1 I could handle myself most times. As holy spec it was a fight of attrition, knowing the MP5 mechanic well would often tip the fight in my favor. Often times I could keep the fight going long enough for a nearby friend to come help. 
---
Gold: I sucked at this TBH, the only way I made it work was to farm with a warlock friend. She was herbalist/enchanting and I was mining/jewelcrafting(in TBC), pretty much would have zones to ourselves because nobody would fuck with us. My favorite pastime was watching her one-shot shadowbolt the chinese gold farmers. 
---
My time was spent either raiding or preparing to raid, basically farming with a healthy dose of world pvp, red == dead. Since I was a pure healspec my DPS was pretty awful, so having a farming partner is a must IMO.
---
kk
---
I am not here to babysit a manchild. I provided you source and you can watch it or not.
---
They also fade fast and ate harder to see imo
---
you wont need much to play classic as its spec requirement is quite low. Id say the biggest improvement for you would be your ram (im assuming you meant 1024 not 10k), and depending on your budget maybe a newer gpu, the 7670 is quite old and outdated now. But still, as i said the requirements are quite low, i used to play vanilla on an extremely old pc 15 years ago and didnt have many problems besides the capital cities.
---
But why though? WoW would dominate on consoles. Diablo 3 did very well on PS4 and Switch.
---
FF14 has a large amount of their playerbase that plays on consoles.
---
If they wanted to they could tap that market.
---
That's only assuming there is zero tradeoff for it. Blackout is definitely better than Shadow Reach for leveling and PvP and that's usually the tradeoff most people will be making. Improved MB, Fade, and VE are garbo
---
That's the joke.
---
WoW runs too poorly to make a decent console port.
---
aah
---
But now the gathering doesn't make much and engineering is a joke
---
It's a 15 year old game, so it will probably work fine. 
---
Your CPU is good.   
---
Your GPU is ancient.   Over 7 years old.   If you want to play with higher graphics settings, then you will need to buy another GPU.
---
hey thanx for join peeps, best of luck!
---
D3 uses 5 abilities, ffxiv is an xmog game
---
Keyboards are inferior to controllers, but mice aren't. There are addons that completely eliminate the need for a cursor in WoW.
---
It looks like the font is higher resolution in classic, which oddly enough actually looks worse to me.
---
An update goes out making time an int64_t instead of an int32_t
---
lol its pretty obvious that you would give the mark to a war/rogue. Or that you would prefer to give any absolute bis piece to its wearer. I'm talking about guilds that don't give loot to people that havn't completed prebis. It's an unnecessary time sink. You're a gaping asshole.
---
the gathering still makes a good amount as they just released new herbs, ores, so not only are you wrong, but gathering professions are better than usual at the moment
---
I wrote this for another guy's question above, but you'll find it useful.
---
    /use [@pet,dead]Revive Pet;[nocombat,harm,nodead]Dash (pet)  
---
    /targetenemy [noexist][dead]  
---
    /castsequence [nocombat] reset=combat Hunter's Mark, Serpent Sting; reset=6 Arcane Shot, Mend Pet  
---
    /petattack [combat]
---
First press: finds a new target and Hunter's Marks it. 
---
Second press: uses pet's Dash, fires Serpent Sting, and sends pet.
---
Third press: Arcane Shot. If your pet is injured, you press it again after Arcane Shot to heal. If your pet dies, it will prioritize reviving the pet.
---
You can't check statuses so you can't have a macro smartly recast Serpent Sting. The best you could do is have a cast-sequence with a reset duration equal to Serpent Sting's debuff. Instead, I rely on the assumption that if you're targeting a live enemy and you are not in combat, then you must not have Marked/Serpent Stun it.
---
this isn't even the coolest part. The coolest part is that the proc lets the user speak (not understand) Dwarven for a few seconds...so Horde rogues can whisper sweet nothings to the poor dwarf they're currently stunlocking
---
This is very intriguing. I’m planning to try out blessed recovery by dipping into holy on my troll spriest. The idea is to reduce the number of times I have to hop out of shadow form to heal between that, troll regen and vampirism. Plus the reduced spell damage on the tier before it is pretty strong, and compliments the reduced physical damage of shadow form nicely. The only downsides are that I’m missing out on mana efficiency from discipline and the first 5 points in holy end up being useless outside of the times I am popping out of shadow to heal, which is what I’m trying to reduce in the first place.

I think it’s wrong to say it wasn’t growing. In Cata, the subs got even higher for about 2-3 weeks. If Cata didn’t suck for so many people, Cata could have continued the trend and kept growing. We only look at Wrath as “stagnant” when you look at it with context: Cata dropped off and didn’t continue the trend.

This is fine.

Adderal is common as fuck these days. We have whole communities of young people who don’t even realize they’re meth addicts. Back in college I did real drugs, so I was never into the lame shit our gov pushes on us - but I have friends now who have addy prescriptions and crack those fuckers open like candy. 
---
That being said I’m sure some of them are taking addy, and some others are doing blow / whatever other upper they can get their hands on. Some others are probably main lining Mountain Dew red - and props to them for being a G.
---
But yea, lots of drugs to be server first - you can be sure of that much!

drugs r bad! my mommy said so

Diablo 3 required no in-game text chat to succeed on consoles. A lack of in-game text chat would be destroy WoW.

Yeah, I would bet solid money that we see a BC and Wrath launch.

Wtf is going on here

Some people would rather ask players in the community directly as opposed to Google. No one knows if the suggestion Google gives you is going to be good or not, it's just relevant.
---
No, I am probably gonna buy a new rig around Christmas time  anyways but I was just worried that my first few months of beta would be laggy for me on my MacBook.
---
Except layering is remarkably close to sharding.
---
It’s always been extremely simple and basic and has always lacked any serious depth or complexity. From the gathering of materials to actually crafting and the stuff you can make. There’s opportunity to make crafting and profession systems as integral and complex as raiding and progressing your character that way. 
---
Instead it’s always been a little wimpy addition to your character w zero depth. 
---
Check out a game like Star Wars Galaxies (yes diff games) and see what they did with crafting and it will blow your mind.
---
Failing miserably. ESO is miles better than retail wow.
---
Dude is this fiveshot, I’m on my phone so I can’t actually see the name

Look at how black desert potted to xbox. I know its still less skills than wow but they did a good job and I think blizzard could use this style.
---
Give me the wrath launch event complete with griefing zombies and I'll be happier than a pig in shit.
---
Kara is one of the big reasons I can’t wait for BC. And so i can do it as a prot paladin and have tons of heroics to do.
---
popularity of games spread differently in those days though, things were slower to catch on and rise in popularity. a lot of it was through word of mouth and offline communication. so the sub numbers in bc and wrath came following the success of earlier versions of the game.
---
With respect Master Godwings101, perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.
---
A long time ago I was in Stranglethorn Vale. My friends and I were working for the Steamwheedle Cartel - they were trying to buy the loyalty of Troll tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones. But their caravans were being raided in a jungle north of Grom'gol by a bandit.
---
So we went looking for the stones, but in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him. One day, I saw a Gnome playing with a Star Ruby the size of a Goldenbark Apple. The bandit had been throwing them away. He thought it was good sport.
---
Some men aren't looking for anything logical like money - they can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
Best use of this meme I’ve ever seen lol
---
It's the key ingredient in flasks and several other high-end alchemy recipes, and its also very rare, with only a few spawn points in the highest level zones. Classic won't have any dynamic/accelerated resource node respawns so it will almost certainly be even more rare than private servers.
---
I played a rogue primarily during vanilla, had an excessive amount of /played (1yr once TBC released) and I would say during my time, i spent about 90% of my time as daggers. I cleared every raid with daggers and was normally top 1-3 for dps depending on fights of course. I would recommend maybe swords or at least a combat build for leveling, but daggers for end game/pvp/ganking etc. The playstyle that daggers introduces is what a rogue is all about.
---
How in your tight fuckhole is that an unpopular opinion?
---
dude... people are using twitch lingo and memes during real life speech, no chance it’s going away for classic.
---
I grew up in the hood, so I had just discovered rock music at that time, and was finally diversifying my music tastes. I listened to a ton of Metallica, Linkin Park, a metric fuckton of Tool, Evans Blue, 10 years, The Black Mages, Gackt, Dir en Grey (sp), Alter Bridge (maybe that was a few years later,) Girugamesh, Ginuwine, Rammstien, Ludacris, G-Unit blew my deck that I was rocking two 12” house subs with a 1200watt alpine. I was also listening to a lot of Yellowcard because of the cutey Russian I was dating at the time, which got me into other punk/angsty/loud Warp Tour bands like Flogging Molly, Bad Religion, Panic at the Disco whose name I always forget and think is Blood in the Dance floor which is a godawful band that has a pedo as a singer, Korn, Coheed and Cambria, etc. so much good stuff back then. I’m sure there is a lot of great stuff now too, but I don’t look around much, and the sheer amount of options and copy cat stuff makes it hard the gems today. 
---
For Classic Wow I’ll probably be listening to a lot of Ghost, Final Fantasy OSTs (up on Spotify now,) and salsa y tropica like Romeo Santos.
---
So I decided I’m just going to roll a priest. I plan on going 5 points in wands and then deep shadow until...when should I switch to a healing focused spec? 60? 58? Sooner?
---
Give this dude some upvotes!
---
Why do you feel the need to call people who disagree with you children? Lmao
---
Thanks everyone. I've not tried bfa on integrated graphics but I think I'll test it tonight. There are a few of us with different issues, my laptop drains power fast with the gtx 1070 running the game and there are times i need more play time between charges. Another friend only uses apple products and doesn't want to waste too much money. Integrated graphics running well enough solves a lot of issues.
---
Ok thank you! I was looking at the Nvidia GT 1030. I’ve read that it isn’t a great card though. Do you think it would be sufficient or classic? It’s the only game I plan on playing.
---
Funny how they translate authentic experience to no changes
---
If Classic has 500k after 2 years (highly likely imo) then it would be foolish to not make BC and Wrath. It’s printing money for such little cost, and the fans absolutely want it.

blacksmithing actually has a crazy amount of OP stuff in vanilla.

Love my gnome ;) i still have him and played until Legion, didnt play BFA. Will make the exact gnome mage again for classic. (P.S im looking for a guild that raids a couple days in the week until 1AM eastern but no later. Going Herb/Alchemy and will help the guild with consumables as i like to grind herbs before going to bed lol)
---
Hey man thanks for the response! What level do you think I should transition in my leveling spec to prot warrior so I can focus on dungeons? as soon as I hit 60 or a bit earlier?
---
I agree. The only problem I have with layering is how it affects higher level gameplay. Like in the 30's with people swapping pvp (or it happens randomly, like you walk up to a guy to kill him and he just zones away), I'm worried about how lonely high lvls will be for a fast/nolife leveler like me, and lastly how it can be abused to farm gold.
---
Honestly IMO dynamic spawns is way way better. Sure it's crazy in the start but it wears out quickly and it's a lot of fun. But obviously people will immediately dislike anything remotely close to pservers :shrug:
---
Is that a sword and a dagger? :)
---
TriHARD
---
Non hardcore guilds absolutely will take a meme spec. It happens even on pservers. The vast majority will be casual raiding guilds. Generally only around 1% of guilds are hardcore on your server. The people here are the minority. What if a menespec player makes their own guild? How about you stop caring how other people play. It’s less competition for you if they meme spec.
---
No, you typically want to try to avoid anything less than  xx50 on Nvidia.   So, like a 1050 or something.  The 1030 is only about 2x as powerful as your current GPU, while the 1050 is about 3.5x as powerful.   Ideally you want like a 60, but that's not always possible for some people.   And the prices of GPUs seem to just keep getting higher and higher.
---
You know there's other ways to have high server caps(to prevent dead servers) that doesn't involve layering right?
---
Yes. Alliance for life.
---
I dont have any real advice but I just flipped a coin for you, heads was warrior tails was rogue and it landed tails...if that helps
---
that was an addon.  there was no damage text in the game.  you want classic? take it all out.
---
Alright. Thanks so much for the input everyone.
---
I mean.. Get an add on?
---
If they have the income but not the common sense on how to buy a machine from Best Buy and install World of Warcraft, we don't want them either.

Yup i played on Kalecgos , Googlez troll warrior. This is pure nostalgia. Wasn’t in the guild but still

You can avoid the wetlands run by swimming.

I am not a top tier player of any game but the few times I've played on psychedelics I noticed drastically better reactions, aim, and perception of enemies. I played Battlefield 1 coming down from an eighth of mushrooms and I performed far, far better than normal. I'd say my typical K/D ratio is around 1.3, but that night I consistently had 5.0+. Could not replicate the next day.
---
Lately it seems like every thread on this sub is full of a bunch of people frustrated they have to wait for release commenting on others replies with condescending and elitest undertones.
---
This thread, and threds like it are a breath of fresh air lol.
---
So maxing out the graphics is actually MORE than original classic? Since it's running the new engine?
---
What kind of upgrades have they made over the original? I know the water. Lighting/shadows, too?
---
There are chat addons so you can blacklist the emotes and never see them. No need to remove the fun from other players if you don't like emotes.
---
Do you guys ever wish every zone wasn't basically encased in mountains?
---
Why is the "now they look so tame" on a level 100 target dummy?  That's not even Classic!
---
I’ll give to the guild if it’s a guild run. If its a pug then it’s mine to do with as I please.
---
Haha appreciate it my man.
---
I will play an alt, casually, on an RPPvP server for the immersion.
---
Throwing my weight behind this, there should definitely be at least one RPPvP server!
---
Chat is a problem for controller play, but actual gameplay is not. I handle raiding, mythic dungeons, and battlegrounds just fine with ConsolePort and the alpha for the Classic Beta works great too.
---
Thanks man, much appreciated :)
---
The 1050 is perfect... I have the 1050Ti gaming and it runs modern WoW on ultra with 60 fps (minus some heavy traffic places) and if you tune it down I get 140+ fps and run it as such on my 144 monitor
---
everything bad from additional servers you also get from layering.  then layering has even more extra bad things ontop of that.
---
I've been trying to figure out what system specs I need for Classic. I've just been looking at the retail system reqs because I haven't seen a definitive answer on performance since the engine is indeed newer. Do you have any idea? I was looking at a laptop with either a 1060 or 1660 Ti. And an 8th or 9th gen Intel CPU
---
I CONCUR
---
This must be somewhere in the code it's not that hard to find it out, fix it already Blizzard
---
I'm looking at the Master of Elements talent. Can it proc multiple times on Blizzard or other AOE spells? I would assume not...?
---
Please fix.
---
Thats actually a great idea, not really up to date with the pservers these days. Do you reckon Pserver data would hold up in Classic?
---
(Atleast enough to get a reasonable idea?)
---
For some reason back in vanilla they must have thought zone pvp objectives were a success. They added this type of thing to half the Outland zones when BC came out. Althought at least in BC you could get the zone buff of +5% damage and it would help you in the raid in that zone. Flying mounts really fucked world pvp though.
---
It's probably the anxiety inhibition that allows you to rely more on muscle memory.  The same reason alcohol is banned in competitive target shooting
---
Does the classic devs read the reddit here much? Is this something that needs to be posted on the official forums as well?
---
I usually never tank deadmines after 17 since you almost always level up inside.  This list is easy mode
---
Reminds me of this :)

---
No? Why not? There used to be a million scrolling text add-ons to get rid of the terrible one your referring to. I'm sure with enough effort, you could easily replicate it.
---
Those are some good suggestions. Hopefully someone will make threads about 'em:)
---
From what I know both male and female have the same hitbox. The only difference is the model is bigger and may not be able to wedge into some exploit places. The animal form has a regular size hitbox. I think Deviate Fish buff gets removed when you shift into a form so a bit of a waste.
---
I just remember the Blizzard forums had player made scheduled PVP events where both factions would plan ahead and agree upon a story/theme and zone it would happen in.
---
I remember doing events in Blackrock Mountain with people fighting on the chains, I remember the Sunken Temple was a "King of the hill" type event and after one side took control the other faction swam under the water together to try and  "surprise" them.
---
It was fun to go to less used zones and areas with huge groups of more than 40 people vs others.
---
Aren't repairs in bfa normalized for armor types now?
---
Haha good one! I still don‘t get the complaining about sharding. Yeah on beta it seemed to be a little bit too much sometimes but in the end it will be necessary for a smooth start. And don‘t tell me you want to be in queue for hours and fight for one mob with 300 people. It was that way in classic but nope. That wasn‘t that much fun tbh
---
I'm simply saying that a mouse and keyboard would not prevent people from playing.
---
There's been a huge push for Mouse and Keyboard support on consoles because of their advantages in FPS games and allowing for a greater range of key mapping.

I’m 31 have a PS4 and don’t own a computer

From all the guides it is advised to put first five points into sprit tap unless you are leveling in a group. I would go full shadow exactly at 40 since shadow form is an amazing DPS and survivability boost.
---
Dude that’s epic.

It's amazing that you got downvoted for saying that this guy should be kicked.   I would be furious if this guy got loot over another caster.   What a joke.

It's like they saw Warhammer Online's world PVP zone/hubs and thought "That's cool!" -- They were right.  They *were* cool.  Sandlol was not cool.

Except that communication will be possible with the whole server regardless of layering. So the community can be built outside of just friends and guilds.

&gt; I'm sure with enough effort, you could easily replicate it.
---
Noone has been able to copy the old style exactly with addons since it was changed.
---
I would say warrior paladin is the best leveling duo for each other. Both have stackable ap buff, both melee and don't rely on mana for damage. Pally can heal and dispel. Warrior can hold agro while paly DPS and offheal.
---
Aight, good luck with that.
---
I’m fine with it though. The more people that get connected with their friends the better. I’d rather see these posts than layering, steamers, and post-Naxx nonsense.
---
The Silithus and EPL world PVP mechanics were added so late into the game it felt like nobody did them. It would be awesome if they got more activity when they launch in Classic.
---
It could possibly be the dopaminergic effects of mdma, but methamphetamine or amphetamine would accomplish this without the significant serotonergic effects.
---
Wow. This is a huge reason why I feel like my damage feels so lackluster these days.  This HAS to happen.
---
I believe the difference your are noticing is primarily due to how the servers used to send data. It came in bunches. Now they can handle sending more frequent updates, which spreads things put into their more proper timing of occurrence. The second thing you are noticing is a much much higher crit chance on the old video, which is just a matter of gear.
---
Well you can ask around in the classic wow warrior discord. I know weapon skill behaves slightly but most things should be applicable to classic.

Lol, try having 60 keybinds on a controller and use them all within 0.1 seconds like you can on a keyboard... Controllers are far far worse to play an MMO

You could go Druid HotW spec, bear for your friends group and heal for raids if you don’t get a tank slot. That’s my plan to have some options when finding a steady 5-man group and guild.

[I made a very comprehensive post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/?) that you should check out. It shows you how to easily (and freely) benchmark your current PC to compare to my test systems. I built systems even older than yours, so you can compare your benchmark results to my test system's benchmark and FPS results from my in-game tests in the Classic Beta.

Only if there is an indicitor that they are console players so you can reject them from groups or give them separate servers.

yeah, communication with *far too many people* to facilitate a healthy realm-community.

You can't keep track of ninjas when every group has multiple ninjas because there's no accountability, you don't need to keep track of enchanters when every /2 need fiery is responded by 200 players, you don't remember who ganked you a week ago when the last time you were ganked by them was a week ago because they spent the past week on different layers and since then you've been ganked by hundreds of other completely different people every time.
---
your server will get a megaqueue and free transfers if you pick one of the few popular realms.  your server will be dead until people transfer to it if you pick one of the majority not popular realms.  most people will be picking the popular realms, which will hold many more people, so more people will wait in longer queues to get on them.

---
you can keep track of them until your realm gets merged, in which case you'd need to also learn the ninjas of the realm you were merged with.  still a manageable amount of people to keep track up.
---
the more often you encounter someone the more likely you are to remember them.  if there's 10x people around, you're 10x less likely to remember an individual.
---
like i said, there will be queues, and because servers can hold more people people are willing to wait in an even longer queue to play on a server that has more people compared to a server that's even more dead because more people are playing on the popular ones.
---
*because layering has all these extra problems on top of the problems of merges*

I, too, enjoy RPPVP, mainly because I feel like RP servers usually have less douchewaffles.
---
Doesn't sound like you've seen much raiding then. Nobody will beat the ignite mage, he has TBC level of dps, but the other mages suffer because of it. Mages only crit for 50% extra damage and their crits do nothing except boost one mage's damage. Warlocks crit for 100% extra damage and subsequent hits deal 20% more damage including on dots. Biggest reason why locks do low damage is a combination of tanks sucking and raids prioritising gearing mages over warlocks. If you remove those two things then warlocks start to show their true potential. 
---
Warriors are reliably top dps though, they are the best class at both dps and tanking, which is probably the biggest screwup in vanilla.
---
you could literally say that about anything at anytime, black lotus will be high in price a little bit in launch then die down. Does that mean its not good anymore? no it's still valuable cause it's still viable.
---
Yes, you don't need the +5 axe for pvp

Orcs are superior in pvp due to their stun resistance racial

You both will have important class quests at 10 in your starting zones.

The 16 debuff limit is pretty much maxed out immediately and whatever spots are left will be filled by corruptions. I want to know if mind flay will knock those corruptions off or even be castable at all.

When I'm raving at EDC and everyone is popping Molly, having a sober friend go around making sure everyone is drinking lots of water for example.  There's having fun, and then there's being irresponsible and dangerous and ending up with a friend losing their life.

Many people refer to spell resistance as spell pen even back in vanilla days. Blue post that mentions how mobs have spell resistance and that it impacts PvE. Not to mention there is a fucking massive amount of info about resistances on mobs in vanilla. I don't get how you act so cocky when there is so much info against you.

/stick, aoe mez, spamming pbaoe. Such good memories. Unfortunately, I just don't think arcane explosion has the damage potential to wreck face in the same way. And you'd need an AOE root to make it work. I've not played mage in vanilla, but maybe a 5-man rotating frost novas and arcane explosions could roll through a zerg. I've never seen it work in WOW. I'd be interested in trying to make it work.
---
The big problem I see is pvp has changed since the days of DAOC. Players are all on voice now, so they don't need to /stick a lead. Zergs present broad fronts. I just don't know if you could pull it off. Maybe with enough +spellpower gear.

I think up until the end of wrath it was always &lt;adventurer and their allies&gt; have beat up x/y/z. The perfect example being the algalon RP in dalaran where you and friends are credited.

Beta is ending in a week why would they give access to people now?

Omg, can someone make this a mod for retail?

I’m sure I had his name right back then! My teacher definitely knew something was up before class officially started he made a point to ask me if I was sure I wanted to present that day

Wait, what? Why are the scrolling combat numbers like retail? Things like this make a subtle but eventually jarring difference in terms of gameplay feel.

does he need druid related quests back in teldrassil or can he do it all in eastern kingdoms?

I played a Gnome warrior in vanilla, started out as arms, dpsing, got Hand of Ragnaros with the support of my friends in the guild.
---
Later, I transitioned into prot warrior and even became one of the main tanks. Tanking in vanilla was fantastic, it was really hard and difficult work to out-aggro the dps, it was a constant struggle, I loved it. As a tank you usually determined who cc'd what, what to focus down first, you decided upon the pace, you basically make or break the dungeon.
---
Being a good tank in vanilla will make you end up in many players' friend lists and you'll end up with a constant stream of people asking you to tank whatever content as soon as you get online.
---
Did you also manage to get the boe epics on agreement or did you have luck with the rolls?
---
I know what you're saying considering I've played since Launch, but I just think it's completely different now. Private servers are proof. It's nearly unbearable to leave chat like that to be honest.
---
The warlock class trinket is called Hazza'rah's Charm of Destruction and gives you 10% crit for 20 seconds. Normally ZHC or ToEP is better but if you can get every warlock to use it at the same time you'll have a pretty much guarantee for ISB to be up and back-to-back SB crits are insanely good. 
---
Unfortunately it requires like 4-5 locks with the trinket and it's a bitch to get it even for one warlock.
---
You can meet up immediately if you want to. If it was me, I would plan to do 1-10 separate and meet up in darkshore after he has bear form and you have defensive stance. We are only talking ~2hours, and I think it’s nice to have those early tools available.
---
It really depends on the semantics of what you mean by a huge chunk. Tier for the most part was good if you were the correct spec but obviously bad if you weren’t. Warrior Tier for example was garbage for fury and since you’ll typically have more fury warriors than tank warriors I guess that made Warrior Tier garbage for a huge chunk of warriors? It was good for Tanks though but that can be said for almost all tier gear. In addition that kinda stuff was obvious, If a priest was going shadow it didn’t take a genius to realize +healing probably wasn’t going to do you much good just like fury warriors could probably figure out pretty quickly that epics with +Defence on them weren’t going to help them do damage.
---
And even if tier wasn’t BiS it was usually good or an upgrade. An example of this is Priest T2 chest, definitely a good chest but just not as good as truefaith vestiments which you can get pre MC. And lastly yea there were some non-tier trash drops like vendorstrike in every raid tier, but there was also stuff like onslaught girdle and cauterizing bad which were very good.
---
yes they are using the old, just higher resolution. they fixed this recently on the beta.
---
You put a lot of work into that. Thank you!
---
DPS Warrior is one of the best DPS classes in the game. 
---
You don't have to be a tank as a warrior at 60.
---
Right. Go outside yourself and act like you do online, unless you live in some white picket fence neighborhood, you'll get the shit kicked outa you. And you'd deserve it. Treat people how you want to be treated and stop hiding online.

I've been putting a playlist together for the past month. Its filled with claasic, 90, early 2000s rap to get me pumped while I gank people.

the 200 honor was only for the very first completion of the quest. repeating it after that was more along the lines of 3-10 honor per turnin or something really small like that. i remember that pretty well because i was ranking on a dead server with shitty bg queues just few weeks before tbc and spammed the fck out it for hours every morning when there were no queues and noone to gank

Thanks for the answer! Was whack a mole so bad as the internet says?

If you think it will exist in phase 2, you are uninformed.
---
It's [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
---
It will, I know Blizzard says it won't,  but it will.
---
Im taking the huge risk to be downvoted by the "no changes" mob. But I am for layering, altough I'd love complete servers without layering I'm gonna be realistic. Without layering you'll be happy to even get online the first 12hours of release. And when u get online you it will take you hours to even leave lvl 5 zones. No one wants that. Sure we didn't need layering back in 2004 but now we do, anyone saying anything different are fooling themselves.
---
With that said, I as well see the problems with layering and would like it to be limitied for lvl 1-20zones and further improved to make abuse of the system viable for gathering and so on.
---
I get that not using layering will bring with it it’s own consequences.
---
But when i compare where and in what way the damage will be done taking into consideration both potential outcomes (server merges vs layering), then i’d much rather go with the approach that’s proven to work with the game: The non layered approach.
---
Does it kinda fail on a tech side of things in regards to population managment? Ya, kinda. But it’s supporting the game by allowing it to be played from Day 1 the way it was intended. Layering is not a necessary evil - a non layered approach is, if you want to see the game succeed.
---
With layering, sure, you have better server management, but you sacrifice weeks or months since launch of the Classic experience for it. You make people play a different game, and say to them “just hold on guys!!” all for the health of the servers, when everyone just wants to get involved with Classic…just Classic. No shenanigans for weeks or months. Players just wanna play the game they expect.
---
Instead of tunnel visioning on server health, What about the health of the community that the game relies on to do it’s magic trick? What about the health of the world immersion that players experience when playing WoW in it’s normal state?
---
Server health matters, to an extent. But it doesn’t trump the importance of player experience within the game at any point.
---
Sharding/CRZ has proven this very, very clearly, as it’s a widely hated approach in this MMORPG - because it destroys community and immersion, the 2 main pillars of this type of game, for the sake of smooth and convenient gameplay, and stable servers.
---
Even to this day, people are really dissatisfied with this “modern” approach to their MMORPG world…of course, because it goes against the premise it’s based on - the “WORLD” of Warcraft.
---
The “WORLD” is Classics appeal summed up in just that title/word alone. Layering is going to disrupt this, and turn this “world” into something else yet again, at a time where Classic’s gotta be Classic the most to convince players to stay…
---
Please don’t repeat the same mistake again. Instead, dare to find out what happens when you don’t push the red button, and observe what happens when you let the game do it’s thing, without any of the tech you already have data on in the modern game.
---
The core audience will play the game if you give them the real deal anyway, so you’ll have the chance to find out if tourists you now expect to leave will actually end up staying because of a full on MMORPG experience, rather than a modern, retail like one.

---
There were some things in WotLK that were not so good, but over all I'd play it again. The lore alone was fantastic. And even though it had 4 fucking modes, ICC was AMAZING, and ulduar (spelling?) Was simply a work of art. As for TBC, I loved every second of that expansion.

Poisons give a huge dps boost.

Always eat as much food as you can before taking Adderall and drink lots of water. Avoid alcohol (dehydration).

Look at this uncompetent casual idiot completely missing the greatest time in arena/pvp.
---
What faction? I’m down to play
---
Can they do layering on a zone by zone basis? I'm cool with layering being active in the 1-30 zones for like a month.
---
if layering doesn’t matter then they might as well remove it.
---
Aren't the players in the video of the old text just critting a lot more?
---
He think it do, but it don't?

Interesting. Naturally I'd want to get my hands on defensive stance asap. I think we're going to quest independently until he gets his bear form at 10, and then link up either in darkshore or westfall
---
If you want warrior go warrior.

It's just slower leveling but it that doesnt matter if you are not rushing to 60 or plan on raiding.

Won't matter how slow you go as long as you are enjoying the time spent playing :)

Not really, you might see a few days difference in 1-60 times for different classes but judging from your post I doubt you’re that concerned with speed.

It's required on blizzards part - it won't matter to the thousands of people crying about it.
---
This is the guy that got fired then followed it up with the dumb idea that beta would be 100% open after closed beta? Why does anyone care about his opinion anymore? God these threads are desperate.
---
K, see ya in borderlands 3!
---
What?
---
there’s a difference between being uninformed and knowing how often blizzards “promises” holds up.
---
Even on private servers most seem completely uninformed about everything. I still see people whining about "summoning stones not working" or don't learn essential spells. We had a warrior the other day who didn't even bother to learn mocking blow. Few know any boss tactics and most are so braindead that they can't figure out that the entire raid screaming your name on Geddon means you should get out of the raid. 
---
Even among good players they are so ingrained in the "normal" way of raiding that if something out of the ordinary happens they are reduced to dog-like intelligence. So many warriors just stand there while the mob/boss is running rampant through the raid killing healers and ranged instead of taunting and putting on a shield.
---
Do you not understand what the word "priorities" means?
---
Play a healer in Vanilla if you want to be the most relied upon person in the game. Raids, BGs, premades will all be loving you and inviting you to stuff constantly. Horde side especially, since there seems to be less PVP healers on Horde.
---
The items are in their 1.12 final state, itemization wise.  
---
Which means a lot of dungeon loot isn't straight up garbage.  
---
But, if the item got added in a certain patch it'll come in the corresponding phase.  
---
Roughly
---
Phase 1: 1.0 1.1 1.2
---
Phase 2: 1.3 1.4
---
Phase 3: 1.5 1.6
---
Phase 4: 1.7 1.8
---
Phase 5: 1.9 1.10
---
Phase 6: 1.11 1.12
---
Exactly what I did. Got a bunch of quests to complete a few days prior and banked them once TBC released.
---
Everyone else was just pvping at the portal and crashing once in TBC.
---
That’s sharding. Layering is continent based.
---
That's what we're gonna do, thanks
---
Please, we're internet janitors.
---
Blizzard if you are listening... your #1 goal needs to be to stabilize and get rid of layering as soon after launch as possible. I know you don’t know what the player base will be and how many sight seers will quit and go back to retail but ...Please if you want to create an authentic Vanilla experience (which so far you have done so well!) don’t let immersion breaking layering destroy all your hard work!
---
You can’t limit layering per zone, that would be sharding.
---
Doesnt matter that you want to hold the classic team to all of "blizzard"
---
The game doesn't work with layering or sharding in phase 2.
---
Anyone who believes layering will be present in phase 2, is just crying about layering because they have literally nothing better to do.
---
Yep, it's actually AMAZING that most game devs don't understand this basic concept even in 2019.
---
Most people don't want to be the hero that saves the world, they want to feel small and the world to feel huge and believable
---
ramen.
---
This is default advice for a first alt, or someone who already plans on tailoring/enchanting (which is by no means a bad combo for a priest), but the idea of spending/farming linen cloth to get a level 5 wand when "wand spec" doesn't really take off until approximately when you'll be able to buy a wand anyway...
---
If someone's selling and you can afford one, by all means buy it, but early levels go by so quickly, and even with layering I expect keeping with/ahead of the curve to be both competitive and advantageous enough that I'd prioritize grinding levels, especially duoing, over farming for a wand before you have talents to support it.
---
What's the argument for it?
---
you do heroin bruh...
---
deja vu, people said the exact same thing with crz in retail. 
---
Sad that it’ll take live gameplay for you to realize the effects, and at that stage the damage will have already been done.

Allow me to rephrase, thanks for bringing it up. People nitpick so hard in this sub.

What i meant is:

The old animation text is one of the major reasons, at least for me, why melee felt so rewarding back in the day. I know I am not the only one. Obviously i doubt anyone created a melee character because they thought the combat animation were the best part of it.  However it surely helped paint a more vivid picture of said gameplay.
---
Just because you personally do not understand the problems, doesn't mean they don't exist.
---
Might be because everyone used a scrolling battle text addon because we all hated the way it originally looked.  A lot of quality of life things in current wow came from addons people built.
---
Pure Laziness.
---
Like others are saying, it definitely existed well before naxx. I remember it was just such a cool environment I was grinding rep there near Caer Darrow before AQ came out.

It never worked like that on pservers or retail vanilla.

Yeah, but that is normalized, so it does the same contribution for the same cast time.

You can run up the mountains in north western Dun Morough, then suicide jump down near Wetlands and get teleported to the spirit resser just outside Menethil. At lvl 1 there is no ressurection sickness and then it is only to run to the harbour and take the boat to Darkshore. If my gf plays night elf I’m doing that run myself as human.

Agreed, I really hope that we might still see a RpPvP server at launch. It would be a shame if Blizzard wouldn't give us at least one per major region.
---
layering wasn't needed 15 years ago
---
Totally 100% against it.

Holy paladin

Why do I feel like this is something that is caused because of Classic being made from Retail. I just genuinely don't know if that's a reason. I just think about it being that way.

You said +5 axes is huge. I'd argue it isn't since there are barely any good main hand PvE axes.
---
Orc stun resistance is op, I 100% agree on that.

    Are you for it? 100%
---
    Are you against it? 0%
---
    How could the current implementation be modified to improve its functionality?  It is already perfect.
---
    What alternatives are there, and are they better, or worse?  The only alternative is a bunch of dead servers, and game.
---
That is true, imo layering and sharding is same same. They just changed the technology a little then renamed is as layering to get rid of the bad stigma sharding had. But yeah to be entirely correct what I want is sharding lvl 1-20
---
And yet all early WoW versions were immense successes to the point where it became a cultural phenomenon of its time, with millions of players up to 12 mill at its peak in WotLK. 
---
That with all the messy launches, low pop realms, and so on. Regardless of the bad experiences, people remembered this game so fondly that it's becoming a thing again 15 years later.
---
This whole server issue is not as big as you make it out to be. It's an issue, yes, and it would be lovely if it could be adressed. But if they want to do it, they have to make sure it's something that doesn't interfere with the game directly. 
---
Any tech assistance has to stay OUTSIDE of the game (like queues for example do), otherwise it damages the core foundations of WoW which it relies on to deliver it's amazing game experience.
---
bump
---
So you’re looking for a class made for PvE that can still do PvP well?
---
That’s kind of difficult, as in classic respecing for PvE and PvP was incredibly common
---
Spriest do really well in PvP as well as decent in PvE, only problem will be finding a spot in the raid.
---
I’d say your best bet is Frost Mage, since no one really re specs to fire or arcane for PvP or PvE, you’d only do fire for like two raids near very very end content when re speccing wouldn’t be a problem at that time at all.
---
In its current iteration I am against it. It should deactivate around 30-35 to preserve world pvp, when it really starts to kick off, and to limit economic exploits. I agree with it at starting zone, the lack of dynamic mob spawns makes the start of the game quite unbearable with mass ammounts of people.
---
Grizzly Hills for [that music and ambiance](https://youtu.be/pWTSK5waNs8).
---
The counter argument to that is that queues are unacceptable in 2019. I think its stupid since its an old game but that's what people say.
---
Right now I'm about 50/50 on the subject. On one hand on launch if it wasn't there I'm sure the wait times would be horrendous trying to get into any of the servers, plus once you get into the starter zones you would be competing with thousands of players for a single quest item or mob. I believe layering is needed just for the starting zones though maybe 1-20. Anything past that is silly, you want the world to be full of people and not feel like a dead server  on launch. I'm only okay with layering if it's only there only for the first week or two, then it should be removed like the plague.
---
but again, your entire assumption is based on the promise of one guy who is notorious for backing from his promises. 
---
Layering is a retail solution to a classic problem. Classic dev team and retail dev team use shared resources, many of the people in leading positions(like Ion) also work on retail. Everything points to them being inclined to continue using retail solutions for classic. When the D day hits in p2 and you’re forced to either put 70% of the pop behind a que or just to keep layering, you can be damn sure that Ion will take the easy option that has worked for them so far, aka continue layering. 
---
I’ve waited a decade for this so I’m not just going to quit because people like you don’t want me to talk about layering.
---
It is tho
---
Lock does very well
---
No difference.
---
Im for it if its limited to: 1 week at max or somehow changed to lvl 10-15 zones max.
---
I don't think the World First level 60 was using drugs, though he got to 60 in about 10 days. If you track him down you could ask him. I don't know if he's still playing.
---
Not at all. Engineering is excellent for tanks, giving more aoe snap aggro at the start of pulls with bombs.
---
Damn that's cool. I want to run WC with him, do you have any advice on the best way to get to WC from darkshore?
---
You should get her animal crossing.  My previous girlfriends hated most games but really love that one.
---
I don't know if there would be much of a market for it, returning players probably won't be interested in an inferior experience and for new players the gameplay loop of mythic+/arena and lfg/lfr + the reduced number of keybinds in BFA is more similar to what you might find in a typical console game
---
Some dungeons are in two parts where the second part is significantly harder than the first. So for instance you can do Deadmines up to Gilnid at level 17-ish for some easy XP and then do the rest at level 20. Same goes for Gnomeregan, SFK, BFD and Stratholme.
---
But you don't need to be an alchemist to use all of the good alchemy stuff, you can get it from a friend or guildmember or buy it from someone else.
---
Nearly all of the useful engineering stuff requires engineering to use.
---
this is a good way to get your girlfriend to leave you fyi
---
Of course people would bring other classes if they did comparable damage. Its hard finding 10+ people of the same class and skill level. Problem is that the fancy smancy class design of vanilla doesn't let all classes at least do comparable damage. Warrs for example are such good damage dealers (and tanks, hey wheres the hybrid tax now HURR DURR) that competitive guilds leech warrs off from other guilds. Some other classes are limited in numbers to the very minimum.
---
Hybrid tax is such an lazy argument. Sounds nice, but let's look at reality: 
---
a) the best tanking class is the best damage dealing class, so no tax here
---
b) every healing hybrid class is so bad with their non healing speccs that they are almost never used in pve, so no flexibility of a hybrid here
---
But yeah tbc is such a sucker RPG-wise, letting people play almost any class and specc they want to and not being forced by other people to stick to healing /s
---
I support this, even though I turn off my floating combat text. I do see the difference after reading the top comments.
---
the waiting room for me has been Teamfight Tactics.
---
No its not, being a casual means you're not puttning in the time required to be the top percentile, it got nothing to do with skill. 
---
The word you're describing is "noob".
---
They have already implemented some sort of cooldown on changing layers on the beta, not sure how it works but it seems to be delayed by combat and other events. So you should not be able to hop layers in pvp anymore.
---
Old text looks a lot better, should report as a bug
---
Kind of. It really just depends on the fight and how many paladins your group is running. You will have assignments for progression/the harder content in general. For MC/BWL it is kinda the wild west. You can use the 3set t1 and healbot for MC i guess, its not good for progression though.The less healers you run, the more responsibilities you have. Certain trash pulls are fun to heal, like goblin tech packs. Others like the big drakonids that war stomp and cause the tanks to spin, not so much. It really just depends on which phase of the content and which pulls you're curious about. I know for packs with lots of widespread moderate damage, renew works well for me. I start casting it on melee targets 3-5 seconds prior to the damage going out. By the time it does I have renews rolling on 3 targets and I just continue to blanket. Im specced PI so its nice to go imp renew and make up for some of the loss from spiritual guidance. Renew usage like that will not work horde-side because the shamans are chain healing the melee groups - use flash heal instead because you are not getting sniped by paladins. Always keep an eye out for an efficient PoH opportunity. I use rank 1 and rank 5. Its expensive but worth it HPM and HPS wise if you can pop one off for 5k. Oh and dont forget to shield if a tank is below 50% long enough for you to process it and ask yourself the question, "should i spend a gcd on a shield right now?" if that question pops up in my mind, the answer is always yes.  
---
just my quick two cents on priest healing
---
Sharding was the better solution IMO.  There was less chance of it creeping out into the rest of the world.  Layering I really worry about.  What was wrong with sharding?  I know people didn't like it, but why give us something worse in response?
---
Ah rip, didnt know that
---
To Meeeeee
---
What's different about them?
---
Farming in winteespring - AFI miss murder.
---
60 tank was, were a warrior or in very specific circumstances a pally off tank.
---
 From there, it was hard, too had stance dance, make sure you were maxing your rage usage and all that.
---
From there tanks were considered gods, because there was a big difference between a good and a bad tank. It required the most skill to play in classic. It's one of if not the most rewarding roles.
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
Did the pala respec or just used what he had ?
---
What level do you suggest meeting up then? I was planning on doing the "run" to human zone on my druid for the rep but this makes me doubt if its worth leaving the NE zones.
---
Ban waves, monitoring of gold transfers.
---
&gt; Layering doesn't do that either. 
---
Yes it does... That's the whole fucking pt kiddo.
---
You severely underestimate players' ability to fill their ranks with better classes that are far and widely more available based on very easily viewable statistics on vanilla class distribution.
---
Iron grenades are borderline overpowered, and I’m going to be slinging around so, so many.
---
Not particularly, you can stay the same for PvP and PvE as a Frost Mage, near end PvE with things like AQ you’ll maybe have to switch as long as you have other fire mages, because you can do the ignite gameplay where one mage does incredible damage and the rest cause the one mage to do amazing damage which can only be done with ignite.
---
For the healers a solid Elemental / Restro Shaman could do well, because they do decent burst damage in PvP (which won’t help in PvE) but they have things such as chain healing and the totem procs which is very valuable in PvE
---
[It's there, yes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bto1jk/two_moons_in_the_classic_beta/)
---
Does anyone not agree?! Now I want to hear it.
---
So then you get an warrior friend and just go killing all this savage hordlings?
---
Doesn't pala have something needed for PvP which is useless in PvE and not speced?
---
I feel personally attacked but also personally out of mana
---
The combat text that floats above your targets head isn’t an exposed UI frame, so there’s no way to edit it or even refer to it. The way scrolling combat text addons work is by disabling the text above your target’s head and then creating their own static UI frame where they put the numbers, but they wouldn’t be able to position it always above your target like the game can.
---
I would pay for TBC too
---
You're all right, sorry. Years passed and in my mind vanilla = mc+bwl. Sorry guys!
---
&gt;Does anyone know what the devs are doing to prevent cheating / external gold buying from commercial enterprises?
---
Not sure why they would share that with us... 
---
&gt;I mean the mount 40 and 60 was a huge achievement in managing your finances, playing the AH is a game some people like to play heavily, the majority of players were 10-25. Now they're 25-40. With money and jobs.
---
There were people that had jobs and families back then in Vanilla and they played just fine.
---
Streamers will have epic riding Months before you - they will have Thunderfury and 10's of thousands of gold to do nothing with... point is - it won't matter.
---
Gold sellers will be in every game (even with a entry fee - a sub) because they have a market.
---
Blizzard will track anyone who buys gold and remove the gold and suspend / ban those players and accounts.
---
All we can do is report the spammers and let blizzard deal with it.
---
The interesting thing is going to be the players that offer retail wow tokens for X amount of gold in classic.
---
I finished all the soulsborne games and just picked up the South Park bundle since it was on sale on the psn store and I must say they are worth the 23.99 for the bundle.
---
WoW Token! Lets get the token in classic!
---
/s
---
Blizzard doesn’t ban you for buying gold anymore. You just get an email where they try to make you feel bad for buying it.
---
My strongest vanilla-memory is listening to Frank Sinatra whilst grinding STV. 
---
For some reason his rendition of Soliloquy has imprinted itself as the theme of my 12 yr wow-newbie experience.
---
It’s a trap. 
---
Her bias to games isn’t about games, it’s about gamers, and it’s one that is likely shared by her friends who will judge you, and in so doing judge her for being with a gamer. 
---
What for her is a passing fancy is for you a hobby. You are gonna have to reconcile this if you are going to fit in to her view of how you should be spending your time.
---
The easiest way to do this to have a designated gaming time where that can be your thing. Otherwise, at the first instance that you seem to prioritize gaming over a social event you’ll start on a downward path where she is doubting your every move and motive. 
---
sincerely,
---
dad gamer
---
Just to be clear, I agree with you 100%. I'm just saying that when I've said things similar, people in this sub swarm it and say it's unacceptable in a modern game.
---
Old damage numbers are part of the reason the combat feels so good and fast.
---
of all the things to fucking bitch about, this is the hill you are dying on? honestly so many bigger issues lol, pick your battles
---
See. I was right. You are an asshole
---
&gt;I don't live in the ghetto. I did grow up there, and I'm glad I did, it taught me respect compared to some spoiled brat like yourself.
---
Apparently not. When did you show me respect? All you have done is offend me and made no arguments towards the discussion. Only ad hominem. I guess the ghetto didn't teach you to listen to other people's opinions (and respect them)
---
&gt;Don't act like an ass if you don't want to be put in your place. 
---
And violent...
---
&gt;Now I probably pay more in taxes than you make a year.
---
And a bully... What if im poor? Is wow exclusive to rich people such as yourself?
---
&gt;But, that's besides the point, and every interaction with you has been pointless to say the least. Take care.
---
Ok man, whatever you say. Hope you can cleanse your heart of all that hate.
---
You do make a great point and I do think (still) there is very much an argument to be made for server clusters, as mentioned in the thread you linked.
---
However - I would argue server health and community health are very much linked. The obvious being that there is no community health when the server is dead. But even before that, as a server begins dying that community starts to fray.
---
But let's delve deeper to clusters, merges and their effect to community:
---
Now say with clusters you proceed to merge. Thanks to clusters, there is no naming conflicts. But merges are very much shocking events to that community and community health regardless. You end up in a situation one usually argues against layering: there is bunch of people running around you've never seen. There are other ways these merges will shock the community, one of them being economy getting broken. And due to the clustered nature of the realms, there will be exploitation of this going on. There are probably others I'm too stupid currently to think of. Of course, how bad the after effects of merges are depends on how long it takes for the merges to be needed.
---
So, far as I can see the difference between the harm in community and the sense of community between these methods, assuming both are needed, layers are removed &amp; servers merged is whether the effect is spread out through the experience or comes as a single shocking experience. With layering you could say the fact that it's probably a somewhat dynamic system you minimize that community harm when people are bleeding off the game a bit better than with clusters, you need to reach a very hard line before you should merge servers. But all in all I'd argue the difference will not be that significant. Also with layering you'll at the very least interact with people in chat.
---
Now immersion: 
---
This is the hardest part when it comes to this issue - immersion is a subjective experience. I personally find people complaining about people disappearing when switching layers, which optimally should be a relatively rare occurence rather silly. People will disappear and appear when logging off already. Mobs will phase in when they spawn and their corpses disappear.
---
To other people, sure, it can take away from your experience. I expect that there will be some jarring experiences when someone your level talks in chat, in an area you are in and you will never see them. But for me that is not such a big deal.
---
There are ways, in which I think clusters are very much the superior option: Blizzard has overestimated or underestimated the population drop. Now in the first case: we were already expecting merges, makes them less painful, even if there could be naming conflicts as they have to merge even non-clustered servers. In the latter case: No need for merges, yay?! Layered servers are in a trouble. Open new realms and free transfers, a system which has problems of its own.
---
Now, I also see an advantage to layering, which I already mentioned: it's a somewhat dynamic system. Meaning Blizzard has more control over how aggressive it is. How many layers you need for realm. Meaning if everything goes well that there won't be that feeling of a dying realm during the bleeding off-phase of things.
---
So, in summary: I'd still likely prefer clusters. There is a chance for pain and gnashing of teeth, but leaves a back door open. I'm okay with layering since community health will take a hit regardless and I can't for the life of me imagine the damage from layering being greater than even pre-planned merge.
---
Sharding is zone specific.  So you can shard all the newbie zones but the rest of the world is one cohesive world.  Layering is the whole world.  If the first layer fills up and you create your character, you are in a whole new empty layer (until others join).  You can see other people if you group with them and stuff.
---
There was a bug and they never fixed it until much much later in like wrath or cata
---
/raid TURN OFF ASPECT HUNTER
---
It is him actually. Also where did you read anger lol! Its ideas like yours that got him fired I'm sure. Open beta would ruin all of blizzard's other plans. It makes 0 sense.
---
For shamans serious optimized PvE is only full resto. 
---
With this a lot of potential from the lighting bolts and chain lighting is not skilled, so the burst would be significantly lower.
---
The healing would be good but a lot of survival methods used by PvP shamans would be less powerful such as grounding totem.
---
Can you double check that it isn’t the Classic style on Beta? Because I’m pretty sure that it is (it’s definitely different than the mainline style).
---
It basicly was, unless you played as launch you would have known ;) It was a total shitshow and something Blizzard has "regretted" of not doing it better for quite a lot of time.  
---
Not that i'm a big fan of layering (or sharding) but both the US launch and the EU launch weren't exactly good in Vanilla, lots of lag, queue's, crashing servers, servers being down for  days in a few instances, for example my EU  account is credited with around 30 "1 Day Exempt" free days due to all the issues Blizzard had.
---
The park, yes.
---
I looked it up, yep should be one there, a mr Sheldras Moontree :)
---
Don't worry, Borderlands 3 is exclusively on the Epic Games Store on September 13th! 
---
Once people try classic and realize they can't hit 60 in a weekend, they'll have something next to their Fortnite icon to play.
---
Gold selling has been happening for well over 30 years in various games. The market is multi million dollar industry varying from currency, to boosts to items to rare accounts/achieves/titles etc etc. It will never stop, good sellers will always find a way.
---
Ah I figured you meant “where do you see priests in the horde lorewise” as in “it doesn’t make sense”. I was mistaken
---
Idk it feels like he's using "former dev" for as much attention as possible, good and bad.
---
It's the W3 Consortium's international date format for the web, and the UTC Coordinated Universal Time. Blizzard's databases most likely have their date fields using this format.
---
I´m pro layering since they did the hopping cooldown. I take long term server health over short term realism. With more servers and merges you would suddenly see players you never met before. With layering you can at least get to know players from the other layers.
---
I really hope they bring the old damage style back, please blizzard, make it happen !
---
Blizzard doesn’t ban gold buyers.
---
I'm against it. The best alternative is to split realms into multiple servers that get merged back together after phase 1. Also, if there is a Jeff on Gorefiend Server 1, someone on Gorefiend Server 3 can't pick the name Jeff. 
---

---
Layering destroys one of the main reasons most of us wanted Classic, one large world with every player in it together at the same time. Classic is supposed to be as close to as it was originally, Blizzard stated this themselves. However, Layering is such a dramatic and extreme change from the way Classic was. We should stick with server queues because that is how Classic WoW operated.
---
most of the people who support the idea in here like it because it’ll get turned off at lvl 20. They think it’s sharding ;)
---
This is a cause I can get behind.
---
Chuck Norris spam is nazism? I must have missed that part of ww2.
---
It takes 6 to 9 hours per week to raid if you are not hardcore. It is not believable that you didn't had time, and unless you have 2 jobs or a job and a &lt;10 years child, you do have time to raid in a serious non hardcore guild.
---
He doesn't. At all. If he does you could stop being a fucking moron and simply say what the source is which was my question to begin with. But I know it's from private servers which means it's worthless.
---
I'm so happy I don't need to interact with you anymore.
---
Avenged sevenfold - city of evil
---
&gt;I like the way this dude berates “US” (I think? He does say you a lot, given we’re reading it he must mean us right? Sorry my autism is acting up, I swear it’s just like having a bung knee, it gets worse when it gets cold and when I read saucy irony on the internet.) about being toxic all the while doing what he hates about people on the internet, being toxic. 
---
I believe he is trolling. It has to be a troll
---
Haven't seen anyone share this one yet. Pretty epic as all of Smooth McGroove's videos are!
---
*vanish*
---
I hope they leave the gold farmers alone so the prices remain cheap.
---
As with spellings, Canada enjoys a seemingly random mix of the US and European date formats.
---
I lucked out. BoEs and general trash drops were needed by all.
---
the classic "everyone but me is stupid" \~ the idiot.
---
yeah that's brutal. good luck!
---
Yes please, blizzard.
---
taking a break lol
---
We were doing pretty well in Wailing Caverns during the stress test and we didn't even have an ideal complement (no cc).
---
skinner here....we dont make shit in BFA. I constantly post the new mats on the AH for lower than anyone else and it still doesn't sell. LW is a joke. The new mount item to not get dismounted by mobs sounds like it should sell for a ton right? sells for 10k...I had to spend 8-9K just to buy the Tailoring item thats a mat for it. So if you count the leather you used to make it as well you're literally going negative by trying to sell them....MAYBE IF IT DIDNT REQUIRE A TAILORING ITEM BLIZZARD....THANKS.
---
It was growing, but the rate of growth was negative.
---
competitive aspect did. During every AWC and MDI people demand class diversity and you can’t achieve it without homogenization and balancing the fuck out of the game
---
&gt; No it doesn't, both Sharding and layering don't prevent a server from losing players and dieing.
---
I might as well try to explain string theory to my fucking dog.
---
This shit isn't complicated...
---
I distinctly remember never blowing cds on mobs haphazardly, always trying to keep my mana up and being always ready to be ganked.  Big key is have that blink and nova off cd when it goes down. And always stay aware and pan camera on surroundings. I prefer to play this way, it makes leveling way more fun to me. 
---
For hunter you basically gotta commit, blink inside his deadzone and stay there.
---
trying being a skinner/lw you literally have no options for gold making
---
10 seconds is probably an overstatement
---
Well, if they do, I have 10 tokens in my bags, a full battle.net balance and 3 more million gold on retail. 
---
Sign me up.
---
I sold a 12-pack for a hundred gold in vanilla 😂
---
I was under the impression you could strafe to avoid dazes as long as your hips were facing the enemy you were fine.
---
When I was raiding in classic I had 2 choices. Restoration for...mainly innervate or the 3% crit aura as Moonkin.
---
It's not layering. The abuse isn't minimal. How can you even make the claim there is no abuse potential? We've seen it already, and it's going to be 10x worse when it's not just a beta test.
---
Did you even play Vanilla WoW back in the day? I went through your post history and you seem like a major Retail player who is hyped up over Classic, so it's understandable if you are confused on certain matters. Asking, not shouting.
---
Yes
---
&gt;  A single Azeroth was the #1 thing I was excited for in classic, now I'm concerned I will never get it. 
---
I don't really understand why layering is any fundamentally different from having multiple Classic servers of the same variety (PvP, PvE, RP, etc.) to begin with - you're still not playing Classic WoW with an arbitrary slice of the total population of players of the game, for a certain period of time: until they turn off layering, or merge low pop servers together.
---
If they *don't* turn on layering, the starting zones are going to be a shitshow for the first 7 days or more, along with whatever zones the zerg of players rushing to max are on in the 2 or 3 established leveling guides.
---
Layering for the first month (and they've unequivocally promised to turn it off after a few weeks to a month), to avoid that initial period of frustration of being unable to find the mobs you need because there's 20 people farming Plainstriders around the Xroads when you get off work every day seems reasonable.
---
They have a credible reason to want to turn it off too, if their explanation that Phase 2 with World Bosses will essentially require them to.
---
Correct. Needless to say, you're not going to want to be running back to stormwind every 2 levels to train.
---
Going through my posts to try and harass me on every one? You wouldn't say shit to me if you saw me irl for one. Two, you're exactly who the right click is for - people who harass others.
---
Huh I didn’t know that. But that is a hilarious fail.
---
Spriest is in my opinion not a hardcore raiding spec
---
Insane dps for the early levels, while not using any mana. Cuts all downtime early on and allows you to destroy mobs by just dotting and wanding them.
---
&gt; Another friend only uses apple products and doesn't want to waste too much money. 
---
wat?
---
Just get an enemy swingtimer to reliably 100% facing them all hits.
---
The same warriors do when out of position trying to get back to their group in PvP.
---
Always jump face them to parry attacks.
---
I played pvp and pve both in entire vanilla. I can’t say that I swapped spec back then tbh. I was probably noobish.
---
Skinning neh, LW yeh. Crafters could've made a boatload of money when the new 340/370 recipes released (because the material cost relative to what people pay was super cheap).
---
What did you see?  Someone getting an extra mithril deposit?  Ohh noo!!!
---
Hyperbolic and pointlessly aggressive comments reek of anger. That's where I read it. And "my idea" was pointing out a normal pattern for game development. I recommend being less emotionally invested in all of this.
---
Ah the good old days where raiders ruled the BG’s and no resilience gear existed!
---
The original point was to address the huge number of people at launch.  Sharding did that.
---
Now the goalposts have moved to include eventual server management.  I applaud them for worrying about the long term health of the servers.  However, the best way to maintain vibrant servers is to be sure to offer as close to the classic experience as possible.  There is nothing more Un-classic than 2 people standing in Org right next to each other that cannot see each other.
---
I am not convinced that we will have ghost towns without layering.  That is an assumption without any way to really prove it.  What we CAN prove is that layering can ruin the Classic experience.
---
There is nothing worse in an MMO than standing next to someone and not being able to see or interact with them.  This is literally the worst mistake they can make in a community based MMO.
---
I made so much money gathering herbs at the start of Legion, I made 40k gph farming Startlight Roses in Suramar. That was a lot of money for me since I did not play since early Cata but later I found out the people buying those herbs made millions of gold doing garrison missions in WoD which makes my gold farm seem funny.
---
It was never a problem for anyone.
---
Gonna get downvoted for this for sure.
---
But a lot of you guys can play what you want and probably end up in a raid. You likely wont end up as a core member in a prog guild as a ret paladin, but you'll definitely end up in a raid if you want to be in one.
---
Theres going to be a lot more people who have never played vanilla that will be playing classic than there will be hardcore veterans returning to it.
---
This means that there will be a lot more people who wont care what you're playing as than there will be people demanding you play min max builds as optimal classes.
---
Of course you can get some sort of raid spot as a boomkin. You're still a shitty guild member for not playing a more useful spec though.
---
Level five would be a waste of time for sure. 
---
On the stress test I made the lesser wand when I was level 8.  Didn’t really go out of the way for linen, and was a bit ahead of the leveling masses.  The wand carries at the low levels.
---
you can’t trade the wow token, so if you want to “sell” it for classic gold it would mean the cost of the token. In other words, “selling $15 value for x classic gold”
---
that’s goldbuying
---
Upvoted
---
&gt;Of course people would bring other classes if they did comparable damage. Its hard finding 10+ people of the same class and skill level.
---
It’s not though at all. This is something we have years worth of experience in retail with when everyone does the same damage you bring the class with most utility every time with out question. If ret Paladins and warriors in classic did the same dps you wouldn’t see a dps warrior other than in bottom tier guilds they would be objectively worse.
---
&gt;Warrs for example are such good damage dealers (and tanks, hey wheres the hybrid tax now HURR DURR)
---
For the vast majority of classic warriors probably have some of the worst hybrid tax. Your guild will bring 1 prot warrior if your lucky, and he will likely end up fury also. Warriors really only have 1 viable spec.
---
&gt;Hybrid tax is such an lazy argument. Sounds nice, but let's look at reality: a) the best tanking class is the best damage dealing class, so no tax here b) every healing hybrid class is so bad with their non healing speccs that they are almost never used in pve, so no flexibility of a hybrid here
---
Already addressed the fallacy that is “warriors have no hybrid tax”, they just fit 2 roles with 1 spec. Healing hybrid classes fit 2 roles both support and healing, if they didn’t you would bring just priests.
---
&gt;But yeah tbc is such a sucker RPG-wise, letting people play almost any class and specc they want to and not being forced by other people to stick to healing /s
---
You don’t let people play anything you build and exact optimal raid comp to buff certain classes, or your leaving so much damage on the table. This was such a problem they had to address and spread buffs and debuffs to other classes post TBC. Ask any competent raid leader from TBC you were benching good players just to get optimal uptime on debuffs and buffs. Vanilla was much more inclusive of different setups than TBC ever was.
---
What exactly you need to do for the quest?

Are you looking for something like this?

---
In order of viablity:
---
There's some pvp priest specs out there that really is fine for pve like PI.
---
SM/ruin lock does well(usually only 1 per raid)
---
The standard hunter pve spec does fine in pvp but it can be improved a lot by going pvp spec. 
---
Deep frost mage can do fine in pvp(only 1 per raid)
---
Meanwhile in the new BFA patch you get a new crafting recipe for....370 ilvl BOE gear. Hooray you can sell something decent....OH WAIT whats that? The new patch literally throws ilvl 385 gear that is easily upgradeable to 400+? Oh cool so my prof is useless kthanks.
---
oh yea i always forget about chicken/sapper OPness. also its pretty godly for tanks.
---
Old ones are better yeah I agree, the difference and the feel is phenomenal
---
Yep. Frozen Shadoweave being our ideal itemization meant we tore up meters in T4 but had pisspoor stamina until we finally upgraded around T6.
---
Roll a caster.. problem solved.
---
Nope - they'll just trade the current price of the token...
---
I support this.
---
I mean twitch emotes are very annoying but they're harmless... And definitely not nazism lol I don't know where you got that from.
---
Speech isn't spam until it gets... spammed. So yea, report it if they're saying the same thing again and again, but if you're gonna report someone for a single stupid "Poggers" then yes you are what's wrong with wow
---
Yea, it works in the beta
---
Blizzard pls bring back old style Blizzard 🙏
---
trust me, layering will make it a non issue
---
&gt;  However, the best way to maintain vibrant servers is to be sure to offer as close to the classic experience as possible. 
---
That's not going to keep the tourists in the game.  Face facts, like 90% of the people that make an account will play very rarely, or be completely inactive.
---
It does and why would it not?
---
LOL Thats a joke they released the 370 recipes then immediately started throwing 385 gear that upgrades easily to 400+ at you.
---
Give it a couple months.. tokens will be enabled.
---
Escaping World PvP at any time
---
Devilsaur Mafia across all layers
---
Farming Black Lotus massively with multiple layers, after rushing to 60.
---
Hitting Level 60 in 3 days with AOE farming.
---
Farming chests and rares massively.
---
These are the main problems. Layering = screwed server economy no matter what.
---
Grenades in actual vanilla were not harder to hit, in fact Nostalrius grenades were WAY harder to hit than actual vanilla grenades. There's tons of clips from actual vanilla of people hitting 2 people like 10-15 yds apart with the same grenade lol.
---
Please try, since your explanations aren't making a lot of sense up to now. The sooner ppl understand that layering is basicly sharding but on a larger scale the better. both have very obvious drawbacks. Sharding has a "bad name" though from retail, so Blizzard put some make up on the pig, changed the name from sharding to layering and all of a sudden its great! Please don't fall for this bullshit marketing and see through it.
---
To any one that watched Korean pvp videos - Sum 41
---
Thanks!
---
so you just want to trade gold in retail for gold in classic? Good luck finding compatible servers for that
---
I didn't say the average buyer was smart.
---
No links, no sources, no arguments. No thanks bud
---
Oh dang, that sounds like a big change to make on such a big scale. Thanks for the detailed reply :) this is interesting stuff
---
No I think he meant arcane. Arcane would mean that it is hard to understand/decipher. Archaic would mean that it old fashioned/outdated.
---
upvote to the moon
---
Arcane would mean that it is hard to understand/decipher.
---
Horde low level quest in Durotar.
---
You put 20,000 players onto a single server.   They're split up into multiple layers. 
---
Ideally you want about 3,000 concurrent players online at one time. 
---
The issue is that a large % of the players are going to leave.  Say 70% of the players will be inactive with 2 months.  
---
That leaves, 0.3 * 20,000 = 6000 players still playing the game.  Those 6,000 players will then be put onto a single layer/server.  Layering will be turned off.
---
It had fewer players and already loads of shitty problems due to overpopulation 15 years ago
---
Imagine WOD launch but 10 times worse if they didn’t use layering. In WoD you couldn’t play properly for 3 days after release.
---
Without layering the launch would crash and burn. Everyone would cry about Blizzard not doing anything about it, just like they are crying about layers now.
---
People are never satisfied.
---
Luckily it would be extremely temporary. We've waited 10 years for Classic Wow, some of us even more. Waiting a little bit longer is no problem. Try to see past the immediate, temporary concern and look to the big picture of what Classic WoW is.
---
Integrity of the experience &gt; Selfish instant gratification
---
how so? 
---
a lot of players won't return for a remaster especially not for 15$ a month.  
---
they're not going to gain new players to archaic mmo's so you're looking at max 4 mil players which is around what vanilla had.
---
I loved having pallies and boomkins in my guild. Being willing to tank/heal 5 mans that you didn’t need to help out the guild &gt; someone doing double or even triple your damage in an encounter. At the end of the day it’s a 40 man raid for content that is regularly cleared on hard mode on pservers. You’ll at LEAST see bwl and Mc as any class if you get pre BIS and know your shit, and you’ll probably go a lot further if you’re friendly, helpful to newbies/alts, and overall dependable.
---
The reason there is a layering is two-folded: firstly it would be really bad for a video game in 2019 if you would have to queue to get in. Secondly, it would be really expensive to keep x amount of servers online all the time. X beign the max number of players playing the same time. 
---
Thats why it is cheaper and more convenient to "layer" the server dynamically, so people dont have to queue for the servers and they will have other players to play with.
---
I am not for or against layering. There are real downsides and possible ways to exploit the thing. In the other hand me myself cant come up with any better way to answer the guestions layering is set up to answer. Best thing is to hope that player pop stabilizes quickly and the need for dynamic layers is no longer needed.
---
Post on the WoW classic forums
---
No worries, best of luck. 
---
If I wanted to max rep gains, I would immediately group up and try to get the quests done with less total exp earned from mobs, so that I could do more zones without overleveling the quests. Doing that, you could maybe get the first 2 phases of darkshore done by say, 14 (normally, you leave the last of the quests in darkshore for the return voyage). 
---
Then swing through a good part of loch modan on your way to westfall at 16. 
---
Did you specifically want a horse? what's the motivation behind maxing human rep specifically?
---
&gt;&gt; fixed, and largely overblown to begin with. Most people don't have a cult following to use to try to escape being ganked. Anyone that would go through the trouble of this will just play on pve servers
---
Not fixed. 
---
&gt;&gt; Mafia only works because of crossfaction agreement, which is against TOS. Also, how is this different than multiple servers? Having 1 group try to control 5 layers is going to be a lot harder than having 1 group on each server. If anything, layering makes this better, because you can use it to try to avoid the mafia.
---
Ah a retail player. I should have known. Clearly completely unaware of how the Devilsaur Mafia actually works, and how layering helps people farm even more leathers/control the prices.
---
&gt;&gt; Again, how is this different? 5 layers vs 5 servers. Amounts to the same thing.
---
No it doesn't, because 1 person can't abuse layers to farm Black Lotus massively after no lifing AOE layer abusing to level up fast.
---
&gt;&gt; Nothing compares to the dire maul farming exploits, but I am guessing you aren't wanting that changed.
---
Actually this isn't true. You are limited to 5 instances per hour, but with AOE farming layering abuse you can make more money than in DM:East.
---
.
---
It's always funny debating a clueless retail player who only has google search + twitch streamers making 10,000$ USD per month or more to base his views off of.
---
Again.. You do not seem very smart, might be something with the 420 in your name
---
On my server back in the day there weren't that much of roleplaying going on when suited up in armour, e.g. In raids &amp; dungeons.  
---
Most of the time when roleplaying was 'active' were in "RP gear", your favorite colored shirts and all.  
---
It was a healthy population of RPers and PVPers(?) on our server and never did I, nor anyone I know ever feel that there was a clash between the two.
---
to each there own. But speaking of ashenvale i always love doing that quest where you escort some orcs to raid a night elf base!
---
If you're non-optimal, you'll probably have no problem getting into the lower tiers of raids.  If you want to push Naxx and AQ40 at release, you probably won't be invited as a non-meta spec.  That's at least my take.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuRgotVMtMMh
---
Here's a sample PVP spec. You can move points between Imp. LOH, Imp. BOW and Lasting judgement depending on what your raid needs. 
---
&gt;Doesn't pala have something needed for PvP which is useless in PvE and not speced?
---
Sure they have, but there are enough talent points in total to get every good PVP talent while still having everything you need to raid. All depends on who else in your raid takes talents to improve blessings, judgements and auras.
---
LULW
---
Dems da breaks bro....
---
lol dont tell me your one of those dicks ganking me from ontop of the inn
---
Ooo that is awesome. Definitely 100%
---
I would just stop arguing with this guy. He's a braindead retail player who is at this point straight up trolling.
---
Nobody likes doing 300DPS per 2hand swing, because you dont have the gold or time to get an Arcanite Reaper or the time for a BRE/Spinal Reaper and run around with 15% critchance in berserker stance.
---
A frost mage spitting R1 frostbolts and blizzards keeping the enemy team at bay is an essential asset to a premade sometimes doing only 500damage in a minute while contributing to the win.
---
A warrior without good gear is literally deadweight and is as ignored as a retardin, because he lacks the one thing that makes him an opponent: damage.
---
Ion said about 2 months for Phase 2 to Phase 3.
---
25th
---
Things chaaaange maaaan
---
And Blacksmithing. Being able to make the pure BiS plate helm for all of classic, from day 1, is very nice for money making.
---
Why don't you see past your immediate concern then? They said they'll turn of layering after a few weeks at most.
---
Damn thats sick! What questline is it? I want to do it lol.
---
Well it's more of an embarrassing thing now I look back, but I just kept hearing the guild I was in saying they were farming mats and gold for their raid and I never thought to ask.. Till I went to a farm in northshire abby or elywyn forest, and just looted what ever intractable objects there were.. Probably for an hour (mabey two), made about 2gold and then thought I may be doing something wrong...
---
I was smart enough to ask someone to show me their favourite farming spot, and then just dropped into conversation, 'so just killing loads of mobs, is that what you mean by farming?' thankfully he didn't ask what I thought it meant
---
yes I went to a farm to farm, it is so stupid now but something you can laugh about
---
Most classes, not druid or paladin.  
---
Paladin has to be forbearance, with tongues a close 2nd.    
---
Druid is a little harder to say.  Maybe kidney shot.
---
Considering 2k likes and donations are going out within 10hrs.. it's likely. Blizzard actually reads our shitposting. Just hardly acts on it till desperation sets in.
---
I wish i had that mindset. I'm always stuck playing horde cause of my friends haha.
---
I have, in vanilla :) This time around im just more about questing with friends, plus id like to get a horse on my NE aswell, so i dont mind leaving Teldrassil behind. 
---
I do agree its a great place to quest though (minus the furblog cave)
---
Putting your self through physical pain to extend your virtual penis is a mental illness, yes.
---
Putting your self through physical or mental pain to extend your virtual penis is a mental illness,
---
I always felt blacksmithing made too few useful items early on and with items being more scarce than retail itd really help flesh it out.
---
Mining ores went for 250g per ore for the new stuff during the first 12ish hours of 8.2. Now they're already down to 15g a pop.
---
Ya this is not going to work at all lol..
---
I understand the desire for server queues.  But how long does the average wow player have to game every night? Four hours to six hours after work? 
---
I'm just worried people are going to get hit with massive queues if they have a lean realmlist like Ion said. Then that would turn people away from game. It would suck if people who wanted to try out classic again after so long are scared away by massive queues.
---
We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8PPTz3q), over here. I say we, as I intend to be rolling on that server.
---
Probably the best way to mitigate it and also put the money into blizzards pocket. 
---
Not OG Vanilla #nochanges but a lesser of two evils perhaps
---
&gt;Did you specifically want a horse? what's the motivation behind maxing human rep specifically?
---
I played NE aswell in vanilla but never got around to getting a horse mount. 
---
This time around i just thought id plan for it and every rep guide says the best way is to start immedialty questing in the faction zones you want the mount from.
---
I could always try and just go pvp rank 11 but it just felt easier swopping zones instead.
---
Yes.
---
Because OP gives a shit about what you deem as the only way to play... forgot, my bad!
---
Sheep the hunter and kill the pet? You are so wrong
---
If you don't mind, i'm just gonna leave this clip here from one of the Vanilla WoW game designers, who in this clip talks about why players are really bad at choosing their own emotional experiences (which i think is also related to the topic of layering)
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/PoisedClumsySpiderANELE
---
It may not feel good while the queue is there. But i think it's worth it overall to sit through it, to get the game we've been asking for for many years, in an unaltered state, right from launch.
---
I am for layering because it will be temporary. We don’t want tons of quitting because of a miserable experience. If it weren’t temporary then it would be a big deal but it’s a temporary solution to a big problem.
---
We'll see - until it's in a blue post - can't really ship it.
---
Ive been playing a classic pserv an levelling a mage, the amount of +frost damage items you can make when you hit silk is disturbing. It  almost makes getting robes of argul redundant if you are levelling via AoE farm
---
Of course no one thinks layering is good.  It is just that no one has come up with an alternative that doesn't cause more harm on launch(population levels that are too high, and not reflective of any vanilla server launch) or less harm but harm would continue past phase 1(capping servers artificially low, then when people quit have half the servers be dead).    
---
This guy has really good ideas, but I want to hear from him as a game dev and not a game critic.
---
But it is temporary.
---
Yeah I'm a little confused about this entire thread tbh. So much misinformation flying around.
---
Personally I think it'd be very legal and very cool
---
Release 3 versions of every server (eg. Illidan A - B - C) and then merge them into one (eg. Illidan) once the tourists have gone away.
---
&gt; Restrict character names across all 3 versions so there would be no issues with naming once the merge has happened.
---
&gt; Link Auction Houses between the 3 versions so the economy wouldn't be impacted much once the merge has happened.
---
This literally solves every problem layering is attempting to fix:
---
* Accommodates for the influx of tourists
---
* Cuts down queue times
---
* Avoids dead servers in the future by merging the three versions into one
---
and it eliminates the downsides that come with layering such as ruining immersion, exploiting resources, and dodging world PvP.
---
AND even better, if tourists don't go away then you wouldn't need to merge.
---
You can leave them as stand alone servers since they will effectively have healthy populations.
---
If tourists don't go away with the current "solution", then layering will have to persist even after Phase 1.
---
I bought gold all through vanilla 14 years ago and it was completely fine. I got through most of naxx but still had time to do whatever I wanted between raids, it's what made the experience great.
---
Nobody ever accused me of ruining the game, in fact I don't think anyone noticed or cared.
---
There will be tokens and lootbox mechanics in Classic as soon as year 3 hits.  Maybe before.
---
People that wish to play without layering already have the option to do so. Since layering will be removed, just wait until they turn layering off and you will never have to deal with it.
---
thank you for the info! hopefully we’ll get an official realm or two!
---
It matters when PvE gear is PvP gear..no resilience..u can have a fresh faced 6days played 60 in FULL BoE epics.
---
Then you play pvp and get face rolled by some cunt who didnt deserve any of the gear because he bought it externally to earning it in game.
---
This can happen on a way larger scale than I'm vanilla before. Not to mention inflation, $15 now vs $15 15 years ago..every kid and their dog can have thousands of gold. And they take ur raid slot, organized pvp slot, dungeon slot..because people generally want to play with better geared players unless a common friendship already exists.
---
Good to know the sexism is alive and well in WoW. Sigh.
---
They didn't do that back in the day either. I bought thousands of gold during 2005 and all I ever got was a warning. The gold sellers got banned though.
---
Calm down crazy
---
But you can keep those friends since your on the same server and play during and after layering is removed.
---
It's all about luck man, I have Ash on my alt hunter.
---
It involves climbing a tower doing rogue-y things to defeat enemies and then killing the named mob at the top and getting his head. The tower climb usually isn’t a problem since the mobs are kill credit so you can group with other rogues, but the named mob requires a drop
---
You're not going to get true vanilla. You never will. As long as there's an honest attempt made and they stay true to the original design principles of vanilla (server communities, talent trees, sense of progression, ect.) then that's the best we can hope for. If you want a 1 for 1 recreation of classic then you need to build yourself a time machine.
---
Actually it was, vanilla launch was a disaster.
---
It is what it is.  Take it or leave it, they have made it clear that is the route they are going to go, and there ain't enough time left to change it.
---
Whoa dude like, totally. I wish they'd give it to all the player requests for different flavored servers, that way we could have more server types than we have players and we'd all be able to play alone. Totally tubular dudez
---
The first few times sitches gets spawned will be glorious.
---
It's only expensive to level from like 250 onward right? I know I'm on a (redacted to not get banned) server but Mithril bars are relatively cheap on a fresh start (1g 50s per stack of 20). Obviously Thorium is going to be expensive. What level of Engineering do you need to make the good shit?
---
Holy priest can shadow weave as well as a shadow priest. There is no difference in uptime when it comes using your lowest mana shadow spell.
---
The ‘selfishness’ can be argued both ways. Many people have waited years - many people want to try it out. A large drop in population is expected, adding a long queue or adding HUGE competition for mobs at the spawn will only add to that. Assuming there is a 10,000 person queue for one realm, many of those people will become annoyed by the wait or the competition on the server and will quit. Fast forward a month and the server no longer has a queue and a declining population.
---
OR you have layering, with all its cons of ruining integrity and some possible exploits. 10,000 people can play simultaneously on layers without having to fight to tag every single mob. Fast forward a month, the layers are gone and it’s a healthy server population and might have a queue if so many people end up playing
---
exactly! it seems like a lot of people think there will be rpers trying to rp in dungeons or raids. it'll only be in the ''rp areas'' of cities, and if you see it out in the world, it's probably bc two people agreed to go out and rp at that spot
---
We raided a lot in vanilla. 3 times per week. Progression raid for sure. But it’s was not very hardcore. Some guildies were pretty good and hardcore but the majority was not at all. 
---
We struggled and we progressed. 
---
We eventually completed MC. It was a thrill.
---
When we entered black wing lair or whatever it was called we were obliterated. We did not manage to kill a single boss in there and it ultimately broke our guild apart slowly. We raided also a little bit in tbc but I think we got mortally wounded in black wing lair and never recovered. 
---
So in conclusion most players can progress at vanilla raids but the hardest raids is close to impossible to mange for less than hardcore elite players.
---
He's the Game Director for World of Warcraft... he doesn't publish Blue Posts, he tells other people to do that. His word is god.
---
And? 
---
They aren't letting people use a wow token in classic... but they *might allow friends to trade gold in classic for gold in retail.
---
Nobody knows until blizzard says something OR we going to sizzla because people will trade classic gold for wow sub.
---
I feel like this is something where you can do it. But Blizzard is not going to give you the gold back if you get scammed.
---
Leveling my level 48 hunter in Tanaris
---
See ya in 8.3!
---
He asked a question and I answered the way I deem correct.
---
I personally would not find it fun to play an underpowered class that sucks at what it's supposed to be doing best: damage.
---
A warrior without gear is exactly that: a shitty damage dealer in PvP that will be ignored by not only your opponents but also your faction.
---
Why try to keep alive that shitty 3,8k health warrior with Ice Barbed Spear when you can follow that BRE wielding wrecking ball?
---
Yeah, in that case, it may be worthwhile to take a much worse leveling path just to max rep gain in stormwind. 
---
I would definitely try to group up a lot so that I didn't have to kill as many mobs for the kill quest though: it's actually tough to do all the quests on private servers without greying any of them out, unless you deliberately avoid grinding even when it makes sense to do so.
---
Quest in Durotar where you kill a goblin warlock bastard whose surrounded by like 5 or 6 other tough mobs. Its nasty.
---
Inb4 thems the breaks tho
---
I bought some during Mists (think it was 2013).
---
Wasn’t worded as a warning either, more like: 
---
«Please keep in mind that the gold you buy from gold selling sites might be stolen from other players, and that sucks for them. Imagine if that were you...»
---
Of course it sucks when people are hacked for their gold, but in my experience gold is also made in non-malicious ways. Anecdotal, I know, but my friend sells gold (small scale) that he gets from selling raid/mythic boosts in BFA.
---
Nah you responded to what I said - enjoy getting upset over little things in classic!
---
Your mentality is actual cancer and is dragging down entire game communities.
---
Fuck the quests in Faldir's Cove tho unless you have enhanced water breathing
---
Passive aggressive entitled. Classic ally scum.
---
Answered you above btw :3 &lt;3
---
While I understand the sentiment, I think (purely opinion) the vast majority of players do not want to wait hours on end. Many people enjoyed WoW and want to try this out again because they loved the experience before. Having long queues at the start prevents people from becoming invested in the game in the first place. I think layering (short term) allows everyone to dig their feet into the game and it’ll be gone by the time they’re addicted
---
[This](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=806/dark-storms). A low level requirement quest (you can get it as early as lvl 4) but hell, the guy's 12 with an imp pet and surrounded by other mobs, most being casters with their VW pets.
---
If not hopefully someone can mod them in.
---
I read somewhere that Blizzard just gives out suspensions instead of bans. Supposedly it leads to less repeat offenders.
---
Can't get back on if I never left
---
It's a route we can probably take if the classic community is vocal about the direction of the game. When battlegrounds is coming, that is the time to speak up about it. But at the beginning, world pvp will dominate.
---
#nochanges my man. That was sarcasm. It will kill the game.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
I keep seeing this and I always read it so I never went with Engi. But right now I don't know what is so expensive besides Thorium bars 250-300. Do you even need Engi that high for anything? Not being a smartass, I genuinely don't know. Mithril isn't too expensive. So far my most expensive crafting has been using Heavy Stones which is unfortunate but they aren't too bad by any means.
---
I smile when I think about this. 
---
I was in my early 30ies back then. Still full of life and lust etc. 
---
I remember some of my guild mates. Some sexy looking teen girls posting pictures in guild forum etc. 
---
Then a couple of months ago me and a mate did a Facebook search of 3 or them. Holy shit they had fallen from grace one could say hehe. 
---
Not that me and my mate are as “cool” as we used to be but somehow I don’t think I would be thrilled to raid with my old guild mates again lol. 
---
My mate was equally shocked and we went on to watch YouTube videos of Brittney spears best years for that sweet nostalgic feeling lol.
---
It's the worst thing about layering in my opinion.  Right when they plan to get rid of it they will be introducing battlegrounds, making the entire first phase not as epic as it should be with world PvP.
---
People been coming up with a whole array of ideas, but people just downvote it or gets removed...
---
Apparently i dont know how to hashtag on reddit
---
There was no hyperbole? Your missing left and right with this troll attempt
---
Private servers have a lot more bots and low level characters, so raw material prices should be much cheaper on them.  In 6 months when most people are 60, stuff like copper and iron will shoot up in price as few people are farming them.
---
Also, the main advantage of engineering is the bombs, which are an ongoing cost. Its not just leveling it, you will constantly be pouring gold into buying more consumables.
---
But that's hardly an objective way to look at it. A game with 5 million players has a much bigger potential pool to pull from than a game that already has 11 million. Growth slowed in large part because the game already sucked in a larger audience than any MMO could have reasonably hoped for.
---
The fact that Wrath maintained its initial numbers to begin with is a sign of success.
---
True, but having the new does DOES make combat less enjoyable for melee, because the damage text is made for a game where auto attack damage doesnt matter any more.
---
They NEED to revert this.
---
Yea, I was in the top 20 to hit 70 on our High Pop server in TBC.  No stimulants, just micro naps.   We then cleared the heroics needed, and were attuned and downing I think Moroes before the first reset in Kara.  Might have been the third boss.  But we were the second ten man on the server to clear Kara, that I do recall.  But when people eventually caught up and we could do 25 mans, the guild fell apart as people were left out after dropping from 40-25 raids.  Sad.  TBC killed a lot of fun Vanilla guilds.
---
With power infusion /shadow weaving you don't get a single point in the holy tree - your healing effectiveness is the same as someone with 0 talents point spent. You just have a bit better mana pool/regen and slightly cheaper instant cast spells. That sounds pretty damned gimped to me. I have no idea what you mean by getting another prayer of healing - the only talent that effects that spell is in the holy tree.
---
I wont raid much, but i will play the best spec for my class. I dont have much time to play because i work and have kids, thus my approach to classic will be casual. I will still have time to research and still get my pre-raid bis, and ive played wow for 15 years at mythic level equivalent for all expansion so I'll know what im doing.
---
I will be casual but i sure as hell wont be a noob. There's a difference.
---
Lost my browser for some reason and all I typed, so just summarizing:  
---
* Don't like layering, don't want layering, but know it's probably here to stay and have to deal with it the way it is.
---
* Best alternative I can think of are reserved servers, pay a $10 slot reservation on a server that has no layers on launch.
---
   * Only those that reserved can play on it, allow those that are on it to pay $10 more to invite a friend in post launch.
---
   * Open it up if pop dips too much, or phase 2 - whichever comes first.
---
   * Queues on the servers after opening to general public, those reserved have priority access.
---
   * Some benefits are
---
      * Better controlled server population
---
      * More likely to get those that are interested long term on reserved servers
---
      * Prevents player / streamer zerging
---
      * Makes those that don't want layers happy
---
   * Some downsides are
---
      * Probably would need a good 100,000 people to do so to make it worth Blizzard's time
---
      * $10 paywall.
---
"why the fuck did Blizzard only make 4 vultures spawn in Redridge Mountains when you need to kill 70 and there are 30 people sharing them?"
---
"why are the turtles in dustwallow dropping the quest item at a 10% rate when you need 8 of them and the quest only rewards 1/9 of the xp you get for killing the turtles themselves?"
---
Nothings a problem after the first few hours. The first few hours *are* the problem.
---
I do too when they’re just standing or running. But their eviscerate/jumps/stealthing sucks
---
Nice buzzword but you have no idea what your talking about. It's not blizzard or old dev's that the sub doesn't trust, its everyone. No one  can make classic plus content well which is why the sub doesn't want it.
---
There is no equivalent in wow. The idea of the close range glass cannon that does massive damage just isn't a thing.
---
wasnt there a meme revolving around the sand?
---
Could be. WF totem can proc off on abilities like Sinister Strike.
---
Im gonna play with a group of friends so shouldnt be a problem at least with killing as little mobs as possible heh.
---
That's all pretty counterproductive.  The best way to marathon raids like this is actually to eat healthy, not cram a bunch of sugar into your diet.  There's no way you'd be able to go on.
---
Single target yes. Aoe? No
---
My little bro is my tank, nil prob. If he needs we will fill without a Hunter.
---
Yep...this.
---
Actually it cant. You are dead wrong.
---
The way addons display text is very different to the way the standard combat text works. An Addon can only draw text on a 2D surface. The Blizzard combat text display numbers with a position in the 3D world.
---
This issue CANNOT be fixed with an addon. Stop saying it can, because it just mean people will stop asking Blizzard to fix it.
---
Casual is a mindset, not a time equivalence.  You play WoW sparingly, not casually.
---
Is this tirade about how "I play casually" is synonymous with "I don't care"?
---
I hope so.
---
I don't see how that's "the other way around."  I wasn't stating anything was right or wrong.
---
What addon showed "new records" for each spell? That sounds amazing and I must have it.
---
Really depends on how good you are marketing it and what dungeons you run.  
---
I specifically did undead and not live, because both healers and DPS need stuff (Robe of the Exalted + Cape of the Black Baron + Mask of the Unforgiven). In strat: live rarely does a healer really farm that place, except he wants to go the extra mile for Truefaith Vestments or Archivist Cape.
---
But in undead lots of people accept it gladly as there are no tank items in undead and the others are looking for tanks all. the. time.
---
Also that place can be a right nightmare with a tank not versed in pulling together the non elite undead packs, pulling the gargs at the right time, corner pulling all them socerers. 
---
Good tanks make or break undead.
---
Because the game is "free" for people paying for retail, so most of them will make an account.   For everyone else, the cost is only $15.   So, they'll play a little, then the nostalgia will wear off.  
---
Basically, most of the people that make an account won't stick around.  Heck, even on the private servers, only like 30% of the people stick around.
---
I'm not talking about carrying. A group of level 18s can face roll DM. Same thing with Scarlet Monastery. You'd be more than fine going 3 levels under OP's numbers. 
---
Of course higher level players will make it even easier, but that's not what the post is about.

---
Other people being happy is the knock on affect of being fair and up front prior to the run.
---
It doesn’t really matter which comes first, the month without the date is as useless as having the date without the month.
---
Isnt there an addon for this? Never checked it because i dont really care about it,but i am pretty sure someone made something to fix this.
---
Because the way an addon display text is different from how the regular combat text draw text to the screen.
---
This cannot be fixed with an addon.
---
It's a cvar you can toggle.
---
idk, that certainly seems like it would work as well.   You would have to ask blizz why they chose layering over mass sharding.
---
As long as you're trying to RP when using emotes and /say, no one should get pissed off at you. If you're nervous about interacting, Rpers are perfectly chill with observers to their scenes.
---
*Shift* 1 for wand? I see you were a higher breed of intellect.
---
Bats are all over the place outside UC.
---
I don't know but I'd assume it'd knock a random dot off, or possibly the slow doesn't work. Just failing to cast sounds completely ridiculous.
---
Vanilla wow started with tens of thousands of players, and grew to millions.   Classic wow will start with millions, and decline to tens of thousands.
---
Alright bro. Next time there's some issue that affect YOU but not anyone else I hope you are fine with being told to stop bitching.
---
This issue is very important for a lot of players. The way combat text is displayed is a huge part of what makes Vanilla \*feel\* like Vanilla. They absolutely have to change this.
---
I think these levels are fine for random pugs. A dedicated group could do most of these pretty comfortably 1-2 levels lower.
---
Just wait until you're mid 20's so you can level your lockpicking prior to ~100.
---
Then just get a vendor white dagger or some grey garbo, ambush the elite and then just weapon swap.
---
I don't think you can group for it since the chest at the top needs to respawn OR you need to loot a single drop quest item from said level 24 elite.
---
Its not hard either way and give you enough lockpicking skill to do SM pick pocket runs to get to 175 picking.
---
Lol, you are more than welcome to stay in private server communities where you can don your fedora, stroke your neckbeard, and try to explain to people how Facebook is infringing on your freedom of speech for not letting you use the n word like a super cool edgelord.
---
Alright bro, because the white numbers start stacking and crits stop popping out when you hit level 70?
---
No they dont, so stop bringing up irrelevant shit.
---
So you're saying that ganking should be bannable. lol
---
I remember doing it a few times, but when there wasn't any PvP to be had with it? Dropped.
---
What rambling junk did I just read?
---
In which xpac did theu remove them? Cuz I remember in pandaria they were still there
---
Maybe, depends on how much elitism prevail with noobs and pugs
---
i don't like it because it gives blizzard more excuses.
---
say phase 1 is winding down and all the tourists and looky loos haven't left. every server is crammed with 25k players, with layering in full swing. what's more likely - blizz opens new servers/allows transfers, or blizz makes a sappy post saying "we didn't want layering to stay but we have way more passionate wow fans than we expected, layering will have to stay for phase 2, get those world bosses!"
---
i know it's necessary for launch, but i wish they would un-"lawyer-speak" the information surrounding layering. all this "we hope" and "it should be" just makes my mind jump to the worst case scenarios.
---
I have played on private servers too.   I haven't seen the mafia personally, but what they are doing is not exactly complicated.
---
Well while leveling you really don’t need to spec resto to heal dungeons. You really only have to commit to optimization at endgame. So you could level a kitty-centric spec all the way if you like!
---
Birthday cake, large fry, chocolate shake
---
Yes, but making an addon to have the text behave like it does on the 1.12 client isnt possible. Which is why Blizzard has to take action.
---
&gt;No. Not possible.
---
It's not possible to emulate the old behaviour with an addon.
---
No you haven't.
---
Other crafting profs can buy mats off the AH, craft them into something, and then sell those crafted items and make a profit, essentially.
---
Engineering can be useful in PvP, but you have to buy the mats for the consumables, and grenades and stuff like that you can’t make a profit off of.
---
An enchanter can make money just standing around in a main city and not moving.
---
except the econ will be fucked because players got to play on dead layers solo farming continents. how about everyone for layering fucks off, back to retail where they can play there shitty looter shooter 6 people to a server instanced adventure.   
---
how about actual populations on an MMO??? how about my launch event? why don't you fuck off for 2 months on release then come in when queue times and starter zones are done with? then you can play for a week realize you're not getting your 15 minute dopamine fix and go jerk off till the next patch for retail comes out?
---
He never even mention "p2 to p3" or  "about 2 month". Or where did he say what you claim?
---
Hunter here, I agree. Sometimes it isn’t as simple as the math between weapon choices.
---
Haven't played on private servers?  lol.   It's not exactly hard to do...  My top char is only like 30 though.
---
Ah alright thanks, I just read something about a mil. a few weeks/months ago.
---
As someone who played all stress tests, as well as being a private server player I can tell you right now that combat feels totally different due to the way numbers are displayed on screen.
---

Still wouldn’t trust a group leader with master loot. I don’t know this guy, he might fuck me over. And if he needs the same loot as me I can forget about getting anything.
---
Ludicrous*  (sadly) a common mistake.
---
No there isnt. Stop spreading nonsense and misinformation.
---
My favorites are all the horde zones; tirisfall, silverpine, durotar, and the barrens.
---
Lol... Black teas definitely do have ple ty of caffeine.  Herbal and oolong teas do not.
---
That's a fun story, made even better by having a journal entry for it you could type out and share with us!
---
Oh no. A game that will have no changes for years is going to have a bad economy for a few weeks. The horror.
---
Not if your a Prot Warrior!
---
There is not a single spec that has the exact same talent points for perfect PvP and perfect PvE. There is always room for improvement in one direction. However, the specs mentioned here can perform at 90-95% in both PvE and PvP instead of performing 100% in one area and only 70% in the other.
---
Edit: To answer your question: Yes, some points will be slightly different.
---
No it's not lol. No reason to state things you know are not true. An Addon cannot emulate the behaviour of the original 1.12.1 combat text.
---
Yep i feel the same as you. Horde zones are much better
---
I can smell the entitlement all the way over here. This game is made for more people than you.
---
No offense but even if I didn’t need it, I would need on that. It sells for a huge amount of gold and imo everyone deserves a chance at that. You don’t absolutely need it as a druid either, you can get a blue staff.
---
The harder you have to work, the more valuable your achievements are. Hitting 60 or getting a piece of gear is way more meaningful if you had to walk to the dungeons and your leveling experience was tougher. Convenience makes your achievements much less meaningful as they were handed out easily to you and that means the rest of the player base was handed it as well .
---
There is no evidence of this, it's just fear mongering.
---
I've never played on an RP server, but I've always admired the passion you guys have. Seen it for years. So I upvote all of your posts for visibility.
---
Did you stop playinh wow because any bad launch experience? Do you know about anyone who has leave Wow because of this? I know the answer, "no".  So... why to break the classic experience? Why to put the last 3 years of effort in risk just for a thing that has never been?
---
Mana totem? For the innervate bot? Surely you jest.
---
A+
---
Maybe if we’re talking Chrommagus with his 10+ minutes of dispelling. Moonkins are pretty bad even with dependable gear but stop this mantra of Vanilla Raids being so difficult that every single person has to be pushing meters, its false.
---
Interesting video about this: https://youtu.be/D9YNAXZSgsA
---
Didn't Smashmouth do this first?
---
Hopefully there will be some slaves from world 3rd country (like Ukraine) on my EU server so I can get tons of ultra cheap gold and skipp boring grind for infinite pvp consumables and epic mount.
---
People who enjoy repeat same things over and over (aka grind) can be happy to do that as much as they want. But not for me.
---
haven't heard of them changing anything regarding spirit healers so anything like this should work the same way
---
Your ability to rank up is going to be a combination of how much you play and what premades will take you. You could quite easily hit rank 14 on a mage with 0 talents spent if you could play an unlimited amount and the top premade still took you.  
---
Similarly, in PvE there's never a fight where PvP dps specs wouldn't have dps to kill something. So there's never a ceiling or cutoff where you need to respec to PvE. If simply comes down to you and your guilds expectations.
---
they gotta nerf dem OP level 1 strats
---
Undercity was my chill spot. Forsaken for life!
---
I mean if people keep running up the ramp and pulling Greenskin with 10 adds, chances are I’m out. The only one who has any business running up that ramp is the tank, to pull mobs down. If people don’t understand that after two or three wipes I’ll probably peace out.
---
Alt-tabbing and following "under the radar" leveling guide.
---
yes it was made for people who want to play vanilla. not vanilla with sharding/ layering.   
---
you want convenience and dead shards retail is for you.
---
I always go in raw
---
No, you're saying that. Your reading comprehension is probably lacking but nowhere in my sentence did I say that.
---
Why is this a concern for you?
---
Look, I plan to get into a raid group as something OTHER than a healing shammy, and by the elements, I will do so; though mana totem/whirlwind totem, and being a flask slut.
---
I support the concept of layering. However, I do NOT support the current iteration of it - what Blizzard creates is a type of one huge mega-realm with tens of thousands of players in it, where world is ~~sharded~~ layered so that they don't see each other and can actually complete quests, but can freely change layers just by being invited by person on another layer, or being moved between layers without consent because the new layer is being created and it obviously can't contain only 1 player. 
---
There should be hard barriers between layers. Players should consider different layers as different realms for all purposes, where your character is attached to specific layer on creation and cannot move to other layers, and the only moment layers interact with each other is when they are merged - which is one way process that happens at the moment the population of both layers drops below a specific treshold. 
---
Most importantly though, I feel the need to explain what layers (in their current iteration) actually fix, and what they don't. I see a lot of people on this forum defending layering as a fix to issues they don't actually fix, and generally confusing their general purpose. To list some of them:
---
1) "With layers I won't have to fight for mobs at launch day". False. Each layer houses same population as original Vanilla realm. Without layering, they would still house the same population. Regardless of layering, you will still compete for resources with exactly the same amount of players. 
---
2) "With layers I can invite my friend to my group, with different realms I wouldn't be able to". False. That completely depends on what realm your friend will actually play. Regardless of layering, you will still be able to only invite those who chose to play on your realm. 
---
3) "With layers there won't be queues. My friends will always be able to roll on my server, while in the past there were full servers". False. False. False. People somehow expect realms of infinite size. There won't be infinite number of layers on each realm. We don't know exact number, but we can certainly expect less than 10. There will be still a popuation cap, and when all layers on a realm are filled there WILL be a queue to that realm. 
---
Remember people. The ONLY reason layering exists is to deal with INITIAL POPULATION SURGE. Blizzard knows there will be enormous amount of people at the early days, but majority of them will quit after few weeks at best. If they forced normal server population caps, realms would be dead after few weeks andthey would have to merge. If they expanded the caps for the launch ,game would be literally unplayable. They don't want to merge, so they invented layering. It DOESN'T fix ANYTHING else. If you think its some QoL feature that fixes Vanilla you just misunderstand what it is.
---
Without layering and with normal population caps, no difference would be seen until after these first few weeks.
---
I'll use some addon to see at least the available quests on minimap and maybe a leveling guide on second monitor.
---
Warlocks summoning is a benefit to help the group when you need to get people there faster - no argument against that. 
---
It’s a different scenario when someone asks to be summoned while they continue to quest, making no effort to run over when the rest of the group does - that is entitled. 
---
This would be the equivalent of a wipe happening in a dungeon and some people refuse to release and run back, but want the healer to make the sacrifice and do it because of their ability (this is not including the healer who is rezzed from a soul stone and can resurrect the entire party)
---
Right...which means people who have that mod will be using those words, which means.......he will be seeing twitch lingo.   Which he doesn’t want to see.   Is that confusing for you?
---
There is no sharding, but sure, scream enough, and your stupidity will break through.
---
Oh wait, it won’t. We’ll have layering and everything will be good. Convenience won.
---
&gt; layering wasn't needed 15 years ago
---
1.) The technology didn't exist 15 years ago.
---
2.) Vanilla WoW only launched to 100,000 players, WoW Classic could launch to over a million.
---
3.) Vanilla WoW is not the poster child of a stable launch, it was still fraught with problems and growing pains as it ballooned to millions of players.
---
4.) Vanilla WoW (and BC) had the benefit of a continuously growing playerbase that meant that server populations were always on the healthy side. Once player numbers started to drop in Cataclysm there was a lot of dead realms that needed to be merged. It's anyone's guess if Vanilla WoW will take off or will just be swarmed by tourists, so layering is airing on the side of caution to prevent dozens of dead realms 2 months after launch. You only need to look at Wildstar's server population problems shortly after their launch to see this in action, or just about any MMORPG that tried to compete with WoW.
---
Yeah and that will probably be completely different in 2019 since we have the authenticator. If you got your account hacked in 2005 you were pretty stupid, if you get your account hacked in 2019 you're a complete moron.
---
Gold farmers will have to go about their gold farming in legitimate ways.
---
If black wing lair is the raid you are supposed to progress after MC it was hard. And I remember it was considered to be hardcore material back in the day. 
---
The guild I was in was ofc not top notch. But we played consistently together for about 2 years. And our raid leader was actually a hardcore player that got tossed from a hardcore guild probably to anger issues.
---
Still not a single argument for it other than "wahhh i like it so it should be that way". Go with the flow, inept proverbial monkey typing out some cliche ad hominem instead of debated the subject at hand. Loser.
---
Very true! There's lots of bows and guns that exist around the 1.7 to 2.6 speed range. I guess it was an oversight on Blizzard's end the fact that they didn't realize that the Hunter DPS rotation heavily favors weapons with 3.0 speed or slower.
---
I'm not super familiar with all the technicalities of layering so forgive me if this opinion is too uninformed.
---
Layering should exist in areas 1-25 while leveling. Afterwards I think layering should stop and all players appear to each other/share mobs.
---
This will allow new players to experience the early game without hordes of players fighting them for mobs and stop so that we have a better community at higher levels.
---
Questie adds icons on map, really useful. Going to use that even though I intend to lvl in dungeons.
---
Joana's lvling guide is ofc really useful for people that haven't quested in vanilla and want a "guided tour".
---
by an insignificant margin*
---
In a raiding environment, warlocks go through mana twice as fast as mages and don't have an ability for mana regeneration while casting like mages do. Considering that using life tap is a huge DPS loss, the warlocks that will stand out are the ones using mana pots and demonic runes on cooldown. Sure you can just lifetap instead but you'll only be an average warlock. Also note that even with consumes you will still need to lifetap on most fights.
---
Note that I tested PreBiS gear stats to verify. A mage in prebis gear with 30/0/21 spec will have 4800-4900 mana unbuffed. Max rank frostbolt, with talents, costs 224 mana / 2.5 sec per cast = 93.6 mana per second while chain casting. 4870 mana / 93.6 mana per second = 52 seconds of chain casting (not including the ~50+ mana per 5 you get from mage armor + talents) or 20 frostbolts before going oom or needing to consume.
---
Meanwhile, a preBiS geared warlock will have roughly 3913 mana unbuffed. Max rank shadowbolt costs 366 mana (with 0/31/20 spec) divided by 2.5 seconds per cast, comes to 146 mana per second while casting. 3913 mana / 146 mana per second = 26 seconds of casting or 10.7 shadowbolts before going oom or needing to lifetap/consume.
---
Therefore warlocks have less than half the mana efficiency of mages. Warlocks shine best on shorter fights where they can mana pot/demonic rune and not go oom before needing to lifetap. In endgame gear and consumes where lifetap is restoring 1k-2k mana that will change things a bit
---
Please bring these back. Commenting for traction
---
Oh man, I totally forgot about Warhammer Online! The way they integrated world bosses and PvP into the natural zone progression while leveling was an awesome idea.
---
Also bought gold and will do so agian I love the game but go in with mindset not too but soon as I see majority of people ahead of me be cuase of time I'm buying gold, if people want me to not buy gold then put a time limit of how much everybody can play a day forget all the haters I play how I want what gives me Fun so if they play 14 hours a day and fun I play 4 and buy gold to each he's own I accept all the risks  plus I got money can always start new account
---
Bone slicing hatchets are a dungeon drop...
---
I had a friend who would afk eating dinner with someone on follow for a boss or 2 during Raid times. This was normal in vanilla
---
You must not have leveled past 20, because the GCD is nowhere near as bad as it's criticized when you actually have your class abilities.
---
You could say the same about all the rest as well. Technically, yes you can tank these when some of the mobs are orange and the end boss is red to you. But you're really not gaining anything from doing that except stroking your own ego (ie which explains why it's such a common suggestion here in a reddit thread). It *sounds* good, but all you're doing is making the run slower and more annoying for the entire group. Come back in 2 levels and now the run is much smoother and faster, the healer never runs oom and you can pull multiple packs at once, and you're not constantly fighting for aggro with another high level dps in the group.
---
Use VanillaGuide addon
---
Yeah it's truly a deleterious change. I've managed to get the numbers back just a little bit through addon usage, but it's still not like the old:
---

---
It's still the number one killer on live mate. Dazed is the bane of everyone, but they added mount equipment so you can't be dazed so it won't be for long.
---
&gt;Would rank 10 be attainable with a consistent premade group?
---
Very easily if we're talking 20 hours in the BG era (P3) with a consistent premade that's decent
---
&gt;What about solo queening?
---
If you run into a lot of premades while soloqing it might take you a lot of time going from rank 8 to rank 10, but I'd wager it would still be possible, just potentially extended a few weeks depending on your luck.
---
Isn't Mocking Blow sorta shit?
---
kinda funny, im on the exact page RN
---
Few people attack the mage in the open world (excluding high level gankers ofc). 
---
You can blink away from any melee that opens on you and just kite them to death.
---
With casters, polymorph allows you to reset the fight easily. And the come back for revenge.
---
Hunters... hunters are the sole exception. Irritating as fuck. When hunter opens on you with sending pet while standing 40y away there is little you can do. While leveling, I don't think you can really defeat a hunter that attacks you first. Meanwhile ,even if you attack first its hard to win. You need to keep the pet polymorphed and stay in his melee/dead zone so he cant shoot. Then you can literally arcane explosion him to death, because hunters cant heal.
---
I'm actually looking forward to having to read the actual quest in order to know what to do and where to go, so no add-ons here
---
Warrior/Priest is a fantastic combo. Could even break up the gender stereotypes and have her tank while you heal!
---
That's not how it works LOL
---
10 is easy. I did rank 13 and had to play 14+ hrs a day. I didnt go for 14 because it was going to be another 3 weeks at 14 hours a day and i already had a drake talon cleaver. If youre only doing r10, i suggest friending up the people going for 14 and just play as much as you can. The more you play per week, the less weeks it takes to get to 10.
---
$1 bills? No, hundred dollar bills. 
---
I went all out for BFA, new computer, 34” Alienware monitor, Corsair peripherals.... all for a flop. So they’ve been chilling for a year until classic comes out
---
Because the person(s) not running back are not blankly staring at their screen. They are doing other things while the group is getting back together. 
---
It’s the principle of being selfless in the group.
---
If someone's experience is ruined by being ganked then that's "toxic" according to what you said.
---
I think rank 10 is what people say is obtainable with ~20 hours weekly, premade gets much much faster honor than solo queue.
---
I got rank 10 in vanilla while in school, raided, played multiple characters (I had 6 lvl 60 characters) and didn't know the exact details about the pvp system.
---
No idea how much I pvped to reach it, but I did a fair bit of premade pvp.
---
I think you need to be among the top ~300-500 players (on your faction) for honor gain per week to get rank 10.
---
The normal meal prep for the week and have plenty of snacks and drinks as well. I may get a new cushion for my seat (like that egg sitter you see on tv) because my computer chair has no cushion left, I am just sitting on the bare metal at this point.
---
Nothing. I've been saving money so I can buy gold for my epic mount and raid consumables.
---
I've played Wow since vanilla for 12 years, and i would prefer by a large margin to spend a couple of days waiting 20 minute everytime i log in than see people disapearing in front of me, jumping from layer to layer to farm mats, etc etc. I promise.
---
And 1 point that maybe seems irrelevant, but i think is the key. This is not a 2019 game, is a 2004 game, and is the game we have been waiting for sooo long. With its problems included. That's why we all are here now.
---
I'll be starting off herb/skinning and dropping skinning for enchanting at 40, to get a head start leveling my enchanting. Not sure if it's worth it to gather skins after I get my mount?

I don't really know who is and isn't a streamer, but the semi-finals/finals were pretty much all the same people as last tournament. I don't know how they picked invitees, but all the most prominent pvpers on alliance were missing. So it looked that way to me.
---
Why do you even type that useless shit that has not a single idea behind
---
How are you trying to say how it does and doesn't work...you literally asked how it worked like 4 comments ago...unbelievable
---
I believe we absolutely need the service that layering is going to provide at the launch of the game (launch being first month).
---
I don't think the current iteration of layering is great, but I don't think it's game breaking terrible either.
---
At the end of the day, layering is going to fade it such distant memory that we will hardly remember its effect in 2 years time. I equate it how original world pvp was when hk's were implemented pre-battle grounds. Some people remember it exactly and everyone else sorta remembers it as thing that wasn't around too long and was phased out so not a big deal
---
&gt;  i would prefer by a large margin to spend a couple of days waiting 20 minute everytime 
---
I’m sure you would, too bad that isn’t even in the same realm of reality of problems that launch will have. It won’t be a 20 minute wait, it’ll be a week long wait before the servers are stable enough. People will be 60 before some people can’t even play.
---
I’m sure if you downplay the reality of the situation enough then sure, layering sounds worse.
---
Honestly, engineering isn't as bad once you get it leveled up. From a consumable standpoint you'll spend way more money on potions than on grenades. Each heavy stone you mine is 2-4 grenades, making them crazy cheap to make. Go farm for an hour and you have enough nades to last you several hours. Or you can just farm gold and buy them for cheap off someone.
---
Fucking awesome comment :) gold trading will be a thing and people are going to throw a fit!
---
I’ve gotten down to 5 1/2, but any less than that and I actually feel like trash all day. I wish I could make it to 4.
---
Them nightsabers 2 sexy good
---
There will always be a market for some skins, devilsaur in particular. I'm doing herb/skinning as well, I still haven't decided on my endgame professions
---
Yup, be prepared to miss a lot of quests if you don't have quest starts on. Unless you've memorised every wanted poster, basement and attic in the game you will walk past many quests.
---
Awesome, glad to hear that
---
Bwahahaha 🤣
---
It’s significantly easier on smaller servers, right?
---
Last I checked this wasn't a subreddit for Street Fighter, sharing hobbies with your SO, or r/relationship_advice.
---
I think it depends on focus. The vast majority of people who are focusing on pvp will have it this time around.
---
I was a raiding Rogue in Vanilla, and Engineering was very helpful. It gave me an AoE ability for fights that needed it. Vanish + Jumper Cables could save a raid from running back. Repair bot was also helpful. I remember some good goggles that held me over for a while. And that's just what stuck with me 15 years later, there's probably more benefits I've forgotten. 
---
It was expensive (even with mining my own ores), but worth it.
---
Vanilla killed the game? Really? i thouth that vanilla player base grew and grew and grew, like with TBC... 
---
The point that player base started to decrese was when things like this started were asked for.
---
Just compare Vanilla/TBC/TLK player base with today's "wow"...
---
but thats why we have addons, to be different than normal wow!
---
Most OP skill NA
---
Keep in mind phase 3 is going to look a lot different than launch, playerbase wise.
---
So it all depends on if you are going on a PvE or pvp server since you'll be able to world pvp and start ranking in phase 2.
---
Rank 10 will be pretty easy to get as long as you are working for it.
---
Yeah that's brutal. Good luck!
---
Lets see...
---
* Can't manually install AddOns (Mods.) without first party support
---
* Would likely require both traditional and simplified controller UI, No console game is exclusively MKB.
---
* Probably gonna pay that 'Multiplayer' tax to Sony or MS
---
* Probably gonna have to pay for that sub to play classic or BfA on top of that.
---
* Someone gets the console banned off MS or Sony's network? Too bad.
---
* Going to need a PC, laptop, or a phone to keep those wowhead guides up at all times.
---
* Probably won't have an uncapped framerate.
---
* Stuck on HDMI, no glorious 144hz or 240hz gaming monitors over displayport.
---
mechanical keyboard (mx red) and new mice.
---
Also new chair
---
Queue times are a non issue because blizzard said they are using the cross realm system for Bgs.
---
I still have over 40 snowballs in my bank.
---
If your guild doesn't care about PvP, and you're on a PvE server, the ret paladin, or the undergeared Hunter you just recruited gets the Ashkandi. That's the "Pure PvE" meta. There is no raid reason, at all, for a warrior to have an Ashkandi. xD
---
One of my favorite episodes of Parks &amp; Rec
---
hahaha improved renew xD
---
nice troll
---
looks the same but if it's different then plz fix
---
The cave one is also largely a waste of time, but the one I'm talking about is north of razor hill, west of the road in the ravine
---
No, because that's multiple patches and an entire expansion ahead of the original WoW. It's possible that they were using an addon, or that there were changes made during BC to the combat text.
---
I would like to see a side-by-side comparison of Vanilla to Classic. It's idiotic to point towards something in BC and say "oh yes, look at how great it was in Classic!" because it's not classic, it's a different expansion. 
---
I like the combat text in the first gif more, like you guys. I'm not arguing that it's not better, I'm just saying it's absolutely silly to point at it as an example because it's not classic text.
---
Did you actually read what he wrote? He's arguing for layering as a temporary measure,  against the guy who wants to wait in those ques.
---
There’s this thing called “ignore list”
---
&gt; you might have to take a step back and reconsider your choices in life.
---
&gt; I'm not judging anyone
---
Lol
---
On one hand, I hate that we've been waiting for the game to come back to how it was, for a decade now, and we get the launch morphed into something so foreign to what WoW used to be.
---
On the other, I get that a solution is helpful. But I think sharding (or re-purposed layering) for 1-20 zones is infinitely better than layering. Layering the entire 1-60 is such an extreme solution to a targeted problem.
---
In the end, I dont care about layering much, IF it lasts two weeks. But I don't think it will, I think it will last 2-3 months, until Phase two comes out, like Blizzard has suggested could happen.
---
They're less likely to be an issue, but we have no idea how big the battlegroups are going to be, or how faction balance is going to be. As well as a whole bunch of different variables.
---
Claiming something won't be an issue, (however unlikely) when you **don't know** is bad practise.
---
The more people like that that get flushed out of the system the better.
---
It’s difficult to give you an answer on this, due to the way honor works. If you are consistently putting in your 20+ hours, I would guess that you’ll be fine to get rank 10. Basically it comes down to how many people are participating (getting any honor that week) and among those how well did you do.
---
I remember playing an arcane mage and single handedly stealing towers in AV.   The horde would try to defend them, and I would just snowball them off.  I also had the talent so that when my mana shield popped, it would do a knockback.   I just kept knocking them off the towers.   There was no way for them to get them.
---
Well said, and i agree. J Allen Brack himself said Classic is going to be fine even if say just the core audience ended up playing the game. 
---
It's supposed to be a preservation of the original game, nothing more, nothing less. If they truly wish to provide the accurate experience, start to finish, they gotta do away with layering and let the MMORPG experience (which launch is a part of!) unfold, good and bad included.
---
And they're choosing their faction based on your mage choice?
---
I dont really think it will decline as much as you think.
---
The players that are going to return to wow because of classic wow will stay.  The new wow players will of course stay because is much better than BFA. And BFA players will taste vanilla and... will stay too. :D
---
You can always face your back away from mobs, regardless of the distance they can attack you from...
---
do you really not know what the threat ceiling is?
---
And didn't have EVERYONE playing on day 1. 
---
Get over it.
---
They aren't constant, so it's absolutely relevant.
---
That’s not Magtheridon.
---
survivor bias.  You know no one who quit at launch because they quit.
---
&gt;and thats from when they game was actually popular.
---
You're cute. Vanilla launch had servers down for **days**, and the playerbase was measured in the **thousands** day/week 1. This time around it's going to be measured in the **millions**. If you **actually** believe it's going to be **better** with **many more players** and **less servers**, I can completely understand why you think no layering would be better.
---
i like how people put the year as there argument.  
---
buddy its 2019 stop ruining video games for other people because you're an impatient bag of shit.

STRAW POLL: [HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT LAYERING TO LAST?](https://strawpoll.com/hpy8hr7w)
---
I just have to ask: How many people reading this think layering will last 2 weeks? I want to know what the community at large thinks, and straw poll posts are banned on r/classicwow. I'm open to any discussion on this.
---
Ive leveled to 60 enough times, i’ll have addons
---
Yeah, sharding 1-20 is such a better plan. Thats where the real bottleneck is, and layering is a blunt force solution to a delicate problem.
---
Look up modcraft.
---
Excel shouldn’t churn too hard on any wow related spreadsheet unless the references were insane. There can’t be more than a few thousand pieces of gear.
---
Only redeemable thing about transmog was being able to transmog cloth chest that wasn’t a robe so you could have a full sized tabard.
---
Well i can't remember vanilla lauch that clearly, but possibly TBC was not better (more players at that time), and i dont rememeber these queues you are talking about!! The opening of the dark portal was... well, IS the most epic moment of all Wow story!! :D :D :D
---
This gives me nightmare flashbacks of Anub'rekan attempts in vanilla as main tank. Hunter assisted perimeter runs around the swarms. One of the rare times you needed aspect.
---
What book is this?
---
Hi, /u/Gehga
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9ywk1/this_piece_of_garbage_they_call_classic_wow/). 
---
There is a very distinct difference. A free transfer is a choice that every single player on that realm will have to make, a choice. Server merges are forced and affect everyone, you can't opt out of a merger.
---
&gt;It takes 6 to 9 hours per week to raid if you are not hardcore.
---
And it takes many more to actually be "raid ready" with consumables and such.
---
Like yeah you can fumble around a bit and the content is easy enough to where you don't have to min max in order to clear raids. But Vanilla is the grindiest version of WoW. You are far more rewarded for your time investment then actually being "good" at the game.
---
no, it's not an Elite mob, it's a fucking nightmare den with 2-3 mobs all aggroing at once, if you are lucky
---
lmao bet they were PISSED
---
I'm gonna have to look it up then because I cant for the life of me remember and I just did all the durotar quests less than a month ago &gt;_&lt;
---
The biggest giveaway that you are playing Vanilla is that you remember mob spawn locations and camp spawns 1 by 1 in a circle to complete a quest that needs 10 of 1 item with a 10-20% drop rate.
---
Hahaha. They should have tell us via forums or something :P
---
Spoken like a true trump supporter...... If u reply one more time I'll let u know the name....trash not. :)
---
No thanks, I only have a few hours to game, and I don't want to sit in a queue for hours when I could be playing.
---
But it has in TBC, and was perfect. Most remembered moment in wow.
---
I'm pretty sure Blizzard won't listen to people who get upset after 1-3 gankings. There is probably not a magic number but safe to say that if you're being corpse camped for hours or across multiple sessions it has definitely crossed the line.
---
You see the easy solution to this right
---
I'm not talking about queues, I'm talking about the complete inability to login. 20 minute queues, if that's all their really were, would 100% be acceptable. The reality is, however, servers would just flat-out be unplayable if you trying to shove millions of players on a handful of servers without sharding/layering.
---
The wow diary
---
Because it's not vanilla. It's classic. Same reason we have right click report, battle net integration, and more.
---
Fucking amen!
---
Link the add-on, lots of people want it(shame it doesn't exist).
---
Fun fact, in Classic daze is only 50%. Nowadays in Retail its 75%. It still can't be removed by things that remove slows aswell
---
Well those two things didn't exist at the same time, sorry to ruin your memory
---
There's no way that many players stay. I'm basing this off every private servers initial vs two-three month population drop.
---
We need this, at least a hero with a mod to do it
---
Unless it's a druid, then it's die, rez and move to another zone.
---
Playing on PS does not make you some expert on classic wow. Get over yourself.
---
This is going to be the P99 crowd coming to EQ TLPs all over again. Just as obnoxious and pretentious as it was 10 years ago.
---
Yet the Molten Core was an amazing raid. It being so gigantic in scale had an epic feel to it.
---
jesus how butthurt can someone be
---
The difference between a class lead and someone who is really good at their class almost always comes down to their demeanor:
---
Can you defuse a situation that is escalating?
---
Do your fellow class players respect you and listen to you?
---
Are you patient and a good communicator?
---
Do you accurately represent the values of the guild?
---
All that stuff is extremely important.
---
We really do need RP-PVP servers. :(
---
I wish I could've posted the paragraph on the next page, about people praising the goofy red gas
---
If you wanna do damage in dungeons/soloing you use cat form, you ignore spell damage talents and spec into +10% melee damage and omen of clarity
---
There's other variables there too. Not only is prime time not constant but even if it was we don't know when OP has their window of opportunity.
---
We also know that non prime time has potentially less competition from the top premades, so it's also a variable that worse queue times can actually be more efficient for the group you have *if* you're averaging less losses and faster matches per hour.
---
Xrealm does indeed reduce a lot of these variables but even then we also don't know how big battlegroups are going to be yet and we also don't know what faction balance is going to be like across said battlegroups. All in all, even though there's **probably** nothing to worry about, we just don't know. We can't know. Not until it's happening.
---
HAHAHA ah man... you knew an Annie too, huh? Love me some guild drama
---
Yea you are probably right there. Internet and min maxing was kinda a newish thing back then. I did not even had a phone I could browse the webs on back then.
---
So how do you suggest we combat inflation? Repairs is the biggest source of gold exiting the economy.
---
No leveling add-on that'd help too much for the first leveling. I like to enjoy the original experience. And no, just because Vanilla had add-ons doesn't mean shit. The game is designed without some features? Then that's the game. Later on for other chars I can deviate from the idea but first run will be a bliss.
---
Nothing yet, for the things I want to buy I need the game to launch. I'll probably buy a subscription for a leveling addon, it's just more convenient this way for me, I know most people have mixed opinions about this, but I don't mind the extra sub.  I'll have a list of addons I'll use and probably donate some of the creators for their work.
---
That’s toontown you’re thinking of
---
\+1
---
Bought a new PC last month after having the same one for 7 years just for classic :)
---
Theres other factors too, though. Most people who play on a fresh private server are probably aware of it's existence. Not as many people will "discover" it through word of mouth, or even through something like streamer hype. A legitimately offered Classic product will have a greater potential for drawing in new customers, I believe. 
---
Also, for example, one popular server that I played launched at around 9k, inflated to 11k, and then, three months later, it was still at a constant 7-10k population. Even just recently, it was "celebrating" 12k populations.
---
get in line, mate
---
The plan is to go down the list of players, and /roll for each to generate the bracket. Brackets will be filled top to bottom highest to lowest roll. I will do this on stream though good point.
---
Depends how efficient you wanna be - The druid ideally want's to stay in Teldrassil for bear form, but once they hit level (12?) they get access to Teleport Moonglade, which can be a semi-quick way of getting back to Darnassus for class quests.
---
The most efficient way for both of you would probably be (imo)
---
NE: Teldrassil&gt;Darkshore&gt;Loch Modan&gt; Meet up in either Westfall or Ashenvale.
---
Human: Elwynn Forest, Loch Modan&gt; Darkshore &gt; Meet up in Westfall or Ashenvale.
---
Westfall might (?) be better to help with the druid getting his aquatic form as he needs to go there for part of the chain and could use the FP/Hearthstone
---
Ofcourse the human could make the run to Teldrassil from the start or vice versa, or you could meet up in Darkshore after doing Elwynn - It all depends on which zones you find fun.
---
Thanks for posting this! Loved the read.
---
Kinda different when it is against the rules or totally allowed, some people spend thousands of dollars on mobile games, idk if they would drop money like that on classic wow.
---
I have not tested it but I don't know how abbon sees stop casts and so on. I will try during the stress test.
---
I agree that 1-20 would be better if it’s technically feasible to get done in the next month or so and test but is it? Only they know.
---
2 gathering professions isn't recommended because you'll be running to a bank/mailbox to empty your bags too often.
---
I’d be cool if you linked the item so us semi-casuals could nerd out on some classic gear and familiarize!
---
I've seen some interesting theorycrafting for boomkins using downranked Starfire. This combined with chain chugging mana pots and demonic runes could allow a boomkin to actually last for a whole fight. Granted, the dps would still be absolute shit and it would be SUPER expensive and/or time consuming BUT it is theoretically possible to have mana for a whole fight.
---
Some of the better and more interesting specs for balance druid raiding are some of the PvP specs that dont actually spec deep enough for boomkin BUT have WAY more utility. Yeah, you may still have to heal at times but you'll be able to do comparable boomkin dps when you dont. Something to consider
---
This, essentially. I was 16 when I played at first, now I am 30. I want to be playing with other folks my age with whom I can raid and make friends. Community first, progression second but still high on the list.
---
I think layering is the best tool for a tough situation. Everyone's going to want to play on well-populated realms (for the most part), but if they're overcrowded, farming materials and completing quests would probably be discouraging in really high traffic areas. Layering allows people to be together on the same realm.
---
Right now, they don't know the maximum number of people they are going to have playing or what a stable population will look like. I believe they are going to have a SMALL set of servers of each type, and stick everyone into layers on those realms. Once the tourists leave, if there are too many people on certain servers/layers, then they'll open up new Realms from the overcrowded servers, offering people chances to transfer to the new servers, and encouraging new players to start playing on the new realms.
---
I believe them when they say that layering will be gone by phase 2, but hope it will be sooner.
---
Most people had a lot more free time back then. I’m sure many did quit though.
---
Druids have a solid one, it's a little worse for overall than fully specing pvp
---
Then you’re misremembering. Even then, nothing has such an absurd aggro range.
---
I'm 100% for layering. The only change I would make is to make it even harder to switch layers without the aid of another player.
---
The alternatives are either having quests be nearly impossible because of too many players. Or, lowering the cap of players on the server and having enormous queues. I want to have the servers with higher capacity than old vanilla, but I also want to have fun at launch. That means layering.
---
The only real downside is that no matter what safeguards they try to put in place someone might find a way to exploit layering and unbalance the economy. But if they do that Blizzard can already ban them. Working on modern wow architecture means everything is getting logged and some algorithm is checking those logs looking for bad people to ban.
---
Yes but its an important detail when talking about BiS that might take a hundred attempts to farm.
---
Blizzard, change it!
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21134/dark-edge-of-insanity
---
I'm against private server (PS) players constantly talking down to others about layering like it's the end of the world.
---
As someone who has actually played what Blizzard is about to implement, I can tell you that attrition will kill most servers and Blizzard is preparing for that. A large mega-server will work better for progression and attrition long term than multiple little servers then combining them later. And I mean really, how is that any different than layering except that it isn't called layering?
---
The nochanges crowd is just a bunch of PS players wanting things the way they are used to which Blizzard has already proven time and time again was incorrect. Layering will prove to be successful and you won't hear a peep from players when it is, per usual.
---
It was a very long time ago but there is videos and other people as well my man sorry this was not ment to start a argument sorry about it.
---
I assume you can carry them over to WoW: Classic: BC when the blizz greed levels hit 100
---
I found out my old css clan had started up on wow as the opposite faction, one member was a bit of a bully and an all round dick so the other guys would give me his location for a weekly corpsecamp
---
No one ever told him the Craic so the guy spent months wondering why this level ?? Night elf rogue would corpsecamp him, how I kept finding him, or why i never turned on the rest of the party
---
And the president of Blizzard changed his mind. What a novel concept.
---
This is incredible. I don’t comment much, but this deserves attention. The difference is wild.
---
This thread mostly seems pointless, from what ive seen browsing through the comments its already mostly just the same argueing over whether its good or bad thats been in countless other posts already. I really doubt we will get anything new or helpful from this.
---
Thankfully legalization in the US has flooded into the illegal market in other states. I go to a dealer now and he has boxes and boxes of stuff shipped from legal states all in original packaging.
---
Sure but it does more than I want. Was just curious whether there is an alternative that just shows where quests are on the minimap but nothing more.
---
I loved TBC and Wrath, but I feel like if they go with re-releasing expansions we'll just hit a dead end.  If they release different Classic+ expansions based on Vanilla, we might end up with a lot more great content in the long run.
---
Don't forget the fast spawning thunderlizards you have to fight through in the ravine to reach him.  Even as a long time veteran I have skipped this quest on many occasions due to the frustration.
---
hey guys thanks for the insight but i may have not ellaborate enough, i want to try PVE Priest as Holy or Retri (whichever is best) but i also like pvp a lot, thats why i was talking about respecing as priest
---
I miss Ravenholdt, what a great server. Idk why but RP PVP always had such nice world pvp, like organized events between prominent guilds on the factions that would set up a battle for Caer Darrow or soemthing
---
Your right :) Doesn't mean it won't be aids, with serious rankers avoiding any sort of PvP where they can lose (time), and only PvPing when the opponent has no chance of winning.
---
First off, I don't mind layering *too much* if it lasts 2 weeks. If it goes past that, I have a problem with it. 
---
And when it does, I think it will destroy the server community during the growth period of the server. Think about it, 2 months is 80% of Classic fans' level 1-60 experience. 
---
I wish we could go back to the days of Blizzard saying they'd shard the starting zones. Hell, 1-20, even 1-30 is drastically better than layering the *entire* leveling process.
---
Someon will farm the BiS. Someone will be content with BSH.
---
The dilemma here is if Blizzard removes layering then the first few months of the game will be virtually unplayable due to the sheer population on the servers forcing Blizzard to make more servers which is not a good thing. The problem is after the first few months when the population dies down if there are too many servers the player base will be too spread to thin. The best solution in my opinion would be to limit layering to certain zones, allowing Blizzard to have fewer servers with denser populations.  
---
Just limit layering to low level zones like 1-20 or 30 so players can't take advantage of layering for end-game gathering and world PvP. The majority of players on vanilla private servers are between levels 1-40 and then the population dips from 41-59 due to the grind and then grows again at 60 with the level cap. So it is safe to assume a similar trend will exist in the Classic servers.  
---
If you limited layering to these zones you will prevent an overflow of players questing and prevent it's abuse in later level zones i.e. farming Black Lotus herbs and avoiding players in world pvp.

I'm just happy they are bringing back combat text for combat state.
---
Go play retail.
---
thats what i have been told..
---
So... Did you win the lottery?
---
The server size is increased a lot vs old vanilla sizes, 6-7x. I never played on a pserver to know how it compares to that. Layering exists because people were so adamant about not having dynamic spawning for mobs. But they also don't want sharding. And they also don't want to wait in queues. And they also want to be able to at least have a chance at completing low level quests.
---
Layers are also the same size as old vanilla servers used to be, so you will have just as many people in the zones competing for things and making it difficult. The only difference is you may have to group with your friend to see them (which it would be dumb not to since there aren't any shared tags or anything). If you played on server 15 in the last stress test you would have seen what an at capacity layer will look like on release.
---
The whole idea is that in 2-4 weeks when the tourists are gone or people have spread out there are no more extra layers and instead it's one world with a population much larger than Vanilla WoW had.
---
That's the base strategy yes. Any good hunter however is prepared to protect their dead zone using Eng and potions. When you die horribly to a hunter as a mage, you'll know which type of hunter you are facing.
---
more like the caves in Teldrassil
---
They just put out a new album. They still make good music.
---
The thunder lizards are not that bad. Also, on Classic they will not spawn that fast.
---
there's a cave in Teldrassil that's similar
---
I’d agree that blizzard has been out of touch but that’s a little different than what I was saying. What I mean is I don’t know how much harder/ more man hours it would take to change the servers for it to work from 1-20. Personally I don’t want to wait another 6 months for them to implement that technology. I have no idea how long it would take but I suppose that’s the balance. If it could be easily done quickly I’m for it, but I doubt it is.
---
We should restrict layering to the bottom half of the cake. That way the top part of the cake won't be full of black lotuses.
---
Yeah? To me it's the other way it seems. Playing a female NE feels so much better than playing any other race it's gotten to the point where I'm more likely to become an emigrant but play the race that resonates with me the most.
---
I actually made a few orcs and undead for the classes I haven't played but am interested in, but after having tried NE everything pales in comparison: uglier models, funky movement, bland animations (female undead rogue is an exception). 
---
It sucks, cause as you say, everything else Alliance feels foreign. I don't know the main characters, I have barely seen their zones, it's kinda boring to have humans, fat humans and short humans for allies, and fighting against the Horde seems wrong. The Alliance don't have Thrall, nor Sylvanas, nor Rexxar. They don't have the Barrens(chat), no majestic Tauren, emblematic Orcs, mysterious Trolls or fearsome Undead. All of them are my brethren, it's just that I don't feel like being any of these races. Shit, I feel like I'm unconvincing myself now and tilting more towards Horde now haha.
---
First one feels like the rogue videos I used to watch and aspire to in pvp. Second one feels like a self scrolling kindle. Hope they fix it.
---
I am generally a pve server guy. I want and do pvp but I generally can’t stand to be attacked when I am not prepared. 
---
But yes time around I feel it does not matter to much per se. I have played it all before. It will just be a repeat. 
---
So to make it more dimensional I think I will go for a pvp server and hopefully don’t care to much about being ganked since taking long to level means less than what it used to do for me.
---
Well technically they are the WoD models and also you’re wrong.
---
Made the diving helmet from engineering and explored the bottom of the ocean for no reason. Was a good time.
---
Casual is a cop out term, if you ask me.  You could just log in and get summoned to a raid, zero consumables, zero world buffs, and you could still do better than people who play 14 hours a day but put zero effort into learning their rotations/class and are horrible at the game.  All you had to do is have a "hardcore" mindset, and actually put effort into your play, knowing your rotation, researching your BiS list, actually going out and using your time to obtain your BiS rather than just randomly doing dungeons hoping you get some loot and wearing whatever you *think* is best, knowing the boss fights, not dying 10 seconds into a fight because you pulled aggro with your l33t DPS.
---
Casual/hardcore is just a midnset, not an indicator of playtime.  I have a demanding career, a wife, and kids, I don't have time to play 12+ hours like I used to, so rather than brute forcing the game, I'm going to go about it much more efficiently and methodically this time around.  In my mind, it'll be more "hardcore" than I used to be, because I'm probably putting as much time into researching how to be more effective as I'll actually put into playing the game.
---
I always thought the layout was odd.l and the bosses seemed out of context...now I know why. They were right those, context and art are just window dressing after all.
---
It's a fix to waiting in a queue for 2-3 hours, or for a quest that should take 10 minutes taking 3 hours because there are 200 people trying to tag 15 mob spawns.
---
Also, rebrand implies nothing has changed, when layering is actually technically quite different. Maybe you should have read the wowhead article about layering before posting.
---
Check for yourself!
---
So you’re saying there’s a chance!
---
Holy shit dude. Take a look at your post history. Go outside for a few minutes, lay on the grass, close your eyes and just soak up some sun. Listen to the birds, the peace around you, and calm the fuck down already.
---
So you like your character looking all bouncy and overly happy like some Disney movie? The models are garbage dude. Burn BFA and everything that came with it.
---
Hey we have Innervate!...its on CD though because I needed mana.
---
We can't have the cake and eat it too
---
I remember making friends with 2 random people in a BFD run, we then went on to level together make alts and decide to 3 man every dungeon in the game (or at least the ones we could being that some require 5 for certain things) We then went on to be Multi-Glads in BC and Wrath as a 3 man team. This will hopefully return soon when classic comes back!
---
Man...I remember some fucking hunters griefing in BG's by just constantly leaving that shit on...you should be able to remove "friendly" auras.
---
And he's still attacking it
---
So our little discussion here actually inspired me to create a program for calculating your average DPS and how different stats would benefit you. I still have some work to do but expect to finish it within the next two days. Will post a link here when I am done with it.

I said 2 weeks, I'm fairly optimistic about it actually. I just don't see tourists lasting more than a week. Based on this historical data: 
---
https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/11/70-of-trial-players-quit-wow-before-level-10/
---
It would make sense that tourists wont make it past level 10. It only takes a few hours to hit level 10, so really how many days do you need to wait before the tourists quit? 2 weeks sounds more than enough to me.
---
This is actually a pretty big deal. Hopefully they change it before release.
---
The way I think it should work is this..
---
Have your server split into maybe 4 'layers' on release.  So Malygos would be Malygos 1-4, and by layers I actually mean separate realms maxing out at the original vanilla limits.  The "layers" would all share a single name pool and would collapse together as players spread apart and short term players leave and do the final merging before world bosses release, leaving server, probably with a higher pop than original wow but not as high as certain popular private projects.  Blizzard could give people a few invites to their layer, or make a special 'invite to layer' rock that has a day+ cooldown.

crossrealm bgs will ensure constant queus and smaller servers wont have it easier since queus will be popping regardless of server activity
---
Probably the only fight in Classic a hunter really gets to shine.
---
Btw: Anub'Rekhan encounter: so well designed. Have fond memories of it, despite morons in my raid spawning scarabs killing the raid in a chain reaction. Seeing our big ass Tauren MT and Tauren hunter kiting that big ass intimidating Crypt Lord felt amazing.
---
The problem is it's spammy as fuck now with all the stupid passive and proc damage, and the overall increase in APM. You used to be able to associate each number with its source in your head. Now it's just a bunch of random shit, most of which you don't control.
---
Combat used to be slower and chunkier. Now it's so smooth and burst window-oriented you can hardly tell you cast a Frostbolt on the enemy.
---
I've found a good middle ground is Nameplate Scrolling Combat Text. You can control the motions, size, and font of each text type, and can also color damage by school to make things a little more distinct in the spam.

Something like this kinda works if you really only want to have a single button.
---
    /cast [@pet,dead][mod:shift]Revive Pet; [nopet,nomod]Call Pet; [nomod]Dismiss Pet
---
If your pet is dead &amp; despawned you get an error, but you can then do shift + key to cast revive pet.
---
I used to play on a private server, one that was alive for about a decade. Since I was terribly well-geared, it was really cool to 'always' have my character there. Two years could pass by, no expansions would come, and I could jump into a battleground any time I wanted, fully geared.
---
The idea of having a character stuck at 60 isn't necessarily a bad thing.
---
I fucking hope not. Ruins a major part of the game, the economy.
---
Yes, gold sellers existed in Classic, they were not nearly as easy and completely risk free as tokens.
---
Man... Tier 2.5 was so horrible looking. But some of those drops from AQ were super busted.
---
This NEEDS to happen
---
How many raptors do I need to kill for silver coin quest? I’ve been here for 2 hours!
---
You know, now that you mention it maybe you're right. This was 15 years ago + for me I think. But I really thought I took this shot at Mag because I remember getting yelled at for being late to the first trash pull after lol
---
This is very very incorrect! There are mailboxes everywhere, you just need to have a bank alt posted up in a major city beside one.
---
Ahhh you're one of those kind of levelers. Well theres a place for everyone in Classic man. I'm guessing you don't like the grind of leveling and exploring?
---
but my questing experience /s
---
i agree entirely... i quit wow because it lost that 1 world and everyone was in it feeling.
---
That's a good point. It's troubling that blizzard would keep it vague when layering isn't really needed beyond the first 2-3 weeks. That being said, it wouldn't be totally terrible if a server was flooded with 1000 black lotus, heh.
---
Finish it with a Guzzler Helmet so you don't have to \*gasps\* *reach* for your drink, plus the drink containing all the nutrients the body needs so you cut down on eating time, and we have a deal.
---
Nor sellers
---
It's not fully able to be stopped, the people make their livelihood by selling gold for years know how to do it properly and not get caught. Lots of different IPs, HWIDs, and accounts that look (couple of 40s, etc) legitimate.
---
This really isn't something that affects the game or the economy of each realm, the gold is all farmed just like anyone else would do, I wouldn't personally worry about it.
---
I didn't like it at first. But the set has grown on me. I love that set now. Helm and all. I know it's no warrior t3, but I just love how strong the set is for pvp.
---
It should take you less than 3 minutes to read a page of text.
---
Modern prostitution
---
&gt;It's been proven that my opinion is correct.
---
No it hasn't. And each layer is the same size as a Vanilla server was, so you're still getting that same experience.
---
&gt;Layering causes consistent inflation and breaks immersion on a regular day to day basis.
---
On inflation... no it doesn't, because they are implementing more systems to keep people for exploiting it. If people do still manage to exploit it they will just get banned, it's simple.
---
On breaking immersion, I don't know having a bunch of people with -serverName walking around forever seems more immersion breaking to me than not really noticing that layering even exists except for sometimes when I join a group with a friend that just logged on. And for only the first few weeks of the game.
---
&gt;All of this just to avoid additional server maintenance costs.
---
This is just plain misinformed. Servers are just VMs, so whether Blizzard is running more servers, or extra layers they need the same hardware. Merging servers is really just allocating more resources to a particular "server" the same as changing a server from running 6 layers to just 1.
---
Whatever though, I'd be happy if you ended up not playing classic long term.
---
I don't remember the name of the starting quest, but it's about the disappearance of a Night elf Priestess in Ashenvale and you are sent look for a book on the opening quest or the follow up to it.
---
&gt;!It relates with Sven Yorgen's questline.!&lt;
---
Rammstein due to World of Roguecraft.
---
Aggro range is 20 yards for same level mob. It increases by 1 yard per level. Given that, for increasing your range to 36 yards to help you pull some mobs and not other you'd need to be attacking something around 10 levels higher than you. How often is a priest pulling something 10 levels higher than them while levelling?        
---
      
---
Obviously increasing your range is a very helpful talent for levelling, but yeah - the specific reason of helping you pull one mob and no others is pretty spurious. You did get me to look up how aggro range is calculated though so that's my new thing learnt about vanilla for the day.
---
Lmao pwned. You said it now HANDLE IT.
---
Find anything neat?
---
Oh interesting I will have to check it out when classic comes out
---
Fully agree, forgot to specify. As long as I can get out of the first couple zones without it literally taking a full week of waiting on mobs I'm happy, but anything beyond the first two zones I don't agree with sharding.
---
yeah, it is pretty weird.
---
Good news! Charles, xani, inukenshin, and khano have all said they want in. Charles especially being left out was a sin. We've got more horde and more ally players than that by a fair bit, and hopefully even more by wed!
---
And then other 100 people also got "lucky" that very same day!   
---
Ah, the whores...
---
which is legal here anyways so NBD.
---
You're really gullible if you believe what you said about the economy. It's okay, if you don't know anything about the subject matter it's really easy to get fooled by people that are trying to scare you into hating layering.
---
No one is staying awake for 96 hours.
---
If anything, people will account share.
---
Well, i have less free time now, that's for sure, but we can't think our generation is the unique generation that is going to play classic wow. I was 24 back in the days, but now there are other players with that age, and that free time.
---
Like the lion king sings, "in the endless cycle,
---
that moves us all,
---
and although we are alone..."!!! XDDD
---
Aw shit ez downvotes even though honest
---
Not that I am going to use anything, but if I were, it would be nicotine patches.  They are easier to get, though not terribly cheap.  You could easily get a week supply legitimately vs trying to get a doctor to get you an Rx for a stimulant.
---
\#nochanges
---
I bought gold for real money, i sold gold for real money, i boosted people in pve for gold/money. 
---
Will do the same again.
---
&gt;You are helping a friend
---
Not a PUG
---
&gt;You make loot arrangements with said warrior
---
Extra effort and you could still get it ninja'd
---
&gt;The other warrior is from your guild
---
&gt;You don't need to get all drops guaranteed but are OK farming it with the other warrior until both have it
---
Or I could just tell him to fuck off and guarantee I get it first, which is what Tanks do. 
---
If you want the gear, tank it yourself. Its easy AF to get a group as a tank.
---
Kek
---
Chat is across layers.  You can talk to anyone on your server on your faction.
---
Y2K memes come back
---
Err...rogues and druids will jump a mage all day long. Hunters were mentioned add shaman, lock and priest too. So yeah, I guess warriors will run the other way.
---
But a cheap, used 19-23” tv and use it as a second monitor. It’ll change your life.
---
Its not as if its going to stop all the i hate/dont hate layering posts, especially if its only up for 4 days.
---
Massdrop ALT, kaihl box pinks &amp; cream switches :3
---
TL;DR
---
MC was created in like a week as a secret project because they decided they needed raid content.
---
Gambling in general probably wasn't intended but I'm sure was pretty common.   
---
A group of us would go into a dark corner in the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar and have a gambling ring with /roll around a fire.  Good times.
---
Nothing beats his Guile Theme though!
---
Hunters only have CHT and Brutality blade to replace the set. Assuming bad drops, they could be using DalRends until AQ40. Weapons are hard as fuck to get in raids, and this is the best you can find until Barb of the Sand Reaver or MC/BWL stat sticks which are highly contested. You can rerun UBRS the same freaking day ffs.
---
Contested zones are not pvp, you can only PvP when you toggle onto them or enter a town/city. Running through silverpine or tirisfal glades will not auto toggle you.
---
Why's that?  Does something about the new client prevent it?  I know I used to use an addon to change my damage numbers back in vanilla.
---
\**Tips helm**
---
I have been told server. I do know custom chat channels are server wide so /world will be server wide.
---
I think regular chat channels (general, and trade) are server wide as well cause I talked to people that I couldn’t see until we grouped.
---
Just another question was this the last stress test or one of the first 2?
---
I hope Blizzard take notice. Making a remake like Classic...it's really in the details. Surely it is tough work but small things like this are more important than many believe. It contributes to that special feeling.
---
Besides, how am I supposed to do those sweet, sweet WF crits with just a scrolling text? Bring the popping chaos!
---
Its not that hard. Literally just totem twist Grace/WF. Eventually the melee will beg the raid for you to be included.
---
This guy has given me soo much entertainment over the last couple of days.
---
It's way too cute seeing someone attempt to be so aggressive and intimidating but just sound like an angsty teen.
---
I'm not so sure he is a troll, if you read other stuff he's posted on this account he seems to be someone with STRONG OPINIONS about everything social but absolutely zero social or argumentative skills.
---
My guess? Self righteous 16-22 year old.
---
Swimming around the whole continent.
---
Appreciate all the tips! Thank you so much.
---
Against warriors like myself you frost nova and sheep. Then either run away or try to get the opener. But if you fight, you always, always save that blink for Intercept. Nothing else. 
---
Many mages have died to massive execute crits because they did not save blink for intercept.
---
How do Shamans stack up in regards to gear dependency?
---
It takes 40 minutes a week to raid in phase 1. Not sure where you get the 6 to 9 hours from.
---
That would be realistic with MC+BWL+AQ40+ZG+AQ20.
---
If this macro thing is true I need it immediately
---
Awesome dude, interested in what you come up with!
---
I’m not grinding for world first or anything so min maxing efficiency isn’t a concern, just trying to level efficiently. I might even end up going night elf warrior now to synergize with the druids stealth, and that way we’ll just level together from the start
---
Nice grammar mistake. "A of couple more times"
---
I'm with you dude. If I'm on a mage or rogue or warrior and I know the enemy spriest has extra range instead of blackout I'd be extremely happy. I think for pvp blackout is a no-brainer.
---
This quest is mainly difficult because people dont know how to do it correctly. You can solo it early without problem. My buddy recently put up a video on how to do this because there wasn't a video on you-tube on how to do it correctly.. check it out here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5FR8Oq5wSw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5FR8Oq5wSw)

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKK7nR1Js9I&amp;t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKK7nR1Js9I&amp;t=10s)  didn't work this time
---
3% spell crit, no?
---
Played both druid and mage all the way to 60. Druid has no chance against mage.
---
Does it remove the Curse of Exhaustion? also the slows from frost mages
---
Just remember to level an alt as well so you can play when you want to and she doesn't otherwise: https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/12/31/a-being-of-indescribable-power
---
Anytime Asmongold was doing any group event on the beta the entire general chat was "INVITE ME TO ASMON LAYER". The general chat is 100% cross-layer.
---
I know right? I want 3k people in each race's starting zone as well. I'm sure the client side lag will be totally fine and everyone should be okay dealing with it. Who in their right mind expects to have good performance when a game launches?
---
I hope I'm dripping with enough sarcasm today.
---
I rolled my Shaman because my brother was very persistent in wanting me to roll one. Initially I wanted to roll an Orc Warrior, because I wanted to be a Grunt (big WC3 fan, and wanted to play WoW as such, despite not knowing what I could expect having never played an MMO before), but so I quit my Warrior before I ever left Durotar, and rolled an Orc Shaman, which I eventually really liked, because I got to emulate Thrall (made my Character to represent his appearance as much as possible). When I eventually reached 60 (took months), and gotten into MC, I was specced whatever. I think it was still enhancement. I never intended to roll a healer, because I had no idea what I was doing and getting in to. But I learned to really like healing, because I liked the idea of people depending on me, plus I was a raid healing, which was probably the most fun, because it was so dynamic. As a healer I liked the moments the most where you needed to suddenly in a fight go all out because health bars were dropping rapidly across the board. You needed to do triage very quickly. And despite your guild and raid leaders not knowing that you saved the raid (because they only saw healing meters), you knew that you made the difference.
---
As for farming gold. That was a bitch, at least a resto Shaman. All other healers could farm decently, but a Shaman healer is the worst to farm with.
---
You are best off skipping class quests. especially if you are duo/group leveling, nothing will be crucial enough to hold back other people. Do it on off hours. Early in the morning/late at night when your buddies aren't questing with you.
---
I honestly think the new numbers look aracady and that’s why I prefer the old ones

Omg, yes please.
---
Zzz...
---
&gt; Listening to the players
---
From someone who played in the vanilla days and browsed the European forums a lot, much of modern WoW came from things players suggested.
---
&gt;do PVP servers still focus on PVE content such as raids, dungeons,
---
Yes a lot of that gear makes you stronger in PvP. So even people who just want to PvP end up raiding.
---
Lol hell yah!
---
Weed whacking roots :D
---
They should do third story wise but gameplay wise dont change it.
---
The way I see it you could approach this from either a solo or a group perspective. If you plan to roll solo your probably best off with a self sufficient class like hunter, rogue or Druid. 
---
If you want to group you can probably have the greatest impact with the least investment by healing. Routinely, you could clear 5 mans without trouble with a healer several levels below the instance average. You’ll need some gear but you can do ok with a leveling spec and enough water.

I just want a tournament that anyone can sign up. I was under the impression (falsely it seems) that that tournament was streamers only. Even if it had been streamers only they have a right to do that. 
---
I felt like that tournament was missing a great deal of prominent alliance and horde pvpers, so I'm doing my own tournament. Their tournament was entertaining still. I only have beef with one specific streamer for posting videos showing him killing me 5-6 times, but not where he got killed a bunch of times.
---
Pretty much every class in Vanilla is either frustrating or boring to level in some way. I think priest isn't too bad, you can handle multiple mobs well, you have 0 downtime. I can see someone arguing that rogue/warrior is more fun abilities wise, but it's also very frustrating having to deal with multiple mobs, pets, enemies that snare and slow and all that annoying stuff. Hunter isn't frustrating at all but is literally an auto attack bot. I would rate the more boring than priest. Warlock is pretty similar to priest, you just constantly manage life and wand, you just have an annoying pet follow you around as well. Druid is probably the most engaging levelling class in vanilla, but then you're stuck playing a druid which is the least exciting class at 60 anyway...
---
Do you understand that your attitude makes you an asshole and pretentious dick? You clearly have implied in previous posts you were a PS player when you looked down on someone who played from *original beta* as not knowing as much as you about the game.
---
You're delusional if you think you can be cutsey and not explicitly imply you played on PS. Your behavior speaks for itself.
---
Yea that's kinda where I'm at. I remember it being so hard to find quests at certain levels.
---
I spewed out my coffee when I read this.  I just wasn’t expecting it.
---
Hello all,
---
My friends and I, (Warrior, Warrior, Priest) are recruiting (2) two dedicated players with experience to powerlevel upon WoW Classic release. Our goal is to level to 60 as a unit of (5) five going through dungeons and clearing with AoE cleave. This is a highly effective method of leveling and requires extreme coordination and time commitment. Our expected level speed to 60 is 4-5 days /played.
---
Requirements:
---
1.) Play either **SHAMAN, ENHANCEMENT** or **ROGUE, COMBAT**
---
2.) ***COMPLETE AVAILABILITY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION TUESDAY, AUGUST 27TH 7:00PM CST UNTIL SATURDAY, AUGUST 31ST 10PM CST IS A MUST (we will take a break / casual level / dungeon grind for gear on Sunday).***
---
\- We are not going to be absolutely insane about leveling ASAP, there will be planned breaks for 2-5 hours each day for sleep, food, etc.
---
3.) Aged 19-26, male or female, we don't care, with a microphone &amp; discord.
---
4.) Be available for a 5 minute interview via Discord
---
5.) Willingness to be told how to spec your class for the group structure and which professions to take
---
6.) Great attitude and eagerness to experience this style of leveling and make friends!
---
A little about us:
---
We have been gaming together for over 10 years, lead a mythic raiding guild, play other games, and socialized IRL (we all live in DFW). We have experience playing all classes and we each specialize in different aspects of the game. We are extremely effective in making gold, PvP, and overall organization / raid leading.
---
We see this as a unique opportunity to get to 60 quickly and start gearing up for raiding. We plan to level alts in the following weeks casually to experience all of the content later.
---
If you are interested in joining us, feel free to comment below and we will find a way to reach out (this is our first time using Reddit).

---
I would say one good thing about Shamans is that quite a few pieces of gear do not come from raids (half) and you can get pieces close to them from dungeons and other things. This is Elemental spec specifically. You would want to heal in Dungeons though, you go oom too fast as an Elemental Shaman.
---
Hey he got downvoted but your not wrong, weed creates a lot of issues. I’ve got bigger problems to deal with tbh, mainly that I can not drink in moderation - so to remain social I get blazed when I am out and about for social gatherings.
---
The two alternatives are drinking and getting into almost comical situations, and complete sobriety which I haven’t even done in over a decade.
---
Weed is destructive but considering in the past few months i’ve gone from smoking weed all day everyday to smoking on the weekends if a friend is around - its not something I worry about.
---
I have put a lot of drugs into my body over the last few years and alcohol is the one I struggle with the most.
---
No it has to be targeted I "think" so not aoe, but you can tame a beast in a zone and a lowbie thinks it's just a normal npc and attacks it, they are now flagged, a fun time.
---
As far as I know holy is the best healing spec in the game overall besides some paladins with unlimited mana. 
---
Go holy
---
I should have said aren't *necessarily* better haha
---
Cdew I've only seen fight in tourneys 1v1. Every time I've encountered him in game he's had a couple pocket healers. Because of that I've mainly fought him in group pvp.
---
For me, it was Basement Jaxx for leveling.
---
Duskwood and Winterspring are zones that make the game for me!
---
You act like everyone wants to be on the cutting edge, which just isn't true.
---
&gt;clips from actual vanilla of people hitting 2 people like 10+ yds 
---
I didn't say it wasn't possible, I said that it was more awkward and difficult to do. Besides, misses don't go into highlight clips
---
I think it gives the developers involved even more credit, being able to create one if not the most famous World of Warcraft raid, both praised and loved by players in a single week is something I would never imagine possible.

&gt;As far as I know there will not be battlegroups, or at least they are not planned for now since there won't be enough servers to support multiple battlegroups. 
---
[They have said cross realm battlegrounds will be a thing.](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=720) Which means either there will be battlegroups, or battlegroup. We don't know which, but that's literally the point I was making.
---
&gt;I just really hope they don't release AV with the other battlegrounds, because then it will be possible to grind honour effectively as a solo.
---
I had hoped similarly, but they're releasing AV in phase 3, along with WSG. With AB in phase 4.
---
I hear there's a pill for that.
---
Great, thanks for the info.
---
escape artist doesnt work either
---
LOL - I have my own story about playing Battlefield on acid. I can handle myself pretty well but when I was playing Xbox on it - I picked the Sniper class, sat in a bush and stared down the scope for a whole 30 minute game.
---
I was so busy looking at the fractals appearing in the ground, loving the texture etc that I forgot to play.
---
That's it!
---
How so?
---
WoW has earned 8.5 BILLION dollars since 2004.  From a corporate perspective, it's been an unbelievable success.  
---
Also, don't think for a minute that re-releasing Classic isn't a part of their profit-driven strategy.  They probably waited until the optimal moment when diminishing returns from retail necessitated a re-launch to maximize profits from the franchise. 
---
 Just look at the hype on this Sub, they're going to print money.
---
:(
---
I party agree; extra gear would be sweet. Maybe some tiny balance issues too
---
Don't worry, someone will make an addon to fix it.
---
ELfs are great toys :D
---
Major cities being a different layer than the surrounding zone isnt good for immersion. Imagine standing at the entrance of Org and you see people phasing in and out going from layer to layer
---
By that point, gold was actually worthless.
---
Very true - I can’t remember how old I was 100% because it was more then half of my life ago. 
---
I joined in 05’ - can’t really be bothered doing the math.
---
I didn't say it was vanilla.
---
You're doing 5 days 16 hours and practicing beforehand with customised group and you're taking an off-heals druid?    
---
   
---
I think the best 5th for this would probably be a warlock, just because the biggest efficiency killer you're going to have is vendor/respec runs (for instance you have 10 levels at SM which is a huge run to get to as alliance). So yeah unless you can count on a friendly guildie nearby to teleport you all around it's going to slow you down a lot.
---
Yea but is that enough to ban someone?
---
I said this during the demo and was told it was the old numbers.  Actually glad this is posted and got upvotes finally!!!
---
Grouping with random players is what you do in retail with dungeon finder.
---
So I’m guessing the book is worth it?
---
You don't need the whole raid pushing optimal dps, no.  But I can't imagine too many people would be happy to carry dead weight... even if they can do it.
---
Magmadar\*
---
The biggest misconception is that you have to RP anything really. Just act normal and don't talk about RL stuff and you're good. Talking about the game while on the game as if it's the world you're on is all that's required. 
---
You don't have to go deeper than that. I definitely wouldn't. It's basically the best way to play since it makes the game feel more like a game and less like a min/Max memefest.
---
and pls make gameplay faster
---
A dude in Masters I was talking too, didn’t really understand it either. Some people in this thread have mentioned psychadelics like DMT so maybe some people are just weird af.
---
That still sounds awful. Classic is all about server community and meaningful connections, both friendly and hostile. Layering fucks it and keeps people in the same zones from ever meeting.
---
Saw a chart the other day on the Rank breakpoints,  Rank 14 is the top 0.003% of PvPers, Rank 9 is 0.1%.  I don't remember exactly what Rank 10 was but I'm sure it's not difficult to find.
---
I really don't like the new look. The old one is just awesome.
---
I have had a high tolerance too weed for years so its hard for me to assess tbh. I know for a fact I avoid indica like the plague because if I have it I end up sleeping during the afternoon - awake all night and my sleeping pattern goes to shit.
---
And? You can still make meaningful connections with the other 3k people in your layer.
---
Considering how Blizzard has handled expansions, the thought of expansions  how they are currently implemented should be the last thing they do.
---
You can't take something away from the whole and expect a fair illustration. I played the classic beta to level 20 and I experienced the layering first hand. In vanilla wow you could moonwalk. The combat damage text is different. The animations are different when jumping. This game does not cater to people that want to play vanilla, this caters to some inbetween half breed wow player that accepts sharding as a necessity when its not. Sharding is absolutely antithetical to vanilla.
---
Regarding the difference - PEG is used as a base, shitty / unregulated dealers put more of it in the juice to dilute it - making them more money. The problem is PEG is explicity carcinogenic and wouldn’t even be allowed in medical THC carts..
---
If you look at the post I made in trees, someone from a medical facility in nevada posted a link to clean test results.. most street weed would fail every one of those tests in a second.
---
It's called The WoW Diary by John Staats.  Its on Amazon
---
The original code is there, that's good enough for me.
---
The first number to pop up on the retail version is a huge crit that pops. 
---
You can't even tell what is happening in the vanilla clip because every number pops all over the place
---
If you want everything to be quick that’s what retail is for. 
---
I am quite aware of what the technical differences are, I just dont care. The end result is more or less the same. Id rather have more servers instead of some strange hybrid.
---
Maybe you should stop assuming that there is only one opinion to be had that could be potentially correct.
---
Is it possible to play Classic without upgrading to BFA? Just need an active sub right? If so, is anybody else just reactivating their ancient accounts?
---
 *I don’t give a fuck who you are or where you live. You can count on me to be there to bring your fucking life to a hellish end. I’ll put you in so much fucking pain that it’ll make Jesus being nailed to a cross in the desert look like a fucking back massage on a tropical island. I don’t give a fuck how many reps you have or how tough you are IRL, how well you can fight, or how many fucking guns you own to protect yourself. I’ll fucking show up at your house when you aren’t home. I’ll turn all the lights on in your house, leave all the water running, open your fridge door and not close it, and turn your gas stove burners on and let them waste gas. You’re going to start stressing the fuck out, your blood pressure will triple, and you’ll have a fucking heart attack. You’ll go to the hospital for a heart operation, and the last thing you’ll see when you’re being put under in the operating room is me hovering above you, dressed like a doctor. When you wake up after being operated on, wondering what ticking time bomb is in your chest waiting to go off. You’ll recover fully from your heart surgery. And when you walk out the front door of the hospital to go home I’ll run you over with my fucking car out of no where and kill you. I just want you to know how easily I could fucking destroy your pathetic excuse of a life, but how I’d rather go to a great fuckng length to make sure your last remaining days are spent in a living, breathing fucking hell. It’s too late to save yourself, but don’t bother committing suicide either… I’ll fucking resuscitate you and kill you again myself you bitch-faced phaggot. Welcome to hell, population: you*
---
Okaaaaaay dude i'm not gonna read the book you just wrote me -_- 
---
&gt;Adequate sleep enhance performance. Should we ban that? Proper nutrition?
---
I'm talking about performance enhancing DRUGS ffs...........

&gt;   It's been proven that my opinion is correct.

---
Of all the things you could've picked to argue with , you chose the one thing that is so true to the point that blizzard had to alter it, yet even that didn't fix it, having people standing right next to others in the same group but not being able to see each other due to the lockout breaks immersion even more.
---
All I hear is some dude fighting to defend a company that doesn't really give a shit about its playerbase anymore, and the sad thing is you probably think I'm some pserver hillbilly coming here to trash talk blizzard but in reality I've played every single expansion that they've made and seen them slowly turn this awesome game into the shitfest it is today.
---
If you don't question decisions then there is no limit to what we can argue is an "improvement" to the game. Let's fix this problem with servers!, let's tweak some stats on hybrid dps classes!, let's remove the debuff limits completely!, let's fix itemization so all specs are functional !, let's give all tanks taunt ! let's give all dps interrupts ! Let's make HS shorter ! Let's add a way to find groups faster !   When do we stop ? how much is too much really ? who decides which opinion is more valuable and relevant than another ? at some point you have to realize that this is all headed down a very familiar road , we might as well rename classic to BFA.
---
There is no problem with finding solutions to modern problems but classic is meant to be a remastered game , it should be a museum showing how it was , exactly as it was. Not with flavor and paint here and there, Vanilla wow had problems, no shit. We're playing classic because we want that specific version of the game , it's flaws define it.
---
Servers had issues in 2004, people dealt with them. They can deal with them again, it'll be especially less dramatic now that everyone knows exactly how the system works and which servers they'll aim for.
---
And then they never, ever did it again lol.
---
Right so do I but i’m not deluded into thinking it makes me a better leveller. I used to think it made me better at instruments too, until I recorded myself and realized everything just sounded a lot better.
---
The first one. Vael is stupidly easy if DPS can press their buttons.
---
You can absolutley be a casual min maxxer. You dont spend as much time in game as the no lifers but you can absolutley still optimize your class and min max to a tee given a smaller time constraint
---
Soylent
---
One layer has 50 people in a zone another layer has 10.  People on the 10 person layer get advantage on mats and mobs.  Layering is just not a good thing for how vanilla wow was designed.  All the nonsense a put people swapping layers during pvp and to loot items was talked about and seen in the beta.  Imma be honest I dont know how to fix layering because the idea of it is to please a player base and enable smooth launch when I'm more for just saying its everyman for himself and good luck.  Its not like you will be stuck forever
---
This. Isn't. 2004. Take off the rose tinted glasses. I'm telling you from actual experience playing actual progression servers, you will absolutely see the fruits of layering in 6 months time. Nobody will even remember or care about layering at that point. What they will appreciate is the fact there are still people at 60 to play with and not being on a dead server.
---
Yep, most progression raids will want optimized specs/comp, but in 2019...well is it really progression anymore? Naxx, tho, will demand it
---
Ah yes that's the demographic! I'd forgotten, it's been a while.
---
My headcannon for this guy now is that he's the one guy in my physics lectures who read atlas shrugged then decided to wear an I'll fitting suit everywhere (without improving is shaving or hygiene habits) that just never grew up past lecturing everyone on how we'd all be living in utopia by now if we just stopped getting in the way of powerful people doing whatever they liked.
---
Rock climbing was awesome until the patched it :(
---
Thanks captain obvious!
---
omg what would we ever do without those ice mages?
---
Questie ftw.
---
idk about Joana's guides, since speedrun guides tend to require practice to execute em fairly well.
---
This is an example of someone who has no idea what they're talking about.
---
Peggie was my jam. I only ever played it in WoW.
---
In fairness there are some alchemy potions that are pretty OP in PVP too.
---
There is a small subset of both casuals zmd min maxxers who hate on eachother for their respective playstyles.  Im a min maxxer but could literally care less how anyone plays the game. There is no right or wrong way to go about it. You will inadvertantly surround yourself with like minded players. No reason to hate the other. Plus un informed casuals are easy pvp pickins id never berate them for making easy HKs lol
---
I don't think anyone ever said it won't affect gameplay lol... they just don't want it in classic because it wasn't in vanilla.
---
Oh well, can't wait to just play in August and have everyone forget about layering :)
---
My recount says otherwise &gt;:)
---
(USA, Central Time)
---
\- We are not going to be absolutely insane about leveling ASAP, there will be (8) eight hours for sleep and a few hour breaks throughout the day for miscellaneous needs.
---
Yeah, keep kidding yourself if you think nobody has ever called someone an elitist jerk for no good reason.
---
People should not be insulted for an "anti rpg" behavior.
---
Pokerface by Lady Gaga
---
World 1836521th players probably do too tbh
---
Vael fight, after that it is easy, relatively speaking
---
Remove layering
---
They already fixed the pvp and gathering layer swapping, you're basing your opinion on old data.
---
Regarding the imbalance, you act as if once a layer has 50 people it will never add more players, there is constant balancing happening behind the scenes so the chances of one layer remaining grossly imbalanced for an extended period of time is very low.
---
Kinda looks like a toilet flushing.
---
I didn’t see it, but you can macro to eat and drink with 1 button.

the ventrilo raging raid leader, now that IS classic wow
---
Well i own a company, seems smart enough for me. Dont be rude cause youre a loser.
---
If you get the mark on the vael fight, go run into the corner and die like a good boy
---
Questie doesn’t have a guide does it? Do you mean vanillaguide? Joana’s isn’t really a speedrun guide though. At least not the one posted publicly on his website. It’s just efficient questing and pathing which is nice because getting the stupid vendor items and AH buyable quest turnins ahead of time saves me so much time.
---
Yes. It doesn't make you play better but smooths out the leveling/grinding pain :D 
---
Cba to play sober.
---
Its nbd, it’ll be gone soon. People are making way too big a deal of it. Its a better answer than the game being unplayable or dynamic respawn
---

PEEL 4 UR HEALERZ
---
because layering isnt zone to zone or lvl to lvl, its the whole world.
---
Definitely agree on that point. If you want to push the meta to the edge you need to play the optimal class and spec. Doubt there will be too many druids. But honestly I don’t foresee much trouble for people just trying to clear within the first month of release. I’m sure boomies will he brought to some raids within the first month of AQ and maybe even clear. Naxx we’ll have to see; pservers pumped the shit out of an already hard raid so it may be the same case. As long as you’re committed enough as a player (full consumes, WB, perfect rotation and mechanical awareness) you’ll be able to clear every raid eventually.
---
Corruption cannot crit, therefore is way lower dps than shadowbolt (especially at higher gear levels / with world buffs). It should only be used on fights you're moving around
---
TATW! I didn’t get into them until post wow when I became a gym rat circa 2011 and they were already doing Group Therapy. Still love listening to old episodes every once in a while though.
---
RemindMe! 3 months
---
Lots of people struggle with it.  My guild never did, but then again we all learned out jobs well after getting stuck on Razorgore for 3 months.
---
Underoath, As I Lay Dying, Abigail Williams
---
Absolutley. I plan on getting my script fillef just for this reason alone. I cant do longer than 24 hours strait without sleep anymore but the first day or two im going for 16 or so hours sober. And then when the fatigue kicks in on day three start hitting the adderall.
---
Damn did you feel the same after getting off antidepressants
---
Welp, guess I'll have to actually lvl a priest.
---
1. At launch everyone will play from every country, every timezone that exists
---
2. At launch people will take time off from the jobs, school, other duties
---
This means that at launch or atleast the 1st week before people go back to their usual daily schedule its gonna be PACKED.  
---
2-3 weeks after people have gone back to work, people have their set gaming schedules and some people would have already grown tired of playing. Having queue times then would be 100% acceptable and something you should expect and plan around.
---
BFA, WoD, dailies, world quests, LFD/LFR, ability pruning.
---
good DPS do good DPS.  bursting specific targets is the job of an assassin, who are bad DPS.
---
Did we just discover the identity of Ooga Gang?
---
I don't have a strong opinion either way, as I see both advantages and disadvantages of layering. That being said, you speak of layering as if it is a perfect system that will have no complaints, and just like the other side you wrote this post about, you too have an "extreme" point of view. People that are playing on the beta have been very vocal with their complaints from their first-hand experience, regarding issues with immersion &amp; abuse potential, so how can you say this will be successful to the point that no one will complain whatsoever come launch?
---
I think the most balanced perspective is that every option of dealing with these issues has both positives and negatives and while I do have many issues with layering, I'm not convinced there is a better alternative.
---
Paladin is solid for a beginner.
---
Have you seen BfA?
---
THIS. The game is designed around having 1 layer. 
---
BuT iTs 2019 - NeED LAyeRs. 
---
Get ready to see this game get flayed by bad reviews on day one because they didn't listen to the community over layering.
---
You suck. This was kinda funny
---
This isn't even that insidious.  The most disgusting thing I've seen Blizzard do was in China when they pulled the old Vanilla eBay scheme of, "buy this $500 t-shirt, and get a complimentary WoW account".
---
Selling game time was just a way to combat gold selling in unoffical markets.  Where the China issue was to fuck consumers over as hard as they could.
---
the better the mindset the player in the age of the internet, the better developers can work. it's funny how even to enjoy a game due to the internet we have to educate ourselves more. Since our readily available voice can also fuck over developers more.
---
so tequila doesn't make me know kung-fu? damn
---
Wall walking and exploring forbidden places like under Stormwind, the Dwarven airport area, Hyjal, blnking through the Deadmines portal inside and wandering thorugh all sorts of dev places, those upside down floating corpses under Karazan.
---
I hope you can still get to a few...
---
yeah easier to just strafe away tho
---
also fun fact you dont get dazed if you are defense capped
---
yes you can, atleast it works on private server
---
the irony is palpable
---
They sound like extreme anarchists tbh I mean I've been exposed to a fair bit of anarchy theory and all the reasonably plausible theories seem to involve some kind of regulation, just smaller in scale so all the insane people can go live somewhere that makes them happy.
---
I actually love shadow banning for this reason, people that want to just have a nice relaxed environment get it, people that enjoy strife get to play with all the people that enjoy strife. Everyone wins except the people that enjoy inflicting strife on people who don't want it and well fuck those people because they're awful and I don't much care if their preferences aren't satisfied.
---
The servers do handle thousands of players at once, the WORLD does not, Azeroth isnt suited for 10-15k players online at once.
---
&gt;I’m gonna play as a Horde character btw.
---
I used to always play Living on a Prayer running through stv and fighting in Gurubashi.
---
True.
---
I'm not trying to invalidate your opinion at all, I'm just saying plenty of people would argue mage/warrior/rogue(and certainly paladin) levelling is as boring or more boring than priest levelling.    
---
    
---
Also (you may not mean this), but spirit tap does not encourage people to not use abilities for it's buff duration at all - actually the opposite. The ideal priest situation is to keep spirit tap up 24/7, but if you can't do that you should try to do all your casting inside it's duration. It sets base regen to 100% so there's no benefit at all in trying to be outside 5sec rule while sprit tap is up.
---
I thought holy paladin was the easiest. At end game you just spam flash of light, cleanse, and shield on a mage here and there. You can accidently take aoes and shit with the personal bubble. 
---
Priest to me has so many types of heals to cast and so much downranking. And just sooo many spells and stuff to cast in general
---
Can someone ELI5 for a returning player who hasn't played WoW in over ten years?
---
Really debating on buying this book, but this read was awesome. 
---
Is the rest of the book similar to this? How have others who have read it liked it?
---
I would be more than happy carrying someone who got my alt or my guildie gear by spamming 5/10 mans as a tank or healer. 
---
Also how do you quantify dps? Moonkin aura is 3% spell crit for all of the other casters which I’m sure is very appreciated. Innervate is awesome. Worst case your completely oom and you go into cat form to do hunter pet damage. Druids have great utility to. Oh, my tanks dead; mana pot brez and maybe even bearform tank a hit or two until your tank can retake aggro (to be real I never see that happening). 
---
Is a boomkin or other meme spec going to be in a core 40 man roster of a realm/world first raiding guild? Nope. Probably not even the top 10%. But there are a lot of guilds out there that would rather have a good raider behind the screen; showing up, bringing consumes, helping summon, gear running alts, providing utility to the raid through special buffs and abilities, than another deep arcane/frost mage that shows up does his job then /afks until the next raid.
---
A shaman outside a melee group?
---
The council of warriors would like to know your location.
---
Classic gold is harder to come by than retail gold to buy a token. I can't see many people wanting to give up hard earned classic gold.
---
I feel like shaman. Super low stress, only have 3 heal spells (not counting different ranks) so knowing what to use never gets super complicated. Your totems are super helpful - especially disease and poison cleansing totems as well as Tremor. They cost barely any mana at all and will remove all related effects on party members for the next 2 minutes. Super strong and easy for dungeons. Having just leveled one on a pserver it's super easy. Healed the whole way up as Enhancement while just keeping a healing set of gear. Which mostly just consisted of gear with intellect.
---
Full disclosure I'm playing a healing priest in Classic but I've found Shaman to be much less complicated and easy to heal with.
---
But Loot Council is subjective where DKP has set rules for acquiring and spending points.
---
They can "fuck with loot council" without you even knowing because they can justify the decision in some way.
---
They fuck with DKP and then you can instantly gquit and others will follow because the clear rules were broken.
---
I'm not saying DKP is perfect just that slimy decisions can be made through LC without you even knowing they're happening where DKP at least it will be blatantly obvious they broke the the rules.
---
100% im so tired of explaining that layering doesnt fucking work ZONE by ZONE or like 1-20 zones only and then when u go into duskwood its all of a sudden gone LOL.  
---
and the fact that they think basically layering works like sharding in starting zones to deal with (overcrowding)...
---
You have to interpret what he says through the lens of a game designer. [They don't consider the technical limitations.](https://xkcd.com/1425/)
---
No, changing layers happens much more fluidly with layering as it is now.  What I mean is separate realms entirely, except for a shared name database for merging after phase 1, and some way for players to invite their friends onto their layer... only way to get on a full layer is to use such an invite to start a character on an otherwise full (closed to character creation) layer.  Layers would operate same as regular realms and be merged as populations spread out/diminish after initial interest.
---
Don't bully u/KrisWoW he is a proud Internet Explorer user.
---
He doesn't know that when he posts a video with months old clips, most of them showing an interaction that has since been patched, he kinda looks like a fool.
---
Dead weight &gt; 39 man guild if the dead weight is contributing some damage, buffs and utility. This is such strange take too; if my guildie did me and everyone else favors in dungeon spamming, farming consumes, quests and random pvp shit I’d be more than happy to carry his meme spec ass in a raid or two. If he wants to raid and gear as boomkin, he better make himself damn worth it.
---
