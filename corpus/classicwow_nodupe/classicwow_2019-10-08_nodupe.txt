The average player is not 60, you would have to play pretty hardcore to be 60 already.

---
I consider myself average and have been playing here and there since release and just hit lvl 25

I'm 38 with 80 from skinning everything I kill haven't touched the AH

Same here man... I feel like it’ll be a super fresh take on PvP in the game.  I’m imagining it playing a little bit like DAoC’s PvP with groups of 5 rolling around fighting each other and massive raid zergs doing the same in various places.  Looking forward to it.
---
I actually do this too.
---
I know a lot of people say "it doesn't matter", but it does.
---
You're more likely to support your average Joe by doing that rather than supporting AH goblins

As a healer that spent 50 runs in Jed/Rend until I finally got my Briarwood Reed, I would gladly join a pyro/Jed run and skip the 10+min Rend event.

i love how its an opinion piece and titled "the truth hurts" lmfao.

Lul I remember having frostbolt in 2 different spots to stop finger cramps :)
---
LFG channel will over-represent the hardcore players though because they're on half the day while the casuals are on only rarely, plus most casuals aren't spamming for ZF GY runs, they're just questing. A single hardcore player could easily produce as much LFG spam as a dozen casuals. 
---
I do agree 60's are a dime a dozen on my server though.
---
Please elaborate on this.
---
Honestly, I think the whole ninja looter thing is just an excuse.   Straight up ninja looters are really rare from my experience.
---
Not a big fan of this decision.  Just hit 53 tonight.  Not happy to see they’re adding content in a week that wasn’t planned for months because there is ‘demand’ for more content.
---
As someone on a severely imbalanced server (or at least it sure feels like that) this terrifies me.

He messaged me yesterday but I found out that WoW doesn't have a screenshots folder :(
---
Yea im in the middle of a scan and repair. Crossing my fingers.
---
Okay, well, if we're talking about majority, the majority people who rolled on Classic probably didn't get past level 20.
---
So which majority matters? The majority of people who are on every day for at least 2 hours for the last month and a half? Most of them are probably over 50 or at 60 and have been doing dungeons/raid for a couple weeks.
---
Or the majority of people who log on at least once a week? Or a month? Five hour investment per week cutoff? Twenty? Fifty?

Some leather is BiS for warriors
---
hi Araxom im trying to find information about what this update was about. can you please help me find? what exactly did it change?
---
Judging from my experience with warriors, you died because you attacked something while you were on 15% health, even after I gave you three stacks of mage food.
---
I agree that most people are not 60, but if you only JUST hit 25 I think you're pretty far below average.

You have to work around these things in classic. If your screech pulls in a dungeon then disable it for that dungeon. I’ve had ppl rage at me bc of the screech noise and I just disable. It’s not a dps loss so it doesn’t hurt your performance in the dungeon, more focus for claw as well actually. 
---
Owl is more of a soloing pet anyway. The screech is mostly useful to hold threat and make your bird tankier, both things you don’t need in a dungeon. Owl with screech and improved armour is tanky af.
---
Depends on your definition of casual.
---
Retail's casual player is ideally someone who has an hour or two a day. Enough time to clear whatever world quests need doing with days set aside for m+ and maybe islands.
---
Classic's casual player is ideally a weekend warrior who doesn't have to be on daily but wants to be on for long periods of time so they don't have to leave midway through a dungeon.
---
Except we wouldn’t have classic wow without pserver players being so vocal about wanting a proper legacy server, would we? 
---
I know you won’t say thank you, so.. You’re welcome.
---
A tank, a healer and 3 DPS just like any other instance.
---
This is correct. Was a common misunderstanding back in vanilla
---
ITT: Max level players who spent the last month complaining about all the content being cleared already who have suddenly turned face now that the pre BiS lists are about to change.
---
So what? You have more content to play now, why the salt?
---
Joined wow too late to ever enjoy mc dungeon, too family man to enjoy them in classic. Lvl 39 and don't expect to be 60 for another 2 months. Hopefully DM is still relevant by December I guess.
---
Yeah just doing a sample of online at a single moment will skew towards higher levels because they're the kind of people who are more likely to be on at any given moment. If you did a pie chart of "hours online in the last week" it would be majority 60s by a lot I bet.
---
If you macro /stopcasting for your HS you can get the benefit for your offhand swing and cancel it before the mainhand hit. It's a quirk of vanilla that increases DW DPS.
---
Nah, I’ve fully quested to 60 as a lock a few times on classic. You get enough spell damage gear from levelling.  
---
I’d still suggest running dungeons once for the fun and to get used to dungeons.
---
Well, they are fire-breathing dragons...
---
This guy defrags.
---
You've got this completely backwards. *Most* servers are completely single-layer, and only a few have just two layers remaining during peak times. Many are permanently set to one layer.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/realm-layering-update/320767
---
That's an ineffective pita compared to just hotting yourself out and charging in
---
The DM release is perfect for you then, 2 weeks should be enough to get 60 / near 60 even casually, then you can get all the good DM loot and be far more prepared for your first raid.

Freakin a stack of nightfin soup on my server is like 2g wtf i stopped selling them and started using them
---
The economy of my server is shit one of the reason i moved to another server and left my 53 mage
---
Rogues can definitely be useful D in WSG.
---
He's got it backwards. All but a few are now permanently 1-layer, and the ones that aren't permanent never have more than two.
---
The average iq of a person using quest helpers is definitely higher than people not using them.  People not using them are dumbass kids, old people, and a tiny niche of morons who think it's fun to run around looking for shit because they're uber casuals.

I vote DMN = Deadmines and DML = Dire Maul.

Don't think you can shield players not in your party or raid.

I feel like that joke has probably been made a million times, but damn, it got me *good.*
---
Actually, bears need less time than warriors for threat generally.
---
But yeah it doesn't matter regardless if dps go ham before you've even done any white damage or taken any hits.
---
Ah the 2h axe version of the lobotomizer
---
They wont miss out on content, majority of content will be relevant through till naxx. Even in nax people will be running MC for bindings amd such. They are literally just releasing a single dungeon, which argueably should probably just have been there at launch anyways.
---
Yeah, I’m kind of disappointed.  Makes me feel like I’m leveling way too slow now having just hit 53.  Felt like I was going at a fine pace and just enjoying myself.  That’s kind of ruining the feeling now and making me feel like I’m going to end up ‘missing out’ on stuff.
---
That information is not yet available, but if the Devs do make that info public (which I expect to be the case) then it would be shared eventually via a Hotfix blog which would be posted in our [News](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news) section of our Community page.

If you just want to play classic you only need a one month subscription. If you cancel your subcription after you load in you will be able to continue playing classic for free after the subscription runs out. 
---
Hope you have fun!
---
Looting a chest in the open world is not bad player behavior and sending mail to a guild master over not getting 7s and some cheese is just obnoxious.
---
I was gonna upvote you, but you’re at 69.  Nice!
---
lol, most people playing the game aren't 60, simple as that, and most people did not take a week off to play a video game. most people also have other hobbies. for most people, this game is not their priority.
---
it's a question of timescale and intent. if the intent is that the content is released on par with how quickly people manage to clear it, there are those (like you) who can prioritize playing this video game, and hence to keep up with the demand of this marginal community, things should be released at the rate they consume it, as you advocate.
---
on the other end is the majority of working adults who do want to experience classic, but can't keep up or make the game a priority outside of work. those who "missed out" the first time and want things released at a slower pace. this is the largest percentage of the playerbase
---
I'm in the same boat. Level 43 and I'm not sure how much longer my wife will put up with my current play time!
---
&gt;just wait for phase two, you'll have war everywhere. it's gonna be awesome just gotta hold on for a little more!
---
i know, cant wait!
---
All our healers get that first friend, our raid calls our dps casters fair game so i got to roll
---
(also til eye has a 50% drop rate)
---
In effect, it is legit just a system that allows single word communication to both healers and melee that the tank has been knocked back, the offtank has taken control, melee is allowed to move in.
---
If you are undergeared for content, having clear instructions and communication is vital.
---
I always keep good 1h weapons on me for rough occasions. 
---
Honestly, level as a dual wield warrior and you’ll be blown away at how much affective you are. More rage, more attempts at hits, and generally, way less likelihood of not causing damage for more than 3 seconds. 
---
I’ve been a warrior for 15 years - Ama.
---
We ran a guild MC run and offered to sell some of our loot that we didn’t need anymore. Our server almost shit itself. We then offered up free gear to anybody who could douse a rune in MC. Not a single whisper. Your post is fucking spot on.
---
So why as a seller would I intentionally take less money by not undercutting by a copper
---
5 days at 50, I fucked off a lot after that on my faster war.
---
I got 59-60 done in 7 hours with 3 ubr runs. 
---
I really think 5 days played for 1-60 is doable if I commit. 
---
If I had access to perfect situation, or could clone myself, 4 days.
---
I might squeeze in 30mins after work a few days a week and then I also play a few hours on my 1 day off on the weekend
---
Yeah people like this are straight up annoying
---
Angry words!
---
You don’t feel this is going to speed up the rest of the content being released?
---
Cool if I click the chest first it's mine.

oh okay no problem thank you for the quick reply

Hunter can do it in greens, but needs engineering to skip a door with seaforium. And then you just kite the shit out of last boss.
---
Feels good to know people share the same pain as mine. Ive almost gone insane at this point
---
You are already behind, so I wouldn't worry about that too much.
---
I like the hybrid thing in general, and I like it more than druid because I can do the same thing but don't have to change forms.
---
From a practical standpoint, I like having access to three different playstyles/roles, rather than being limited to two or even one.
---
Tanks charging money for runs? You split that with the healer right? Never heard of this..

nibba its fucking autumn its cold and raining why the fuck would i go outside

Cause your mother was blowing me under the table clearly ur a load she should have swallowed

Scarlet crusade with a "fire emblem"?  I know a Canadian flag when I see one.
---
Part of any rpg, including wow, is that your decisions matter. You can’t go back and try to change your decision on a quest reward because you thought BB was important for your enhancement spec. 
---
If the functionality to change your mind later on isn’t readily apparent in game, you should take more than a moment to decide if the decision you’re making is the best one. These lasting impacts on your character are important in maintaining the feel of an RPG. 
---
It seems modern wow would be a solid game for you to try if you want reversible decisions and very little lasting impact on the very few permanent choices in the game like quest rewards.
---
If you’re farming pre-raid BiS you’re already not having an authentic Vanilla WOW experience.
---
I mean it is useful but it’s not game breaking. The group can go on without your owl screech, it’s not every dungeon that you’ll have to disable it.
---
Dude, most people playing now are not 60, thats an absurd claim with no basis in reality.
---
True, but releasing contact in accordance with the timeline of the top 0.1% is not a good way to go about the schedule. Many, of not most players lead busier lives now that in vanilla.
---
Same,
---
Yeah, I think if you're used to playing a ton you just start to get addicted to that feeling of progressing quickly and efficiently and even being relatively ahead of the curve as a result. Compare that to logging on like maybe 2 hrs a day, probably just giving you time to run a dungeon and *maybe* do a few quests -- I'd imagine it would just leave you feeling unsatisfied, wishing you could play more.
---
That’s dope tbh. Fast af.
---
40? Bruh I’m level 14.
---
Thats what happens when you only have a few hours every weekend to play.
---
I farm gold here and defend my mage aoe farming gold. We also practice PvP here and make Horde die until they death rez. Id say were making Azeroth a better place.
---
No the character selection page is fine just after I load in then I can see trees sky all that jazz but the ground is blacked out and I cant move
---
With Dire Maul happening, can anyone walk me through if it's possible for a group of rogues to do the tribute run? I've found some VERY old posts referencing this being possible with a solo rogue in AQ gear. If you had a few it might be possible but to be honest, I didn't run it much in Vanilla.
---
Priests still have lots of loot from BRD.
---
Skinning dagger with fiery

This is why they've been adding these "power treadmills" for a while in the form of azerite and artifact power etc. You can run forever on the treadmill and nothing really improves.

Lol, I know right. Take the one day ban. Fuck it, stick it to the man.

do weapon swing timers matter as a rogue?? in my warr alt it doesn't seem to affect much whether i do after or before the swing.
---
Amateurs play little games, we kill.
---
Ah thanks for letting me know.
---
Blizz doesnt really care about your preBIS and as its not nearly needed for the current released content...id just chill out.
---
Isn't it obvious why they asked? They explained why in their initial comment.
---
I said I tried. Didn't say it always worked.
---
I’m a 47 arms warrior, when should I switch to fury spec? Do I need to wait until I get more hit or as long as I stick to swords and maces as a human I should be fine? I think I read in another thread that after you get the thrash blade is a good time.
---
Dreaming in technicolor. They just want to stop the hemorrhage of players.
---
The community in Classic has made me across the board happy with how helpful everyone is being.
---
The dungeons can easily be done in 1-7 days to get preraid bis, and MC can be done in under 2 hours once a week and raidlog, and BWL isn't even out yet... so I don't know what point you're trying to make.
---
It was enough content back in 2004 when nobody knew what to do or what items to get or where to get items.
---
Now with ease of access to online databases and 15 year old theorycraft, there's virtually no content because all the items your class 'needs' can be done in under a week, for casual players maybe 2 weeks. 
---
For the few 2 hours /played a week players, then sure I guess it'll be a few weeks to over a month.
---
Have you considered that casuals don't want catchup gear 2 months into release?
---
Level a Mage / Hunter or have fun getting left in the gold inflation dust :s
---
I think PvP is a pretty massive amount of content. A lot will be grinding 12 hours a day for the next 3 1/2 months for rank 14, most others will at least spend several weeks farming. Battlegrounds will be massive. I mean, warsong gulch itself played a huge role in WoW’s history. And it gives more time for casual players to get into raids and catch up
---
Wowhead tracks it for both Europe and America.
---
I also got it on my first kill, but I camped for 15 hours straight.
---
I remember loading up one of the servers the summer the game came out and there were literally 100 orcs trying to do the starting quests. There were boar corpses for miles around and that first named kill had a queue.
---
Best advice I can give is to not level enchanting. Unless you’re dedicated to it (which the average player and myself aren’t, likely) it’s more of a money sink.  
---
You could still keep it and disenchant mats to save for after you’ve got your mount.
---
hunter with engineering (for seaforium charges) can solo tribute runs.
---
I don't go out on the weekends and only hit 60 last night.
---
In vanilla Dire Maul released a month and a half before Rag was killed. On classic, Dire Maul is coming out a month and a half after Rag was killed. 
---
Few people did much of MC without DM gear back then. And everyone completed MC with DM gear.
---
Executioner's Axe is nearly as good and doesn't break your bank.
---
Don’t forgot he would have been part of this hardcore crowd had he been playing Classic. I’m sure he sympathises with those poor poor players..
---
For tanking?
---
So it's better that people run mc now, which a lot of people already are, and replace the epics they get with dungeon blues in a month? The items from dm does not invalidate all other items mate. Some are minor upgrades, some are a bit larger. But it's not game changing. Mc and ony is already easy - they will continue to be easy, and one or two gearslots from dm isn't changing the game a whole lot.
---
Both paladin and warlock get the 60% mount free. The 100% mount u cant get till DM is out.
---
Remember when Blizzard said before Classic came out that decisions would be made from community feedback? I feel like this decision is a "knee jerk" reaction to a loud minority of content creators who do this as a job and have done everything in phase 1 so far. So far there is a lot of negative feedback from the community for it being too soon.
---
Indeed.
---
I haven’t even got my warlock to level 25 yet, I’ll be glad to be able to start saving gold and preparing for my dreadsteed questline when I hit 60 now.
---
Does this mean warlocks can get our epic mounts finally or do we still have to wait for ph2?
---
There was just a really small update. Idk what it was for but my launcher just downloaded like 700mb. May have something to do with it.
---
Let's be real, absolutely no one is experiencing MC as it is supposed to be. We have half a dozen major changes from vanilla that all make the content easier
---
Self entitlement, you millennial by any chance?
---
We lost another one boys!
---
Is this in whitemane? Shamyshamy is on my F list lol
---
100g an hour? LOL okay man.
---
Just get some real life EXP and lvl up bruh
---
well the old stats are all completely known, we used them on private servers. they could have implemented them easily
---
I’m doing it for the purple dagger.
---
I think it was on a UBRS run in vanilla some player I didn't know started trash talking the party members to me in whisper for some reason. The group was going pretty smoothly as well, only some very minor mistakes that hadn't caused any issues.
---
It got a bit tiresome so after a while I said in party chat "oh this guy is saying stuff about you" and he immediately proceeds to tell the group I was saying all of that and then puts me on ignore.
---
Pvp always pvp
---
That's OK when it is first person, because people talk like that.
---
I’m still level 25!? Lol ty blizzard I love you!!!
---
LOL
---
wrote out an entire letter for some trash loot. probs alliance
---
The point I’m trying to make is that we are more effective than we were as a community back then. Also, the current patch makes everything quicker to kill, including quests. 
---
I personally don’t think Dire Maul is a bad thing to release this early. It’s going to give the people grinding gear hard more access to gear, and people who follow up until Phase 3 access to variety in gearing options once they max.
---
True twinks dont want "nearly as good"

Check out the woweconomy subreddit

I love questie!

I use it because it saves me soooooo much time. I’m navigationally challenged.
---
Pft that's nothing. Our group got 2 HoJs on back to back kills.
---
I didn't ninja it or anything lol, guild said i could roll on it. 
---
I didn't think this was taboo, im a caster dps after all.
---
Also buy healing potions in bulk off the AH ("store" them in the mailbox), chugging down a cheap healing potion is much better than a corpse run. And the low level potions are REALLY cheap because of alchemists making them to level and because some classes don't really need healing potions and just sell them (like healer classes are usually better off snarfing a mana potion).
---
Yea shit like mask of the unforgiven or w/e from strath until you can get lionheart
---
F
---
overall if you intend to alt now is the time to buy buy buy. get the wands for your casters, the melee weapons for you warriors and rogues, get your fiery enchanted white item. buy a ton of cheap blues and just stock there banks with the gap removers.
---
one simple thing you can do right now is just geting the dungeon set parts that are BoE for the 50s they are dirt cheap and they are honestly a nice speed boost without having to bother doing dungeons right away.
---
At least I think it's the final one. I mean the one from the end of the War Campaign.
---
What a shocker, they are hemorrhaging subs more than expected after the first month and now they are staggering content to keep people, defeating the whole purpose of classic to begin with.
---
Does HOJ work on feral druids?
---
Pls no more
---
Not his that is
---
I've heard that the Alliance quests/zones are much better fleshed out because the developers started there, and were running out of time by the point they were doing Horde quests/zones.
---
I've got no idea if it's true, but it would definitely explain why a lot of the Alliance environments and quests feel a lot better. I loved playing horde, but I got really sick of undead crypts or barren wastelands for the first 25~ levels.
---
Well now it just seems like they misunderstood and thought it was a mis click which they are right isn’t their fault and shouldn’t do anything about. Then it seems he realized it wasn’t a mis click and then did something about it and fixed the issue . Seems like pretty solid customer support to me I don’t see the problem here. Maybe I’m wrong but that’s what I’m getting from this.
---
so i just did that, of the 50 allotted into the query, 28 are 60, 11 between 50-60, rest at various stages of leveling. This also includes possible bank alts and alts in general. This is not a source on "most people are around X lvl"
---
 Most people will probably never be 60 due to many quiting before lvl 20.
---
But crusader is worth it's weight in gold. That 100hp and strenght proc is a low level prot Warrior wet dream.
---
I'd like to see an orc do this. Get all the way to 59 without ever stepping foot inside your own capital, and then become a level 60 god as soon as you enter. It would be pretty zug.
---
I’m surprised they didn’t wait until actual Phase 2. My main characters, a hunter and warlock aren’t even level 30 yet but I’m not worried. In fact I’m happy that I’ll be able to prepare and start saving for my warlock epic mount quest as soon as he gets to 60.
---
DM won’t make other dungeons irrelevant outside of gold farming though. Also, Dire Maul was released about a month after Vanilla released in EU, so this timeline isn’t some absurd thing.
---
Slowest weapon with highest top damage in mainhand.
---
Faster weapon in offhand.
---
Just did. 25 60's, 15 50-59's, 5 40-49's, 5 &lt;40.
---
Most who are still playing are 50-60. Most characters made are 30 and under.
---
I can generally only play a couple hours a day max. It's very enjoyable. I'm never going to be on the front end of progression, but I fully expect to be raiding with my guild in the next month. If you stop caring what other people are doing, it's going to be more enjoyable to play.
---
Do the same with a white staff +30 spellpower
---
Ppl are hating on mages who instantly uses aoe spells. (In my experience).  
---
Also the mages who refuse to run a dungeon normally (not spellcleave)  
---
If you want to be extra nice, when you and the groups meet up at the dungeon, give out feee water to all mana users (especially the healer) before they ask.
---
That's retail
---
You gotta get your healers heart beating somehow.
---
You say, "They should give people a chance to try MC and Ony without DM Gear!"
---
I say, "It's already a joke without it."
---
You say, "And yet people still die to deep breath!"
---
and then say to me one post later,
---
"Nice straw man."

LMAO

You can enjoy the upvotes and seeing me downvoted for pushing against the communal crybaby momentum but I hope you're aware of how stupid you sound. I prefer to base arguments on logical merit instead of Reddit Debate Expertise.

🤦‍♀️ please don't yell at your family if you're frustrated at a game 🤦‍♀️
---
I agree. If they didn't want to be bored they shouldn't have rushed past all of the content.
---
Uninstalled and Reinstalled fixed the issue for me. Now I just gotta wait out the 2k que lol 😂
---
Because we alliance have honor. We are teaching you savages.
---
I helped a dwarf hunter once when he pulled too much. There were lots of hordies around so I didnt want him to die more than he had already (potentially.)
---
He sent me a wave. I waved back. Later he saved me. Twice. I did a /ty and waved again.
---
Finally saw him pull like 4 mobs. I faerie fired each as well as helped him kill 2 then left as I was already done the quest previously. He waved as I left.
---
Good things can happen too when you're nice.
---
Tbh I did this after earlier I saw a different dwarf hunter barely escape a mob. His pet dead already. I rooted him and watched as the troll NPC smacked him to death. Got a good laugh.
---
Felt bad so I helped the next dwarf hunter I met lol
---
Side note. My favourite way to kill alliance is to root them underwater after I know they've been down awhile. Always fun to see them rush up. And die.
---
Come to think of it. Most of my pvp encounters revolve around entangling roots. It's like our druids mind control haha. So fun
---
The gear progression is already fucked, no one needs those items.
---
I\`ve seen some variants of Drizzt and at least one Zacknafein.
---
Exactly.  Bizarre to see a community lump anyone who isn't playing 6 hours a day together as casual.
---
Oh good lord please tell me how we have classic wow otherwise.
---
I literally already answered this. It has a massive effect on people who are only level 30, assuming they intend to keep playing.
---
This pisses me off. I spend every free moment on this game and I’m not even close to 60. Who are all these people demanding more content already. Streamers? There aren’t that many 60s atm. Why rush content releases?
---
Lol you’re still wrong, Frost is farming ZF GY making like 50 gph that way. And their are already tons of hunters and warlocks running princess making about that an hour too. 
---
The people who want to make insane amounts of gold will, let’s not base content releases based on like .00001% of the players
---
No worries, just level at your own pace.  My first ever level 60 was after world bosses were released.
---
I do not mean the people who will take 6 months to hit 60 when I mean slower players, I mean high level 40’s/ low level 50’s. There are still plenty of things to do at 60 regardless, such as farm MC and Ony, hunt down your tier 0 gear, grind rep, train professions, farm for rare recipes, make friends and chill with guildies.  Hell, you can even make an alt. 
---
Dire maul can be delayed for another month and the gear from it will still be relevent to you. There are 40 people in a raid, there is no way everyone is going to get a piece of gear every week. Some piece of DM gear are even better than current raid gear. Meanwhile, if it is rushed out, several pieces of content lose significance for those who are not quite ready. BRD gear loses some relevance, for example.
---
It’s not about punishing people for rushing. Rushing ahead comes with upsides and downsides. You get to experience content before others, but have to wait a little longer for new stuff. This is about people who aren’t rushing ahead missing out on an experience they shouldn’t have had to rush towards.
---
Also, I’m 60 and have cleared the raid content. I’m not just angry at people for being faster than me. I truly think this sets an unhealthy precedent for the game. Classic has enough content to keep it going for a year to a year and a half, and will likely persist after it runs out for a time simply due to how good it is. I don’t see any reason to rush so hastily towards the end like this.
---
By who's definition?
---
Man this Bishi guy is a new kind of stupid.
---
Bro the game has been out for 6 weeks. Asking people to wait for you at your 3h/week pace is absurd. I don't know why you're commenting just to do some bizarre brag about how youre too busy.
---
Lastly, 6 weeks at 3 hours a week means you're rocking 18 hours played to be level 14, so at that pace you wouldn't even hit 60 before tbc was released if this was vanilla, so complaining about people at 60 getting content quicker doesn't affect you at ALL
---
This would all be fixed if hitting need just made the item soulbound
---
I'm expecting something at blizzcon
---
Haha hahah yeah!
---
It wouldn't surprise me if the girlfriend accounted for a large part of his social life which he doesn't have to worry about now lol. Probably a lot easier for him to only have to balance the game with work compared to work + a relationship.
---
I figured you had nothing more to say.
---
Is there any reason to be a holy priest before lvl 60?
---
I healed every dungeon in full shadow talents without any major problems. Even when I was 60.
---
Swtor died due to this exact reason. If they had of stayed on release content instead of forcing their hand for investors and catering to nerds they would’ve retained many more players and kept more invested. The hardcore want an audience so retaining the casual retains the hardcore. 
---
The business behind video games since their inception has been destroying good games. Just look at C&amp;C’s long history and how messed up and inconsistent their games were.
---
Blizzard made a name for themselves with patience and only releasing polished, good products, with a brilliant philosophy behind their decisions. Now days Blizzard doesn’t carry any weight as a name, and all of their franchises have taken a nosedive in consistency, philosophy, and business practises... except hearthstone:)
---
Source?
---
I love it for the story and Rexxar's voice lines, I think the actor did a great job, and Rexxar is just a damn cool character, half ogre, half orc and a companion who's a bear :)
---
Blizzard didn’t even need to make this game, stop being so entitled.
---
It's a copypasta from Path of Exile. If it started elsewhere then my bad, but I know it from PoE.
---
Don't pug so you're an ass to people in your guild. Wow.
---
We played gimmie da loot by biggie when we sropped him back then.
---
When we said no changes, we meant NO CHANGES!
---
Always interesting to keep hearing stuff like this parroted.
---
Probably a warrior who's salty that a druid can pull more threat as well as heal in the same run
---
mobs really LOVE to pop that ultra instinct right when they are about to die...so many fucking times 1 3% add wont fucking die and its like my bleeds are doing 1dmg.
---
Oh, we've already had the talk. We're on a routine schedule now. Everyone is happy.
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking the chest. Stop being a crybaby
---
Society.
---
I did this in retail with a voidelf named voidtits. Name got reported and was forced to change. Changed it to Voidtits. Name got reported again GM told me to change it. Named it Voidtaint. That really got the GM mad. Now it’s Voidtainted. 
---
I miss 2000’s Blizzard and nerd culture. No one would have given a single fuck that it was a female elf named voidtits.
---
Holy fuck dude calm down Jesus Christ
---
Re read my comment, where do I say people need to wait for me?
---
I'm going to guess people are down voting because of how you approach the conversation but I could be wrong.
---
I'm looking into drain tanking now. Seems I have to wait till I get my next demon but def will try this. Looks fun
---
Maybe easier to just acquire gold and buy it on AH. In other words, how long would it take you to wait for the pattern, and how much gold could you get in that amount of time?
---
What's so great about dire maul?
---
Items are the ilvl of one's from ubrs/strat/scholo.
---
Ahh.. right... You speak on behalf of society?
---
tl;dw
---
Bought this at 44 for my warrior main and boy was it a game changer for the rest of my levelling.
---
Reserving is perfectly fine.  Just don't group if you need a reserved item. I don't get Reddit's privileged "I DESERVE A GROUP AND THE LOOT I WANT EVEN THOUGH I'M A DIME A DOZEN DPS!"
---
Be in a guild that does runs.  Make friends that do runs.  Make your own runs.  Someone else can make their own rules as long as they do it ahead of time and people opt into those rules it's perfectly legit.
---
Quel Serrar?
---
Actually they undercut by 2.5%, not 1 copper. I don’t think it’s lazy to not want to spend 10 minutes doing mundane math to manually undercut, but to each their own.
---
Well probably because you're putting women on a pedestal rather than just viewing them as normal people too.
---
Yes your right, play time is actually probably double yours because I started on Faerlina with some friends before I realized it was the "streamer" server. Working 10am - 9:30pm 5 days a week with 3+ hours queue I would use Steam Link and keep myself from disconnecting. Finally said fuck that and started on Netherwind a week after launch. So easily have over 5 days ago "played" time on that character before I abandoned it to start new.
---
You've probably played every expansion since vanilla and know this game in and out better then your left hand. Me I quit after BC and didn't even raid in BC. I took the other side approach and started Horde Shaman. No fuckin clue where quests are because never played horde.
---
But then again all these people like you will probably burn out from rushing through classic to get 60 ASAP, BiS pre-raid and MC gear. That's cool cause I'll be here taking my time, enjoying the game like I'm on college again but without a bad drug habit.
---
&gt;I HAD ONE GUY WHISPER ME SAYING THEY NEEDED A BALANCE DRUID.
---
Found the pokemon collector.
---
Yo newsflash: 90% of diremaul's loot is shit just like every other dungeon.
---
No
---
The game has been out 42 days.  
---
I work full time and I'm level 53 with 7 days 14 hours played played.  
---
That's an average of 4 hours and 20 minutes a day.  
---
I'm basically no-lifing classic as much as I can and they're already about to release catch-up gear before I've even hit max level.  That's WAAAY too fast.  
---
Blizzard, if you're reading this, please *slow down*.  I want to enjoy classic.  Not feel like I'm constantly trying to keep up.
---
So.... You're saying there's a chance? Sweet!
---
We don’t have a drinking problem! You have a drinking problem!
---
Signed: a mage with a drinking problem
---
Spending 1k gold when you could just run a bit slower and eventually get it for free? Can't comprehend that, unless you've abused layering to make 1k in an hour. Even at 50g per hour that's 20 hours of hardcore grinding completely wasted.
---
Thank you I would’ve problly never ran the dungeon if it was released at a later date. Me and most of my guild are casuals and Mc and ony are finished and on speed run. Idk how the fuck people aren’t 60 i work full time have a family and a side job I’ve been 60 for a month and I enjoyed the fuck outta leveling did damn near every quest. I’m a fucking priest. People who are screaming about it being rushed want to sit at lvl 40 for fucking monthes. If you don’t wanna hit 60 than that’s ur fucking choice. If it was released in January I’d never touch it on my main I’m damn near full tier 1 and a piece of tier 2. Vanilla raiding was so slow to come out barely anyone touched Naxx don’t let it happen again please.
---
I can't wait for you to repost this in a few more hours.
---
Nothing like another mage video!
---
I'm 97 pct sure it's a hiccup in your connection to battlenet chat services
---
I believe he is saying he had no choice but to kill people 20 levels lower ( or being sarcastic and saying that's what you did) and when he is level 60 he is coming for you. 
---
  I could be wrong, I'm not drunk so my dribble chin isn't fluid.
---
Auctioneer will kind of do that. As you scan the AH over time it’ll show you how many of a given item it has seen, and the average price it went for
---
Then there's no point in having group loot.   Might as well have blizzard do personal loot in dungeons.
---
Yea but what if you're level 40 when that drops?
---
Lets say they release phase 2 at the 3 month mark. In 3 months the casual player is somewhere between level 40 and level 50. With the constant pvp going on in that time it will take 6 months for that person to level from 40 to 60.
---
I'd quit. 
---
IMO, they need to stall phase 2 pvp for awhile and drop BG's the same time.
---
This isn't 2006, there are tons of other games people can play besides wow, so signing on to get ganked 24/7 until BG's are released isn't really an option. People will walk away and play a different game.. In 2006 you put up with it because what other games were out there with as much depth as WoW? In 2019 that's not the case.
---
Do you need pathfinding (improved Aspect of the cheetah) to solo princess in Maraudon by kiting?
---
I quit at the end of BC too.
---
I understand it, for MMOs at least. I don't think I'd be able to play an MMO if I could only do it like 1-2 hours a day. Not being able to keep up with people or doing stuff like semi-hardcore raiding would be a turn off. 
---
But not only that, if you get used to playing a lot for many years it'd be so difficult to play a fraction of that. So, might as well just quit at that point instead of being frustrated.
---
As a healer i always thought this but no turns out were wrong &gt;.&gt;
---
I got my subscription a few weeks early for name reserve and whatever. Just wanted to log in. Spent some time messing around on retail. Got the left binding while solo'ing MC on my original main and the Baron mount on my alt. What the heck
---
Yeeeeah no not worse than how I’m a level 18 warrior being ganked by level 60 Horde rogues 3 days in a row now nonstop.
---
Honestly kinda starting to put me off the game. PvP is cool but this is just stupid :(
---
they are getting bored because they have streamer priviledges and are  getting everything handed to them and doesn't have to work for anything.
---
That is one of the names server blades from 2012. I paid just over $400. Some went for less. A couple went for over a grand.
---
ragnaros wasn't killed for 155 days after the inital release of the game though. its different. if blizzard paced the content the same as they did in actual vanilla the game would die.
---
Fuck I'm so far behind still
---
*cries in lvl 35*
---
You’re mistaking minimal gains with gigantic losses
---
Was questing with a hunter killing mobs, and he had to go afk for a bit. I decided to keep going while he was away, pulled a single mob and died. He came back and asked if I accidentally pulled too many at once. Nope...
---
they spit high-damage fireballs from half a map away, though.
---
Totally agree. I've been playing Classic with every free second I get, and I'm using a leveling guide, and I'm at level 51. I haven't had the chance to sniff BRD, LBRS, UBRS, Scholo, or Strat. I don't remember how much better DM gear is compared to those dungeons, but it really does weaken running the initial dungeons just because DM is the best to run most of the time.
---
I thought DM was a catch-up dungeon? Shouldn't it be released very late, like phase 4 or 5?
---
It takes a certain dedication to be this retarded. This sub makes me sad, all these bfa players that don't understand how the game works omg.
---
You know that wasting 40 seconds drinking mid dungeon so that 2 guys can have 300 extra mana is pure shit? AI is the most useless buff in dungeons.
---
Now stop browsing reddit and level a char to 60 to understand what's good or not in a 5 man dungeon. Have fun spending 2 hours to do scholo because you play with a prot warrior and wait for your mages to buff.
---
What? Like from the toilet?
---
No, that's probably not how it should work. 
---
Some guy paid $15 a month ago, played for 2 hours in the last 4 weeks and has the same say as me, who has enough hours invested to hit 60 in 2 weeks and has played multiple characters at various levels? 
---
I've created, and added to, gameplay experiences for hundreds if not thousands of people in the last 6 weeks. I've contributed way more to the community experience and the game as a whole than someone like that.
---
Every subscriber's opinion is not equal. This isn't an investor meeting.
---
TL;DW
---
\- A few Dire Maul items will replace raid gear which is lame.
---
\- Some boe's will plummet in price. Some people just bought boe's thinking they were bis for months.
---
\- The content is not needed at this point in time.
---
\- Not enough notice was given, thus loot has been improperly distributed / players have misallocated their time and gold.
---
i don't understand your point
---
feral druids can tank. having resources available prove that. if they couldn't there'd be nothing there. 
---
damn you are a dimwit.
---
If you’re too stupid to realize 2.5% being 1 copper in that situation maybe leave the selling to the people who didn’t fail 6th grade math.
---
I added one.
---
Couldn’t imagine the cry fest if this games economy was like path of exile
---
One dungeon with sub par drops won't break an old ass game..
---
It lets you summon the hydra boss which is a requirement for the carrot on a stick trinket quest
---
Ssssh no warse
---
Doesn’t count as a weapon
---
Weak
---
Good on you for finding something you love man! I admire the work you put into this!
---
It's true, Druids are incredibly handy to have on stealth runs.
---
I hid most of the interface but wanted to show off my gold lol
---
Yea, I feel you. Thing is though, that hardcore style of playing is actually really enjoyable too. I can understand why people would prefer to just quit the game instead of having to change their entire perception of it.
---
Repair didn’t work for me. I had to uninstall and reinstall. Luckily I have fiber internet with no data cap so wasn’t a big deal.
---
&gt; "We're going to release content in planned phases ... by the way we're going to break phases".
---
I've been playing 90% of evenings since a week after launch (changed servers 1 week in) levelling alongside my other half. Tonight we were going to start looking at the end-game dungeons like BRD and BRS as we approach 60 and start to assemble gear that I could look at and think "gee, that's a good item". Then this blog post comes along to tell us that we're too far behind other players and they already want to give us catch-up mechanics and simplify everything before we've even started.
---
Again, I've been playing most evenings for a few hours with that time being used to focus on duo-questing. No time-consuming professions, no gold-farming, no RPing and no alts. And even though we've played most evenings, Blizzard still considers us too slow because we weren't following "OPTIMAL QUEST ROUTES" from addons like Questie or Zygor nor were we submitting to dungeon AOE spam meta.
---
Instead, the economy is going to be inflated by the raw-gold-shitting machine that is Dire Maul before I can even engage with it. All my motivation to continue has been killed by Activision-Blizzard before even reaching 60 because playing ~4 hours a day simply isn't enough for them.
---
As for it catering to the 12+ hours a day-ers, why? One of the common complaints people have with retail is there is no time where your character is just "done" for a bit, you're always chasing something. This isn't how it was in vanilla or even the earlier expansions, why must it be a thing in Classic?
---
They've treated Dire Maul as a panic button to hit after the subscriptions of the transient one-month players ceased and 8.25's predictable failure to re-engage anybody. I'm appalled.
---
I disagree.
---
If you are not at least lvl 50 right now you are on the lowest end of the rope.
---
There is a considerable amount of enthusiastic players who took their vacation to get full nostalgic for 1 or even 2 weeks which are done with the content by now. Especially since everything is much easier then the original vanilla back then (1.12 greets)
---
I think this is a good decision. These enthusiastic players cared so much for classic that they made it possible for all of us. And you should keep these people occupied with content.
---
Currently lvl 44 war mobs are getting harder and we axe seems weaker. What's the next axe upgrade I should look for?
---
I understand, but disagree. I believe the lows are as important as the highs in this game. I think experiencing late game without DM before having access to it would make a difference towards many players appreciation of the content itself. However this particular line of thought is just a personal belief, and can see why some one would disagree.
---
It should. Key components of each class and a large reason for people choosing them. Pretty lame to gatekeep their epic mounts until the full P2 release.
---
No hunter is making 50g/hr, because you can’t solo rotgrip without kiting which are very slow kills. Killing princess and tinkerer is 35g an hour tops. Even if you are a lock and solo the 3 bosses 5 times an hour it STILL isn’t 50g, that’s the absolute high end. 
---
You’re literally talking about basing content release *earlier than planned* for the small group of people at 60 who want more content. 
---
And I said MOST people with 6k+ gold earned it through the AH, not all of them. 
---
Practice your reading comprehension or just continue talking out of your ass, it’s very entertaining.
---
I do the same for my pets.  My Broken Tooth is named Citchaccoh, after a Mayan god of war, Cit Chac Coh, a red puma.  I freaking love how well it fits.
---
they wanna cash in now while they have the numbers. this is just a $$$$ grab. they gonna blow their load quickly and then go to sleep after classic is done. they fucking up again.
---
Based on your comments you are saying that someone that lets somone on the other faction live is a carebare player that should play on a PvE server. Why must I kill every player just because its a pvp server?
---
What notice do you need for a mid 40s dungeon announcement
---
Case in point, I stay up till 3am playing knowing full well I have to be at work at 6am. No self control.
---
Its dx11/64bit now. Completely different engine. Closer to an entire new game than the original
---
So a true classic experience, sweet
---
Wow a video game company is acting...like a video game company. Just unsub homie
---
But it takes less time to just spell out Deadmines
---
And we shall reclaim it one day. Kings Honour.
---
Ah that makes sense then
---
Considering how crazy full most servers are still: Classic + might be already on the tables for blizzard if they are smart.
---
I play casually at work during downtime, started a couple weeks late, and am almost 60. I noticed when I passed the main pack of players back at around 35.   Things got really crowded and then thinned out slowly. Raids especially should be paced out so we don’t have people going up against AQ people in green and blues.
---
Buying and selling on the AH. It's pretty easy to do if you understand the prices, you just need the initial capital to start off.
---
Faster attack speed also benefits more from gift of arthas.
---
Yes, but as I linked it says it should be resetted when i enter instance, not resets, so its wrong =).
---
Mate, this isn't a race. And these people will stay occupied regardless. I'd much rather have longevity to the game than a race to Kel'Thuzzard that only 1% ever get to compete in.
---
My sister wouldn't run Drak'Tharon Keep when the spiders emoted something about "runs back to it's nest."
---
Honestly as a warlock I prefer the item mounts, shares no GCD with spells, uses no mana, doesn't ruin mana regen, ..
---
In high school I turned down an opportunity to hang with my girl so "I can go home and relax and play some video games" and she said "you'd rather play video games than hang out with me?" and I said "yes for today."
---
Dumped on the spot. It was the right move for us both.
---
All I see is 4 gold 34 Silver :)
---
I've seen that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kbymvOKMxY
---
I guess is it viable to have an entire group of rogues try to burst down the king in 15 seconds.
---
Sure. Just can't tank well. And still just the two
---
I see that Freezing Band. Nice humble brag
---
Harambe? 
---
Harambe.
---
wrong, tarnished elven rings from tribute, chest from fengus, shoulders/axe from north and MUCH more. 
---
Blizzard have rushed in.
---
Imagine considering yourself a serious player being level 40 and playing an hour a day. There is nothing wrong with that, those players have other priorities in life but that doesn't make them serious about the game.
---
I noticed a sword rogue had his faster/less damage sword in his main hand, so I kindly let him know he could be doing more damage if he swapped them.  Sure enough, when I sent another message to ask if he saw the first; Ignored.  Natural selection!
---
Gz, sold mine
---
It tracks wands correctly, but wands don't work like auto-shot, you can't weave in attacks without restarting your wanding.
---
&gt;He also said they felt like there was high demand for more content.
---
By who? Streamers who are desperate for things to stream because it's their income? What a fucking joke.
---
A little to the left if you wouldn't mind, brother warlock.
---
I see a constant stream of lvl 60's wearing most of their tier 1 sets while riding epic mounts. 
---
So while you may be right it also seems like there is a large group of people rapidly becoming epic'd out. Any chance of participating in phase 1-2 pvp without epic raid gear is already gone.
---
YEAH     LIVE      YEAH    WIN
---
Try dying?
---
It's too bad there isn't a fucking site where they release all this info. We have to go to fucking wowhead to find any info. Blizzard staying the joke that they are.
---
But maybe you guys are just rushing too much.   I feel like the average player should be around level 55 by now if they played a couple hours a day.
---
not really, its not worth loosing out on all the shadow damage while leveling.
---
For now.  Until untamed blade.  That is best in slot for arms a long time.
---
I looted one from a stv mistvale gorilla also
---
So your saying BFA players are clowns? I approve.
---
I like this idea. Tigerstrike Mantle is selling for only about 12g on my realm. Should appreciate in value quite nicely when all the twinking gets going.
---
You know that in vanilla the dire Maul patch was even earlier then this for Europeans right?
---
Are you me? I'm pretty much the same
---
"Hey, we just need 4 buzzard wings to make some hot wings"
---
cool, so I only need to kill two buzzards....
---
..47 buzzards later
---
"how these fuckers flying all round the place????"
---
Can you say 'projection'. Oh man I feel kinda bad for you tbh
---
Have you tried typing /canelaura Shadowform  or however its formatted in chat?
---
@assblast was it on Ashbringer EU?
---
No, it doesn't. People who are level 30 wont even be high enough to enter DM before phase 3 or something. lol.
---
The majority of players are still under 60, yes. But those at 60 are finding that the content is very limited, even if they’re raiding. Really I don’t think that’s the problem though; I think it more has to do with the fact that getting geared is quite difficult and time-consuming because most dungeons have dozens of bosses and it’s quite the commitment to do them.
---
There is loot specific to Dire Maul that’s extremely good quality for many people, and because it’s split into a few sections people can clear specific portions for specific loot items. It makes perfect sense for people wanting to get geared up but don’t want to commit to a very large, long dungeon (such as Strat, Scholo and BRD).
---
Dire Maul is also required for the Paladin and Warlock epic mount quest chains, so anyone playing those classes has probably felt a little frustrated that they’ll have to wait until full P2 release to complete those quests.
---
As a mage, you can farm 50g/hr min just by killing dogs and first boss in DM N. I farmed maybe 2-3 hours a week in there in my day, and easily got like 5 travelers bags and a shit ton of other goods AH recipes and blues every week. On top of that the dogs drop extremely lucrative vendor trash
---
True, but every class also has to repair and have other bills as well. 
---
Buff reagents cost money. Hunters literally pay money to attack. Druids have to pay to rez. etc... 
---
Tanks have the benefit of never having to wait to find a group, if they can't afford to be patient enough to wait for their healer then they can afford to pay extra for repairs.
---
how are you allowed to keep that name rofl
---
ITT: people aggressively mad that other people they don’t know have wiped to this boss
---
It took you 2 days to finally come back and call me ignorant and incorrect after you tried to win an argument by editing the patch notes to support your argument? 
---
Hahaha, brilliant. You're one of few people I've spoken to on Reddit with such an ability to blatantly dismiss the inconvenient and outright lie to convince yourself you've won an argument. Are you just shameless or you not even aware you're doing it, the level of dishonesty in your posting genuinely saddens and annoys me.
---
Ermagard I'm so blind, my glasses are even on.
---
But, now we talking!!! \*edit\* Congrats!!!!!!!
---
but a dagger with 30 sp is basically bis until raid
---
Deviate Delight would fit.
---
All keeper items in last bag! Makes selling crap easy since it all I. The first bag. Could use bag addon to make it one big one but I like seeing the individual bags
---
Is there no item that you spent a lot of time farming that you thought would be bis for months? For example briarwood reed for resto shaman?
---
Do you not know any player that bought an expensive boe that will now be lower in price?
---
I don't believe that these players made bad decisions, blizzard changed the timeline of when the dungeon was to come out.
---
2g? That's like 25 lvl 45 water or 12 mana bisquits. And I pay repair costs, too (yea I don't get hit that often so it's less, but it's not negligible). PLUS I buy candles to buff the group, with 2 buffs each rebuff (Spirit and Stam).
---
I'm sorry mate but the 55 water alone would cost more than 2g and that's not the end of my expenses. I also have a much harder time finding groups than you do while being a terrible solo farming spec.
---
DM: WF
---
My favorite thing about this article that you shared and did not read is that it literally says that bears couldn't tank at vanilla release
---
I would say about 2 hours a day is average and to be at about level 40
---
While this is kinda funny, no one likes a snitch.
---
Exactly what I needed! Thanks a ton.
---
Apparently they die very easily. 
---
Not sure about the damage, but for a few hundred gold investment I just wouldn't consider something with 1 minute uptime and 59 minutes downtime to be too amazing.
---
Died in an instance yesterday, came back and was still stuck in Shadowform. Ill do it out of an instance and see if it works. 
---
Edit: Dying outside of instance seems to work. ty!
---
Maybe you are thinking Mauradon? Dire Maul is 55+
---
/Cast shadowform? yes and no luck
---
QFT
---
Bring on the poopsock tears!
---
Im apart of the problem yeah but in all honesty it was fucked before I got involved on my server atleast. 
---
Greater fire protection pots are almost more money in the actual mats than what the potion goes for. Thorium is completely tanked in price and is worthless aswell as devilsaur armor being cheap as chips (70g/piece)  the only thing thats holding any value on my server is Dreamfoil and Mountain silversage which they hold around 7g-8g per stack. Im for sure not helping the problem but at this point I dont see the market recovering anyway.
---
Go below deck and use the rooms and hallways to break line of sight of the priest when they start casting on you.  Ez.  Mind control is a long cast so easy to dodge like that.
---
If you don't want to pvp why play on a pvp server?
---
That’s why I get that mage water baby
---
The lvl 40 quest mounts are in the game.  The epic versions are not.
---
Bruh I'm only level 23. And I'm busy with school, I might not come back if it continues like this
---
“Fellow seller.”
---
Or, as it’s commonly referred to, competition.
---
Azshara and Felwood. Winterspring quests lead to literally everywhere else in the world, some requiring flights to Ungoro, some trips to EPL, it's all over the place.
---
A month? Shit I was hoping (and still am) that it would cone in January.
---
Spell power is mostly completely wasted at level 1-20 because spells level 20 or below have reduced spell coefficient to compensate for lower cast times and mana cost.
---
Oh I didn't make that connection for done reason yes you are right
---
My mom is a grandma at 55, been a grandma since she was 50

Just hit 40. Enjoying my character yet I'm getting a massive urge to reroll or remake my character on horde side, as well as make too many ALTs.
---
How I wish I only liked 1 class and faction...
---
i played retail for like 2 weeks before classic came out (i only played wow from BC till early wrath back then). i went into Stratholme ONCE in my entire life (i am only lvl 44 in classic rn) and i got the mount.
---
But I don't get it...  The people who think are pushing the content through for faster (lvl 60s) are already in tier gear and don't need DM. 
---
Or is this about giving casuals a leg up into MC now that the rushing crowd have gone the harder way?
---
Yes, Whitemane. Unfortunately, this was not my first bad experience with the &lt;Alpha&gt; guild.
---
You're a fucking moron.  Get your learning disability diagnosed because something is wrong with you.
---
Isn’t that essentially BoP?
---
I am pretty sure there will be much more people able to clear naxx40 this time. Don't worry about that.
---
I would even go as far and say classic+ is already on the tables at blizzard right now considering the unbelievable success.
---
Anyone who does any sort of recreational type activity 4 hours per day is hardcore.  Working out, fishing, wood carving... doesn't really matter.  Not sure what youre so defensive about.  If you met someone and they told you they spent 4 hours a day putting puzzles together, i bet youd think they were pretty fucking into puzzles.
---
If something easily sells for 25s and you sell it for 22s how are you making “extra” money off it
---
my bet is that this IS the original date of P2 all at once, but they over-estimated how many people would quit and how much people would disperse, and this is now not on the table and wpvp needs a bit more time to stabilize.
---
For anyone wondering he's saying skinning dagger with fiery doesn't let you use any abilities that require a weapon. Meaning 90% or more of class abilities won't work.
---
No. Its for hardcore raiders. Unless your raid has 5 other engineers with it which stack flame buffet, 1 dragonling wont do much.
---
Na only if you need if you greed still BoE

No it was not. read it again.

Assblast I did help a horde once doing the quest in searing gorge to kill the elite with 2 elite guard and made sure he got the quest and the quest item next to him and i did get ganked when i was leaving the cave, if you are on Ashbringer EU then it must have been you, i was human warlock nazruth.
---
This would ensure people who need things are doing so to use it. For the most part
---
Are you on Kirtonos and was this last week?
---
I agree. I was a raider and everything way back in the day but I’m currently almost 47 and I’m just leveling a little more slowly than my friends who have already hit 60 or close do. Now I fear that in the few more weeks or month or so it’ll take me to hit 60 - people will have ran through so much and I’m coming in late.
---
I accidentally Ragnaros.
---
I'm not even to 60 yet. Now I'm two raids behind.
---
What happened to when the majority of players are 60? I can't be that far behind.
---
Some bosses are immune to bleeds, so no impale damage. Bosses only allow 14 debuffs, so you're either not getting impale up, thus a big damage loss for you, or your impale+MS are eating 2 debuff slots and gimping all of your mages and warlocks, just to improve your own dps by 10%
---
It’s cause when you attack them you damage the wing obviously... hit them with and axe... whoops crushed the wing... hit them with a shadow bolt corrupted the wing now all the meat is tainted can’t use that one ... or you need to sacrifice a goat to RNGesus like the rest of us
---
Yeah. At 42 that's the best I can do.
---
Dire Maul: world first?
---
I bought warden staff the last day I played classic and am welcoming update which has free sidegrade to it.
---
Generally it's cheaper to buy the mats yourself and make the items. But it depends on the prices of the materials. You'll have to do that research yourself though, because its entirely server dependent.
---
Good thing 1-20 is but a tiny fraction of 1-60 :)
---
What resolution do you play at? I tried elvui and it was a little too small, and Spartan is pretty okay but too bulky. your setup looks so great I'll give tuk a try
---
Lol when I played vanilla like 75% of people called it VC. It was VC then and I will always call it VC no matter what people call it now.
---
hmm [`https://gyazo.com/e82f7ff0b08de5580bd429893599f79b`](https://gyazo.com/e82f7ff0b08de5580bd429893599f79b)
---
&gt;If there were a healthy amount of people still playing the game they wouldn't have pushed out an update this soon. A lot of lvl 50-60 players are starting to drop off now as well because they are bored with nothing to do.
---
3 things are untrue about this statement.
---
I dunno that’s a walk of shame if I’ve ever seen one!
---
Can you explain this? What would detect magic said do to in this scenario
---
Scarlet monastery quest
---
dang is that a Ghoulfang?
---
Yes exactly, that's why it affects them considering Dire Maul will be out so soon, not in phase 3. How are you misunderstanding this?
---
Well said, the timing affects the experience.
---
 The strength and terror of the Great Worm were now great indeed, and Elves and Men withered before him; **BUT NOT ORCS**.
---
You leveled all the way to 60 without add-ons? That's a great feat.  Congrats.
---
And they can't get farming professions that make equal money. Staying tank spec and charging one of the orbs is incredibly fair since most of them pass on even greed blues.
---
Saw a Hunter take it =D
---
Ah I guess I got too excited and thought it was part of this phase. Either way the honor system is essentially a lot of content since so many will be farming. And you gain ranks based on your standing on the server so I’m not sure what you mean. You can hit rank 14 without battlegrounds
---
Bad thread. Furor gives 10 rage, enrage gives another 10 instantly if talented, and 10 over time either way. Pre-hotting before pulls allows you to generate incredible aoe rage. Combined with faerie fire threat on pulls &amp; demo roar to get a bit of threat on everything and druids are much better at tanking than anything else in dungeons.
---
No not at all, I'm perfectly pleasant to most people. Bringing amateur psychology to a conversation with a stranger that you've only exchanged a few words with is a good way to find yourself with a broken jaw, there is nothing douchier. Maybe you should ponder why you elicit this type of response from people. 
---
I don't get upset, and I'm not surprised when people block me, I know exactly why. And I never feel like I've lost something of value. I'm surprised that someone would say something with the express purpose of triggering someone, and then blocking them before they can see their reaction, which is what the original comment said. I was trying to rationalize it, you had to be a dick.

---
Cancelaura is different.
---
&gt; Is there no item that you spent a lot of time farming that you thought would be bis for months? For example briarwood reed for resto shaman?
---
Honestly, not really. I'm still wearing a green or two, and I've gotten MC epics. I'll happily replace the greens or MC epics if there are better items out there. 
---
The only thing I'm farming is the Magister's set, and that's only for nostalgia. I know it's completely useless in PvE. 
---
&gt;Do you not know any player that bought an expensive boe that will now be lower in price?
---
I do know that. But it has almost no impact on actual gameplay or the ability to have fun. 
---
&gt;I don't believe that these players made bad decisions, blizzard changed the timeline of when the dungeon was to come out.
---
For those that have bought items, and used them, they haven't made bad decisions at all. They are actively gaining benefits from the item and will for at least another week.
---
For players bulk buying these items, hoarding them, and expecting them to raise in value so that they can resell them at a later time, they made a bad decision.
---
BGs will add some things, like the ring from AB and weapons from AV. Dire Maul changes ~3 items on each class list.
---
i want fking ogre
---
It's not so much that I'm concerned about Dire Maul coming out now.  If that had been the plan from the beginning, that would've been fine.  It's that it's happening so suddenly and with little warning.  It changes the game so much.  I was hoping to pick up some of the BoE BiS pieces for tanking then focus on stockpiling Larval Acid and Essence of Water to sell later for players looking to craft Hide of the Wild.  That was supposed to help fund repairs, enchants, gear etc. going forward.  Prot warriors don't farm for shit, so I needed that speculation in order for my class choice to be economically viable.  If I had known DM was coming this fast, I would've leveled a mage first.  Instead, my mage is still level 20, as I've been dumping most of my time getting geared up for raids and organizing a weekly raid.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So for me, this feels like a huge betrayal.  They said the were going to do something and then reneged on it with almost no warning.  Which, yeah, I know, it's Blizzard, I shouldn't have taken them at their word, but I'm dumb and thought that they were trustworthy on this one...
---
Nah what he needs to do is cough up and pay for five accounts because no sane human being is going to run a group for another person so they can get one of the rarest mounts in the game.
---
I'd prefer to keep pulling without mana breaks as much as possible, but when it's time for a mana break I'm going to let everybody fill up.
---
I don't go to the gas station and leave after buying $2.37 in gas, why would I waste water to fill up 15% of healer/dps mana?
---
do not talking me again so fuking idiot
---
I promised myself to abstain in order to make the experience closer to original. Now I just want to reduce confusion and tedium
---
If you're only lvl 23 probably doesn't matter if it comes out next week or next month lol
---
Well i know what i'm doing.
---
Good lord this group i've been running with has so many shamans, myself included, holy hell the chain heals, its just a fucking meme at this point.
---
Alot of private servers actually let it slide for a few weeks because it was a vanilla thing, then nerfed it because it's broken as fuck.
---
What is your money management secret besides not buying unnecessary abilities?
---
It's Cookies Cavern
---
So letting one player live is enough for you to want that person to go to a PvE server? It makes no sense.
---
Very well, my original counterpoint was not well put forward, and I can see how it was abrasive. 
---
After raiding, I can agree that the current raid mechanics are trivial. That does not mean there is no learning curve. Better gear would lessen the learning curve, and the there is a possibility that there are people who would struggle much more without DM gear are still levelling and have yet to experience it. I believe they have a right to fail before DM is released, provided they do not take a very long time to get there. I have no statistics to show these people exist, though no one has any statistics, so all we have is speculation, and I speculate that the number of these people is not insignificant.
---
If you think some one’s counterpoint is shallow, I believe that you should explain why. Responding with a straw man has done nothing but result in this pointless argument that could have been avoided had you responded with “doing things wrong is not the same as something being easy”, or anything along those lines. Had you called me out for being dismissive, I would have even apologised. Instead you insulted me.
---
I’m not always successful at treating people with respect and get careless, but I firmly believe that you should treat others with respect. Insulting some one for being stupid is unproductive. Instead, try and get them to be smarter, at least the amount of stupid out there might go down. And if that doesn’t work, instead of bogging down the place with useless arguments, just stop responding. I have tried my best to reach something of an understanding with you, so I shall follow my own advice and stop responding now.
---
Bruh we got 4 HoJs and 2 Warden Staffs in on one mob bruh
---
I'm a big fan of the camaraderie between some of us in game, whether alliance or horde.
---
The number of people who are going to stop running MC because Dire Maul is out: ZERO
---
DM came out a month after launch on EU, stop your hysterical whining.
---
Only if you're sword spec. SS can procc the extra swing which resets the swing timer. You want to SS right after you auto attack so you don't waste it.
---
I think you replied to the wrong person? I'm not talking about how dry the content from phase 2 is. I'm saying the content is irrelevant. Releasing this early sets precedent to release other things early as well. This is a bad thing.
---
whats up with warriors asking for tanks for their 5 mans?  is this 2005?
---
Yes, if you are combat spec.
---
My understanding is that if you take the sword specialization in the combat tree (chance to get an extra attack), you want to use sinister strike right after you auto attack. This has something to do with how the talent resets the auto attack.
---
I could be butchering the reasoning, but better rogues than me have agreed this is optimal. They use the weapon swing timer for this.
---
Jesus, I haven't had a single issue like any of these things listed in this thread. My server has been nothing but great.
---
i believe you have to clear around and go in thru the actual door/gate instead of dropping down
---
That's pretty good.
---
Part of your pre raid bis, if you choose to get the 4 piece set bonus!
---
Congrats! I did the same thing ❤️
---
Holy shit this is quite possibly the wrongest, dumbest post I've seen. And there's been a LOT of them.
---
Healers are god without a doubt
---
My mount is in there! Can't be released too soon
---
I did like 20 SM cath runs and couldn't get hand of righteousness (19.xx% drop)
---
I’m 54 now and have even snuck in some morning time before I really start working for the day. Full time jobs are the worst.
---
Hunter preraid has 7 slots with DM gear and 6 from non-DM dungeons.  It's a pretty dramatic shift. I just got my second hatchet after tons of undead runs and Barb blade comes out next week? K.
---
Dropped off a bloodhound it looks like so chance is 0.0001% or 1 in a million.
---
I'm not sure I understand your question. Are you asking why some warriors like to DPS in dungeons?
---
As a rogue they’re ez, kick and gouge your way to victory
---
But why?
---
Because 1) it comes out more than twice as quickly as Dire Maul did back in Vanilla and 2) Most of the playerbase isn't even level 60 yet. This is only serving the hardcore players who dinged 60, cleared all the content and now have nothing to do.
---
On its own, this piece of news isnt bad. But if this is a sign of things to come, if Blizzard continuously releases things at a rapid rate, then what happens at Phase 6? If they keep up this quick phase cycle just to appease the 1% that is streamers and minmaxers, the longevity of Classic will be shooting itself in the foot.
---
If you can get Ravager from SM Armory it does crazy AOE damage. Many ppl use that for cleave parties until BRD.
---
Game came out 15 years ago and people have been playing on private vanilla servers since TBC came out. I dont think longevity is going to be an issue imo
---
And tank threat.
---
My main is a warlock and im currently leveling a mage alt, 45 so far pretty nice having a mage especially since its on a different account so can use both together
---
Get an addon to track mana ticks, and drink right before the tick. For safety you can stop and drink through the tick but you can do it while running with good timing.
---
But we are not fucking talking about release. 
---
confused much?
---
This is the "simple questions and answers" thread, not the "warlock phd thesis" thread. This is the place for spoonfeeding.
---
Blathfathom as in the dungeon? You should really let your tank pull. Most groups have no issues with BFD, so unfortunately, the problem is likely you.
---
Well.... funny part of this is if he were to have your named banned it would be added to the list of names that you cant choose. So he wouldnt get it even after. 
---
What an entitled little prick
---
See if this helps 
---
https://youtu.be/bY5ChVDRLus
---
shamans' can tank (as this was originally about dungeons)
---
just not in raids
---
Your mum gay, its objectively true. I decided that so it must be true
---
Yep! It has its problems of course but I think that “class fantasy” hit its perfect stride for MoP. So many classes and specs were at their peak design wise. Destro lock though? My god.. we finally got green fire and they topped it off with the best offensive caster spec of all time. Fel flame and moving incinerate are dearly missed.
---
You are normal.
---
i said i’m a healer so yes i am a warrior
---
ThTs what I get for not doing the math, but the point remains.
---
so phase 3 in December?
---
My personal best is FOUR alliance thrown off the boat on a single trip from Booty Bay to Ratchet.  
---
The smarter ones just Los me though, It's a long cast and there is plenty of ways to break LOS on that boat.
---
Projection
---
Because then you wouldn't be a true gent \*\*tips fedora\*\*
---
No, the reason you put it on a white is so **multiple alts** can use it. Putting it on a blue or green item, means only a single alt can use an expensive enchant. 0-20 is neither here nor there. Using it on a Mage, Warlock, Priest, and maybe Druid is the real value.
---
what chat addon is that?
---
Yep, scumbag 60 Shaman named John. He was also seen (with a rogue) camping the boat, which I guess isn't illegal but is certainly a dick move and using Rogue's ability to make people run into the water so he can jump down there to kill them because he can stand on water.
---
He was using some disguise to make his char model look human.
---
DM is a pretty big deal for a number of reasons, namely the gold farming potential for hunters and mages. 
---
You'll likely see a sharp increase in cost of commodities, as layering will soon be removed. Large servers will be competing for open world resources and soon, honor.
---
It's more than just a catch-up dungeon, it's the primary gold generating source for players from here until the end of classic.
---
Also don't forget warlock epic mount quest is in there
---
What do you mean super stingy lol, sounds like he was just joking around with you. Did you expect him to actually hold the boat or give you money?
---
Couldn't agree more
---
You're crazy, alot of my friend group has alrdy considered quitting till phase 2 there is nothing to do at 60 its boring
---
I understand you just fine. Its just that your points are trash. However seeing as you cannot further your case without pathetic insults to my intelligence I will be leaving it there. You are clearly not worth my time.
---
Who gives a FUCK about the "average joe?" It's a fucking video game dude. This isn't Walmart vs Mom and Pop here buddy.
---
But I'm still correct, stating that UBRS somehow becomes "mostly redundant" is fucking stupid.
---
Maybe waste your efforts calling out the people spewing bullshit in non-stop these comments rather than crying about my tone.
---
Who hurt you
---
Youre right blizzard don't have to do anything, but they will if it's worth their while, if a problem is common and not isolated they'll feel more inclined to fix it. How can you discover if it's a exception  to the rule or the rule it self? You find out if others have the same issue by asking them. Then  blizzard can make up there mind on how they want to handle it.
---
I remember back when Dark Souls 3 came out my gf dumped me like a few days before so that weekend I got to stay in and play for 12 hours straight. It was glorious.
---
#showtooltip

/cast [mod:shift] Flamestrike; Blizzard
---
Regular one doesn't cost mana, can't be interrupted and doesn't lock us out of shadow school in PVP. No regrets.
---
55-60 is diremaul.
---
Also BIS or pre-BIS is a HUGE AMOUNT OF SHIT.
---
Classic is never designed for casuals. If you don’t have more than 3 hrs a day to play, you certainly can’t do anything. And that 3 hr is barely enough for a dungeon run. To farm BIS and enjoy end game, classic is like a part time job.
---
So what happens if we fall behind? Are we fucked or will be still be able to find groups ?
---
What? Who the hell else do you think they are appeasing then?
---
I prefer to use latex gloves
---
I am sitting at level 29 right now.  I am not even playing other games at the moment.  Just don't have the time.
---
I was hoping to get the classic experience since I missed out the first time.
---
I wonder about that too. All throughout my 50s if I did a /who at my level I would find like 30 people online, but if I did a /who 60 there was always 50+. I just hit 60 the other day too and I play a fair bit but still not as frequently or with as much focus as a more hardcore player. Most of my friends who have full time jobs and other responsibilities are in their 50s as well. There are more 60s than people realize right now, I'd say.
---
This is mistake and the lack of communication is concerning. It's like they assumed people would be excited instead of confused.

Originally DM came out before *anyone* cleared rag.  So I'm not sure why this matters
---
Chaotic Retarded.
---
Zugjugs made me giggle
---
I suspect the idea is that people who are losing interest or already quit Classic will be re-invigorated by the introduction of Battlegrounds.
---
RemindMe! 8 hours

Same with lock. Ten seconds of not being able to death coil or fear means you're fucked.

A bop trinket that gives fear immunity

I remember that night. I was shitposting on 4chan when it leaked

I need to get better at this. im just so used to mashing that key to burn the rage i use it all up
---
This is perfectly fine. When something sells like hot cakes at a good steady price and then some "businessmen" undercut it by 300% and dump price so far it's lower then vendor price for days it becomes infuriating.
---
Do runs, if loot drops and it looks better, roll for it. If you win it, equip it.
---
I have seen people pass up on some good upgrades because they aren't on the BiS lists. What's odd, is they are often not running with the specific talent builds or groups those BiS lists are based around.
---
Following BiS will be the gearscore mentality, where if you don't have all BiS according to someone else you won't get invited to runs because you won't be "geared enough" even if what you are running is something that doesn't require anything close to that level of gear.
---
Hillsbrad for a couple of levels, they have super easy quests there that isn't too much running, especially compared to the barrens.
---
Then go to 1k needles and then Desolace next.
---
It would probably be better to use modifiers to select which marker you want to place. For instance skull by default, hold alt to mark cross, hold control to mark circle, etc
---
My Enh friend had one shotted skulls with this weapon. Always a great laugh
---
No dark runes on the AH?
---
The Ring from tribute and the belt for dagger rogues.
---
Everything will still be fine. There are lots of people playing to accomodate all levels of dedication and the turbo nerds are making alts that can help fill groups with the slower levelers.
---
It literally does not matter. People are having some weird anxiety for some reason. DM doesn't make any dungeon irrelevant except arguably Maraudon and I think everyone can agree that a 60 going back to kill Princess in a group full of 45-50s for a ring because there literally isn't a better one anywhere else in the game is fucking stupid.
---
Back in 2005 dire maul was released a month prior to the first ever ragnaros kill. In theory dire maul is "late" in comparison. 
---
It isn't going to change or effect much coming out other than more content for the dungeon grind leveling crowd
---
&gt;Ausgrabungszentrum
---
I think your mini-map sneezed.
---
No, not releasing a single scrap of new content from August 27th 2019 through to February 2020 would absolutely kill Classic WoW. 
---
But hey, at least that would somehow be "fair" to the people in this thread who only play 2 hours a week. Who cares if they'll quit soon after because there'd be nobody left to do dungeons with.
---
I use the quest objectives, but I think the best feature of questie is showing where to pick up relevant quests.
---
I joined a casual guild and I’m having fun. I haven’t even hit 40 yet. It was a guild just tossing invites to anyone who wanted one, so I knew I was joining a zerg guild. Surprisingly, most of the guild seems pretty chill and fun to hang out with.
---
We occasionally get some gung-ho hardcore types, but they usually find a better fit with a raiding guild and move on with no hard feelings. 
---
Surprisingly, we had our first MC raid yesterday.

Whaere can I find this "Blacklist" anyway? Apparently I'm on it for accidentally pulling aggro on one extra mob on accident that didn't even wipe us...
---
Lol what? I bet they haven't even considered that game just like most other people. Literally never heard of it
---
The true big brain move
---
It's already like that in STV =/
---
Waste of rage for dps as time saved = efficiency in leveling. You want to focus on killing 2 mobs rather than one, mortal strike doesnt have much purpose in that.
---
Yep found that out the hard way when I thought I'd save a bag slot by equipping it to my main hand on my hunter.
---
Quel’Serrar!!!!!
---
The water elementals in thousand needles that put that 52% chance to miss debuff on ya
---
Fuck whoever made that debuff
---
How do I enable this feature? Is it an addon?
---
you do realise the serves still feel full because layers are being removed right? A full server with long ques started at like 5 layers and is now down to 1-2 without a que... thats a huge drop off
---
LOL ok thank you.. you calmed MY anxiety
---
Reminds me of “Here comes the pain bitch”
---

---
I mean I don't really care how I come off to random people on the internet,but if he wasn't saying people should wait for him, then he commented literally for people feel bad about him having no time. Stupid regardless imo
---
But you get the prestige of having attended, that's worth more that money or loot.
---
If you clear into the room rather than jumping down, it's possible to reset. But no one ever does that, so if you wipe or bug it out, then it's a full instance reset.
---
Yet another case of "going too fast slows you down"
---
Like, a lot of mobs between 1-60
---
I use it. But when someone lists 100+ copper ore like that it still gets annoying.
---
You can prob make a mouseover macro for it
---
It makes absolutely no difference where the realm is "located." Even their own data centers aren't consistent. The only way you'd even know is the realm time, which doesn't map to much.
---
Sounds fun. I tried to go to Ashenvale and I got lost. Had to hearth out and abandon all the quests Lmaoo
---
You can take a look at my profile for more chars, all my names are puns/based on race.
---
it's not viable like it was in vanilla.
---
I have and still have several wow accounts. in vanilla I was able to powerlevel a druid just before naxx dropped by having the druid tag with moonfire, then the lock would kill it. the druid got full kill xp.
---
in classic you get xp based on damage done with a penalty for level difference even out of group. it no longer works.
---
you are also heavily penalized for kill xp in a duo. about 38% of the xp for a single kill that you would have gotten alone vanishes when in a duo. example was lunch day. I was two boxing hunter and shaman. when grouped a level 9 boar was 22 xp each. when ungrouped the hunter got 63 xp. 
---
since most of your leveling xp comes from kills this was annoying.
---
ehhh im not going back to retail
---
**EU Alliance**: I'm looking for leveling groups that can increasingly do combat continuously (with no mana breaks). I'm especially looking for the Forte Burning Crusade diaspora, and the Exiles of Fate and Zenedar vanilla diaspora. I have a level 31 character on **Gehennas**, a level 27 on **Razorgore**, and level 25s on **Firemaw**, **Golemagg**, and **Shazzrah**, all EU Alliance healers, all named 'Egel'.
---
There seems to be no concerted effort from Forte players. The Zenedar diaspora has congregated on Razorgore; I'm foremost looking for a leveling group there, and especially for a good and aggressive tank.
---
&gt;With Classic, I‘m playing a shit ton since release (around 23-24 days /played now)
---
Uh...it's only been out for 42 days. Minus 14 for 8 hours sleep per night leaves 28 days. More than 80% of your waking hours have been spent on wow...
---
Hey that's on Zandalar tribe EU! I was inspecting that guy yesterday because he had a nice tabard haha, small world
---
Better than mine. Dinged 1 mob later than the priest I've been leveling with on a flame elemental in BRD. The first one once you go through shadowforge gate.
---
It doesn’t cause it doesn’t tell you about important quest lines which addons like Zygor show you.
---
Gatorbite from Mara
---
My mage names Phrostitute got renamed at lvl 20 :(
---
lol yeah just got killed by a mage there right before posting this
---
Amazing world PvP as in you getting swarmed by a raid of people just running through zones? Yeah, sounds pretty epic to me!
---
Sure, the "streamer" servers will have "epic" events and such, where followers of each streamers will face up against eachother and blablabla, but that doesn't really make it "amazing" in any part, just that it's gonna be one hell of a lag fest.
---
I REALLY feel that WPvP is looked through SUCH rose tinted glasses it's not even real. It was cool back in 2004-07 when noone knew what to do, and WPvP usually meant even fights or the occasional 1vX with a you having better odds cus of not only skill but level advantages etc. But that epicness isn't really there anymore in 2019, vanilla IS already "discovered" in that sense. There is always a answer to every situation, the only thing that makes it epic is the showcasers, in this case that would be the streamers.
---
Sure, HKs coming out with P2 and NOT bgs would prolly SOUND epic and all that, but it would be literal hell to play. You'd be killed EVERYWHERE if you weren't in a 40man raid, and chances are, even then you'd die, and damn if you did, the opposing faction would NEVER let you go until you either spirit ress OR ress run into the actual raid. And that isn't fun, except for the opposing faction, and even that would prolly get boring pretty fast.
---
no flying
---
This. I'm tired of people talking without knowing shit. Ty for spreading this here sir.
---
What is the point of AH taking anything? I can kind of understand the deposit as it helps keep people with no money from flooding AH with items and makes you consider if it is worth it to put up. But taking a cut of any kind is pointless as it is not run by anyone who plays the game. It would make more sense if you could buy stock in the auction house and make dividends off of the 5% they take from all auctions or something like that.
---
I get the odd death here and there by alliance as I go outside to help a warlock summon. But probably not as bad as you're describing. I'm level 48 and so haven't been to any of the endgame hot spots yet. I did feel sorry for alliance trying to run SM, a lot of corpses out the front of the instance portals there
---
The quest mount isn't free. I think I did the math and on my server the mats are around 750g, so only a bit cheaper than the regular one.
---
It was common in vanilla as well
---
My stoned ass was definitely thinking maras level range but ultimately my sentiment stays the same as rag is already dead and the current content is on farm - it allows no advantage
---
What happens in reality: Blizzard announces BC Servers and I get hyped
---
What happens in /r/classicwow dream world: Activision allows blizzard to spend dev time making new content for classic wow without any additional monetization besides the subscription fee
---
6 months is still way too short though, more like a year and a half imo
---
Shit! Now I gotta re-roll my gnome. I thought mage was just a good fit. Should I go with a rogue?
---
yes
---
Wasnt that a TBC invention... maybe?
---
curtail
---
reduce in extent or quantity; impose a restriction on.
---
I'm a tank, and there's no chance I'm waiting an extra 5-10 seconds for healers to go from 60-70% mana to full..for 1 trash pack or for a boss.
---
I would do runs with a priest last night who would top everyone up, then Start drinking, then move to the next fight.  That's like a minute of downtime between packs.  He wasn't even dipping below 40% mana, just refused to heal unless fight started when he was 100%
---
On my server its lvl 60 alliance stopping horde from princess runs.
---
Kinda interesting strategy.
---
Resource denial.

and when I press on the macro nothing happens
---
Gnarly, thanks.
---
Yes,  they’re amazing
---
Finally 55 water and rip to all the locks pallys that wasted 1k gold thinking this was gonna be in december or something
---
Yeah. I couldn't name a guild because it had the word "hot" in it.
---
"Hot."
---
This is like literally the \#1 thing you can do to speed up leveling.
---
lmao at people grinding for xbow in LBRS.
---
How is this relevant to the post at all?
---
those servers will just get forced login ques like the good ole days... blizz gonna push them to 1 layer and say should have taken the free transfer to our dead server m8 good luck
---
It's not about this one dungeon, it's about them saying they're feeling a lot of pressure to speed up releases and a huge number of people are gunna get to 60 and be competing against Naxx geared no-lifers feeling like they'll never catch up.
---
I had super lucky runs yesterday in Stratholme, 5 BoEs Tier 0 wrists and sword + 2 truefaith recipes and the epic sword from Baron and this was like 3 runs. Today the Dwarf epic gun dropped. Stratholme is the shit
---
I'm constantly surprised that classic is somehow populated by people who loved vanilla but st the same time they haven't matured at all. I'm turning 30 soon and I imagine there are a fair amount of people even older, yet I still see the same petty, rude and shitty people that ruined the community in retail...
---
Lol?
---
They have some of the most unique abilities in the game and can kite extremely well.
---
Warriors is a pretty simple class to play.
---
Not a chance imo. I don't think money men will allow them to put dev time needed for classic+ without also putting in more monetization, which they know the player base would freak out over.
---
Much more likely that they'll announce BC servers. Hell some mad bastards even want wrath servers
---
No. That was Phase 2 . Will probably be around with PvP honor system
---
I don't know for sure. Maybe the argent Dawn enchants won't be available for a phase or two. But I would still recommend working on other rep grinds so that when the enchants drop you're ready.
---
Good point, locks and palis get their sexy mounts
---
Maybe they just feel this is the correct time for phase 2? They are the ones with all the information. The speculation on reddit is exactly that, speculation. 
---
Why would they cater to streamers? The streamers are a small drop in the bucket of subs. What makes you think blizzard would cater to anyone other than the majority of paying customers?
---
Yea, I understand ganking but exploiting geometry to avoid guards is pretty scumbag, hope they get a vacation from the game
---
Some people tend to sell stuff like gyrochronatoms for example and sell them lower then raw mat costs/vendor price for days for some bizarre reason. Demand is high enough - they sell fast for 40-60s a piece but then some "buy high sell low" market expert begins to dump the price to 10-19s and doesn't stop for couple of days.
---
MC was patched in before most people hit 60.  But it wasn't a dayone patch from what I remember
---
i think its literally called weapon swing timer, if you only go into melee distance when your weapon swing is ready, can reduce damage on you by over 50%
---
Sounds like a whore who wanted an out anyways.
---
Yeah I had a good group that we did with me starting at collect 20 eyes quest. I’m also a mage, so the travel time was decreased as I ported everyone to where we needed to go.
---
Still took about 4 hours of straight running around. So much back and forth. Seriously, fuck that quest line.
---
{x} works as well dont need to type out cross
---
Really? That's nice, and wanted.
---
Hope the zookeeper were at least able to extract the sinew, cause I certainly wasn’t...
---
I don't like this idea, but I do wish we'd have to que at the portals in there respective zones. Could make for some interesting world pvp while que waiting.
---
No daggers, no ambush, no fun
---
Sure buddy. You go play one and see how many blizzards are started before you even maul your second mob.
---
more like 5%. Westfall is a very populated server and there's a total of 4 MC groups running right now server wide. there's been a few pugs that kicked tires but there's just not enough geared people yet.
---
\&gt; If classic, on a fucking 4-month phase release cycle is going 'too fast' for you, you're not playing the game. I have a full time, 9-5 job (I took off the first week, however was stuck in queue for 1/2 of my scheduled playtime) and my fucking ALT is level 55. 
---
Man I'm not trying to come at you, but if you're trying to pretend you don't play \*a lot\* with nearly two 60's in under two months you're nuts dude.  It's very easy to be 60 at this point if WoW is the primary thing you do with your free time.  It's a serious reach to tell people they "aren't really playing at all" if they haven't hit 60.
---
The game released 42 days ago.  I think 5-10 days played tends to be the agreed upon spread for leveling to 60 "fast" vs "normally".  We're looking at about from 3-6 hours \*per day\* of playtime to be 60 at those speeds.  That's hardly the bar for "even playing the game at all."  3 hours a day is a hefty chunk of time for somebody with anything else going on in their life.
---
To say that anybody who can't dedicate over 20 hours a week to the game "doesn't get a say" in endgame content is laughable.  Raiding at 60 right now is like a 5 hour a week investment, if that.  Hitting 60 is the lengthy part.
---
Pre raid BiS is also a joke and I can't fathom why people are so obsessed with it both on this subreddit and in game.  Gear is irrelevant to successful raiding before phase 3, and even the few BWL gear checks are pretty shallow.  Gear is also very unlikely to go to waste in guild raids for many weeks to come.  If you join late, you'll just be grabbing all the gear going to nobody.  Sure, you're probably not going to get a BRE or perditions unless your guild happens to see a lot of them, but \*somebody\* in your guild is getting them and that's helping \*you\* progress through the later raids where you \*will\* be picking up the new loot.
---
If you hit 60 in phase 5...yeah you maybe kinda missed the boat for being "bleeding edge".  phase 2? lmao, that's absurd.
---
Just wait till she get's to her first contested zone and gets to PVP. Bitches love to PVP.
---
I'm a 60 Prot Warrior on Blaumeux Alliance (NA).  I am looking to main tank in a semi-hardcore raid focused guild.  I'm mostly done farming my pre raid bis and I should have a full set of prebis gear by the end of the weekend.  I am a mythic raider in retail, and I aim to clear all Vanilla content quickly and efficiently.  I don't plan on pvping much on my warrior.  I'm free most nights, although I can't raid before 9pm est on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.  Although staying on this server would be nice, I'm not opposed to server transfering.
---
never happened to me on my owl
---
the owl did however rip threat from the tanks several times spamming screech.
---
Strong reason to have an alt.
---
If someone body camps my main I just take rez sickness and sit him in an inn while I level my alt instead (and I'll always leave the alt in a different zone for this reason even if they're similar levels).
---
(58-42)/42= 38%.  Tbh, that is probably pretty accurate to the true Vanilla experience lol
---
The patterns are what 2g and on Herod the bag is 45g. That is waaaaaaaay to high of a markup for nothing. So I'm just going to wait till everyone gets tired of it and I can go get it for the 2g.
---
definitely viable
---
probably not optimal
---
"Bloodbrew" honestly sounds like a cool Belf monk RP name.
---
Spells before level 20 have reduced sp coefficients. Rank 1 frostbolt will gain 5 damage from that enchant.
---
damnit..alrdy 75g on mine. anything else? lol
---
This is them already not sticking to the plan.  We don't get all of phase 2, just DM.  So the plan has been broken.
---
But this posted by a wow player who was "drunk" so I assume it's not a toddler we are talking about here.
---
Yes, the usual cold blood/hemo/prep build is one of the more popular builds for non dagger pvp.
---
mid/late november would have been fine.
---
this feels rushed. ultra short notice, and they're deviating from the launch plan less than 6 weeks after release. i really don't like the smell of this... sounds like they're chasing twitch numbers.
---
Buy your devilsaur leather fast.  It's about to quadruple in value.
---
It has nothing to do with mana cost. Other than spells whose coefficient is manually adjusted due to some other effect (e.g. a slow or other useful negative effect), spell coefficients are just based on cast time.
---
Further, just because it's less effective doesn't mean it's not effective. Especially at lower levels where your fireball is doing like 15 damage, having it do (1.5/3.5*30)=13 more damage is huge.
---
Well what do you expect when that person received 40 other whispers with the same crappy joke?
---
Shutup science bitch.
---
It's only going to help a player like you. It will give you three more instances you can run at 60 for you to get decked out in blues and be ready to raid.
---
What would be a good source of income for a prot warrior? My income is mostly from dungeon drops.
---
i could be wrong but i think BGs are phase 3, while pvp rewards will be phase 2. phase 2 will be fun without bgs cause people will be making pvp premades
---
I never put it away. RIP sweet prince.

This is my macro from retail and I know it's working:

---
Archeage Unchained releases October 15th. Interesting.
---
also can still mount when silenced, cant have your mounting counter spelled etc
---
Blizz knows activity is dropping so they are rushing things, hopefully they'll open wsg and ab together, that'll really liven things up.. But prob get that around Thanksgiving or Xmas
---
Wrong
---
I'm not at my laptop now but I think I have something similar set up. I'll let you know
---
Pro tip: it's not.
---
It's like when there lots of posts of people asking about how to level faster, and people would comment just enjoy the game! Don't go so fast! Your ruining the experience.
---
You have a great point here about people not even building their character to correctly benefit from the ‘bis’ list
---
wHy ArE PeOpLe TrYiNg tO lvl FasT

---
Just wait till you run into mobs that can full heal... multiple times
---
God you must be unbearable in real life. EVERYTHING is negative with you. ZERO positives.
---
I find it much faster to bind them in the native keybondings to my 10 key. 1.skull 2. X 3. moon etc.
---
Dude that's so relatable I actually wanted to laugh but that would be disrespectful
---
Prot warrior? More like any warrior or rogue. At very low levels it's a full heal and stays a large percentage of HP for a while. Huge saving on downtime.
---
Drop chance = 0.01%
---
    0.01% = 0.0001
---
    0.0001 * 0.0001 = 0.00000001
---
    0.00000001 * 100 =   0.000001% = 1 in 100,000,000
---
1 in 100 Million.
---
But that's only chance to get two epics.
---
I have no idea how to calculate chance that both would specifically be Kang the Decapitator.
---
Almost 60 is very very old. Be careful not to scare her with the game.
---
Rerolled into a rogue buddy into a tank warr
---
Coldblood + Hemo spec is fun AND great for swords. 
---
    I have been messing around with it and I have viskag + brutality blade. I Can assure you that it does infact work, quite well too ;)
---
Nah, the lack of BG's encourages wPvP, and I absolutely love it.
---
I'm hoping they delay BG's as long as possible so that the Hillsbrad slaughter can continue daily.
---
These boots won't let you solo facetank dungeons as a clothie all the way to the 60 and ride a mount from level 1 like heirlooms do on retail. This comparison is stupid.
---
The sooner tbc comes out, the happier I'll be. 🙃
---
Without the ability to see who is bidding and how much, the entire concept is terrible.
---
Self control chiefy
---
Orc druids OP.
---
Dire maul is level 45 to 54.
---
Do you stream full time or do you have a regular job on the side?
---
Yeah the people that report stuff now probably aren’t even offended. They just see a cool name and want to report it because they know a GM will have to make you change if they do.
---
Slow it down.
---
im guessing you havent played vanilla before.
---
Better keep content coming. People are at end game for phase one, and done on every single server. Casuals being caught up doesn't concern the hundred guilds that have completed all phase 1 content.
---
Doing better then me. I hit 31 on Saturday
---
It's not just streamers.  Grinding dungeons so you can do raids a little bit better is okay, but it's not content that lasts forever.  With BG's, and even honor so far off, it's not surprising people hit a drought.  Alts alleviate it a bit though.
---
More like

I NEED MORE RAGE

Remindme! 6 hours
---
Hey! That was my server!
---
Totally agreed.  Hit 60 this week and was looking forward to chill MC runs.  Now its back to dungeon grinding again to keep up
---
Its what I did, any time Im In southshore ill kill a few undeads In the yeti cave because some undead camped me for hours once when I was low level there.

He messaged me yesterday and his messages made alot more sense, I find It funny this guy bought another sub to whisper me.

Who needs family and friends when you have wow classic?!
---
Nah but in all seriousness that sucks man, glad you found the restraint to stay away from it! It’s like digital crack this game
---
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
---
GIVE ME MY FELSTEAD!!!
---
Sorry to hear that. I just manage my time with wow and family. Seems to be working so far
---
Since Dire Maul is coming out sooner do DM:E jump runs with a healer friend. Look it up for an explanation on how to do it. Strat

But I'm only lvl 45 LOLLLL
---
&gt; Self control chiefy
---
Yep, none of that here, I've found.  Sadly.
---
why are they rushing content? They should try and space this out as much as possible. There are a lot of people still working through content.
---
and mage water
---
What do you get at level 20? Shit I want speed boost on my hunter.
---
That’s strong man, you got some discipline, I respect that. I have studies, gf, I’m almost 30 yo and I got sucked right in. I tried to stay away and managed to do so for over 3 weeks til I was bored and installed. Just thinking of spending 10h/day on this game gives me anxiety but as you said, the game is too damn good. It’s like heroine. And I really want to uninstall but I’m weak lul
---
I do not play shaman nor do I have the reed, but I know some guildies trying to get full bis that farmed it for 100+ runs thinking it would be bis for months. Again it is not the end of the world, but I think more than 1-week notice would have been nice, especially because 3 days ago news came out about the timeline of phase 2 being late/end of 2019.
---
Far too soon. This really bums me out.
---
Because its a quick easy sell? Thats how people liquidate things fast. Good deals sell.
---
Under a week my ass. Who gets that lucky with drops? I know a guy who has run arena 50 times for one item that he still hasn't seen.
---
Yep my problem is that your first two tips conflict each other. I often find myself with a little rage and then don’t want to swap out to throw hits because I’ll lose the rage I pooled. Both good tips though.
---
I thought BC locks were busted with the SL/SL spec (Soul link siphon life) but holy shit vanilla locks are just as strong if not stronger. Fear never seems to break in vanilla.
---
cheap shot+kidney shot is a 10 second guaranteed stun for a sub rogue.
---
Yikes
---
Peruvians say men
---
Probably gonna get buried since I'm 8 hours late. But, they are totally doing this to keep their subscriptions up. August 15th is when a lot of people subscribed for name reservation. I've been 60 for a couple weeks and was going to not renew for a week or so for a nice break. But now I will most likely be renewing for the "new" content.
---
Shit shit shit, I havent been leveling fast enough. I was definitely 60 when it released before, or at least close to 60. I started playing like a month and a half before Dire Maul released in Vanilla
---
I laugh at you with will of the forsaken while I corpse camp you
---
How does this make launch content irrelevant
---
Yeah starting a new character, doing some of the quests I enjoyed having to read what it said and actually look around for my objective. "go slay those dudes in a cave north west of us..." "hm... should be around here!" etc etc. Actually having to read and think was a bit nice.
---
=
---
And then for some quests it's like "there's a raptor and it stole my silver, idk where it is but go get my silver" and then it turns out that you don't slay random raptors for it, you actually have to find a very specific raptor nest built into the side of some random cliff LOL
---
So sadly I ended up installing questie so I can toggle the markers on or off if I can't be arsed to figure out where an objective is. Go tell me to kill dudes in a big castle or some obvious mountain or  cave? Got it covered. Tell me to go hunt a specific random thing that may or may not be here or in the next map over? Yeah I'm just gonna look it up.
---
...that’s not how regeneration works...
---
And how exactly does that make them any more money
---
Lol my priorities are my children and life in general. This game is something I like to play for an hour or two here and there. I don't need to race to 60, I don't need to raid. Not everyone thinks the way you do.
---
Try harder.
---
Stoneskin drops off a rare spawn.  And armor is often underrated by players as a mitigation stat, but just because def cap isn't necessary for tanking doesn't mean it's a useless stat.  It still provides a lot of mitigation and not every raid has threat capping issues, especially Alliance side.  Mitigation is still very important for the vast majority of raids.
---
Satyr's really isn't a massive upgrade over Blackcrow, you get an extra 3 agi.  The 1% hit is the big part and that's already available on your ranged slot.  In a similar vein I use Battleborn for wrist, as I'd rather have the hit on a slot with an otherwise low stat budget and pick up the stats elsewhere.
---
Well if he holds the boat the front might fall off, everyone knows that.
---
Thank god. Bring on the mage water!
---
That ruins quite a lot of classic fun for me. Dont understand this decision.
---
doesn’t matter at all. it gives some more options at max level. it doesn’t invalidate any current content
---
First time I'm rolling lock, but I'm guessing the Tempest Talisman, Crown, and Brightspark Gloves for more spell crit.
---
do we know if the hunter solo tirbute farm will work?
---
As melee it is hard to kill mobs higher than your level, sometimes even the same level until you get appropriate gear, people have this idea that green mobs and quests are bad, but actually they are the most efficient!
---
This is what I dont understand. Everyone keep saying "TOO SOON EXECUTUS" but it's not like DM introduces anything crazy. In fact, it honestly would make more sense for DM to just come with the rest of the release dungeons since it only compliments them and adds to the general max lvl dungeon pool which is currently extremely small. DM being added early will have almost 0 impact on the majority of the player base beyond inflating the gold economy a bit.
---
Dude, I had the full menú of not hitting when I tried to kill a mob with a shield; miss, miss, miss, miss, parry, block, miss, miss, parry, parry, miss, hit hamstring, miss, parry, miss, miss, miss, dead. My will to play for the rest of the day was just gone.
---
I was short almost exactly 6g because I respecced twice. Had to grind it out in Dustwallow.

Leveling a warrior is pretty relaxed if you keep upgrading your 2h weapon, they are mostly going for about vendor sell price on the AH right now - instead of training that +5 damage to slam for 2 gold, get a weapon that hits for 20% more! Escecially later on when you get sweeping strikes and whirlwind, you can consistently pull 2 mobs at once. Make sure to get the slowest weapon you can find for more yellow damage. Doing dungeons is also a good idea for this reason, getting a good blue weapon means easy sailing for like the next 5 levels.

for lv60 rogue? hit chance without item is at 12%
---
Alt tab out and back in or just hit alt a bunch of times. alt is the default self cast key which would explain why nothing works. It's a bug that's been around for years and years. That's the only fix I know of that exist.
---
you enjoy it because its not retail or ff14
---
 going back to creating 2 water a pop is going to be horrible tho :(
---
good news is can probably earn some good money just by sitting afk in cities making water selling it
---
Now your shaman buddies will no longer need to farm it, how is that a bad thing?
---
AOE farming by letting mobs kill themselves on me.
---
It’s about the journey in the end! In fact I’ve used these last few days to catch up on professions and do some dungeons, I just find the first 40 levels boring as most classes don’t have a proper rotation and fun abilities, especially warriors.
---
Might be later removal :)
---
man that dude used it incorrectly and i confused it with another word. rip
---
How do you get the hammer?
---
Why so early? I’m new to wow but from what I understand this is a catch up dungeon and my server barely has any level 60s. Seems so rushed I’ve been enjoying just going at a nice steady pace playing quests and helping others in the world so I’m only 51 I don’t wanna feel rushed just because some people live in dungeons and burn through content let them play retail while they wait for the 95% of us to catch up at a normal pace.
---
&gt; I don’t think it’s nearly as bad
---
Compared to The pally That has self healing?
---
Too much content too soon.
---
Please slow down and stop bowing down to baby screaching streamers demanding content.
---
Yeh I’ve got some bad news...
---
&gt;Not it dosnt, tinker is dropping items for 2-3 gold and princess 1-5g. You can also only do 4 per hour if you stay longer than 1 hour so if you only do those 2 bosses you would get approx 20g per hour =).
---
Would also like to know this
---
it should be 6 per, since its a level 58 spell so 2 at 58, 4 at 59, 6 at 60, could be wrong tho
---
Mankrik Alliance here, Im level 28 still.
---
I'd say in SW and IF I've seen about 20-30 level 60s so far, with the average level range being around 30.
---
This is by no means scientific data, just an observation.
---
Heyo one last question if ya are still here!
---
using that same macro  /cast \[mod:shift\] Flamestrike;Blizzard 
---
is there a way I can modify it with #showtooltip that the other guy was talking about to make it show the tooltip for blizz/flamestrike?
---
If you read the chat , we were in a group - then he left . I tried to re invite him as i thought it might have been a mistake. He messeged me today and we had a good laugh about it . Thanks for your concern tho.
---
It's not ONLY a good thing.  It has downsides.  The people who are already 60 and already beat MC likely wouldn't need diremaul gear to do so.  The reason diremaul gear wasn't in at launch is because it outclasses a lot of other pre raid/early raid gear and therefore makes raids easier.  And now it is being released before any of the casual players who might actually struggle with raid content have even gotten to said content.
---

I'm going to name my first born XxLegolasxX
---
As someone who hasn't played wow in over ten years, I'd like to contribute my fond memory of hillsbrad becoming a battleground on it's own right in that little space between honor and BGs. I remember hundreds of people fighting between south shore and .. tarren mill? It was absolute mayhem and so much fun.
---
How dare people pvp on a pvp server. Quick report them then uninstall your game.
---
I wish I was here with an answer but all I got is my support for a good question. Hopefully someone far more knowledgeable than myself can shed some light on this because I also wonder the same thing !
---
im on windseeker too..  its great seeing the population boost..  rough for questing though
---
Pro tip:it is.
---
As someone whos basically raidlogging at this point that he was making is pretty related to the post. People dont know how gearing works and a list that tells you what is best helps only when that item drops, and also locks you into a one playstyle oriented build. Atm the best way to tell who is actually good at the game is to see what they are rolling on and what they are using in fights.
---
Same! Just hit 41 and Ive been no lifeing the game more than I do and others. I can't imagine any even semi casual players being close to 60 by DM release
---
Maybe they dropped off *because* of the long queues.. Not because they couldn't run DM.
---
#BOOM
---
HEADSHOT!
---
I installed Questie after a Warlock quest giver gave me this information:
---
"The other is Comar Villard, a man who remains faithful to his lost love, wandering the Wetlands for a sign of his wife."
---
I was to find and kill this man, wherever he was in this Alliance controlled area I was under-leveled for.
---
Yeah I was arms until around 50 and then I saw Thrash blade ahead and switched to get used to the rotation. Get a faster offhand imo I had 2 2.7s equipped and was pretty brutal. Not bad but once I put the dagger from Mara (not the epic one) it helped a lot with that 1.7 sec attack speed.
---
Bring on the dreadsteed woo already had my mats ready!@!
---
Kirtonos?
---
I approve
---
&gt; The entire world doesn't revolve around you in spite of what you might think
---
Damn dude, projection much? I'm the one who's advocating for the majority here, you're advocating for yourself.
---
&gt; No, not releasing a single scrap of new content from August 27th 2019 through to February 2020 would absolutely kill Classic WoW
---
Absolute bullshit. The players who are hardcore enough will play it anyway, and those who aren't will actually have the time to play at whatever pace they choose. By rushing it, you completely alienate anyone who can't dedicate 30 hours a week to this game. *That* is much more damaging, not to mention the longevity of the game will be crap. Why not just follow the original vanilla schedule? How is that unreasonable?
---
Agreed . We were doing the snapjaws in Hinterlands at the time it was quite popular and it was just kill 15
---
Has a single farm been confirmed to work in Classic? Pretty sure a majority of them are from private servers.
---
&gt;miss once
---
Yall miss less than 5 times per fight?
---
" I played a fair bit back in vanilla, end game tank for a competitive guild, raid leader for 25 mans"
---
I stopped reading after this because you just completely exposed yourself as a liar. There were NO 25 mans in Vanilla. There were a few 20 mans. NO 25s. 
---
Best of luck with keeping your girl interested though. Skimming through i saw that this is mostly about her playing for the first time. My wife playing made my game time so much better.
---
On my server , I've had quite a few offers 350-400 Gold for them , But i have not decided if i want to sell yet
---
Does he think Dire Maul is going to bring back 500k viewers on twitch?
---
Most warlocks lifetap aggressively to near death after each pull, refusing to bandage/eat/drain/cannibalize. It's maddening moreso because water is so expensive for healers.
---
When group has a mage, many warlocks ask for food but don't actually use them in the dungeon. They are saving them for soloing later.
---
Can I change the tab key from switch target to a macro I made?
---
Or they organize and beat horde twice their numbers.
---
It doesn't get better. You look at mobs the wrong way and the game just zaps you.

Life before death lowlander
---
Except there's literal streamers live on twitch with bank alts full of crystals/black lotus/devilsaur leather. You've got to be naive at the level of a child to think layering hasn't fucked shit up at least this much.
---
Mooost people transmog their Heirlooms in retail. So point 1 is sort of moot...and actually one of the -only- things I liked about looms. I just needed to tmog once and I could have my character look how I want.
---
At least for the first time Asmon does it
---
Lol 100 DKP
---
I honestly thought they would do right by classic after seeing its release, their dev talks on the future, and how they are handling layering.
---
Then they go and do this. This only caters to the no-lifers and streamers. This makes it harder for regular players to get LBRS/UBRS/BRD runs now that the playerbase will be thinned out even more between dungeons.
---
What does dominoes do, I see a lot of people recommending this?
---
Whatever helps you sleep better at night.
---
If it helps I saw the wand drop 10 times before even seeing a reed and it took two more wand drops, two tiaras, and 3 more reed drops to finally get mine. It was fucking horrible
---
Noone is confused by the vc vs dm argument, its just a troll. If someone in westfall is LFG DM not shit he means deadmines. Im already getting triggered by it lol
---
A mate of mine is trying to get into the game but he can't decide cause he wants to play something that 'feels' powerful - not necessarily is actually powerful. I recommended a warlock to him, since I am playing one myself and it feels great to summon demons and that, but I don't actually know enough about the other classes in classic to give him an informed answer. 
---
So what are the classes that 'feel' most powerful?
---
I want open pvp chaos as long as possible before people start spending their days grinding BGs. Whoever doesn't agree just shouldn't play on a pvp server. They literally signed up for the madness if they're on a pvp server! Kids forgot what vanilla was like it seems.
---
If you get a dagger that is better than your best sword, time to go daggers. Commonly this is when a sword rogue gets a core hound tooth or perditions blade.
---
It's fine you feel that way friend, but if the tank feels uncomfortable or is a beginner, you can't really fault him for being overly cautious.
---
But you are correct that some tanks are overly sensitive to losing aggro in classic, it just happens and it's stressful, but it comes with the territory.
---
I got a forced name change on Frostitute.  Literally the only reason I rolled on Westfall was because I could get that name there.  Now I'm stuck on a potato casual server and haven't touched the mage in a week because I have no idea what to rename that char.  Blizznazis won't fly, but I really want a giant fucking middle finger to Blizzard for being such bitches.  So if anyone has a good suggestion, I'm all ears.
---
Haha #redditmad
---
Yes we do! Don't play a pvp server if you don't like it! That simple.
---
Some dev kicked off the wrong jenkins job lol
---
Social media has its issues but I think this guy was just a spineless asshole who was afraid of hearing a response lol.
---
No, I meant buffs, both because of what the original poster was asking and because you said "buffs/debuffs".
---
Oh I understand your just ranting I get it. It gets frustrating sometimes but it’s literally one of the most integral parts of the game ! :D
---
It's called VC
---
zugjuggs 😂
---
Dire Maul's loot table makes a whole lot of sense for guilds working on Ony and MC, it makes less sense for guilds working on BWL. Beyond that, it's pretty ridiculous that Paladins and Warlocks have their mounts locked behind unavailable content.
---
Congratulations, you don’t need a carry. Other people do, and they’re willing to give up an orb for it.
---
They seemed to be handling things great until this. Now I have no faith in a Classic+.
---
Nah get gud
---
I believe it's coming with phase 2, at the end of the year. I'm hopeful it's coming next week, cuz it's one of my favorite things in classic.
---
Hunter into a lock...so pretty much another hunter.
---
A little background:
---
I was duoing BRD ARENA with a hunter and we got a freezing band drop. I asked him if he would like to 50/50 split and he said sure.
---
=D
---
&gt;Democratic party wants to offer healthcare to illegal immigrants, not a policy anywhere in the world. 
---
🤔
---
I usually do this too
---
Sometimes I'll put reagents on AH at vendor value in case other players need. Why waste?
---
Gorillas life or the kids. Still a tragedy, but still the right call.
---
Looks like we have a future goldshire dweller
---
Im also planning to gun for Arcanite Reaper as my preraid BiS for that axes skill, does anyone have any other cheaper/better alternatives?
---
Higher white damage vs higher yellow damage. I guess it comes down to how much hit you have.  I’m not a theory crafter tho
---
It was always called VC on my server in vanilla as well
---
because the devilsaur mafia set the price and when there's more money in the economy, they set the higher price of devilsaur.
---
Nah this isn't true, not so far in classic anyway.
---
I don't think anyone is going to struggle with the content, no matter how casual they might be. All the info is out there, and none of the fights require any sort of mechanics apart from not standing in fire, dispelling and at least auto attacking or spamming frostbolts. Almost all the fights are essentially tank and spank. Hell, there is an actual tank and spank fight - Golemagg.
---
This will have a very very very minor impact on the difficulty of the raid, trust me. If you are struggling with this content, it means that you are struggling with not standing in fire and spamming frostbolt and this gear won't have an impact at all. Maybe you will shave off a couple of seconds from 1 min kills to 55 seconds.
---
I can understand people who aren't 60 yet feeling rushed but I don't see any downsides apart from that. Besides, I think most people are in the low to mid 50s, ready to start doing dungeons for their pre raid bis, so in a sense it's the perfect time to release it.
---
Druid alt because I play both at once so the heals are nice even tho it's feral.
---
You catch the part about playing through LK homeslice?  The last raid I remember organizing weekly was the heroic Trial of the Crusader....but I got sick and tired of dealing with loot distribution, people bitching all the time, one person holding up 24 others, and all the other BS that came with being a raid leader, so I took a break, then Cata came out and I came back as DPS and played a bit here and there but I was burned out and wasn’t having fun.
---
Bruh wtf
---
I've noticed that the more role and team based a game is, the more toxic it gets. Becomes too easy for people to shift the blame.
---
Nope. Mirage raceway EU.
---
Yes STV was way worse. In my head I’m like don’t these level 60s have nothing else better to do? But I agree it is
---
World PvP is far better than BGs. I only wish there are no dishonourable kills so we can attack each others cities without penalty. In any case p2 will be brilliant as most have farmed their pre raid BiS and epic mounts and a lot of that PvP gear ends up topping raid BiS lists so there is motivation and free time
---
This is lvl 60 right? Im barely 30 lol
---
7:30-4:30, warrior. 52.
---
Get good nub.
---
Add up all the +hit from gear. There’s probably an addon for that tho
---
He said it so of course it happened
---
Yeah I'm the one with my "panties in a bunch" for laughing at you for losing it because you got ganked on a pvp server.
---
Cool, thanks :) I'll try out Mograine or Ashbringer
---
Thoughts on 2H fury?
---
I find that a lot on this subreddit. People want to be stubborn and refuse to read between the lines to understand your intent. Instead they'd rather argue with you over semantics just so they can "win" against you instead of having a real conversation.
---
Are the items dropped BoP or BoE?
---
Sometimes I see an ally tag a mob I want and I viciously murder them. Sometimes they turn around and destroy me instead. Sometimes I see a lower level ally run through an area and I protect them along the road or help them in other ways. I act on impulse.
---
Nothing that hasn't already been said, as well as taking professions that gave me helpful gear along the way.  Probably not dying a lot was helpful, a big change from the past too! lol
---
Southwest checking in der guy.
---
I was pretty happy having my main at 50 and a couple of alts around 20 but now im gonna blast my main to 60.
---
Lol he was just ping ponging with you dude
---
To be fair, you were rather antagonistic.
---
I like how you think him being a gnome is actually relevant, same with people who think all mages are douches.
---
99% of the time the people who say shit like "facts don't care about your feelings" are the ones ignoring facts.

Oh wow I really seem like I’m “losing it huh” is that ur definition of losing it? LOL

You should transfer to AR.

Oh snap!

Cool screenshot
---
The game doesn't tell you anywhere. You have to use an addon like [DejaClassicStats](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejaclassicstats) to see it of you don't want to just add the values up from all your gear.

Not to sound rude, but why put yourself through all that lol?
---
Warlock is a great suggestion. I might add Shaman as they “command the elements” and wind fury is very powerful.
---
You got killed in a video game and went to cry on reddit.
---
No i thought you were memeing in saying it was all because of the pservers but now i see you fully beleive that to be true and i dont feel like arguing on reddit with a mong
---
You can keep farming gold while there ends up being no one else to play with.
---
Because that's what happens when only 10% of the playerbase is catered to.
---
Personal preference dawg. He can read a description of each one but they all can feed powerful for different reasons. 
---
Warrior is the most obvious; plate armour and a shield and you tank bosses. 
---
Rogues stalk their prey from the shadows. 
---
Really no correct answer to this question.
---
People having more gold will INFLATE the economy, not tank it.
---
Alright dude, tell me why you think they are catering to streamers. You never answered
---
Now they are altering the content flow to encourage and reward people who no-life raced through the content.
---
The problem is FOMO is actually legitimate in a MULTIPLAYER game where you need other people to do the content. If you cannot find people to do the content by the time you unlock that content.. then congratulations! Game over!
---
What they should have done is delayed the phases even more so that people are punished for blowing through the content.
---
I have a buddy that works from home 3 days a week; the other two are half days in the office. Especially if all you're doing is grinding, this is very doable for some people, especially those who dont get 8 hours of sleep.
---
Not healthy, mind you, but doable. 
---
We started classic a bit after launch but he already has about triple my /played cause he just grinds while working.
---
AHHH ur gonna block me I’m so offended
---
Theyre not to be done every pull. You're not always gonna be able to pool or keep your rage. Sometimes you gotta wait for healer mana or people to wake up. But HoTing yourself is a decent way to get snap aggro when you dont have the rage. As the tank you sort of dictate the pace of the dungeon. Don't pull more than your healer is capable of but if you can, move faster than your dps. If the last mob in the pull is at 20% and healer mana allows it FF the next group. You can get a few swipes or mauls in as they kill that last mob.
---
Backpedals preparing for it jumps once thinks that makes it okay and faceplants
---
I think it depends on who is supposed to be catching up at this stage in the game.  
---
I play a lot.  Sure, not as much as some people on this sub.  But I get home from work and immediately log in to wow.  I spend most of my weekend playing wow.  
---
If my guild is any indication of the playerbase, I'm in the top 20% of levels in the game.  I'm one of the more dedicated players.  
---
Am I the one who is supposed to be playing catch up?

---
People were demanding world PvP. Who the hell was demanding more PvE? We're already buried. 
---
The average player still has months worth of PvE content to play. Please stop rushing. I really hope they decide to revert to the original phase 2 time frame it was perfect the way it was.
---
Thanks, I'm not afraid to share my unpopular opinions.
---
I'd rather that they just banned egregious racist shit and then let people be offended if they want to be offended.  I can't control other people having paper thin skin.
---
Imagine crying about a worthless chest
---
Not really, but I respec'd shadow at 40 and hated it so switched back at 44. But then the idea of questing as holy caused me to make a warrior (44 now) and mage (28 now) while my priest is only at 52 =/. Kinda screwed myself, but w/e.
---
It’s clear they’ve realised releasing old expansions will make them $$$$ so time to rush out TBC
---
The good news is you'd probably want to buy an epic mount eventually anyways because it's far superior for both farming and world pvp.  The mana cost sucks because it stops your spirit regen and the fact that it is a shadow spell lets a clever mage counter spell you out of your shadow spell if they catch you mounting..  It's not great when you think you're about to mount and instead you cant cast shadow spells for 10 seconds against a mage.
---
coming from an all horde server it’s very akin to this server, also there was a survey somewhere and at the time it was 70/30 horde/alliance, and when the arcanite reaper transfers came, the top 3 alliance guilds left for it
---
I assumed he meant pve I guess
---
ye def agi is better but these are the 2 best items i have atm for wrist
---
Oh my god we’re back again
---
This guy is saying blizz is catering to streamers and hardcore players. I'm trying to discuss why he thinks that yet I just get insulted by him.
---
&gt;quest mounts
---
I dunno about pallies but warlocks just get it from the spell trainer as a trained spell lol
---
It makes 10 at a time.
---
I don't give a shit. I didn't state that because I liked it. I stated it because it's reality. 
---
Now that still leaves the grand canyon's worth of distance between giving people more time to level and handing out welfare epics, but you don't seem smart enough to understand nuance.
---
I had forgotten about that!
---
Even if it did... why?
---
Heavily overgeared lol, if u want to do mc like ”everyone else”, level faster.
---
I got time, I respond when I'm taking a dump but that all the time your worth. I never claimed to "pwn you", but if want to call it that we can. Do you expect people to not comment in a comment section?
---
honestly you get tired of the grind after a few days and need some time to yourself anyway.
---
This is why casual sex is much better than a relationship.
---
Bro you're actually upset. LOL
---
If anything DM helps those who are "behind" because it offers great gear that you can take into MC.
---
No you're still going to have groups for BRD if nothing else it's the one instance that'll have tons of tanks running it since HoJ is in there. Not to mention Savage Glads and for the really insane Ironfoe. 
---
Healers still have Second wind and and Senior Designer pants and Hands of the Exalted. 
---
The only ones you MAY have not wanting to do it as much are mages and warlocks. But this idea that all the other instances are obsolete just because a bunch of caster bis gear is in DM is just panicking. 
---
DM has a bunch of great gear for other classes but it does not have all the bis for every class and spec. Hell even the tanking items in there are side grades not straight upgrades from what is currently available.
---
Can warriors do the LBRS exp run tanking it? It can be done around 54+ with 3 mages and gives between 60-100k exp/hour. It consists mostly of mages kiting anyway. About 2 hours per level.
---
I advertise mine as gluten-free.
---
dang dude. grats getting it tho.
---
I can see that but im also in the position that actually researches and trys to min max which means I know about the items and potentials with DM. 
---
Furthermore I explained this. My whole angle on this is as someone who spends the time to research and play, and my character is out there for people to dispute my validity.
---
It's probably skewed a bit to horde(most pvp realms are)  but 80:20 seems way off.
---
I used allyroute as well. 
---
...
---
I'm horde. 
---
Death to the alliance.

It's ok that you're sorry for not being sorry. We all agree and eagerly await your reading of the next Reddit post which will hopefully be less offensive to you.
---
So upset you don’t even know bro I’m deleting my chac rn that’s how upset I am. Thanks for informing me of what I feel :)
---
Awesome, thank you guys for the responses!!
---
Ok so one dungeon.. personally i need a bit more.
---
ClassicAuraDurations
---
it's just a variation of the same thing, the core is the same, and it's all 100% wrong and doesn't make a single bit of sense in the english language. try again.
---
These wounds they will not heallllllll
---
There's all sorts of unit frames and buff/debuff trackers that do this.  Classic one is WeakAuras
---
Honestly I see why people are upset, but I joined the game later in vanilla so this brings it closer to the one I remember.
---
Maybe, if they rush the phases out, when everything's done, I'm thinking it would be cool if they added new classic content. Like made new instances and stuff, maybe even higher levels and flying minutes, but with the intent to retain the feel of the old mechanics.
---
Intimidate/bandage macro sees me through just fine. if I get in trouble I will Intercept a nearby mob and hamstring it then book it. Seems to work fine for me even though I don't have to do it often. The pally DPS is just fucking sad..  clear so friggin SLOW!!! Again, just my experience. I likely just enjoy warrior more and am more comfortable with the class.
---
Nexus crystals dog
---
I’ve seen around 12-15 gold on my server
---
is there a way to get rid of the party bar on the left side of the screen that pulls out into the raid icons and stuff? i couldn't find an option to get rid of it.
---
Sad life huh?.. lol 😂
---
I think it was a quick edit since it wasn’t in my messages originally lol.
---
We can. However the mages left over right now are really bad.
---
Technically it's a mechanical construct which is simulating the behaviors of a primate.
---
See boat as you man. 60 for a week now and just re-spec'd and been running dungeons for pre-raid bis, finishing quests and working trade skills. 
---
Today after hearing this news I already compared the old bis list for my class with the post-dm one and started making changes. Didn't even have time to really experience the stuff that's out.
---
What an absolute let down. Blizz continues to fuck this up. :(
---
50/50
---
It either happens or it doesn't.
---
if you get the Quartz Cast Bar, it comes with a small weapon swing timer built into it.
---
You don't really want to discuss anything. You just want to win.
---
If you want to have a discussion, you should try and steel man the other person's position.
---
You last long enough to miss 5 times per fight?
---
Is the 15 year box the same exact size as the others? I am a bit ocd and want it to match. 😅
---
He also dinged on that kill.
---
Which incidentally just triggered anyone who has attempted to farm for that fucker before.
---
Bshout and Demo shout do almost no threat now.
---
I guess if you enjoy it then why not, why warriors in particular then?
---
Lol there’s a guy in the bottom corner
---
What do you mean no time? Why are you playing the game? No one is telling you to clear Ragnaros at the same time as streamers. Look at this sub, there are a ton of people who place at a slow rate. Let the people who wanna grind out content ASAP to do what they want. If you wanna kill Ragnaros 3 months from now that’s your choice. No one is telling you to play faster lol.
---
its virtually impossible to get 440 defense as a druid. because leather gear rarely has defense on it
---
Well not for everyone obviously, I would only support passive income for myself.
---
500g
---
Memories of Quel`Serrar......
---
You are weak get gud scrub......
---
My wife heals for me so she just throws things at me in real life if I dont let her get her mana back
---
Exactly what I was thinking. A large majority of the player base is not level 60 yet. They shouldn’t be releasing content because players are dying to “sink their teeth in new content”. I can only assume that they know best but please dear lord don’t let this be a pattern otherwise I’m going to be very disappointed. They could be spending time fixing the still bugs *cough* mobs running through walls and floors and not patching correctly at all *cough*
---
Nahh man, if that thing was worth 100G to me I would buy it for 100G. It isn't this, is why I'm not using it.
---
Hello, I tried quartz but I disliked the visuals od the bar, I much prefer the classic bar. I just reinstalled, going to see if that fixed my issue, thank you. I still haven't any idea on luna unit frames.
---
Just on them, I was only pretending to be retarded
---
Thank you so much! this really helped!
---
how do I do that
---
I love the comments directly from the article, people are so dumb and will look for anything to complain about
---
Tanks gonna help geared dps not have to worry about threat, atleast on horde side. Alliance already have threat management easy.
---
Holy BabyRage in this thread rn.
---
I usually tap after full dotting a mob from habit. Occasionally I'll get low on mana and tap half or more of my health away after a fight. I always bandage and cannabalize right in front of the heals to make sure he sees I'm not "that" lock. But most still drop a big heal on me halfway through either. Makes me feel bad
---
I'm a deep protection warriror **alliance tank on realm 1 on server westfall**. I'm looking for a raiding guild but I would like my healing friend (holy priest) and my warlock friend to join me. Let me know if we can do a package deal.
---
Oh sure, it was your "brother"
---
Also Ions reasoning for releasing Dire Maul early is because people are out of content to do. Suggest there are many more 60s who they don’t want to stop paying sub money.
---
He's got a new show, AMEND. It's a warning about the new show.
---
That is indeed an option, but none of the content is hard enough to make the Robe worth it imo, its not good for PvP either so who cares.
---
Oh man the “my work and social life “ blame , we all know your relationship was crumbling before Wow classic even started  I say they work on themself enjoy your game and stop blaming work and “social life” , you just have a shitty Girlfriend .
---
Closer to 20
---
I like this. DM was already out when I started playing retail classic back in the days (EU) and I am of the opinion that it just adds diversity to dungeons you can farm/level in and also some quality of life stuff (pala/lock mount, mage water, some gear). I haven't been 60 for long but it is a bit monotone and most people are just spamming BRD and Blackrock spire. They cant satisfy the entire playerbase at once but I don't get the people feeling they need to catch up. I remember enjoying leveling up with DM open and as an option to run as opposed to only BRD around the 55s.
---
Sells for about 20s each on the auction house on my server. Not a bad price after the quest tbh
---
When you get perdition's blade.
---
Good warriors
---
Today I found two Dwarven Hand Cannons inside like 30 kills.
---
Ya of course only a few actually reach rank 14 but my point is that no battlegrounds yet has no effect on gaining ranks. I don’t disagree that DM + PvP would be much more content but I still think honor system alone is enough to be a phase itself. And realistically, it was going to suck having to choose between grinding DM for bis or ranking up in pvp. At least this way casual, non streamers have a chance to do both
---
So the alternative is to bring 5 clothies that need on same items you do :)
---
You know what's the funny part? Even if you go full goblin mode and reserve all orbs/boes/vendor loot on average you probably make same gold as mage grinding zf gy.
---
Just read the tooltip.  Spirit increases health and mana regeneration rates.
---
tidal is really bad for rogue tho? in no time youll have 20 other trinkets to choose from, and tidal is never gonna be one of them
---
Did you do the prerequisites?

---
How much hit are rogues suppose to have for pvp?
---
OH GOD Druid vs Druid duels tooooooook forever, and some how it always ends with moonfire spam....
---
This does not answer my questions.. I know what spirit is for.
---
someone else mentioned it might be to compete directly with Archage Unchained
---
That’s exactly what I do it’s toxic tho I missed whole day in classic questing and I just lost my fuel to hit 60 so I been on 41 for three days now when I used to hit 3-5 levels in one day .
---
Wowhead has class / role BiS lists for every phase. Looking at them yesterday I found DM doesn't have much impact to those lists at least for a druid and that's with our MC set sucking ass. I'm mainly interested in the solo farm for the coin.
---
Painfull truth for those leveling as dps, um leveling a two-handed proteção Warren, easy af
---
Mana begins regenerating 5 sec after your last spellcast completes, unless you cast another spell. Mana regen is based on the Spirit stat.
---
Best advice I could give is don’t buy off auction house, sell everything white rarity and up on auction house because it’s all used for something, find a guide on what skills are actually necessary to buy rank ups or even purchase, and sweet talk mages into water/food so you aren’t paying a lot for the higher level stuff.
---
its not phase 2...
---
how does this even work
---
That’s all blizzard wants you to know.
---
Run this spec at 60 and you can effectively heal, tank, solo grind around the world, and PVP-  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxgMsczdxVxsoxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxgMsczdxVxsoxo) 
---
All you need to do is bring a set for tanking and a set for healing with you and you can fill either role just fine.
---
Yeah I was just get nostalgic
---
It doesn't.
---
&gt;Makes me feel bad
---
Yep, cuz you just wasted a bandage when he could have healed you sooner. Lazy healers man...

Currently enjoying the mage and taking it to 30 minimum before deciding what next.
---
So if I have 10k mana and 10 spirit my mana will basicaly never regen then? That’s what I make out of your answer
---
Huh
---
I’m still fine with this.. non max lvl players can still do it after all. Max lvl players have something to do. I think most ppl are now 45-55.
---
Ya. I don't really get some of the healers saying locks are lucky to get a heal or a hot
---
We have a really great community and I am very happy with the atmosphere we have cultivated. We are looking to start raiding in the next week or so and will likely sponsor a PUG MC within the next week or two.
---
If you are interested in the make-up of our internal raid group, click "raid" on our website and it will take you to a page with our raid group. We have a number of members not included on the list because they are just slightly too low of level right now (but are making very quick progress). You'll notice we have plenty of DPS, healer, and tank roles open! You don't need to be the best in your class; just willing to put in a little effort and have a good time.
---
Imagine actually thinking this lmao.
---
I’m guessing they keep rolling until eventually only one person rolls a 2. You roll a 1 your out
---
Holy shit i totally forgot about honor farming....
---
They announced a while ago that phase 2 is coming out before the end of 2019. A lot of people will be in that sweet spot to get farmed and it's gonna be the holidays. Seems like a weird time to release it to me.
---
I can offer some insight
---
I love being competitive in every game I play. I love playing games where I play against others. I love the feeling of winning a generally hard fought match. This has changed in recent years but I was definitely like the OP at one point
---
However, to get to that point you need to make sacrifices. It's the same with literally anything in your life, if you want to win you need to put in the hours
---
The joy I used to get from games is from winning and competing. Playing games casually doesn't give me that feeling of satisfaction, and I'd rather do something else with my time.
---
Personally, as I've gotten older I've shifted what my enjoyment of a game entails. I'm quite happy to go along for the journey these days, but when I was in high school/uni if I couldn't compete it wasn't worth my time. Playing casually generally means you won't be competing at high levels
---
Also, playing competitively doesn't ways mean it causes issues in your life. Time management and priorities do.
---
Did the exact same thing. Only realized once I raptor striked
---
Yes, please pity me because I didnt race to 60 and get all my set pieces already.  No, I dont want a chance to play the real vanilla experience, i want to be coddled and given ez mode, yes thats what i signed up for, thank you blizz
---
Oh shit... you still talking!?  😂

Nah, I'm on Rattlegore

Reminds me of my guild doing Gruul back in BC.  We were wiping with him close to dead, came down to just a resto druid alive on the opposite side of the room, moonfire spamming.  Gruul smacked him just as another moonfire went off, both died.  Still the most epic boss kill I’ve been a part of.

---
Way too fucking soon
---
I just got my 59-&gt;60 done in 2.5 hours and the mages weren't stellar, literally one used frost nova and all the others just used blizz + flame strike and it all went well. It can be done slower and still pump out 50k/hour. Contrary to what you hear here, some people do listen to tips. That farm is insane compared to anything else, I was pumping out around 120k/hour on my previous group there.
---
Yeah, I find myself right between these, where I can play 8+ hours a day no problem sometimes, but usually its by doing 45 mins here, 30 mins there, an hour there, with frequent interruptions. Makes getting the rest of my prebis difficult as a DPS class spending an hour just to find a group usually. Leveling is gonna be a no go soon, but I'm feeling kinda burnt on doing the 30-40 grindheavy or SM heavy section and that's right where 2 of my characters are.
---
Ah posts like this make me happy I rolled on a pve server lol

&gt;as a tank it drives me nuts to see locks just lifetap to full after a pull, that's my mana you're wasting.

More money, more problems. They have 25 billion more than the rest of us. Keep them in your prayers.

From 305 to 315 weapon skill, on a raid boss, 1 skill is 0.1% hit chance. For example an orc with an axe and edge master hand guards will have 312 skill and a 5.3% chance to miss, without additional gear. A gnome would have 307 skill and 5.8% chance to miss.

The mount's drop rate has been dramatically buffed on retail compared to what it is in Classic.
---
This is clearly too soon.
---
I thought Classic was about the more casual crowd, the majority of players, those who aren't even 60 yet. Instead Blizzard is catering to the elite no-life minority.

Not all clothies need the same items and some of us just go to make a bit of gold. I've had plenty of mages come in for a change of pace from the solo grind.
---
Don't even really need three mages either, two with a healer is a good base then fill the last two slots with whatever.
---
This might be news but I cleared MC and onyx first time last week with just blues, in a 20-30 man raid. A lot of people weren’t as geared as me too.. it’s really not that hard.
---
Also from what I see, the average player is now 45-55. A lot more people are doing now doing BRD full runs (probs for quests) and I hardly see SM runs. 
---
Funnily enough I’m starting to see more deadmines pt as well, the hc crowd starting up their alts lol
---
&gt; Heirloom items make every character look the same and the gear scales with your level so you never replace it.
---
So would these white items if everyone used them. Also, transmog is a thing.
---
&gt; Compare the time spent getting to max level in retail versus classic.
---
That's maybe a few percent due to heirlooms as opposed to other changes in game mechanics.
---
Do you realize how low the goat drop rate is though? I farmed 47 sheep before they dropped goat bait. And then my first goat got tagged by a filthy casual. So I farmed it up again.
---
Straight up skinners get it, as your example do we roll for ore not a chance go level mining what about all those disenchanting mats or herbs from open air instances no......your profs are precisly that YOUR profs if your the only person able then you get it by default if others could also attain it you roll with them you are absolutely in the right imo.

Unless someone was included on the run simply because they were able to skin The Beast, I believe only those who are eligible to skin should have claims to the hide.
---
Thunderclap.

I top DPS often as combat dagger spec (Shadowfoot Stabber MH, Shadowblade OH).  Even pugged MC as a 58 in group of 60s and was in third place out of ten.  Granted the game is still new and not everyone is decked out, but yeah.  If you know what you're doing you'll be fine.  Just learn the class like any other.
---
Very nice to know! Thank you!
---
Has anyone actually found Arash-Ethis in classic yet? I've been camping the area for 2 days looking for him and no luck! Was he taken out?
---
lmao so your entire relationship with somebody is wow?
---
:(
---
Addons, but hit is the easiest one since its hit hit rating, just % and based off your level. Wont see too much pre 50 outside of talents. Just add the numbers :)
---
His business is literally the content in this instance.

A long time ago, in a Classic launch far, far away...

Our guild was once named &lt;Guano Gang&gt;. &lt;Guano Gang&gt; was a small guild of roughly 1000 people, which a penchant for killing alliance whenever and wherever we saw them, in particular those of the &lt;Olymous&gt; variety.
---
On day, we logged into find that &lt;Guano Gang&gt; was now &lt;Guild CFCPW&gt;. Was it the "Guano"? Was it the "Gang"? After much back and forth with some GMs, we learned that it was, in fact, "Guano" that was the offensive part of the name. But why? Guano is in quest text. Guano is in quest names. Guano is a quest item. Why would something used so often *by Blizzard themselves* be deemed offensive?
---
Luckily, after a week of talks with GMs one of them *finally* saw reason and gave us our beloved &lt;Guano Gang&gt; back. The people of &lt;Guano Gang&gt; rejoiced! That is until the next day when they forced another name change because "The term guano is offensive".
---
TL:DR The GM team is fucking retarded.
---
How would stock cause inflation? You'd merely pay one time to make some of the money off of the 5% they're already taking from the AH.
---
Thank you! I appreciate and agree with your thoughts!
---
I really like just throwing my blueberry out there and I just sit in the back and dot them. So this is def the opposite. On the fence a little. Icy says to go blueberry other guides say not too.

I had Frostitute.  Got hit with a name change while I was in trade chat.  Appealed and was told by the GM that I was being toxic.
---
The short version is that the outrage culture has gotten ridiculous and not enough people want to stand up to it because some speech is definitely just meant to incite problems, but people take it WAAAAAY too far.  But it's hard to argue where the borders should be without getting lumped in with the bigots.
---
Ahhhhh. Damn my old age. The desire to run DM is strong. Especially the tribute run. The available time to level my 36 however.....minimal......see y'all in DM closer to December
---
Depends what he thinks is powerful. Big nummies, pulling multiple mobs, just general badassery, being unable to die. So many great classes.
---
Locks really don't have to go ham on using mana to get good dps as affliction. Throw up dots and wand if you can't get odd heals now and then.
---
That's usually enough to get at least close to top dps in leveling dungeons at least.
---
As a rogue
---
 in this order is what you should prioritize.

Tell that to the above asshole

felhunter can devour fear anyway. warlocks lose to melee, and hardiness helps a great deal when you resist an opener or charge. not to mention grenades, tidal charm, hoj, literally any stun resisted is so big
---
Well, assuming the Improved Seal of the Crusade is to make the Judgement better, then I don't know that I'd recommend this play style to other Ret Paladins.  We only have MC and Ony, which are largely pretty easy, but later raids will be tough.  As such, I'd expect there to be stricter adherence to optimal debuff slot usage, of which JotC does not fall under.
---
The result is a loss of 161 bonus spell damage right there, which is 39% of your total spell damage (250 from gear + 161 from the Judgement).  That's nothing to shake a stick at by any means.  Part of Ret's justification is how easy it is to keep Judgement of Wisdom up as well.
---
But even if we were to put that possibility aside and a guild going into later raids permitted JotC to be up, you're still choosing to give up DPS that is on the table.  I'm not seeing any obviously tangible benefit from this.  Any hybrid DPS spec is gonna need to put in more effort in order to be competitive and justify their spot.  If your advice to other Paladins is to not do that for no apparent benefit, then I unfortunately can't agree.
---
It's good that your current  play style is able to work for you.  I also agree that building spell power is likely the better way to go than focusing on pure weapon damage like a Warrior.  That said, if you were to advise other Rets follow suit without the need for seal twisting, I unfortunately can't agree.  I'd be concerned about setting them up for failure and disappointment in the future.
---
IDK, I'm pretty fine with those types of people ignoring their way right into being alone and eventually quitting.

Skullflame Shield already? Holy shit. Good luck with your guild, friend.

I just checked this morning and I was able to find iron ore for half the normal price on my server. All mats for 10.5s means 4.5s profit per attempt (avg of 3 grenades per attempt = 15s). I'll have my mount in no time :)
---
Thanks!
---
And yet they're dropping Dire Maul on us next week anyway to appease the people that nolifed to 60 and ran out of things to do (I say this as someone that's 60), which is mirroring the retail strategy of ramming content down people's throats to keep those sub numbers rolling.
---
Imagine thinking you "own" something that someone beat you to.
---
Hearthstone 1st slot 1st bag Always.
---
Literally yes, it's your fault.
---
This is why I went fury duel wield. 5 misses is nothing. And procing heals is so nice.
---
What does being 31 and not having time to sit there all day have to do with sex? Unless I’m missing a joke here
---
Note, MP5 and spirit regen both tick MP2.
---
So 10mp5 is actually 4mp2, or 12mp6.
---
Its also more confusing, as natural regen doesn’t tick for 5 seconds (MP5) after last spell cast, but after 5 seconds ticks every 2 seconds as well.
---
So... for natural regen on a priest for example(this includes in combat while not casting)
---
     13 + (spr/4)
---
My priest has 160 spirit at lv 29
---
    13 + (40) = 53
---
So after 5 seconds of not casting, I regen 53 **mp2**
---
For Shamans the equation is:
---
    15 + (spr/5)
---
So a shaman with 160 spr:
---
     15 + (32) = 47 mp2
---
Willing to work with newbies? Should be 60 this weekend and looking for a decent guild that won’t judge. From league of legends to classic is a jump :(

Got a buddy that just started. I sent him some 10 silk bags and a few gold. I'm only 34 on my main, then a few teens and a twenty-something. Was wondering if there's any good way I could help him out. Is running him through RFC/WC good? Would a 34 lock be able to solo WC easy?
---
&gt; Now you're just arguing semantics.
---
Yes, but that is not the problem you seem to think it is. Words mean things. Semantics is what words mean. I am saying that "screenshot" means a copy of what is on a computer's screen. Automatically rendering and exporting a picture based on what is on the screen is not a screenshot, and if you want help with that then you should probably not call what you are trying to do a "screenshot".
---
Right now?  Dungeons UD Strat can net ya 30g a run.
---
Also Strat living where all righteous orbs goto the tank like the good ol' days.
---
Barely anyone is full epics though. If anything it's just to provide more streamer content.
---
Generally speaking I'd say he prefers things that feel 'big'. Explosions come to mind, being an unstoppable killing machine, that sort of thing.
---
Oh I'm not saying Warlock's farm is as good - just that it's possible. Warlock's is obviously worse - you have to be constantly popping invis pots and waiting out the CDs, with no room for error (unlike hunters who can FD). 
---
Of course, any class can use invis pots can make it to king gordok - hell rogue can just stealth its way there. 
---
The challenge is that you need some way to split the observer from King Gordok. As far as I can tell, the only way to do this (without a second player) is to aggro king Gordok onto a pet (so only warlock and hunter) , and then reset your aggro (so only FD). The only other way I know to reset aggro in combat is gnomish cloaking device.
---
I’m 60 level hunter. How much hit rating makes me hit capped in pve?
---
Depending on the demand of the item, you can frequently sell items well above undercutters because someone (or a group of people) will buy all at or under market price and resell above market price.  Sometimes they have auction bots.  In those cases, undercutting only fuels them more and you throw away 10-40% of your profits. Your mileage may vary, server economy dependant, etc etc.
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat hmmm maybe, maybe...
---
Yeah, there must be some data on their end that isn't clicking for us.
---
Maybe the player base is starting to take a dive for the 55+ crowd and they are worried about retaining them. 
---
Because it doesn't make sense to hurt the experience of everyone under level 55 if that is the majority of the playerbase.
---
It does.
---
Very few people are going to get above rank 3-4 w/o bgs. So HK w/o bgs doesn't really make sense. But at least phase 2 brought DM. The separation of the phase 2 into 2 very unequal parts doesn't make sense.

Im level 51 and its happened to me on and off since my 20s. Its just pvp servers, some times you farm the enemies sometimes the enemy farms you. But I will say as you get to level 40+ there are many zones to level in, so you can quest elsewhere or find some friends
---
How is my fault? I don't encourage this behavior, I unfortunately care too much about what strangers are doing with their lives. I don't understand this world and don't think I ever will. I'm not going to pretend that this society is healthy.
---
I believe it was 9%, someone correct me if I'm wrong
---
Man it dropped for me in Winterspring of a mob. So god damn lucky to get a drop that I can use. Now Everytime I see a wyvern I have to kill it. I have this urge I cannot resist lol.
---
The justification for DM from posters above was server population.
---
Well, I was quite hyped to finally get all 3 map pieces and discover that it was a hidden treasure map! Unfortunately the location the key of the treasure appeared to be hidden in a zone that was too high level for me at the time. 
---
Needless to say, I have been looking forward to going back and completing that quest expecting some great loot or gold. I was slowly working on making my way back down to Tanaris to complete it. 
---
All of a sudden, I see an item with the exact same name as the quest I was so eager to go complete! I quickly put 2 and 2 together and found out the quest was for some lousy alcoholic beverage haha.
---
This was all just good banter between the person and myself... don't take it too seriously friend :)
---
Your BiS list is probably based on an excel spreadsheet that came out long after Vanilla was gone.
---
If you’re farming for BiS, you’re not having a vanilla experience.
---
Man this is the wake up call I needed. I gotta stop wasting time on video games which have literally no competition at all anymore, just time investment. (i.e. if anyone who is not genetically fucked could play as much as shroud or any other streamer they would be just as good and likely better)
---
It will regen very very slowly. However, mage armor means the 5sec rule does not apply to 30% of your spirit.
---
Have him search Youtube for some stuff like "wow classic class selection guide" -- there was a really good one right before launch I saw that went over every class and was optimistic about them all. Made me want to play every class though haha.
---
Warlock and Hunter are always great for new people because they do great damage while having the pet, super easy leveling. Mage is fun just for the huge damage and roots, blink, iceblock etc. Feels like you can really control a fight. The healing classes are so much fun in PvP and being just unkillable. Some of my best WoW memories are my resto druid in TBC.
---
Not much help but good luck! Maybe tell him not to Warrior unless you're playing duo primarily.
---
Lol
---
Charge gets you almost enough for sweeping strikes (esp if you have charge talent or simply leave extra rage from last pull). Zerker stance + auto (some dmg coming in or just blood rage) and you probably have enough for whirlwind. It's very fast once you get used to it.
---
I'm only in my 40s... I was bad at making money for my mount... always was in classic... I sold ports ALL DAY saturday till I could buy my mount. So it really is s give and take lol
---
First it was "you think you do but you don't", now it's "you think you don't want it now but you want it now".
---
&gt;OMG THEY ARE CATERING TO NO LIFERS
---
&gt;But, It's later then the original eu release and if it took an extra month to match the na release you still wouldn't be 60 anyway
---
&gt;I NEED SOMETHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT
---
Working all day and playing video games all night is depressing and lonely. Anyone that’s done it for a bit will tell you that. Just no way around it.
---
If you are solo que'ing for BGs you are doing it wrong, you want to have an organized BG team on voice chat.
---
9. 
---
Each additional hit percentage is listed "as-is". 
---
If a piece of gear says that your chance to hit increases by 1% then your hit chance has gone up by 1%. 
---
You need a total of 9.
---
Wonder if it has to do with archage unleashed
---
Yikes bro.
---
Subs staying on. 
---
Lets say Phase 2 is December (end of year like they said), that's 4 months of no new content. So if people were considering not subbing til then, now they can stay subbed.
---
Wave goodbye to all mages above level 54
---
I'm level 53 warrior and I've started to lose interest. I don't like DPSing and would much rather tank or heal. The problem is I can't heal. And the retail babies have sucked the fun out if classic tanking for me. I quit retail because I hate aoe tanking and yet that's all the retail babies want to do are aoe pulls. They said they wanted classic and retail is bad.... and yet they're playing this game like it's retail anyway. J Allen Brack was right. They thought they wanted classic but they don't.
---
Yep. If you start losing too much mana, drop immo. Its mana/damage is lower than the other dots and takes more time than them to cast too. You can sub in more wand or rain of fire / hellfire.
---
I've seen Critoralhood, Adotcritler (a lock, of course), Critoris, and Auschcritz. No idea if they still have their names, outside of the second one who still has it. No-fun-allowed GMs seem to be brain afk with that one, thankfully.
---
doesn't it just
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=progress&amp;boss=-1 If we look at WClogs alone - which does NOT include every guild in the world and also does not include PUG runs - you can see 815 guilds having MC and Onyxia clear by now, which is far from the majority I reckon.
---
I've got it clear. It's not hard at all. Just bring some time, make sure to pull trash properly, and you're almostt guaranteed to clear the place if your guild learns the fights by doing em 2-4 times.
---
Also the arguement that people magically are more busy now than then is just wrong. [Vanilla had a survery where the average age was show to be very much in the midst of a "busy state of life" so to speak - The number's 28 for those who don't wanna click the link.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/average-age-of-vanilla-wow-players/263208#targetText=Since%20many%20of%20these%20players,the%20ages%20of%2020%2D30.)
---
I know a *lot* of people in my guild who dinged 60 when BWL had been out for months. Did they yell at Blizz then, too? No, because in Vanilla, it doesn't matter anyway.
---
You'll still be running MC + Onyxia when your progress is at BWL. There's *tons* of good gear there, esp. with the final itemization of MC being in from Day 1 - Stuff like Aged Core Leather Gloves, Onslaught Belt and Bonereaver's Edge are prized items for many patches to come.
---
People need to stop freaking out. They're not even fully releasing P2 yet, only DM to give endgame players something to do without pressuring lower level players.
---
This doom-gloom mentality of many is really irking me in MMORPG communities. If they don't release anything the game is DEAD. If they do release it, they game will burn through everything in SECONDS I tell ya! (Despite Blizz saying P1+2 would be quick since they don't feature raid releases and people wanna run BGs anyway.)
---
So saw it once in 40 runs?
---
I don't know, but you can probably find some sort pf answer [here.](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/hunter-dps-talents-builds-classic-wow)
---
Dw youll get a version of a gold explosion once dm comes out ;)
---
&gt; You say it's "too high", but blizz knew all of this would happen and wanted it to be a rare expensive recipe that people camped for.
---
If you think Blizz intentionally only gave the recipe to a single vendor so that powergamers and botters could camp it 24/7, then you're vastly overestimating their foresight *and* vastly underestimating their game design skill.
---
Wait, can you expand? How are those good keybindings and what exactly is wrong with macros?
---
I still miss harambebe
---
We're on the patch that nerfed all content to death pre BC, a bit of DM gear is not gonna make much of a difference.
---
Alright cool, I've mostly been looking up info on my talent points (which I still can't decide if I fucked those up) so I'll try to find more info about the skills that I can skip while leveling. Do I need to be as tight-fisted when it comes to pet skills? Those tend to be a lot cheaper.
---
I’m a rogue with 10% hit chance. I can confirm something is going on because my abilities will still miss or dodge sometimes on mobs that are levels under me. Anyone else noticing this?
---
It's what happens when the content is so easy and so many people nolife it that it's already old. If they waited until the end of the year with it DM wouldn't even be run because most people would be BWL ready just with MC/Onyxia.
---
wow blizzard seeing that classic was succeeding so now they try to do everything in thier power to fk up that. nice
---
Imagine dumping your SO without talking to them about problems in the relationship
---
I just hate that there is literlay nothing useful in DM for mages. I got a really late start in classic (only was able to start on the 29th) and am only lvl 42. Since DM comes out and everyone is going to want to run those its going to be really hard to get groups for the other dungeons, while the new one only has new water for me...
---
Most warrs "tank" ZF with ravager. Bonus points for any additional ravager wielder in group.
---
I need to farm as well for TB rep, any tips?
---
? After the initial first turn in every turn-in is a stack. Redundant correction.
---
also head/pant enchants. everyone will want them
---
Dont lower level spells cast faster, increasing mp5 uptime?
---
Yeah, I get that. I just don't think those things are connected at all, as the problem of people dropping off likely has nothing to do with new content.
---
Ugh...tanks who dont wait for mana users.
---
Good on you OP.  My guild is full of kind and generous players and I'd personally want to know about incidents like this.  Thanks for taking the time out of your day.
---
None of the content is hard enough to use consumables, but good players still do. It’s a mindset.
---
Try icy veins
---
If I had my salt shaker on me I could earn 15g off that comment lol. I'm more inline with the average player and by the time it comes out next week I'll probably hit 60 and be able to do it. You're literally getting upset because they're giving us more content.
---
Stance dance.
---
Damn, you think farming BiS and raiding for hours on end is the only way to enjoy wow. That sounds like a shitty job to me.
---
&gt;Dire maul can be delayed for another month
---
This would be a significantly slower release than back in the day if you're from EU lol.
---
48 Hunter. Got sick of spamming lfg for hours so I'm a 24 war tank now.
---
What is the 2005 comment supposed to mean? There's like 10 times more dps warriors now tha  there was in classic.
---
Hibernate, when a Druid is in any form or a Shaman in Ghost Wolf they are considered a beast so you can hibernate.
---
Nice list,
---
for other classes I believe wowhead's guides list alternatives for BiS that usually include AH items.
---
&gt; That's what it's traditionally meant, but words evolve as technology evolves. Sometimes the original intent of what the word meant is no longer applicable. That doesn't make the word an incorrect or poor descriptor.
---
Well yes, it does, because as is obvious by this thread people have no idea what you are talking about. If your goal is to communicate then that is a problem.
---
&gt; I also understand that you have no proposed alternative.
---
That is not my problem, it is your problem. It is not my job to make up and popularise a new word for you, before I am allowed to point out that you are using the existing word in an incorrect and confusing way.
---
Time management is important. It's mature of you to notice the danger and fix it ahead of time.
---
haven't seen a boe blue drop on my 50 priest yet :(
---
You're a crazy man.
---
Also thanks for your help in Western Plaguelands the other day with that damn tent quest ;)
---
What if I told you that women are just people?
---
You're shooting for 9% hit. This changes depending on dwarf/troll weapon combos. 
---
Meaning at 300skill you'd need 9% or at 305 skill you'd need 6%. This is where the race/weapon comes into play.
---
Also, keep in mind Biznicks 247x128 scope schematic drops in MC and adds 3% hit if you're off.
---
lul  couple hundred runecloth is 20 stacks
---
&gt; All it requires is a single button spam which can be done with a lot of modern keyboards, without software. Yes they are AFK but it is not a “bot” or “script” in the traditional sense.
---
Your keyboard software is still software, and it absolutely is a script in the traditional sense.
---
This didn’t age well
---
getting randomly teleported to the Wetlands WOULD make it really hard to level in Redridge
---
It's not static but if you actually watched the vid he got 8. :)
---
im confused how a dungeon that provides mainly pre-raid gear make launch content irrelevant or make blizzard money
---
And DM will be there when you hit 60.
---
I seriously doubt I'll pay for another month if this is how it's gonna be.
---
Lmao they just releasing it all the way back to Azeroth soon
---
I've found myself chucking on a tv shows and just grinding too quite abit
---
Why would you split it? Sometimes people will pay for a healer too but it is completely separate and the tank definitely doesn't split with the healer lol.
---
Because designing the game around the most trash players out there worked so great in retail they should do it again
---
Sounds like screech is either bugged or your owl is too low level. Screech has like an 8 yrd range I think. Smaller than demo and battle shout. If the tank is just charging into what Im guessing is Lib and not pulling them back then any melee would pull. Around that level range. The mobs are pretty cramped in SM. The tank should be pulling them back anyways.

I don’t ignore people so “I’m very bad ass” lol. I’m guessing you ignore people for spamming LFM four times in a row cuz it hurts your eyes?

---
Classic DM is being released 7 weeks after lauch
---
Originally DM was released 14 weeks after launch
---
If you're below level 40 right now you would not have reached 60 even at original release.
---
Remember, the 10-20s mana pot is cheaper than the repair cost in the later stages.
---
Hah, same! She hates video games, so I dont talk to her about them. I play my games and she can watch her shows.

lul nice reading comprehension

exactly
---
How is it not slippery slope? Allies are already stronger in PvE because paladins &gt; shamans. Nobody ever considered pala tanks useful for progress, but if you give them taunt, maybe you create a unique solution somewhere that horde simply can't get.
---
Release is actually slower than back in the day if you're outside of NA. 
---
But please keep on panicking on reddit.
---
Just wondering at what level does it become better to cast shadow bolt over wanding as a warlock?
---
Shazzrah EU

Now it’s clear. Thank you for your time bro.
---
If you read the ToS you are pretty much Blizzard's slave and cannot do anything about it. Go out and enjoy the RL, just remember there is no respawn, rez, or ss.
---
Be grateful your not getting perma ban for account sharing
---
Yes you can!
---
Classic was never tuned for this degree of churn.
---
Hate to say it, but nothing Blizz does would be able to sate someone playing at your pace. The game will always be raid logging for you at this point.
---
? Your seriously asking this thread how you can dupe the ban you deserve? You fucking violated the terms, enjoy your ban and don’t pay people to level your account next time.
---
My keyboard has firmware level macros, is that still scripting? We can get as pedantic as you'd like but that isn't my point. 
---
I know what you are saying, but I was trying to get across that it's not a complex script software buying *only* that item. It's probably one dude spamming a single key with software and using the in-game script(which just buys out slot 30 + closes the window) to do the rest.
---
yup zanzils potion or something forgot what its called
---
I have no option but to play casually, but I get it. Raiding is fun, and you cant realistically raid if you're casual.

I have first aid linen bandages. That is what a lock gets if he is not drinking after a fight

Hi, /u/JohnnyFacepalm

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/deufoa/we_couldve_been_together_shakah_my_character_name/). 
---
Meh I already got to the point where I didn't need to log-in for anything except raids, getting most of pre-raid bis doesn't take very long. There are also a significant amount of people at 60 or close at this point, I think it is safe in Blizzard's mind to assume people not at least 50 (which is roughly when you can start DM) probably aren't the ones that they need to worry about pleasing.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I mean your probs lucky the service didn’t steal all your stuff as well
---
It's for alts I guess
---
Why?
---
Officer
---
Your answer is in your first sentence.... account sharing is against TOS.
---
It will still drop your combo points of current Target but it's still super good !
---
You used an ToS breaking service and we're punished for breaking the ToS. Now you want to lie about breaking the ToS to get your well deserved ban reversed?
---
You should have been permabanned, don't poke the bear and take it as a blessing that you still have an account.
---
Best advise is to get rekt.
---
Tellmewhen is great too although it can only track debuffs on your target
---
Same here. Blizz may be failing to understand that there are two very different kinds of WoW players out there. Those in a rush to get to the end and those who want to enjoy the world a bit.
---
You're welcome
---
Struggle would be real, wanna hope it's  a fast usb ma dude
---
BRD still lives because of HoJ and Ironfoe, alongside a ton of quests for EXP and MC attunement runs.
---
LBRS still lives on Hordeside at least because of the attunement, robe of the Archmage recipes and the offchance that the ring on the final boss drops - also UBRS attunement.
---
UBRS still has the Jed Trinket, Truestrike Shoulders, Rend bracers, pants, Felstriker, and on top of that is required for Ony.
---
Strat + Scholo have tons of good loot, many quests and Recipe drops.
---
There's still *tons* of great Pre-Raid gear in these dungeons, as well as EXP to be had for soon-to-be-60s and attunements. DM would've invalidated MC hard if anything, but since we got finalized items in MC in their final state on top of that, all this means is that there's some different Preraid BiS items there and people have 3 more dungeons.
---
Y'all need to relax. You have more content to look forward to now. That's all. P2 itself is coming later down the line, with the Ranks + Worldbosses anyway.
---
Let's be real here, there's very little content in Classic where minmaxxing is necessary.  Making paladins playable tanks in raid isn't going to let the alliance achieve things the Horde can't match.
---
Didn't thought about that. It's middle of the night for me, I'll try to do it tomorrow.
---
Spending ages finding groups to do elite quests or dungeons at lower levels is a pretty big reason to "rush" even if just a little bit.
---
Level 15-30 content is already a lot less active than just a month ago. Checking LFG channel (a lot less DM/Stockade/Gnomer and even SM LFM has been fewer than before) and general chat in regions belong to this level bracket for yourself.
---
I doubt he assumes it is going to bolster WoW back to the top but it will definitely give the content creators more to work with which means the ones that moved on or are struggling to find stuff to do will now advertise the game again. Plus I don't really see the downside tbh
---
Saw a group who had everything on reserve for deadmines the other day (greens for D/e and blues) And they wondered why they couldn't finish a group and were getting laughed at in general
---
God I had such a lock in brd the other day...
---
Nice!!
---
I'm a 19 yr old at uni and I'm not 60 yet and neither are any of my friends
---
This shit is on another level of cringe post material.
---
They are still offering it, I just found out today. However I'm probably here to stay. I don't like the idea of leaving my friends behind, so if they all move, I will too. But if not, I guess I'm here for the long haul.
---
can these posts die yet
---
I love new expansions, it makes it feel like wow again for a little while.
---
SL/SL will always be the best spec
---
That literally isn't an answer to my question.
---
:p really probably should lol. I thought keys were like 100$ turns out they are only $20ish
---
Yes they are. Because while for a level or two a quest reward I'm a dungeon maybe better for one or maybe two slots. Heirlooms are pretty damn close to BIS for your entire leveling period, and for essentially all your slots.
---
This is like the difference between someone just hitting 60 with a BOE epic and leveling greens vs someone in full T2. Like sure that one now epic maybe on par or better than it's counter part... But those two characters are not remotely close in what they are capable of.
---
There's no proper time for the phases and hoping that they stick to some strict schedule instead of adapting to what makes the most sense is a bit absurd.
---
I hope they release the content when it makes sense and that they avoid sticking to any plan they've made before the content was out and being played by millions of players.
---
Can you link?
---
Unlikely... Can you show me prove?
---
I feel like people feel offended by this as it's basically saying "If you're not 60, you're too slow since we're adding new content but it's not for you yet".
---
It doesn't matter at all if you're still leveling; DM won't shank you, it's just 3 more dungeons with decent gear.
---
The only thing that kinda sucks is that this'll change the economy quite drastically.
---
&gt; Any chance of participating in phase 1-2 pvp without epic raid gear is already gone.
---
It's really not. Those bosses were easily cleared in blues first week and they'll be easily cleared in blues in the months to come. Decent raids will have a lot of people coming and going in the next few months, other guilds will start raiding on their own etc.
---
You might have to join a bunch of people like you and put a bit of effort in rather than stomp the entire instance (which is really what most people want), but you don't need epics to raid.
---
No such thing as hit rating as far as I know. It will all be listed as percentages.
---
You mean you basically told him to go to the Npc and check how many per turn in lmfao plz go learn English chnk
---
Honestly, I don't like questing with others. Even my vanilla friends. While I'm leveling, I prefer my own pace and if I do group with randoms, I /leave after that one quest. I guess I'm a selfish quester. I love group content like dungeons and bgs.
---
The premise behind catch-up gear is that there's something you need to catch up to. Some people don't like feeling of being pressured into playing so that wont be left behind.
---
It's pretty young to have a grandkid who is playing wow and drunk.
---
Around level 25 you can get the Warson Boots from the Ashenvale chain and it's worth putting minor speed on them.
---
Run some /who's on your server. Join a large guild of randoms. 35-45 feels about right to me too for the curve atm, but of course nobody but Blizz has the backend data.
---
Uh no to all of that.
---
You gotta be kidding me. Makes me wanna farm brd on my mage now
---
Cat
---
Gorgonzola
---
Too soon
---
That's a very lofty assumption, the % of the population that will get geared has no direct relationship with total population
---
Generally if you're running someone through stuff you're just taking all his exp. He's better off doing it those with people his level. 
---
Of course, you can help him farm gear, but the lack of exp he gets while doing it probably makes it not worthwhile.
---
Players are what makes this game.
---
A low-pop server might as well be shut down without cross-realm anything because good luck getting anything down.
---
I know people love to complain cross-realm killed server communities and I do recognize its role in that, but playing without cross-realm battlegrounds or Group Finder on a low-pop server is just straight up demoralizing. They were implemented for a reason: players *wanted* them at the time because they needed it to improve QoL.
---
Go to your faction's Auction House.
---
Look up the price for 2x Felcloth.
---
Look up the price for 1x Mooncloth.
---
Find the difference between the two values. That's the approximate price of a Mooncloth cooldown.
---
[first google result](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit) my guy
---
I don't see what the problem is here, but then again I play on Australian realms.
---
You assume they never planned that anyway? I think P2 is a lot more to do with PvP than Dire Maul and a lot more people are looking for battlegrounds to be in place than anything else.
---
I grabbed Imp Blizzard and Shatter. Start with FN then two blizzards, then FN and Flamestrike + COC they’re all dead or 1 arcane explosions finishes them.
---
I missed the jump to the ST entrance.
---
Twice.
---
Hey someone understands lol I’ll take the downvotes for my other comments I don’t care.
---
What’s the difference between videos games and some other hobby that takes hours and hours, or worse tens of thousands of dollars.
---
A women is gonna leave you despite what your hobby is if she leaves you like that instead of communicating and understanding of said hobby.  A real partner would talk to their spouse and help if it becomes an issues in ones life. But at the same time couples need their own space and probably more often than people think.
---
I got 5 horde off the chain by brd. 
---
They just kept running towards me..
---
Windseeker here as well!!!
---
I found that previously too, I also really enjoyed the plague lands zones back in the day so that helped too.
---
Not true. Demo shout got nerfted hard, Bshout got buffed.
---
Yeah, it really is. Makes a huge difference.
---
Pinchy
---
Every guild in vanilla had DM gear when doing MC. 
---
DM was released March 7 2005
---
First rag kill was April 4 2005
---
Such a touchy subject!
---
they would spent that time playing wow anyways, so no socializing. And some raids for some reason run on Sunday nights or Wednesday
---
I cant believe how tilted you guys are lol
---
Same, I think of it as shopping at the mom &amp; pop store vs Walmart
---
6% hit is sufficient if you specced 5 more weapon skill.
---
Thank you for writing this!
---
Make sure you make it a night elf priest so you can shadowmeld and cast mind control from that. It works especially well on the lifts in Thousand needles.
---
Fits right in with me who hit 60 the week after BC launched. Granted I didn’t start playing until a month before shadow of the necropolis patch. WoW was also my side game after Halo 2.
---
I really hope the blanked out part is Groot.
---
&gt; actually emergent gameplay
---
A lot of it is illegal botting...
---
If you're already doing MC it's not that big of a catch up dungeon.
---
what do you mean can be shared with others?
---
Shhhhhh.
---
Doubt
---
The Fiery Enchant recipe is selling for less than 1g on my server &gt;&lt;
---
Tried this with my partner, but on top of her having no idea how to play an MMO, she's left handed so it really didn't last long.
---
30/0/21. I'll link to one later but essentially you only need a handful of deep restoration shamans in your raid for the buff.
---
&gt; Requires Level 5
---
Fail.
---
Plus you are missing the Wispy Cloak with the armor enchant and either the Thin Cloth Armor/Tattered Cloth Vest with 100 mana or Cracked/Dirty Leather Vest with 100 health.
---
If one warlock has the mats, other warlocks in the group can also use them.
---
Remember having to show up early to raids to summon wager for everyone.  7p Raid time.  6:40 for mages.
---
World first Rag wasn't until after Dire Maul was released in vanilla anyways.
---
Hamlet
---
Paladins are more powerful as buff dispensers.  Letting them tank wont change that.
---
Imagine pristine non nerfed DME
---
Oh you guys don't have level 35 super elites like Stitches walking down the main road of a low 20's zone. Easy mode must be nice.
---
Miss Miss PARRY
---
Its honestly not that bad get over it. I was one of the first 60s on my server and didn't run a dungeon since wailing caverns night 1. 
---
Go mob to mob. When you get sweeping strikes two mobs at a time unless your weapon gets out of date.
---
Prioritizing efficiency over speed will carry you. Play safe and get to 60, its not hard.
---
maybe even this but also there is lot of ppl in my guild and server that already facerolled trough everything and are like "so whats next" where im still stuck at 57 since leveling priest is balls, feels like every dungeon groups wants 60 lvls for current "endgame dungeons"
---
Maybe more cuz it's pure luck to a certain extent on the higher pop servers
---
CheeseTusk
---
How is this enjoyable?
---
Do you also dislike companies that employ proper SEO to make sure their website is as high on search engine results as possible?
---
You're definitely better than most locks I grouped with, many lifetap to near death and just stand there.
---
I’m at 4 days to 44 right now orc warrior. first time playing wow let alone classic. been coached on skills/talents to put my points into from my brother. Everything else I’ve learned from playing dark age of Camelot (another MMO) I am coming to a plateau because my whirlwind axe is becoming obsolete. Any tips for areas to grind: quest till I can hit those high level dungeons?
---
I do it as well sometimes, I don't invite warriors. If they want to do dungeons, do it as a tank, not dps and roll on my defense gear at the same time.
---
nobodys tilted dude why you heff to be mad? (:
---
The late patch itemization already made that a moot point, DM has some nice stuff but it's not like the early kills didnt happen with dps that made their the average BWL raid look terrible.
---
Sweeping strike whielwind cleave cleave CLEAVE!
---
Omg this happened to me twice. But they we all ended up on a pve server, and I desperately wanted to play on PVP.
---
Convince them, Im telling you it's just better on heartseeker. Horde know they're outnumbered so they're scared to engage, dungeons are so easy to group for, and I dare the Skeram horde to come here and balance some servers.
---
No I think you’re good. I think.
---
The r/classicwow sub has more than double the active users than the r/wow one, despite about 30% of the r/wow sub's posts being about Classic.
---
Before Blizz broke the census addons, they were showing Classic at triple the number of players than the Retail servers.
---
It's clear which one is "dead"...  It was never a question.
---
Yet, you go over the r/wow and post about Classic and your posts will get downvoted to oblivion.  Head in the sand mentality.  
---
I wonder what Blizzard will do with this info at Blizzcon...
---
Maybe be nice and give it back
---
I think he can report it but I don’t believe anything will happen.
---
Manbearpig
---
Never played alliance before. 
---
Why has nobody made a fat drum track from goat hoof beats?
---
Mine too!
---
As Alliance I kill every Horde running there. I killed the same UD Made 8 times. If anything he gets my respect for determination.
---
Are you me? Literally just did this yesterday as well with the impression I'd have a leg up for a couple of months
---
hell no I wont send it back if i I wont get banned for it I am not giving it back sucks to be him bro thats a free mount for me im only lvl 23 and struggling for gold
---
I’m new to classic. I didn’t start playing until BC. What is the epic Hyde used to make? I’m curious because you said it is going for 300g so it must be used to make something awesome.
---
Its not dumb ass. Read the ToS. Blizz have confirmed. Cant make this any simpler for your dumb ass.
---
just toss light on the warlock and its all good.
---
Didn't you know? Random reddit users know more about the game than the actual developers.
---
gotta feed the streamers, rip
---
Yup. You did good. Once I got the skinner I started mentioning at the start I plan to keep all my skin just in case.
---
Don't have to worry about it if you START with hamstring!
---
Yeah lol. Oglethorpe is also an ingame character, but I've been posting here since the sub got made. =D
---
Why? Once the pvp system is here you will actually have a reason to kill people your level instead of ganking lowlevels.
---
Looooool look at you, you’ve devolved completely to just throwing insult after insult to try and belittle me. Speaks volumes about you mate. Good luck.. for real 😂
---
As a mage I only need 2 pieces from DM. That can be replaced with MC gear. Deffinitly wouldn't say it makes gear obsolete
---
If you read the comments in this thread, there are way more people saying it is too soon.
---
Im stoked and i cant wait for wpvp without bgs.
---
You realise that he is not correcting grammar yeah?
---
swipe is awful, start with tab mauls on shit.
---
I NEED MORE RAGE! NOT ENOUGH RAGE! I NEED MORE RAGE! NOT ENOUGH RAGE! I NEED MORE RAGE! NOT ENOUGH RAGE! I NEED MORE RAGE! NOT ENOUGH RAGE!
---
Or you can try not being a little bitch.
---
He left out all level6-10 questing hubs because they all have trainers
---
Keep in mind that we already start with 16 debuff slots. Even when Nightfall is introduced there isn’t really 16 debuffs that will take precedence over SotC. Hunter’s Mark, Wisdom, Annihilator, Nightfall, Sunder, Double Curse, Ignite or Winters Chill, FF, Imp Shadowbolt, Shadowweaving, Gift of Arthas still leaves you with 4 to play with, unless I’m missing something major
---
400gold that shield in the AH on my server i am really  thinking to buy it.. but on the other side.. if i don't i will always hope for it to drop when i farm dungeons :P
---
How you just gonna leave Roaregard dead like that? That's some pretty bullshit.
---
People like you are what ruins the game. Asshole.
---
Yeah lets shame people who put it in the title who are recruiting because thats scummy and toxic haHAA
---
Please quit this game, you are dumber than a rock.
---
you ok bro?
---
I think your addicted to the 😂 emote
---
you couldnt transmog them back when i played retail
---
This is incorrect.
---
I hope to god that farm works. So hard farming gold as holy priest
---
Imaging your SO Is so Invested In a video game that he even admits his social and work life are In ruins because of a game.
---
But hey, waymen bad, vidya game gud
---
Well I’ve seen groups give all passed bop blues to be de’d and rolled out later but the enchanter always gets the first win automatically each round for the service. In my experience.
---
You **can** get in at 45. You cannot go through the entrance at 44.
---
Nah, that’s a dick move.  Be a good bro and send it back, it’ll make the guy’s day and you can walk around with your head held high, knowing you did the righty/tighty thing.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVFd46qABi0
---
Side question, how did you like the recent movie they put out?
---
fuck, thats like next week. i dont evne know whet level this place is for
---
yup. i was being lenient as hell. thus it boggles my mind that they are releasing this earlier.
---
congrats!
---
lvl 44 here
---
can you share the details?
---
Actually he will get his stuff back. Specially seeings how he has messaged back asking for it and there was no chat log of a trade going on.
---
Do they?  Shows how long it's been since I started from level 1!
---
Did you zoomcleave a lot or something? Otherwise no idea how you were able to hit 60 that quickly whilst not neglecting your family/job.
---
Thex!
---
I sneer at your 3.30 DPS staff. Check out the [Long Bo Staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=767/long-bo-staff)
---
4.20 DPS!!!
---
I was leveling my rogue and I was getting parried by tigers.. shits unreal
---
I think these actions are wholesome, so I do it every day. For Azeroth.
---
To be fair, they’re asking for like 7 second of your time. You’re asking for an hour and a half of theirs.
---
As someone mentioned you can use engineering, I believe there's a repeatable quest for some sort of REALLY low dmg thrown bomb somewhere too pallies used to use isn't there? In general though yeah sometimes they won't be able to pull, in this case they could though.
---
This is exactly it. I tried to no-life retail for a couple weeks before classic launch and I barely got flying in time because there is literally no way to grind the rep to get flying.
---
I could go for a scrap
---
They are literally tables that an intern in the design department can pull down through the floor on it's y-axis. They have two sets of feet.
---
Im new to WoW completely but I feel stuck :(
---
All my quests in darkshore are for a few levels above me, and I can't do them because im too weak. It feels like there's a gap from where I am (14) to level 17. Am I really supposed to just kill bears for 3 levels straight? Did I miss something somewhere?
---
Time to get some Int gear on my Priest and go gold farming
---
Lol, found the edgelord.
---
Lol whatttt.
---
Damn, I'm only level 40.  Slow down lol
---
There is a pop up saying “are you sure?” When he sent it to you. You do not need to return it and you will not get in trouble. Can he spam trade chat saying you are an asshole? Sure. But at the end of the day it’s up to you to decide what you want to do.
---
There are plenty of us in the same time constraint situation. This means plenty of us will still be questing and progressing together.
---
Even leveling an alt back in the day post BWL release, there were still tons of people to level with, it was never hard. If the playerbase is dedicated to this same loop, it should be fine.
---
Im a rogue and do 5 BRD anger runs a day and Killer him 34 Times as of yesterday,saw HoJ drop 2 Times and Roth Times the tank Ninja needed it...feelsbadman
---
Boar. Highest effective HP, high instant threat w/ Charge, which also roots if you need to pvp. Also, because of their high armor, they scale with BM armor talent and make your Mend Pet stupid strong (like, tank Rotgrip with T1 bonus strong).
---
Depends on the person for sure. I need my own space, my wife doesnt so much. So we meet in the middle for sure.
---
It's more complicated than "Red is Dead". I mean, if you care about your own future experience. What server are you on? Most PvP servers have more Horde. If you are playing KOS you should have made an effort to get on one of the few that have more Alliance so you aren't contributing to faction imbalance. I'm not saying this to help the poor little Alliance on your server. I'm talking about what's best for you. If you are on a Horde dominated PvP server then Phase 2 is going to totally suck for you. In order to rank up you'll have to sit and camp flight points for hours at end since your side will have driven all the Alliance from the zones.
---
lol new rogues are such cancer :(
---
You don't get Anger management?
---
I would really appreciate if someone can explain to me why it's possible to cancel auctions.
---
Thats really upsetting. you find something good with low bids and then it gets cancelled.
---
Don't post it that low in first place then
---
Saying leveling is boring is edgy?  Man you must party hard
---
Duuuuude. Sounds like me trying to get into Desolace as alliance. I wound up in Mulgore and couldn't find the entrance to Desolace my map said was there and had to go back out and around and down. A LOT of walking ensued. Just to kill 2 mobs and get 1 quest item for my mage wand. Then to turn it in and be ganked as a 36 mage fighting a 40 elite multiple times. Then A high level horde Hunter took potty on me and like 2 shot the mob. Gleefully go to turn in my quest for my fancy wand to find out that the online guide was wrong and I don't get the wand. I then got another quest to kill something in Ulduman and am relatively confident I ain't getting that done now. Then resign myself to pugging SM Lib runs for that sweet sweet staff that the damn warlock stole from me! (Side note, still using the damn staff from deadlines).
---
I think the idea is that there are more mobs and nodes to farm due to layering, so the supply of drops and crafting mats is higher.
---
Sounds like my wife. I’m an introvert and she’s an extrovert. We drive each other crazy sometimes because of differing ideas
---
That would be cool but i dont think blizz will do that. Imagine recreating the entire of Azeroth. Yeah well thats not happening
---
It doesn't use up a global cooldown so you can start your mana regen earlier. Also imo looks cooler and if you consider the time, effort AND price (it's only like half as cheap for paladins) having early is definitely worth.
---
It's not really catchup gear like modern WoW though. Very much alternate progression.
---
Start by getting the fuck off the game and talking to people, lol
---
Find a good grinding spot and grind some mobs. Questing seems to fall apart around level 30.
---
HKs are the thing I'm most excited for of any content, so it wouldn't be lackluster to me.
---
I don’t rush. I enjoy the game. My goal is not to get to 60 ASAP. My goal is to enjoy the game.
---
No.
---
When Seal of Command’s holy damage can be missed, parried, dodged and resisted.  Very cool Blizzard.
---
The recipe drops in BRD like every time, ofc its going to be cheap. I meant the enchant itself - saw skinning knives for 10g, the shards alone cost that much, plus essence of fire is 5g.
---
"Oh good, I counterspelled that Pally's heal. Gonna let him drop combat so he can mount now" - literally nobody
---
And nothing of value was lost. You probably wouldn't enjoy playing with those people anyway.
---
Are you ok?
---
AV archers were tough in original vanilla though, iirc they were very high on the NPCs with the most kills charts blizz used to release and were a big part of why AV favored alliance. 
---
In general though I agree, I never got to raiding on pservers but i have heard they made some things tougher.
---
No need to feel sorry for anyone who intends to do serious or semi-serious pvp. The class mounts cost mana and are on a global cd, which is actually quite annoying if you like to lifetap and then mount immediately.
---
And of course, the mounts are a 3-second long invitation to get counterspelled or kicked, especially the latter when you are in the open world.
---
Damnit Blizzard here I thought I had time to level my hunter... now I have to fast track the whole in at break neck speeds.
---
Battleshout is massive single target threat, beats sunder at 4ish targets and can hit up to 9 targets, cant miss, be dodged or parried.
---
In WotLK I dinged 80 on my Rogue by finishing my World Explorer achievement.  Got [Explore Icecrown], [Explore Northrend], [World Explorer] and [Level 80] all at once, the most achievements I could figure out how to get simultaneously. 
---
None of my guildies noticed,  just got some "grats" for dinging 80, no mention of my special accomplishment. :(
---
And even with mortal strike up those fuckers still heal to full.
---
I usually tell those locks “your dps ain’t good enough for you to be tapping like that”
---
Mate ive been trying to get shanker.. 4 runs 0 shanks. Hopefull i get it next run :(
---
No, dipshit, saying "people who like it are just casuals" was obviously to part I was referring to.  Tell me, are you just this stupid on the internet, or actually like this in real life too?
---
The fact that they feel the need to point it out is so funny to me. It's like when someone in real life says "I'm ignoring you."
---
Oh are you?
---
Think that means ur addicted bud. If u wanna cancel plans with family cuz of it. I get taking it super serious and wanting to be competitive. I put almost 1800 hours into rocket league got to champ 2 and almost 6000 hours into black desert but that was open and running 24/7. Black desert for me was an addiction though. Didn't want to do anything else...don't cancel plans go enjoy time with ur family
---
What's your /played dude?
---
Whatever you say bro :)
---
Then in December it's gonna be the same exact crowd saying "wow blizzard a majority of players aren't 60 yet wtf why so fast!" And its just going to keep happening. Is it too fast? Probably. Does it mess up content for anyone? Absolutely not.
---
There is no reason to delay it. Nerfs to some of the gold farms world be nice, but this adds new content for people 55+ so they don't have to spend their entire day  running the same instances all day. 
---
On my server of you aren't 60 you're not getting into any end-game dungeons.
---
I feel like this is bait considering you made a post earlier today saying you've never played classic and were just about to start, can't see a new player getting lvl 23 in 6 hours
---
did they miss or did they dodge? two completely different things.
---
Same here with priest a couple days ago, the main reason I decided to play classic.
---
Hi, /u/DishoveledPanda

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/deuxh5/can_i_copy_a_retail_bartender_profile_over_to/). 
---
Only took a dozen runs, and it's not even far off the supposed average. ~30% chance to drop the trinket, won the 4th one that dropped.
---
My rogue guildie was spamming those runs for 2 weeks every night for his rends though, can't envy that.
---
Talisman isn't even top 3, you have Scholo neck at int/20shadow, the 1% hit/int neck in Strat which is better because 1% crit &lt; 1% hit with no hit. Crown is worse than a 40 shadow wrath by FAR. Felcloth Gloves give WAY more damage than Brightspark at +33 shadow. Mp5 is trash, you're playing a warlock.
---
Yea, what I most want is Arena and for that I have to wait for Tbc. But running premade BGs would be fun. I don't rly care for raiding, i've always been a pvp man. Atm the only pvp you can find in my server is getting 4v1 by hordes or ganking low levels and is that fun cause of the unbalanced nature in it.
---
There's also a g- filter, which lets you filter by guild.
---
You can search without the filter specifications, such as "/who Warsong" but if there's a guild named Warsong Raiders and you're after anyone in Warsong Gulch, you're in for a bad time.
---
Oof, blizz tryna hold off that archeage unchained release ig

---
Joanas is paid now, so deleted that comment.
---
I haven't logged into retail in a while so I may be mistaken, but isn't that what you get when you crank up the graphics to max?
---
It's not about the damage. It's about not having to use a single bandage until level 30 as a rogue. When health is your only limiting factor because energy is infinite then this heal means much much more than fiery's superior damage output.
---
Or just do buyouts
---
Yep, still using it while tanking at 58 currently.
---
To be fair most healers and DPS get annoyed when no one is pulling waiting for the healer to get to max mana.   
---
As a tank I often get told "hurry up", "go go" or even the healer starts pulling themselves if I wait  for that.  
---
So it's not really a matter of "tanks don't want to wait" the majority of healers don't want to wait for max mana themselves, its about getting through the dungeon as quickly as possible which is fine.
---
Mine dropped in BRD too. How much is this worth when BG's are open and twinking starts?
---
Going to hold on to it till then since it's only going for 100-150g at the moment.
---
That's all there's worth talking about. The staff actually might be better if you've been running the green +37 shadow wrath staff. I'm probably going to slap +30sp on it instead of new moon+19/+21 offhand as I don't want to farm dragons. And I like crit.
---
I don't think those keys are legit but last I checked you can still activate W10 with a W7 key. Not during installation but after the fact inside W10.
---
If you're the only one who can skin it, it's yours. You don't roll on minerals if you're not a miner.
---
I reckon it's layer squishing, which they announced was happening last week.  
---
Since last Thursday or Friday Yojamba (second biggest Oceanic Realm) has been Full every night, since launch it only ever got to High.
---
ZF is doable at 44, I recommend 45. There aren't a whole lot of options for weapons, I think there are a few decent axes you can buy from AH. 
---
Badlands + Uld is also a great option for XP to get you over the 44-45 hump then grind ZF/Tanaris human mobs.
---
Oh really! I'll have to look into thanks thanks bruv &lt;3
---
Pretty sure this is wrong as fuck lol.  Post your proof of this.
---
In Classic? I've barely had bad pug runs but it'll likely get worse as time goes on. Most of the early level 60s know what they're doing, it's the ones who get there much later who might be new to the game or just don't really watch what they're doing who cause the problems in pugs for the most part.
---
How is life enjoyable? I'd rather not work.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/unitscan
---
Fairbanks if you’re Horde. It’s sometimes full but queue times are generally no more than five minutes.
---
The add-on task bar on the top of the screen, does anyone remember what the name of it is? It’s been a while since the last time I played wow and I use to use that add on, but I can’t remember the name:
---
Don't know its very skewed on grounds of keeping me online with remote desktop so that I didn't have to sit in those god awful queues for the first weeks. But at 60 my played was 9days and that's with ALOT of hours in queue. Got alot of my preraid BIS items on my first runs in dungeons and got 300 gold from an epic i sold.
---
Someone has snagged Alden on every RP realm...
---
Think of it this way: That's just time you're wasting in raid/dungeons getting your "BiS" that is ultimately meaningless. 
---
I just collect different stats.
---
Haha, nice!
---
You likely have. I got pretty damn drunk on Day 1 and would not shut up for like 8 hours.
---
The players under 50 will just group with other players under 50 and do the full dungeons. There is a subset of players who are optimizing their time, but you don't have to let that affect you.
---
The most important part of this game is finding a group of like minded people to pay with. Trying to play solo in pugs will probably lead to quitting.
---
That’s why we do what OP did and you don’t get bought
---
Did you just setup your interface before power went down? Interface changes only get saved when you close your client normally or use /console reloadui
---
Are the demons not terrible with proper kiting?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/two-handed-axes/min-req-level:50/max-req-level:60#items:0-3+18
---
No!
---
&gt; I work full time and I'm level 53 with 7 days 14 hours played played.
---
This is a really slow leveling speed especially for a Hunter.
---
But think about the no mana cost and lack of silence stopping u from mounting up. That will keep a smile on your face maybe
---
Definitely too soon
---
Actually the bank does give your money back. And I know they return the goods because I’ve done the exact same thing before. They don’t double the gold. They take it back. If they spent it I guess those items get confiscated and deleted(not entirely sure as they don’t tell you).
---
You can cancel the spell right at the end, staying within the 5s. It's a lot easier to cancel a rank 2 greater heal than say a flash heal. Also, the mana cost should be low enough you can always be casting it and cancel at the end. Obviously make sure to keep renew up etc. It's a way to help stay in the 5s and spirit helps your regeneration when you aren't in the 5s, too.
---
I hit 34 and realized the time it’d take and I wasn’t even having fun. No interest in AA, hope you enjoy it!
---
FINALLY! After such a long period of waiting... now we get the good mage water ahhhhyeassssss
---
What’s a good addon for displaying stats like hit rating, critical rating and etc, without changing the classic UI?
---
Seems like you are an awful person.
---
&gt;It's what happens when the content is so easy and so many people nolife it that it's already old.
---
It isn't old for the vast majority of us. Most players aren't 60 yet. Pugs fail miserably because people screw up mechanics.
---
If that's why this content is being pushed out, Blizzard is dead wrong in that regard.
---
I need a macro to 
---
1) equip a set of gloves with skinning + 5 as well as finkle's skinning dagger 
---
2) equip my regular gloves + weapon set if finkles/gloves are equipped
---
Off the top, it's black lotuses that are rare, purple lotus are a dime a dozen , worth maybe 20 silver.
---
Second, it's 4 in the entire world per timer. 1 per zone, 4 zones, variable cooldown ~60 min.
---
That's 96 per day x2  (all servers have been 2 layers or lower since early Sept, blue post about it this week) that's 192 per day maximum.
---
When it's one layer that's  down to 96 per day. It's brutal , and it probably will matter that there are more people per server now than in vanilla but it won't matter til BWL/AQ/Naxx progression when flasks are actually needed for certain roles / fights
---
I need context. Also gratz on getting the shield!
---
Huh. Must have misread wowhead
---
Absolutely! 100% uptime. And even if you have the set bonus for the 15 minute buff you still need to shift out to cast Omen of Clarity every 10 minutes. So the extra 5 minutes isn't a big deal. 
---
I thought you were saying the helm gave you more Thorns uptime somehow. My mistake.
---
You're a clown you are only 23 after all this time and someone with that much money spent a lot of time getting it and is a lot more dedicated than you.
---
Keep it, you will always be a clown
---
I believe they have confirmed it will be present in Phase two but perhaps there will be a gimme and they will throw it in with this update
---
The gear is far too good to be allowed out in this phase of gearing content. It was catch up gear for P5, on par with P3 raid gear.
---
Retail and classic looks the exact same to me minus updated models
---
We didn't have 15 years to figure it out. Back then we didn't think you could AOE grind as a mage from 1-60 in a handful of days but now we do. (Even without layering)
---
As someone else said, the problem is it's all grey items, it doesn't require an established market. It just generates new gold out of thin air.
---
I understand down ranking isn't a direct increase to regeneration. Sorry if my post was misleading. I figured priests reading this would know why I said that.
---
The dagger is Library.
---
Reread his former reply.
---
Nah, I’m good
---
He didn’t say “not being 60 is miles behind” he said level 32 or 38 or whatever is. I’m sorry but that does seem behind the curve. Is that a bad thing? No. 
---
Regardless, why be upset that they are releasing content for 55+? Everyone will still be able to enjoy it, even on their own time.
---
I HEARD the weapon miss swoosh when I read this.
---
RIP economy
---
This is way too soon
---
Good enchanters will buy cheaply priced greens to DE into cheap chant mats too. There should always be a demand for player crafted greens and blues.
---
Chedder (mix of cheddar and shredder)
---
nO iT's nOt!111
---
Meanwhile a good chunk of people didn't play on release, which had less questing hubs so they never got to 60 prior to DM releasing, and those that did are partially EU, which got DM like... 40 days after release, too, so there's almost no change here.
---
Seriously, Reddit gets upset about the most interesting things.
---
"i just hit level 24 and i like it"
---
Reading through trying to figure out how to get this portable install working there's a lot of dependancies. Not just drag and drop.
---
I just wanted to chime in to say this is unlikely. Some places will allow USB devices (stupid but my company doesn't have this as locked down as they should either) but very rare you'll be able to install anything outside of your user folder.
---
Blizz caters to casuals! Fuck Retail!
---
Blizz caters to the 0.1%! Fuck Retail!
---
Which one is it now?
---
Nope, not on PvP servers. A lot of those people should have picked one of the other kinds.
---
lmao didnt feel like re rolling but im a lvl 23 warrior
---
That's pretty good! I'm at over 10 days and only lvl52. Taking me forever as a warrior
---
This is my hope. People are going to be massively disappointed with the reality of phase 2 (Honor system with world PvP only).
---
The whole world PvP for Honor gear thing will quickly devolve into groups of tryhards camping high traffic areas (Flight paths, Dire Maul courtyard, Blackrock Mountain, etc) to farm HK’s against unsuspecting targets. This is simply the most efficient way to farm Honor out in the world, and that’s what the rankers will be after - efficiency, not fun.
---
It’s going to be extremely boring for the rankers &amp; it’s going to make the game borderline unplayable for casual players. You’ll have to corpse run multiple times to get into any dungeon or escape from a flight path landing.
---
Here’s to hoping WSG comes sooner than phase 3 so that rankers have something actually interesting and semi-competitive to do &amp; people who just want to run a dungeon can do so without 30 mins of corpse running
---
The damn sound when they start charging  up that firebolt, ugh!
---
Yup. I'm a prot warrior and feel so bad for dps and heals having to tip tanks because they are so scarce.
---
Go back to fortnight and fuck off classic, scumbag.
---
Yep, both are really good too.
---
Hk's will be a huge deal.
---
I shelved my 60 for now until they're back as Wpvp Isn't incentivized  enough.
---
Only because you're looking at it wrong.
---
If  there's 10 humanoids and you refuse to group, you get 5. If you do group... You get 5.
---
If a 3rd person comes along, you get 2.
---
The basis of your entire mind set is mathematically incorrect from the start. So them offering is just your way of justifying.
---
Dropped in Winterspring from me! You can always get the shield from... Lbrs I think it is
---
Lay off the speed mang
---
This is the absolutely dumbest piece of advice i've seen on this sub yet. Casting 2-3 shadow bolts, a shadown burn and an occasional lifetap along with eating/drinking is in no way going to make you a better lock than if you were drain tanking. If anything, you learn a million times more about resource management as a drain tank, not to mention that it's just straight up superior for leveling
---
Graphics are already the same. Unless you're talking about models
---
Didn’t they say that was coming in the first patch?
---
It's almost as if they're not catering the game to casuals only.....
---
I believe it begins 5 seconds after mana is used? I am fairly sure that casting a channeled spell triggers the 5 second rule at the start.
---
I think dragonkin had almost double the drop chance on green/blue/epic items than normal beasts and humanoids.
---
Plus they drop cash,and are skinnable. Very nice for farming.
---
If you’re doing PvP outdoor because of the PvP system, then you’ll avoid killing lowbies since it gives Dishonorable Kill.
---
Is there a hit cap? I'm at 10% right now for my rogue. Is that good?
---
Theres a difference between doing a normal pull when the healer is at 75% and doing a 'fuck it, im charging in' pull when the healer is at 50 and had only been drinking for 4 seconds.
---
Not interested in the graphics, i'd rather they not waste time/money importing such minor fluff.
---
Don't come to Reddit for loot etiquette ... they don't represent any group and tend to be the outliers. 
---
There is no answer for this... truthfully. This topic has been fought and fought and troll and fought since UBRS from first ran. You are correct that no other profession has to share. However no other profession can only get a material from a dungeon/raid (outside real raids) with no other source. You are correct they can't get that skin without a skinner+knive but you can't that skin without that raid group EVER.
---
Next time bring up the loot rules before getting to The Beast. Get a clear answer one way or the other.
---
Yo shout out bigglesworth
---
I have a lvl 7 dwarf there. he went to the undercity, it was fun but I don't know where to go next with my dwarf.
---
Seeing people's reactions to a dwarf walking around in their cities is awesome.
---
His name is "Wilstone" and hes a good boy.
---
Oh my bad! Oh and no, not really going to be an issue. I PvP'd on alts when they hit 60 all the time in vanilla without issue.
---
Why are people so convinced that EVERYONE has already hit 60, run MC every week, got full tier and epic everything, and if you haven't you're screwed?
---
Winning BG's in WoW is about teamwork, not gear. I used to run organised battlegrounds, only ever lost when people wouldn't listen to what I told them to do.
---
It's really just weapon, rings, trinket and chest for hunters.  But it was stupid to have to farm hoj as a hunter just to get a second dps trinket.  And Barb blade is barely better than peacemaker.  I definitely won't be continuing to farm Savage glad though.
---
Been enjoying the ease and simplicity of leveling a paladin. I am wondering though, what role do I play in dungeons? I'm speccing ret for leveling, if it helps.
---
61 eh? World forst?
---
Questie
---
Un'goro will be a messy hell-hole when the honor system comes out without BGs.
---
Nice
---
It’s not 5 sec after not casting because I can use inner focus and then another spell and that doesn’t reset the counter since I didn’t use mana. Would it be more accurate to say 5 seconds after you last spent mana?
---
Yes you dont want the helm or leg enchantment, attribute stacking is fcked up probably because it changed a lot how stats stack over the years and blizzard used the modern version of the game as a base.
---
Unless you are a semi hardcore player, you shouldnt be scared tho cause you need to stack flasks, bufffood, consumables, worldbuffs, scrollbuffs etc to hit the number of buffs where you would delete some buffs with your enchants.
---
Randomly losing your 10% spellcrit onyxia buff just because you have like 8 Spelldmg enchanted on your head will really suck.
---
This absolutely ***infuriates me*** in the AH. I can't tell you how many times I would be trying to sell smelted bars in the lower levels to get mount money and there's that one fucking guy who puts whatever up in the AH for an uncomfortably low undercut price, while also putting the bid price at a ridiculously low-not-worth-putting-anything-up price to compete Just so he could be the top of the list to guarantee someone would see and buy his shit first. Little did he know he was fucking up the market alongside everyone elses chance to make any gold
---
I remember when I started WoW back in the day. Same thing is happening now. Price discovery.
---
The second day after launch someone was trying to sell a Engineering pattern (skill levels 125) for 3g...hahahaha. I tried to get a minor speed enchant after a couple days and the guy wanted 5 gold..hahahaha.
---
And then you have people who think their green level 10 boots are worth 10 gold. 
---
People try to get rich quick and end up with nothing while the people who make steady gold win the race.
---
Oof I meant 60 fml
---
Attacking people who are fighting mobs. Typical boomer hordes
---
&gt;Remember that OH attacks deal 50% less damage by default
---
Doesnt 5 pt Dual Wield Spec mean that isnt an issue? With 5 pts, offhand does 100%
---
had them both drop back in vanilla
---
we actually gave them to two different people. When the first one dropped, someone already had the other one so they got it.
---
Ni ether do fishing poles :(
---
Good one!
---
why?
---
Pick up herbalism as well and you should be set. First aid is a secondary profession
---
Farm robe of the archmage tailoring and runecloth bag recipe from winter spring then get Tanaris fishing recipes
---
Yeah I'm running both on my 41 ele/resto shaman haven't found anything better yet
---
You’d be stupid to pay 2g 40s for one stack of that shit
---
Because skinning knives don't count as a weapon so you can't use half your abilities.
---
+damage items increase damage.
---
strange as that sounds.
---
people need to grow up.
---
It's a game.
---
if you want to be specific yes
---
Because without epic mount, you are easy pray and a anchor to your raid.
---
If you're on a PVE server, i guess it doesn't make much sense to invest unless you play a gathering profession. But on a PVP server, in a contested zone, god forbid an actual pvp arena like Un'goro you'll get literally shit on till you sr.
---
Without epic mount you are a stragger or an ancher moving behind your raid when guild moves to MC. This is a deal breaker for any PVP-PVE guild that has to move in force to the mountain.
---
Yeah, I was speaking from experience haha.
---
Oh your keyring? How bout you learn to read first dickhead.
---
Alchemy is nice if you dont care that its super common so stuff may not sell alot but if you dont care go for it , make sure you get herbalism too. Personally i like engineering on rogues fits the aesthetic in my opinion :P
---
I just do it to keep my accounting ledger a little cleaner
---
Lol you kept it?! I felt bad when dude paid for portal and send money to my box. I thought he sent like 75s turns out it was 3g. I sent it back. Dude was low level and coulda needed
---
If this is the quest I'm thinking of, felwood escort inside the underground tunnels I did it with another hunter of the opposite faction :^)
---
Missing once causes a domino reaction in which you miss(parry, no dodge) all your next 20 attacks and you die with under 30 rage.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
The quest objectives do not change based on grouping or not. I assure you I'm not the one looking at this wrong.
---
Yeah his videos are hilarious.
---
These are the mats required for dreadsteed chain quests 
---
35 black dragonscales
---
6 large brilliant shards
---
10 elixir of shadow power
---
25 dark iron ore
---
3 arcanite bars
---
I love the classic line when someone Wipes first “idk what happened man, my health bar just went away”
---
Most of the quests will be added in phase (When they add AQ)
---
I personally like bagnon as it puts all your bags into one, allows you to see your alts bags on any character AND if you click or highlight an item, it tells you how many you have in your bags or in your bank. Question was mentioned and I second that. Classic castbar is also nice. Lastly, vendor price. Most of these are QoL Addison’s that have been implemented for obvious reasons. Questie I always feel bad for using though because it takes the adventure out of quests. Even though most things you would search up on wowhead or thottbot. I guess there was an immersion to doing that.
---
Was there not something like ,you need to ask the bank within two weeks for the money or otherwise the guy who you send the money to can claim it back again? 
---
It never happend to me so I could be wrong.
---
Reddit = new trade chat,
---
What are the attributes of engineering again? I honestly can’t remember haha.
---
Yeah you are a clown. 🤡🤡
---
Yeah I do a lot of consumables like 6 as a tank and 7 if I flask basically.
---
This, and most rogues don’t have the 3p Nightslayer bonus
---
Yeah I'm 40 and thinking of changing because I'm not feeling it... I'm casual but not mega casual (around 7 - 15hours a week) ... I really don't want them to rush because once content is done... It's done... 50% of the player base should be pushing on 60 at least before phase 2
---
"There is literally not a single person on earth whom this is easier for..." is an objectively false statement. It's easier for many people which would be why they choose to do it over the alternative.
---
Do you forget to breathe sometimes?
---
Macros can't check what you have equipped.
---
Actually more like $5 on ebay. Got my Pro licence for 4€ from there.
---
I joined WoW way late in the game. I started playing when Legion was out and BfA was on the horizon. When Classic released I was like....why not. So I picked an Elf Warrior. I was told by my entire guild that I picked both the wrong class and the wrong race.....So this post speaks to me on a deep level.
---
Was just out in STV on Grobbulus doing the horrible Bloodsail ship quests... A shaman came by and saved me on the boss pull of the first ship... I helped her, and then we ended up sticking together and clearing the other 2 ships together.  Was a great experience.
---
Yep Alkaiser / Kugen do a Cancelaura on like HoT's basically on a macro.
---
You shouldn't be able to whisper someone if you're ignoring them.
---
anyone seen the massager
---
It's like what everyone was freaking out about over layers, but real this time and not  breaking any rules
---
&gt;Even if I am halfway done a quest and join someone who just started, I stay until we are both complete.
---
19/20 quest items gathered. *Justarrivedlol invites you to join a group* every time man. I generally don't mind helping either, but sometimes I just wanna move on.
---
Yeah. The Wetlands ones do. 0.7 drop rate.
---
And it was all legit? 5$ pricetag would scare me lol
---
Seeing as 80% of your damage is Autoshot, Mp5 is pointless. The better route would be to use less mana. Sure you will kill stuff slightly slower, but you will not have to stop and drink.
---
It can still bubble heart
---
There is indeed a hit cap, and at 10%, you're probably over it.
---
The short version is, you can't hit cap your white attacks, and you shouldn't even try, because they require too much hit chance, having something like a 25-30% miss chance. Your yellow attacks, meanwhile, can be hit capped, and that only requires between 6% and 9% hit chance, depending on your weapon skills. 
---
White attacks are autos, yellow attacks are special abilities. The reduced hit cap of 6% is for any weapon you are using with at least 305 weapon skill.
---
Dude, I'm glad we're getting Dire Maul. Retail is getting fucking furries as a race.
---
I am pretty sure those are kids from private servers and retail.
---
all i see here is a blurry picture taken with a phone, can you explain what i am looking at?
---
No the reason they are able to reduce the layers is because the population is starting to normalize. It’s been tapering off to hopefully what will be it’s stable consistent player base.
---
Read what?
---
Ouch
---
Kick has been so damn handy
---
Sap cross??
---
True, but can you choose to level lock picking? And if you do, does it take time to level it up? Do you need to Grind/farm chests, lock boxes, pickpocketing?
---
Sounds like a type of profession but unique to rogues :)
---
yet private servers existed for years
---
The page is 2 paragraphs and that is mentioned
---
The 2-handed animations for Night Elves are so cool.
---
FOMO
---
its not really 'catch up' gear tho its just another dungeon, albeit with some pretty nice loot. The issue with it releasing early is the absurd farming u can do in there, tribute runs by hunters can net 100G per hour once you learn it.
---
I mean, tipping is their choice.  If they'd rather tip than sit in town, that's entirely up to them.
---
And if being a prot warrior pays the bills, maybe more people would roll prot warrior, and the problem would solve itself.
---
Subscribe
---
I got mine the second time I saw it drop. But I've admittedly done like 10 guild runs where it dropped any way.
---
The default auction house UI sorts listings by current bid price, not buyout. People list with low bid, high buyout so theirs are at the top, hoping that someone in a rush will buy theirs without realising there's cheaper buyouts further down. If they don't sell, they cancel and re-list.
---
A lot of stuff in Thousand Needles blows as a warrior. The scorpions in the flats that give a five minute poison debuff, killing all hp regen, like what the fuck man.
---
This guy knows what's up.
---
nobody:
---
random idiot: the democrat party is actually center right
---
Found a tailgater lmao
---
Nice! That's nice to hear!
---
I'm just happy i don't have to farm that rediciulous healer trinket from brd anymore.
---
Blizzard clearly outsourced their first-level support to the lowest bidder. I've seen this type of response several times, and they never seem to actually understand the problem. Not good.
---
Skinning knife
---
According to this post, it's only effective 1/3 of the time.
---
Weird I screamed and won the Blackstone ring.
---
Sounds like it’s okay for no lifers to do something else while they wait. Changing plans to appeal to the top 1% never helped any game I can think of.
---
Ur bad
---
Cool. I don't think Blizzard should be catering to people like you personally
---
I remember transferring from pvp to pve a long time ago.
---
What add-on makes your character pane look like that?
---
:p
---
Min maxing in classic is stupid unless you are going world first. What the hell are you min Maxinc for? You will get invited everywhere and you will clear it all.
---
Thank you for your answer!

I was actually looking for Immersion and did not know the name!

Undercutter here. I always undercut by 10% or more. My stuff always sells.
---
I don't see it as ruining the market, quite the opposite actually. Competition is good, it drives prices lower, and lower prices = more supply = more mats for everyone = bigger economy.
---
&gt;I often refuse grouping when the target is humanoids cause i need my cloth for tailoring skillups. I've told people that and they've offered to give me the cloth that drops so i didnt mind joining forces. 
---
This is funny, because now you're an even bigger asshole wasting everyone's time refusing to group for kill x quests.
---
Great job. Extortion of people's time and selfish attitude. What a combo.
---
Level 41 hunter horde, and like 1 bar away from 42. Sort of sick of questing and SM., and can’t seem to find groups for RFD. Where’s a good spot to chill and grind a level or two so I can be ready for Uldaman? If it matters, I’m also a skinner and would ideally like to be doing that simultaneously to make some extra gold (considering I’m broke now after my mount.) Thanks!
---
are you a tank? when I am looking for a group as a tank there is \~50% chance they would do that to me. or someone whispers: inv, or let's make a group, invites me and give a group leader
---
Nobody said they should lol that’s why there are many games, because people like different things
---
Getting downvoted for speaking the truth, huh...that's reddit for ya
---
TOO SPOON. YOU HAVE RELEASED DIRE MAUL TOO SPOON BLIZZARD.
---
Look for Ulda groups. Any weapon you can get that's on-level will be better than WW Axe at 44, even considering losing the 5% crit and potential 5 weapon skill from being an Orc. Stoneslayer and The Rockpounder are both very, very good, and are available at 44. 
---
ZF's Chief's Enforcer is an okay upgrade.
---
If you can't get any of the above until you get into Mara, then Gatorbite Axe/Princess Theradras' Scepter are both good.
---
Dot instead immediate dmg, ravager is better for dungeons, no stats. Meanwhile executioners cleaver is a fifth the cost, has 23 are str (46 ap) and 1% hit. Kangs looks nice but it’s not worth the ah cost
---
Dang, you found the Mangled Journal? I've been looking Everywhere for that.

For dps you can use Details or skada
---
20g on my server. But I'm hoarding mind for P4 when there is more use for it.
---
just walk out of range. a lot of the nasty debuffs have a very short range, so if you just kite in a circle while fighting or are heads up to run out when they start casting, you'll be fine.

Swamp of Sorrows is good for grinding. The spiders along the bottom right of the map drop really good greys/spider silk and have a pretty good respawn. Was able to farm for my mount here easy.

You can still buy 151 proof rum, but Bacardi no longer makes it.  Cruzan produces a pretty comparable product.

Its amazing that your such an asshole to assume something and swear it fact cause you didnt read the conversation and just came to argue. I should have guessed given your trouble with simple math that your a fucking idiot. So I'll end this with a fuck you and have a shitty day.
---
My 48 Lock still has the dagger, but luckily a lock quest off hand that gives some more SP and int.
---
Discuss before hand if it’s a concern, but if no one does what you did is fine - by no means a ninja loot or anything. Whatever rules are mutually agreed upon up front are fine, even if that is everyone gets to roll.
---
If I enchant I offer to shard any greeds and either split them up, or do enchants with the mats after. Sometimes I just offer to split mats, but I get to keep a 1st pick. Whatever. It’s all negotiable.
---
Are we done now
---
WoW was already a MMORPG before servers were running at 300%+ of what they are intented to hold. Or didnt you consider it massive multiplayer when the servers maxed out at 1.5k players online instead of 15?
---
I would laugh my way to the leave group button if I ever found myself in this situation. Fortunately I’m friends with 3 really good tanks, one of which runs dungeons all day when we aren’t raiding so maybe my view is skewed but I have a handful of other tanks I met while levelling on my friends list too. There’s almost always a better option than paying someone to play their role in a group setting. Just ridiculous.
---
just made a warlock yesterday and got it to lvl 11 tonight! it's a lot different but still really fun- i did level in groups of 3 though so that def influences my opinion.
---
What game changing items? A trinket worse than Briarwood with a little FR on it?
---
My guild uses DKP and it's fantastic.
---
I was there in the raid. It happened. 
---
It was wild
---
How do you get one big bag? Is it an addon? If so which one?
---
They're already doing that, and we haven't even seen the start of it.  Better be prepared for pvp if you want to do DM on day one, because I guarantee people are going to try to stop you.
---
Lvl 40 undead priest looking for horde guild on Arugal / Oceania. 
---
Just keen to find some big brain players that are doing raids and pvp. Not that picky. Dead guild chat is a big no-no for me.
---
Yeah it is too soon. On the other hand I have 5,5k mana and water that regs 2,4k.
---
The pain is real.
---
Warlock are known to make hasty bargains of getting easy power for terrible price.
---
That ground looks like wetlands but those are red welps, I don't know what to think.
---
&gt; and you don’t get bought
---
I always make sure to tell the healer..don’t bother healing me from life tapping...I’ll just cannibalize and bandage for health.
---
I know the value of items all depends on supply and demand and its also different for every server.
---
But is there a general guideline to get an idea of an items value?
---
E.g. I picked up Dreamslayer recently from an SM run but I can't seem to determine its value using AH.
---
i just did ony and MC for the first time didnt even get anything and i play more than most im sure
---
Actually i think lp is a rogues call. I've been flamed for my view on this topic.
---
I was at Freewind Post in thousand needles running towards the lift. (Im a mage) There was an allaince priest sitting at the end of the catwalk... just waiting. I saw it comming from a mile away. I stopped and targeted him. He targeted me, and I knew. Then I made my move, I ran straight at him and blinked with just enough space to be on the edge of the lift, typed /wave and jump with slow fall. As I slowly floated down to the ground I hit my "lata" macro. I walked around Kalimdor with a grand smirk on my face for the rest of the day. 
---
For those curious....  Horde says 'I f ‚ f', Alliance reads 'l a t a'.
---
Too soon, yet blizzlike #nochanges
---
More interactive and fun than just 1 rolling it.
---
No, we're already playing a nerfed version of original WoW. No need to make it easier than it already is.
---

---
It's just up to the players to decide what's worth it to them.
---
Spend a few gold, but get loot/xp/gold (maybe even break-even on gold), or sit in town?
---
I'm not tanking or anything, but that sounds like a pretty easy decision if you're wanting to play dungeons and competition for tanks is high.
---
hell i even find priests overplayed , maybe its just bad times or server lol
---
haha thank you! that other hunter was awesome
---
Source please? I’m not saying that you’re wrong, but statements like that should be backes up by actual numbers. To me, lvl 40 sounds extremely low. The lowest level among my friends is lvl 56, and he’s been traveling a lot since release. I and my friends at 60 have full time jobs and most of us have significant others we spend time with. 
---
To me, it makes more sense that those in the 40’s and below are behind the average player. I don’t have real numbers to back this up either, just basing it on the fact that I know people that’s playing casually and are 60 and because Blizzard DO have real numbers they can look at. Since they are about to release new content, one could guess that they’ve looked at their player’s levels and come to the conclusion that the average player is just about 60 or will be by mid october. Which again, matches pretty well with what I’ve seen. 
---
You might be right and the average player is around 40 and I and my aquaintances are well ahead of the average player even though we’ve played very casually. But please refrain from stating your assumptions as facts without backning it up without something more tangible than a /who!
---
Are you guys competing in a stupidity challenge? What the fuck is wrong with this subreddit? That quote doesn't say, nor does it imply, that streamers called for content releases. Jesus Christ, I should've have to explain this. Use your head, actually think about it first.
---
Thats fine, I get that argument. But besides the fond memories of open Battlegrounds like Hillsbrad or Strangle, theres also the memory of instantly getting fucked all day long by flyspawn campers. Because in the end, thats what brings the honor in.
---
We live in a society.
---
Mages rise up.
---
Nice.
---
youre so casual it hurts
---
I'm confused at the very end it says warlock and paladin class mounts. Don't pally and locks already have there own mounts? Can someone explain what they mean by that?
---
they are good melee dps, just require substantially more commitment. The crit aura is very nice, and you can swap to off tank some mobs better than a warrior who is in half leather bis gear.
---
Your "shopping list" is close to 1000g on Faerlina. To each their own and all that good stuff, because I'm sticking to dungeons myself.
---
elv ui and extendedcharacterstats
---
I didn't know how much I needed to know the answer to this question until you asked it.
---
I'm hoping to check back later and find a helpful reply.
---
Why don't you LOS?
---
You write you just sit there waiting, instead start LOSing , plenty of places on the boat to LOS
---
These are freaking jumping desks and then some 😂😂😂 they need a fkin trampoline to work at that shit
---
Funny enough, it looks like the opposite is happening. Bliz is already rush-releasing Dire Maul and it feels like it's WAY too soon.
---
Yeah but they need to give streamers some new content to show the masses sadly. The average viewers attention span is far lower than that of the average classic player.
---
Thank you!
---
The other FP is actually really nice as a horde druid though. At level 60, a lot of content is in winterspring or felwood and the FP has direct flights there. It allows me to put my hearth in Grom'gol and port to the side of the world if I want.
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but did you guys really fight rag unarmed?
---
Being tipped or reserving orbs .ect is our payment for running this shit class, spending more on repairs and dynamite and being all but incapable of farming normally.
---
You can drop it. It doesn’t have requirements to have a certain level of a profession like the engineering goggles.
---
Truueueeee collooouuurrrrss
---
No surprises there.
---
Don't neglect spell damage. I don't believe Wisdom/Light scale with it, but Consecration and Holy Shield definitely do. Also, you're already grabbing int/stam gear, so it's not entirely unreasonable to get some extra spell damage in the mix.
---
Nice! A Soulkeeper. Decent weapon.

---
Instead of Bagnon try Inventorian it looks like it would be from Blizzard and has the same all one bag feature as bagnon.
---
Only need 300 to make it, not to equip it. Safe to drop after it's made
---
&gt;with ALOT of hours in queue
---
Your /played isn't affected by your hours waiting to log in to the server, if that's what you're referring to
---
Except Blizzard has said many times that DM was meant to give players better gear to help people who are behind on raiding.
---
This is so weird to me, how does it hurt you that DM is released?
---
Still sane, Exile?!
---
Say you were using a VPN. Do not say anything else. Even if the HWID is different do not change your story. You’ll be unbanned in a few days. Once you’re unbanned they will be watching closely so do not use power leveling again otherwise you will be permanently banned.
---
Hope it's a permanent one! Gz for encouraging Chinese mafia
---
You come off like a psycopath in this post. Im level 55. Im not an efficient leveler, but I’ve been sinking a TON of time into this game to the point where it’s annoying my wife and even my close friends who don’t play.
---
You’re in the minority for having a 60 toon AND a 55 alt. No matter how efficient you are, you are playing an ridiculous amount of time.
---
True dat. In Classic, I cleared MC at 56 with Resurgence Rod. However, DM offers a great alternative for non-raiders.
---
Rogue combo point finishers use the same animation. Very satisfying.
---
And those casuals will be looking for people to carry them anyway.
---
Herbs will always be in demand, because even casuals buy potions off the AH.  Mining...eh, depends.  Mithril might still sell, as will iron.  Thorium will not, if vanilla is anything to go by--I bought the thorium I needed to go from neutral to exalted with DMF at less than 2g a stack (gotta love Chinese farmers).
---
Just depends on how big the epic drop table is. If there's 20 epics that could drop there it would just be (1/20)^2*0.0001*0.0001 which would be 1 in 40,000,000,000 (40 billion). Or in reality this would be remarkable no matter what epic dropped twice, so the odds of getting any epic dropped twice off the same mob is 1 in 2 billion.
---
That's assuming what you wrote is accurate (I would expect the actual algorithm to be a bit more complicated but who knows)
---
Don't carry two sets of gear, it isn't necessary. 
---
Don't stress too much about armor ratings, especially if the new piece is increasing your stamina. It's nice to have extra, but unless you're a Druid tank, it's not necessary to go out of your way to look for extra sources of it.
---
What? By that logic all 55+ instances that aren't MC/Ony are irrelevant.
---
Thanks
---
People didn't really know the impact of Dire Maul in Vanilla so why does it matter now?
---
My wife does this, but she’s from Ohio? 
---
She did work in a strip club (bartender) when we met.
---
this was my first thought when they said the date, blizzard has lined up content on top of other MMOs for years now, no matter if its a launch or just a patch. Its like clockwork. I dont mind, if it doesnt get you to stay it gives you a reason to come back as soon as possible
---
How? That guy seemed pretty damn hostile to me
---
You can absolutely raid if you're a casual. You probably will have a tough time with AQ40 and naxx unless it's very late in the raid release cycle, but everything before that is totally doable for casual players
---
Like what?
---
While killing yetis in feralas I saw a 50 ud Warr struggling at 20% hp with the mob at 75% I cheapshot the yeti and save him then I went about finishing my quest then I logged out afk inside the cave for 10 minutes.
---
 
---
After I log back I see the Warr still struggling with the yetis and I feel his struggle and feel bad. I stand next to him and do /point at a yeti then at him and right click the mob so my char is in fighting stance. He proceeds to equip 1h and shield and proceeds to tag mobs and tank them while I mow them down for him. Took me 3-4 minutes to finish his quest for him and I gotta say seeing him understand me and equipping that shield really made me smile.
---
Good thing you're only qualified to work at McDonald's you pleb
---
shouldn't the boss be at 0 armor already?
---
Plus as later raids come into play, you get more wriggle room. In AQ stuff, you'll be able to have 440def, 8%hit, a bit of crit, and ample HP in the 'tanky set' itself. And the threat set will have a shit load more crit without losing much def/hp.
---
I'd rather be perma banned than waste time leveling to 60 tbh
---
Does the update mean any class can get the pally and lock mounts now? I'm confused what the update will bring.
---
Which way would you guys recommend a 60 Warrior, or a Lvl 51 priest make 40g in 1-2 hours?
---
Preferably without RNG since I just want the 40g
---
I'm with you here. My LPing is at 96 because I need to actually find chests to unlock. At my current 96, I'd need to head to hillsbrad and tangle with mobs roughly my level and risk aggroing multiple numbers of them and dying. The chests aren't all in one safe spot, I'd need to move around an area filled with mobs and this is just at 96, I don't know what awaits me further beyond. This definitely requires effort and going to areas swarming with mobs and enemy players, there's no buying bulk *anything* off the AH, except the practice locks which are relatively worthless by 80-85.
---
Skinning is leagues easier as the mobs you're grinding or killing for quests will ALSO allow you to raise skinning, in fact my skinning on my rogue is 157 while my lockpicking is 96.
---
Although looking at the post prior to the one I'm responding to, I take it you're of a mind that people should be more ready to share the skin. On that....I don't know. The skinner with the knife IS the only one with the ability to ACTUALLY skin it (and otherwise the mob would've stayed there until it despawned), but at the same time, the mob required the entire group to kill it and it wasn't a single person's effort that managed it, so.....no simple answer to this problem. I suppose maybe offer to sell to whoever wants to buy it for a 1/5th of the AH cost (the principle being that it took a team of five to down the beast)?
---
Sweeping strikes retaliation and cleave. Clear packs of 5+ with ease
---
This. A good warlock is used to being about 75-80% health most of the time. If we get into a situation, we have a healthstone and a potion we can drink on separate cooldowns. 
---
By all means, if you want to be nice, please do. But don’t feel like it’s necessary because we don’t have full health. It’s all good, we got it under control. And if not, they’ll learn the hard way.
---
Well put.
---
I don’t get it. Surely if you’re too lazy to actually bother playing the game why does a month ban matter? Someone else was playing the game for you anyway
---
I've never heard of anyone wanting others to pay for their water. That seems so dumb that it seems like a lie/exaggregation from your part (and if it isnt I'd be even more surprised).
---
If I am about to head for a dungeon run while not having a mage in the group, I just snag a random mage and buy 4-5 stacks from him for 1g. Makes it cheap.
---
I loved in vanilla the time between when Honor was introduced and when battlegrounds came out. There were so many raids going on. I was only like level 30 but I'd be in these huge groups raiding Splintertree Post and then running down into Sunrock Retreat and just pitting the town.
---
I remember running across Ashenvale and this Shaman turned and ran from us and I was the only one able to keep up with him with aspect of the cheetah and when I was able to concussive shot him enough for everyone to catch up, it was so exciting. Sounds lame now, but back then there was still a debate whether it was ethical for hunters to move in a duel or if they should get their 2 shots off and then resort to melee. It was a simpler time.
---
It just gets more sad...
---
Prob gonna make another account and pay someone to do it again. I make 100x the money power leveling cost in the time it'd take me to level. I want to enjoy the end game, not the leveling part which I did a few times 15 years ago.
---
Pro tip: it's not, and your meta lists and bEsT-iN-sLoT are bullshit that only the most tryist of tryhard guilds force adherence to.
---
You're not wrong. You just sound like a dick head because people are not as casual as you and it makes you feel bad. If thats an issue go play retail and worry about something else
---
You can run maraudon princess runs for 40g/hour atm. It’s not that hard
---
Gonna need a sauce.
---
Kek, you’re the saltboi who chased me halfway across Un’Goro with your rogue friend because I counterganked you 😛
---
I'm pretty sure every mob just ignores my war stomp
---
It's like real life professions. I play guitar, and when in a band, you would be told that 800 for the night is too much, because we are only playing for a couple hours. What they dont consider is the years learning to play, and all the rehearsal time.
---
This is why i love playing warlock &lt;3
---
Boy, that is a *massive* chip on your shoulder. Maybe you shouldn't be in here attempting to help people who know little-to-nothing about the game if you're going to get this salty about it?
---
Ah PvP. Plan makes sense. Keep an ear out for phase 2 date though. Probably going to be the best world pvp will get. So I hear anyway, not a pvp fan in RPGs myself. 2D style fighting games or FPS like Battlefield for my pvp fix, which is rare. Usually once a year.
---
Id just get an execs for an alt instead and that thing would last me into the 50s.
---
Until dm inflation or twinking will just need to hold or sell for lower.
---
I honestly don't get that circle jerk. At every point of my warrior's leveling I have felt strong-very strong. I don't even have much downtime between pulls. 
---
I guess I'm an experienced player and leveler so I know how to be careful and pull within my means and make sure to go to the proper areas based on my level. And if I do have a bad pull, I recognize immediately and hamstring everything while running away.
---
I didn't even buy boes?
---
40+ I can close my eyes and spam mortal strike. 3 mobs my own level is easy with sweeping strikes and whirlwind.
---
I'm not really looking forward to being 60 as a warrior but the satisfaction of feeling so strong while playing it keeps me leveling it over my priest/druid/mage.
---

---
It's a strange thing to do.  I can only imagine it was because there aren't really any good food or water options for level 60 players, and that was an oversight they didn't take into account so they're releasing it as a fix for that.
---
As long as their phase schedule going forward stays the same I'm kinda fine with it.  My warrior isn't 60 yet, but I honestly didn't want to be ahead of the pack anyway.
---

2 things.
---
Am I missing something? You said 16 chars. 2 of each race. Yet I dont see any alliance? And youre on PVP servers? What goes?
---
Second one. Sweeping strikes. Is it bugged? I feel like 30% of the time I use it, it doesnt hit the adjacent target. Any tips?
---
I honestly loved leveling a warrior. I even tried leveling as prot until lvl 33. Which was painful...
---
Id say both sides have their share of high levels griefing each other in stv. The great thing is we can choose to be on a pvp server or not.

Imagine you just ended a fight and you are trying to mount up. Someone arrives and silences you while you try to mount. Now youre locked out of shadow school and cant fight
---
They get epic speed vesions at lvl 60, but they take a long quest line to get.
---
Gets better around level 30
---
I think you have a very limited view point on the Situation. Tanks have to worst farming options but the highest bills by far. its absolutley ok to take Tips or even reserve things for you as a tank to mitigate that.
---
If you have some strange honor Codex or something thats fine but i wont tank unless its worth my time for me.
---
And if he goes to retail thousands will follow him too
---
Use the thing between your shoulders.
---
I'm sure a lot do that actually
---
I'm 2h fury at 60 and it really only works well if you have like close to 25% crit to keep flurry up. I think i'm around 23% unbuffed. It's great while living on the prayer for a dal rends main hand, but you really need the crit to sustain it. I also only use bloodthirst as a rage dump and focus more on wep dmg skills like ww and slam
---
Based on data extrapolated from watching mana regen the formula for mages is roughly 13+(spirit/4) per tick it’s not difficult to figure out if you look at the rate at which your mana regens.
---
Retailers on classic wow are people who are tired of how casual retail has become. All the casual retailers are still playing retail.
---
I got a pair of spider silk boots and I'm putting this on them.  Don't plan to replace those bad boys until I have my mount on my alt.
---
Good for you! 
---
Too many players are focused on what they can get out of a raid and a guild. Not enough people are asking what more they could do to help others.
---
No sense of humor then. Sorry man. Jokes aren’t for everyone.
---
Ouu Edgy.
---
This is all sorts of wrong! We need buffs to MC and Onyxia if anything at this point. We don't need DM to even further make the small portion of the players who are max level scale away further while also ruining server economies. This will not make any player catch up, like DM is intended to do, but just make the people who've pulled ahead pull ahead further and turn the divide into a chasm. 
---
What happened to it's a marathon not a sprint?
---
Make higher level stuff HARDER as it evidently isn't hard enough today if there's an issue with people clearing content too fast.  
---
This idea is shit, plain and simple.
---
I know im one of the exceptions. I hit 60 2weeks after release and had my epic mount 2 days after hitting 60. I had mining and sold everything from mithril to arcane crystals, did quests after hitting 60 (they give extra gold) and farmed dungeons. I play minimum 8h a day tho, now i have a 60 rogue with another epic mount , only this time i took herba isntead of mining. And i am steadily farming my way up to 1k gold again ( at 700smt atm).

---
4. Profit.
---
I keep saying just this. People complained about how in cata they never had to leave the city while they were perfectly fine with it in pvp since vanilla. When BGs come they should be like it initially was in vanilla where you had to go to the entrance.
---
Sorry to say. But cloth repairs are no where near the cost of repairing plate... And we get durability loss from getting hit all the time. While you only loose it on a bad pull. A good tank will also be using pots.
---
I literally dreamed about degaussing my screen last night, three weeks after reading your post. I don't really have anything else to add, I just felt compelled to share. The reminder of a bygone era seems to have rattled my brain so much that it had to make it the main feature of my night time cinema, and that's just plain funny to me.
---
You can't skin The Beast?  You don't get to roll on the hide.
---
If you decide to play druid, you are forced to either play as an emo twat or a cow.
---
Well congrats. I do not have a limited viewpoint on it especially since I'm a tank and I know how hard gold gain is but I also know that it's not hard to make gold by otherways then charging people to do your job. Maybe not super efficient but you're not in the negative. If you honestly believe this then you should tip DPS and heals.
---
You can’t summon within a dungeon you gotta run to the entrance, unfortunately
---
Because they literally said so.
---
There's a Gnome Mage on my server called Sitonmystaff, and has been since day one with no issues.
---
I hate working with these... *people!*
---
How does the release of a dungeon affect you? It's MORE content, xp and quests.
---
I suppose that would make sense, assuming your weapon just kinda gets stuck in them
---
That kills the entire world pvp phase of WoW tho. That was the most fun WoW ever was for me
---
Agreed, it seems to be a feature some people like to use without discrimination. Always makes me roll my eyes, especially when its prelude is an insult.
---
What does it mean 6 minutes until release, there is release button right there to click immediately. What happens after 6 minutes?
---
Right so all the casuals here are mad because???
---
I also do this if the price was clearly undercut, not even kidding. I never buy from obvious bank alts and will pay another 10s per to buy from a main
---
The amount of people that just open a fucking trade window while I’m in a city or Kargath is unreal, at least whisper me and say please not just “Gimmie” or silence with a trade window. 
---
I’m happy to give water/food, I always keep a reserve on me as it is inevitable. But if you don’t ask politely and use some fucking manners, you won’t get shit. 
---
It’s the one thing in this game that pisses me off, just opening a trade window in silence?! Sort ya self out fuck nugget...
---
Like talent trees in general being way more powerful because of Blizzard's balance mantra having always been "buff, not nerf." WoW went through pretty severe powercreep during vanilla. People have cited that looking at old MC videos shows people in dungeon blues doing 300 DPS while people in questing greens now are pulling 500 DPS. That's pretty damn severe.
---
SmokeCheese
---
I second benediction ;)
---
It's not that big of a deal as long as blizz still sticks to their phase schedule.
---
It is too soon though.  We were lead to believe classic was going to last a while.
---
Why do you want to get rid of the cool down animation?
---
Which only makes more players appear on your screen.  It doesn't change the status of the realm list.  Realms went from medium to high to full... even with more realms open and free transfers.
---
Most likely yes. The dev even mentions to brush it up.
---
Woah
---
i think the info will be to less, normaly they ban in waves so the day of ban wount help much because the range of 45-57 doesnt matter much and may also not be completly correct,
---
I got out of a dungeon with a lock that never went above 20% hp and never ate out bandaged. If 20% is full enough for you, it's full enough for me so he didn't get topped off and got 1 shot like 4 times bc obvs he's going to pull aggro
---
My son is 15. He rolled on Classic and I just play on his account when he is at school and putter around doing his auctioning and stuff.
---
I am looking for some levelling buddies on either faction for evenings and weekends. Don't mind if your new to the game or experienced, just someone who's chilled out and wants to have a laugh along the way.
---
I'm playing Alliance on Mograine EU but I would also like to roll new horde characters on another realm.
---
you are
---
Because I have cooldown timers and bars for spells I need to regularly see the CD for next to my frame
---
for a second I did expect another star wars movie trailer
---
There's no answer. Blizzard can't cater to everyone. At least I have an opinion though.
---
With two, three mobs it's more mana efficient to just single target cast, and much less of a risk of taking aggro
---
Anyone we disagree with is from retail!
---
Yes.  The tauren cat form is stupid looking.
---
This has to be a troll. Like why even quest in the open world if your feelings are gonna get hurt from a chest being swiped then you’re gonna have a rough time. It’s a brutal world out there.
---
That is the challenge.  It often involves kiting, using terrain, potions, trinkets, anything you can think of
---
If you mean the CD I believe in settings you can change it to show numbers instead. Or get an addon
---
Found the mage!
---
I use nugrunning
---
I mean all together
---
Assuming you mean things like models and such since we already have the ability to have retail graphics:
---
An option for it in the menu? Yes
---
Forced with no way of changing it? No.
---
What server pop? I can get a dungeon for anything pretty easily and I've also been 60 for a week.  DM is great for the current phase. So much of that content can be utilized noe but would be a waste later down the road.
---
No his karma whoring didn't work
---
just tell me what this comic is
---
Because when you duel druids you can RP a warlock.
---
Feat beast &gt; Big fat serpent dot.
---
I wanted some input on what faction I should roll, I’m going to main a warrior either gnome or orc, 
---
I want to do end game pvp and pve, I’m leaning towards ally because of their cities and pallys, on the other hand horde has wind fury totem, an easier weapon progression path and have better access to low level dungeons and dire maul,
---
Then why play the game?
---
Usually BN not except a handful of twink items
---
catch up to what lmao
---
This, we are back to the slippery slope argument already. If we have DM early you can bet people will beg for BGs early. While we are here the keyring would be nice! 
---
Keep fulfilling the demands of a few (streamers and 60s can’t be in the majority) we will be raiding Naxx by next year.
---
I had 2 years in my head for WoW Classic and was looking forward to it. With all the
---
Hell yeah gonna do that right now then thanks boys!
---
I haven’t figured out an add on that does that. I’m 99% sure there is one but idk which one it is. Bartender doesn’t. SUF doesn’t. Idk if elvui does or not but that’s a huge add on for something small and I don’t feel like reconfiguring it to suit all of the other shit I did for Addons because it took forever for me to figure out how I like it
---
damn sister. looking thicc
---
Effing Murlocs man...!! who knew they could heal O\_O !!?
---
You shouldn't have restored it and they could have probably done something about it. But hey, another blizz roast thread am i right.
---
Same here to all of this comment
---
For speed leveling the best race is nightelfs. 
---
Their wisp forms makes it faster for you to return everytime you die
---
i open with that when i can, it's very possible 
---
charge gets me 21 rage, a swing of my 2h usually gets me to 30(when not i sometimes pop blood rage at this point), activate sweeping strikes, pop into berserker stance and press my berserker rage and bloodrage if still up, occasionally i need to wait for another hit before whirlwinding. then pop into defense mode and pop demo while trying to get cleaves off as much as possible to utilize the sweeping procs better. 
---
there are still packs where you can't charge and there are packs where the dps mongs will just go straight in and really ruin rage generation because mobs arent hitting me but overall its a very viable opener for arms tanks
---
If you macro it and choose the blink logo rather than #showtooltip it should work. At work atm so can’t test it. I’m sure are other ways as well.
---
I never can grasp the cancer attitude people show here.
---
Irl must absolutely blow for them
---
How come no one is bitching about a phone capture on the one time it actually matters because it's difficult to read whatever information the fuck the OP was trying to convey?
---
&gt;WoW is a great game as long as you have something else to do when playing it!
---
Really ? Can you tell me what the macro is ? Cuz I’m not good with them
---
I'd like to quote Nelson: 
---
&gt; Ha-ha!
---
Hey,
---
I just downloaded Catalina, WoW Classic seems to be running fine but i've just been having a lot of problems with my installed Addons from Twitch. Most of them don't work and the ones that do have been causing glitches (health and mana bar top left screen being invisible for example). I hope they patch it up and update it soon, and  I know its the addons because when I disable all my addons the game seems to run fine. 
---
But to answer your question, yes the game runs fine. If you have addons installed you'll most likely have issues with that but the base game is playable with no problem.
---
What’s your point? 
---
Are you arguing for heirlooms or are you mad about people buying optimal gear for toons?
---
Yea, I wish these idiotic posts would be banned. Cluttering up the subreddit today. People will hop on the dumbest bandwagons. I dont know how this started or spread, but my first and only guess would be a streamer.
---
&amp; you mean don’t type #showtooltip? Cuz that shit confuses me
---
Same with spells and some mobs. Resist ist an ass.
---
BIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZARRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDD
---
For leveling my paladin, should I stick to two handers only or just use the highest dps weapon available?
---
to have fun at 60
---
ElvUI does have this setting.
---
I don't even fully agree with you but hot damn over a hundred downvotes is just insane for such a mild comment
---
Sleep well zzzz
---
This is when the DM content is most relevant though.  FR trinkets will get more use now than if they were to wait. There's a ton of really good blue gear that fills otherwise bad slots for many classes.
---
Transmog is forever :)
---
I know that’s what I said. But I don’t want to redo all of my action bars and health frames and target frames just for that
---
It took me hours to set up all the addons I have
---
Blaster not set to stun sorry
---
Your proposal is catch up gear to avoid missing out on something every casual has been working towards since release..
---
Do the people who aren’t 60 yet just miss out on a baseline server experience cause a few speedrunning players need more content?
---
then you shouldn't have rolled on a pvp server if you don't want to pvp
---
Honestly, some people would really benefit from learning to enjoy the game more casually. They probably got into it at some point in their life when they had a ton of time to spend and they measured their enjoyment compared to how far they were ahead of everyone else. That is however very destructive to other aspects of your life and you are suffering through insane grinds and burnout just for the short feeling of superiority.
---
It is the one constant since I came back to WOW for classic.
---
Anybody mentioning LFG DM  or  LFG VC  in chat starts the war right back up.
---
If you are playing classic, you knew this was a joke.  Unless you don't leave global/trade/city chat up.
---
No no no, jeez you guys are worse than religious zealots.  Once again the most important part is that all party members are on the same page. If that is established AND the item is super valuable like a Flask recipe or Warden Staff or so THEN all roll need because it's the most rational logical thing to do. 
---
NOT for a 2g green random item.   NOT when half the party rolls greed...   Please stop using strawmen
---
Big brain strat: ignore and blacklist entire server so you never run in to someone you don't wanna play with, ever.
---
Yes. The seller had 99% positive rating with like 100k sales so I trusted it, and in any case losing 4€ isn't going to bankrupt me.
---
Shit flows downhill mentality.  People get stepped on in real life, so they cope by stepping on others in a video game.
---
people who suggest to find a warlock to summon, you realize it takes 2 more people to channel the portal right? you think a warlock gonna bother to find 2 random to help with the summon? and even if he does, you think people gonna accept that?
---
i can't even get my party members to summon someone in the party because they are busy with watching youtube or someshit. get real lol
---
im sry that u feel a month+ to hit 60 is speedrunning ;/
---
Those god damn priest type mobs in STV. Even as a pally they are annoying. Gotta save my stun for when they try to heal. Auto them down to quarter hp just for them to heal so i can start the rat race all over again.
---
Just put /cast blink
---
This is me too dude, i’m 48 and also unemployed meaning I technically can play as much as I want. 
---
Even then, playing every day a few good hours i’m still not 50, this is way too fast.

Rule #1 of the PvP club: Don't whine about the PvP club.

---
“You’re playing on a pvp server, deal with it”
---
Jesus it takes you ~15 hours from 1-120? Do you dual log powerlevel or is that solo?
---
I’ll usually throw a regrowth and rejuv on myself to hopefully build up some aoe threat then I’ll try to save rage from pull to pull until theres nothing close nearby to pull or i just needed to use all my rage for whatever reason.
---
Wow that's really rude. I always ask if a mage would let me buy food. It's a single sentence, not hard and they know right away I'm gonna tip for it. Everyone wins
---
Skinners get skin, miners get ore, etc. I agree with you and your group just got greedy.
---
I already tried it still shows the cooldown
---
Ha get fucked
---
So ragnerous has 1.1 million hp(i think according to classic db, please correct if wrong) Divide by 25(dps) divide by 180(seconds to phase 2).
---
So ~250 dps per person to win before phase 2? Am I wrong?!?
---
Yeah, big time. Not so much in the scenery or environment assets (which only changed in Cata anyways), but mob and player models are a big one. On 10 graphics I notice the armor already looks a lot nicer than I remember lol, though still the old designs of course.
---
Man, I've tried to explain this to so many people. They all think I'm an idiot.
---
Too soon....
---
It's incredibly good for "serious" rogues if you can't see that who knows lol gg
---
they did change the status of the realm list
---
servers in the list now display as full as soon as 1 layer is full (they will change the display name for "full" to "layered" in this case soon)
---
but yes, reducing layers (2 layers is maximum now) will make you see more people, may also means there are less people on the server as a whole
---
Its been the case since vanilla WoW. It takes casuals on average 2-3 months to hit 60 - anything under a month and yes you are kind of speedrunning whether you admit it or not.
---
Solo, for like 97% of it.
---
What gives you 40g? Just vendoring greens/blues? I never really got into gold farming runs, and im at work so i cant youtube :(
---
Ffs I can’t unsee it now
---
Berserker rage doesn't break charm.
---
Followed by the Parry clank, and the block clunk.
---
Everytime someone asks for that, people state their personal pref, which always is either Classic+, TBC/Wrath, or endless Classic with no new content.
---
Leveled  a priest to 60 on a dead pve server. Now lvl 31 priest on a nice PvP server
---
Yeah lol screw that! The add-on way better enjoy it &lt;3
---
You're playing on a pvp server, deal with it
---
Or quit.
---
*laughs in shaman*
---
Bombs, armor, exploding chickens stuff like that
---
This is a fair argument but clearly there’s a level of game time required to be in the 99th percentile for achievement in the game. 
---
Game time and achievement are not perfectly correlated but they are to a large degree.
---
Those tar lurkers have a chance to disarm you on every melee swing. So AIDS
---
Thank you
---
He's talking about the ganker.
---
Late phases druid tanks will be more difficult. The need for manual crowd pummeled increases.
---
But they hold a lot of threat and are amazing off tanks. Every raid only has 1 MT anyways and 99/100 it's a warrior. The other 2 or 3 or in the air. Why bring all warriors to compete for gear? Bring a feral. The crit chance is nice anyways and you can spot heal certain bosses if needed.
---
Me and my buddy are all going druid tanks. And in fact on my server I see many more bears than restos
---
Elvui? i dont know
---
but if i use elvui id have to have a bigass addon running along side all of the addons i already am using just for that setting, and if i dont want to have all those addons running at once i would have to configure elvui for all of the addons i am using, which would just be a pain in the balls
---
Needed to make not to wear. If it was needed to wear there would be statements to this effect like the engineering stuff.
---
They don't think it be, but it do
---
Fun.
---
Because it happened to them.
---
Exactly my thoughts. I wasn't planning on playing archeage but after hearing this news today i went and preordered it. I play 4 hours a night on weekdays and 6 hours a day on weekends. I'm level 52 and was planning on hitting 60 by the 15th. I was expecting to get a good 5 or 6 weeks of MC before we received new content. If i'm playing 30 hours a week and it is still not enough i think it is time to move to something else.
---
Quel'serrar?
---
Ah ok. Thanks.
---
So OP, basically just sell the felcloth and buy the mooncloth on the ah. It's not worth your time to find someone willing to trade it. They'll likely just ask for the AH cost. To find someone uneducated enough to give you a huge discount would likely take longer than it is worth .
---
When mine is up, I immediately make a mooncloth and put it on the ah. Saw a dude spamming trade for 30 mins trying to get a CD. In that time he could have grinded the AH cut difference times 10 over probably.
---
DesMephisto on youtube and twitch, I just had a popular youtuber cover some of my leveling stuff, I also have a 3k member speed leveling discord if you're interested in that.
---
&gt;- Some boe's will plummet in price. Some people just bought boe's thinking they were bis for months.
---
There rating points you're referring to were put in for BC. Vanilla had the straight percentage but had they not changed it then add players leveled to 70 they wouldn't replace gear. Behind the scenes there is very likely a rating number for each thing but it's simpler to display straight percent.
---
They hope to make people go to reddit and cry.
---
I'm saying it's free honor to the people who come after the camper. The camped can go back to questing, the saviors get some free honor, and the camper gets camped.
---
Everybody wins!
---
I only play a hunter. 
---
None of the other classes interest me in this game.
---
If I were to create an alt it'd be a melee hunter just for fun.
---
Horde only.
---
Well, this is typical behavior for someone who has been bullied and stepped on in real life, projecting their anger and frustrations onto others. You see the same with male rape victims onto young and vulnerable kids.
---
There is a druid trainer in feralas.
---
Why are you even on trade chat if you get mad at haggling, a simple no thank you would of been enough instead of being passive aggressive
---
You're playing on a pvp server, deal with it.
---
Haha, my bank alt's name is tihsdaeh for this exact reason...This and HSBC was taken.
---
The specs on my comp. is sooo bad that the graphics I had during Vanilla was better anyways..
---
I love how everyone else rolled a 2, except you
---
To be fair, how many games are out there right now with that much depth?
---
If MC is hard for ppl then they are literal trash. This has nothing to do with sweats.
---
Theres 1 mechanic a boss that is easier than LFR and theres so much information about it.
---
I just stack spirit (and agi) on my huntard while lvling...makes it a lot easier, as all you basically use mana on is huntards mark until you get aimed shot.
---
cc gods? i have yet to meat a mage who doesn't instantly hit cone of cold before my first auto on any pull.
---
it seems streamers and scarlet monastery has ruined every mage on my server...
---
This person is asking the right questions!
---
While on this topic, does anyone have a link to a dagger spec that would be "good enough" in both pve and pvp?
---
clickbait
---
But as I got to a quest mob, an alliance member used /e to ask me to wait because he was first.
---
Fuck these guys
---
Yes, spending 8 hours a day playing as video game is unhealthy, sorry if that offends.
---
I mean...ideally as the tank you don't have to pop out of form to heal at all, but I guess I can see the utility in having the option.
---
When the rewards give nothing for time spent doing it
---
&gt; Skinning is leagues easier as the mobs you're grinding or killing for quests will ALSO allow you to raise skinning, in fact my skinning on my rogue is 157 while my lockpicking is 96.
---
get a lockpicking macro for your opener and it is the same.
---
My LP is never more than ~10-20 points behind because I Pp every humanoid and the drop training boxes.
---
You know yourself better than anyone op. Props to you for making a healthy choice.
---
as a newbish player, thank you and others that follow that example.  definitely awesome to get help when you realize too late that a quest you are doing is not for the solo player lol.
---
The argument here is that without the rest of the group, you weren't making it to the beast.  The group helped you get there and kill it so that you could skin it.
---
I heard about diremaul runs but I dont think I can 2 man it with prot warrior
---
#nochanges
---
Just FYI when pvp does drop 48 will grant honor to 60s
---
I had similar situation in LBRS today. I got FOUR belts of valor over 6-7 first three boss farm runs, plus a couple shadowcraft belts and one shadowcraft gloves and the beast stalker gloves plus a gift of the wild and a bunch of vendor trash and BOP trash. I’ve never won so many greed rolls in a row,
---
7 seconds add up but an hour and a half doesn't?
---
I like how you quoted yourself saying something completely different than what you said. Almost as if you realize you are the dope in this exchange and need to change how it occurred to fit your narrative.
---
Basilisks in the cave or gorillas, both in the southern part of STV.
---
I'd agree, I felt like I've been no-lifing it and can play while at work usually and am still just 52.  I'll hit 60 this week and think its way too soon for DM.
---
Because you have another dungeon to run? I'm not even max level myself and I really don't see the problem.
---
[Here you go m8](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7862)

Black sinew is also a very low drop from certain black drakes. And don't forget the blue sinew for the quiver.

Dank AF
---
I can relate so hard. Luckily things turned with dualwield.
---
It automatically releases you.
---
oh :(
---
Oh look. A post where you leave off the first part of the conversation and expect us to crowd around you in solidarity.
---
Already named mine Drizzt.
---
Forced him to become a ranger too.
---
Ashkandiiiiiii
---
Yeah I'm just saying the perception is always to blame the Tank when most of the time people undermine them anyway with healers pulling themselves and calling the Tank too slow.
---
For cat DPS it's replaced in black temple in TBC
---
A collection fit for a weeb
---
LBRS is also like 56+, but basically any group wants 60 unless its a tank. I don't expect people to actually level in there tbh. for majority of playerbase, it will be max level content.
---
1.12 itemization
---
Cool thank you!
---
I've always been in LC guilds, but my classic one is running dkp with LC on predetermined items. Not sure I like having to guess what others will bid, it's private bid, but it's only been a week. I'm sure it'll be fine once I better understand what things are worth.
---
Get this guy a Puppers

Because it's usually a form of addiction, and people have different strengths, weaknesses, self control, and tolerance when it comes to addictions.

&gt;Imagine my sadness if I do this and then the robe de-equips. Scoured the internet, can't find answer, although I'm sure it's out there. 
---
Thankfully it does not unequip after dropping it. Feel free to drop Tailoring as soon as you make it and do another profession.
---
Shoutout to the Undead mage who helped me kill lvl 40 elite at Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh when I was 35 and completely unprepared for it. Got me a huge dps boost for leveling.
---
Too bad theres no boat from Ironforge to Stormwind. Gotta take the tram and leave that footprint.
---
Ouh watch out we have a badass over here
---
It'll be interesting to see moving forward no doubt.
---
Too soon blizzard :(
---
Also when something resists your sheep spell
---
Try 7g repair costs
---
The ultimate yikes
---
Look up the stuff you need and only join if you can reserve what you need... Easy deal made.
---
Well i enjoy classic so far but can't see myself playing it that long. Also I don't think there will be any TBC servers.
---
I'm hyped for the new expantion Nzoth's ... and the new races coming out also having reworked classes and hopefully getting rid of the stupid necklace. Overall I enjoy retail for endcontent and classic for the leveling experience so getting 60 in classsic will lead me back to retail after a few weeks
---
Weep in lv 23 and still don’t got the gold for the enchant.  I would say that enchant pre lv 40 is bis as it cuts your traveling time
---
I’d rather it stay as is for at least another year.
---
What add on makes your equipped items look like that
---
Are you using SoC?
---
Man, I gotta rewatch the nightmare on elm street series, damn.
---
he was just mad that you used layering and wanted to feel better than you by making you scared of using layering to your advantage.  
---
When he realized that he was wrong he just ignored you cause in no way his little ego brain was capable of accepting defeat. /ignore was the only solution for this ape.
---
I returned the same quest today and got a 40s green so yea Lucky you :p
---
Yeah, Hemo is incredible.
---
When you roll alliance on shazzrah.
---
Nah that's what it's like to play wow in hard mode: Alliance.
---
Can you please explain why is it bad?
---
For me personally I waited years and years for classic, I dont want any progression.. I know quite a few people do want to progress to BC though so maybe they will make a server you can transfer to so that if you want progression that's what you will have to do.
---
But yeah for me classic should stay as close to level 60 and that content area as possible. There will still be BWL, AQ, ZG. Then PVP. I honestly dont like arena as I suck and therefore ranks appeal to me much more, hard work / grind = reward. Not only most skilled get the best gear.
---
In actual raids you solve that problem by using crowd pummlers, you don't need nearly as many as cat DPS, but keeping 5-10 of them in your inventory is really nice and guarantees that you'll pull ahead on ST threat no matter what your DPS players do.
---
Not a warrior but I have always been super lazy when it comes to macros. I should be running several to improve my life but then that means I have to make them. Plus, leveling wise, I really only use like 3 skills. Frost/earth shock and lightning bolt. If I'm feeling fancy I'll work in a proper flame shock.
---
Unrelated note. Found out today maras princess is basically immune to me. Still beat out the tank in damage using only flame/frost shock, searing totem, and some weak melee lol.
---
You could hire a mage to teleport you out.
---
Un’Goro crater has some nasty nasty debuff and made an already agonizing zone into something out of hell.
---
This has been a ongoing trend for years in retail wow. That’s why the game is pretty much dying now and has no replay value for hardcores.
---
Fun fact: recently after her original debut album got dropped from streaming services, she re-recorded it and released it again
---
Dude.... Those are both exactly the same... I think your Club only got one rules in reality.
---
My issue is that you needed the rest of the group to get there and kill it. Most other profession pike ups are not unique to the inside of high level dungeons, they can be found other places. Now I also think that without you or someone in your shoes it can’t possibly be acquired, and that has a lot of value too. I think two roles are in order. the first to see if it should just be folks with the ability to get it or the whole group and then a second role with the winning group members rolling to get it. 
---
The skinner would be rolling for it regardless of the outcome of the first role and we would still acknowledge the efforts of the whole and ability of the skinner. In most cases this mean the skinner would have a 50/50 shot as long as no one else could have done it and then worst case scenario they would still get to role against everyone with even odds if they lost the first role.
---
Hitting a 5 point, Cold Blood Eviscerate is about as fun as it gets.

Any fury warrior prebis in DM?
---
Also. Does this mean ill be able to duo farm gold.doing tribute runs?
---
The real fucked up thing here is that the guy is a warlock. There isn't even a way that devilsaur shit can become bound to him because he can't wear leather. It pretty God Damn obvious that this is not user error or a "simple misclick".
---
The post was [removed] what was it saying? :O
---
Items that increase your chance to hit by x% only have an effect on misses. I believe weapon skills are the only thing that have an effect on dodges and parries.
---
I logged out at the spot. And as I logged in now, the parchment was there. 
---
So it either takes some time to spawn or spawns randomly, idk.
---
The Fish for FAP? Idk
---
A wave hit it? Is that unusual?
---
It was heavily dependant on server. Some called it DM and some called it VC. Neither had issues distinguishing them because no one ran all wings of Dire Maul at once anyway, so there was always a wing attached. DM/VC, I don't care what you call it, it's just cringy when people get mad about it.
---
Does it matter how many A's you write?
---
And ORIGINAL release date: November 23, 2004
---
Why are you cherry picking a regional release date to make a point when the patches and development leading up to DM release was done in America for months?
---
server transfers are gonna cost at least $15 might as well just stick with your new rogue
---
You can just catform and stealth to the bosses.
---
I do that whenever I believe the item in question might be useful to someone, not that I care about money in a video game anyway.
---
How do you map "SV" to that spell? So you have to hit S + V to cast it?
---
Kill that bloke in SFK.
---
He’s in the locked cell next to the guy who you free to open the door.
---
I remember this scene in Reservoir Dogs.
---
Skinning knives don't count as weapons in ability calculations for some reason. When leveling my hunter, I sold my weapon for some copper and to save a little inventory space. I ran out of ammo and tried using raptor strike only to see "must have a melee weapon in main hand." I had to go back to the level 2 mobs to either get enough copper for ammo or hope for a gray dagger or axe to drop.
---
I got this thing back in 2007 a few weeks before tbc released. I also had the epic chest from brd and this ridiculously fast gun. My hunters name was (translated) “Minidwarf” and I ruled alterac valley. God, I was a lucky kid at the age of eleven.
---
Yeah pretty much just CoR, but it's enough
---
I have played retail for ages and also dipped in PServers, I know my quest route. Also I play a Warlock. I don't like to waste my time while leveling so I'm taking the fastest route. Also I'm good with 6 hours sleep/night and got up between 4 and 5 am pretty often to do 2 hours of super efficient questing. So stop judging me dude, I even squeezed in 3 times sport / week. Just get better at time management.
---
Is it true Dire Maul adds a ton of gold into the economy?  I’m currently sitting on 25 stacks of Stonescale Eel and was wondering if I should wait till next week to start putting them on the AH.
---
why cant i get useful epics? i had level 46 spirit mail gloves drop for me twice. AH price on them were 12g but no one is buying. fuuuuu
---
elv ui
---
OOf
---
Hey I’m the mage he was camping. I figure out that I just go in the water and I can kill him as a level 44 mage lol. He’s so bad it’s unfortunate really
---
It’s not like they can do anything to you
---
shift+v
---
Same question as above. What kinda reset do you mean? Raid reset level reset ban reset tax reset inflation reset I can think of many... /s
---
I feel like dual wielding helps so much, but the sword from Morgan Landimore has much better stats at my level
---
Before I lay my hands on BFA again I would rather stop gaming at all?
---
Ya I pet tanked cath and we didn’t have this issue at all... maybe you guys are low for the zone?
---
So holy nova is really the trick there? Good to know. I‘m only 38 but want to get that staff too at some point :D
---
Its the circle of life and the only reason why pvp servers exist.
---
Get killed in unfair fights (2v1,higher level enemy...)
---
Kill others in unfair fights.
---
Very very rare to have fair fights on pvp servers
---
Well it completely changed my valuation of raid items. My guild runs dkp. I previously had 4 items ranked as max bids, now I only have 1. As a holy priest, there are 5 major upgrades in DM. 1 is even BIS. The others are so close to BIS that it devalues me using a lot of dkp to get them. 
---
Also I don't have half my preraid BIS yet. DM coming out changes my dungeon priorities and drops a couple of them compleyely.
---
... So in a way it does.
---
&gt; Just wanted to know on which pet skills to focus and why (like armor or health) or stuff.
---
For just leveling, i would pick your usable skills (Bite, Claw, Dash, Growl), get those, max armor and slap rest in stamina. I tend to bind dash to my pet attack and stop attack macros, so it will run to and from the mob faster. In BM with focus regen talents (havent tested in classic), you should have enough focus just to keep bite, claw and growl on autoattack, if not make a another key for claw that you can spam. It might be that this doesnt really make a huge difference anyways.
---
*\[Laughs in Earth Shock\]*
---
You mean like a mage getting paid to power level dungeon groups? How about a hunter or warlock charging for princess runs? What about entire guilds full of people charging for raids loot runs? Are you seriously saying no one should offer a paid service in an MMORPG? You just sound like a salty communist tbh
---
This is me on my rogue except nobody wants anything except lockboxes opened. Some guy was specifically spamming for non-rogue dps after I said I was LFG.
---
Supposedly they fixed caster pets but when you have 2 wind serpents the same level one(that used to be a caster) and one that has never been a caster even though the stats are the exact same the caster pets still appear to have like 1-2 dps less when you hover over their dps. Does anyone know if this is true all the way up?
---
The Deflector? It's from UBRS, Drakkisath.
---
Ive recently changes servers also... leaving behing a 56, 30ish, and 2 20s... heartbroken but on my way up level 33 now. So its up to you.. but u should play what you enjoy the most. My opinion is level your rogue and have fun with it!
---
That's why I'm not leveling a warrior right now. I'll focus on my main until I'm at a point I can Semi-Twink a warrior to 60
---
Wow such an elite elite gamer! Please teach us all you friendless virgin guru.
---
Bear tanks don’t need to build rage, especially not for swipe. You should only be using swipe to dump extra rage. Demo roar and thorns is plenty to keep off the healer for the pull and a few mauls and you can switch to the second kill target. The initial pull of the run and any pull you have to wait for healer mana you can pre-hot for some extra threat, but you should be pooling rage at the end of pulls to use on the next one.
---
as if heals and tanks get nothing from running an instance. what i get for giving out food for free is, even more people asking for free food.
---
What is the logic behind this when needing on a green upgrade for you is 100% okay? Yeah you need it but everyone else could put it on the AH or vendor a soulbound blue worth 7g. You're saving money by needing on an item you could just buy from the auction house. This even applies to blues, you could just buy them from the AH (for 800x the vendor price). That train of thought is ridiculous and no one applies it to gear when it's exactly the same for materials.
---
Essences of Undeath go for like 60s on my server, and I've never ran into anyone that gives a damn that I've needed on a few of them. You make more money vendoring your average grays which also drop more often in dungeons.
---
If its worth more than a few gold its reasonable to expect everyone to roll similarly on an item as the value of the gold outweighs a potential upgrade. Righteous Orbs from the same dungeon for instance. We're not talking about Edgemaster's Handguards dropping. Don't know why everyone is so indignant about some low value materials.
---
But for real: the number of priests spamming flash heal and greater heal and being oom 40 seconds into the fight is pissing me off.
---
Im a goddamn resto shaman and I have better mana control than every priest ive encountered.
---
55 runs for ravager, never got it, I out leveled armory....
---
The mace and sword dropping in Uldaman are pretty good. And after that, you should look at the mace or axe from Maraudon (rotgrip and princess).
---
Honest question, how does the release of DM 7 weeks after launch (it was 14 weeks 15 years ago btw) affect you as a casual player in any way, shape or form?
---
i mean they can do like all the other classes and pay for it.
---
Woah, looks like someone's trying to act tough. Better watch out everyone, this guy doesn't ignore people.
---
no thanks... i want my fucking class mount.. its bullshit we cant get our mount because of DM.. not fucking waiting 6 months to get my epic.
---
The alligator boss in maraudon has a higher weapon damage ax then ww with a chance on hit to apply a bleed
---
I grabbed "Lava" on a high pop pvp server for my shaman yesterday 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
---
Yes THIS. I can't bear to play horde druid because I can't even with the mouth-breathing, broken-jawed cat form.
---
For holy priest it looked to have a BIS belt and 3 or 4 other items way better than other preBIS. Some very close to MC BIS items.
---
Also I saw a lot of interesting tailoring patterns, like 24 slot enchanter bag, good +shadow gear...etc. There appears to be a ton of reasons for me to chain run these for a few weeks. 
---
Unfortunately every guild healer will want in and we dont have nearly enough tanks to support the demand. We run 2 raid teams, 10 healers each. We maybe have 5 tanks/alt tanks in each group. I just hope there are lots of good tanking items in there to keep them interested.
---
This is perfect. That means that all the raw Gold farms are available and the economy can finally stabalize and I'll make some Money off all the things I have :3
---
Also IDC if it is too soon. Who is to tell that? People are so far apart Progression wise...
---
&gt;It's not that big of a deal as long as blizz still sticks to their phase schedule.
---
Well, they are not. Phase 1 was supposed to be DM and Honor system. Now its only DM, they literally broke their phase schedule at FIRST PHASE. They CANNOT remove layers in big servers without 5-10k queues and thats what they promised to do at when honor system launches.
---
Do they think, that releasing DM early will help ? Or waiting few weeks, delaying honor system update will fix the server population problem ?
---
No problem! I kind of over did it now the market on my sever is a little retarded. 12s per ore..... guess phase two is farming it myself and selling it for 10s lmao.
---
I've been level 60 for ~2 weeks now and I have been logging on less and less, leveling alts and such while I wait for the rest of my guild to catch up so we can run dungeons together. Maybe this is the kind of behavior they are seeing and interpreting it incorrectly
---
Its not the worst assumption to make. But those people miss out on some of the fun imo.
---
Orgrimmar guards: "gratz"
---
I'm not a Paladin.
---
Tanks are kind of like waiters, they rely on tips to be 60-80% of their income to have liveable wages relative to the rest of the population.
---
There are dirt 'spots' on the ground which you can just pick up.
---
All the angry capitalists in these comments.
---
The game has been out for 6 weeks now? Assuming most of the hardcore guilds started raiding already in week 2, that's 5 resets. two epics per boss, ten bosses + 3 epics from ony. That's roughly 100 epics from MC, and 30 epics from ony (assuming they got two resets per week on ony).
---
130 epics divided by 40 is 3.25, so on average the absolute most hardcore guilds have 3.25 epics per player. That's without considering most hardcore guilds have loot counseling for a lot of items, especially tanking items.
---
The amount of 60s wearing most of their tier 1 sets is actually extremely low. Keep in mind if you see one or two, that's probably the most geared player in a top guild and extremely lucky on top of that.
---
crossrealm makes it worse as there is no reason at all to pick the underdog
---
as much as people dont like to hear it: non crossrealm helps balance out factions.
---
Warlock has an easier time than mage when it comes to mana so you probably should consider that.
---
#whoosh
---
I’ve had a private conversation with OP and he’s already unbanned. Hilarious that you guys get so upset over this sort of thing.
---
Bears are actually better at aggro then warriors. Doesn't change the fact that dps jumping the gun pulls of any tank in the game.
---
I mean I've sold probably 20 of them so somebody is buying them haha
---
Pre bc Patch was 2.0 not 1.12
---
What racial is this?
---
You’re pvp server on deal, play with it.
---
Uh... What? This is a screenshot.
---
Holy shit lol! I'm gonna do that!!
---
***whoosh*** the ***whoosh***
---
Wait, you guys getting paid?
---
Idk the name, look it up.
---
Looking forward to catching your stream man.
---
I play a warlock and I’ve never had an issue with druids, but watching you, all I could ask myself was, does he ever die? Lol.
---
Great video man!
---
Isn’t grobbulus the bigger one? Ironic
---
But most people came to play classic and most are toxic against anything that isn't classic so how do you  get new content without driving away all people that just want classic ?
---
Also Classic is still new lets come back in a few months and see how things change with the new xpac coming out. 
---
Until then i enjoy my classic leveling or at least until i get 60 then i rather go play retail instead of starting to raid.
---
You are so right. I'm a tank at 53 and I started to figure this out 10 levels ago. I do dungeons for 2 levels and then go back to the areas my friends were questing for the span of those two levels during the day. Its the only way to keep up. Its bad enough tanking with shitty rage gain, no reason to bring that problem into questing.
---
No content is being removed. I quit at the end of wotlk and no instance had been removed at that time. With phase3 comes BWL and guilds will still do fast MC runs when BWL is out, which probably will take minimum 3 months, probably closer to 6.
---
Idk if you’ve noticed, but if you’re behind the wave then it’s exceedingly difficult to run dungeons.  My guild was just talking on our discord about how they can’t seem to find dungeons for their alts in the 17-35 range.
---
Now a dungeon intended for people to catch up gear is coming, and will do the same for people who wanted to experience BRD/Ony/MC.
---
People will always do ony and mc.
---
its not gonna be old school AV, theyre releasing the rush version :D
---
Could you share the exact build? I might start a warrior. Including the order? (I use bobo-talents[bobo-talents](www.bobo-talents.com))
---
(Not the person you're replying to) I actually thought about doing this, but I was concerned they'd have a valid case to bring before a GM.
---
The tank doesn’t need any loot and wouldn’t do the run if he wasn’t making money. How is that any different than a high level mage who doesn’t need anything from zf running a group through it for payment?
---
It's simple. He can, you can't. You chose the wrong faction and now you're his bitch. Come phase 2 this is what all zones with players 48+ will look like because in phase 2 players that arent 60 are now the NPCs people grind off of.
---
&gt;Casuals will feel behind like I felt when I played Vanilla well into its release.
---
The thing is casuals will always feel left behind because Vanilla WoW progression never catered to casuals. That was one of the reasons why Blizzard made things simpler and faster, to cater to casuals. Think about it; the life of Vanilla was about 2 years long. Back then people were even slower than they are today due to it being most people's first MMO. Add to that poor internet and hardware and you have the majority of the playerbase that didnt even step foot into raids, let alone AQ or Naxx. You can't say that Blizzard is releasing content too fast for casuals to experience Classic because catering to casuals was never what the Vanilla experience was about.
---
I went into razorgore EU when the Gehennas queues were too much in release.
---
Not me. Other people are.
---
Depends on the group composition. If you are a warrior tank with a rogue, hunter and another melee dps. Probably better off with that warrior tank for the close to no downtime.
---
Not saying prot paladins are bad, i just think warriors are in general better.
---
As a mage i like prot paladins, since their drink time lines up with mine mostly.
---
Look at this logically. All instances are called by their name, DM/VC is the only exception. The reason some servers May have called it VC is because when Dire Maul came out they wanted to differentiate them.  DM was obviously what Deadmines was called first since Dire Maul came out much later. Why would it have been called VC over DM when Dire Maul didn't existed.
---
No...not at all. It's pvp in a video game. Shit happens.
---
Shadow priests too!
---
I have no issue making money outside of accepting tips
---
There's a meaningful contribution to the debate!
---
If it’s red it’s dead
---
/salute
---
I believe it's similar to the locked chest dilemma. Both parties are correct, but I think it's up to the circumstances.
---
Do the skinner needs it for the item or just wanna  sell it for profit?
---
Does he states this purpose at the beginning?
---
Is there anyone else who can do it besides him/her?
---
And finally: How easy to replace the said player?
---
I do believe if it's communicated in the beginning than it won't cause much problem.
---
finally some good hunter loot.
---
The response is obviously for OP
---
What a riveting tale
---
I'm gonna come out and say it. I've now leveled to almost 50 as a warrior once and almost 40 once, I've done almost no dungeons on either characters so gear has been scarce for both characters and I've gotten none of the important weapon upgrades.  
---
  
---
I did get the cyclonian axe at level 40 on one of them but at that point it wasn't THAT amazing anymore and all in all it just slowed me down to do the quest.  
---
What I am going to say is, playing a warrior is not hard. The only hard thing about it is that many other classes can gank you somewhat easily. It's even easier to level as some other classes, sure and you have some downtime occasionally but if you do the right quests, use a ranged weapon when needed and shield slam macro to interupt spells it's pretty smooth.  
---
I do see a lot of warrior corpses though and all of em are from people who do quests, 3 levels higher then them, don't interupt spells and who sometimes manage to pull two at a time because they always pull with charge.
---
Well lonely is my guess
---
challenging shout on cd
---
Get a blacksmith to craft an immune to disarm on your weapon
---
&gt; The only trick to warrior is taking heroic strike off your fucking bar
---
when you Q heroic strike your offhand hit penalty disappears.  
---
meaning if you dual wield and use HS your offhand will hit almost every time.  
---
this normally generates enough rage to keep Qing HS until the mob is dead. hardly any misses.
---
go dual wield and spam HS exclusively. thank me later.
---
PS: if the mob is way below your level play like you normally would with BT, but never WW.
---
Its funny cause i got one dropped yesterday
---
True, I was just offering insight on why people would rather not play than tone it down. For some, the game isn't fun when you're playing casually
---
Guilds that farm Naxx every week will go back and do MC, at least half way through. Itemization and loot availability in vanilla was such that a guild needs to run everything to hope to have everyone geared up. Gearing 40 people with 2 drops per boss when slme of the items are useless is tough. Everyone runs everything every week if they can help it. Don't worry.
---
I only met one person who ignored me back during vanilla, and he simply whispered me to tell me I overpriced something I was trying to sell, so when I mentioned it was the price I saw in the AH he said something to the effect of 'whatever idiot' and then stuck me on ignore.
---
I considered logging in to an alt or making a new character to whisper him again but decided it just wasn't worth the effort.
---
I'm not too much into grinding the same game again. I ended up buying BfA after I was done with lv60 dungeons and have enjoyed it so far. As I've done some effort getting the casual LFR/LFD stuff up, I'll surely check the next patch content too. And visit classic too for some DMs when that's out. No reason to hate one, both are cool.
---
Or when fking rock golems... creatures made from boulders dodge 3 attacks in a row. How nimble is that shit?
---
Agreed
---
???
---
Confirmed
---
Yeah, did he call his dad that works at blizzard?
---
That's fine, nobody is forcing you to do anything :) 
---
on Gehennas the only truly expensive stuff is the Devilsaur set, and personally I'll probably end up with Voone's Vice Grips and some random pair of leggings instead, but I still wanted the list to be as close to the original BiS in terms of stats as possible.
---
As an example of the prices I'm looking at personally:
---
Heartseeking Crossbow - 11g
---
Shin Blade of Agility (or an equivalent with 26-28 agi) - 5-20g. 
---
Tattered Leather Hood - 35g
---
Black Dragonscale breastplate/shoulders - jumping involuntarily between 50 and 100g, catch it on a good day
---
Black Dragonscale boots - usually 75-100g if you buy the boots and not just the mats. 
---
Beaststalker's Bindings - 2-3g
---
Serpentine Sash - 10-12g
---
Innervating Band - 30-80g (usually see them expire unless they dip below 60g, so people often just pop them on for 40-50 for a quick deal).
---
Without the devilsaur set that makes for a shopping list of maximum 461g if you can't patiently wait a few days and play the auction house game (not impulsively buying stuff right away if the price doesn't match what you want to pay).
---
The devilsaur set is expensive as all hell if you buy it from people on Gehennas, but my guild is sabotaging the devilsaur mafia there, so I'll probably end up paying the cost of the other mats + 5g per devilsaur leather for the items.
---
That's only for the tar lords though. The ones a bit lower at 52 don't have that debuff.
---
I remember that tiny heal saving my ass tons of times
---
I never even heard someone mentioning tips on my (German) Server. I'm tanking since the start, where's my gold??
---
But seriously. It's the job. Healers have a hard time too. And it's fun to run dungeons with good DDs.
---
No bgs until p3.
---
Today is literally the first time I've heard the term and I only played vanilla.
---
Because I live in Europe? DM was available looong before most of us were 60 in vanilla.
---
Yeah this reason alone is why I didn’t even bother logging in yesterday.
---
Seems to be a game full of failures, that think because they have the whole day to waste away they are somehow superior to others.
---
No, fellas.
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
**Overpower**
---
&gt; Instantly overpower the enemy, causing weapon damage plus 5. Only useable after the target dodges. The Overpower cannot be blocked, dodged or parried.
---
&gt; cannot be blocked, dodged or parried.
---
IT SURE AS FUCK CAN MISS THOUGH.
---
This is how I always played my lock; my research and knowing the Burning Legion would return were way bigger concerns than 20 year old grudges.
---
My hunter has Mana and can res his pet. Checks out
---
Regeneration: Health regeneration increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.
---
I think human swords you need 8.
---
think of it like this, if you could run around a playground and just punt kids left and right would you?  maybe yes maybe no but it would probably still be fun as hell.
---
People are going to do MC for next 1-2 years.
---
All your replies, big yawners, keep typing though, I wanna fall asleep
---
I think what you are describing is a pretty safe bet. I'm seeing exactly the same thing in my guild where a player is far more higher level than all of the guild and is now 60 but waiting for us while trying to get into ubrs/lbrs as a rogue
---
Fucking traitor. Red = Dead.
---
Back in the day when TBC was around the corner all i wanted to do was pull the break. STOP! Im not done yet.
---
I've given up on CC-ing unless asked for (or that first stupid pack in Scholomance) because it *always* gets broken. Usually by the tank.
---
So we cater to those that play on a pvp server?? I haven't played wow since BC and play on a PvE sever (same as I did back then). BGs are what I wanted from the start. 
---
For your other points, man I dunno what to tell you. Im 60 with a good portion of my bis and we are doing are first MC run this weekend. Over 200 60's on my server (was a low pop server released a week after launch) and now high pop at peak.
---
2 years is insane and unreasonable. Yeah back in 2005 2 years was a thing. But back then we didn't have the amount of knowledge and wisdom available now. Most of us know exactly where to go and what to grind. Back in vanilla fucking basic broadband internet was still in its infancy and wowhead or all the other knowledge databases didnt exist. Not to mention the lack of mods.
---
You know as a classic player exclusively, I am so sick of this comparison people make. Back then I was a dumb fuck kid who didn't know what the fuck to do. As a full fledged adult I can maximize the time I have. 
---
I mean seriously, 2 fucking years with classic alone. There are several guilds on my server with mc clears and nax clears and you are looking to squeeze 2 years from this with the knowledge we have now??? It's cool man, take your time and there will be plenty of people doing the same you can tackle content with, but all this over DM is over the top.
---
At the end of WOTLK the original Naxx40 was removed.
---
&gt; I don't remember this being a huge issue back when Vanilla was live.
---
Nobody knew shit when the game launched. The economy inflated gradually. I sold a stack of briarthorn for 1g50s when I was leveling my alt late vanilla. Go check how much it costs now.
---
why is it so hard for fully grown humans to tolerate someone else not wanting/being able to enjoy something in moderation? i never log on if i know i cant play for at least 2h, kills the immersion and doesnt give you many options as to what to do ingame during that timespan
---
So you weren’t as good as you thought, like all tanks that come here and complain
---
It's the lvl 57-58 elites (Cobalt Mageweaver) dragonkin :D They do indeed pack a punch, but they should be doable for warlocks and hunters with no issues :)
---
Ive stop counting, one time i had Gorosh 3 times in a row, dropped boots everytime. Ive had so many mages/warlocks come and go because they have gotten their belt in like 4 runs.
---
I dont know about the chance of getting Gorosh but it does not feel equal, ive seen Grizzle/Spider so many times. Gorosh and the Worgen feel alot more rare with my data.
---
Yeah I work 9-6, would’ve hit 45 yesterday but didn’t bother logging on
---
Nice enchant
---
It's just two people, they are rolling between 1 and the previous roll, first person to roll a 1 loses and pays the agreed-upon amount.
---
Why? Just buy it and make a fortune on his mistakes.
---
I actually thought Gnomeregan had an excellent design.
---
Then however in the same run (the first run) I thought actually this place sucks. It looks nice for a while, but then you get sick and tired of it real fast.

This is the video  [https://twitter.com/Jelx\_/status/1181459032596533249](https://twitter.com/Jelx_/status/1181459032596533249)
---
&gt; 70% of the gold comes from selling items to other players
---
And they get it from were? You realize AH transactions actually remove gold from the economy, right? DM is the one thing actually pumping a ton of gold into the economy.
---
alliance scum as per usual. yall are the US of the gaming world
---
He straight up said right there it was affecting his social life negatively. There’s not much point in dating someone that doesn’t want to spend time with you.
---
No it was at the beginning of Wrath, not the end that Naxx was moved to Northrend.
---
Once the pvp trinket comes out, Warriors will start to munch on Rogues, too. Overpower crits plus popping out of the Kidney Shot when it drops will be too much for most of them. Combined with demo/piercing howl, rend, and deep wounds to break vanish, they won't stand much of a chance.
---
Not a quest, just kill kobolds in goldshire. They drop a throwable candle you can farm which paladins can use as range pull.
---
meanwhile, at lvl 27...
---
You deal with percentages. So a 25% increase of 50% equals 62.5%. Which means after talents your offhand now suffers only a 37.5% reduction in damage versus 50%.
---
Instead of deflecting how about you just address the point I made. Paying a tank to run your group through an instance (when they don’t need anything from it) is the same as paying a high level mage to run your group through zf for exp/loot.
---
Do you know of any sick spot to grind solo? been trying to do the elemental in Silithus but they're not dropping anything decent
---
it kinda should make them superior in the game sense if they put in more time to be better than someone who plays for 2 hours a day don't you think?
---
Anyone who opposes this is clearly not in the need for proper mage water.
---
ogre magi staff? libram enchant?
---
DM will still be there when you get to 60
---
Ploop is like the sound when you poop and the water splashes back onto your butthole
---
Classic has been out for 2 months. If you are not LVL 60 you are doing something wrong.
---
Now you're an edgelord.
---
*Darth Maul
---
People who enjoy the game wont stop raiding MC, just because they've gotten their gear.
---
Most will have alt guild runs and bring randoms to fill the missing spots.
---
I'm planing to make weekly MC PuGs and MT on my alt, while raiding the next tier raid dungeons on my main (and do Ony each lockout for bags).
---
Why are you playing then? Also the bulk of the playerbase isn't even 60. The content is most definitely not need right now for anyone but ultra tryhards. Classic has limited content to release, they should be expanding its lifespan as much as possible.
---
When in the options, just click on the panel that you want to customise. It should tell you at the top left ( I believe, sorry I’m not on the computer)
---
I go into every dungeon telling the healer to let me know if I’m taking too much damage for him to heal and I’ll switch to sword n board. 
---
Not once have they complained. You must either be a terrible healer, seen one or two terrible warriors and just generalizing, or just extremely whiney.

Day 6. 500 DPS.

---
When they do this I'll drop in a couple stacks of the rank one stuff. You'd be surprised how often they tip before realizing what happened.
---
&gt; This is actually not true. The two dps Warrior stances should have a built-in 0.8x threat multiplier, which means they need to generate 1.25x threat to pull instead of the ranged's 1.3x threat
---
AFAIK it's the other way around, and the defensive stance has a built-in 1,1 threat multiplier.
---
I pay 50s every time I bother a mage for water, but expect 3-4 stacks in return for it or I'll cancel trade. I've never had a mage complain, I also ask to buy the water.
---
If they give me 6 stacks I give them a 1 hour spirit and fortitude buff.
---
:) its nice to see you again btw
---
DM gear is not that good. I might be on the extreme end of the spectrum but the whole dungeon offers me one side-grade. There are some decent upgrades but nothing too crazy.
---
Well the tank is not a damage dealer so yeah, good job on beating him in damage I guess?...
---
Archeage unchained is comming out October 15th and blizzard did this to try to shove them off.
---
yeah but they're priests, us druids are there to give them extra mana bars so it's k to spend it on high heal per second spells and doing 40% over healing.
---
Meanwhile I'll just be sitting second on the healing meters with rank 4 healing touch as my only heal used, 8% overhealing, and hoping not have to use any mana potions cause boy howdy are those expensive.
---
mt
---
That's a lame argument. I'm not a streamer and still managed to hit Level 60 and raid. And yes, it HAS become stale. Getting Preraid BiS doesn't take long and we cleared Ony+MC quickly, and now you only have that 1 raiding day every week.
---
its dire maul and its gear and gold farming, please read the comments.
---
Or just put a hunter up with MT and have him distracting shot Shazz back whenever he TPs.
---
Im hoping for an alternative timeline with the expansions that didn't happen
---
EPL is by far the worst most contagious scum filled zone in the game, Especially for warriors.. Plague bats...Plague worms, Plague ghouls, Freezing ghouls, Flame ghouls..Fuaark.
---
I agree with all these. The largest issue is them deviating from their schedule and providing poor notice.
---
I would say my main is Red Mage, but I'm an altaholic so my long term goal is to level everything to 80. I was about half way there when Classic launched and ruined everything! 😅
---
Awesome, thank you
---
It’s OK to group up for quests. I did 1-60 with a friend and we both had money for mount at 40.
---
*ploop*
---
Ah okay thanks, I could use a release!
---
He’s a mage. Using his brain isn’t his strongest attribute.
---
It doesn’t feel too great to be someone else’s source of fear and anxiety. If you meet someone who enjoys that, it’s usually a big red flag.
---
Eeeyyy mon 😁🖐️
---
&gt;  I don't think I will be able to keep up with this.
---
What do you have to keep up with?
---
Warriors don't have a positive matchup until trinkets. Instant Poison and Kidney Shot just do too much damage for us to come back once the stuns wear off. I imagine gear is a factor, though, and so I'd say you have Warriors and Paladins backwards in your estimation. 
---
If the Paladin lives through the Kidney Shot, which they should, they can just Hammer you and then heal back to full, resetting all you've done. If it gets dicey, they have two bubbles they can rely on. A downranked Consecration works wonders at popping Rogues out of stealth, too, since it ticks every second. Finally, if the Paladin is leveling as prot, you're doubly fucked and should just walk the other way. You will murder yourself on their aura, holy shield, and blessing long before you ever manage to kill them.
---
Nice, grats. Also that screenshot is hilarious.
---
Click... Oh.. Hang on...
---
What a stupid response. Imagine WoW getting translated and released to some random country a year after its initial release in the states and a guy from that country saying "what's the big deal about releasing AQ? We got it right after the game was released".
---
Why is stupidity so rampant with people who support such a stupid move?
---
WoW has been played, patched, and developed for MONTHS before you touched it. Just because you were late to the party doesn't mean the party didn't start until you got to it. Shut the hell up already and enough of this stupid argument.
---
A fellow tankadin! I respecced prot/holy at lvl 52 and plan to grind BRD at least till lvl 58. The best part is that I can heal and tank, depending on what the group needs.
---
This! Thank you! I don't want to wait months to sell my BoE epic just because some neckbeard wants 50G more than people are willing to buy it for, I need that fucking gold now!
---
just the right amount
---
I was assuming OP was referring to the whelpling thing that people where farming, making leveling hard due to lack of mobs.
---
It is an opinion by definition.
---
With your mouse cursor. Click, that's the sound the mouse makes.
---
I often say I'm happy that, as a Hunter, my pet is the one taking those debuffs. Worst case I slow down dps a little bit. And if I let it die and rez it, all debuffs gone!
---
Wish I still lived with my parents.
---
1 less top end damage and bottom end damage.
---
LITERALLY UNUSUABLE
---
&gt; The thing is casuals will always feel left behind because Vanilla WoW progression never catered to casuals. You can't say that Blizzard is releasing content too fast for casuals to experience because catering to casuals was never what the Vanilla experience was about.
---
Were you around for Vanilla? The biggest circlejerk criticism of WoW was that it was catered to casuals. That it was too easy compared to all the other popular mmorpgs.
---
Mortal strike: Dodge  
---
Overpower: Miss
---
and that means EU launched with DM right?
---
Physical activities are not comparable to watching TV or playing a video game.
---
&gt;  Classic+ will be a real thing we can wait for.
---
with the kind of numbers classic attracted, they would be mad to do *nothing*. at the very least i'd suspect for TBC to be re-released next
---
Sure Librams are great but I don’t really include them in mage specific gear. Pretty sure elemental staff sims higher then the magic staff but I would have to check. Regardless many classes get 6+ slots in dm which dramatically changes the texture of trying to pug older dungeons.
---
This. I'm also no lifing more than I want, I do also want a nice classic experience and not be behind, but i'm currently lvl 48 and going on holiday next week. With playing over 4 hours a day I feel I'm far behind, wtf.
---
Why do you want items to be at an artificially inflated price? What you're describing is basically collusion where companies all set prices together so there's no need to be competitive
---
Neither warrior nor sub 60 priest are very good at solo farming, you'll be fighting mages non stop. Lean into your strengths and farm instances imo. If you really can't stand in, you can kill mobs in deadwind pass and vendor their grays, the birds especially drop good vendor trash.
---
His shoulder *is* armor
---
Not only was this video entertaining as hell, but introduced me to Scatman John (RIP), who then provided the soundtrack for many, many play sessions. 
---
Good times, good memories. Thank you for posting this.
---
last time when I did it, our heal left the group ;-;  
---
"You can't hold fking aggro" he said
---
I don't want TBC next. I want Blizzard to come up with Classic Plus. At the very least cut out the most objectionable parts of TBC: no flying, no content gated behind daily quests, no gratuitous item stat inflation. 
---
But Classic TBC over BFA+
---
downvoted for nothing because you said asmon and good in the same sentence
---
Burning crusade all the way. Get me illidan and his preparedness as a commercial and I'll probably be willing to level clean account style.
---
Classic was *literally* designed for casuals. Go take a look at the design notes in interviews from back prior to launch. The designers wanted to make a game that was less hardcore than those around at the time.
---
but... but DM supposedly has these OP items better than MC gear? who would ever buy BoEs after DM launches??
---
Well I totally get where you say that if they're rolling for off-spec but to just say no to any class that needs the Rend swords (which is many) seems super trolly or doomed to fail
---
I rolled a Rogue alt.
---
I'm wondering, how "necessary" is the item Thistle Tea? I see it is a cooking recipe and requires mats from herbalism. So, does this mean I need to have herbalism? Is it easier to buy it? Do I simply not need it? I currently have skinning and mining just for gold making, will probably switch at 60. Just looking for info about this.
---
The only acceptable choice
---
Hope you rolled dwarf with that name.
---
I fired. And then i missed.
---
wow, do they share cd with engineering bombs?
---
&gt;12-28.
---
Jeez that's a lot of years to play WoW.
---
And the same goes for the goblin jumper cable xl recipe. Doesn't sell well at all on my server. 
---
If i have a few good runs 40g/h is reasonable. But i average 25-30g/h. 
---
If i would specc right i might make 30-35g/h on average.
---
Really? Then all my warlocks have lied to me or been big trolls because they’ve always made us run out to summon
---
Tauren. The thiccest of the thicc
---
I don't really get this mindset.   
---
How does it actually affect you that more content is coming out for people who want it? You're basically saying content should be gated for people already at max level because you aren't there yet and everyone needs to wait for you.  
---
This subreddit is the king of throwing insults like "no lifers" etc. at anyone who dares to be at max level with most of the BiS gear already. 
---
It really isn't too fast, most people already at 60 ARE getting bored as there's not a lot of content at 60 and DM ensures there's a good mix of dungeons. 
---
Even with these phases, there's really not that much content in them. For the most part it's just going to be raids and some pvp from here on out. The vast majority of content is 1-60, levelling alts for the most part which does not change at all with any of these phases.
---
Reddit would disagree since everyone here seems to think boe items should all be needed for gold
---
Yup, I gave up on it too. From lvl 36-44 on my warrior, nothing.
---
water essence hoarders where we at
---
I checked a couple sources before saying that to be sure, and they agreed with me: A 0.8x threat multiplier is put on Berserker Stance and Battle Stance.
---
[This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/) is a pretty in-depth one, the relevant bit is at the start of the THREAT MODIFIERS section. [This wiki article](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kenco%27s_research_on_threat#Threat_modifiers_from_Warrior_Stances) has it in the opening lines of the linked subsection.
---
It's somewhat arbitrary. Wrsth itself was already a pretty big leap from classic &amp; tbc. By 3.2 the game was already much closer in design to cata than vanilla.
---
No, but to chose which way it should blow you might. ;)
---
Acurate
---
In what retarded world would they come slower than they did originally?
---
Paying off an opposing faction's guild to corpse camp an annoying player from your faction!
---
Holy Mother of God, I did that on my warlock and my dots weren't strong enough. They heal to full in 1,5 sec or something. Was so pissed off then.
---
Ill always try the new expansions.  But so long as i have stuff to do in vanilla, thats what ill play. 
---
Should the case be that im 100% Done with nax and have the r13 pvp gear, and a new expansion comes out that turns out to be equally..uninteressting.. lll just quit.  And most likely try the game on and off.
---
TC only hits 4 targets iirc
---
I dont think I want you meating me... No thanks.
---
I got the quest as a kid. But i was only 12 years old and couldent complete all the demons. Only managed one before i gave up all together. 
---
I wasted so many potions trying to kite the winterspring one.
---
Now im a grown man and get to have another go at this quest!
---
It's always acceptable to ignore anything you don't want to do.
---
Me, I like torturing myself.
---
But tanking for an aoe group (which are so very dumb anyways) is completely different, you only need to group the initial pull, and get stragglers or those that resisted nova back into the kill zone. Outside of that it is up to the mages to kill things before they get to them. Druids are better for this with the ability to quickly tag multiple groups while pre-hotted. Anyone aoeing outside of an aoe group (or obvious aoe pack) is an idiot anyways.
---
For my warrior alt closing in on 30, should I try to do the whirlwind axe quest?  I have a 42 priest with a decent amount of gold I can buy the charms with, and I’m sure I can find someone in Arathi to help me with the 40 elite.  However, is solo killing the trolls in STV feasible, since they are level 33?  I tend to run solo and am not in a guild.
---
Love all the people in here saying "Yeah, you are a skinner, you spent the time leveling your skinning to 300, only others that could skin it get to roll for it" while in the same thread "No, you are a lockpicker, you spent the time leveling your lockpicking to 300, all of us that cant open the chest get to roll for it. Don't like it? Fine then we will kick you and find another dps."  
---
Hilarious.
---
Oh apparently you can’t summon someone who is outside the dungeon but within the dungeon works fine, guess I learned something new.
---
You should go out more xD
---
This is completely okay and expected at lower levels while lvling up.  Very few people level as healing/tanking specs, so it's silly to expect them to roll on only tank/heal gear when they fulfill an offspec role in dungeons.
---
However, once you get to mara/BRD+, you can't do this anymore.  People are going for their pre-raid BIS items for their final spec, and you need to establish what spec you will be rolling for.
---
So you would charge at a ?? skull [Insert Opposite Faction Here]?
---
Call alchemist control if ya bit by a spider, but check that its covered by ya guild priest provider
---
Plenty of mounts in the riding shop, but heavy mounts go to the Tauren spots
---
The damn Black Dragonscales are wroth mext to nothing on my server now. 30s a pop ☹️
---
lol i just bought my epic mount like a week ago (lock). f
---
But Then I Don't have Mana TIDe
---
Think you have to include boe off trash too.
---
Seriously, man. Slowing down and spending some time actually *playing* in the world is so much more fun than just banging it out for the numbers.
---
It always had. It used to be part of the affliction tree, where you could make it instant. Alot of people still havent realized that yet.
---
youll find groups and youll be getting all the loot people in your raids already got. youre never 'behind'
---
TIL 10 * 3,5 = 7.
---
Had a guy say LFM Brd Arena runs. 
---
I then join and ask which way we going. 
---
He says learn to read
---
I say there's a few ways there dumbass and left.
---
Some people are just thick
---
My favorite warrior combo is dodge, miss.
---
This way you avoid a lot a drama :p
---
So what? You chugged through content and this is your reward. Learn to enjoy it or unsub til the game comes around! A lot of people enjoy Classic because they don't feel obligated to speed through it, which is one of the issues with Current WoW and everything becoming obsolete so fast.
---
Learn to chill out and smell the roses but don't blame others because you have 7-10 days /played in a bit over 30 days of the game. You may be an adult but your acting like a bit of a child atm.
---
yup that what I do and have no problem iwth aggro ... regroth / rju gives so much heal threat .. charge roar and swipe is usally no problem and from there on only if the grps splits the dmg between 3 mobs ..
---
You are not going to mostly compete with casual-Players just because BG's are not cross realm.
---
I'd even argue that a less populated Server will be able to obtain better gear and enchants because you will have the same supply on a smaller community.
---
Nonetheless. The differences in gear is what makes Classic PVP. You'll have stronger People and better organized People. I think that cross realm will be very healthy. 
---
All Points you want - which you just mentioned above - will be improved by cross realm BG's. The only Thing missing will be the community aspect. But you will get that a lot in Phase 2. Remembering names of People etc.
---
It's 96 lotus per day and 2 layers currently so a Max of 192 lotus per day per server at this point in time
---
Tbh I think the layering has been handled decently, obviously it is by no means perfect though.
---
Munster
---
I love thw big numbers, but I hate the massive overheals.
---
Thanks bro
---
Why? Bank alt is a must if you don't have to fly to the auction after every quest. Behind my bank alt is a lvl 35 hardworking priest on the other side of the world not some corporate lol.
---
no its because reddit is full of idiots
---
As soon as you start cherry picking you're creating more things to fight over and givving blizzard more room to fuck it up. We know what tbc was and it was better than classic or retail. Sure it has flaws, but I'd take it as it was before I trust the discretion of blizzard.
---
But I'm not. 
---
My main was a mage I used SM and ZF to efficiently level from 28-52. I have 5 days playtime on this character, even today. I mostly just login to raid on it. 
---
My 55 alt Priest has a playtime of 4d12h. 
---
The games been out for a while now, these numbers arent hard to achieve for someone who enjoys the game and has a 9-5 &amp; a social life.
---
Thought it’s gonna be a warrior weapon.
---
I feel like I'm the only one happy for this.
---
Ofc they would have an Advantage. But everyone has the same chances. There is no one at an Advantage until they have made themselfs one. But everyone is able to make themselfs an Advantage.
---
Even on your Server there could be People fully T2 geared while others just hit Level 60. 
---
Where would that be fair if they played BG's against each other? Just like Crossrealm...
---
Classic PVP is just not fair. You'll have to deal with that. It is unbalanced and unfair. But it is fun :)
---
For real i'm bot even 40 yet! Hold the phone!
---
Traitor !!
---
A lot. Its the people who couldnt afford WoW. Now its ingrained into their brains the way WoW is for you and they think its a comparable game when it isnt. Runescape is good in its own way but its trash compared to WoW. Its not supposed to ve good compared to WoW it was designed by a solo designer on 1970s tech
---
Keeps the other faction from leveling, ergo less 60s for the faction being pvped
---
I have just under 9 days, the game has been out long enough where that's not mega sweaty - I just play for longer sessions, I dont even play daily. 
---
I still have a social life, I still have a 9-5, you're likely just inefficient with your time.
---
re launch of archeage that was launched years ago, this time with no p2w i heard
---
It will be worse, jacks up your miss chance through the roof
---
The fact that people still actually think this is fucking hilarious. And very sad. Especially since in classic you can’t group cross-server, so being outnumbered in your friend group when they vote to roll on a PvP server is just how it goes, no dice. 
---
But sure, keep repeating the same useless adage.
---
Get some unit frame add-ons. I use Shadowed unit frames (SUF) to show my, my targets and target-of-target frames as well as party, and have the latter hide itself in raids.
---
In addition to this I use Grid2 to show party/raid frames (can be enabled only during raids as well, but I prefer to have it always shown) and use that together with mouseover macros for party / raid healing.
---
Burning Crusade! Such a good expansion with fun raids and dungeons.
---
I just pre mark moon and most tanks get the hint pretty quick.
---
&gt; So far there is a lot of negative feedback from the community for it being too soon.
---
They are also a loud minority. Your average player is not 60 and probably doesn't even know this release is coming yet, and if they do ,they don't care, cos they'll just get there when they get there. 
---
The whiners are people who are bitter about not having more time to play and are now claiming classic is "ruined" because it doesn't specifically cater to them.
---
nice change from farming briarwood reed ad nauseum haha
---
Nah nah my man. I've done a lot of testing and a Druid just steamrolls through mobs. Hunters get all kinds of problems in solo situations. People just assume that because you have a tanky pet and you can heal it that it works out great. You have to stop your dps to heal, and it can all get really hectic if you do things like solo instances. Druid? Just HoT up, moonfire 3+ mobs (elite or no) and pop bear form. You're unkillable, you take little damage, you dish out plenty in return, you heal over time, and you can shift into a fast moving travel form immediately after. There's no competition. Wanna solo an elite? Entangling roots cannot be underestimated. The hunter's pet will get squished, your ability to do dps will be hampered by threat problems, etc. Hunters are fine, but Druids are the true solo masters. At least in classic.
---
It took less time for Dire Maul to release in original EU vanilla than it did now.
---
sounds like a fun build, mind sharing the full talent choices?
---
if you are 60 in 6 days you are not a slow leveler, an average 60 is 10 days 
---
don't be retarded
---
Yeah I’m still lost, class quests are designed to give you abilities for your class, or gear.  But hey, don’t do any of them, and you should be good.
---
sorry @KoreanShaco thats a bullshit comment
---
Nope he isn’t. He said “if the guy didn’t need to run the dungeon he should have said no.” That means he is telling the tank not to offer a paid service to run groups through dungeons.
---
I try to use get enough threat on the main target initially so dps can start doing their thing - then I rotate between additional mobs with the occasional trying to get out as many Sunders and Slams as possible without losing threat on the main target. If I lose threat on the maintarget I use taunt quickly to get it back and do a threat rotation there before looking at other targets again.  
---
also: don't use taunt at the beginning of the fight as it generates no threat - keep it to get escaping mobs back onto you.  
---
also:  if mobs still run wild if you do all this properly then your dps has a problem, not you.
---
Yeah fully agree. Some less played classes and specs (hunters/Druid’s in my guild) can lead to more stacked players too.
---
\&gt; Hope the zookeeper were at least able to extract the sinew, cause I certainly wasn’t... 
---
What about the giblets...
---
Your best bet is to check AH regularly, to see if others are sold. You can get an addon (like Auctioneer or Aux) which stores historic AH prices to make this easier. They also allow you to do full AH scans (which take some minutes), if you do that on a regular basis, you usually have a price info for everything.
---
&gt;The VAST majority of players aren’t 60.
---
Where are you getting this from? I started 2 weeks after launch, with full-time job, and I am 53.
---
&gt;we really never deserved classic because we’re just going to fuck it all up again aren’t we?
---
I think the fuck up came with catering the super-casual player, it's fine to be bad at the game, but constant whining (in 2005 and now) about it is bit tiring.
---
I CAN'T DO DAT YETI
---
Dude gets killed and takes his frustration out on the guy trying to help him.  Classy.
---
P2 will have absolutely no affect on anything raid related. It’s just adding some PvP features.
---
And that's how you get ninjad. Trusting people to "do the right thing". Morals and ethics can come after everyone has been given a fair chance to roll for the item. If people aren't kind, well, they probably would've ninjaed it when you all rolled greed anyway!
---
And my question was when are they not worth doing, not what is op asking here. 
---
Anyone got an example of a class quest not worth doing??
---
Nah, that's slow. The "average raider" in retail also does only LFR/Normal, and wipes on it too. That doesn't mean the content isn't easy.
---
Not having rage ironically gives one rage
---
This is what I aim on playing with at level 60: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005301-50320212-05552310001 . If you want just come by the stream and I'll go over why I picked each talent and answer any questions that you might have. I stream most days starting at 3PM EST :)
---
*[Laughs in late scaling]*
---
Where ^^
---
oh so being faster than the average isn't being fast, its just being a new average? 
---
are you actually retarded?

I'm not even lvl 40 yet.

Noones trying to stop you from doing that.
---
Why are you so upset other people get more content to clear?
---
So not a real school then. Thanx
---
If they put in the time they should be rewarded.
---
Ok thank you, and also last question, does items in your bank transfer as well or just the items in your current bags?
---
More like /r/NeverTellMeTheOdds
---
Obviously the pet quests are worth it, especially succubus and void walker. The next would be at lvl 35 for the OH item "the orb of dar'orahil". That OH coupled with the dagger from SM lib should last you until 50!
---
Thank you! If you're feeling like you want to be extra nice, I could really use a follow on Twitch so I can get closer to reaching Affiliate. In any case, thank you for the kind words, happy to hear you enjoyed the video :)
---
Start as an OT, no one gets recruited right into a MT position unless the guild is desperate
---
while I agree that saving rage is good, to reach 100 rage as a bear when in early dungeons will mean that you DPS guys are totally inactive, since it will take quite a bit of time...
---
But its OEM keys not legit keys. Anyway if it works why not XD.
---
Probably I just suck, but everytime I've tried farming princess I can't do it - I manage sometimes at the rock but that's buggy as hell, just running around in a circle (with minor speed enchant) she still catches me and just windfuries me down - even when she does she's hitting for for like 10s before she does dust field
---
I agree, it feels nice again that every level every inch is monumental and enjoyable, I don’t feel worthless for not being 60 yet because I’m always achieving something. It’s not just rush rush rush to max level because that’s where the worthwhile content is.
---
My best deed towards an alliance (I’m horde) was when I helped this NE hunter struggling with a mob which he would’ve definitely died from. When we killed the mob together he dinged. That was quite satisfying.
---
Found the rogue pickpocket macro on a super shit UI forum back in the day. Remember that galaxy background with the tan post background?
---
The game isn’t designed around casuals. That’s retail you’re thinking about.
---
I don't think anyone is ignoring that, they are saying that DM will almost double those numbers.
---
It's not *their job* to help you get the things you want.
---
Especially if they're already geared up. 
---
So if they have no incentive to be there, there is the possibility of monetary incentive. 
---
The tank gets gold, something they CAN use. And the group gets a much better geared, possibly more experienced and competent player... cutting down on wipes and runtime. And time is money. So everyone can do more runs. 
---
It's win-win all around.
---
Kang the Decapitator should last you till 60
---
Because the sooner these people inch us to Naxx, the sooner the entire game will be other whether we like it or not. I'd rather not play on a Naxx progressed server.. nothing about "FRESH" but fuck PvPing against T3 in blues.
---
I recently respecced as a ret / holy hybrid with Redoubt and I have no issues tanking 5 mans even the dreaded Strat Live. Improved Retribution Aura is so important.
---
Yeah this is a real shame
---
Always do all
---
Wouldn't it be epic if this post had had no replies at all? :)
---
Wasn't OP also some youtube video from ages ago or something?
---
Yup, if you compare a tank's Rage bar to their level of bitching about threat you will notice that the ones doing the most bitching are the ones ending fights with little to no Rage.
---
It will, however, totally fuck with the economy so gotta get 60 quick and get in there for a piece of that sweet gold action!
---
*Laughs in Kick*
---
We got demon skin.
---
But rag was stronger and talents was worse back then right? So DM gear was more "necessary" than it is now.
---
Exactly, I've played every day for 2/3 hours since release and I just hit 40 last night. Fuck.
---
Looks like you can go to Anathema or Arcanite Reaper.

There is no harm in having over 10% hit on your Rogue as long as you're good items to get it (Truestrike/Mask/Blackcrow/Devilsaur set). It will improve your white damage which improves your overall damage.
---
The 6% (at 305 weapon skill) is an absolute **minimum** for raiding, it is not a maximum that you should try to avoid going over.
---
lol
---
Think you are better off getting https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6830/bonebiter from the quest. I did the whirlwind axe last night and those trolls are a pain in the ass to kill since they are lvl 33-36 and its hard to only agro 1 and you have to share the zone with the other faction.
---
This.
---
This is also my plan :) As a filthy casual I know I won't have the time to give to be a MT...but I can gear up in 5-10mans and get enough utility to be useful in a raid. 
---
Currently I'm levelling my alchemy and cooking so if a guild needs an OT I can either join a guild as a casual or remain as a sword n board for hire. 
---
Basically: make yourself useful and the opportunities will come.
---
&gt;Not feel like I'm constantly trying to keep up. 
---
At your pace you always will be behind. Thats fine, by the way. But why is it so important to keep the people progressing faster than you away from new content?
---
Yah, well, if people would just DPS your main target (skull) instead of an alternative target, or stop to AOE directly, life would be easier...
---
I think that by casting rejuv on yourself, pulling with FF and then use Roar, you will be doing pretty well with initial threat. If someone decides to AOE directly when you pull, well, its their fault.
---
So far (I am just 37) I have had very good experience when tanking. Sure, I lose aggro from time to time, especially my last few runs when I was level 37 and the DPS were level 42 and we did RFD. But all in all people have been friendly and patient, and to some extent good players.

My Finnish great-grandparents would jokingly insult each other like that. He was from West Finland, so she would call him a Swede and she was from the East, so he called her a Communist (Russian).

Which is funny because it turns out, part of his family originally came from Russia. And they changed their name to hide that.

"You are an evil korean", iirc. It's one of the examples on a horde-alliance translator website
---
So I assume as a Priest I should spam high level dungeons as Healer for money? I did a almost full BRD run and I got like 15g. Is running dungeons profitable? I also need 4 righteous orbs for Truefaith Vestments, so I will have to run them anyway.
---
A few prebis items drop in DM. You still got plenty of prebis in the other dungeons.
---
No, I played launch at EU, and I'm pretty sure my launch was not shitty in the slightest outside of server instability. And funnily enough i still ran pretty much every dungeon in the game.
---

I just purchased an epic mount for 900g as a warlock because I thought phase 2 wouldn't drop until later this year. RIP or reckon I can open a ticket and ask for a possible refund...?
---
The problem is more that the endgame content is so easy that you litteraly clear it all in one or 2 raids. It was a big mistake to start the game with all the players/gear buffed to the current patch state while keeping MC the same as launch.
---
Cool so Naxx by the end of 2019 too? It's the course we're setting mate, not Dire Maul.

#  &lt;Frostmane Troll Whelps&gt; is now recruiting hardy trolls on the Rattlegore server, Horde Side
---
I,  the troll Coldgrin, am returning to my ancestral frosty homeland of Dun  Morogh to join my beleaguered brothers there, in defending our cave  against the tiny invaders, the Dwarves and Gnomes of the Alliance. I  call on all Frostmane trolls to join me in asserting our rightful claim  to the frosty cave of Dun Morogh.
---
guild rules:
---
* must be a troll
---
* must be level 6 or below
---
* must be dedicated to defending our troll cave in Dun Morogh.
---
luckily,  I also have a warlock main who will provide you with a free summon to  Kargath, the nearest horde base to Dun Morogh, once you are prepared.
---
find me online as Coldgrin, or Takriban (main, not in guild).
---
&gt; level 53 with 7 days 14 hours played played. 
---
lol? :D
---
thats the issue here... you play enough but not very efficient.
---
7 days is more than enough to hit lvl 60.
---
No changes.
---
all the naked gearless people. I've seen those.
---
Sounds like a problem with your mentality than the game. 
---
Statistically speaking you were probably ""behind"" back in 2005 too, but did you care back then? You probably didn't.
---
Hey, I'm 53 too! But to be honest, classic is going to last next couple of years anyways so I'm sure I have plenty of time to get bored to grinding raids over that time.
---
Well noone even asked you is the point. Your assuming that they need the advice in the first place because you can't imagine there's actually a good reason for them to be doing what they are doing.
---
If they truly are this new player that doesn't know better, I don't see a problem with letting them enjoy the game doing whatever they'd like. It quickly turns into a min-max thought process that can ruin the fun that people have the first time.
---
Even if they listen to you and leave for somewhere else there's a decent chance they are doing it because they just had a confrontation with you and would rather just leave to avoid you. You might think your being nice and all but there's a fundamental problem with giving advice to those who don't need it (because there's nothing wrong with what they choose to do in a game) and didn't ask for it, especially if the reason you are giving that advice is so you can have their farming spot.
---
Just don t, you ll trigger his first aid debuff and prevent him from using his true bandages.
---
Leveling a rogue, it's frustrating how a couple of misses is the difference between 75% hp, and 15%. Just lose all momentum.
---
Receiving a tip and charging people are different things.

I would never charge anyone to tank a dungeon. But I would never refuse a tip.

if you dont like it you can always go back to retail.

I'm using the Wyrmhide shoulders that only gives 2% hit and nothing else. Should I wear that or use some shoulders that give agi/stam but lose 2% hit making me at 8% hit?
---
Well the concept is that your weapon gets stuck on the tar covered body. As long as you attack, you lose...
---
Dude, this game will be around for years and years. Its only been 6 weeks? You aren't behind at all. There will be people recruiting for MC raids half a year from now. Mark my words. 
---
Most people have alts. If your worries were true, nobody would ever be able to level and gear an alt. Play what makes you happy! Don't worry about what other people think or are doing. Your time with the game, is your time.
---
Personally... I speak from experience. I rolled a Hunter, dropped it at 36. I rolled a Warlock, dropped it at 28. I rolled a Paladin, dropped it at 35. I rolled a warrior, dropped it at 17. I rolled a Druid, dropped it at 21 (though someday this will be my real alt). Mage, 14. Rogue, 19. Instead of a level 60, I have a smattering of level 20s and 30s. Sometimes, I've thought to myself, am I behind? I see people walking around in MC tier 1. No, I'm not behind. We have two more tiers to go through until TBC or whatever happens, and I'm running out of classes to switch to. :) (currently a 17 Shaman, I'm POSITIVE this is my main...).
---
My main problem is, I kept picking classes that I liked back when I was 14. It took me a while to realize that I'm a different person now, living a different life. It took me a while to realize that and see that I was picking classes simply because they were my old favorites, not what I actually wanted to play now.
---
Sorry for the wall of text. Sometimes they're necessary!
---
*LIVE TO WIN*
---
Well they sure are sellable.
---
Generally it is currently faster to lt to full mana than drink, until the new water rank is released with dm.
---
another reason why I avoid PVP servers.
---
Probably had a Rogue already who was looking for gear.
---
I have a LWer and honestly just convert light leathers into medium leathers. I outgrew the light leather phase with my LWer faster than my character could leave areas that have light leather/scrap skinned creatures. Four light leathers to a medium leather? That's not a terrible conversion rate.
---
Hey that's me! Bought mount just before I logged last night thinking I'd have an epic mount 2 months before class mount. Major RIP
---
This exactly.
---
Felhunter can devour hoj and tidal charm, too, btw. :^)
---
Also, grenades are incaps and not stuns.
---
Well shit, was planning on going to farm them after I hit 60
---
I dont think more than 2% are pleased with this.. Loads of ppl at 60 are still farming for bis and have plenty of stuff to do... Not many had run out of stuff to do
---
let me get my mana up so we can kill the damn thing faster so you don't take so many hits and maybe youll spend 2 gold every 2 runs
---
How do I know if my one handers are better dps than my two handers?
---
I have a 21dps staff, but also 18/15dps swords. In this case would it better to swtich to dual weild until i get a two hander upgrade? I'm only lvl 28 so talents probably dont matter that much regarding weapon choice.
---
I like having a weapon with lifesteal, it's nice to have a decent damage proc that also heals you
---
The tank IS the healer's priority though. I can do with 1 less dps. Without the tank we'll die. If the tank dies, the mobs will come on me and then we'll -again- die. Of course the healer can heal their side-dps but the priority is still the tank and a dps that chops its own hp down to almost nothing is pretty low on that list. I know that's part of the lock's style but some people abuse it and then complain when the healer chooses not to risk the entire party by wasting mana on the lock in a tight situation.
---
How fast would this action be? Say the mob is casting heal (3 second cast), at what point would I be Shield Bashing it with this macro if I did it the moment it started healing?
---
What you slow levelers who are enjoying the game at your own pace need to realize is there is a massive group of 60s with no content left to do.  Who do you think Blizzard is going to cater to?
---
This isn't even humor, it's just a fact. 
---
I want to play paladin but they're basically uselss endgame and everything I've read says unless you're holy you won't get invited for any endgame content, so I'm forced to play a weaker, slower character.
---
If you are a guildie, you get free food/water/portals anytime.   
---
If you are asking me for water/food in town with a kind sentence, I'll probably give 3stacks food &amp; water, tips are always appreciated, but not necessary. If you say "give water", you are ignored. :)
---
If you trade me without saying anything, you are the biggest scum on azeroth, simple. I don't expect a priest running right beside me to buff me with max rank fort &amp; spirit without saying anything to them. Don't trade a mage without letting them know of your intention.
---
A principle is either valid or invalid. The value being discussed doesn't matter.
---
What's wrong with your example is that the skin isn't normal loot. It's not loot at all. The game designers could have made it just another looted item that follows loot rules, but they chose to specifically NOT do so. It's only available to skinners.
---
Your latter comment is valid, though. If there are multiple skimmers, there must be a fair way to determine who gets to skin it. And that's solution is already used to answer the question: who gets to mine nodes?
---
The fuck? It's nothing to do with spell batching, it's a passive disarm. Fuck outta here with your sky is falling bitching.
---
You see why you shouldn't defend random people on reddit?
---
I have decline trades on by default. I have to open a trade window. Turn it back off for raids and 5-mans.
---
&gt;  So now I guess by the time I'm 60 no reason to be able to do Molten Core? 
---
Yep, the handful of pieces for a handful of classes that are better than MC gear will make it so no one is going to run MC anymore, ever. /s
---
I agree it's early, but if you look at the original Dire Maul release it's actually released in a similar time frame as it originally was released
---
Does Blizzard release patch notes for smaller patches (like the one just now)?
---
This was mind blowing once I realised it works:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1qlh3/warrior\_leveling\_rotation/ezpgoiq/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1qlh3/warrior_leveling_rotation/ezpgoiq/?context=3)
---
If you mean like dead vs nodead or similar adding no before it should work.
---
I don't think it's reasonable for Blizzard to time their content releases around people who take 4-6 months to hit level 60 no. And demanding that Blizzard do so and then stomping your feet and threatening to quit  because a pre-raid 5 man dungeon is being released "too soon" for you is peak entitlement.

Getting large amounts of gold from instances by simply vendoring pumps the economy with insane amounts of golds. Hunters soloing tribute for 100g/hour, mages/locks/priests farming lashers/dogs for 70g/hour and DME jump runs for warrior/healers doing 50g/hour is insane. 
---
On nostalrius gold was inflated by more than 100% when DM came out
---
Where did I say he wasn't told?
---
Thats the whole point. Nobody is stopping them from doing them and there are plenty of people in the same boat. When I played vanilla, DM was already out, it was months before I hit 60. At that point I was still doing MC with nax out gathering gear to do nax and beyond. 
---
And back then we had "no lifers" already done with all the content ready for more. To me there is way to much outrage over a dungeon that was released early on in wows life (when they had half the subscribers they did around release).
---
If this guy feels "obligated" to speed through it that's his problem. Here I am running 60 dungeons, looking to raid this week, and running our low levels through their dungeons so the can experience the high level content with us. Cause we gonna be doing this for a while.
---
The boat on letting people try MC without overpowered gear sailed when they released the game on the current patch state. We're currently way overpowered for MC.
---
Its not that they we're forced, but if the usual way of making gold isn't really available to them, there is nothing wrong with them making gold by doing the one thing they are good at. It's not like anyone is forcing you to pay them. Besides, better to have tanks around that will tank for gold than there be no tanks around at all.
---
Challenging and time consuming are not the same thing.
---
Couldn't get to the throne room huh?
---
That's a bad comparison, though. It would be like an alliance who's never walked into Darn
---
You're allowed to defend yourself. If you can take on 2 players at once, a lock and a hunter no less (I'm personally finding this story a bit sketchy), I don't see how they ever killed you unless you just stood there and ignored them, letting them kill you.
---
Yes. This.
---
God I need to farm water essences.
---
i’m new to wow, can someone please explain what i’m looking at here?
---
I was hoping you would grace us with your presence.
---
Three runs through ZG and you're geared enough for AQ. The devs stated that ZG exists to catch players up.
---
Also everyone already played Naxx in WotLK and it's really not that technical outside of a few bosses. Frankly, by that point, I'll care more about what happens after Naxx than during it.
---
I would say is all relative, I remember going to WoW from FF11 and was pleasantly surprise on how easy it was in comparison, you can actually kill things solo lol.
---
But compare to now Classic is probably more "hardcore" then current MMO I imagine.
---
Doubt they have said that many times considering Dire Maul was released 1 month later than classic similarly like its being released now
---
I get called a lot of names for not helping some guy gank or do something stupid. I am pretty strict in my rules of only going after aggressors.
---
But I corpse camp like a motherfucker when people try me.
---
Care to share some of your warrior macros ? Btw great commitment!
---
Because instead of leveling 4 other people in BRD, they will solo grind 52-60 in Dire Maul all the while making 700g.
---
If it works for you man, keep at it.
---
My rage bar drops mighty fast when I start using swipe and maul is next to useless for dumping rage.
---
The timers arent in sync, so it's not from the same mob. Still really sick!
---
My only regret as a low level shaman is that I can't return a buff for all the helpful mages, priests, and druids I encounter while in the Barrens.
---
Get bartender, scrap the pet bar and create a new bar with your macros in place of it
---
An absolute madman!
---
You can buy both soil and morrowgrain from AH.
---
Also there are dirt mounds scattered around the crater that hand out dirty payoffs.
---
Honestly, I’ve found picking up level 58/59s for all the Non-UBRS dungeons to be a lot faster and easier with not much sacrifice in terms of group power
---
I'd like to crack a joke that I undercut by these huge margins but no, I honestly also feel the same. Why bother putting it up on the AH if you're just making peanuts over the vendor price? You could have killed a trash mob or two and made that amount.
---
Some more information:
---
25ish Peaky Grinders (a guild on Mograine-EU) found no worthy competition in the Gurubashi arena, nor in STV yesterday evening. So we raided some alliance settlements to end up at Stormwind, where we took over the Auction house by killing their proprietors and then took the tram to Ironforge.
---
A clip of the Stormwind part (the run to the auction house + run to and trip on the tram to IF) was made:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnkUyyOrB5c&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnkUyyOrB5c&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Also we have paper skin and glass bones. I'd say that's the biggest drawback.
---
Blizzard HQ before launch: M8 i tHiNk 2 sErVeRs aRe EnOuGh
---
Gimme TBC, WOTLK and Legion. Rest I dont care about really.
---
But yes, I would love to go TBC. It is better than vanilla imo.
---
I think you can stealth to the vault like shown here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/de9ch5/hey_guys_saw_a_rogue_asking_for_an_updated_and/
---
Not sure if you can solo the keepers for the key though...
---
Is there a way to do it with Dominos?
---
Just don't play WoW, tbh. Seems like you always manage to find something to complain about.
---
well they were added at some point during vanilla and since a lot of people were pushed out of their first chosen server by queues there will probably be payed transfers for a chance to go back to your friends when the population is more stable.
---
Youre gonna get yelled at regardless by everyone because people are dumb? Corpse maker drops and its actually good for you and you win? Warrior yells at you for taking his weap.
---
My mate plays a paladin and is not used to classic warlocks at all. I had to repeatedly train him to not drop half his mana bar on me when I tap all the way down halfway through a dungeon. Now he knows I'l be eating or bandaging.
---
In combat = please heal. Out of combat = I'm good.
---
Learn to sarcasm correctly.
---
You are looking for the word "joking".
---
You were joking.
---
Druid bar, so you can still see your mana while in animal form. If you get an innervate or something it won't be accurate though, but otherwise it is.
---
I'd say do it in a group, once DM is out, coffer runs will likely be a trgular thing.
---
Would [pet:nofelhunter] for example work?
---
Haha you spend too much time on Reddit
---
I have the same problem. How can we open the settings if "/aap" and interface menu don't work ?
---
Best advice imo is that you just do whatever you'd do at 60 now. Grind for gold if you're gonna need it for your mount, dungons if you need the gear, rep if you need the rep. Mays well get the exp also if you're going to have to do those things at 60.
---
I've been buying silk cloth under 2s for a few weeks now. You can turn them into bandages and sell them for 2s.
---
Some people just throw whatever they have on the AH and I'm pretty sure they're using an addon that prices it for them because I see no reason why you'd try to put silk on the AH for 40c more than what the vendor gives you for it.
---
\#taking notes
---
Are they though?
---
They are like the defias pillagers of red ridge, their fireballs hit so hard and you have so little to deal with them at level.
---
It really depends on what you want out of the game. In all honesty, only you, after having experienced the game and some of its classes will be able to decide what you will play.
---
“I was only pretending to be retarded”
---
The point is, the more threat you put out, the better the group/raid can utilize it's dps
---
You should have got a hunter to tame it and call it Harambe and then shot it for the screenshot
---
Crazy.
---
I kinda already did quite amount of quests there. I might finish that up, and go to winterspring, since i barely did anything there?
---
To be fair though, that version wasn't very good.
---
If your main goal is to get to 60 ASAP then just go solo quests since you're a druid. One advantage of leaving a lot of end game quests alone is a ton of extra gold at 60, though.
---
..... Oh my fuck. How have I never thought to do this.
---
Less than a month actually. WoW EU Was Feb 11th, Dire Maul was March 8th.
---
How? This is only 6 weeks earlier than it was released in the actual Vanilla launch. If you played in Europe you always started with DM
---
x1000000 this when DM water is out
---
Wait I thought it didn't drop until phase 2 (unlike the eye of shadow)
---
Don’t need any mana as grinding with a hunter.
---
And stop killing them 1 by 1. That’s so ineffective. Pull at least 4 mobs with your pet. Use dash so it can get in aggro range without taking hits. Group them up and just have Multi-Shot on constant cool down. Tab switch to any target that’s runs for you and send pet to that one. 
---
Find the perfect threshold where you don’t need to mend pet after every fight. Some mobs you can only do 3, others up to 5.
---
Makes sense.
---
I dont care about questing for gold, when needed i will just farm gold on my own. Thank you :)
---
As a Mage you will very rarely if never find yourself OOM and waiting for it to regen. You have evocate, your own mana gems, mana potions, mana runes, and a wand. If the boss hasn't died by then you won't gain anything by worrying about having more spirit.
---
Remember that some classes aren't limited to one role. As a druid/paladin you don't have to be a "nameplate clicker". Both can be also played as DPS/tanks.
---
Personally I got a feral druid vibe from you. You can easily play a tank while also healing/DPS if needed be. Not to mention buffs and CR.
---
For Warlock and Shadowpriest, there is. Even crafted stuff is better than most of this.
---
I can atleast get a replacement for wardens staff since it's way too expensive.
---
Wouldn't this mean, that by using combat's +hit talents (5%), one would only need 1% hit to reach the cap?
---
And contributing with Hurricane whenever there are no nova resists.
---
You're never going to tank an AoE pack for a spellcleave group no matter what class you play.  Tanks trying to do so are just as dumb as Mages trying to AoE in a group where they are the only AoE class.  Both need to learn their role for the group setup and play accordingly.
---
Titan panel
---
Yeah, the insults were unnecessary. It would have been funny if it was just him telling you to get better.
---
\- "What do we do now?"  
---
\- "Now we can finally play the game"
---
Oh wow, why I haven't I been doing this all along.
---
If you’re level 60 youre part of that 1%

Not forget about them, but if you are losing lets say 4 spell power but gaining 12 stam 11 int vs an item that is just shadow dmg, then the boe green is only bis in pure theoretical dps context.  As i said there are some slots where you gotta go shadow wrath since the alternatives are far inferior, but when it is very close then I prefer to not contribute to my character being a glass cannon.  I bought the greens but am still going to run some dungeons in my spare time to try to get the other stuff.
---
Maxed out my lw from the mats i got from skinning, and dropped the latter yesterday and nuked 1-265 enchanting in under two hours (including the Ulda rum to the master trainer) for just 100g. Mats are super cheap now, so hear me out and hear me well, fellow tanking druids, now is the time to acquire the smoking heart we all long for!
---
It's literally the last patch before bc, even after naxx. We deal over twice as much dmg in mc as we did back in the day.
---
I'm in the same struggle as you, but apparantly having more than 6k mana makes things way easier. So you could try to get a hold of some +int pieces instead of the pieces that are BiS for us (and have spell power).
---
My iPhone can \^\^
---
&gt; better to have tanks around that will tank for gold than there be no tanks around at all. 
---
These aren't the only options. Not sure why you chose to phrase it that way.
---
&gt;  It's not like anyone is forcing you to pay them 
---
A lot of people in this thread seem to want this to become the norm. The question is whether it's entitled tanks or naive/desperate non-tanks.
---
Read the comment. If you still have problems understanding perhaps you shouldn't be writing to the internet?
---
DM leaves everyone who is not able to do any of the above mentioned farms in the dust. Nothing can compare to the Tribute farm or lasher/dogs. 
---
I know that the economy would get destroyed by DM either way, it’s just too soon as the markets haven’t stabilized yet, and now they are being turned over again
---
you can use shield bash in battle stance btw
---
At least the stack stays after you log out for a while
---
Lol isn’t this a satirical post? Why is everyone upset
---
Wtf already?? The release sheduel should be fitter for NORMIES; not asmongold and neetsbuxers
---
No expansions for classic at all please. And I couldn’t care less for retail expansions.
---
New Horizontal content or nothing would me my favorite approach.
---
I must say, what a fine class you've chosen to play
---
Night dad
---
That has nothing to do with Classic and today though. 
---
In fact, it makes it even more strange that it's released about a month and a half after release. But then again it was pretty much out at launch for EU. 
---
And I think you don't understand the issue. The issue is that people ARE clearing raids left, right and centre today. 
---
It would be nicer to see raids actually coming with some challenges. Hopefully they tune BWL a bit better and just see MC and Onyxia as shoehorns into raising as they pretty much were intended to.
---
Warriors who raid tank don't bother with it either so the point is moot.
---
Dude just a question: what SA is?
---
yes, its called auctioneer.
---
Nah, don't you know that Blizzard support aren't allowed to make any human errors ever.
---
I'd play my hunter more if I could get a feign death into freeze trap macro to work properly I can it's user error but it's pissing me off
---
Yeah what others have said. Basically casters are OP because they always do good damage (while leveling) without needing to have to worry about getting a good weapon to help in that regard. They just run out of mana faster without better gear.
---
You ok there, buddy?
---
That’s an internet meme. DM was not a catch up dungeon, in fact this release is only 6 weeks early, patch 1.3. If you lived in Europe the game actually started with Dire Maul
---
Meanwhile as a Hunter I apply hunter's mark, serpent sting, send in my pet and then alt+tab while it dies.
---
This is why I dual wield so more swings is more chance to hit. Would rather do little dps than none when the big 2h swing misses several times in a row.
---
This guy left his entire guild behind, made a new guild and named it out of spite, and also made the effort to post it all on reddit. “Just laugh it off and ignore it” isn’t what he is doing my guy.
---
It surprises me to hear that rogues have a hard time getting groups. My friends play warlock and mage, and I play a prot Warrior. Whenever we form a group for something, the usual classes that join will be a rogue and a priest.
---
My friend brought it up that this seemed to be our standard group comp. I hadn’t noticed, but then I thought about it, and the most recent 3 groups that day had all be that group comp, with all different rogues and priests.
---
That was a good one.
---
Not until Cata it isn’t lol
---
I enjoy the game in general a lot, I am just very picky/overthinking.
---
not any class, only warriors
---
 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
---
What tuning? It is what is, it seems like you are the one who doesn’t understand classic. The enemy values are being copy pasted from the original, there’s no “adjusting”.
---
This is why I love classic. You actually remember the people you play with, see them in the world, make friends with them. God it's so great.
---
i took all mine off auction after reading the news ;d gonna try get 30+ saved up
---
I'm glad I've got mine during a guild run, so no debate.
---
With randoms I'm not sure. Yes, it's your profession and if you got the knife you're obviously destined to skin it. However, unlike other professions (ores, herbs) you have to have 6-7 others in order to actually kill the beast.
---
Dropped on my first run and I wore it until I reached the questgiver :')
---
At 38 we used to do 50-60k in Armory (3 arms warrs, 1 enh shaman, 1 priest, all but priest with Ravagers).
---
With optimal groups dungeon grinding is amazing.
---
Np, enjoy your rushed experience. Go back to BFA.
---
is dual-wielding ARMS spec even a thing?
---
I'm not sure how representative am I of average wow player but I have no idea what that game is. Not sure if Blizzard would care either.
---
I've thought about this, and this is the limiting factor.
---
But if collections could somehow be enforced, there would definitely be mega-banks on each server...just like irl.
---
Races like High Elves, Ogres, Forest Trolls and Wildhammer Dwarfs are the OG allied races that everyone has been waiting for since Vanilla. Yet they give us emo elves, gnome cyborgs and furries instead -.-
---
Warlock
---
Thanks for adding all those things about yourself. It makes it much easier to give you advice having a little knowledge to go off of. I'd suggest a Mage - the guides will have you go frost which is efficient and perfect for learning and soloing/dungeons alike, but is pretty boring. Fire has a couple more buttons, but requires a little more effort on your part. You are viable in all situations.
---
I meant my comment as a response to the point you made about using Maul to dump rage.
---
You only get to where you can charge for service if you put in your own time and money, no matter if we're talking guitarists or professions in a video game. There is most definitely a difference between learning guitar and getting to 300, but both do require time, effort, and have costs to them. Enchanters, tailors, blacksmiths, alchemists, all need to spend a lot of gold and time on materials to get to max level in their professions; guitarists need amps, guitars, and rehearsal. Just because the customer doesn't care about the cost to the guitarist/blacksmith doesn't mean it won't factor into that person's decision on how much to charge for their service.
---
I think the analogy they were making is more that while the customer (i.e. the venue or the person wanting a free enchant) may think the price is unfair or excessive, the person providing the service has to account for all of their extra expenses in acquiring the skills. The customer on the other hand is having to leverage that against the amount of value they'll get from your service. Where the analogy falls apart is that the longer you spend learning guitar, the better at it you'll get, and the more you can charge for your services, while a WoW profession has an absolute limit to what you can offer.
---
The only true value of service is how much somebody is willing to pay for it. If somebody doesn't think your price is fair, they won't pay for your service, but if you can find someone to pay you 250 gold for your Mount Speed enchant then there's nothing wrong with charging them 250 gold for it.

Sunder Armor
---
Sunder armour?
---
One thing I cannot stand about druids is that I have to run/fight a lot while not seeing my character/gear, but being a boring animal. In endgame I would most likely be healing as a druid though, as that's what hybrids do right?
---
And you’re just gonna spend it on wow anyways
---
not everyone is like that. 
---
I have cleared MC and Ony twice, and i have a full time job + other hobbies.
---
I don't care either way, but to play devil's advocate: sure they wouldn't have been able to skin it, but you didn't get to that point with the boss dead on your own. It was a group effort.
---
Activate left-handed mouse from Windows, and use the Numpad to move/skills
---
Not him, but I'd sit in darn and port to if/sw
---
Do what you want to do, but don't be surprised if people start drama with you from time to time. People get set in their ways, its one of the downsides of playing a hybrid class. Bear druids are fine, they have a massive HP pool and good avoidance, they just lack mitigation (a shield basically). They're the Deathknights of classic, in that regard (and DKs could tank just fine honestly).
---
Healing is... for certain people. Its really stressful and you kind of need to be hardcore to do it right. This means lots of spell downranking, doing math, studying lots of guides, etc. Being a good tank is pretty easy, you just get the gear you need and taunt stuff. The hardest part is leading people, but even that isn't too hard, you just set marks.
---
It will be a challenge, but I personally think Druids are an amazing solo class that is very fun to play,  so they are worth gearing up. And yeah... all the tier sets for hybrids suck for non-healers (as they give bonuses to healing mostly).
---
&gt; Sort ya self out fuck nugget...
---
That's what I expect to hear when I would ask a mage for water...
---
They are copied while we have better talents and gear. It's already easier plus all the prior knowledge. So the problem is indeed that there is no adjustments for that. Makes it a fast food version of the game pretty much. 
---
So it would be a more "Vanilla" experience of that was taken into account.
---
Unfortunately, those nolifers are a very vocal minority.
---
The vast majority of us who are just chilling and leveling are less likely to whine to Blizz about the content.
---
&gt; Edit: I didn't realize literally none of you could take a joke. Damn neckbeards. 
---
Ohh it was a joke but you still reply like you meant it ... what the hell is wrong with you.
---
Ya mon!
---
Any tips on farming him? I have a lv16 twink sitting there in the water since 2 weeks which i occasionally log in but my unitscan never went Off :(
---
Damn so many salty people in the comments.
---
I'm probably going to get burned for this but I recently re-specced to Arms and chose sword spec instead of Axes. I traded in my Windfury axe for my one handed sword and a shield and even though it's a lot slower killing mobs I definitely don't die as often and since I am in no rush to get to 60 I'm more than happy to play solo using my trusted board and sword :p
---
Sunder armor
---
They go for whatever people want to buy/sell them at. Not because you deem them to have a 10g fixed price
---
His comment doesn't specify the scenario, so it's up to interpretation.  The reason I'm responding to your comment, is because:
---
&gt; *only if you have close to unlimited rage due to incoming damage
---
&gt; otherwise swipe and auto attack is better for rage management
---
Makes no sense to me, so if you can describe a scenario in which it does, I'd like to hear it
---
I think if you mouse over your auto attack or your shoot or whatever it's called in the spell book, it tells you the crit chance
---
Damn those are the only things I'm missing. Still need 20 more and they are all 4g each now.
---
ive been level 60 since week 2 and have found ONE blue BOE the entire time. I'm averaging over 10 hours a day.  Don't feel too bad, at least you got AN epic.
---
Wanderlust - Wool Shoes
---
Never played classic before, but I loved tanking in retail WoW. Rolled a druid, 'cause I like beeing big and fluffy. It was awesome in questing and Ragefire Chasm.
---
And then I tried to level up a warrior. I really hope he gets better soon. I'm level 13 right now and I feel soo useless and weak. :/
---
Just went through the process of buying a Windows key. The $20 keys are usually OEM and are non-transferable so if you change hardware, you'll need a new key. I bought one on Kinguin or however it's spelled and got what I thought was a bunk key. Just called Microsoft and had it activated within 10 minutes. Longest part of that was reading off some 30 digit code over the phone.
---
Ah yes. And change into Def stance when the mob starts casting.. Just to have exactly 0 rage. Unless you pick the arms talent that lets you keep SOME rage when switching stance. Good times. :D still love my little gnome warrior to death. He's so much fun that I don't even care about the slow leveling. &lt;3
---
If you enjoy seeing your healer drink to full after every pull and go oom if you pull slightly more then expected or someone makes a mistake then yes, go ahead. Also you're now forced to only join groups at a higher level then you could do with a shield. 
---
The difference between shield and no shield is quite significant. I'd say about 30%-40% less damage taken. 
---
Fair warning, if you're not in full T1 in Stratholme or Scholo and want to leave your shield at home I'll either kick you or leave the group. I'm sick and tired off begging the rng goods to keep your ass alive while using potions and emergency spells on cooldown. 
---
I want a tank, not a rogue-knockoff that you can get by the boatload in IF.
---
Shouldn't retail wow be better fit for those players?
---
I mean casual players are not going to see all of the content anyhow, and there's nothing wrong with that
---
Catch up how? Only 2 of the items that drop in Dire Maul are even better than non-Dire Maul dungeon items for a rogue. You still have to grind out all the other high-end dungeons for gear, too.
---
I play on Mograine and everyone i've encountered so far is super nice. Of course there will always be assholes out there but yeah from my experience so far i haven't met a single rude person. Just lucky i guess.
---
uhh you do realize with fiery they die a lot more faster than with crusader.. thus no need to friggin heal so your point is moot
---
&gt; How many pots do you use on the average pull? I spend 4g in pots a pull, minimum. 
---
The context here is 5-man dungeons. I sincerely hope you aren't using 4g in pots a pull for 5mans as that would be flat out silly. 
---
&gt; I spend 30-40g in a raid night on consumables just to make sure others dont die. If you wanna pay for a single round of consumables for a pull I'll gladly get your repairs for the entire night.
---
Again, the context is 5man dungeons, so I don't know why are you talking about raid nights and the consumes you would use. Even **IF** that was the context, you are acting like *only* tanks use consumes that cost money, which is also flat out silly.
---
My best so far was 3 Eye of Shadow, Skullflame Shield &amp; an Alcor's Razor in one night of farming
---
What stance dance macro?
---
This guy P(E)s
---
It has NEVER been VC. Get it into your head
---
You're right, those abilities that give them massive amounts of armor and HP, and ability to generate high levels of threat and a taunt to boot, really make them underwhelming and hard to value as a tank. (methinks you need to take your own advice and stop believing in hearsay).
---
Hold to door?
---
Hold the boat?
---
Hobor? HOBOR!
---
Pyrewood EU, should be the biggest EU PvE Server. I've seen people LF Scholo for 3 hours. Either you have all relevant roles in your guild (at 60) or you're screwed.
---
Both are mostly unnecessary, but if you have to invest into something, I suggest scorch. It has a use on its own as it is a decent finisher and can be used in pvp as well.
---
Gotta run around and find a priest, shaman or paladin. It's there to cement the need for other people in the world. That said, it's fucking ridiculous.
---
Most likely until most people are 60
---
Alright. How do I level a warrior? I'm having a hard time right now, I just hit level  20. I got the rare hammer in DM, which is good, but I still die a lot. I got all the quests done in Westfall and now I'm in Redridge trying to finish it, but mobs are basically shitting on me. I am so slow to level up. Any tips or things that might have gone over my head? I'm doing two handed fury right now.
---
This! The community perception of how difficult warrior lvling is is exaggerated.
---
Most likely it will just be am announcement about Classic's success so far and thst P2 will be released a week after blizzcon.
---
Sunder Armour
---
If you prioritize mount over gear I don't want you in my raid group.
---
Sounds harsh but I think it's fair. Luckily I found a guild with the same priorities.
---
That's one class. The caster items in DM are insane.
---
It's because low level dungeons give no real punishment to the dps if they pull aggro.  
---
It all ends at about Mara/ST when people realise that they WILL DIE if they pull aggro.
---
Got Smite's hammer on my first dm run and tbh it still feels like I'm struggling to kill mobs near my level.
---
Sure plenty of the casual classic playerbase isn't aware of archeage unchained, and that's why this reddit post it's full of their complains.
---
But you can be sure the more hardcore MMO players arround are fully aware of it and most of this players probably are on the lvl 60 bracket and have already done all classic content there is now, and archeage it's a pretty fking good MMO ( my point of view ofc ) and specially to hard core play it.
---
Basically they did this to make players that intended to try archeage to stay. Fking over all the casual playerbase.
---
&gt; I've never heard of anyone wanting others to pay for their water. That seems so dumb that it seems like a lie/exaggregation from your part (and if it isnt I'd be even more surprised).
---
I've seen it a couple of times, personally. Granted, compared to the amounts of dungeons I've been through it's not significant. But it *has* happened on several occasions. 
---
&gt; If I am about to head for a dungeon run while not having a mage in the group, I just snag a random mage and buy 4-5 stacks from him for 1g. Makes it cheap.
---
And I've seen countless times (just on Classic) where people show up to dungeons without any water. Thankfully, I'm a Mage so I can alleviate that issue for free.
---
Congratulations bro! Is it just timing/coincidence or is the level up effect an arrow and I have just never noticed?
---
Dire Maul was released way before most people on EU were 60 and it wasn't a problem and no one cried back then. 
---
What's happening with the whiners now is literally just FOMO, which is funny considering most of them also turn around and do the "kids these days..." thing.
---
charge, rend, intercept, rend, bloodrage, sweeping strikes, berserker rage, whirlwind, cleave, cleave, FRANTICALLY SPAMMING HEALTH POTION and I'm dead because I was being Billy Big Balls and I pulled too many Murlocs
---
I just got mine.. 1200~g + 200g crafting fee.
---
That's a normal price.
---
That's pretty lucky. You normally get a green from that.
---
Paladin tanks that buff SoS have 0 Problem to hold aoe aggro vs mages though.
---
How?
---
Druid is imo one of the more 'mechanically intense' characters to master.  
---
I suggest sticking to warlock, but if you can muster the effort to get over the stigma against healing you've put in your head (that all it is is clicking nameplates), I honestly think healing might be great for you. You never know til you try. I love healing as much as DPSing and all it took was a few dungeon runs.
---
hmm, i used sUF on retail, but, i didn't wanna get it (yet) until i was sure i wanted to stay with classic for a bit cuz i remember the initial setup being a PITA. i did get ZPerl since it's insanely easy to setup, but, i kind of do miss sUF.
---
It’s an arrow acknowledging that my social life can only go up from here
---
Way to burn the seas bro..
---
It doesn't make sense and never will. Its a bit like the human ego. Ahh... what is man but a miserable pile of secrets? \*throws a wine glass at the floor\*
---
Think of the exposure though
---
You can just use a positive condition, leave the "if"-part blank and just fill in the "else"-part.
---
For example:
---
instead of: /cast [swimming] Aquatic Form
---
do something like: /cast [swimming];Travel Form
---
Your class trainers will give them to you. They're pretty hard to miss.
---
Pretty sure you can just open a new window, yeah. Dyou not have one extra for tiny threat?
---
You know classic is also for sale, aka also retail? It is not a private server.
---
Guess I should post my unpopular opinions as well. 
---
A) This is a dick move, may as well farm just The Unforgiven in that case. It's pretty easy to get a group to just chain-run him for about an hour. 
---
B) I only take level 60s so we can skip a lot of packs we don't need to kill. It also reduces the risk of a quick 40 - 45 min run turning into "Can we please do quest A, B, C, D, E, F" run that takes twice the time. 
---
C) As a tank yes. It also depends on the wipe. Wipe at Drakki because both tanks got conflagged on the pull, Ok we try again. Wipe on the first trash rooms because half the group stood outside the room, after being told twice to get inside and got knockbacked into the other rooms, or wipe on the packs before the arena because DPS was too busy nuking split targets and not killing the caster, may be a good reason to leave. 
---
D) If you've done the dungeon 20+ times and are just there for one item from a boss, then why waste time on clearing unnecessary trash? 
---
E) After 20+ runs, if I only need 1 item, and you could improve every gear slot as part of the run, better bet that I'll reserve the one thing I need.  You are DPS, and not even max level DPS, you can be replaced in 3 minutes. You would have an easier time finding a group and the XP you need if you take whatever you can get. Most of us did not get our BIS item on the first or even 10th run, but we upgraded gradually. So you may not get the Dal'Rends MH on your run, but you may get the emberfury talisman, and the offhand. 
---
F)  I don't care who is first in the DPS meters in dungeons or raids. I care that the group/raid has enough DPS to down the mobs and bosses at a reasonable, safe pace. I care that mages are decursing and counterspelling, that rogues are kicking casters, that DPS warriors are using pummel, and so on. I also care that DPS are not randomly zerging mobs, do not constantly pull mobs off me,  wait a few seconds before starting their nukes and use their cooldowns responsibly. 
---
Toxicity is a question of definition, and context. I don't consider anything except A to be unilaterally toxic. In getting my pre-raid BIS, I've done: 
---
40+ runs in BRD (15 - 20 full clears, and 20 - 30 Angerforge/Arena/Golemlord runs. 
---
20+ runs in Scholomance 
---
20+ runs in Stratholme UD 
---
10 runs in Strat live 
---
20+ runs in LBRS 
---
20+ runs in UBRS 
---
At this point, I'm looking to group with people who are in a similar situation, they have most of their BIS gear, they know the dungeon, all quests in there are done (except maybe a quick hand-in at Vael or something), they know how to play their class in a group, they don't really need a ton of loot so most of the blues can be vendored to go towards repairbills, raid prep or epic mount, and the runs are clean so I don't end up 4 - 5g in the negative from taking a hefty repair bill.
---
I actually have a hard time believing this. That is at least 50 runs.
---
Where tf is Chestnutz when you need him.
---
Overpower Procs, misses, misses, misses, misses, you ded
---
Glückwunsch!
---
What are you talking about? People were 60 the first month into the game just like they are now. 
---
Even in private servers where it was overtuned people were clearing Ragnaros on day 5 and 6, why does everyone pretend like this game was hard?
---
At release the game was laughed at for being too easy from the Ultima and EQ crowds.
---
I'd go with what the guy below said, I'm almost 60 but I haven't found the need for it yet. Maybe for pvp and hardcore raid progression it'd be good but other than not not super necessary. I'm about to start leveling herb though, dropped LW (skinning is my other) cause I gave up on crafting my own devilsaur set, impossible to farm on my server for the leathers and I'd still have to buy the recipe so I figured might as well just do herb for the thistle tea mats + fadeleaf for blind powder
---
cc is a waste of time in 2019. everything can be kited and aoe down
---
same here :I
---
I didn't find SUF that difficult to set up tbh. I used ElvUI (which overhauls pretty much everything), spent a couple of hours to revert most overhauls and was still unhappy - then got SUF instead and did maybe 15-30 min setup. So happy I did now, it's very minimalistic and clean now.
---
Sometimes aoe'ing packs comes without any form of danger and is just way faster.

Not all mages are tards.

Funny how  "cum"  is Romanian for  "how"  so it creates funny situations when i just  nonchalantly  ask my friend "how"  during  a conversation and confusion is created by the he censored word

Let me introduce to you;
---
Tanking with my Palla!
---
We get the benefit of the repair bill AND the water bill!
---
There's no such phase existing.
---
ummm yea besides shadowstrike but maybe ur a noob who doesnt do MC so u wouldnt know
---
That's basically implying that the group would skip the beast if they didn't have a skinner
---
If you're like me, you don't. You try, but you never find it, or it gets taken away from you again and again.
---
15 years, and I still play alone.
---
Wtf...
---
Gosh, you sound fun.
---
Fuck you Blizzard you communist supporting fucktards.
---
If you’re not even 60 yet or close you’re pretty garbo at leveling.
---
No as in changes stance depending on combat condition.
---
Basically its 3 Makros on the same keybinds on all 3 stance. 
---
The logic is something like this. 
---
While in battle stance: if combat &gt; berserker stance ;else charge
---
In defensive stance: if combat &gt; berserker stance ;else battle stance
---
In berserker stance: if combat &gt; intercept ;else battle stance
---
Are you sure you're not noticing that most BiS lists are for different phases? I'm sure that at some point one of them has +hit pieces. IDK.
---
Windows only show different types of information. The segments are chosen globally. That's simply the way it works. If you need both, you'll most likely have to install a second epeen meter.
---
Why do people feel the need to make these kinds of statements.  It's like.... no one cares, no one will miss you, you are not special.
---
I feel like I always see EU4 in this context. And I can truly understand it. There has been no other game for me that I've looked up "a few minutes later" and seeing that the sun has come and gone. I got a friend to play it and I didn't hear from him for a whole day and night, and just got a text message in the morning with "what the fuck dude".
---
Not especially. I like the older models better. The new ones are kind of ridiculously over-animated.
---
Bought out the AH of them at 7g a pop, flipped them now the miniumum price is 50g.
---
Check his gear and get him an upgrade, or buy him a rare pet like a whelpling.
---
It was never going to be more than a phase. DM is the only non-raid content that's going to come out. Eventually Classic will be "over", just like most pServers. pServers would just reset and start over, but Classic will simply dwindle as people quit/return to retail.
---
You have less than 0 social life to have a 10 day playtime in the 40 days the game has been out.
---
Im at 6 days and am certainly above average, probably by a sizable margin.
---
that's what i feared. what a waste of implementing such a robust window tool only to lack real implementation. oh well.
---
but thanks. i'll look into finding another mod.
---
Does +4 stats to chest exist in the game yet? Wowhead says it does, but I haven't been able to find anybody with it and I've been looking for almost a week now. Maybe it's just super rare?

What you could do, without swapping gear and losing damage:

use lesser mana oil on your weapon(s) -&gt; 8mp5 per oil. Use the food buff from sagefish delight (6m/5)
---
There's also shard of the scale from Ony (16mp5), but I'm not sure if you're too high on the prio list for that.
---
You can also get mana regen on wrist (enchant), but I think it's pricey.
---
I just get water from a mage and drink up.
---
&gt; There are so many things wrong with your comment, I am having trouble where to begin.
---
you are comparing aoe farming to single target farming - that's why you are having "trouble where to begin" reading my comment. no need to over exaggerate, just relax.
---
the point I was trying to make is that farming essences (like water for example) is so simplistic and easy that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. there are no resists to worry about, you never have to control your mana, gems, you never have to place blizzards, novas, etc. you just click on a mob and then kill with fireball/scorch (if immune to frost). that's all there is to it.
---
of course it isn't as efficient, but there are times where I am lazy as hell and I want to pay close to no attention to the monitor that is running WoW. 
---
"with essences there is close to zero chance of you dying" should have gave it away that I'm not chasing 'efficiency'. there is an avenue for farming 30-40g an hour with essences that requires such little attention. 
---
that's all. if you have trouble where to begin responding to this then let me know and I'll try and simplify it for you if need be.
---
Not trying to be a bummer but if you dont like endless grinding then classic may not be for you... its literally one big grind. From leveling to acquiring gear all you do in classic besides pvp is grind.
---
I've a lvl 36 warrior and it is rough. First aid helps with downtime. In my opinion you should focus on killing mobs below your level, they are easier to hit. So maybe you need to find another place to lvl. Maybe go to Darkshore and then rerurn to redridge after a few lvls
---
This dude in my guild was all like "lol this dude got mad cause I didnt tip him for an enchant he did with my mats. All he does is sit in IF all day, I see no reason to tip him when I did all the work".
---
Nah dude. He took the time to level the profession so he could PROVIDE you with a service. It was an enchant for his BIS item at that. Now I'm seeing people charging for enchants with your mats automatically. 
---
If you dont wanna tip, level the profession yourself.
---
&gt; once better dungeons 
---
Like which ones ?  
---
Only DM comes out....
---
EU Mograine aswell. Looks like they closed another layer or two
---
Yeah doing that you definitely won't get him. The best bet is just the brute Force method. Sit in the water until you either kill him or know when he died and then sit in the water the entire window that he is up.
---
Ive farmed epic mount, lionheart helm, devilsaur and currently farming for disarm gloves which is currently like 1k gold in mats. Altough ive done alot of dungeons/boosting friends that has not yielded that much gold which mightve added a few days
---
tanking in dungeons does not mean having threat on every single mob 100% of the time...
---
you can't/shouldn't Dual wield tank in phase 1. the gear for healers and for a tank isn't good enough. nor do you need to with DPS not coming close to what they'll be able to scale up to. The whole point of dual wield tanking is to maintain threat when mages are hitting for 2k+ on fireballs every 3 seconds.  at the mc lvl that isn't happening.
---
Classic wowhead has a guide that covers tailoring in great detail.  
---
At level 20 you can go to Undercity to learn expert tailoring. Hope that helps!
---
Being sarcastic is always fun to the person being sarcastic. Probably also fun to a lot of spectators. Almost NEVER to the one the sarcasm is directed at. If someone asks for help, any decent person will not reply sarcastically, it's that simple. One can have fun in other ways without insulting someone else.
---
try farming Dal'rends
---
You could easily hit 60 within 3-4 weeks, without no-lifing anything. Most people are just really slow and disorganized.
---
2h Fury is fine for now, you should respec to Arms latest at 40 for Mortal Strike though. An argument can be made for respeccing at 30 for Sweeping Strikes. 
---
Key is never fighting mobs that are higher level than you. Ideally mobs are green and quests barely still yellow for you. Anything above your level is a nightmare, because while you can still kill single mobs at your level and maybe +2, but it's always close and your down time for regen kills your time efficiency. This means you want to jump zones, a lot. You can't just "wrap it up" and do the few orange quests you got left like you would with other classes.
---
On Horde side, I followed this guide https://classicwow.live/leveling. If you throw in a dungeon run or two every time a new dungeon pops up, you'll always be like 1-2 levels ahead of the guide, which is where you want to be roughly. There are tons of other guides that will do similar things for you. 
---
In terms of rotation, if you still use it, forget about heroic strike. Use Charge, Rend, Sunder Armor while your target is above roughly 50% or to 5 stacks, then punch him to death with auto attacks while saving rage for the next mob. Use Overpower whenever possible. Only use heroic strike to dump rage when it's the last mob you kill before eating anyways. Only Execute if the fight is close, you'll have to eat after the mob, or you are at roughly 15 rage. Don't massively overkill mobs with a 40 rage execute, that rage is precious for the next mob.
---
why do they say 'stun the target' then?
---
No joke, in second half of TBC I mained a female undead warrior and people would not stop on asking me why do I keep on jumping when tanking. I did no jumping... just the character made flips.
---
As time went by, the animation kept increasingly bugging me so much that I race changed to female orc in wotlk...
---
Actually I do 😂 but that’s my RP
---
there's an area in DM East where there's a bunch of lashers that you can AoE down and farm. there's also dogs that you can kite up and down ramps/railings. there's a few rich thorium veins you can also nab as well... and a few things i'm sure i'm forgetting.
---
You just have to be careful
---
Filthy keyboard turner
---
I'm kinda surprised at how many people actually think this way. It will never be faster to solo kill quests. Not only will you be killing mobs slower, you will be competing for mobs  with the people you wouldn't party with. You can try to rationalize it any way you want, but in the end it's an extremely selfish play style that benefits no one. Not to mention you end up on a lot of people shit lists.
---
The answer was in my first sentence.
---
"The difference is, anyone can pick up skinning if they so wish"
---
Picking rogue comes with lockpicking. Its part of what that class brings to the table. Just like mages bring consumeables.
---
If you want to skin beasts, pick skinning. The choice is pretty easy.
---
This is too true...
---
OTOH, it would require blizzard to expose all of the available items on the AH which would kind of demystify the game
---
Feign death, pop a freezing trap. Run away. If you want to fight them, run away and get distance, and open up on them with aimed shot and then a quick serpent sting so they can't vanish. Immediately concussion shot as they will likely use sprint and continue running away with aspect of the cheetah on. When they get close, or they stop moving turn off aspect of the cheetah immediately as this means they are about to throw a dagger or a bomb at you which will daze you. Oh and yeah send your pet on them, but not until you've broken your own trap.
---
I've heard that there is a delay for Hunters between feigning and setting traps that needs fixed, so I don't know if this is possible. If you can't trap them, you can't counter a rogue, no way in hell. If a rogue attacks you, you're very likely dead. They were known for being incredibly OP in classic, its no different now. Good luck!
---
I think he meant turmeric
---
I've like 6.5 days played on my hunter. I'm focusing on getting him to 60. He's herb/alch and doing well.
---
My alt is a lv 11 mage. I'd like to level this mage since they seem to deal way more damage and kill mobs faster, even though they don't have a pet.
---
The thorium ammo is going for over 2g a stack on my server, so I'd really need a miner/engi, but the mage will prob go tailoring/enchanting. Oh well :)
---
That's it for now
---
I find it funny and pathetic that you'd be defending this type of player/game play. You literally think you could level a priest from 1-60 only ever have used Renew and Mind control, gimme a break, I know people are brain dead on wow forums but didn't think this was infected by them yet.
---
We want bgs now. Even for casuals before 60, it’s great fun. I think they’ll drop them in phase 2.
---
A lot of other dungeons suddenly become a lot less relevant, which makes it harder to find groups. If private server DM farming strategies still work, the economy will change quite a lot giving everyone able to already farm there a huge advantage.
---
Play with deal on a server you’are , it pvp.
---
nah, I tanked all content back then, I'm planning on doing the same this time.
---
ggMon
---
they still do, or at least, I always ask if there are other people who can skin the beast during the run and set up rules beforehand
---
I just want to point out that it's all based on your opinion and not actual numbers so it's hard to argue against. 
---
Anyway. I hope you have fun in Archmage :)
---
Heads up, you can create a group of 5-6 players that does 5 Jed runs per hour rather easily.
---
Everyone will have truestrike and Briar by the end of a night. Its not really that big of a deal.
---
I always did this buying anything in Eve.
---
It's the way a lot of mages level. Both in dungeons and outside. Spellcleaving dungeons has become such a huge thing in classic that I reckon a lot of mages just think it's the best in most situations or are just so used to it that they don't really know how to play their class properly.
---
I see so many mages in PvP just jump around spamming arcane explosion. Even against warriors.
---
Stand in Darnassus and sell portals to Stormwind. You'll be amazed at how much you can make during peak times.
---
yeah warlocks are pretty good in general for leveling
---
All of those I did not know of, I only knew about solo tribute runs as hunter.
---
Ever 10-15 minutes you get 10-20gold worth of blues and greens it seems, pretty damn good.

Now corrupt it for 10% MS
---
You can pick up bs too to open a chest, that logic does not really hold up
---
As someone who enjoys healing the most I feel your views on how it feels like based on watching some videos might be a bit skewed.
---
Optimizing your healing-strategy for limting the amount of mana-breaks you need, avoiding overheal all the while not making it too risky and keeping track what's going on, aiding with killing mobs etc. is quite a fun thing to do. It's what I thought of first when I read "I like to rely on thinking and strategy rather than pure mechanics." because that's what it feels like to me.
---
As a healer you most likely push the fewest buttons of all classes throughout a fight. But from a decision-making-point of view it's pretty neat. Spend more mana to be safer? Before Maraudon you usually get away with inefficient play too and just have to drink more. But in the higher-level dungeons your decisions, and not your mechanical skill make the difference between success and failure.
---
Where was your pocket pakky?
---
I mean, a 1% increased chance to hit with a yellow attack would mean 1.01 * (white hit damage which might be ~50-60%, counting poisons &amp; procs) which translates into roughly a 0.5-0.6% damage increase per hit chance.
---
You did a full BRD run but thinking of doing the MC attunement? Should have done it in that full run! Try finding a group to speed run to Emp and get the attunement at the same time - lava run possible there.
---
Do LBRS for more BiS and clearing those quests from your log (great XP) and do some Winterspring stuff - some group quests and nice grind quests there. Run some more LBRS and once gotten some levels, move to EPL and UBRS/scholo/strat runs for quests and more gear.
---
Got to t12-13 maps with a memey sire of shards fork fireball miner. The tower D content is pretty cool, but blighted maps arent that common and really dip your fps.
---
He's a keyboard warrior, he assumes he can do what he actually can't. Paladins wreck most melee classes. Its not impossible for a warrior to beat a paladin, but its not easy or something you can guarantee. Paladins have like 3 health bars, Warriors have one. They don't actually dish out more burst than a paladin either, just more DPS. The HP wins out usually.
---
Goal? Thats just the begining
---
If the skinner gets the hide it's the same to the rest of the be group as no one getting anything.
---
Boomer screams at clouds
---
DM.
---
for Dire Maul, you use DM West/East/Tribute.
---
As I read this at 1:40 AM...
---
wow people really did not like your joke lmao
---
Ok but people will always want to roll for chests even though you levelled a profession to be able to open the locks. Like there is no way if you're a blacksmith that you get the chest without rolling for it.
---
The last time I levelled a toon (Legion), those Ogres still hit hard as fuck with full plate heirlooms. The second to last boss is a nightmare.
---
I've played since classic launch, but I couldn't decide what to play, my main from retail or try something new, lvl a warrior to 29, a shaman to lvl 24 and a priest to lvl 11 before I said fuck it ill level my class from retail.  So currently a lvl 17 rogue and having a blast!  First time playing original classic too!
---
Yeah except these items don't last until 60, don't give any xp boost and don't scale in stats what so ever.
---
Dam, this is fast, I am only level 39 with \~6 days played, I've been playing every chance I can get too. Feel like i need to take vacation days to catch up!
---
Not everyone lives to be exceptional!
---
Yes, we speed run emp and didnt do my attonement but i had to leave at the end since it was later
---
you could transmog them for as long as transmogging has existed,

---
Ok so if there was a blacksmith in the group and they could open the chest, you think people would be fine just giving it to him straight up? I've never seen that happen, ever.
---
I'm looking to move servers from Arcanite Reaper since the population is pretty darn low.
---
I am unsure of which server to pick but ideally I want a server that's PST, with a high population (not sure if queue times are bad), PvP, and that's a little more competitive.
---
What's the deal with wind serpents, i see tons of Hunter's with them and i want to know if i should get one. Currently stabled pvp/dps cat, buff Wolf and third is a general farming owl with screech.
---
 People always say wind serpents don't die in raids but they still have to get into melee range to melee, even the breath is only 20 yards and you don't get max rank until zg. So what's the benefit?
---
You should be able to start running east at 50+ as a holy priest.
---
It's ironic that you're calling them snowflakes when it seems like you're the one that's easily offended and expect everybody to live up to your standards
---
just google classic wow "stancedance marcos" you should find stuff like intercept &amp; charge macros and all the other good stancelocked stuff
---
What do you think would be a better fit then: Paladin or Priest?
---
Almost all heirlooms give #% exp bonus’ so... I’m not sure why you’d ever replace them.
---
You shouldnt need that much rage for sunder armor spam, which is the best lvling method.
---
My friend leveled a Warrior with the herbalist and alchemy professions, that guy was unstoppable. You don't realise how useful they are until you see a warrior not needing any heals because they have +20 armor and +5 health regen.
---
Sarcasm =/= insulting
---
Drop rates used to annoy me back in the day. They don't anymore. Everytime a quest starts to take a little too long I remember that I'm not in a hurry, and it will drop eventually. Its not like I'm farming a legendary or something. Its not a big deal.
---
Also, I love the game, so those bad drop rates hurt far, far less then the years of disappointing changes made by Blizzard.
---
definitely isn’t useless, it’s a general zone order. You need your hand held and told exactly when to move onto the next zone buddy?
---
Are you aware of the goblins Sub? Its all about making money, friend.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wowgoblins/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowgoblins/)
---
That should be the Blizzard master plan, launch phase 2 shortly before 8.3 and watch everyone flock to your main game because classic is an unplayable shitshow.
---
this probably means the honor system will arrive even later, maybe late december-january?
---
i like the water but that's about it
---
Yeaaa my dwarf shaman blasting throught the first 100 lvls in retail wants to have a word with you.
---
Lol, oh yea know that one well. Was easier back in 1st expac on my pally, shammy doesnt do so well.
---
Is it possible to just move away from a low pop server? I thought they had to be high population
---
6 days played and lvl 39.. you need to be more efficient with your time, not spend more of it
---
Meanwhile I’m still level 25.
---
I mean create a new character.
---
Don't make him go to any Slavic/Russian-speaking country. Drizzt is very similar to "dristat" which is a slang for diarrhea. That's why in Russian DnD we know him as Dzzirt.
---
I guess the better way to put it was everything needed to be worked for. A good example is how literally the whole raid needs Ony Scale cloaks in BWL..which requires a maxed skinner who also has a enchant and a special item to even make it, or the attunement quests to get into raids. Were these things hard? Not necessarily for all of them, but it made you work for them. I do understand though why they would be scrapped when BC came out since they were then not endgame content, but they should always have things like that in the endgame.
---
What's wrong with playing as a cow...?
---
Though I don't know how ally can manage play druid tbh
---
It might be a close knit guild discord? I would consider it good manners to announce it, especially if you're part of a raiding team.
---
ah, not sure then, sorry.
---
My whole guild is full of old people with kids and wives and 90% have hit 60
---
Value certainly does change things.
---
Someone finding a dollar bill on the subway, no one cares Someone finds a suitcase with a million bucks in it on the subway, suddenly it's a legal matter.
---
I know the feeling. Undead is best for style, but the Orc is best for PvP. Rogues and Warriors are your biggest worry and Orc racial stun resist helps against both of those. Undead's WOTF does little to nothing in that regard :(
---
Replaces action bars. It's quite light and very easy to customize.
---
Got it first run on my pally and won among other 2 warrs.
---
7 runs so far on my warrior, nothing
---
What you want is how i have it set up.
---
Click options on one window and on the bottom right of the main settings page you should have the option to choose what box you’re editing
---
Pug groups always roll on valuable shit. I used to skin the beast in vanilla and everyone would /roll. Ruining your reputation for 300g, bold strategy.
---
Yes, it's a really rare drop. 
---
But we there's an enchanter on our server with it
---
Take skinning/mining or skinning/herbalism then switch
---
The journey starts at 60.
---
Mind Sooth, Mind Control, one invis potion and dots.
---
Better gear makes it "easy"/quicker.
---
I stopped playing with/during/after WotLK  
---
(played a bit of Wod and Legion but its crap)  
---
I want to play Classic for now.  
---
No interest in retail anymore, so not wasting money on that.  
---
Also no interest in TBC..... please let me just play Classic, its out for about a month now... no hurries.
---
&gt; Even if your healer is trash with mana, you can Innervate them and throw HoTs out to DPS in between pulls to keep the run going faster.
---
This made the main difference for me, as a healer. Druid tank A) takes damage in more predictable way and B) could innervate me to keep on going (mainly as a priest).
---
Kinda wondering if my 5man multiboxing tank should still have been a druid. Oh well, not that i had problems going on as a warrior (and going to levelup a druid in any case later).
---
look forward to it mate, it really opens up the class and makes it feel so much more
---
The priest was the idiot by far
---
Fuck oath. He instigated the whole thing. Who cares if someone wants to sell a gear run. People like me with no one to play with will buy it.
---
Ive heard it wont come out p4. Long time
---
now you know how smokers felt 20 years ago...
---
Yo, smoke.
---
Uh...no.
---
Fuck you man, it's just a smoke.
---
Yep. My smoke.
---
[Yes, it is a passive disarm that has nothing to do with batching](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=14178/sticky-tar)
---
&gt; Everyone drops off and the servers die. 
---
Pservers has proven this hasnt been the case for the last 15 years, so why would that change ?  
---
People wont drop off... not in much numbers atleast
---
Never in the history of the entire game has anybody ever brought a rogue to a dungeon solely to unlock a chest.  Sometimes they come in order to unlock a door, but nobody ever says "there's a locked chest somewhere in the instance so let's kick this mage and invite a rogue so he can open it".
---
p.s. a blacksmith can open chests too, and anyone can pick up blacksmithing if they so wish.
---
Mages jobs are DPS
---
Healers jobs are Healing
---
Mages are not vendor machines/portal casters contrary to popular belief. Those are class utilities not class roles

I don't understand all the people crying that it's too soon and it's going to trivialise content. Raiding is already easy, few additional items won't change that. Also, even if you played vanilla back in the days, most of you probably never experienced it without dire maul. Especially if you're from EU. WoW was launched on 11 February and patch 1.3 (including DM and world bosses) came out 7th of March - that's not even a month.

His tag says horde priest, so probably no bonebiter, but nonetheless I would go for ww axe because you can get it at 30, and I doubt you would get a cathedral grp or the quest for bonebiter at that level. Just ask people who farm those trolls to group with them and say you only want the tusks. I had a bunch of people help me that way at 30

&gt; Orgrimmar
---
First one to spell Orgrimmar right. :D
---
&gt; I got this thing back in 2007 a few weeks before tbc released
---
At that point everyone could buy rank 14 gear. I remember resubbing just to get my rogue decked out in epics.
---
So ... you can demand anything but straight up gold? 
---
"I'm not a prostitute, I only take gold necklaces from my ... visitors!"
---
How would you roll on this though. If you’re two people who need the item, how can you say “okay you need on one, I need on the other”? Like, will the same item display on top for both players? I’d be so stressed lol.
---
People come home from their shitty 9-5 jobs where their boss yells at them, their coworkers don’t talk to them, and they barely get paid, so they take out some of that stress.
---
You're right to your opinions. Not that I agree with them, or share your view of how to play the game.
---
Mind sharing your ingame char nicknames? I'd like to avoid grouping with you, if possible.
---
Yeah but it's good for cleaving adds that wont be fully debuffed and good for dungeons and super good for pvp. It's not the ideal single target weapon, but I'd much rather have BRE than any other weapon for those other reasons.
---
Nah, you're alright
---
This game aint retail kid loot can be a pain to get, havent missed a single raid lock out since week 2, only got 3 items.
---
Blizzard is HEAVILY in the Chinese market and has been for years.   This isn't even a choice for them the kind of damage china could do would destroy them.
---
You’re talking about an absolute hardcore base on Private Servers, compared to a mix of hardcore and retail casuals that have to justify the monthly sub cost on official servers. Completely different groups and both are required to make it worthwhile for Blizzard to keep all of the servers running
---
SAVE IT IN YOUR BANK TILL BGS COME

elemental is for level 60, ench for level
---
What class did she pick?
---
There is nothing enjoyable about Classic WoW's PvP gameplay. It's so broken, clunky and one-sided, it's mostly just a waste of time.
---
Too many epics dropping. Many reports on Baron mount/Felstriker/Runeblade etc this early in the game
---
Following out of interest. Might just have my 60 follow the lowbie whilst I quest and not focus on killing as many mobs.
---
Post pls?
---
Tbh it feels like your perception of current classic wow is out of space. It's not a hard game where you have to dedicate your life to in order to play it properly and reach the end game content.
---
You're not doomed to play a healer as a hybrid class. You're more likely to see a feral druid than a healer.
---
You don't have to spend 40h a week to gear up your tank. Considering everyone looks for tanks these days, gearing up will be easy. You also don't have to compete with all the overly played classes for gear, like mages/warlocks and all healers combined. Same in end game content. An item drops and literally 20+ people roll on it.
---
sorry
---
Dire Maul has a lot of pretty high quality gear, making a bunch of other stuff obsolete. Catch up mechanics are great for people, that got unlucky in the existing content, not if the majority didn't even get a chance to see and experience that content first.
---
In private servers, people have developed ways to farm a lot of gold and materials in DM, if that works in classic as well, it will have a huge impact on the economy. This wasn't a massive factor in vanilla wow, solo farming DM was a niche maybe a few ppl could/would do.
---
Its groups tired of spamming for a tank. If offering a tip gets a tank to drop what they're doing and join then win win. Havent seen anyone demand payment yet.
---
That time has already arrived if you're talking about low level dungeons, its nearly impossible these days to find any lower level dungeon groups that arent dm, sm or zf, unless you're in a big social/levelling guild.
---
Everything from brd and up will always be ran regularly forever. brd, strat, scholo, ubrs all provide certain extremely rare drops that will make even full t2+ players still occasionally run them, rare recipes, baron mount, ironfoe/hoj, or even just the dark runes from scholo as endgame raid consumables. Dire Maul tribute runs are extremely fast and decent money with good groups even if they dont need loot (or especially then), and are also often done just to get those buffs before a raid. The only dungeons that eventually get harder to find groups for once most players have all their gear are lbrs and dm east &amp; west. But players also keep creating new alts and have to gear up again.
---
That's still a lot of leveling! You've come a long ways, too. I wouldn't be where I'm at now if it weren't for my guild.

You do a coffer run in a group. I did one 2 days ago for fire resistance librams. You can do like so: arena to make top not hostile, then back on top of arena, go to the other side (next to the Loregian guy) and clear a path to coffers. Do the coffer guard boss, if you have keys you can do the bonus one. Open the painting to see who is the dark keeper and depending on name find and kill. One is on the area, one can be along the way etc. Next open dark coffer and whoever needs stuff for librams can check the loot box. It drops 2x of it loot table so not always you will get what you want.
---
Yeah they're good til a mid 40s quest.
---
That's the point. He's trying to force the lock to drink because a lot of locks just never bother to drink "because I can just tap", which wastes a ton of the healer's mana.
---
With how you talk I doubt we'd ever be in the same group anyway, I have a standards when grouping with people. I typically avoid lfr/wq players and usually they get phased out/removed fairly quick.
---
But she does use here stuff, the aoe , the throw, the fear. So that seems odd. I have also seen wolves doing that, which do not have such abilities.
---
I tried installing it and it didn't work. I'm using other addons, its just that one that doesn't seem to work
---
Leveling with dual wield sucks... there is a reason all the warriors who got to 60 quickly used 2h.
---
Dont you only need one arcanite bar?
---
My guild had 2 Felstrikers on UBRS run two weeks ago
---
Last person who needed it roll dead last after like the 9th roll to work it out

---
I ain't fucking sharing my fadeleaf from SM with all these non-herbalists - no way!
---
Okay, my bad. I'm in Europe so don't know about the timezones of the servers, but maybe just pick a server that has high population on your peak playing time. This means that there's a decent amount of players but it's not full, so you avoid queues
---
&gt; Rushing out content shortens life span of content
---
Bullshit. Forcing people to wait will only make them leave.
---
Nope, and definetely dont need this to help me choose where to go.
---
But you cant make it be general and work for both factions, its gonna do a disservice to someone who will actually need/use it
---
Would love something like this still.
---
Im 57 atm and only leveling through questing and dungeons here and there, I give a gold to the mage for water and food thats gonna last me 10+ hours of grinding
---
Ye thats because those abilities dont requiere anyone to be in melee afaik.
---
Also its boe, so if the other guy isn't a ninja they can just trade it
---
Which doesn't really matter when you realize it's still equivalent to MC gear. You'll be using it all the way to 60.
---
There's literally only Dire Maul being added as a 5-man and yes, that replaces a lot of other dungeon loot, but people will still always run the others. Don't worry.
---
Spell hit and crit are more important.
---
I cant be the only one who finds warriors easy to level? I can kill like 3 mobs my level before needing to eat. Even when you agro too many mobs I just change to defensive stance and run away or use intimidating shout.
---
Executioner's Cleaver is better anyway.
---
You can't that's my point, they have to be in party to shield someone
---
You seem to have a healthy relationship, but I think you're projecting your own behavior on the guy in the image. 
---
In truth, neither of us know how much he played, but I think if he's saying it 'affected his work and social life", then he wasn't just "spending one weekend on the game", he's far more likely to have done nothing but live and breathe the game until he made that post. 
---
1.5 months of ignoring your SO for a video game is a long time, not cool. Especially in a more casual relationship, as opposed to a marriage. I can easily see someone calling it quits over that and I don't think they'd be a bad person for doing so.
---
And likely some extra herbs for rogue and druids. Aside of that pure gold farming will create some inflation.
---
Worgen and Tauren?
---
What? This is a bit of a lame and uninformed excuse to explain something. Might as well say that God created the the Earth and mankind, as it is an easier explanation.
---
People do stuff because it yields rewards. If you camp someone you need to be rewarded in order to keep doing it. Currently that reward would be something like satisfaction which could stem from being a general douchebag, having psychological shortcomings or revenge. As that high level was not ganked by someone, lost his quest items to someone or was otherwise disturbed by the person he decides to camp, there is no revenge factor. Ergo, his satisfaction, and reason for keep doing what hes doing, his satisfaction, must be derived from elsewhere. The real reason for killing someone in a videogame has never ever been "it is a pvp game, ergo i must pvp". Sure, people have used it as an excuse where the real reason was a sense of satisfaction by roflstomping someone, grinding honour/reward points or otherwise benefitting in some way.
---
16 debuff slots instead of 8
---
That's a pretty informative post. I guess I learned something new here.
---
Its kinda cute that you'd think 19 hours grinding would be enough to hit exalted at any faction that was grind-based, but grats on the sinew.
---
Just subscribe on a US wow account?
---
I have a feeling you’re trying to jump thru hoops but you’re jumping thru the completely wrong ones.
---
Just google “how to play on US servers as European WoW”
---
LOOK AT THEM JUGGS! OH BOY

As a tank: The amount of time I spent looking for a mage as the last dps is far greater than the amount of time I spent looking for healers.
---
[Laughs in 10 Second Summon Felhunter Animation]
---
She is a rogue and I play a tank warrior to protect her ;)
---
Is BiS dps from lvl 10-&gt;19 for horde. ally have a 2h sword with slightly more dps but lower stats i think.
---
BRD Imo was one of the biggest losses when they brought in the new LFG. So many just do the jail house and leave.
---
I loved the whole exploration of the dungeon, the length, the Colosseum, and the tavern.
---
It's cool to level fast, but a lot of the enjoyment is lost. Imho, the journey there is pretty awesome too. I've had so many good moments already and I'm no where near level 60. So just relax and enjoy the game exactly the way you want.
---
Then we have found a use case for paladin tanks! I do agree though. Pallies would be incredible in strat, as they can just spec half holy half prot and heal themselves (only gargoyles silence/rupts) for unlimtied aggro. Mages would love them!
---
&gt; What should I do to make myself more appealing to guilds, other than the obvious finish pre-bis and finish stocking up on consumes?
---
Communicate. You "just being there" doesn't let anyone know about your intentions. Wow-Classic is very much about social-networking. So your skill must not be limited to the game-menchanical-aspects of it.
---
You surely weren't alone in the dungeons when you farmed your prebis. So you should have gotten to know quite a few people. If they know you are a good player, who is also friendly, relatable and reliable, then that is the key to get into their guild. And from there it's more social-networking. Make yourself a name within the guild and talk with whomever holds the strings.
---
Just being some guy with good gear and consumable but who barely communicates will most likely not be enough to become a MT.
---
Yes, aware that Blizzard enforces the competitive rules that it asks people to agree to when competing. Oh the horror
---
Oopsie-woopsie.
---
Bwizzad made a fucko-wucko again. UwU.
---
I'm afraid your guess is wrong.
---
Not OP, but saving these tips for alt :) Thanks a lot.
---
So let me see if I get this.. People who fell behind because of irl and/or wanting to experience the game in a differente pace (all good btw), are whining because new content that doesn't really affect them comes live sooner. Nice...  
---
If you want to always be ahead of the curve no matter how much time you invest, play BFA! It's great on that aspect!
---
You could also use professions like fishing, mining, skinning if you can get devilsaurs etc. As a Mage I rarely AoE farm for gold - no need.
---
Bad bot.
---
I always have some on hand but I always wait on the trade window til I see some gold. Especially for those types
---
15 years ago when I was xcore raiding, I would be genuinely happy for anyone in the guild to get an upgrade because this will increase our status of the guild in the server and enable us to progress through content.
---
I start leveling prot in 53, pretty good dmg, almost the same timing as arms killing mobs because i recieve a less dmg and can pull 3 when in arms was 1. Also i plan roll prot for engame and i already doing dungeons for bis so i stay prot questing.
---
/cast (stance name)
---
/equip (weapon name)

---
You go Glen Coco!
---
Indeed, but the poster said it was never designed for casuals, which was the complete opposite of what was the case.
---
Majority of my server isnt even 60. Multiple guilds have to collaborate together to even raid Onyxia and MC. This is way to soon IMO. Blizzard is dropping the ball big time. Part of me thinks they're being pressured to do this because all the streamers are 60 and talking about how bored they are.
---
It's also better than the class mount!

You gotta take into account the time when WoW first came out. Back then most MMOs had relatively simple tank and spank bosses, mechanics beyond that weren't really all that common. From todays point of view it's simple, but that's because nowadays we're used to mechanically complex bosses.
---
I'm gonna be honest though. I like all the good memes, but leveling a warrior isn't as bad as everyone makes it seem. Level your firstaid and cook foods that buff you, make/buy sharpeningstones and you're good to go tbh. 
---
Also remember, while leveling spirit is your best stat after plain weapon damage, because it reduces your downtime a lot.
---
Unit scan doesent work in retail classic so he might have spawned and u missed him
---
So everyone should wait on the slowest most casual players?
---
I have yet to find the Un'Goro soil. When I do, there will be a celebration.
---
Ah, I remember being 22ish after the first night on release, good times.
---
It's true- I'm in no rush. I spend a lot of my time exploring and seeing what I can interact with. It's such an extensive and beautiful game. I really had no idea what I was getting into and I am soooo blown away.
---
Well, originally DM came out about 1 month after Rag kill if I'm not mistaken. So the pace is just OK and DM items don't change the game that much, it will mainly change the economy.        
---
Don't compare it to the old times. Now, because of the streams, etc., you just get this inner feeling that you gotta keep up somehow.
---
Its Undercity, not Lordaeron. Better?
---
Get out of the passing lane.
---
I'm not concerned about TBC realms coming out, so much as I am about say for example Naxxramas which I heard (only heard, I have literally no clue if it's true or not) had gear on par with the starting equipment in TBC, making most stuff prior obsolete.
---
You are already miles behind dude you know there's people who have full pre raid bis and even legendary weapons right?
---
I am actually be efficient, but I'm doing a completionist route (completing every quest before it turned grey). That's what is taking so long, I plan to continue to do this to 60. I thought I would be able to take 3-4 months to hit 60 before phase 2, now i get the feeling things are going to be released at a faster pace.
---
Might have been someones 2nd account in the group. That someone played by alt tabbing.
---
we have option to turn on retail graphics?
---
venoxis (german)
---
full/high (mb 30min queue in the evening ond raid days most of the time you get in right away)
---
about 50/50 split on created characters
---
economy is fucked
---
enchaters are scarce yet they all work for shitty tg's 
---
im just selling my materials at this point to make any money off of it.
---
portions and elixirs are way overpriced
---
grindspots between lvl 45-60 are fucked (overrun either by 60s farming money or ppl trying to grind)
---
alliance always starts shit (mostly gnome casters and nightelf druids/ hunters) in contested areas and gets thier face bashed in after a few minutes and then continue to whine untill thier guildmates arrive who also get kicked in the nuts.
---
this escalates until they start pushing back horde, which is when they cry for help by guildies. when they arrive alliance usually gets pushed back, GY and Corpse camped for half an hours or whenever hordes get bored and wants to farm again.
---
for this reason Gnomes and nightelf are pretty much KoS and wont get any help from anyone around them.   
---
they know 90% of the time the gnome / Nelf is on a killlist and helping them would only escalate everything. they exchange /wave /greet whatnot with the horde corpsecamper and go about thier buisness uninterrupted.
---
People who aren't 60 by now are pretty casual players honestly. Do you really want them to dictate the progress of patches? I think this is a good change.
---
Do a full brd quest run and spam lbrs the rest of the way. Maybe do some quests while waiting for groups but as a healer it shouldn't take long. LBRS spam is really fast and you even have loot from there if you are lucky and get the ring.
---
Thanks, one of the reasons I left retail behind was that there were no groups running older content and I felt as though I really missed out on a ton.
---
Woooosh
---
The 8 hours per day people ran out of regular content weeks ago. I typically spend a couple of hours after work in WoW, but nowhere remotely close to 8+. Currently I miss very few pieces for my pre-raid BiS setup and am halfway done farming for my epic mount by running instances as a feral tank. So for me the timing is perfect. There is still other stuff to do, but Dire maul will both be a breath of fresh air and finally add some critical pieces of gear. There is currently no real tanking weapon but the BoE world drop for example.
---
Everyone I friended while leveling and everyone in my guild save for one person that spent several weeks on a vacation is level 60 by now and many already started playing alts.
---
This is obviously different for newer servers or people who joined in later. But overall this is not blizzard catering to a tiny minority. They probably looked at their numbers and came to the conclusion it was a good time to release Dire Maul, because a large number of players would benefit from more content.
---
This. It's ridiculous.
---
I am only 35 and I don't care (got a job you know, there are days when I can't even play 30 mins even..), there are a bunch of 60s on Gandling already raiding like crazy but I still find tons of similar level people like me basically everywhere I go. 
---
If you feel getting left behind makes you want to play less then I suggest you go and play Retail because it has tons of carebear catch up mechanics.
---
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO worst excuse ive heard. just play 2 hrs a day
---
It is actually better than Kang, the makes Cleaver do both more lowend and topend damage than Kang, the hit is also alright, the Kang proc proccs rarely in PvP
---
I used a 2hmace from lvl 20 up to 35, then decided to invest 2 gold for an upgrade from AH. Was a good thing. THe next weapon I could use was a greed that dropped in Uldaman. And I ran both RFK and Armory 10+ times for the axes. And here he is... getting 2 epics..
---
DM for *now*, I'm concerned about Naxxramas as I heard that Naxx has gear on par with starting equipment from TBC (making everything prior obsolete).
---
Everyone that says they have a hard time farming gold as a holy priest is probably sitting in a major city doing nothing or spending every bit of gold as they earn it.
---
Run loads of instances. I earned enough gold to buy my epic mount, truefaith, eye of shadow, +55 healing enchant, and many more things all by just running dungeons and vendoring tons of blues, Greys, and greens. I wasn't really aotc nor did I even win any big item over 10g.
---
I remember just surviving with 1hp while running away from multiple mobs, wish I'd been quick enough to get a screen shot in my panic
---
He’s just a reddit troll... no one is that delusional and still use words like ”get good”
---
Details addon, its on the twitch app.
---
Thank you, that solved it!
---
Another question. On panel 1 I want to always have the party im in, but I cant seem to get it to work. If I change it to Own party it just dissappears. Any idea why that is?
---
Not really concerned about it. The Hong Kong protesters have brutally beaten people for stating they're all Chinese. Don't really care about some dude getting booted for violating the terms in which he signed up to compete.
---
&gt; For more hardcore players, this is a godsend
---
Thing is; the hardcores are already farming ony/MC so isn't Dire Maul kinda irrelevant to them ?
---
RemindMe! 2 days
---
Kang is actually worse than Cleaver though, atleast for Warrior
---
If you dont feel like playing then dont? Ure not far behind the curve youre just too lazy to push through your levels and waste time finding dungeon groups instead of actually leveling up. The dungeons from 20-50 dont matter at all.  If youre playing mage get the aoe grind going, you will fly through the levels.
---
What level are you? It's easy early on, especially if you're an alt and have been kitting it out with gear bought with your main's gold. 
---
If you have someone help you with your WW axe at level 30, you'll be tearing through mobs left and right. Mobs just blow up to your crits, green mobs can sometimes even be like 4 shotted, it's great.
---
... Then you get to like level 50+, hands down one of the least fun gaming experience I've had is playing as a melee in Un'goro. 
---
30 min diseases that increase your damage taken by 54% (!), mobs like the Tar Lords who disarm you 2-3 times during the time it takes you to kill them, eating after pretty much every mob, etc etc.
---
Yes, it's **not hard**, but it's also **not fun**.
---
Why is it ass? Because the MT is the only one taking dmg in this fight? Is it because you dont need every raid member to bring an arcane pot ? If the fight is only 15 sec, why are they all dead? They didnt bring pots, hence stacking up would in 3 groups would have been the better option for THEM here. Ofc you can bring the arc pots, it's just a waste of maths and No pug will ever have them for this fight.
---
Once i cleared that whole area in felwood in the cave with the demons where felcloth drops, the whole thing, with an opposing faction member working as team.  
---
Yester a gang of allies rolled up on me, first i was promptly sapped, then i was mindcrontrolled. Then i was full buffed and they even gave me kings ROFL. Wont be forgetting that one anytime soon.
---
The extra "glint" in his eyes really sells it.
---
Wtf is your job that you can just take 6 weeks off? Most people can't take that much off in an entire year..
---
Thank you, I really don't want to miss out on places like BRD (I still remember that thread that extolled how awesome BRD is). I am certainly happy to know there'll always be demand for these places.
---
Exactly the reason I made weakauras that will show me when I have enough mana to cast the heals and still shift back into form :P glad i don't have to worry about that anymore.
---
so polite
---
Were you actually one of the undead I was spellcleaving with or do you mean generally?
---
players like him needs to be ganked for atleast half an hour.
---
Might delete later, idk
---
I'm not sure that's correct. According to the information i've found a mage can aoe farm there for ~50 gold/hour. This is just as good as farming ZF graves right now, so I can't see it making much difference.
---
/join LookingForGroup
---
I'm Skerum us east pvp. No issues filling any type of instance till super late at night.
---
Thank you, I'm most likely worrying over nothing. I really want to experience all these other dungeons and I'm certainly extremely grateful you still get full BRD runs (I'm still 26 and I desperately want to see it all).
---
I mean if it plays out like it did in original vanilla, or on many private servers, most players won't get much past AQ40, since it proved to be a real guild breaker back then.
---
Ther will of course be a point where it will get damn hard to find people for wailing caverns, deadmines or any other very low level dungeons, yes, but I don't think the higher level ones will die anytime soon.
---
Its a question if its a exploit to use macros from 8.x, but there is no discussion nor answer so I think there is no reason to be worried.
---
As of editing, thanks for the effort. Someone posted working version below just so you know :)
---
Well I just confirmed in main post that it exists ;)
---
So did your group wipe? If not the healer did his job. Renew is one of the most mana efficient heal spells a priest has. I rather like a guy only casting renews instead of pws'ing the tank :D
---
Yes, very smart, magnificent knowledge about economics. Is not like the mats to enchant the knife were worth 10g so the knife could not be sold for less at a loss
---
Some animations do look better on retail IMO (like Charge). But it's a nice to have, not a must.
---
Kind of jealous of people on the dole.
---
But at the same time I'm not.
---
same :( Not seen any boes worth more than 5g drop.
---
Grandma is more into thrillers rather than fantasy, I suppose. Sad.
---
Dont think BRD or UBRS will never go out of style, just because they are both in the onyxia quest line, you got HIGHLY sought after items in both.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=hunter+dire+maul+farm
---
DM gear will make no difference. MC/Onyxia are already trivial. We're talking easier than retail LFR.
---
I would rather it go TBC and then classic+ in an ideal world.
---
TBC made a lot of classes viable (ret pally, tank, shadow priest, druids) and balanced them into dungeons. It also expanded on professions, had world pvp areas and bosses with immersive dungeons and raids (kara).
---
The only down sides where resilience and mace rouges as even flying was only available in tbc areas and only really used in certain areas until people got epic flyers.
---
If they were to do tbc and then from there, expand in those ideas into classic+ instead of WoTLK I think it would be better, as WoTLK seems to go down the path of retail, to BFA and to be honest, I have no interest in any of the current content or no motivation to try BFA as with previous expansions I usually tap out after 2 days since it is to much like a theme park now.
---
-cheers
---
You can easily have 150 spell damage by 45.
---
&gt; What I am going to say is, playing a warrior is not hard.
---
No class is hard to level, some of them sure are tedious as hell though.
---
I don't know much about AQ40 loot, but I was concerned with the release of places like Naxxramas that people would probably end up preferring to just forgo many places in favor of gearing up from places like Naxx (as I'd heard the gear there far outclasses everything prior).
---
I am using separate addon for totems entirely but thanks for the info :)
---
Read previous response. But I understand that it's difficult to grasp how certain reactions might be interpret by other human beings.
---
Buy the pants he lists for 12s relist for 40s, profit?
---
I picked up the lvl 47 Stoneraven polearm from AH. Great stats, and like axes it gives an additional 5% crit through arms talents. It does require a respec though.
---
Ahh I thought bgs were coming in phase 2. Ty
---
Did an elite quest in Arathi last night.
---
Was me: a paladin, a nelf warrior, a tauren warrior and a troll shaman.
---
We alternated tapping the mobs then assisting each other's group until everyone /cheer and /yes then we stuck together until we got back out of Stromgarde at which point everyone /bye and /ty and went their separate ways.
---
*sniff*
---
*wipes away a solitary tear*
---
Such a beautiful thing.
---
But it's red and now its dead
---
RNG gods bless you my man!
---
You can see BNet friends level, class and location only if you're on the same server. What if you're in same server, different faction?
---
The best deepfried munching you can have is Gnome.
---
it only seems to show on some people, is it a new thing?
---
1.5 months after launch, and this is essentially phase 1.5. At this pace it's a phase every 3 months.
---
with 5 phases, and assuming an average of 3 months per phase, that's 15 months from the start until phase 6 gets released. Way too fast? I don't think so. Getting to Phase 6 in 15 months from the start of classic(December 2020) isn't all that fast by any stretch of imagination.
---
Nah the majority of the pulls we were sitting at 20% hp with them just standing there, they'd cast one renew on the tank maybe every other pull, then mc a mob lol.
---
This
---
Upvoted for 2 copper.
---
Hey that looks like my bank bag!
---
32 on Gandling here 🤘🏻
---
We didn't waited 15 years to discover that paladin were the best aoe tank of classic tho.
---
I don’t get it. Someone explain please.
---
That is only in your zone right? 
---
Currently qsting in Duskwood and really want to get a Stockade group going since I have 5 qsts there haha.
---
Funny,, you only got there by being in a fucking group and having the group fucking kill it for you.
---
Considering you can only get it in a raid.. you're not fucking special since you cannot do it on your own asshole
---
Ooo can I be the green one with the clover on my belly
---
After you switch weapon there is GCD so usually if you want to interrupt you need to switch right at the start of casting
---
What is HmS?
---
Would think if that was the case the other character in group of theirs would leave, still had all but that one person in group wanting to do more but obviously with a non afk healer lol.
---
There is more better games for u. This is old game for those who remember .. with all issues it had in that time .. if u do not like dungeons and doing stuff over and over again .. then this game is not for u .. as u see after 15 years only thing which Blizz provided to players is to start over again .. this game deserve Wow2 .. 
---
Im playing this trash only becouse of all my friends are playing it .. so Im enyoing playing with them .. doing group stuff .. its sad that they do not want to play any New game instead of this ..
---
The only thing I KoS is undead Rogues. Because you have to hit them first unless you want to get ganked.
---
Otherwise in with you. Can’t bring myself to just jump on a person who’s minding their own business.
---
yeah that sounds like blizzard alright
---
Of course, but you cant' steamroll Naxx anymore like you can MC - with 20 somewhat competent people carrying the weight of ~20 others who are just happy to play and don't give much about meta, min/maxing or anything even close to that. You need 40 people with already good gear which do know what to do.
---
That moment when you are happily grinding your mobs one at a time and you get respawned on by a couple. Damn pirates. Hamstring fear and ruuuuuuun!
---
Its too bad t0 isnt selling for all that much. At least on my server anyway. Better than nothing.
---
You are actually on to something.
---
So with 305 weapon skill the chance to miss is 6% on a boss, and the hitcap is 6%, easy.
---
However with 300 weaponskill it changes. The miss chance is 8% but the hit is 9%, that's because there's some wonky vanilla code in there that states if the weaponskill to dfefense level(5\*mob lvl) is over 10, then the first 1% from your gear/talents is ignored.
---
And sweet ogre booty
---
ok but who cares? this has nothing to do with classic
---
Pretty sure there is a way to do it but sadly I can't help you :(
---
aren’t epic world drops supposed to be 1 in 1000 or something?
---
I just saw a hunter solo DM north tribute in 9 minutes with what seems to be shitty gear.
---
He got 3 blues and 2 greens + 4 Major mana pots (these are like 2g per).
---
The blues he got had shitty vendor price, but about 10g vendoring the 3 blues and greens, 8 g for the major mana pots.
---
9 minutes.
---
There's a huge market for cooking mats, I'll tell you that!
---
I was surprised to sell 10 stringy wolf meats for 20 silver. That stuff drops from the large number of mobs of them like crazy. I'm tempted to actually make bank selling cooking mats like this. I can raise my own cooking (plus fishing) via just cooking fish.
---
Arms is good if you have enough gear or good enough healers to tank with a 2 hander, you have enough rage for everything. 
---
Otherwise 2H fury is a good starting point, you dont need as much hit to make it work decently. When you get 9% hit you can go dual wield fury.
---
He didn't attack OP, and just let him gather the Lotus. From my point of view it seems like the orc was very honorable.
---
speciest... ?
---
Or alternatively, hostile enemy faction players.
---
Time to call it quits then.
---
Nice picture. Husband &amp; wife on a wyvern.
---
This is why people should be happy about DM coming out. It makes prebis gearing so so much easier. So if you are not 60 or prebis yet, you are gonna have an easier time getting ready to join raids, isn't that a good thing?!
---
me, the dwarf warrior:
---
\- pops stoneform  
---
\- laughs at tar lurker  
---
\- watches in agony as dwarf unleashes another miss/parry chain  
---
\- tar lurker reapplies disease after stoneform runs out  
---
\- cries silently for the next 120 seconds
---
Any 1 had this printed yet? What size wld work so you could still read all the print?
---
......I vendored mine cause I didn't think people actually bought the damn thing &gt;.&gt;
---
i personally feel like warlocks actually have the biggest amount of noobs playing them in classic. it’s amazing how 75% of them throw dots on everything in dungeon only to pull aggro off the tank and kite the mob AWAY from the tank and them blast them for not being able to keep threat over “only a few measly dots”. that or aggroing pats with their imp.
---
You are though, whether you are in the majority or not, miles behind the cutting edge. That is the result of arguably too little timegating, allowing hardcore players to be so insurmountably ahead of casuals that they cannot compete for anything, possibly ever again. You're not even playing the same game at this point. You're watching the game being played over the shoulders of others, not in anticipation but with the expectation that you won't be seeing this manifestation of gameplay at all. But that shouldn't be to anyone's surprise, that's what vanilla gameplay is all about, catering to those with no responsibilities and unlimited time to give them a sense of fulfillment in a different world.
---
i mean to be fair if people want this to be as vanilla like as possible then shouldn't content releases be the same? these people that are rushing to 60 and are now bored did it to themselves. i don't think there were many people rushing to 60 during vanilla. not saying that they should be forced to limit themselves but from what i understand blizzard was wanting to do classic with a similar release schedule of actual vanilla or a scaled down version of it. treat it like you would a brand new mmo it's not going to have a shit ton of content at max level on release let alone a month or so after
---
Yeah, but to be half decent they have to farm shitton of pummelers lol :D
---
......Walked into what?
---
And then if the bids aren't good enough you can just cancel the auction.
---
It's not necessarily this specific case that should concern you it's the amount of power china is able and willing to throw around.  China's censorship is leaking into the rest of the world because they're financially harming anyone who doesn't self censor to appeal to them.   It's very concerning.
---
I'm doing rested xp since lvl 12...
---
Classic is out a month and youre concerned about Naxx gear? Why is that?
---
OP wrote " a level 60 orc rides over to me and begins spitting on me and /rude."
---
That Orc player needs to be ganked by the opposing faction.
---
It's a pvp server, people pvp. It is that simple.
---
I personally rolled a normal server this time around but if I were on a pvp server then I would full expect to get ganked because I was on a pvp server.
---
To be fair, ganking in starter zones (e.g westfall) is kind of a d*** move but at the same time that is why the local defense chat channel exists or simply all chat exists.
---
There is no motive outside the fact that it is a pvp server.
---
My first hk back in the day was killing a ganking lvl 60 in a level in a lvl 30ish zone (the one with stiches) utilizing town guards.
---
You adapt or die. Simple.
---
You don't need to max rank regrowth, and you aren't using that mana for anything else anyway. Just drink every 4-5 pulls when the casters are doing it anyway, and you'll be set.
---
And?? I’m still gonna play classic
---
le narwhal bacons at midnight my gentleman and a scholar
---
Alright, we'll sleep for now. Let me know if you want to pick this up in the morning.
---
Well, originally DM came out about 1 month after Rag kill if I'm not mistaken. So the pace is just OK and DM items don't change the game that much, it will only change the economy.           
---
Don't compare it to the old times. Now, because of the streams, etc., you just get this inner feeling that you gotta keep up somehow. Just enjoy the game, there will be a lot of people who don't rush things and will finish leveling soonish and who will want to run those dungs for quests..         
---
**It was not designed for everyone to participate in "progress", and not everyone should get kills of bosses or getting their BiS before next content is launched..**     
---
You either kept up with endgame or didn't give a f and killed it when you got there later.. Honestly, when I played Vanilla originally, I didn't even raid, didn't hunt for any BiS, just had fun around and that was my vanilla experience.    
---
It could be the inner nerd in you, that wants to progress like 14-15 years ago, but lets be real. We are not in the same situations as we were 15 years ago right?
---
Just.... Why
---
If you care about human rights and democracy even a little, please support Hong Kong with your wallet by canceling your WoW subscription.
---
I love classic, but I'm gladly cancelling my subscription to show Blizzard that human rights come before profits.
---
ElvUI
---
they are being pressured by all the people that raced to 60 and this is now the results. people need to start speaking up more about wanting them to slow down because the vocal minority will just keep getting louder
---
I understand this isn't directly related to Classic WoW, but this behavior should definitely be of serious concern for anyone giving them money through their subscription.
---
They have basically decided to declare, unequivocally, that they as a company care more about their bottom line than the human lives and dignity currently being assaulted in Hong Kong.
---
I'm cancelling my subscription, and that hurts because this was the first game in a long time to really get me excited for its release. But I can't keep giving Activision/Blizzard money after they blatantly censored their casters for allowing (not asking, not pushing) Blitzchung to repeat the slogan of the Hong Kong protestors: Restore Hong Kong, revolution of our lives.
---
My birthday :)
---
True. However leveling times haven't really changed, dungeons still take roughly the same time and raid lockouts are the same and for many people, the available time to play these days is less than 15 years ago.
---
Same company and stuff. But literally the same post was removed for rule 1 and 5 a few minutes ago.
---
Agree. You want the skin? Become a skinner. I don't see people rolling for Archmage Robes etc on trade chat. Rolling with the other skinners however I consider as fair and good.
---
/sarcasm
---
People will need argent dawn rep for naxx, so strat/scholo will stay relevant for a long time
---
SPOTS! SPOTS! SPOTS!
---
Dreadforge retaliator from emperor is the best alternative
---
Who are you calling a girl here, boy?
---
Many people are very close to pre-raid BiS. If I was only after items all I could do was running the same instance repeatedly, which gets old rather quickly.
---
And to be honest Phase 2 doesn't add all that much for me. PvP without battlefields will be fun for a night or two at best. I'm not in a guild that has a real chance of snatching world bosses. Dire Maul is really cool, but not "I'll gladly wait 4 months for it and then another 4 until the next stuff"-cool. I'd also rather experience Dire Maul in pre-raid gear, than stomping it in Tier Sets.
---
So the next real content patch will be Phase 3 with battlegrounds and BWL. The faster Phase 2 starts, the faster we are getting to that one. Personally I mostly wait for the 20mans, but I understand they can't rush everything. But adding a couple world bosses and an instance to the game after most people that simply played regularly since the start are 60 isn't exactly rushing.
---
"my social life" aka his girlfriend didn't like him in the first place and started making retarded demands.
---
Those Horde players clearly have honor lol.
---
Not really for tanking, you naturally generate way more threat than a war in P1 while not really losing that much on mitigation given how powerful your pre-raid BIS already are, the pummelers are just the icing on the cake.
---
This has nothing to do with Classic WoW. Please post it in an appropriate subreddit.
---
It's a bit better, yeah.
---
Curse of tongues lets you speak demonic, maybe it translates as well?
---
You mean the right way
---
Fuck the horde.  I don’t care if this one was nice.
---
The trick as warrior and rogue leveling is to make the GREEN quests. You won't miss and you won't die if there are two mobs. GL
---
I love it when players give heads up on what's next in a dungeon. Especially if it's new or I haven't played it in over a decade.
---
What class are you?  Almost everyone has a farm they can do in DM, as warrior+healer you can do jump runs, rogue has other ways of farming gold, everyone else has been covered pretty much.
---
It's good they are fortunately 33 levels higher than 22 then.
---
No..
---
this clears things up ty
---
amen. boycotting big companies never work unless you're gonna get EA level backlash. No one cares about some casters and a guy losing his prize money for breaking a clearly written rule.
---
Changing the game so a braindead zombie can get rewards is not the same as changing the schedule.
---
Nope, I'll wait for Pikachu to be a playable race
---
The second is something people overlook a lot, I think. Who cares about +2 stamina or spirit on your belt when you could sell that weapon you can't even use for 5g?
---
Haha right!? Can't run in a marathon? Just run further! Depressed? Just laugh! Feeling lonely? Just don't! Sheesh, idiots.
---
Because anyone with a sliver of humanity left should cancel any subscription with blizzard. They've proven where their values are. 
---
Stop playing WoW
---
How do you do this? I spend the entire fight stunned if I bubble I just get stunned again after
---
but they get outscaled very fast once further content drops. DW warriors tpm scales incredibly well with gear.
---
If this is true I never knew this
---
There are items that allow chests to be unlocked. If I wanted to I could carry those items. I've got no problem with the rogue keeping it if they want.
---
To bypass the fizzle, you just made a macro to spam the trinket because the cooldown would trigger on successful use iirc.
---
What’s truly great is that all horde are generally terrible fighters when they are alone and only fight when they are in groups of three.
---
i like to say "LFG Hearthstone Rogue Legendary Card dungeon"
---
Anything I shouldn't miss as I approach 40?
---
Currently juggling SM runs and late night STV leveling to grind me over the hump, I just dinged 39.
---
This man camps rares.
---
Trauma from having missed out on a vast number of instances during retail. I'm not fast at leveling (I can't even ensure I get 1 level a day) and time moves fast, my fears may be overblown but I was concerned that I'd hit 60 and not find groups for older content, or worse, be expected not to bother with them because there are leagues more optimal ways of powering up my character. When vanilla was originally out, I didn't have the time to devote to guilds or dungeons, and when I DID have the time to devote to a guild or dungeon, Cata had been released for a few months already.
---
If they wanna roll it, and if you don't like the people in the group (my friend opens boxes for us, but I also give him free enchants if I have mats, because we all just work together), "my lock picking isn't high enough, sorry." Open after the dungeon, GG.
---
Dotlocks also love them as well.
---
Warlock class mount when DM is released next week
---
^^
---
Now you know how The King died.
---
you are right. 300 skinning+knife roll only. 
---
nevertheless, in all cases people will call you ninja anyway
---
Nost also overtuned mob health and damage as far as I know.  In my opinion, it would've been a lot more fun if Blizzard had overtuned things to compensate for how overpowered 1.12 is compared to 1.1 in terms of talents and gear.  But with all of the /#nochanges going around the only consensus that would appease the majority is what we have now, and it's a *million* times better than playing retail or corrupt private servers (in my opinion).
---
AH economics is easier to understand than you think. People buy according to what it's worth to them, or less. That's it. If someone buys out all the essence of air for 10g each, then resells it all for 15g each, clearly it was still worth buying to players rather than farming it. Who knows, maybe some people will take advantage of this and start saving their essence of air for a certain patch. Hint hint.
---
imagine thinking that is going to happen often for it to matter or at all. i played on a pvp server back in the day with my warlock and that never happened to me once and i only ever used my class mount
---
Yeah... Just make 200each when you log in.. you can also sell em, same a portals hehe...
---
Is this strat viable for a paladin lvl 29 ?
---
It’s fucking Juggs!
---
I still remember the first post you made that showed all your warriors and r/WoW was completely confused as to why you had so many. 
---
You just kind of brushed off all the people questioning it with funny “I just like warrior, man” until you gave a real answer as to why, it always stuck with me. I was curious if you were gonna end up in Classic as well. 
---
Best of luck on the journey friend. :)
---
As someone who just finished a 5 day aka 80h marathon I understand why you do this. I can’t. Logging in right now again.
---
Five seconds, which matters more when you're grinding, or PvPing, or doing anything where your main resource matters to you in the short term. It's obviously not a factor when you're mounting up from a quest hand-in to vendor all the useless shit you apparently can't stop carrying.
---
Man ignore these assholes on here who give you advice and then casually insult you at the same time. Classic is hugely popular and word of mouth is still strong. I think there will be plenty of people still trudging their way to 60 for a long time, and others with their alts. As long as you're having fun there will be plenty of time to gear up and raid whenever you do hit 60.
---
Awesome ty :)
---
They just can't seem to understand...hostility through ignorance at its finest.
---
Loving classic but would be difficult to continue paying a sub after this - near enough £100 a year as well as hours of my time to essentially supporting this kind of attitude isn’t something I’m comfortable with
---
but it's greyed out for any settings in Performance tweaks
---
Warcraft 3 introduced Night Elves, Blood Elves, Naga, Dreanei (creepy version), Scourge and the majority of "creep" races - additions that greatly strengthened and improved WoW.
---
I think WoW's made some great additions to the canon - Scarlet Crusade are great, I think all the new zones look wonderful and Horde benefitted greatly from new storylines. I don't think there should be a purity test - "if it's not in Warcraft 1 it ain't Warcraft" would lead to a very small world.
---
Naxx is a Raid, so no dungeon.  
---
Yes Tier3 is  absolutly insane,  
---
But please dont worry about Naxx after just 1 month... that ridiculous...  
---
Also havign Tier3 Gear is insane hard work.
---
We'll be getting the version with less NPCs, which was something that a lot of people pushed back against when Blizzard revealed the info.
---
I think AV's are going to be rushfests, mostly skipping over the other faction and just finishing the game within 30 mins everytime.
---
Great for honor and reputation, but bad for the overall longevity of the BG. I guess we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out.
---
the top end of the curve was at 60 in a couple of weeks, I started with them on release day, now I'm only 42. Don't worry about it, the whole point of this one is to not be too bothered by the curve, the whole point of the game was actually playing it, and less about max level. Iwatch people in my friends list overtake me constantly, I don't care, as I got my kicks from helping the lower guys quest an area that was full of alliance or such.
---
Ive had the Leaf for 2 weeks, completed the demon heads quest got the quiver.  Sadly, still havent seen a Sinew drop from Ony yet.....
---
9 out 10 groups will have a rogue or someone else with the scholo key. So it's up to you if think it's worth getting for the 10% of a time you won't have a key.
---
Supporting Hong Kong.  China has some very strong views on some topics and if you're in bed with them, or want to be, you have to protect those views at all costs.
---
The raids have a lock out so what are you doing the other days
---
Also miners (who are not rogues) require a group to get to most dark iron nodes/craft high end bs recipies does that means everyone gets to roll on lionheart helm if I am making it because the group was required to get me to the forge?
---
I'm a lock. Those locks are stupid. They also break my succubus seduce so I also hate them. Stupid locks.
---
You did well. Just roll with people who are able to skin it.
---
more like the private server players that think they know better than people that actually played this game back then
---
+2% hit vs the 300-soemthing armor difference between plate and leather is a no brainer.
---
I've dealt with anger management issues myself. If you need help or just someone to talk to, I'm here for you.
---
Please repost this for the 10th time.
---
Something like that, although a Warrior tank has a lot of non-damaging threat builders, like Revenge, which hits like a limp noodle, and Sunder Armor, which does no damage. 
---
If you don't have a threat meter, then I'd say no more than 2-2.5 times the tank's dps isn't a terrible way to judge it.
---
Imagine playing wow because you think it's a fair competitive game.  Inequality is a feature of mmos.
---
I learned this recently as well but I've gotten so used to facing towards the innkeeper by now that I refuse to make use of it. It just feels wrong using hearthstone and then facing the away from the innkeeper :)
---
The problem was we were all Alliance so there was no way to retaliate. I would have no issue if it was an opposite faction member.
---
Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying
---
How often do you grp with BS lock pickers for this to even be a question.
---
60 mph is a "fast" lane? haha
---
Cool, thanks for clarifying!
---
Sounds unoriginal.
---
Hmm, not at pc so can’t check - if you don’t find a solution by this evening feel free to pm me and i will check it out for you when im in game
---
BIS until Chrommagus in BWL.
---
As a lock, I have plenty of bandages and I find them more efficient than eating
---
that's exactly what it is. people who played on a private server and never actually played these classes back then
---
don´t speak about the dance club.... we will eventually find you.
---
As a tank, what are some abilities from dps that generate threat that I can look out for and call out?
---
It was presumed to be releasing with Phase 2. 
---
I don't get the levelling argument. Most farm runs for BRD are with a full group of 60s anyway, and Dire Maul can still be ran by sub-60 players. 
---
This genuinely doesn't affect people stuck in the 30's because they likely would not have been 60 by the time Dire Maul released anyway. 
---
In fact this release date is slower than the official EU release date of DM back in the day. 
---
BRD and other dungeons will still be relevant.
---
Pretty much me. Got the axe at 33, level 36 now, life have been good so far.
---
Aaaand now I cant select any other frame than panel 2 again.. teying tobpress it while innoptions but it just wont select it.
---
I'd love to spot two bears in the wild, slowly wresteling around who to gets this farm spot, where one leaves without being killed.
---
Dont you need 1% more hit to get 9% hit capped? 
---
Congrats nonetheless!
---
Questing is usually faster than doing dungeons unless you're in a tryhard aoe spam group.  Also gear doesn't matter while leveling. You are behind the curve so you might have to change your playstyle a bit if you want to be more efficient with your time.
---
You should try it when mobs can banish players, but us locks can't. I want their damn banish.
---
Shadow priest can solo very efficiently. I got mine to 58 mostly by questing solo, and when I compare kill times to other players, it's very similar with no down time for 3-5 monsters. Plus I can solo 3 mobs with no real threat, unless they have fear. Soloing elites is possible as well, depending on elite.
---
Most people won't, but it's a real pain in the ass for everyone who has reached that level.
---
This thread is about BAD locks. I totally know that a good lock can just constantly keep themselves sustained and won't need much (if any) help from the healer. However, we're talking about locks that tap till 10%, then complain when they're not topped off, or just plain die from the pulls (because if they're tapping to 10% they're obviously not watching their threat).
---
Can engineering items such as dynamite crit and if so, what affects the crit chance?
---
You forgot to mention that they like to life tap down to 20% health in the midst of all this because drinking or bandaging would be too much work
---
This is not the only downside. But even if it was. You know what is better than a downside that rarely happens? One that never happens. Playing on a pvp server is not really that relevant. This will happen mostly in BGs, especially now that are more knowledgable about it. When in on my rogue i know exactly what im gonna do to warlocks that i feel will probably leave their position. Wait in stealth and when they try to mount i'll kick and lock them out of shadow school. Free kill
---
I don't think this game is a good match for you. Perhaps retail may be more in line with your playstyle.
---
World PvP isnt amazing if It's the only way to farm honor. Flight paths will be camped and XP will be impossible.
---
I'm all for a hardcore game but this isnt hardcore this is bad design. Put one It's OK. We'll always have griefing players in Vanilla just dont force us to all go grief.
---
Lol, you can't select which target gets hit by whirlwind /s
---
Selling Blue Pearls in Badlands makes you filthy rich.
---
Mines in brd and the black forge require a group to get to as does high end alchemy does that mean anything I craft at the forge or alchemy lab people can roll on cause I needed them to get there......no because I did all the legwork all they did was a dungeon they would have done anyway and don't get the rewards of my prior legwork (in this example requiring finkles to skin it)
---
yeah rage is more of an issue in early dungeons where gear is scarce, and especially so without full talents
---
no it doesn't lmao, dhk's are only for npcs
---
Simple, remove Blink from your skillbar and you wont see its cd anymore. Its a dirty ass skill anyway.
---
I think the only thing that the Classic WoW community DOESN'T overexaggerate is how bad ret dps is. Mind you, ret dps can be okay if the person really knows what they are doing, but 99% of rets will do terrible dps.
---
You can buy items back from vendors, heh.
---
Imagine changing the topic so drastically that you look like you are drunk lol, I just told you that people are stomping low level and you say I think it's a fair game.
---
dont tell them the true they get hurt ^^
---
Not really. BWL just required coordination and 4-5 solid tanks.
---
Demoted you for poking fun? Toxic af?
---
You're going to get such an objective set of opinion asking this question on a classic wow sub.
---
Yes? But we're talking about getting fury at start of pull to gain threat. Zerker rage only works if you're getting beat on. I pop it on basically every pull, but if I don't make the pull it won't matter, because the mobs are beating everyone else.
---
I see a perfect pull. I don't see the neccessary mages to accompany said pull.
---
What are you even mad at?.. Europe had Diremaul pretty much at release and it didn't cause them to "zoom through classic".  I think you're just misinformed.
---
Completely agree.
---
I haven't heard anyone complain
---
There's gear in all raid insurances that's best in slot, not only Naxx.
---
Right now you probably still have a lot of players grinding pre-raid BiS in 5man dungeons. So there is a ton of groups. It won't be the same as players start only needing items from raids. But don't worry. There'll still be a lot of players joining Classic late and others leveling alts.
---
5mans won't stop.
---
Have you tried this recently? Only reason i ask is changing equipment in combat incurs GCD so this doesn’t work
---
FROST OIL
---
Too soon wtfff
---
No I'm telling you it's fair game.
---
Don't forget to take a break sometimes
---
There’s 0 reason to spec protection, I’m pretty sure I literally haven’t even run with one and I’ve done 30+ clears of strat.
---
Fury or Arms both tank dungeons easily at max level.
---
Please repost it again, like the guy _literally_ 2 posts before you.
---
Or no food at all.
---
M U L T I S H O T
---
Oh bother!
---
What's gonna happen then is that instead of the tank joining your group, he will create his own and reserve the loot he wants, and people will join him instantly while you're still searching for a tank for 2 hours that is willing to boost 4 people through a dungeon he doesn't need anything from.
---
&gt; Holy nerd shit jesus lmfao
---
Yeesh, this made me physically cringe.
---
Dont use details and ppl cant see your spec
---
Or, you know, just learn to read the pertinent answer you received.
---
this release is actually slower than it was in 2005 for eu players
---
You definitely can, and it functions as intended with the people that have already been using it
---
So you are asking me to imagine what you think....?
---
What time do patches usually release? Specifically for next week - since I live in Europe, will I be able to log on right after the maintenance on Wednesday morning and jump right into my warlock mount quest?
---
No. They where banned for voicing there political views, which if you read all the TOS’s is against the rules.  Can you link the other big streamers which have voiced there political views?
---
This is hearthstone..........
---
Why though? What's it matter? Do you really care that they got the last word in? I haven't met anyone like this, but if I did I'd just laugh, ignore them back and move on, it wouldn't bother me that I couldn't lash back at them. 
---
I see this sentiment a lot, just seems really weird to me - why would you want to spend even one minute of your time arguing with a moron, you won't convince him he's wrong.
---
It's about Blizzard censuring Hong Kong support for economic reason. Of course it has to do with Classic WoW since you're giving them your subscription money.
---
Now I'm not saying you're a monster if you don't unsubscribe or whatever but it's worth mentioning and at least not close your eyes.
---
Yeah post it again, that'll make people care, people love having this shit shoved down their throats
---
Wow first time I see such a spec. However, plenty of utilities + potential burst with omen. Interesting
---
One way or another you're contributing to this behavior. That's the nature of the economic system in which the world lives in.
---
No. If there is 1-2 mobs, don't use swipe. Use maul and tab between the targets. MUCH more rage and threat efficient.
---
There there are more than 4-5 mobs, swipe becomes inefficient for building threat because you only hit a fraction of them, Demo roar / precasting restoration and rejuv become valuable tools.
---
You are not too low to maul till youre oom aswell as ragestarved
---
56 Warrior here, tanked since classic, albeit on a druid.
---
I tanked Arms 10=&gt;40, gone deep prot 40=&gt; 50 and picked up fury prot 50 =&gt; 56, currently it looks like I will stay it.
---
So what can I say about tanking.
---
Furyprot:

Learn when to use shields and when to use 2 weapons. This will depend on your healer (I have the luxury to always have the same healer) and the enemies. Hotkey your shield and your offhand weapon so you can switch on a fly. Learn wich enemies have blockable attacks, and wich doesn't. Wich enemys care about your armor, and wich doesn't. Quick example: The flame elementals in brd won't care about your armor.
---
Now, for aoe thread (5+ Targets is where I get problems) while you won't be able to hold it, engineering makes it soooo much more easy. Just throw dynamite in the group and it will hold the first few aoe ticks from your dd's. If you have excess money you can also throw goblin sapper charges, wich will most likely hold aggro until the enemys are dead, but cost around 50 silver to make, so I only use those in emergencies.
---
T1 Dyamite: 1 Stones + 1/2 Runecloth =&gt; 12-15 silver / dynamite
---
T2 Dynamite: 1 Stone + 1/2 silk cloth =&gt; 3 silver / dynamite
---
Gobblin Sapper Charge: 6 Stones, 1 Mithril bar, 1 mage cloth =&gt; 40-50 silver / charge.
---
Other than that: Pull the mobs together. Tell your healer not to heal you until you have all the mobs you want, because your face aggro won't be enough to hold enemies off him, and if the heal gets aggro you are in big trouble- mobs will split up and it will be chaotic. Use piercing howl - it is such a great tool for tanking and kiting. Tell your dd's to wait till you stop before they start to aoe. If you have dynamite - Throw it to hold the enemies for 2-3 more seconds. Spam Demo shout if there are more enemies than allies. Spam Battle shout if there are more allies  (that you can ht) than enemies. 
---
Now, aoe started. Enemies are frozen, what to do? First check if a dd is near the enemies - of so DON'T MOVE AWAY - frozen enemies will attack the nearest dd. If not - move a bit to prevent damage - your heal will soon have to deal with your dd's getting damaged. Now, your job is to hold the enemies in the aoe as long as possible. If a enemy breaks the nova early and starts to run out, taunt it. Switch to the next enemie thats breatking out and try to pull aggro. If blizzard runs (wich it shoudn't, but not every mage is good) out use piercing howl to allow your allies to kite. Always wear a shield during aoe pulls.
---
1) Hotkey marks. ALWAYS mark skull / X. Start to aggro on X and let your dd's pull skull aggro. When skull starts moving, just taunt it back and care about X and the other enemies. Usually your taunt and any slow the dd's put on skull is enough to handle it, or  skull is a healer / caster that doesn't care wether it hits you or someone else. Learn what you need to tank and what not to tank
---
2) No stance dance sucks - but piercing howl makes up to it. If you are not sure you'll be able to hold all the aggro: Piercing howl. The slow will give you much needed time to react to loosing aggro, before a dd, or worse, the heal, bites the grass. Since you don't have stance dance - DON't charge enemies! You'll loose the rage regardless and if you thunderclap its not that much aggro / you will loose the rage from the first few hits you'd get in once you switch to defstance, and defstance rage is worth so much more! Exception: Go bersi stance to pop bersi rage and go back to def instandly - this will help your aggro generation. Other than that: Always be defstance. You are not the dd. (Even tho you'll easily top the meters once you switch to bersi stance if you have another tank)
---
3) Break LOS - if you have casters or ranges among the dd's, break los. Make sure that the healer also breaks los / tell your group where to stand. Nothing worse than having a freeroaming caster nuking your healer in the back because you can't charge it / no stance dance.
---
4) CC is your friend: While it is possible to do dungeons without cc, cc makes it more easy. Yes, you can hold aggro on 6 mobs, but do you really want to?
---
5) Don'T heroic strike / cleave unless you have lots of excess rage! Plan ahead for your next few strikes
---
6) If the healer is full but the dd's are drinking feel free to pull. Tell the dd's to keep drinking in such an event and use the time to gain aggro, so they can  go all out once they drank up.
---
7) If you want to break los but a caster gains aggro from a ranged mob (due to rebuffing or healing or whatever) use your battleshout to gain the aggro back. Battleshout is great for aggrogain from out of reach mobs
---
8) if you have a hunter and he places a freezing trap: Always shoot / pull the mob that you want to have in the trap. He will start to walk early and be the first to arrive.
---
9) If you have engineering try to get hold of force reactive disk. Seems to be great for aoe tanking and it is my current goal in classic to get hold of it.
---
10) Druids / Warlocks are your friends. Thorns and flame shield will be 5-20% of your total damage dealt, depending on the dungeon
---
Final thought: Tanking as full prot was easier and more dynamic, since you had access to stance dance and stuns / shield slam is 20 rage vs bloodrage 30 rage.
---
Furyprot offers the advantage of higher aggro generation if you have the gear for it
---
so, do i understand this right? people broke the rules and got punished for that?
---
where is the problem?
---
Thanks mate
---
I also cannot figure out what this means or is about. Perhaps the OP could please explain or provide context?
---
Haha I knew people like you exist. 
---
I gave my broker bank a nice name instead of mostgoldeu.
---
wowhead has a nice Engineering guide, all recipies are listed there. Can't link you, since it's blocked at work
---
Although I don't support the decision, I think Blizzard has a policy about political statements and association with their products. As all multi billion companies they prefer not to get involved in it for a fear of revenue loss.
---
I know, I'm disc which can solo fine too although not like shadow. I know a lot of people level as shadow and then switch, just not my style.
---
dont play on a dead server. 
---
On faerlina, there is people at all level curves
---
MLG confirmed
---
118 people agreed with that OP? Maybe those guys should be out leveling instead of crying on forums.
---
You misunderstand, I think.
---
Selling items to other players in the Maraudon farm is where you carry a player through the instance and they pay when they get the drop they want. The AH is not involved.
---
 They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
---
You can’t ask a question like that and not tell us what you did, spill the beans!
---
DM was out pretty out the moment the game launched here. Also what "nonDM" Meta, it's not like the gameplay will fundamentally change.
---
let's see if your post stays up xD
---
While I agree that people grinding insanely for the azerite traits.
---
The fact that those traits where locked behind those insane grinding gates in the first place is the problem.
---
Because. By the time you had azerite level 28 to unlock that final slot on your shoulders, you had already replaced them with another piece that now requires level30, and then rinse and repeat. This is why people did these grinds.
---
The azerite system is insanely flawed and broken, and as many pointed out back then, the unlocks should have been on the necklace itself, something that was never replaced, just like weapon artifacts were in Legion. Which they did add eventually, but the azerite system still remains, so that issue is still there.
---
I can't stand Desolace. I feel like it's very aptly named, there's just nothing going on.
---
 so, do i understand this right? people broke the rules and got punished for that?
---
my expierence is that the best way to find a zone that fits your level is installing the addon Questie and take a look at the quests all over world. Hover over them and look what level they need. If there are many quest in one area that fit your level -&gt; go there.
---
There are locks that manage their mana and health well, and there are those that nuke a group, and while the healer is sitting down lifetap to 1% and then stand there staring at you waiting for the healer to top them off because there is aoe incoming at the next pull.
---
They fired both of the casters present to make a point, could have just banned the player. They did take a stance and its with China.
---
I'm not for sure - but this may be because a lot of People bother a lot less for dungeons while being low Level. 
---
You are so fast at leveling that you outlevel most gear within a couple of hours. So it is just a time sink - which is OK IMO - but a lot of People just want to Level as fast as possible and therefor don't do dungeons :/
---
Later with 48-60 you can actually start farming pre-raid-bis which is way a lot of People start doing dungeons at that stage. You may percieve it as if there is much more Players at 50-60 but believe me. You may be slightly behing the curve - but not by a lot :)
---
People that are behind also don't Play as much usually. So you may see less of them than there actually are.
---
Don't feel discuuraged m8 - you are perfectly fine!!
---
Stop being a hypocrite. If you really care so much then you have to stop using the products of other companies who do business with China, which is basically all of them. I am not going to stop playing Classic over this, and I very much doubt a significant number of people will. 
---
If this entire subreddit quit playing any Blizzard games immediately, it would be nothing compared to what China could do should they decide to remove Blizzard over supporting the protesters.
---
Only if the warr is using a shield
---
You humble genius, you.
---
I highly recommend reading the following guide as there's a lot to a hunter, especially pets, that are never really explained in the game itself. 
---

**#NOCHANGES**
---
Grats! Same. It was somewhat hard and that made it rewarding. Since layers ended for us, prices on AH are up and things are selling fast, so it's getting easier somewhat.
---
I use these. Works fine for me. I do not have the whirlwind axe though. That was just thair because it makes it nice and generic. I have used macros that go straight from a 2h to a shield only. It's been fine. Currently mine are set up with duel wield and then it just changes off hand. I use 
---
/equipslot 17 shield - in macro 1 
---
/equipslot 17 offhand - in macro 2.   And a number of other macros.
---
Way too soon. I was looking forward to hitting 60 and gathering "Phase 1 items". Now most of that will just be DM...
---
This somehow resonates. I was questing in the Badlands on my priest, when I was asked out of nowhere, if I wanted to heal for an armory rush (of all things). No, thanks.
---
Tricky one.
---
Should any company that does business in China be boycotted so the government isn't rewarded for what's going on in Hong Kong? I've got no doubt in my mind that Blizzard doesn't support what's going on, but does excluding the entity of the Chinese population meaningfully do anything? Companies often argue that exposing China to Western and global values does more good then harm, even if they have to compromise.
---
Tricky.
---
Should any company that does business with the United States be boycotted so the government isn't rewarded for what's going on with the Kurds? I've got no doubt in my mind that Blizzard doesn't support Trump's actions there. Does excluding US citizens meaningfully do anything to stop it though? Will NA servers going down stop shells from hitting targets? 
---
Should any company that does business with the EU be boycotted so the government's that benefitted from centuries of colonialism aren't rewarded? Will closing the EU servers actually ensure reperations are paid? That the EU can no longer have bad policies?
---
Tricky. Very tricky. I do appreciate that every one of us has a different threshold of foreign policy they're willing to put up with - let's hope our own judgements are able to guide us through.
---
If you don't like intensity and prefer strategic play, you should play a hunter. Weaving is the easiest if you don't care about minmaxing. Just throw a spell after you fire a shot.
---
I hate that.
---
I tried the same, but I was stuck with, what? 6-7 dailies that gave like 75 rep each?
---
Yea.... Fuck off blizzard.
---
Have bag mods to make all bags one and just have had on a bar slot
---
Blizzard only make these decisions because they know that way too many gamers are addicted to their games to cancel sub
---
Do I agree with what blizzard did? No. Am I gonna cancel sub? No.
---
The Hong Kong protesters are brutally beating people who say that they're all Chinese people, they're attacking literally anyone that doesn't share the same opinion about how to deal with the situation. The original bill that sparked the protests has already been withdrawn, yet they're still out brutalizing people. No one is any more of a monster for not supporting the Hong Kong protests as they are for supporting literally any company because EVERY company does shit like this. Whether its Coca Cola funding right wing death squads in Colombia to kill striking workers, or Nike factories with no safety protocols killing and maiming workers who work on slave wages, or european and American diamond companies using child labor in Africa that robs people of their own wealth. Unless you're equally appalled by the economic system that maintains hegemony over the world don't preach to me about how someone is a monster for not caring about this as if it's some big revelation.
---
I don't think it lets you understand Demonic just speak it
---
If that works for you fine. Just dont be surprised if you join a premade BG group and they ask you to change your mount. Many groups will require you to have carrot om a stick which is only 3% more mount speed. Imagine killing someone with an instant spell and having to wait for the gcd to be able to use the mount. That is a much bigger timeloss than not having the carrot on a stick
---
Yesterday night I had no sleep at all playing wow and almost collapsed on my job during the day. Came home and put alarm on 4 a.m. to play couple of hours before the job
---
People are still gonna be raiding MC ony and all the beginning 60 content long after the next content phases come out. It's not like people just drop them. Don't worry you'll get your chance. The vast majority of people aren't level 60 right now. The content isn't going anywhere but by quitting, you ensure yourself you'll never see it. That said, you still shouldn't force yourself to play if you don't enjoy the game.
---
That said, not to be a dick but isaw you making a snarky comment about having to work and sleep. Not for nothing but I work a full time job and still managed to get to 54 yesterday since release, while juggling my social life in there as well. Perhaps try using an efficiency guide if you're really interested in getting the most out of your little time to play each day.
---
luckily i dont hoj
---
I made around that farming the demons in azshara from around 51-53 as a warlock. I would think a priest could come close to that.
---
but wouldn't you agree that Blizzard took a stance by their reaction in this issue?
---
first they deleted the VOD which is fine imo and goes well with your argument.
---
A punishment this harsh towards the player AND the casters shows that Blizzard did take a stance. You could argue that they were forced to in the first place but if their main argument was truly in a similar line to yours there was no need for this kind of punishment. You understand what I mean?
---
Blizzard would rather make money appealing to governments who commit genocide and torture people than allow a person their own thoughts.
---
Who cares, sounds like you didn’t even wipe, if you don’t want to play with him again put him on ignore and move on
---
Really wonder how many people have cancelled sub over this. My bet is a big fat 0, especially in this thread.
---
Don’t forget you could combine this with shatter as well ... oh boi
---
As guys in the original thread said - this is as bad as when LAN wasn't included in Star Craft 2, so maybe that's the better moral test?
---
Max level players have better places to be than sitting in the market square, that's what bank alts are for.
---
I downloaded it. Where is the setting. Don’t see it
---
No, I checked the whole place very thoroughly and definitely recall that one not being an inn
---
i work 5pm-2am so i usually play 3am-7am. nice for questing but theres noone to group with for dungeons and im usually asleep or doing adult stuff during mid day and working during peak hours :(((
---
We got 2 sulfuras and one bind, we're blessed
---
The secret is to use heroic strike only when its optimal, just like the guide you linked says...
---
i said 2+ not 1-2. for 2/3/4/5 you want to prio swipe if rage is an issue. for more, yes, prio demo, hots and then swipe
---
&gt; Anyone at 60 has been playing this game at basically 'full time job' or more levels since launch. This is a good point!
---
I work a full time job and have been 60 for 2 weeks.
---
How they managed to gets zf group with no mages is the real surprise. They're a dime a dozen.
---
Yes, I believe that's my best bet right now. Thanks for your suggestions.
---
I don't care if gnomeregan doesn't count, it is the most disgusting place in the WoW world! Otherwise I agree with you. :)
---
Post you linked to was deleted op
---
That would've been so fricking stale. MC/Ony is already on farm and most people at 60 are already decked out in most preraid BiS.
---
Even as a biased mage who wants his dank water, I think this is a strange decision.
---
If they just wanted to bring phase 2 forward, I don't understand why they wouldn't do that. And did they specify a reason for this? Because if this is based on complaints from hardcore players that have already rolled the content, Dire Maul is going to leave them even more bored because all it is going to achieve is to make the raids they are already doing easier. It's not like Dire Maul is difficult content.
---
I have no fear. My unborn kids shall play classic too. We need end game and I think I might just create an infinite amount. Everybody will when once my editors get easy enough to use.
---
For now im looking to get this into a state where others can help.
---
You posted this twice
---
Let them die a few times or you're just passing this behaviour on to the next group.
---
Yeah I played the priest Chapito! Good runs! 😁
---
Title says yojambo
---
So dont do the 5man?
---
You have to press the macro twice.
---
No me neither, but I have gotten salty comments after duels :p
---
Removing layering is more important for me than whatever dungeon gets released. There will be always people ahead and behind the curve. They can't please everyone.
---
Wait, both those servers are pvp, and both those are Horde. Am I missing something here?
---
Really? I know I've tried to heal the other faction, and you can't do that. I just assumed you couldn't buff them either.
---
Mages cursed then selves with SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE
---
A lot of entitlement going on in this thread...
---
Oh my apologies. I thought that was the guild name or such.
---
Really dude you think it takes anywhere near 5 months on 1.1?
---
It's a sad reality but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. If we just all gave up and took that stance then nothing would ever change
---
I don't think you can do that in one macro. Pretty sure you need one macro to do number 1 and a second macro to do number 2.
---
Only for ZF, Mara, SM and partially BRD on my server, not for the 60 dungeons.
---
Dire maul is mostly 60, and high 50 content
---
Mages can farm strat in pulls of 76 mobs
---
Shit happens honestly
---
consider that WLs are one of the few top dd classes with no meaningful way to reduce aggro, so mistakes with that class are a lot more consequential. Maybe not the most noobish class, just the most easily misused one?
---
Guilds exist for the players, of course they should be thinking about what they can get out of themm are you daft?
---
You should've rolled an off timezone server honestly. Ping might be a little weird but you'll get people to play with. Will they speak your language? Who knows!
---
but then his mage water will disappear
---
Reported gl.
---
Thank you haha. So far I’ve learned that I’m not having fun, despite stating the opposite. And that I should just quit.
---
Took me about about 20h of farming in Winterspring. I averaged 52mobs/h so i had to kill about 1k for the Blue Sinew.  
---
Am currently stuck on Solenor, cant seem to kill it. Gonna try it tonight with a Warlock for the Curse.
---
Got him 6 times to &lt;10% without a Lock and each time he evaded randomly for literally no reason so if i have to deal with that im not trying it again with the RNG fear on top.
---
Haha it’s only for the people who don’t ask politely or feel entitled to others utility, if anyone asks me politely I will always oblige
---
This feels possible. Have you looked into it at all yet?
---
If you don't use it, they'll flame you. If you do, they'll flame you for your gear. 
---
Those kinds will always find a reason. 
---
Do whatever you want. You still gonna get flamed.
---
i sure did
---
I mean that is 21 months worth of talent tweaking between 1.1 and 1.12. I’m not saying it is the only factor but it is a fair point.
---
Unfortunately we've had to
---
It is demoralizing. When MC and Ony were clesred week 1 it was demoralizing. It makes the game seem much smaller knowing players have already seen it all and youre barely out the starting zone.
---
People say it doesnt matter but it does. I know 2 people who couldnt believe the news about MC and Ony and have barely played since. 
---
Anyone who was hoping to raid and maybe compete amongst the top 10 guilds of the server probably gave up if they werent near 60 week 1 after seeing the raids dropped.
---
Having unbeaten content improves the game. Just how it is. Makes it feel larger and makes it feel like the game is in charge, not the players. 
---
Im not even sure why Method plays Classic. It isnt a challenge to them
---
Oh man Hillsbrad farmers made me finally decide to make my hunter alt my new main (for now) instead of my warrior. They respawned too fast, ran away, resisted my howl. I threw in the towel after three attempts. I did not have it in me for more and I probably won't play on her for a bit. Still salty
---
i don't know about you, but i played the game back then and it wasn't an issue then and it won't be now. i don't know if you are coming from a private server or not but it's not that serious
---
So you're telling me that when you're tanking, you equip a 2H sword and sit in Berserker Stance for 4-6 auto attacks, praying you don't miss, when you're fighting a group of mobs? This sounds like the worst idea ever. I always get healers telling me about their nightmare groups with bad tanks. I've always wondered how someone could fail at such an easy thing. Now I see how.
---
For that amount of rage, I've put out a Demo Shout, and like 4 Sunders and probably at least 1 Revenge.
---
And we never got a Scarlet Crusade raid : (
---
Eh, i also work fulltime 9-5, i'm 60 with 7/8 T1 and a lvl 30 twink.
---
And even i say it's too fast.
---
It's hugely more mana efficient. Blizzard really only kicks in at 4+ enemies IME
---
By banning someone &amp; everyone involved they're getting involved with a political statement and taking clear sides.
---
Blacksmith keys are frickin expensive though, if they spend their mats on opening the chest, it's rightfully theirs imo. Contents are probably worth less than the mats for the keys anyway.
---
Here is the rule Blizzard said he broke: 
---
&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms. 
---
Blizzard is selectively enforcing that to say "Do anything that offends the Chinese government and we'll ban you".  That's the problem.
---
“Huh!”
---
*fuck*.
---
Only Karma is a bitch.
---
That’s true in that I’m just one part of the global economy and that I can’t completely control where my money ends up, but I can still help by supporting more ethical/responsible orgs (which tend to be smaller and more local) and not directly putting money into the pockets of the worst offenders.
---
lol i make big $ on this shift and theres no traffic both ways which is nice
---
i do take advantage of this, and often talk in general in my zone to the other lonely adventurers.
---
Blizzard censoring Hong-Konger on their platforms at the request of Chinese autorities I wager.
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't stick to their rules and ban the player. I'm saying blizz shouldn't kiss China's ass and purge any tie to the event, such as the jobs of the people doing the interviews. But thats the reality today. China has their hands in half of the country.
---
and they can do that,
---
but they dont have to brake the rules to do so, they can post it on twitter or make a video dedicated to it on youtube or what not,
---
but doing so while streaming a game where this is not allowed is not helping
---
You could start playing after phase 2 and STILL not be to far behind. Enjoy yourself, youll be 60 soon. People will be running alll level dungeons forever, perpetually.
---
In my experience warlocks are just barely above rogues and hunters in pugs
---
Pugs only ever want one warlock and they would rather want to stack up to 3 of the better spellcaster mages
---
Late replying but yeah. Having limited time to play made me almost reroll onto a PvE server. I love PvP but when it is fair and balanced. Getting corpse camped by a gnome rogue that /spits and teabags you is so infuriating... I hope you get to 60. What's your in game name?
---
Then they go and pull while your sat there with no water, no mana and no buffs. I feel that, sucks and happened a lot during my Dungeon runs. It’s the reason I started just doing IB pulls in ZF onward
---
And sold.
---
Oh right that's different. I was thinking about rnchanters in general
---
Doesn't Ragnaros pretty much only need one tank? And, say you've got 8 healers, that still leaves 31 people to go full dps on him.
---
TIL warriors get paid in scents.
---
They're not mutually exclusive :)
---
He really doesn't. 
---
You can make your own group and then you can decide exactly the kind of loot rules you want - too lazy to do that? I guess you'll have to deal with the rules of someone who's less lazy than you.
---
no changes dude
---
I've settled with feign death and passive pet on one key then ice trap on another key
---
reddit is bought and paid for by Chinese investors
---
start there
---
The thing about it is this, if you are hamstring kiting towards next mob, pop SSs when u are about to tag next mob, you are saving downtime. Bandage/bloodrage to next group of 2-3, kill 7-10 mobs and full eat
---
This is Blizzard.
---
&gt; That's how the game works, it you don't like it don't invite other players who need it
---
Yes... that's what he's doing..? :D
---
Well you must be talking about in your guild. I'm talking about outside of guilds.
---
if there are 15 people who did this and they are the only ones who got banned then yea, this would be bad.
---
but if the they ban people for breaking rules no matter the agends this is fine
---
amen brother.
---
There is a difference if they are doing it in a blizzard hosted EVENT. Lets say asmonbold wants to preach his political views on HIS stream. Nobody can do ANYTHING about it.
---
So comparing this to "other big streamers" is irrelevant.
---
I was wondering, can Druid farm anything from Dire Maul or something?
---
This is too early Blizz ...
---
Yeah, I'm so delusional because I'm using my own anecdote to draw an opinion of the fact that some people believe you CANT be 60 and work a 9-5.
---
That's all I'm saying. You dont have to play like I did - I went from 28-52 on b0th chats through SM/ZF because I've done that bracket about 3 times on private servers and countless times on retail pre-cata already.
---
So they probably did offend a Portion or group of the Public. Keep your fucking own opinion at Home. Me and Others are there for the Game and not any political bullshit you might Care about yourself.
---
I have a lvl 50 priest and a 44 rogue and I'm thinking about starting a 2nd alt. What would you oh so mighty redditers suggest? Im not interested in the mage class.
---
Saw lvl1 whorde druid in burning steppes. Maybe exploit of some sort but I want to believe he was exploring the world
---
currently lvling a mage to be able to blink from SW auctionners to mailbox
---
Nothing...?
---
If it wasn't changed back then, it won't be touched now.
---
Link?
---
Warcraft: UBI edition? Would be interesting.
---
Very early to say. Most of the community is divided. Classic+,tbc-wotkl, reset, keep the classic servers running for ever in naxx patch. 
---
Let the game run in naxx patch for some months and then ask the players how they feel.
---
BIS until 8pc T1 for hunter. BIS until AQ40 for warrior.
---
Facing innkeeper to terrify her for the millionth time that day when a random person just pops out of existence in front of her all over again.
---
Plus am Forsaken.
---
Exactly! I don’t expect anyone else’s utility why should they expect mine. WoWs gameplay is social dependency, with out sociaizing the game falls hard so if people want buffs or drinks etc they should be polite and social :D 
---
Oof that must of sucked, I always help a warrior if I can it’s rough as it is for them haha
---
You can also be at 10% health fighting a mob, have a rogue come up to gank you (definitely not me, definitely not) and turn around and 2 shot said rogue with 2 WW axe autoattack crits.
---
Fuck warriors.
---
Even local stores buy product from the "worst offenders" to resell, or the tools in which they use to operate their business.
---
Let's do some Ding-Dong PvP then?
---
Very well indeed
---
Tar lurkers ability is an AoE.  Just run away when it casts and run back in when it starts moving again.  I learned this after dealing with that debuff a couple of times due to not being able to stop it otherwise.
---
i like it
---
they enforced their rules, not took a stance
---
That's a gross oversimplification of the Tencent investment, not quite the same thing
---
so you are comparing giving consumables that cost you mana to people's most desirable specs playtime?
---
Not saying it's the norm, but you can play just over half of that time and be 60 if you play properly and dont AFK your time away. 
---
I probably averaged 2-3 hours a night after the first week, where I was aying very long days due to hype of being off work and getting into a good rhythm of playing.
---
Damn, you've got a good warrior friend if he's willing to pass on it (unless you mean you're going until you get 2 drops, or he already has one).
---
Yeah, hopefully this doesn't become the NEW meta. Unlike classic with the 'Omen/KTM installed or no raid' meta.
---
What if they were showing support for a terrorist organisation or incited racist violence?
---
oh, so you're not actually willing to give up anything if it inconveniences you, just push other people to do it
---
gotcha
---
Even if I jave enslaved pets?
---
It means whenever there is any chance of anything offending the Chinese government, whether it's game content or content creators or streamers, Blizzard will side with the Chinese government in WoW too.
---
So let's say the designers are planning on making an expansion with some skeletons in it.  If the Chinese government says "actually we don't want skeletons anywhere in the game in any region", then Blizzard will say "yes sir".
---
Or if the designers make a quest that's about an oppressed tribe of monks fighting for freedom from an oppressive regime and China says "that reminds us too much of Tibet, delete it," then Blizzard will say "yes, sir"
---
And beyond that it's important to be able to empathize with others and criticize a company even if you aren't directly harmed.  Otherwise, when it comes the time for you to be affected, no one will show the empathy towards you that you lacked towards others.
---
 Because it is not her you are killing on consecutive runs after you save her.  
---
If all members of the group already saved the princess, she's replaced by another npc.
---
And here I thought those in this world would be sheltered from the turmoil outside of it.
---
Nice guide man.
---
I hope my ele can atleast do lashers
---
Gotta district you from all the felatio blizzard is giving China.
---
yes it does
---
mana is exp/gold 
---
to conjure food/water u use ur mana which u could be using for farming  therefore it costs u
---
That's...not what I said at all
---
This is why I switcher to Hunter after getting my warrior to level 18 lol.
---
Yeah, it's fucked. The Chinese like to play underhanded with anything they do.
---
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism
---
Sorry, I didn't know you were an authority on what everyone should care for.
---
&gt; This isn't how it was in vanilla 
---
Uhm. Yes it was. Fresh level 60? Farm dungeons for items.  
---
Guild raiding? Tier 1/2 chase  
---
BWL released? More Tier2 chase. Also clout.  
---
Battlegrounds? Exalted (for items) and rank 14 chase  
---
AQ and ZG? More gear chase  
---
Naxx? If you're not level 60 and clearing BWL and AQ40 you have a lot of chasing to do  
---
If you're in a guild doing Naxx, chase Winterspring rep for months just to get a mount.  
---
Oh shit they released TBC, chase over.
---
Vanilla was all about gear chase. An incredibly small percentage of the wow population could actually feel "done". Then they'd level an alt and do it all over again.
---
They don't care about his thoughts. They care about one of their biggest markets not banning their products
---
I currently run Skinning/Mining, so I can afford mount at 40 (which I succeeded) as well as epic mount at 60 (when I get there). I was wondering if I should re-roll professions at 56-57ish for Tailoring (as I am a priest), so I could have something like Truefaith Vestments.
---
I tend to raid a bit, but I think I'm more inclined to mainly have fun doing PvP.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Sounds about right. Wenn I meet a paladin out in the world taking mines, pretty much my only way to beat them is going reck immediately and nuke em hard. They dont bubble fast enough or they do and I move 10yards to bandage. Then going in again. If he has LoH you can only hope for some lucky crits. Popping a FAP to counteract engi and the everlasting HoJ is mandatory in my book.
---
I cancelled my sub. As much as I enjoyed playing WoW classic I can't in good conscience keep giving money to a company that values income from an awful oppresive dictatorship over that of personal freedom of people. Really horrible of them to fire the casters and ban the hearthstone player. I was also going to apply for them for an internship - it's been my dream to work for Blizzard for years but now I absolutely will not.
---
Warriors are always useful - nice having a tank
---
Despite the abomination I have become I will never forget my ancestry
---
...mon
---
With any game, or thing in life, you can't expect to get the same skill and power as someone who has put in 10x the amount of time you have into something. The reason P2W is so fought against is because it means you don't need to spend the time in game, you can just pay with real money to attain the same status/power.
---
No matter your hardship, you were always able to grin and bear it.
---
How do you let your pet keep the aggro? I can't have my pet keep aggro on more than 1 mob. I can't tab switch target fast enough before they're on me and then I need to run to get some distance while my pet is taking dmg...
---
no, it means you must not distribute your own political or ethnical agenda if you have a big audience because it will hurt the game.
---
this is completly fine, they can express there belives and thoughts over instagramm and twitter if they like,
---
they must not do this while streaming where this is breaking the rules
---
Then that would be completely different from supporting a democratic protest movement, so I don't see why you're trying to equate them.
---
Not all ideologies are equivalent and it's daft to pretend otherwise.  Blizzard and many players publicly support the gay rights movement?  Is that equivalent to supporting the Taliban?  Of course not, don't be absurd.
---
Ah, so this is their strategy to not break “no phase 2 while layering exists” promise. Content is gonna trickle out, but they’ll wait on honor or something which is what they’ll arbitrarily decide is the defining feature of phase 2.
---
Hi, /u/DerKerl112

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dey022/shammy_dps_dosnt_understand_why_healer_needs_on/). 
---
You say this, but the BRD torchroom XP farm was first nerfed, and then removed completely. 
---
Not saying both farms are completely the same and will be handled accordingly because i do think there's a lot more skill involved in pulling off the DM:E farm. But Blizzard have made changes to their original content nonetheless.
---
All in all you made a good call. If you can’t control it, stop it. 
---
I was in a similar situation, was definitely addicted back in 2005 (and I wasn’t even a raider back then, I only started raiding with TBC). I started classic recently and I feel the same urges. Gladly, I have too much work and a girlfriend what automatically only allows me a few hours per week.
---
I feel like player skill has advanced so much that there won't be a market like the one you describe.
---
So it's not a problem about how it's not related about Blizzard and therfore classic wow but that you don't like Hong Kong protest. 
---
Then I told you that I don't say someone not cancelling subscription is a monster or whatever but just that it's worth mentionning so your last part isn't relevant at all
---
Wait, so if I started streaming WoW, Blizzard could have a say in what I talk about? Isn't that in direct conflict with most western countries freedom of speech? Is this weitten somewhere in the EULA?
---
But they didn't... hypothetical situations get us nowhere fast.
---
&gt; try **scripting**in most games and they ban you. Blizzard just lets you do it.
---
I don't think this word means what you think it means...
---
Maybe tanaris and ungoro worth it but I didnt go there either because of the amount of horde.
---
😂😂😂😂 hahaha salty
---
Players (and Blizzard themselves) express support for stuff like gay rights all the time without Blizzard banning them.
---
Blizzard is banning here 100% only because of pressure from China.
---
I’m a mage on Mograine and can neither confirm nor deny that we tamper with the water
---
how do u know which version it will be ?
---
Just take any dps. I particularly enjoy hunters and the hybrid dps guys. A good hunter can just solo one of the mobs in a pack, and most hybrid DPS players are just so happy about getting to dps they focus really hard on doing well.
---
A tank gets a random tell asking to run a instance. More than half the time he will deny if he doesn't see the word "tip". that's expecting payment. They know someone else will send them a tell with that word so they will wait.
---
Post in the link was deleted, this is close enough

---
Wow lol most people who beg for gold are likely to give you back 0 instead. Good for both of you.
---
too high level for the zone.
---
It's not related to Classic WoW. That's like saying the new Heroes of the Storm update is related to Classic WoW because Blizzard operates Heroes of the Storm. I don't care about this because it's faux outrage.
---
Damn I think I had the same experience with boars in Westfall when I started out there
---
Compulsory liquidation = bankrupt
---
Talked about this with some guildies.  Was wondering if the additional green itemized items(+healing,+dmg) being added later in messed with the loot tables at all.  I can easily walk out of a random 60 dungeon with 20-30 gold in trash drops.  Not sure it was quite so lucrative in 1.1 etc.
---
I play off-peak too, and on a small server, but it's still something to idly do. Thanks for the info!
---
&gt; Wait, so if I started streaming WoW, Blizzard could have a say in what I talk about?
---
Yes, in that they can ban you from the game and take away your prize money if you offend China.
---
They're legally allowed to do that because their EULA says "we can ban you for any reason at any time" like most game EULAs do.
---
This is way to soon. Why are they ramping it up when they should be slowing things down? I get that hard core raiders want more content and that they are tired of the content they have already.  
---
But they can do what everyone else does and explore the world instead of living in their hard core bubble. Releasing Dire Maul may not affect me too much as a lowly level 32 warrior who plays a few hours every night and makes sure to level my fishing and cooking and mining and having fun with some quests here and there, BUT I don't want Blizzard to rush things and before we know it Naxx is out and what then?
---
Kang is King for Shamans oneshotting stuff
---
Eastern plaguelands is the best class, but only flight masters can roll them so its kinda barrens chat.
---
Lol to each his own. 
---
Where do you start with that?
---
Democratic or not is your personal opinion that may not be shared with every Chinese person. That's why they enforce no-politics rule. It's not always "black and white". Just look at the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
---
Perbert?
---
I mean it makes sense, company doesnt want to bring politics into their game - and has a part in the TOS basically saying that
---
Again, massive thanks to everyone who has supported me on this journey. Genuinely didn’t think this was possible just a few short days ago.
---
I have a heard time believing any of that would hold up in court.
---
Is there any way to influence a rarespawn spawning? IE: If I kill mobs around that area does it increase the chance of spawn, similar to how fishing Firefin Snapper schools in a zone will force respawns of more profitable schools like Floating Wreckage?
---
If the next retail xpac has good class design changes then it would be an easy switch. M+/fast paced and skillful pve content is my favourite thing to do in wow, classic/TBC wouldn't come close to scratching that itch
---
&gt;So let's say the designers are planning on making an expansion with some skeletons in it.  If the Chinese government says "actually we don't want skeletons anywhere in the game in any region", then Blizzard will say "yes sir".  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Or if the designers make a quest that's about an oppressed tribe of monks fighting for freedom from an oppressive regime and China says "that reminds us too much of Tibet, delete it," then Blizzard will say "yes, sir"
---
You do realize that China's version of WoW is already completely different and custom to China right?
---
Just toss some cheap heal the warlock's way when you can and don't heal them to full.  
---
Locks level with affli spec so their drain life heals well and having them topped off is a waste of resources.  
---
Warlocks who just life tap to 1 DPSing like mad and complain for the lack of heals are just bad.
---
TukUI
---
Thing is you wont see this Item on the Ah. Maybe once or twice over a year.
---
You guys get to fight?
---
Alright, I hope you’re right and I’ve just had bad luck. Thanks!
---
Just cancelled my sub and uninstalled the launcher and all blizzard titles. Fuck this company
---
Kill the lesser versions of the tar mobs a bit more south. Lower hp and dont give the debuff. They do disarm though.
---
&gt; Lets say asmonbold wants to preach his political views on HIS stream. Blizzard cant do ANYTHING about it (other than maybe pressure twitch)
---
Actually they could.  They could ban his accounts, because the TOS of WoW says they can basically ban you for any reason at any time.
---
So based on the Hearthstone actions, if the Chinese government got offended by something Asmo said on stream and told Blizzard "ban that guy", then Blizzard would.  Only reason it hasn't happened yet is because no big streamer has offended the Chinese government yet.
---
But if you wait until it happens until you realize the type of company Blizzard is, then it'll be too late because you ignored their actions in their other games.
---
Funny how much everyone is complaining that it’s “too soon”. Didn’t you guys realize that classic would be the one place where Blizzard DOESN’T cater to casuals?
---
I really hate Ashenvale and STV
---
You nailed the price!
---
Install this addon, it will help find groups https://github.com/DomenikIrrgang/ClassicLFG
---
I dont play, I only log on for raid night I have my epic mount, professions maxed (yes fishing too) and a second character sitting on level 46 atm but not motivated to max him just for twinkraid.
---
I see enough guilds who spam for pug MC runs because their guild has too many 60s and they cant run MC with all of them.
---
But its also not too difficult to reach 60, unless you play 2 hours per week and you care more about picking some herbs and selling your greens on the auction house while others have a guild with dedicated groups who farm dungeons and do quests in 5 man groups.
---
Yes we know each other from private servers, yes we leveled tons of toon up to max (also on BC pservers) and yes if you dont care at all boohoo casual just doing casual things sure you wont be 60 quickly.
---
Thing is, it doesnt matter if we get more content now or not because if you arent near 60 it doesnt affect you in any way shape or form, it only affect us because we now get more dungeons to clear.
---
If you arent 60 now you have no interest in min/maxing gear anyway, so the couple new items from DM arent changing anything for you and you can still crawl to 60 while others have 10 days+ playtime on 60.
---
Just because YOU dont like to have more content now because YOU arent ready for it doesnt mean there are enough people out there who are and who deserve it which ultimately seems to be the reason why blizzard releases the content -&gt; they can see how many people are ready for it.
---
The high attack speed is not great, but the next best thing before [Ashjrethul](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19361/ashjrethul-crossbow-of-smiting) has like 11 less DPS. So yeah, it's great compared to the alternatives.
---
The staff is excellent for PvP (big dick raptor strikes, high stamina), but there are better choices for PvE.
---
Friends are playing: Arms Warrior, Holy Paladin, Disc Priest  
---
What would be a good class for PvP/BG's (when released) to go with those classes?
---
Always remember the guilds. I bet there are a lot of guilds on your server still recruiting.
---
That's untrue. DM existed before MC runs.
---
Where should you draw the line? They weren't declaring their support for a humanitarian or environmental change. They were protesting in favour of one political system/situation over another.
---
Thanks for sharing, opiates are nasty. Lost some friends recently as a result of opiates/heroin, scary stuff. Thanks for your encouragement!

---
Pursuit of justice, is it worth taking? 
---
With minor speed enchant to boots the only benefit is the 8% mount speed. How essential is that in BGs? I can’t see it being worth taking over say 2 points in Parry or vindication.
---
Thoughts?
---
go back to retail if you want more casual friendly game...
---
Ohhh... I'm sorry, I did not realize. That was an extremely dick move then.
---
Yes, I'm saying that if China said "make all regions use the China version", then Blizzard would.  Recent events have shown that Blizzard will do essentially whatever China tells them to do, regardless of morality or design principles.
---
You die every 30 years?
---
That epic sword... I want it so badly.
---
Y'all cowards dont even smoke crack!
---
So other people having/making more time to play, is a reason you didn't login ?
---
Do you play this game for your own entertainment or to keep up with other players? 
---
It's not a race mate, some people are still level 20 and some have alts at 60 already. Just enjoy the ride
---
I had a feeling people were probably using some kind of add on to make it easy like retail. Funny thing is most other people are commenting that I need to go play retail. How poetic
---
be water, my friend
---
Have you killed the demons yet? Im getting smashed on them.
---
Wonder if you told him it was MS &gt; OS or just expected to get your own way. 
---
Either way a shitty move from him but somehow doubt it was communicated before hand
---
Who cares lmao
---
They are nice to have on dps-race fights, though.
---
Last week I was sick. One night I logged off around 2AM and went to bed. Around 4AM I woke up covered in sweat (cuz sick), got up, took a shower and used the very early morning hours to farm Stranglethorn for 3h. No, I don't have a problem... Not at all...
---
Legally speaking, freedom of speech does not protect you from companies banning you based on your speech.
---
&gt;It’s the one thing in this game that pisses me off, just opening a trade window in silence?! Sort ya self out fuck nugget...
---
But thats just the fastest way? And if you dungeon a lot I think plenty of mages dont really carea bout a convo that goes "can i get waterz pls, kthx" - "sure here you go"
---
Warrior
---
Ok thanks for the reply I’m leveling as enhance I hear it’s quicker then i plan to respec and try out both to see which one I like more!
---
Glad you’ve made the decision to get better. It totally sucks, don’t get me wrong, but every minute without it gets easier ever so slightly. As my therapist once said “it’s not all high fives and handjobs”, but it definitely gets more and more manageable as time goes on.
---
People will constantly start new alts, so nobody is truly left behind. More so after they have stabilized their economy for raiding, got all the prebis they can...
---
No, [nopet] will be wrong while you control a commandable pet (summons like the ones from the barov bell don't count)
---
Or in other words: [pet] is true when you have an enslaved demon.
---
Found Freezing Band yesterday c:
---
Switch up your binds so you can do it fast. I have pet attack on scrollwheel forward. And most of the time i will have a marked mob as focus, then i'll tab target switch my pet onto the 3 others and let it get a bite/growl off. Thats enough to keep aggro from just multishots.
---
And here and there i do get a runner, just tab&gt;scroll wheel forward. 
---
If you start the fight at maximum range you shouldent need to backtrack if you get a runner.
---
Oh cool thankyou! How does enchanting BOE items work? Do i have to have enchanting on my account to be able to do so or can other people still enchant them?
---
It's understandable, but what can you reasonably expect people to do. If they do or say nothing, no matter how small it may seem, then nothing will change. The US is too vast to support actual large scale protests unless a dramatic shift happens that affects everyone to a major degree and if that were to happen it would probably be too late to change anything. That's why when you see stuff like this, however pedantic and small it may seem, at least it's *something*. 
---
Complacency breeds mediocrity and every now and again people standing up like this does have an impact.
---
I dont get your problem in this thread. If youre not yet 60 and youre playing casually then thats fine, the content will still be there when you arrive. For others, this is a bit more content that was basically baseline with the game when it released (especially if you're European). 
---
People acting like classic having content out that theyre not ready for is a problem seem silly imho. There arent too many catch-up mechanica (DM &amp; ZG are the only two), so no matter when you hit 60, youre going to need to do the MC -&gt; BWL -&gt; Aq40 etc progression, so it changes very little.
---
WotLK!
---
Sounds like you raged a little bit? I don't see why you were spamming in caps when you could have wrote "I needed it because it's an upgrade for me too?"
---
I bought mine at level 44 and used it literally until 60. I didn't replace it until Stratholme. It's a very good weapon for Ret Paladin.
---
I still remember vividly this moment on my hunt, summer 2005.
---
Sure you did bud
---
You selectively enforcing that to say "You can't offend anyone except for Chinese"
---
Now only xbow from chomagg will boost your ass. GG bis up to Kel´thuzad.
---
I'm seeing lots of F's here but really fellas, it should be an S; S for satisfactory work.

Hunters make more with tribute farm anyway.
---
I play a 31/20 spec, doing top dps both on 2+ targets and single target. 
---
I basically just use MS &amp; Ww on cd and spam hamstring for WF procs. 
---
Might be a special case as I’ve got spinal reaver as orc
---
I think that any class can be either be funny or a nightmare to play according to who you're fighting and how good/geared you are..Pick the class that inspire you the most, if it click go with it or just re-roll... and don't fall into alt-holism!
---
&gt;So let me see if I get this.. People who fell behind because of irl and/or wanting to experience the game in a different pace (all good btw), are whining because new content that doesn't really affect them comes live sooner. Nice...
---
Yeah, this is pretty ironic and funny to read, because the complaints are word to word the same as they were in 2005 and 2006. These complaints are the exact reason why there's dungeon finder, streamlined quests, sharding, etc. in retail now.
---
Id tank but all you dps got to 60 too fast, here i an at 46 begging to tank a zul farrak
---
Ive seen mixed answers on how many mats the dreadsteed chain requires. Wowhead gives me completely different mat numbers. Is there a confirmed source somewhere?
---
No, I'm saying that's what Blizzard is doing.  They are using that rule to justify banning anyone who offends China specifically.
---
I think stance dancing drops you from combat so you can change you weapons. You can't equip a shield mid fight otherwise.
---
Shouting people 😂🤦‍♂️
---
you should look up how to woosh.
---
note since i seem to be giving the wrong vibes. The shaman was enh and was absolutely about to ninja cause he needed gold. also dont sit here and act high and mighty cause i used caps lol.
---
Who's still running Deadmines lol.
---
Even if the US was 10 times worse than it is at this moment, it's still light years better than anything China related. I wish for a really big plague on every single human being that supports China.
---
Yep, Cancelled today and uninstalled. Im so sad, was taking a break but was so excited to get back to raiding. I guess DM will have to wait until Blizz has a spine.
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Why should we care?
---
“Can’t sleep at night”
---
Like blizzard cares about your well being
---
How much more difficult will it be to level as hemo rogue vs the combat rogue I have been playing as. Just hit 36 and getting tired of getting ganged 24/7 and feel I’ll have a better shot as sub build. Only thing I will really be missing is blade flurry for taking on two at a time. Anything else?
---
What.
---
They were 10s a piece.
---
I’d even say that tailoring is worth picking up before 60.  Some of the pieces you craft like the dreamweave collection are really good for levelling. I’m personally planning to rock Tailoring/Skinning until 60.
---
In reverse, that’s how I got my dad addicted to WoW.
---
Get more accounts and sit a lvl 1 in every layer, instant invite your main if it spawn and kill it but tbh if you want to get it you basically cant have s job or a live just camp him for 16 hours a day and get lucky. Killed him twice so far but no drop
---
And what happens in ten years when China demands Blizzard censor all references to Xi Jinping and Winnie the Poo on American servers? Or they demand Blizzard/Epic/Whatever start banning specific IPs of Americans the Chinese government doesn't like?
---
Are we all just going to throw our arms up in the air and say "oh well they've got no choice"? The CCP isn't going to just stop making demands after this one time. 
---
Eventually a line has to be drawn in the sand, and Blizzard, at the very least, should start feeling heat from any customers that don't like having aspects of their lives controlled by Winnie the Poo 10,000 miles away.
---
If you haven't being playing on Fridays or Saturdays and you had a 4 day vacation then you've had 27 days to play WoW. In that time you've invested 10 days into the game.
---
That's about 9 hours every single day for six weeks straight.
---
I hope you're lying because if not that's pretty bad.
---
no u
---
Unless they're willing to abolish the system in which these conditions are created the idea that not buying from X company is pointless because people *have* to buy from certain companies. Whether it's because of ease of access, locales where there are no other options, prices that they can afford etc. The blame or action to change cannot be changed by small individual efforts but by large collective actions which no one is willing to do because it disrupts their own lifestyle.
---
No you both
---
Yea you need to heal/decurse a bunch of peasants and sometimes skeletons spawn to attack you. The skeletons only have 100 hp but there's like 4-5 of them at a time so it's hard to deal with if you have no AOE. You can use downranked holy nova to one-shot them (and downranked everything really, because mana can be an actual concern), otherwise the common trick is to use immolation oil which gives you a 50 damage aoe for a few seconds, but it means the skeletons get to punch you a few times and it can get stressful.
---
I've recorded a video of me doing it as shadow spec (which is essentially the same as going in with no talents at all): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4RFHaD8Z0U
---
Any mentions of where's the original content?
---
Loved the video! Hope you get to study abroad eventually mate
---
objective standard of what? I am not trying to level efficiently, I am completing all quests before grey efficiently, which isn't so easy as there is no guide for horde to do this (i have had to make my own) and it also requires running all dungeons at the appropriate level.
---
33 ally priest on Gandling too! I find the same at the moment trying to find a group, especially tanks, but questing is the way forward anyway!
---
Tournament player called for freedom for Hong Kong in a post-game interview. Blizzard promptly cut the stream, fired the two casters and banned the player, desperately scrambling to censor and block before their Chinese masters get displeased.
---
What would be the benefit of a druid?
---
Yep. I started playing some months after the initial release. DM was in the game (pretty much released with the game in the EU), people were farming MC and Ony. By the time I hit 60, people were attempting BWL. That was the ordinary game experience for most people in vanilla. A lot of players played from day 1, but most joined a while later when the hype became too big to ignore. 
---
Guilds were popping up left and right, because most players didn't have Tier1, and the best guilds were already full. Same thing will happen now. Everyone will be able to find a guild and do the content at their own pace. While the top guilds were clearing BWL and attempting AQ40, LOADS of guilds were still stuck in MC, Ony, AQ20 and ZG. It takes time to gear up 40+ people. 
---
Everyone will be able to enjoy the game and take part in the vanilla experience as long as Blizzard spreads out the raid content at a reasonable pace.
---
Okay, WHERE is this 6% hit with 305 WS coming from? I’ve heard it repeated so many times, but I’ve looked up and down and I can’t find any indication that this is correct. With 305 WS, as stated by the blue post, you need 8% instead of 9%. Nowhere does it say you now need 6%. Not saying you’re not correct, but what’s your source on this information?
---
Yeah I just feel like people who say that they don't want the servers to progress to TBC and onwards simply have no clue why they say that or either they fail to consider the fact that the community will just suck when playing a stagnant end-game. Phase 6 might be awesome for a long while, maybe for as long as 8 months, but continuing for a year would be absolutely devestating to most servers. It might have been a viable plan if there were only one or two servers doing that though.
---
Good post. Too bad it is drowned out by "but I'm not lvl 60 yet!", already pushed to page 2.
---
Their dm release is roughly following the EU release date back in the day. Nobody was 60 yet back then either. Also waiting for everyone to catch up is never possible. 
---
Btw I'm not lvl 60 yet.
---
Gender has no advantage
---
Saw him spawn after 30 hours
---
No advantage to playing an overplayed race , faction, or gender.
---
If they do 6 months of MC/Ony being the only raid content, they're gonna have retention problems at max level.
---
Ion murdered my family upvotes to the left 😎
---
I think I'd start picking up Tailoring (and dropping mining), when I hit 50-53. Right now, I just get my friend to craft me stuff - like Dreamweave Circlet.
---
I hadn't played in 8 years, it's amazing how fast classic got its hooks in me. I know the feeling. Good luck!
---
Miss, parry, block, dodge oh snap over power motherfucker........miss.
---
So what's your stance on selling arms to Saudi Arabia, or drone tech to Egypt, or trading with North Korea.
---
You mean Dead Maul, idiot...
---
Classic + sounds nice in theory but have you seen Naxxramas gear? It’s already a huge power spike if we increase that more with another raid new 60s would be one shotted by hardcore raiders.
---
And the day reddit starts censoring my anti-Winnie-the-Poo comments is the day I stop coming here.
---
&gt; The context may be 5 mans, but when the guy has this fixed raid expense multiple times per week,
---
But everyone (that raids) has fixed raid expenses multiple times per week, I don't see the difference between him and others in that regard. 
---
&gt; he's not going to pay for regular water for 5 mans.
---
I don't know why this was aimed at me. I never advocated for people should have to pay for water. 
---
I don't really understand the relevance of the remainder of what you wrote. Feel free to elaborate.
---
Bad rule then. Post victory shoutouts are a prime place for politics and they'll always be. 
---
Attempting to levy a ban there is just wanting authority.
---
I did stand behind him but they just cam and attacked me and didn't even try to attack him. So he just sat there casting and not attacking :/
---
Ouch.
---
Fucking right. It's pathetic, they only care enough when it doesn't effect them. All to play a 10 year old game.
---
seems normal pretty normal for a gamer  excep they dont sleep 8 hours a night
---
Sure but what I'm trying to say is that decisions like that don't just happen all at once. The world never says in the same instant 'Okay we're just not going to do X anymore'. It needs to start somewhere, and this is how it starts.
---
If you have a better idea then by all means run for office on those ideals and show people how to do it properly. As of now this is the best we have and I'm not going to spend time trying to tell people it's futile when it's all a massive process that takes years.
---
As Druid you are able to do stealth runs.  
---
If you have a rouge friend or another druid you can do higher dungeons as well.
---
Yes you have 1 min cd on your aoe spell but remember you have to loot the mobs and drink for mana. This one minute is not that much if you think like this. If you have barkskin with lvl 44 just try it.
---
Why tf are you guys playing this game when Blizzard is such a trash company?
---
Doable. Getting shit organized tho...
---
Just like any state trying to get independence from US like California right?
---
Warrior is a good suggestion but you may feel it’s a little similar to a Warrior (a fury one at least). Maybe try a true hybrid like a Druid or Pally so you can also get your tanking fix?
---
if you work for a company, and you got out voice your distaste of your customers of your company, bet your ass you get terminated... nothing to see here
---
You're completely misunderstanding the situation here. 
---
The point is to make it untenable for companies to work with these dictatorships, to make the logic youre describing illogical by exerting the pressure we have as consumers to force companies to act ethically.
---
what happened? Why is blizzard getting boycotted?
---
Life sucks, then you marry someone who doesn’t.
---
Marked as CCP shill for this comment.
---
It's not about taking a stand against China, it's moreso that Blizzard is silencing and banning people for Chinese dissent.
---
does this include PVP to RPPVP, if so im sad, i realized too late i need some RP in my life.
---
Dear Blizzard, please stop allowing streamers boredom to dictate when to bring out more content. Less then probably 5% of the population is 60. Tha J you.

we don't want to hang out with you, we just want the brownies your mom makes

&lt;Exhausted&gt; US-Westfall
---
Exhausted is a new alliance guild on Westfall switching from the horde side due to population issues. We are looking for new members dedicated to the game. Currently re-rolling means re-leveling, but during the switch we would like to build a core that is ready to raid in 1-2 months minimum. Our current needs are social members, but also people who plan to strive for endgame content. Everyone is welcome to join, but at the same time we will be looking to build several raid ready rosters for split MC/Ony runs, as well as a community to push PvP rank in phase 2+. 
---
    Warriors: Need All
---
    Rouges: Need All
---
    Mages: Need All
---
    Priests: Need All
---
    Warlocks: Need All
---
    Druids: Need All
---
    Paladins: Need All
---
    Hunters: Need All
---
Exhausted is built on the hope of obtaining several core rosters to push each phase in classic WoW, and we need people who are willing to persist in that goal. We want like minded individuals who are willing to help others and be a part of a community.
---
These are the current raid times.
---
Sunday 8-11 pm server time
---
Monday 8-11 pm server time
---
[Raid times may change as the core group is built]

&gt;Who are the Hong Kong protesters and what are they protesting?
---
Have you been living under a rock the past few months...?
---
I personally don't really like meleeing as much. Thus I would pick a Priest over a Paladin.
---
However, Paladin is not as uninteresting as I thought it was. My friend made me play one for "playing together" and it is level 30.
---
This made me more aware how weirdly other people play their paladins. They use Judgement everytime they can without thinking about the 5-second-rule and are oom after every pull. The whole seal-&gt;judement-concept adds another layer of complexity. It's a shame that it takes so long before the more interesting seals become available. The seal&amp;judge-mechanic is a nice trade-off between damage, utility and mana-preservation.
---
But when it comes to healing itself the Paladin is in a weird spot. For Priest and Druid the long-cast-time heal is also the more mana-efficient one and the short-casttime heal is the one for emergencies. For Paladins the long-cast-time heal is actually less mana-efficient but has way more throughput compared to the short one. The short one barely heals anything. It's great if you can't see people with non-full-health bars to top them off. But I had just gotten used to not doing because it usually is not very efficient.
---
Also itemization for Paladin is kinda funny. Not only can you wear almost everything, all the stats that exist are of some use to the paladin. And that's at the same time even.
---
Priest is more straightforward and intuitive I would say. And it is ranged, which is a big plus in my book. Also for healing itself I like it more. I also particularly like that it has offensive dispel in addition to the defensive one and that it has spells like Manaburn to really give it the upper hand against other healers.
---
Healing in PvP is even more fun than healing in PvP. Because your own positioning becomes even more relevant. Aswell as all the other things you can do. Dispelling (offensive and defensive), Manaburning, giving Seal of Freedom, etc.
---
Despite not liking Melee I main druid because of how I imagine PvP-Healing will be with it with the tools given to them. Stealth, Roots, Travel-Form, Anti-Stealth (Faery-Fire).
---
I'm always grouped with a Warrior when playing my Paladin, so I play it as holy. Best thing about that is that I don't have to care about armor class and can wear whatever I like for the stats. Can't really talk about how much Ret would differ from it.
---
For Priest I like that Wand-Spec and Spirit-Tap are basically the mandatory-leveling-talents and the rest is prettymuch your choice. I never attempted shadow because I simply felt it wasn't that big of an advantage in PvE, since I intended to do a lot of dungeoning and healing anyways. But in PvP they are brutal due to the random stuns from their other baseline talent and their tankyness in shadow-form. I actually played shadow in Cataclysm but I don't think that it is very comparable as the game was already vastly different.
---
Very unlikely since they don't have any strong aoe. Maybe with engineering.
---
I sleep
---
Gotta love being on the over populated faction. You guys badasses.
---
Some people just like to live in their bubble and pretend everything on the outside is okay
---
It's all a massive process that can never be fulfilled within the scope of the current system within which we live. You can't  "Run for office to change this" because you're attempting to mold the system rather than replace it altogether. If you try to change the system from within it's not you who changes the system it's the system that changes you.
---
My sub ends in a week. Looking for a similar time sink atm. ESO? POE? Maybe Lineage II classic? Not familiar with FF franchise at all...
---
Sounds like they need some tegredy
---
Are you dense? Or just a chinese bot? He's saying that if Blizzard allows one type of political message or opinion it should allow all of them. Why is offending China any worse than offending homophobes? At least homophobes aren't going around harvesting organs, genociding an ethnic group, and oppressing an autonomous city.
---
No, choose either its your own aesthetical choice.
---
I only noticed that on emperor thaurissan (or whatever he's called) but I assumed it was related to ironfoe
---
Holy shit fuck blizzard for this

Be careful of what you wish. Propaganda is a really, really efficient mecanism and a lot of us are victim of it. I'm maybe exagerating but for me, An European blaming poverty on immigrants, an American blaming criminality on black people, A Chinese claming Taiwan is Chinese property are all victim of the same thing. Defending interest that aren't them but ready to die for it. Propaganda.

Coordination is going to be a wall for quite a few guilds.

I've been leveling by myself, I kinda see wow as a semi-social break from my actual social life
---
Hmm a druid sounds good to me, I hadn't thought of that. Thanks!
---
thats good hunter gear. for mend pet.
---
How do you figure?
---
Omg, you are a boss
---
Demonic for dummies teaches you demonic, I'm not sure that it's in the game already
---
There's that possibility, but even then I am pulling 20-30g an hour in one spot grinding mobs which drop grey items pretty easy, and that's gold out of thin air.
---
There's other more lucrative spots, but this one is easy for me as feral.
---
Worry about your own experience not that of others
---
Sorry I could find it posted but I didint dig deep. Imo even if it is posted a lot this needs to be heard.
---
As a 60 Rogue I find it super hard to find a group that wants me, so when I found a good tank that wanted to spam dungeons but required one drop to himself every dungeon took it no questions asked.
---
yeah guys stop having fun with a video game this guy has a political agenda to enforce 
---
For a less sarcastic response, \[please see the following\]( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Death\_of\_the\_Author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author) )

I'm not so sure about that. There were some pathing exploits used. Can never be sure how they will work at classic
---
Every day, as soon as I log in, first thing I do is find a mage in org to sell me 120 waters for 1g. Takes about 1 second to find one willing, and I can drink all I want the rest of the day and not worry about the cost.
---
just meming brother.
---
In a word: Yes.
---
(Bankruptcy is not a thing for companies in the uk, only individuals, but it's pretty much the same)
---
No you can't. You can bid on your own action tho with a reroll
---
From classic wowhead comments, around 100g I think?
---
do it
---
You can also put +9 spirit on level 1 required bracers, +100 hp to chest same deal, +7 str, and +5 weapon damage to a dagger.
---
QOL indeed!
---
Yeah keep politics out of video games.
---
Maybe they don’t want a fucking hearthstone event to be about politics? Did you tinfoilers consider that before you accuse everyone for working for the CCP?
---
Boycott Blizzard for shady business practices!

&gt; rogues dicking around before a pull.
---
There is a fine line for a Rogue to talk. Usually, I'll pickpocket one, MAYBE two mobs while the tank gets a good amount of threat, but only if I've stealthed ahead of the rest so I can just do it as the run by, then immediately get a mob's back for a gouge or backstab.
---
I'm guessing you're referring to those rogues who have to pickpocket EVERY mod on EVERY pull before they'll do any DPS?  Yeah, fuck those people.
---
Just cancelled my subscription. Wrote the following as my reason:
---
I am no longer going to play any of your games because of what you did regarding Blitzchung and the commenters. I have spent a lot of money on WoW and Hearthstone, and I am having a lot of fun with both. It's not the developers, I think they're doing a great job. It's the company.
---
How things change for you exactly?
---
Healers in general will be difficult to kill as any druid spec, but it's doable with the right items. Like you said, I guess we'll see how things go at 60, I certainly am very much looking forward to it :)
---
[Choose what's more important to you. Your hobbies or your morals. ](https://i.imgur.com/RQVKtF9.png)
---
He means the purple text
---
Why does everyone keep saying that there's simply not enough quests to get to level 60 and you will *have to* grind the last few levels?
---
I took this warning super seriously and in order to avoid this, I tried to visit all the available quest zones since about level 45,
---
but now I'm level 58 and I still haven't even touched BRD, LBRS, Western Plaguelands, Eastern Plaguelands, Winterspring, Silithus, Scholomance, or Stratholme.
---
I'm actually kind of sad that I probably won't get to quest in Winterspring at all, which I have some strong nostalgia for,
---
because I feel like I need to do BRD and the other dungeons now, so that I don't still have Maraudon / Sunken Temple gear at 60.
---
&gt; I got all the quests done in Westfall and now I'm in Redridge trying to finish it, but mobs are basically shitting on me.  
---
Go to Loch Modan and do quest there.  
---
There's one trick that game doesn't properly explain - you will fall behind level curve, if you only do quests in one location without grinding.  
---
I did all quests in Westfall and was level 16 - barely enough to do starting quests in Redridge.  
---
There's three solutions for this - one is to find nice spot with fast respawn of mobs that you could quickly kill, and get level or two there. Or move to another 10-20 location (like Darkshore or Loch Modan) and play there.  
---
Or run Dead Mines 2-3 times, it will give you exp and some item upgrades.
---
For you - go to Stormwind, pick up quest "Delivery to Stormspike" and go to Ironforge, walk outside and run to Loch Modan.  
---
With your level 20 you may skip some gray quests and start with 15+ quests at south part of location.  
---
Or group-up in Redrige with 4 other players, do all elite quests and move to Duskwood.  
---
P.S. Remember - each location have more like "tiers" of quests. Like Redridge have 15-16 at the south-west, then there 18-19 at the north and 20+ at the east part.  
---
You want to do 15-16, then go to another location and also do 15-16 quests there, get level 18, return to Redridge, do 18-19, go to another location, do 18-19 there, return to Redridge :)
---
how hard was it?
---
Damn
---
A perfect landing on these mental gymnastics. 5/7.
---
happens so often, even with green mobs. *miss *parry *block *dodge
---
The worst as warrior, is when he dodges, so you go for overpower, and it misses ...
---
Okay I’ll keep that in mind thanks for the tip
---
Phase 2 adds nothing to raiding. And phase 3, if a guild wants to progress to BWL - they need loot from MC and Ony.
---
What kinda neat stuff could a level 60 rogue-druid duo do in instances? Asking for me and a friend?

standing is the number one killer in Azeroth
---
They are actually great tanks and healers if played correctly. People love me as a tank over warriors. Feral dps can be good if you understand shape shifting. I did MC as feral two days ago with all tank gear and was consistently top 15 dps. 
---
I am not sure if you are being a troll or not but I hate when people drag druids through the mud. I think the true problem is the skill gap for druids is higher than most classes and this becomes really clear when pvp happens. So most people just some it up to the class being bad when really it is they that are the baddies. Or maybe I’m just being a sensitive baby because I feel ATTACKED. 
---
&lt;3
---
thicc
---
Halfway to 54 and I've almost ever pre-BiS in BRD.
---
Also gotten halfway with the Onyxia attunement.
---
All in all I'm doing fairly well, I'd say
---
BWL tier catch up gear from a quest? You think we need that when doing MC and Ony?
---
Alright good advice. Sometimes need to be reminded to focus on what I have and stop looking at what others have
---
or pummel when you get it, you don't need to swap into shield which often prevents you from casting shield bash in time anyway, and solo-ing / leveling all the time with a shield on is just a pain in the ass anyway, i'd rather sometimes die to a caster than this.
---
Overabundance of rogues? As far as I've seen (from census, before they disabled it) they were lowest played class just about tied with druids.
---
Now thats sad...easy 20gold, up to 300 400 in a few months
---
All this in a situation where you just charged into a group and the dps began shooting way too soon before you even had a change to accumulate threat, it happens ALL The time. Always makes me shake my head in disappointment, everyone is so accustomed to zoomzoom gottago fast gameplay and Classic just isn't like that.
---
Don't all classes have costs when they do their job correctly?  Rogues add up a lot of cost when you factor in 24/7 poisons, thistle tea during make or break moments, and reagants for blind/vanish.
---
Neither, both are trash. I want classic+.
---
Yeah I went into molten core fully expecting it to be pretty fucking easy, but honestly it wasn't even easy it was just like it wasnt even there. Makes LFR look like mythic by comparison
---
They'd all be ricidulous tbh. All of them. 
---
Imagine trying to fight a hunter who has all of his survival points AS WELL AS his marksmanship and pet on steroids. Good luck catching him while he wing clips you, scatter shots you, traps you and stuns you with conc shot while his enraged pet who is immune to CC harasses you
---
hahaha :D
---
some1 with weak auras expertise can tell me how to make certain auras available only to a certain character? I made a rage bar for my warrior but it's also showing on my rogue's UI, also would love to know how to show stances (plan on putting beneath it, haven't quite figured that one out yet as well).
---
Since lifetaping is more efficent to get mana it should be done. I think a healer can handle throwing a hot on a lock, their job is to keep the group up afterall. If a healer makes a scene and doesn't want to heal a lock, the dungeon will take longer because of less dps/uptime not just from the lock, but the whole group.
---
But if a healer can't be bothered to heal, locks can have good options better than drinking+eating at 50% HP.
---
1. First Aid/Cannibalize.
---
2. Demon Armor, Healthstones and Drain Life helps but if you have to drain life you aren't spamming shadowbolts so less dps=longer dungeon for everyone.
---
Also TBC is garbage.
---
Why would it be changed? ZF farm makes just as much. Hunter tribute farm makes more.
---
Lol I have work in 3.5 hours. Stayed up from 6pm-3am playing. Will likely sleep all day tomorrow after work or come home early
---
As far as DPS goes, absolutely, I've had no issues topping DPS in dungeons
---
Dude you still spend hundreds of gold on the quest line and the time it takes you could prob farm the money. Especially with DM out that’s usually every classes best solo farm spot.
---
Yes but that's because people are idiots that don't realize there have always been catch-up mechanics in this game ever since 1.4 or so. It's a core design feature of the game.
---
The only problem is when they go overboard with them (artifact power gating and whatnot).

Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you’re unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don’ts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE and 1 City. Days are finalized to be Mondays and Tuesdays, 5-8 PM PST. If you cannot commit to those times, we have a second raid roster on Saturday and Sunday 5-8PM PST. However, for both rosters we have a dedicated wPvP day on Thursday 5-8PM PST. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can’t roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for wPvP attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit
---
* A friendly tight-knit group who share a common interest in classic and other games
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won’t stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who’s friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla – you’re welcome, and you’re wanted.

That I cant tell, but Im more interested in the number of people that are actually gonna reach lvl 60. People om Reddit complain about people speeding through the lvl process and getting burnt out, but I am really interested in seeing the numbers Of people that have started lvling and the people that actually finished.

I am also quite interested in seeing the numbers of people that have completed each of the end game dungeons so far at the level range 50-60, because the whole discussion boils down to one side not having reached 60 yet complaining that blizzard is moving to fast because they dont have the time to play, and the other side where people have more time to play and already have aqquired their bis gear etc. Personally I dont think that the people that havent reached lvl 60 yet will: A, spam dungeons to get their bis gear anyway because it takes time and dedication, which they obviously lack, and B, Even reach lvl 60. And if we’re gonna have to wait another 3-4 months for them to get their bis gear and their rate, we’re not gonna see the next phase before 1 quarter of 2020.
---
The original comment within this thread is referring to griefing Locks because they're not drinking though, that's the point I was addressing.
---
I completely agree that Warlocks who are too tap happy should be left to their own devices and learn from their mistakes, that's a good learning curve.
---
The real problem with Warlocks in dungeons is that they don't voice their actions to the healer which is important, I always state that I will be dropping to 30%-40% health and that I don't need healing but if you want to pop low mana heals on me during combat that would make things smoother.
---
Why do you need to *keep up*? Pride? Realistically, if you have those items by the release of the next raid tier, you should be good. And that is by no means an unreasonable grind. And even then, it's BWL.
---
Damn it... now I can't wait until the absolute last minute to finish my extended tax returns
---
I'll listen to a yutube summary podcast about next expansion story
---
Then I'll fire up Classic+ and get to grinding a few elementals with the rest of the bois
---
DM gear won't have a significant impact on the "MC experience", it's just gonna be slightly easier than it already is (which won't change much).
---
Its all about the speed. And weaving Aimed + auto attacks. Once you have Xbow from chromagg, you are pretty much BiS up to Kel´Thuzad. Its all about missing autos while casting aimed.
---
yea but a skinning knife or bs hammer with +30 sp is bis until mageblade.
---
Definitely. I started playing wow when I was a kid, like 9. My character only got to the low 30s, but I guarantee I had just as much if not more fun than any min/maxed top tier raider.
---
Commenting this when Ali opened as higher levels and as 2v1... You got to see the hypocrisy r

Okay.

Yep. Noted.

I didn't know at the time that people actually valued pets (I was noob mindset all the way to my first 60. I didn't even know people paid for cooking or fishing mats. I never even considered raising cooking VIA fishing). After I found out, your username definitely applied there.

Something with the size of my screen and the native resolution and my eyesight made elvui unreadable. I know tuk is just the stripped down version, but if I can match his settings it looks like it'll work for me

wonderful thanks for the help :)

Been using bite for 25 days now, wow does it make a difference!
---
Get yo spell hit up boy. Resists dont have to happen... For the most part at least in pvp
---
So many instances are just a pain without a mage for a miriad of reasons. Healers &amp; dd not drinking after every group because water is not free, decurse, ranged interrupt, frostnova, a large variety of instant aoe, sheep just to name a few. I have done strat without a mage. Never again.
---
Commenting this when Ali opened as higher levels and 2v1.... U can see the hypocrisy r?
---
Gotcha. I picked darn because it's not as big as if and sw (org and uc), it's the home of druids, and the portal/teleport spells are 10 levels higher than the other two.
---
Either way, never having been to tb is ridic

Dot-dot-dot-dot-fear, on to the next mob. *Laughs in warlock*
---
DM was released 4 months after MC. There were absolutely MC runs before DM was released.
---
I wonder how many of these posters actually even play classic lol
---
Back in the day i started playing at release. Dinged 60 right before the release of zul'gurub. 
---
Still had tons of fun even if i was waaaaay behind the curve. There was always new players coming in.
---
You can end up without quests if you don't complete green quests and just focus on yellow. People who rush quests to level faster (thus focusing only on yellow for higher XP yield) would find themselves lacking in overall quests as the green quests turn to grey. Long story short, as long as you also do green quests and not overly rush, you should be fine.

Itemization at 1.12 is very different from 1.0-1.10.
---
We’re playing the game as intended rather than the game that was actually out.
---
Most issues people have with this game can be solved with this statement.
---
Smol dik
---
he isnt talking about dungeons, hes talking about when you hearth to kargath and on the way to the flight master 3 people open trade without saying anything (although i still give them water if they place money in the trade like a good vending machine would)
---
Its like taking a taxi in foreign county
---
I see, but aint that the same with ores in a dungeon? U wouldnt be able to get to them without the group? But still we don’t demand to roll for the ores, if we didnt pick up mining.
---
You should really have made it your first order of action as a 60 to ride further in and go down in a blaze of glory! :)
---
Actually, it wouldn't be that unless all the epics on the loot table have exactly the same chance of dropping. Which is unlikely. And since there's certainly a limit in terms of items possibly dropped by a single mob, the events "get item(A)" and "get item(B)" are not independant anyway, so you can't just multiply the probabilities.
---
That being said, despite what the post says, I don't think two Epics can drop from the same single mob (maybe they dropped from a single pull ? You can see the Pala greeded something in between the two items appear as loot in the chat).
---
WTF did you do to that mage at around 3:65 that made them incapacitated?  Is that another engineering device?
---
I might have to pick up engineering if so.
---
You could put `/equip Carrot on a Stick` into a macro (before `/use &lt;mount name&gt;`). For dismounting it's not so easy because you can dismount in many different ways and you'd have to macro all of them. An addon can help here, I doubt one already exists but who knows.
---
You would be surprised just how few warlocks use drain health. Most locks I've grouped up with, just wait there for me to heal them each time.
---
The perfect world
---
Stop using any Chinese product.  Bet you wont.
---
If you have a spell interrupt ability they are a lot easier than the other mobs. Don't pull two though :)
---
While this is true, me experience is when the tank pull before I and the other mana classes get back our only thing we need to not be useful is that it increases the wipe rate and the time as a whole. This making us all have to repair.
---
When I log in I find some mage in org to sell me 120 of them for 1g and we both leave happy
---
You worry to much
---
Also the swim speed belt
---
You're right, it's not that serious and it's not a big deal. One is just better in every tangible way. So why care so much to back and forth with me about it?
---
Really reddit we were so close!
---
Does Dire Maul releasing influence protection warriors pre raid bis list, for example Satyr's Bow could be a replacement for Blackrow with it having a 15% drop rate versus Blackrows 6%. Are there any other items that could perhaps replace some items on the current bis list. Dreadguard's Protecter vs Draconian Deflector etc.
---
This is sorta aggravating.
---
2 is included in 2+, correct?
---
So, I'm correcting part of your statement and expanding on why I think a correction is in order. 
---
I'm getting this feeling you're not really taking the time to read what is written, or perhaps I'm incoherent.
---
Either way - back to square two:
---
If it works for you, praise be! I inhabit a different universe it seems.
---
Well chain lightning and fire totem combined with slow magma totem..ive seen videos of it but i think its on pservers so dont know
---
I dinged 40 and sold org and UC ports till I had my gold
---
I wish they would release the PvP systems instead. That gives players something to do without actually interfering with people getting gear. My classic WoW experience included doing battlegrounds while leveling up.
---
I still havent figured out how to disable this shit, so annoying
---
I'm not sure what the equal is for Alliance but the place closest to BRM with a hearthstone location is a very good place to sell portals as Horde, as many non-mages have their HS there and then want to get to a city. For Horde that place is Kargath, but as I said I'm not sure if Alliance has a similar spot.
---
I Have never played wow, i wanna start now with classic, is it too late to start now? also what class should i make? i can play about 2 hours per day and all day long on sunday. the only other mmorpg i have played is Lineage 2, that game is my life, the class i liked the most was the gladiator, a dual sword heavy armor dps, but it requiered the most farming, so i guess i need something more casual here, maybe a buffer? any tips are welcome, also cool zones i should check
---
Perfect, thank you :)
---
Tried again, but I missed.
---
I used https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet but you can also use https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2091/magic-dust which is a consumable that you can just farm, no professions required.
---
Tab+Sunder+Tab+Sunder+Tab ...
---
Having druid/warlock cast Thorns on you may help. Or pala with Retribution aura.  
---
Your shouts also generate threat, based on amount of people buffed. So Battle Shout that buffed all 5 players in party will create some amount of threat on every mob, enough to keep them from running to heal instantly)  
---
P.S. Also person who pulled mobs generate "basic" threat on whole pulled pack. So don't allow your DPS to pull)
---
Thanks, all the players he tried reported him.. I think!
---
Hahaha
---
Warlock's get 2-3 pieces added to their PRE-RAID BiS, and 2 of those same ones to raid BiS...it's nice but MC and Ony along with already existing world drops and tailoring patterns are still giving you 14/16 slots of gear.
---
Amplifying Cloak and Sublime Wristguards are the two exception pieces.
---
Druids are a must have for WSG. Combined with a paladin that is the ultimate flag carrying combo.
---
People here don’t know how to warrior.
---
Well done.

I leveled from 28-40 by only tanking SM.  Finished up by hitting 40 with a few other players in Cath last night.

The rule reads "Blizzard can do whatever the fuck they want with you if they deem it necessary". The existance of such clause in tournament ruleset is a separate topic. The problem at hand is how this clause was used in practice.
---
A WHOOLLEEE NEEEWWW WWOOORRLLLDDD
---
Oh, are u sure? Can warlock solo the endboss form DM:N ? With Voidwalker or how exactly?
---
Meh, /ignore and move on
---
Jesus, I only started a warrior *this morning* and know this to be true.
---
Again, nobody has the hard data. It's a general impression, and I'm not touting it as anything but.
---
Paladins are actually very effective at multi target healing. Basically its just ebdless spamming flash of light on random targets. 
---
Shingle target healing can actually be a bit of a struggle for paladins because holy light is rough on mana efficiency.
---
There is a tab action skill bar ( name might be wrong) once you hit escape. There you can set more
---
If they cater to the people that are already running out of things to do in classic, we will fall in the same trap of retail. Come on, the game has been out for a month.
---
 If they drop TBC the hardcore crowd will smash through it in another month of playing. Give it a year or so and what? We are back in BFA?
---
People need to chill or go run mythic dungeons and raids in retail if all they care about is endgame progression.
---
So I have been druid taking, never played druid before.   Enrage is key.  Before the fight, then go in as it ends.  While the fight is happening, stop using abilities and let the rage build for the next fight.  
---
And don't ever think you can tank 5 green dragons for an overzealous mage.
---
ideal base stats are: Armor, Agi, stam and str in that order

Paying 1g for a trade of water is a very good deal as you will go through a stack of the stuff in no time and then you're already better off than with vendor water. Seriously I go through a stack of water in like 30 minutes as a mage myself, in dungeons it's even faster although you will probably get free water from the groups mage if you have one there.
---
Yeah it's mostly the dismounting that's tricky.
---
I'll equip my riding boots and then an hour passes and I'll realize I never switched back to my actual boots. Same with the trinkets.
---
I see what you mean, but apart from the rng-element in the game. In hindsight i always think of something to improve. and ofc in dungeons you're in a group and external cause is more likely to happen. But even so, good plays from you can save the situation from other peoples fuckups.
---
Literally no one gives a fuck
---
I don’t have the source, but Ion said in an interview from somewhere that they wanted phase one to be short. Like a couple of months short. When dire maul is released we will be 7 weeks into its life cycle. For EU realms that’s 4 weeks longer than they had pre-DM in vanilla. 
---
This isn’t even the end of phase one, and they’ve also stated that the rest of phase two is still end of year-ish. 
---
How long were folk expecting to not have dire maul? I was expecting about 10 weeks but at the end of the day I don’t really care that much. (I’m not yet level 60, for what it’s worth).
---
So you’re a failure at life working probably in retail that has 0 hobbies or interests outside of a useless one.
---
Alright :) 
---
Good responses neckbeards. You sum my point up nicely.
---
I'm (warlock) duo leveling with my shaman buddy. We are both lvl 21 now and having (mostly) a blast in the limited time we can play.
---
We still want to get the max out of our characters. Now i didn't spend a skillpoint yet beyond instant corruption.
---
I read about so many ways to skill a warlock.. i dunno what's best for me now, since most of the time we pull 1-2 mobs and my dots don't tick all the way, so it's mostly my wanding shit down.
---
Any suggestions?
---
Boy howdy
---
I was considering resubbing, but I won't be after reading this.
---
Well done Blizz. And in a few months you'll say it's because "people got bored"
---
It's not an random idea ... every warr that knows what they are doing is using this strat. As I said, it's done in around 2 or 3 seconds, if you can't figure out how, maybe this class is too hard for you.
---
Just go shadowmeld fam
---
Once all the phases are released, I hope they just leave the servers as-is for years so we can complete all the content at our own pace.
---
Post was cleared with mods because
---
1) It's related to WoW: Classic in that it reflects the behavior and intents of the parent company Activision/Blizzard, and
---
5) Even though the content of the article focuses on the real world politics involved with their decision to punish Blitzchung, I believe my post is being interpreted by mods as a place to discuss the actions taken by Activision/Blizzard and not purely for the sake of political/religious pontification.
---
Ah yes, the old massive exaggeration technique. 
---
While I don't agree with harassing someone you are basically saying these people shouldn't be called out for their shitty behaviour. How about the people who know now that questing/dungeoning with this guy could a problem and thus can form their own opinion on whether or not to group with them based on past actions?

We're giving Sulfuras to our Moonkin. Thunderfury we have a pecking order, but Sulfuras is a dkp roll, and he hasn't spent any dkp whatsoever yet, and is planning to dump it on the drop.
---
Rogue ui that shows energy tics? The luna energy bars are very choppy...
---
Tailoring is only useful for Truefaith and mooncloth cooldown. You could also craft bags but eh, that's hardly worth a profession slot. The cooldown itself is very little profits unless you barely play at all (making it good for an alt), otherwise you could make the chest and drop the profession. It's pretty cheap to level so that's not a terrible idea (though runecloth prices have been rising significantly on my server lately).
---
I'd love some input on a priest build! Soon Ill be 60 and i want a healing build that will function well in both in PvP and PvE (raiding aswell as 5-man dungeons).
---
So far i am leaning towards this 21/30/0 build  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusV0oZbxtsc0Vx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusV0oZbxtsc0Vx).  Aside from any general inputs my direct questions are:
---
1. Where should i put my stray point in holy? I cant decide between Spell Warding/Blessed Recovery/Improved Renew
---
2. I do kinda like the idea of spirit of redemption in PvP, but is it worth it? and if so, should i sacrifice a point from Spiritual Guidance or Spiritual Healing?
---
Thanks in advance
---
TIL, didn't know that.
---
dont forget the two autoattacks in that timeframe - one get dodged the other misses.
---
Do they need other classes for their shenanigans? In SM I almost never saw a mage, because as a shaman you don't fit into the meme spellcleave group lineup, so all mages (and lots of locks/priests) were doing their thing which left lots of melees and hunters to goup with.
---
Just have fun mate. Levelling a new character is so much better with a gold from a main, and you aren't behind in anything. There will be groups clearing MC the 12 months.
---
Sounds like a new Iphone user is born :P
---
yes, 2 is included in 2+. 1-2 is not included in 2+ because you dont use swipe on 1 target unless dumping rage so i have no idea why you mention 1-2 target scenario.
---
i agree, this discussion is annoying. 
---
in my universe swipe is THE best spell for tanking dungeons and every competent bear i have met agrees with me, so i don't know where you come from
---
Yes, but I don't think you want the tank to sit down and drink after every pull do you?
---
Is there a place I can find good talent builds for classes that aren't orientated towards raids?
---
I'm guessing that the builds would be similar anyway, as I guess what's good in a raid is good in the world...
---
Just wondering if there were any builds that people have come across that are aimed at;
---
- Purely solo
---
- 2+ groups in the world, so like 2 players leveling together
---
- Dungeon content
---
I'm personally not interested in raids, I did them before and it was all good and whatnot...my aspirations this time round are probably going to be aimed at 5 person dungeon content (at a push).
---
So with that in mind, is there a difference to the builds? Does it matter?
---
the original version was kind of p2w and they are supposedly releasing a new version with a different monetization with mostly cosmetics. some people really enjoy the pvp in that game.
---
Yes, agi provides both threat and avoidance, wheres strength just provides AP
---
Ive thought about this question for years. I think the hybrid tax would grow even more with unlimited talent points. A druid with everu talent maxed couldnt use them all at once in any situation becuase you wont be geared to tank and heal at the same time.
---
Whereas a rogue with all 3 dps trees maxxed out would just fucking shred anything and the druid wouldnt have three tank or heal trees to max out to make up that ground. 
---
Shamand for example would gear spell power to utilize two of their trees but those enhancement talents wouldnt be useful.
---
A warlock with all three trees could utilize all three at once and just demolish anything, same for hunter.
---
Levelling at your own pace is what make/made it fun
---
The progression the satisfaction of achieving something you’ve spent hours working towards is what makes it great.
---
That’s what missing from retail wow
---
I've not done it, only seen video's. But it's basically the same as hunter. Void tanks the other boss separately. And lock just Dots and kites with jumping on and of that ledge, which causes King to keep pathing around up to the ledge and of the ledge
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
Adding "/s" ruins any comment for me..
---
`/equip Carrot on a Stick`
---
`/use &lt;mount name&gt;`
---
Then a seperate macro for dismounting
---
`/equip &lt;normal trinket&gt;`
---
I'm not 100% certain this will work, but it's my best guess. I have my mount bound to ctrl+7 and would then probably bind my dismount macro to shift+7 if I were to do something like this. Maybe it's possible to make the macro check if Carrot on a Stick is equipped, if not, equip it, and if it is, equip another trinket? Hopefully someone can shed some light on this.
---
Everything will always be ran for the entire duration of Classic. People join the game, people reroll, people make alts.
---
Dire Maul removes the need for *some* items from specific dungeons but there will always be people running those dungeons.
---
Hey man, you’re definitely in the right here. Other skinners sure, rolling between them is the right thing to do, since no one could get to beast and down it solo. 
---
Non skinners wanting to roll is unfair / greedy.
---
Yes it does?
---
Supply and demand. On my server there's a fuckton of healers but a lot less tanks, so tanks are getting paid for runs sometimes.
---
I think you should be proud to be honest, level 37 is quite a few hours invested, you can check played time for your character by typing /played in game, but it does include any time you spend logged in and away from your computer. It's cool that you're sticking around after than many hours. WoW was so ahead of it's time when it released and we'll designed, that's why it's so easy to enjoy it so many years later.
---
Costs too much if you\`re not leveling an alt.
---
You can use the EZ-Throw ones.
---
It seems that Amplifying Cloak and Sublime Wristguards are the only two.
---
People are reacting to this just like they were to layering and every other  doom and gloom thing.  Just waiting for people to start predicting Naxx by Summer 2020.  This won't really affect anyone in gear-quality wise because everything is already pretty easy with the itemized gear we have.  The most important parts of DM are the epic mounts for pallys/locks and the mage water.  Everything else is just letting you kill that MC boss in 45secs instead of 47.
---
The set bonus (crit)needs tailoring, not the set itself
---
You could macro /equip your normal gear into some abilities you use when dismounting, ofc you can't use that in combat so sometimes you will be fighting with your carrot on but eventually it should switch back. However, you'd also need to remember to update the macros every time you get an upgrade, otherwise you'd keep switching to your old trinkets if you even have them on you.
---
Well judging from your comment, some are not sensible :)
---
No. I tried that. Had put some shadowgems on AH, then later I realized I needed one on my alt for enchanting. Tried buying my own shadowgems but was not allowed to do so
---
You should reroll horde. You can also kill your own faction by buffing them when they jump off the zeppelin.
---
I can't resist it either.
---
You may have been layered without realizing it. I got 6 kills and lost the tag 4 more times and had a friend going for it when I couldn't be there for about 5 spawns and everytime it fit into the 32-48 hour respawn window.
---
Addiction is a disease.
---
and they will keep doing it if you black out their names
---
The cloak isn't available yet, it will be soon but people will likely charge a crazy fee for it for some time (it's also leatherworking, not tailoring).
---
How do you maintain aoe threat?  I've been having trouble.  For example, if you grab a group of 5, what do you need to do for a mage to be safe to start casting aoe?
---
Fellow shamans, I feel like I hit a wall post 40. What type of spec/gearing/playstyle do you recommend to get over the hump?
---
As a "resto" shaman (I'm elemental with healing gear, don't tell), I used over 7 stacks of lvl 45 mage water in a BRD full quest clear the other night.  Luckily my brother was the mage so I didn't feel bad about asking for a full trade window of water twice.
---
In case of female orc they are not hunchbacks so if you hate that on males they are the way to go.
---
Probably because it breaks the rules because it has literally nothing to do with the game
---
People who want to collect all of the recipes I suppose. 
---
Although It may be rare the item it creates isn't amazing
---
I ran LBRS starting at 56 with my friends.  Sure a random group won't want you if you aren't 60, but I can't blame them for taking someone potentially raid geared over some random guy that's not even 60.
---
There is always a miss chance, even if hit caped. That's when I get angry ;)
---
Wait, people don't know this? Weird.
---
I knew that :). But it was more being able to have two items that's essentially BiS at lvl 57 is pretty well prepared imo.

.....how in the hell do you figure that? Phase 6 is probably going to launch around Jul-Aug of 2021...Raid Phases are going to last much longer than this...this isn't even Phase 2...it's just Phase 1.5...it's just Dire Maul.
---
So how do you justify playing this game yourself? or any game at all?  are you struggling to keep playing casually or just indulging and being fine with it?
---
Personally I play casually but even justifying playing is sometimes a struggle and i think this line : "The moment you start playing video games is the moment your life freezes but time moves forward, literally nothing physical is gained. " covers my personal doubts pretty well. My personal justification is that you can't and don't have to be productive 24/7 and there should be time for fun and relaxation. Still at the same time you could read a book for relaxation and maybe learn something/ get some artificial life experience.

I had a guy trade me one gold and then ask me for a port about 30 seconds later. I told him I didn't train portals yet. He flipped out then I made him a portal
---
Well,
---
more competition = lower prices.
---
lower prices = less profit
---
less profit = less competition
---
Then they find a balance.
---
I make my gold by buying/selling on the AH. If I see a great dea (30% off+) l I'm buying it and reselling it straight away. I'm happy to undercut by 5-10% for a quick sale to get my capital back with a return on investment for future trading.
---
Someone else can deal with the hassle of squeezing that last 5/10% out of the item, while fighting the other competition.

Buddy of mine respecced to Ele and was quite happy with the outcome.
---
The true Vanilla experience, right in your face!
---
Finally got both dals completed last night. Only 20 runs or so
---
I just watch YouTube in popout player ontop of the game so I don't get bored while grinding.

January is way to late imo. I was honestly thinking they'd do December

This whole exchange made my morning. I love it!

#THE MASTER PLAN
---
* join RP server, Alliance side
---
* acquire profession to craft armours
---
* farm crafting plans for low-level sexy clothes
---
* craft a bunch
---
* hand them out for free to random female toons
---
* in Goldshire
---
There's nothing else tailoring can make that you could profit from. Except bags but as I said I don't think that's enough revenue for a profession slot. For some reason they completely neglected the profession in classic and didn't add any rare recipes you could profit from. It's only good for personal use, and for priests you don't need to keep it after getting your truefaith. Mages and warlocks will want to keep it for Bloodvine set, though.
---
You *think* it was handled but you were lied to.
---
It was never going to take that long, it was originally slated for "before the end of the year" and we all knew this.
---
'Mama, mama! I'M ON THE TV!'
---
Well its very annoying when you dont have a mage in a group and water costs 40s a stack.  
---
Im sitting here drinking during downtime and the lock is just life tapping to 10% which makes me drink more.  All because they are too cheap to buy their own water.
---
Nope, playing Hunter and loving it. I did have small doubts about playing Rogue but I've decided to make that my alt.
---
If it's an upgrade, I have never not rolled need. You genuinely NEED the item. If it's for an off spec, I'll generally ask "mind if I need?", just to be polite.
---
Yep.
---
I'm happy for a quick sale.
---
Someone else can fight the 1c undercutters while constantly relisting.
---
Redoubt cloak rather than stoneskin gargoyle cape
---
Fel hardened bracers rather than runed golem shackles
---
Hey Blizzard can you fix the dozens and dozens of bugs maybe?
---
Blizzard: here's fire maul
---
Right click on the Text "LookingForGroup"
---
Move to new window.
---
As a tank, LFG is always open in a tab, and I occasionally check it to see if something is close to my level.
---
Too soon Executus.
---
Probably didn't want someone to roll in competition for something. In Vanilla (as a Rogue), I'd have every key so I could start the groups and I'd limit invites based on what I needed. I wouldn't take it personally.
---
Start your own groups and spam the heck out of /who [modifier].
---
If you play and learn a class you quickly figure out why a certain spec does not work in raids. It might be pure dps problems, taking up too many dot slots, mana struggle in long fights etc. Most specs and even hybrids are viable in pvp and 5man / solo content
---
c'mon! i love when i click slam by mistake and he just stands there shaking mad
---
I just keep one bleach on me for these situations
---
Skinning knife had higher DPS than the weapon I had, so I did the same.
---
Omg I never played a S.Priest in classic till now. Holy shit am i melting faces. Group needs a healer? well hop on out of shadow form and im a "holy" priest as far as they know.
---
To be fair, I want the group to pull while I'm drinking. By the time I'm done the tank has decent aggro or the pack is dead. If the latter, I have mana for the next and didn't have to drink again.

Region EU - Faction Horde - Server Type PVP

[H] Razorgore - &lt;Vanguard&gt;
---
Vanguard are a semi-hardcore guild on Razorgore EU.  We are primarily made up of English, Dutch and Belgian players, but everyone speaks English in chat and raid.  We raid twice a week on Wednesday (7:30pm CEST) and Sunday (7pm CEST) and are currently 9/10 MC (Raggy will drop this week) with Ony on farm.
---
We are currently seeking a couple of extra bodies to round out our raid team and balance it correctly. We are particularly interested in:
---
1 x Resto Druid 
---
1 x Holy/Disc Priest 
---
1-2 x Warlocks  
---
1 x Mage
---
Loot is determined by a loot council of officers and class leads.  Our raids are pretty relaxed until it comes time to focus-up and our raid leaders are experienced and knowledgeable. Use of consumables on progression in required, but for farm content we are more relaxed. We expect all raiders to sign up for raids on our website and be able to join our discord channel (you dont have to speak, just listen).
---
If you are interested in joining us and becoming a part of Vanguard, please submit an application at http://vanguard-razorgore.shivtr.com/
---
As far as I can read, bags aren't implemented before Phase 2 or later (soul bags, herb etc). But you do make a good point.
---
"Attaches a permanent scope to a bow or gun that increases **its** chance to hit by 3%."
---
Of course it doesn't affect melee.
---
It's odd; what you have in Arms is good for 5 man's (I have this as I can bank rage at the end of a fight and have it for the next pull) but with noting in Fury your TPS will take a hit and the 40 points in Protection seems to be aimed at full mitigation. I would focus for more of an MT, OT or 5 man spec; most of which would want a little in the fury tree because TPS is extremely important the way the game is played currently.
---
You're a fucking idiot, but that was proven with your previous comment. It's an apt analogy, you just don't like that you had to have it explained slowly to you
---
This is so cool! Didnt know that.
---
So I'm level 41 and have 46 gold. I'm not sure where I went wrong. I haven't purchased most of my skills, I only bought a few 8 slot bags on the AH. I have two gathering professions. 
---
Should I just continue to quest? I'm a Shaman so ghost wolf helps a lot, but I admit it's pretty discouraging.
---
Not enaf enah gee
---
I have 5 of my factions available classes at level 30 or higher. I hate my life. Still can't settle on a main. 
---
It seems there are major pros and cons for every class/race combo. 
---
Rogue, Mage, Warrior and priest seem stupidly overpopulated..  but the reason for that is they're good classes in both pve and pvp. 
---
Druids are pointless unless you wanna heal.. or are they? Nobody seems to care what spec you're playing in raids because they're a lot easier these days. 
---
My mind is back and forth like this on every class. 
---
The smart thing to do is just play what you enjoy, but it's hard when everyone that's been warped by retail is like 'PLAY META SPECS'...
---
No, you won't make gold from it. On my server raid buff food that you can fish sells for \~15s per fish. So an hour of fishing will yield less than an hour of running through a dungeon.
---
As with all Classic professions: do them because you like them, not because you feel you must do them.
---
lmao this keeps happening to me in raids
---
I swear molten giants just don’t give a fuck about taunts
---
Been there, done that. Then they kill everyone and you have to leave because you didnt save the NPCs.
---
I fired again and then i missed
---
I'm part of the crowd who leveled to 60 in under 2 weeks and have been playing since... and even I think this is waaaay too soon....
---
You fucking spacker.
---
why the hell would it be too late ? It's not a race competition, there are plenty of players everywhere
---
When it comes to pve i dont think thats necessarilly true. At least not for all classes. For instance mage. You would have your most efficient spells in your rotation and it would make most of your talents worthless. For instance fire mages are the best choice for later raids. How many talents from the frost spec would be actually useful to increase the dps? Not many is my guess.
---
Druid i think would be pretty strong in pvp. Although probably not as good as some of the others. The gameplay of druid us already going in and out of form many times and it would make you better in all forms. But i think youre right about shamans.
---
Had a mage try to port out after winning the roll.  Come on man, Rend is like 10 yards away...
---
What class are you? 5 person dungeon builds are probably not too different from raid specs. Icy veins, wow head, you can generally Google "classic xxwhateverclassyouarexx talent guide" and find what you're looking for.

2h enhancement the whole time so far and I’ve loved it, I’m 37. Considering switching to elemental around 45.
---
If you get the other person to leave, the rest of your time will be well spent.
---
Think of it as an investment.
---
Unless you're speced into the drain tank build it's a resource loss,
---
DM released less than a month after release. I stand by what I said.
---
The release here is even longer than it was for Europe back then; you are all overreacting.

Female orcs get all the racials of orcs and arnt hunchback

They look the best in gear once you get a helmet similar to human skeleton

No, that can actually be ironfoe I think

Vendor the blues, and carry a rogue through and sell the blackstone ring for like 20g when it drops.
---
If you're a herbalist you get a steady stream of ghost mushrooms which are decent as well.
---
Oui,
---
That's what I'm looking for.
---
Some insight into what 'good' specs would be outside of raids.
---
Like a...I don't know...28/0/23 for an ele/resto shaman.
---
More benefit than someone who isn't in our guild.
---
Fuckin whoosh
---
Can we have a prooflink? Kinda banned in google
---
That's what I thought. A snide comment made me second guess myself and ponder whether I was a ninja. I was getting lucky on a lot of rolls in that instance so that may have been part of it. Thanks!
---
"druids are bad tanks because warriors will outscale them in a year"
---
Send the gold to your bank alt and let it sell it for you?
---
I think ultimately you’ve got to ask yourself the question: “are I going to play more?”
---
If you are busy and can only play a few hours a week then MC was/is always going to be an impossible dream. Maybe you’ll do a PuG once or twice but ultimately your play time isn’t high enough right now. I’d focus on what you can achieve with your current playtime and target more realistic goals. If those goals aren’t sounding like what you want then I’d probably unsub. 
---
For example, I am only able to play 10-15 hours a week, mainly before work. Very sporadically, and may need to stop playing suddenly. Therefore, instances/raids will only be possible when I have a day/half day to myself. So I am just focusing on levelling through questing (42, 3.5 days played) and then when I have a block of time to myself I’ll go instance/raid. But I am currently on the fence as to whether this is worth £9.99/month. As an aside if they want this game to last years they are going to need to drop that for players who have literally no interest in retail. Like my friend (who got my hooked 15 years ago and stopped 14 years ago) said “they are charging the same price for a 15 year old game with no new content?!”.
---
Not sure why that’s so hard to believe.
---
Wife has endo ... what a d comment in your part
---
My pserver guild had a skinning knife with +30 spellpower that got passed around quite a bit
---
Character Notes works fine for classic. Been using it for a while without any bug.
---
Ah you're right my bad.
---
Thats cause its easy to get. Drops off brd
---
On Tauren it hs actually. Female and male has a different hit box leeway afaik
---
The drop rate on these is absurd now. I've seen one drop too.
---
Never too late, friend! I'm not familiar with lineage 2, but dual wielding you'd enjoy a rogue or a warrior. Rogues have stealth and are very strong single target damage. Warriors are bloodthirsty aggressors that can dual wield, use a 2 handed weapon, or use a shield and a weapon. Both are extremely rewarding once you get to a certain level, I've heard they can be hard to level in the early stages. Do you want alliance or horde?
---
Layers are a function of the population now, but once they are all flattened they won't be. We will have the same population on one layer, one set of resources, and it will effect the economy of the servers.
---
Makes my goal of every class at 30+ look a bit redundant.
---
Haha and you cherry picked the only good example! I guess it makes sense to delay the whole thing for everyone because of one overpowered item for one class so that by the time they do release they are even more worthless (aside from the flask again).
---
i feel like 90% of tanks feel like special snowflakes that the whole game revolves around.  i would never give money to a tank for doing his job. no one is paying healers. no one is paying dps.  grow a pair and do ur job. end of story
---
Wise words, my friend, wise words. Take my upvote.
---
Nice! Great answer!
---
If we are in a dungeon/raid with someone they are entitled to your utility defacto.
---
Level 29? When did you start playing?
---
I mean you’re an adult with children and you don’t know how to manage your time? Sounds like an impulse control problem.
---
It was far too long after that lol. I checked
---
Is grinding mobs generally considered the fastest way to level, over questing? Assume I can’t time commit to dungeon spamming. I’m at about 6 days played and only level 42, probably because I am spending so much time traveling between zones and logging out every session in a capital city to post auctions.
---
Should I just embrace the grind and kill stuff for a few levels?
---
this is how I pulled as bear tank, even if you dont have a mage just jump on the side of the stair back and forth
---
With this username, is it a good idea?

Something along this macro can auto-send your pet to the target you are attacking (not sure of the spelling of autoshoot, look it up in the spellbook)

That's what I'm doing. I figured I'd cut out the middle man and I can sell off the excess herbs for some extra money.

Also, I chose to be a night elf for when I *do* die so the corpse runs are quicker.
---

---
You gotta kill green levels, mobe between questing aera so that you do mostly green quest and mobs. Also, dungeon is a good way to grind xp, take a shield and tank.
---
Can you provide any proof / resources for this?
---
\*starts sweating profusely\*
---
Lets go smokes.
---
&gt; Of course it doesn't affect melee.

And yet it did at some point.

---
Look up the addon "powered".
---
I play 8 hours a day and I still have plenty of content left.  Been 60 since Sep 22nd and I only have a couple pre-bis pieces.  I'm 4/8 for my tier 0 (even though it's shit, I still want it all).  I'm not exalted with any factions yet, I haven't touched secondary professions, I haven't set foot in U/LBRS, not attuned to Ony and have only done 4 bosses in MC.  I play a lot, but not efficiently; there's too much fun to be had.
---
Not to mention this is the best time to be leveling alts.  Enjoy the few perks of layering if your server still has it, the minimal incentive for ganking on PvP servers and the higher density of lower level players making it easier to find groups for those harder quests and dungeons.

&lt;Ascendance&gt; casual/semi-hardcore raiding guild
---
**Region:** EU
---
**Server:** Shazzrah, PvP
---
**Faction:** Alliance
---
**Raid:** Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules:** DKP
---
**About us:**
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach a more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and as such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help to secure the guild’s success.
---
Besides, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP, world bosses and such.
---
What we expect:
---
* You to play your class well and know the various boss/trash mechanics
---
* High raid attendance
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before the scheduled time) \[DKP on-time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie
---
* Mature people who can 
---
**What we do NOT expect:**
---
* We do not expect our members to spend a massive amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like:**
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)

For sure. That's cheap.
---
Blizz also handles exp farms and gold farms very differently. An exp farm that’s 2 times faster than anything else and makes use of infinite, fast respawns with little-to-no danger is not on the same level as lasher farming.
---
Stone renderers?
---
Many procs do not have an internal cooldown. Most, even.
---
ur thick brah

even if the drop rate was 99% you could still do 1,000,000 runs and not see it. That is how stats work

I've always called it VC.

People know what I'm talking about, why u heff 2 be so mad

Queue 30 minute curse

So, attack rolls work on a priority system. When an attack is made against the player, a roll is made between 1-10,000. the result is based on where the number falls based on the following things:
---
First, does it miss? Then, is it dodged? Then, is it parried? Then, is it blocked? If none of these things, then the rest of the attack table is filled with first crit % then chance of crushing blow (Might be the reverse, not sure which falls off first, crit or crush), and then the rest of the table is normal damage.
---
Therefore, if you have enough combined miss/dodge/parry/block to reach 100% against a lvl 63 opponent (which a bit higher than 100% due to the level difference, not sure the exact number. I only remember 102.4%, but I think that's BC) then you cannot be critically hit nor crushing, because all the attacks against you will already be filled up by misses, dodges, parries, and blocks.
---
That's the primary advantage of warriors. No other class can do this. It smooths out damage intake CONSIDERABLY.
---
Lol. I came here looking for this comment. Was not disappointed.
---
I was rude by asking a question? Wat?
---
Is DD direct damage? Haven't seen that one for a bit
---
I though you were into that shit, my mistake
---
What? A voice of reason on this subreddit?
---
When do I get the group stamina buff as a priest? Is it something I have to skill or can I learn it at the class trainer?
---
Cenarion Hold in Silithus from right before AQ patch and throughout that phase could be a good spot, I'd imagine.
---
Transmog is relatively new. Like 3 expansions. Heirlooms have been around since wotlk.
---
Doesn't stop there also being plenty of butt holes.
---
48 I think?
---
There are a bunch of new items that have a place in a warrior tank Pre-BiS list, mostly mitigation items. I don't think there is a single item that is a must have though.
---
Specifically to your question, Satyr's bow will replace Blackcrow on most BiS lists just because it's much easier to obtain. Draconian Deflector remains better than the Diremaul shield. 
---
There also is a new +hit ring, new mitigation options for hands, wrist and chest, and solid threat pants.
---
We've been in the business of raiding since vanilla, we've seen many rare mounts and drops quit and leave the guild. We now live on the side of caution and prefer to keep items in the guild, this is as great example of that. If you gquit over not getting a legendary in your first run with having shown no ambition to complete the item, good riddance. Better now than later.
---
These guys make leveling my warrior feel like a dark souls simulator
---
I do that, have a level 5 human alt deing stuff. 
---
I send him over armour pieces most of the time. Weapons I tend to vendor.
---
Wait, did something happen to Chubbydin?
---
Congrats! It only gets better !
---
What content was gated behind dailies in TBC?
---
So we are shorter for EU dates, longer for US dates. EU released one month after, US four months after.
---
Now we are having a release two months later, so about an average of the releases of EU and US back then.
---
So again, tell me what's so worrying?
---
Yea millions of people should wait for you to hit 60 in 2021. Good call, we'll just sit on MC for 12 months.
---
Since questing generally has you grinding mobs anyways, it’s a good way to get the best of both
---
Good point, it's just a bit frustrating sometimes that you don't participate but yeah it's faster that way.
---
I believe 50 is the cap for disenchanting
---
Just dont be poor lol
---
If its greens/blues level 51+ plus its worth it plus it depends on the item if its a weapon for 6 gold it might be more worth to vendor the item but if armor etc just DE is better, u can max skill up to 75 i think with just disenchanting
---
In communist Ironforge everyone get same table
---
I agree. But for some reason people don't think the same applies to video games. I always draw the parallel to other hobbies and competitions. But that never works.
---
Grinding out single mobs, one after another, with big regen breaks in between? No way you are faster. The only reason to do this is if you have run out of quests (or only shitty quests are left)
---
Thank you for your quick reply, I assume that it's a class trainer thing?
---
Blizzard is literally supporting the oppression of an entire people. But as long as you get to play your "fun" video game, then everyone affected by this can just go fuck themselves right

I must've been extremely lucky on my Priest...I did an full run without really knowing what was up, haven't been there in 10+ years.

End up getting Second Wind without even knowing it's a prebis, on my first run through BRD.
---
My Jed trinket, I got this the first time I went into UBRS. Won with a 99 roll against 6 mages and a resto druid.
---
1/2 to drop the leaf, and 1/(number of hunters that don't have it) to win it. With randoms it could potentially take forever, but in a guild you will most likely have it in a couple months or earlier (unless you're like my guild and get eye of divinity on every single kill.. not that I'm complaining).
---
Then there's the onyxia drop but that's easier to get from my experience, and the guild would probably prioritize it to a hunter that already has the leaf. And a couple hundred gold for blue sinew.
---
Farm your pre-raid bis.

You’re a bad parent, and sum up the problem with the player base of this game.

True, I think the main reason that farm was changed is its not effected by instance lock-outs.
---
Lasher farming will be locked to 5runs/per hour or what ever the lock-out is I'm not sure.
---
So maybe they won't do anything about it, it's more the effect it will have on alch mats I'm wondering about, plus the amount of high value greens on the loot table of these lashers like \[Travelers Backpack\].
---
Perhaps they'll nerf their loot table? Who knows.
---
I have started farming it before getting the quest, but really I see it as simple gold farming with the added benefit of maybe getting jackpot.

yah it is the problem. At original release it was effecting melee until nax release, someone pointed out at comments.
---
But I met a warrior dwarf who claimed that he had already done 150 BRD runs without seeing one.
---
also one more note, multi shot damage depends on the top end damage of your ranged weapon, which is higher with crossbows (since they are slower) so another reason why the crossbows are bis in other phases beside phase 1 and 2
---
Yeah, it was a bug, and it was fixed, far before 1.12.0.
---
Play the game yourself instead of obsessing over BIS lists

Use MoveAnything it saves everything the same for all characters
---
Man, wow is notorious for being able to pull you away from stuff you care about.
---
Good.
---
Fuck you.
---
depending on your server, I'd recommend just buying it of the auction house. Get the rank 2 one, you don't need the rank 1. The rank 2 codex book sells for &lt;15g on my server.
---
We had a battle yesterday while leveling in Stonetalon Mountain. 
---
A Priest I met there and me, a Warrior, both level 22 pvped some hordes. A Druid 24, Hunter 28, Warrior 25 we destroyed them so hard that they asked for help I guess, cause a few moments later there were some lvl ?? Who killed us, before it was an uneven battle in their favor and they couldn’t stand against us. Was pretty funny until the at least 10 lvl higher players came to “help”.
---
Honestly I just want to keep playing classic. Release Uldum. Release Hyjal. Release a new BG (like Attack / Defend). All of this after P6 obviously. 
---
Then... Maybe BC. But I'm extremely wary of Flying Mounts and Daily Quests.
---
while the DM mace is "really" good, Warden's is BiS  telling someone not to get their bis now?
---
I'm trying for the Reed now but I haven't seen it yet. Usually these runs are only to Rend which is like not even far away so you have to be a dick not to sign up for 10 more minutes max.
---
Not that you need the full 10, anyway.
---
Dont pick a pvp server then?
---
Surely that was a bug? What are the odds!
---
Yes. Farming DME lashers and the first boss in DMN can make you a ton of gold. Its like printing money. Assuming they sont do anything to nerf it or make the DMN boss unable to be solo'd
---
Boosting inGame is one of the biggest gold incomes. I play since vanilla (\~1900 days /played) and in my own experience the average player skill just went down. The casual part of the game just got bigger but anything above that is a pure gold mine for normal players.
---
thanks for sharing
---
Oh yeah i love sexy bald or orcs
---
100% my dude. I support your choice w/o a doubt :) Play classic how you want to do it.
---
You should visit STV at least three times - at 42-43, at 45-46 and at 48+
---
Ah fuck I haven’t farmed these out at all
---
He was only speaking of what happens when Naxx is out, not about what phase it’s released.
---
I've ran BRD arena 130+ times and haven't even seen the chest drop...
---
Yes it's true and everyone should know this.
---
what? 3 mages in SM is amazing xp i went 32-44 in a night
---
Thats not how economy works. 
---
If you buy hamburger minced meat, pickles, mao, and hamburger buns, it will cost much higher than what fastfood chains sell the hamburger for. 
---
If you try to sell like your way for 15gold. People are just gonna buy the mats for 15g and get it enchanted by a friends perhaps even gaining a skill point to a friend in proccess.

Thanks! I love stuff like this, and I also did not know about this functionality!!
---
It looks amazing!
---
Makes more sense. Should have just put that in the OP instead of deleting. :p
---
ArkInventory allows you to "design" your own bag. It has plenty of predefined categories to seperate your bag by and also allows you to define your own rules.
---
I'll not quit guys, thanks for the answers, got me thinking that I was saturated so I take 5 days off Azeroth, now I'm good to be back
---
I’m starting to believe this is an intentional design aspect I don’t know about.  I’ll be fighting something my level or lower, I’ll be destroying it, and when it gets to 2-5% health it will just start resisting EVERYTHING.  Not a boss, nothing with a rage timer, just a simple quest mob.  I see it all the time and it drives me nuts.
---
Are you a fan of Ayn Rand?
---
I love undead warriors. Nice job bro, he has glorious hair for a corpse.
---
I love you both
---
Couldn't you just click the mob in that instance..?
---
Best heartstone setting location.

masterloot... did someone ninja them?

Ffffuuuuuu really? Just tried and it really works!

---
Why the “lol 😂” if it’s not a laughing matter...
---
I've also played since vanilla and while what you say might apply to retail, the difference in skill level in classic compared to vanilla is *massive*. This is obvious from what items people pick, what specs people play, how good people are at judging dungeon pulls, when to use CC etc.
---
Sure not everyone is great but in general people are just better. Much better.
---
That sounds like a pretty miserable philosophy you have there. I'll pass on signing up for your newsletter.
---
I've head an undead lv 60 mage help.me.with my escord quest I would 100% fail otherwise
---
its hard to describe...or is it just me, maybe? i dont think "work for" is the right term. yes, you had to do some things to do other things, but you still have to do that. id say, "work on something to complete it", as that is the only thing that is gone. you still have quests to do, but they never end until the next expansion is out. you have to farm gear, but it all could be quadrupleforged megaepix so you are never finished with the latest content. you still have daylies to grind, they just never end. 
---
classic made you work for a thing that you need to get to the next thing that you want. you had a clear goal and a clear path. in retail there is no goal and everything is interchangeable
---
Sorry true. My guild hooked me up with mageweave bags when I started my toon, hooked me up with best in level blacksmithing gear for mats, hard carried me through the whirlwind axe quest line as soon as I hit 30 on my warrior. Wish there was someway to repay the guys who helped me, but I know that what they want is that I'll just do the same for the newer players coming up after me.
---
THIS is what I love most about this game. It's a solo adventure that feels so much like you're on the journey together with a whole world of people.

The fact that you're actually quitting says a lot about you...

Jokes aside, good on you for putting your family first. Willing to bet your a great parent. Excited to see a follow up post in roughly 6 years: "Kids are 18. Wife divorced. R14 Grind Here I Come!"
---
Unlike Paladins Druids do the actual tanking while taking advantage of the 5 second rule. Doing this every pull usually gets you to half mana and you are full mana by the time you shift back out
---
You don't need capital. If the prices are usually high, you can buy low and sell high. Market constantly self-corrects that way.
---
Many thanks!  
---
Great video, BTW.  I will be studying it over and over.
---
I never found one but am prepared to be unpleasantly surprised.
---
Fuck everything about them. Theyre literally impossible to kill as a frost mage
---
Do the mats disappear after summon or can they be reused?
---
That makes a lot more sense, those are significantly more important and further apart. Thanks for the info!
---
Hunter. It's the only one that really uses bows a lot (other classes do sometimes, but literally one shot per combat). It's also the easiest beginner class, you can get your own pet, among other things. Go hunter. You can be an alchemist on any class if you wish.
---
I only care about XP
---
&gt;Better mount
---
Yeah that's not what you call something that isn't a horse that is on fire.
---
If it goes on a shaman I'll help.
---
Warrior? Fuck outta here boy.
---
Pretty decent is an understatement. It's easily BIS for feral DPS and would require the druid to constantly farm more because each one has 3 charges. Warden staff is still BIS for tank through all of classic.
---
When will we get a megathread to discuss Blizzard's banning Blitzchung, taking his prize money, firing two casters and removing the vod? LET US VOICE OUR THOUGHTS
---
Seriously??
---
Probably has been answered. Rule is to let the dps die if they go retard aoe-dps at pull or nuke the wrong add without being able to handle it. Otherwise you will pull heal aggro and die. Warriors have 1 AoE taunt every 10 minutes. All other mobs need to be sundered/revenged one-by-one. I'm a tank myself. I always give the dps an SKULL target and start tanking the rest. I might taunt/stun the SKULL. I am constantly using my Taunt. It can be even used proactively too. Tab targeting is key as a prot warrior.
---
Its fine to start a pull while im drinking bc if i can gage healing while being able to hop in and still have sufficient mana its fine. But dont immediately do a big pull when im sitting on 200 mana.
---
Haha, no problem man, thanks for the kind words! If you have any questions or want to talk more about it, feel free to stop by the stream sometimes, I love theory-crafting druid builds.
---
It's the way the world works, and the way you works. You can lie to yourself as much as you want though. But you'll stay miserable.
---
Smart! I'll look into it, thank you
---
Not really. I got it a month ago when leveling my main.
---
This is low key great.
---
I'm a fan of reality, and this is how it works.
---
Gonna need a lot of Blinks back and forth to save as much time as you spent leveling to 20.
---
Only problem with females is people will refer to you as "her, she, etc".
---
Only problem with males is the 95 year old hunchback look and the ridiculously over exaggerated shoulder armor.
---
I mean, it is, but if you don't care, that's what really matters here.
---
Lots of living humans were also people of Lordaeron. Sent away and killed by the same undead before they become the Forsaken.
---
Are there any interactive site in which I can make my own build in advance skill wise ?
---
&gt; I'm actually kind of sad that I probably won't get to quest in Winterspring at all, which I have some strong nostalgia for, because I feel like I need to do BRD and the other dungeons now, so that I don't still have Maraudon / Sunken Temple gear at 60.
---
You will want to complete every green quest at 60 anyway since the exp will convert into gold.
---
Everything cost slightly more than vendor price, not worth the time, I just vendor everything
---
Seriously
---
They're actually releasing *slower* than in original Vanilla, but whatever.
---
What's the problem here exactly mate? Get your ass into Winterspring, WPL and EPL like everyone else. Do instances for quests, you're never gonna get that much from instances, especially shit like BRD which starts at like level 48
---
Are they really paying 2g for a run that goes well?
---
lol retail kids. Most ppl will blacklist them for pulling that shit don’t worry. Self-centered people don’t make it too far in vanilla.
---
As always: if you plan to equip it right away, roll need and equip it right away so everyone knows why you did it. In all other cases: roll greed.
---
As someone who farms high level chests on a level 1 alt, the non-locked ones have around 10-15% chance to have a green or better item.  In about 70 chests, I have seen one blue and like 10 greens.  100% of the time it is food and potions, unstacked, which feels like a bug tbh.
---
Yeah but back then we didnt have reddit forums and stuff like that, so you didnt hear about it as much. Consider how many reports there are against how many players are actually playing right now
---
I personally leveled my first class quickly to 60, now im enjoying my self with my alt, not a rush in the world :D
---
Females get the additional racial “Death by Snu Snu”
---
*Andrew Yang has entered chat*
---
Razor Gauntlets for dungeon tanking.
---
As much as I may hate wearing mail or even leather to tank with... You can handle a couple of pieces. You don't lose much mitigation, but the added threat, from hit especially, and the reduced resists of taunt is a godsend, especially with trigger happy dps.
---
I thought you lost honour from killing grey enemies/civillian tagged mobs
---
Hello, i got edgemaster handguards yesterday from a random mob ( [https://es.classic.wowhead.com/item=14551/manoplas-del-maestro-de-filos](https://es.classic.wowhead.com/item=14551/manoplas-del-maestro-de-filos)), im trying to sell them 600g in Skeram. Is that a good price? Also should i try to sell them in Gadgetzan or any auction house is okay? thanks
---
This is just the state of the game, a certain percentage of the population are just not people you want to interact with.  
---
Just yesterday I joined a group for a dungeon run, and we were looking for a shaman to heal and provide wf. A guy joined that was a couple level below what we would have wanted, but we decided to give him a shot.   
---
Turns out that he doesn't have any int gear so he goes oom in a single pull, brought no water, and generally doesn't know how to heal. After i died the second time we told him to at least go get some water, so he just ran off without ressing me, and quit the group once he was out of the dungeon.
---
Instant shitlist.
---
Sounds like a ban brewing
---
Been playing since vanilla, and never knew that neither, woah.
---
You're wasting 5% though
---
because that's the auction house cut on sales
---
I hit 57 yesterday. I might hit 60 by the end of the week. And I think I'll probably still be in the first 30% (?) of players who got to level 60.  
---
I happened to have 1 week off where I could play a lot since launch but that was just for regular vacation and not specifically for wow.  
---
I'm a lot faster than I was in vanilla but I still don't plan to burn myself out on classic by rushing to "complete" each phase 1-2 weeks after launch.  
---
My hope is to about hit the pace where I'm just about done with a phase when the next phase is released. Maybe slower, but not faster than that.
---
I know leveling enchanting often means doing enchants at a loss, but fiery weapon is really not the best way to get 285-300. We're talking 7g loss per skill point here, that's already more than it costs to do the cloak defense enchant.
---
Got to admit, I'm more amazed that you haven't been prompted to do a name change with a name like that? Or that "dicks" was even available :P
---
Congrats though :D
---
You aren't a warrior, no?
---
It is probably easier to find these auctions if you are for example miner or check the price of bars daily. If I see someone that undercuts the market price a lot when I am about to sell my bars I either buy up his supply or I won't post my bars. I don't know how patient you are when you are looking for materials right now.
---
Till the next Patch hits
---
We don’t have accurate data on the playerbase that’s for sure. Most likely is most accounts are under level 30 but also most of those likely have quit, because they didn’t really want to keep playing the game. 
---
A lot of players are 50+ now, but we have no idea what proportion they make up of the remaining active players. They are definitely a large portion on my high pop server since I don’t run across many low levels in comparison.
---
Nice! Very informative, i’ve have been leveling an alt (ENH) and was wondering what do i use mana for tbh. Btw i am only lvl 24 dont have WF yet
---
Don't play alone
---
Just plan on going after some mobs your pet can tank for a very long time without either dying.  Use as many instant shots as you can with the cheapest ammo you can buy.  If possible get an INT buff.  Shouldnt take terribly long to cap your skill.
---
Yep this! \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^
---
Interesting username to hours played ratio
---
Does Azshara have many quests in it? Questie lists quests there but not sure if that's a bug or real quests. Because Questie sent me to Silithus only to find there was no quests there.
---
fuck that dude! guy caused my mum and her partner to be stuck in cuba
---
I *think* you can drag the wanted spell from the spellbook to box. Otherwise try the same way as macros work: Heal (rank 1).
---
Wtf is this meme, in WoW EU dire maul was released like weeks after launch. This is not a faster pace, and not everyone is american.
---
No problem, go ahead. However, you will need to buy ammo, as arrows are for bows only. Also, your weapon skill will be low when you start to use it, but it'll level up quick.
---
Majority of guilds on my Vanilla  (EU) server didn't clear MC until after BGs were introduced - bringing some insane items like IBS/TUF/Immoveable Object/Don Julio's etc - I don't really see adding DM items as trivialising the content.. when the content is already trivialised by some of the item changes which should have happened in later phases.
---
Remember bosses taking 1 minute while in blues in Vanilla? Not until WAY later.
---
I think releasing DM right now is a good move, adds more flavour to people leveling - I for sure wish I spent less time in BRD on the way to 60
---
Well shaman you'll probably want to heal and spec for windfury for your group. I never played a druid in classic but they're great since you can shapeshift so much and fulfill any role you want; heal, tank, dps, ranged dps, or just go aquatic form and swim!
---
Fuck blizzard
---
&gt;and Blizzard's decision
---
The point is blizzard does not do very much filtering on the front end. They do not have time to audit everyones name. But if you get reported 10 times, they are going to review it, and most likely force a change. FakeNews is obviously a name that would never stick.
---
Wait um.. how did you do that?? Only 1 person can ride those things I thought??
---
I know. I actually find it's some caricature of Warcraft, not Warcraft. Everything there is so ridiculous like some horrible mishmash of every game out there. Whatever gets plebs to spend money in blizzard store I supposed. keeps the classic servers running.
---
How is it not the right place to discuss this? This is the company making our game. Fuck off
---
Technical POV again: Yes - detecting that is very easy. 
---
It depends on what your company tolerates, and of course, if they are even allowed to spy on your traffic (work law in some countries prohibits that).
---
Its not handing out food/drinks that annoys me, its the lack of courtesy people seem to have. Say thank you, dont be a cave dweller being polite goes a long way.
---
i got my first ever BOE (Blue) yesterday, at level fucking 47......47 leveling and only one boe lolol
---
Anyone can pick up blacksmithing or engineering, and they can unlock the chests as well.
---
Are you sure about those mats? I've seen different things when I google...  
---
\- 3 dragonscale vs 35  
---
\- 1 ACB vs 3 ACB
---
Rule 3. Block out the names.
---
You also lack all context in the picture so it wouldn't matter anyway.
---
Don't you know the law of conservation of rage? The amount of rage is constant it just moves from player to avatar and back. The less rage the avartar has, the more the player has and vice versa.
---
The fact that you only got it on your 5th skill is what scares me here
---
Leveling is more fun than farming dungeons and raid logging at level 60. Change my mind.
---
Yes, in the form of crit it provides threat (and rage via talents)

Macros work if you always use those to mount/dismount. There is also [ItemRack Classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemrack-classic), which should work better as you can define item sets for conditions. Haven't used those events myself yet though, but worth a try.
---
United States here, I’m sure they have every right.
---
I understand it will be detectable, but I’m just not sure how much of a red flag it would be versus what I’m currently doing (entering data into a spreadsheet while watching Hell’s Kitchen).
---
Because they feel that they deserve to control the market because they "know" what everything is worth. And they want everyone to automatically collude with them so that they and their actions are important and make them money.
---
How is blizzard a trash company?
---
I just did Wetlands at 29 and starting Hillsbrad now at 32. I'd put them in the same category as Thousand Needles tbh.
---
I'm sorry for your experience. It's a situation born of assumption (you assumed everyone could lot the chest, the other players assumed you knew it didn't work like that but you did it on purpose anyway)
---
One lesson is to never assume. It's always valid, for all of us.
---
Advice: lean to touch type so you can communicate better.
---
Pay attention to party chat.
---
I'm on a mobile phone so I have to quit here
---
(Also: I am not sure I have any other good advice)
---
Good luck, be polite and have fun! :)
---
And I thought I was flash for hitting 60 in SW as a Nelf. Well-played sir / madam, well-played...
---
Well the problem with bloodseeker is it comes out the same patch as the crossbow of smiting.
---
I never did it on a live server but I did it a lot on the Elysium private server.
---
You don’t really need good gear for it but the better gear you have the more efficient you’ll be at farming DM N.
---
In terms of outside potions etc, you need to have engineering to make the bombs needed to blow up one of the doors. You also need lesser invisibility potions to get through one of the rooms.
---
I have no idea if it will be possible on classic wow but if it is I might have to level a hunter just to farm this.
---
There are videos from vanilla doing it.
---
I think they did what they did so they dont get shafted out of chinas market
---
I see. I downloaded the blizzard launcher once before and it seemed to block all traffic passed that.
---
The left lane is the “fast” lane no matter the speed limit
---
second this. Its not like you plundered the chest after majordomus jeez, its the friggin FIRST dungeon. What was in there, the equivalent of 10 silver?
---
More ettiquette: Let the tank pull. She or he will know what to do, so let them. Don't start by getting as much attention from mobs as possible. And if you do (sometimes you can't help it), run towards the tank, not away from him.
---
Exactly the reason why I gamble for jackpots etc. It's a 50-50 chance I win, either I win, or I lose. Somehow, I've been unlucky so far though!
---
How is that ironic?
---
K ERNING
---
Ty
---
Holy moly how can i not know that, ive also played for 15 years
---
Get you a lady friend who respects a man with a hobby and fucks straight off when they feel any notion of disrespecting that. Be the man you want to be and the people who don’t want to support you in your endeavor can smd tbh gl hf. 
---
But also don’t be an asshole and maintain social relationships and don’t neglect responsibilities. Balance is key.
---
I somewhat think the early points in impale are a bit wasted. I usually put points there after skilling axe spec and cruelty. Without those talents you sit at around 5% crit and that's not worth the improved crit damage imo.
---
Thanks a lot.

 Hey so I just installed WoW classic because I wanna try it again
---
I played on Ravencrest Vanilla - TBC, but since that is not a server now, I wonder which would be the closest server to replica Ravencrest from back in the day?
---
Ravencrest was a server which was mainly Alliance and majority of the players on the server came from denmark, sweden and norway 📷
---
Yes and they received a game that had already been released patched and content developed for months. Basing the timeline of content released based on a region that received a game late is flat out stupid.
---
My analogy isn't to compared the "importance" of europe to some random country, it's to highlight the flaw in the fundamental logic of basing content release on the timeline of a region that received the game late.
---
To highlight the absurd stupidity of this logic even further, what if Europe got WoW a whole year later than America? Based on the stupid European logic, we should be okay with BWL being released at launch? Do you understand how stupid this is?
---
And don't forget this all stems from the guy saying DM was released EARLIER in vanilla than it is being released now. Even if his logic wasn't all kind of stupid, then what about the AMERICANS and the AMERICAN timeline? Why do we arbitrarily decide that the European timeline is the right one?
---
They are obligated to make money for their shareholders, not uphold you moral standards.
---
So players arent overwhelmed in content. What was vanilla was released over a long time.
---
Any chance you’re on pagle?
---
To mimic how original wow was released. Later phases are stronger than earlier phases. Content overpowers oneanother.
---
Did you do it at lvl 60? The xp that you don't need anymore if you are already 60 gets converted to gold reward.
---
same i always just see an empty trade window and silence
---
That is the most optimised pull I've seen honestly.
---
youre telling me to try harder? not the guy posting 2 lines of from trade?
---
Truly lowering their ideals of freedom to suck on warm teat of China.
---
\#SomeChanges
---
You can use Shift+TAB to target previous target, so you don't need to TAB 5 times to cycle again.  
---
However, didn't know this feature either.
---
With blacksmithing its usually everyone who can open the chest rolls.
---
With rogues its everyone. Thats the name of the game.
---
Proffession get prio. If its a class skill everyone gets to benefit from it.
---
Stop putting it on the AH.  You're going to burn all your profit in fees by the time you sell it.  Just spend some time spamming trade on Friday and Saturday nights and throw it in you bank.  You can post it those nights as well, but even then your best bet is to sell it through trade.
---
That’s why all the private servers with true Vanilla timeline died. /s
---
Once you get 5% hit and 20ish crit dungeons are fucking lol as DW fury. It's heaps of fun when the crit train starts and you hit 400 single target. WF totem makes this so much better aswell
---
If they didn't roll it out in phases it wouldn't make sense....vanilla didn't launch with everything phase 1 - 6 will bring
---
Did I miss something?
---
On my server exe sells for more than kang. So the cost isn't always the difference maker.
---
Welcome back you casual player. Haha
---
Not nearly that much on my server. I already bought all the mats and its cost me roughly 150g. That doesn't include the 400g for the rest of it. The only thing that cost was the Arcanite Bars.
---
losing your mp5 for 5 seconds when if the mana you're gonna get back in that time was that important for the next mob you're gonna kill you would just be drinking anyways? was it the getting interrupted while casting your mount in pvp/bgs? because the first option again if losing out on that mana is going to cost you that much that you can't kill the next mob you'd be drinking not to mention the mob would have to be a fair distance away for you to mount up just to run to it. interrupting someone casting their mount in pvp/bgs just doesn't happen ever. so unless you have any actual reasons for why it's actually better i'd love for you to actually provide them because the ones you've already mentioned aren't actual issues.
---
Just finished the quests around Tanaris + doing the ZF dungeon. 
---
What zone/dungeon should I go to next?
---
I hope you are right so there would be no worries on that score.
---
Though really I don't mind dailies at all. I find that they help me get into a rhythm when I log on by giving me something mindless to do while I think about what I'd really like to do that day. It's the gating that's the issue.
---
Uhh.. you can still do what you said you were doing, you don’t need to catch up, seems bitter
---
&lt;Must be hard to make gold as a mage!&gt;
---
Toxic logic.
---
I mean people do exactly the same thing now with xp runs/arena anger runs/lava runs.  Nothing changed
---
I would love if you were to elaborate, as far as I know tbc is widely accepted as one of the best additions to a game ever created, well balanced and great content, things can be said about flying mounts, be t in general there's a lot of ppl who are overwhelmingly pleased with TBC.
---
Something tells me you don't know shit......
---
I can tell you with confidence that you need 35 of the scales and 3 arcanite bars
---
Reported for breaking the rules
---
The point is to prevent him from life tapping and bandaging, which is what they SHOULD be doing.....? That's a shit point.
---
To simulate the progressive content release of vanilla.
---
As a long time WoW player, and enthusiastic Classic player, this is killing me. I really cannot pay for these games and play them knowing that this is where they stand on freedom of speech - this issue aside, but simply by principle. Fuck Blizzard for doing this.
---
You're one level higher than me and I've been playing this game for over a decade. Although I'm extremely casual.
---
Because retail is easy, killing lower levels is also easy
---
Sane
---
I can’t even begin to explain how wrong you are about this. It’s not about greed, it’s about lengthening out the content to be able to twice the classic experience. By having everything available day 1 it would give the AQ and Naxx pre-events any weight. It would dull the experience. Others will be able to communicate this better as I have no time being at work rn.
---
Thanks, that answers the question.
---
they're just stacked
---
out of interest, did you follow that quest guide the whole way? Iv got the same one, but im worried if i sway from its path for a few levels its gonna bite me in the ass and be like "ohh, remember that quest we picked up 43 years ago? the one in the hidden cave, behind the most difficult to reach platform, that's unobtainable after 0.001 seconds, and it compltetly integral to the whole leveling guide? yeah....we gotta hand that one in" then i'll spend till TBC just trying to find it.
---
Not reslly
---
I work 40h/week as a system engineer, have my hobbies and social life; most of my guild are in similar circumstances. We don't consider ourselves hardcore by any mean, yet we're mostly pre-raid BIS or working on it, and raiding with some randoms to fill spots.
---
Sounds like you don't want to play the game for your own enjoyment, so others can't either? Your point doesn't stand.
---
Twice*
---
holy shit dude I just quoted you the rule and you're arguing....with the rule.  read that shit
---
Thanks man, didn't expect I'd ever get my hands on it especially not like this.
---
I've been playing this game for 15 years, and there is still new shit I learn about it almost every day. Was this fact written down somewhere and I just missed it. Did everyone else just notice this on their own. Am I retarded for not noticing this? GOD WHAT ELSE DON'T I KNOW!!!
---
Warriors have to take cooking/fishing/first aid since they have no self heal. If you can afford to buy food you can skip some of that but you wont be able to do that if it's your first character. Leveling these slows your leveling down. They have no travel ability at all which slows your leveling down. They dont have any aoe for a while so pulls are one mob at a time. They are melee so they have to be careful where they pull. These slower pulls slow your leveling down. They cant easily avoid ganks in the open world. These will slow your leveling down. Everything warriors must do is slower than the other classes.
---
What happen? Did Blizzard kill you cause you are pro democracy and anti human oppression seen in Hong Kong?
---
&gt; similar to human skeleton
---
with a female gnome head and shoulders
---
"You don't need spirit" everyone uses spirit.
---
Do all weapon enchants give a glow of some sort or is it only specific ones?
---
This is reflective of company policy and therefor the company which owns this game.
---
They broke rules. They got banned for good reasons.   
---
Stop with this nonsense.
---
I'm not asking people to harrash them just avoid being in parties with them
---
I have the same issue. I did not have kids 13 years ago when I played up to LK. Now I have a 4 and 5 year old, and a said in another reaction, time management is key!
---
Yes it's fine for Europeans, so it's fine for half the population. If NA wants some special treatment, they can ask for it and be denied, or they can adapt to the European norm, and stop being so loud about something so insignificant.  
---
And there's no reason to resort to insults, everyone already knows the stars are dimmer on your side of the Atlantic.
---
 the banned people had a contract that forbid them to talk about politics, and they broke it.
---
if a normal streamer would have done it or if they did it elsewere it would have  been ok to do so.
---
these streamer are so high up they represent blizzard, thats why blizzard dont want them to push there own agenda
---
the action blizzard took was totaly fine
---
Well, when most servers in server list is listed as FULL... i think it was last night, was playing for a while in the afternoon. Logged off, thinkin i might want to play later on. Put myself into que, not even at prime time. Took 2h+ to get back in. Prime time ques are in the 3-4h mark.
---
lol poor Chile
---
I opened an Iron Lockbox once and got a 2 gold tip, without even asking. I mean, that's generous and I appreciate it but you're likely to make a net loss mate. :v
---
EU WoW was out less time on release when DM was dropped.
---
When saying this, let us be clear that we are saying “fuck the Chinese government”. China is beautiful and its people are just people; it’s just that the people in their government are evil.
---
Not really. Like take a mage for example. A leveling guide will show you a AoE oriented frost build. A PvP guide a PvP oriented frost build and a high end PvE guide an arcane/frost build.
---
But honestly, after you're done leveling up, you should be able to make your own build depending on what you want to do.
---
Start with the shield
---
/equip shield
---
/equip sword
---
It worked for me
---
Seeing as the subject of this specific post is about this subs mods. Surely Rule 1 doesnt apply now. Hoping this post makes it as all posts about the ban situation that were above and below this post got swiftly deleted.
---
People need to see this.
---
But how in the world will I wand mobs from the pack behind the group we're pulling while healing?!
---
How does a rogue need spirit?
---
Any druid trainer in a main city, not the moonglade one.
---
My mage got 2x Thunderfury from Vancleef last night
---
I'm cancelling my wow subscription today. Done with this company.
---
Nothing was lost to me. I enjoyed rushing the leveling as it was a race that I had fun being in.
---
&gt; the slim look of the female orc.
---
we did it to *literally*. let's do it to *slim*.
---
Should I roll for locked chests....? I took the time to level my lock picking and get my thieves tools.   
---
PS I agree with you.
---
TBH if you're enhancement, the game is way, way easier if you opt to kill stuff 2-3+ levels below you. Really this goes for any melee class. 
---
What's your current setup weapon/spell wise? Regardless, the 5s rule is critical. Front load your spells, then withhold casting as long as you can to regen mana. Use bandages instead of healing spells after fights. The more you can regen, the lower your downtime. 
---
 If you're using a 2H, high weapon damage is critical to not sucking. For 40-50, you should look for mograines might/ravager-&gt;rockpounder-&gt;gatorbite/scepter. I specced Stormstrike and improved lightning shield, so my general rotation is AA/SS/lightning shield/AA until dead. Rank 1 earthshock for interrupts, searing totem and/or flame shock if the mob has high hp. Stormstrike is absolutely not necessary, but it's personal choice, and increases the damage mobs take from LS.
---
Solo vs elites I use a fast 1h+shield with WF, although flametongue might be better, I've got a high damage dagger and decent crit so I kill stuff relatively quickly. Here I'll drop SoE/GoA/mana spring/searing and keep LS up. Not sure if flame shock is efficient, but I will keep the dot up on most things.
---
No one has the right to use blizzard as a platform to advance their own political agenda. No one is stopping them from continuing to be activists for Hong Kong, but you are not going to be representing Blizzard when you do it.
---
I'm only 53 at this point in time and probably won't hit 60 for another week and a half, so guess my best shot is just going for Satyr's Bow, thanks :\^)
---
Out of combat hp regeneration.
---
I was fired for installing an MMO on a work computer a couple years ago. Granted it used Xigncode which red flagged the company's network security.
---
Trust me, it is NOT worth the risk. Finding another job after being fired is not easy. For a lot of employers it will immediately disqualify you.
---
Mods banning anything related to it.  Bunch of spineless cowards
---
Its okay dude^^ youre right
---
That is completely irrelevant. Blizzard made a rule. A professional player broke it and faced the punishment in accordance with Blizzards rulebook. There is nothing more to it. Direct your anger at Blizzard headquarters, not /r/classicwow
---
Nobody cares.
---
What
---
Rogue and druid are the only classes that use stealth mecanics. Both are pretty fun to play:)
---
By posting this you passively do, though.
---
&gt;  Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.
---
By that logic we could have news about anything blizzard related like Overwatch tournaments or retail wow.  
---
It's not classicwow related despite your passion for the topic.
---
Diseased black bear 😂
---
That's a weird way of spelling mage 🤔
---
&lt;SSQRL&gt; Super Squirrel Squad | Alliance (PvP) | Blaumeux | Casual Raiding
---
Who we are: We are a group of friends and ever expanding gaming community that came together in 2015 with a goal in mind, to help raise money through extra life for our local children’s hospital (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia). Although we have busy lives, a bunch if us took the plunge into WoW classic. Some of us are veterans that raided Naxx in vanilla, others are new and experiencing classic for the first time, and everything else in between.
---
What we want to accomplish: We want to group together with mature players that want to experience content at a more casual pace, but more importantly we want to get chill people to join us and our community. We plan on leveling up and doing some raids, with some PvP mixed in here and there. Discord is up and website is still pending.
---
Raid times: TBD. We have alot of people from varying walks of life (some with kids etc.) We’re still figuring out our raid times, but most likely towards the weekend (Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays). For now, we are thinking Friday Nights, Saturday &amp; Mornings **Note: It would only be 1 raid a week, not all 3 days
---
Raid Loot Rules: For now, i think we can /roll on items and be fair about it. In a full guild run my preferred style is loot council.
---
Recruiting Needs: Right now, we still have a number of folks leveling. We need all classes 45+. I will also be in the hunt for some class officers to help with loot council and raid control.
---
Up front rules: Dont be a jerk (unless its to the horde). If I need to say more than this, it probably isn’t the guild for you.
---
How to get in touch: Message me on Bootaylight (Paladin) either in game or through mail, and we can chat.
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/YgTR9DC
---
So if I wanted to replicate your macro, it would look something like this?
---
    /cast [mod:shift/alt] Healing Wave(Rank 1); Healing Wave
---
I don't think the macro is causing it, I'd say try disabling all your addons first and see if the problem goes away.
---
Hopefully you can suss out an addon, but otherwise try resetting all your settings to default. While the game is closed, rename your WTF and INTERFACE folders to WTF_old, etc. Delete your cache folder.
---
Done with Blizzard. You don’t defend oppression for profit. Fuck anyone here supporting them too
---
it's all I could grab rest was already gone and it's me asking if they changed to master loot cause when looting it didn't roll and was confused
---
You literally replied to their initial comment, why?
---
Get behind innkeeper. Problem solved.
---
I don’t have enough mana - Night elf warrior
---
Glad I'm not the only one choosing to speak with their money.
---
Even if she were, sm I supposed to be insulted by that?
---
I got my hunter to lvl 44 but decided i want to take a break and lvl a unconventional AoE Paladin for Farming. My whole build is weird and people tell me "its wrong". I dont care if its generic, it works and i enjoy it.
---
This is reflective of company policy and therefore the company which owns this game.
---
You can get the addon like people say but I don't. Mostly it's based on weight. The more your armor weighs the more it will likely vend for. But that doesn't apply to necklaces and rings which are more valuable just like jewelry IRL. And weapons are at the top, again generally the heavier the weapon the more it's worth.
---
The dude broke competition rules so I don't care.
---
Finally... The guy wrote "Click?!" not bacause he doesnt know what it means, but because "pros" frown upon using your mouse to activate spells, you should have everything binded to a key on your keyboard to be a "good player" :D
---
I doubt anybody sees out of combat hp regen as a priority tho.
---
Had to upvote solely based on your willingness to try something new. Wish I could get my wife to do the same
---
Download ItemRack, create a set for combat and for mounting for swapping. You can macro equipping itemrack sets. Then just make a mount/dismount macro with your item set.
---
Well technically they are the peoples organs it is communist china after all.
---
Went elemental at 40. Best decision i made. Ench is as mana consuming as elemental the difference is i can blow up 3 mobs at once with elemental.
---
ok cool thanks what about at endgame what kind of weapons is best there
---
there is a zeppelin between org and uc though
---
No spell for that, you have to drop them again.
---
Hardly breaking news, it was posted several times already...
---
It becomes classic wow related when someone halts their subscription to this game because of the policy related to another of Blizzard's games. If a news article cropped up that classic wow subs were dropping following this news, only then it should be allowed on this sub? Or will it be allowed even then? Not asking you directly, just frustrated and shouting at the air at the moment.
---
They should. Censorship to suck up to China is a big fucking deal.
---
No, blizzard is enforcing their rules. While the rule is impressively broad, hearthstone is their game and in their opinion he violated the rules. Why don't you boycott Chinese products if you feel so strongly?
---
Had a quick look at those aswell, reckon they're allright for dungeons to increase clear speed but Boneclenched Gauntlets/Stonegrip Gauntlets win in terms of mitigation in a raid setting?
---
Lol rogues and warriors do. Faster heal times after pulls. There's a reason so much leveling gear gives spirit on mail and plate.
---
I thought Priests and Druids could train rank 1 at a class trainer but need to find or buy a book to learn rank 2(max rank)
---
Bye. No one has the right to use Blizzard as a platform to advance their own political agenda. They are free to continue advocating for Hong Kong, but they will not do it will representing Blizzard.
---
Anything with dismount when you are actually mounted will require 2 clicks.
---
1st one dismounts second click does everything else.
---
Just a few tip:
---
One person can kill the adds or/and  take the damage from the fear if he is in range of Solenor. 
---
Just avoid doing direct damage to Solenor.
---
Yes don't want to upset the Chinese censors.  If Blizzchung said "Free Iraq" would the same punishment be dealt?
---
Didn't you hear? Blizzard is a Chinese company now.
---
metallica made a song about it. sad but true.
---
L***MAO***
---
Yes he did! I love this serie so much!  Feist is one of my favourite autors.
---
There needs to be a site with honest people running it that won’t suck corporate clock or go on SJW censorship fits.
---
Its exactly like this.
---
Not sure atm
---
I'm sure your 13$ will hurt them more than the entire Chinese market bud.
---
Yeah no dude. Sometimes you just kill people and camp the GY for shits and giggles. Not everything people perceive in pvp encounters is because one player has some grandstanding angst. 
---
I cant wait til phase 2 where people like you and OP are camped for hours or until you altf4 purely because pvp grind.
---
Is that stv? I am coming for u.
---
so from what you are saying you think they should be alowed to suport whoever they want?  if the streamer would have promoted the taliban in the name of blizzard would that be ok? 
---
i know you would say no, but where is the line. Blizzard just dont wont people to push ANY agenda by themselfs while representing them.
---
Here is what OP said before it was removed.
---
&gt;With the banning, stripping of prize money, and arbitrary firing of announcers on Hearthstone for simply expressing their opinion on the Hong Kong protests, I am feeling very uneasy giving a penny to Blizzard ever again.
---
​
---
&gt;Here's the dilemma. I have played Blizzard games for literally decades, with my favorite all time game being Diablo 2. 
---
&gt;In the recent years, I have seen nothing but shitty subpar games getting released by Blizzard. The most impactful fucking game they've made in the last 10 years WAS A REMAKE OF THE GAME FROM 20 YEARS AGO. That's why all of you are even reading this ranting post anyways.
---
&gt;What they did to the Diablo franchise with the real money auction house was despicable and they should be ashamed. Following that up with a shitty mobile announcement shows that I have fearing for awhile.
---
&gt;Blizzard has completely, and utterly lost touch with their fan base. They have moved beyond even providing a facade of artistic pride, and have to resort to simply rerolling games from 20 years ago to inspire nostalgia because all their new games are boring as fuck.
---
&gt;I love classic wow. I realize it's a 20 year old game. I don't want to support Blizzard anymore, especially after considering the anti-democratic movements occuring around the world.
---
Sometimes, things are bigger then video games.
---
I completely agree and am also cancelling my account. Good riddance Blizzard.
---
Drinking by itself is slower than just life tapping and bandaging/eating. I guarantee you're just healing them too early, you'd have to be braindead to just sit there at 1% health. Give them a second, if they're not begging you for a heal they're probably fine.
---
Also work full time and do other life stuff after work so I don't actively level during the week. Only Friday night and the weekend. I'm at almost 9 days played and level 58. Only benefit of DM coming out this early is that I don't need to drop 350g+ on a warden staff and can just get my discount mace instead.
---
The latest client is based off the BFA client
---
"No real world politics"
---
A tradeoff to consider is the increased likelihood of an attack speed proc from aspect of the hawk talents when you use a fast bow.
---
So fall damage is a percentage of you max hp. 
---
Buffing stamina adds raw hp pool, but their current hp stays the same, so their current hp % is lower.
---
Buff someone with stamina as they jump off the zeppelin. They expect to take 80% damage and survive, but you just gave them 30% more hp pool. The fall damage will kill them.
---
/Point
---
/Laugh
---
A ton of people. New players, alts etc.
---
It doesn’t make any sense moving to BC. At least... at *some point* this storyline needs to diverged from retail wow. I’m of the opinion that it was a bunch of little things that added up to a big problem. 
---
If they want to release BC, they need to remove all the bad things that came with it. If they release WotLK, they need to remove all the bad things with it. But “removing” bad elements of the game sort of forces issues to arise. For example, flying needs to go. But if you remover flying from BC, certain zones will be inaccessible due to how they designed the game around the new mechanic. What are they going to do? Re-create old zones to account for the lack of flying? It might just be easier to start fresh.
---
What does this shit says about Blizzard fans? They are seeing their favorite publisher acting like complete fascists and they don't care? You rather protect your favorite publisher and turn a blind eye to human lives being destroyed by a regime that Blizzard is supporting and protecting?  
---
You value Blizzard more, enough to suppress dialogue, than you value the people who are suffering under such oppressive regime?  Stop to think about what you are doing mods. You are defending a studio, protecting and silencing people who are raising awareness about the fucked up shit happening in Hong Kong.  
---
Enjoy Diablo Immortal. This is the fight you are pursuing. Defending shitty publisher in favor of human rights.
---
And the human rights of the people who have been brutalized by the HK protesters mean what exactly? Nothing?
---
I don't know. At the end of the day, if you had enough evidence you could bring it to blizzard. No need to bring it here lacking all context to start a witch hunt
---
mage wateeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
---
What the hell?!
---
I did.
---
A guy made a political statement about Hong Kong on a stream. Bliz fired the streamers and banned the guy from hearthstone tournaments. 
---
Apparently blizzard has a rule where the reserve the right to ban anyone if someone offends someone. Apparently this statement showing support for Hong Kong offends someone.
---
That being said fuck china.
---
TRUE VANILLA EXPERIENCE + BRING BACK MY YOUTH
---
Some people seem to think freedom of speech means you can say whatever you want whenever you want. 
---
I’m sure the people in an uproar now wasn’t doing a thing for Hong Kong before today.
---
Yet double, triple, quadruple the resources. Because there are double, triple, quadruple the number of environments.
---
Is that like a personal attack or something?
---
No, I won't.
---
You dont raid MC or Ony as 40 people if youre in a "hardcore" guild, so I would say increase that number by 40% atleast. From my experience tanking dungeons this week atleast 25% of the people have some epics since P1 is easier to pug than club penguin.
---
Blizzard proved it has compromised morals and will kowtow to China to silence political dissidents.  If your corporate responsibility is to an authoritarian government, well that makes me feel open disdain towards you.
---
I was today year's old...
---
You did the right thing.  That is all.  No debate necessary.
---
i know what you mean and i am on your side i gueue,
---
but especialy this example with the contracted streamer is the wrong starting point. i dont think blizzard did something wrong this time. only if this happens more often and is always only againt china, then yes, blizzard sucks. but for now, with one example, its realy not relevant
---
^ a 100x this!
---
I'm basically in the exact same boat. Hit 53 last night. Sacrificing sleep to play due to family responsibilities and children. 
---
DM is just going to offset everything so much. There is no way the majority of people are at high 50s/60 waiting for this content. Most MC raids I see weekly are pugging people still unless it's the hardcore guilds.
---
Also click the link to see one weird trick on how to always roll 90+!!! Blizzard devs hate it!!!+++++
---
That's two swings and two misses. Did it occur to you that maybe  my point was just what I said? This sub has loads of idiots who hate retail and worship classic even when the things they claim to hate about retail are the exact things they claim to worship about classic.
---
No need to wait for full mana before pulling. I prefer the tanks to pull when I'm at 50-60%.
---
Allows the tank to build threat on things and makes the run smoother/quicker in my opinion.
---
It is literally the company making our game which is making atrocious decisions against free speech.
---
Their largest market is China. China is currently trying to annex Hong Kong and sees them as rightfully theirs. 
---
Everyone bows to China's authoritarianism.
---
[Here !](https://imgur.com/N2EsGuD) I really like the purple on the sides, I had to put a shirt on to take the pic or it'd be kinda nsfw. And the addon is just Bagnon :\]  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bagnon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bagnon)
---
Then you better pack it up and head to the woods and live off the land, because literally every company abuses human rights to create cheap commodity goods.

Next time it happens, ask them to show you what hellfire does..haha

[Source](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#miss). With +5 skill you use the second formula instead of the first.

As for the reliability of the formulae, they are corroborated by actual measurements that are available in the above source. In addition, I should note that they were originally given by a Wowwiki commenter who is suspected to be a Blizzard employee.
---
Going to bed very am and getting up early af has become the new norm.
---
Reposting from a thread that was deleted:
---
The mods keep deleting this because it’s “not relevant to classic wow”. On the contrary, I believe this is deeply relevant information to WoW, because it made me cancel my WoW sub immediately. Blizzard's only morality is money, and that's the only way we can make a statement that this is unacceptable.
---
No that's not it at all, But thanks for your input!
---
No I wont, I'm loving playing classic again!
---
Yeah if these actions get under your skin you should play PvE servers. There is no shame in that. No sense in trying to cope with gankers and campers when there are other options.
---
I did and said they can't do anything about it cause they changed the tos so that what they did is shitty but not against tos and told me stuff about they'll just get a bad rep and people will know not to party with them
---
So why did the casters get fired too, despite not doing anything wrong?
---
Why did their Chinese forum mods say "we don't allow political opinions" yet in the same post say they support the hong kong police?
---
Are you this uninformed yet trying to state a valid opinion or what?
---
Nah, I'm grateful that this event offends me enough to take action to rid my life of the addictive time sink that this game is. I don't need or want a replacement.
---
If I have no need to do a dungueon no way im doing it free. Specially if I could be doing something else.
---
That said, the guy tried to bring stupid drama to the guild when you guys had a conversation. Fk it. Do what you want but dont fucking bring drama like a 10 years old.
---
Ya, god forbid you speak against authoritarian governments.
---
Looks like they are censoring the threads about this in the warcraft subs.   
---
Blizzard is actively working to censor political decent.   
---
20 years ago Americans would have been horrified to see other Americans capitulate so completely to anti-democratic repressive government censorship.   It is as unethical as it gets to participate, even indirectly in, in the repression of people wanting freedom.   
---
But we do it now without even blinking.
---
Nope
---
Going to hard disagree.  Today's playerbase is better by far...but even if by default they weren't they still have better guides &amp; add ons.
---
In the end they'll be better off one way or another.
---
So if heirlooms didn't tick those boxes you'd think they were amazing?
---
If you are still 25 you would take 8 months to reach 60 more or less.
---
Priest - Vampiric Touch :-D
---
The dude was showing support with hk protests that are taking place because they want a more democratic place to live in which seems more like a human right to me than a political opinion.
---
Blizzard is taking no stance on human rights. That's the fucking point. They don't want anyone who represents them to take a side. They do not want to be brought into this fight.
---
I'm more worried about decent one-hand weapons. I only have Trash Blade now and I can get Mirah's Song by the end of the day. On the other hand, I have Demonshear in my bags.
---
I saw you in Silithus last night trying that Demon for a while. Glad ya finally got it!
---
Wait is this because of DM? Or some other reason? Why would people be unsubscribing? Thank you

I think you might need two presses no matter what, but try this.

Nope, i think its a fun game.
---
You'll find groups for every run you need don't worry, Scholo and Strat are very relevant even in phase 2, there will always be alts slow lvlers etc playing.
---
The silithus demon is buggy with his resets which doesn't seem to be consistent with vanilla or pservers, but the other demons go down easy just how the countless guides out there tell you to do them.
---
Grab a warlock from your guild and have him clear your path on the winterspring demon and do the fear truck in silithus and it's a cakewalk.
---
Yep a lock of warlocks wait until I’m finished drink to tap. Please don’t. Try and tap at the end of combat so I can throw a heal or Renew on you THEN sit and drink/regen
---
Not wow classic related. Plenty of subs to discuss about this
---
Reroll then, mages are that.
---
Some people maybe not comprehending it doesnt make it misinformation. Its the truth. Feel free to add to the topic by giving additional information. Telling shit because the truth doesnt suit you is not contributing

Dies in warrior*

I'm going to MC tommorow, hope I'll be as lucky as you.
---
They won't stop because they see the world black &amp; white. They also won't achieve anything with this childish attitude "I'll show them, they won't get those 13 USD per month from me ever again!" but it doesn't matter, they'll show blizzard. Anything else would require some reasonable thinking.
---
Then that's it, you lose, good day sir.
---
Not for EU apparently. They had it after 1 week.
---
Apparently.
---
You are entirely missing the point.
---
1500g for a belt?! Hahahahahahaha
---
Yet double, triple, quadruple the resources. Because there are double, triple, quadruple the number of environments. 
---
ITT: people that think people magically create things, instead of getting them from an environment.

FYI: The supply is the environment, the sellers are just the middlemen.
---
I've cancelled my subscription today.
---
Can’t wait to get mine again. Our guild is finally starting MC tonight. Downed Ony for the first time yesterday with only 26 people.
---
So crazy.
---
Took me many, many runs to get the staff and now.  Now people have it in a month :(
---
Congrats!
---
I stopped my subscription this morning. I support Hpng Kong.

This guy gets it
---
This is at the top of every other Blizz related sub, except for /r/WoW. I'm wondering if the mods there are removing any posts about it.
---
*and* they took his prize money back.
---
"We". Fuck off with your bullshit forcing your opinion onto everyone else. 
---
People shouldnt break rules, if you do: take the consequences like a real man instead of whining kids that didnt get their way.
---
It could have and should have been a slap on the wrist punishment.
---
The actual print size is 48x36. You could open the file/image in any standard image viewer and print it, but don’t scale the image. It should print out on an 8-1/2”x11” at the actual size/scale and then you’d know if it were large enough. I had done test prints like this it the font was large enough to read.
---
A mod saw my original post and just said that I had to add a flair thou
---
Not as good as they used to be in Vanilla. Most WoW Classic players are over 18 years old.
---
What is there to do after a week at 60? You can run scholo and strat a few times and go through the raids in a PUG. What else is there ? There isn't really a point in min maxing your character if you can clear raids in 30 man PUGs. I'm not trying to sound elitist here I'm just genuinely wondering what to do with my character except wait for the next phases.
---
&gt; I had to put a shirt on to take the pic or it'd be kinda nsfw

Lmao. Lookin good still!

Thanks for the info, i'll try that add-on out tonight. :)

Take care and hope you get many more purples, ally scum! &lt;3
---
I just got back from a few months abroad and can finally start playing Classic. I've been living vicariously through this sub and Twitch (inb4 asmon layer) and have a few questions.
---
\- Are servers just as crowded in terms of queues and whatnot as they were the first few weeks?
---
\- How are the new servers that they ended up opening holding up?
---
\- Is it "too late"? I figure even most non hardcore people are 50+ by this point so I'm not sure if I'll just be getting corpse camped by 60s and have trouble finding groups at this point.
---
Melees in my guild aren’t allowed to be HoT’d only pets and ranged
---
You can't be communist if you have private owned companies and private investors. 
---
The only (basic) thing communism is about is who owns the means of production (the people, in case of the original idea of communism).
---
What a hot take man.
---
You're such a brave man whining about BFA without having played retail for the last 10 years like most of this sub
---
Upvotes to the left!!
---
Nah, I think the current version where you can play fully classic or introduce better lighting/shadows/foliage works pretty well already.
---
I mean, if it required 0 time and 0 resources, sure. But in the real world, there are better things to spend time on that doing a graphics overhaul (SUBJECTIVE).
---
Buying a thing made in China is not the same as buying from a game company that goes out of their way to punish a player for voicing an opinion. Anyone who doesn't recognize that is just being a douche.
---
He wasn't removed or voicing a political opinion - he was removed for voicing a political opinion that the Chinese government disapproves of.  If his t-shirt was about Brexit, do you think anything would have happened?
---
Tbh you are MILES behind the curve. But that's fine. 
---
I've got a wife and newborn, so i'm playing way more than i thought i would get a chance to, and i'm still only 46.
---
There's loads of time.
---
Druids are good tanks in classic if you do it right. The key is to throw up HOTS on yourself  before pulling. It speeds everything up because it takes pressure off the healer and saves mana. I usually get a lot of praise and complements by the end of the dungeon. Though, main tanking raids as a Druid is where things become more difficult
---
Holy shit Who you are myml mum?
---
Well mages are over populated.
---
It shouldn't have been a punishment AT ALL.
---
Same here. Sometimes I'm absolutely hating the Alliance zones, quest lines, and NPC's, other times it's nice to do something a little different.
---
Went elemental at 38, I was the first in my group to 60 by a long shot. All the other shamans are still in their 50's an enhance struggling to get a new 2h.
---
What else can you do to a corporation of this size then ?  Boycott is the only power we have.  Boycott and protest.  I will choose with my wallet and never buy another blizzard game or service again.  I will also actively seek to inform my gaming circle to boycott blizzard games as well.
---
I'd main warlock if they had mages blink
---
Well, what about me, I leveled engineering to 300 to make your runs more relaxed because I can tank better, at the expense of additional gold each run. And as someone who also had skinning to 300 b4 chaning to engineering, I can tell you, it was much more easy and MUCH cheaper. 
---
2nd profession is enchanting since I run a lot of dungeons and can offer the group to DE items, altho I never get to keep them. Also never saw a DE say "hey lets roll for this item, I pay the winner the 60s the item is worth and keep the 4-5g shard to myself"
---
So, you have a moneymaking profession and the one time it helps the group your argument is that it should make more money for yourself?
---
Well, easiest thing is to state roll or not roll b4 the dungeon, and anyone who disagrees is free to leave.
---
Nice, looks like we're all starving for some health!
---
I think it was switched when they changed the architecture of the folders with BFA
---
Plz explain
---
Lol exactly...

This is a PRIME example of the evils of capitalism and like clockwork someone is trying to pawn it off somewhere else.
---
yes, u should have gotten 2nd wind like every other healer.  there are no other dps trinkets

Are there many quests in Western Plaguelands for a 54 Horde?

"Not taking a stance" is itself taking a stance
---
Is it likely Blizzard would ban/suspend my account if I spread awareness of Hong Kong’s protests in trade chat? I know they just fired two castors and DQ’d a player in hearthstone.
---
Got a blue from a chest in the centaur cave in 1k needles. Couldn't even sell it on the auction house and ended up vendoring it. Feels bad.

It's called sticky keys

This news is depressing af, this might be the final straw, literally unacceptable.
---
Yes, Alibaba and Tencent.  Classic communist companies.
---
I am not saying that the ignore function doesnt have it purpose or should be removed. I am saying that the first instinct a person has to is to put a person on ignore is though. Even for the most heavy antisocial player to think that a person sends me a tell so I feel I have to put them on my ignore list when they arent being rude is something that people shouldnt defend. Just like the people who go insane and threaten people in video games there is a level of community respect that I believe should occur.
---
Ultimately people can do what they want, but to normalize the certain behavior is just going to make the community even worse in the long run.
---
Me too, but in the end back in vanilla I was still leveling when Naxx came out, and it only gave me more reasons to play and have fun...so I don’t see faster content as being necessarily detrimental to my experience.
---
If you come to OSRS join the CC “Surg1n” once you hit the level / get members (if you decide to) - We’re super helpful + if you look up his YouTube videos he has a lot of guides for bossing and whatnot. 
---
It’s a fun game but you gotta give it some time so you can learn the game and see what it has to offer. 
---
Hope you like it if you decide to play brother.
---
Your not supposed to walk into wetlands at 20 and come out at 30 its a zone that has quests that range from 20-30 and your meant to use the other 20 zones to keep you in the loop of quests So essentially you do some in duskwood when they get too hard go to wetlands and then when they get to too hard go back to duskwood because you will have leveled a couple of times. Its nota simple come here at 20 and leave at 30 like retail is.
---
Haha bye, won't miss you
---
Yeah so- you had to play at least 40 hours/week to get to 60 while also having a full-timer.  that's my point, I assume you had to have played at least that much right?
---
Just be more patient. Guarantee that's your issue. Locks aren't just inherently stupid, sorry to disappoint.
---
As a lock with Drain Life talents, I extend my hatred for these scumbags.
---
&gt;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion...damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms. 
---
You missed parts
---
Clearly the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a Democratic Republic, right? You're extremely intelligent, friend.
---
Yeah, I remember DM:E being great for WLs. Enslaving the satyrs etc.
---
Really depends on how locked down your computer is.
---
Normally you would just install to custom location, and choose the USB drive to install both blizzard and Wow.
---
However that install and activity could show up on their logs and software audits.
---
You could use an bootable usb drive, with your own install of Windows/Linux installed there, and then Wow installed on top of that.
---
You would need access to the bios to set your boot preference to boot off the USB before internal Harddrive.
---
This is Ideal when your taking your laptop out of town for work, and want to use the laptop for personal use during not work hours. Keeps work use and personal use of laptop seperate, and if your really paranoid, you can simply not mount the internal harddrive on the USB install.
---
&gt; Blizzard is taking no stance on the current Hong Kong situation.
---
They dont need to come out and make a statement to have a stance.
---
They take a stance with their actions.
---
This isn’t being neutral.
---
Byeee
---
Just don’t forget Gravestone Scepter
---
Spend it on gametime if you already arent
---
They're just greedy fucks.
---
Exactly the same as locked chests in dungeons. If there's a rogue and noone else who can open it, it's rogue's loot.
---
Pretty much the reason I had to install Questie. Horde quests I know backwards and forwards from playing so many alts, but I'm lost with most of the Alliance quests. I just got to Wetlands and it's so strange not knowing where to go, or having to verify quests are doable at my level since there are a lot of elite quests.
---
And North Korea is a democratic people's r e public too huh
---
Dude should have kept his mouth shut and just played the damn game.
---
It's like that 49ers dude who was kneeling during the games. Like, we're not watching you for your political stances or ideological causes; we want to watch the damn game. 
---
When will folks realize we play these games to escape the world, not have it follow us.
---
Because it's not worth the hassle to roll over drops which go for a few silver.
---
It's the same reason why purple BoE's often are rolled differently than the rest of the loot.
---
r/chinareddits
---
This is fucking outrageous. Fuck Blizzard the money hungry shit lords
---
I usually took a rogue in my groups for sap/lockpicking and good single target dps. But also because I'm a greedy loot-hungry warlock
---
Fuck anyone supporting them? I'm not supporting them but I do play the game. However if you are going to take a stance like that I hope you stop buying anything from China ever or you would be a MASSIVE hypocrite
---
No they're very much staying neutral. Where the fuck do you see communist propoganda. Lmfao.
---
Of course they are.  The mods here are terrible.
---
But the point I'm making is that Warlocks don't need to drink, an average Warlock should be able to sustain their mana and health in a near perfect limbo.
---
A good Warlock will always be in a mana/health surplus.
---
If the group is largely composed of casters and the dungeon has to stop after most pulls to drink then sure, the Warlock might as well drink. But a Warlock should be able to consistently continue with pulls whilst the Healer drinks, if necessary.
---
As I mentioned previously, if a Warlock is tapping down to sub 30% health and is not using Cannibalize, Healthstone, Bandage, Health Potion or on use heals then don't heal them as they're being a lazy Lock. But don't use linen bandages on a Warlock because they're not drinking, that's counterintuitive to your argument.
---
Yes, it's in the game. One of our hunters has the recipe.
---
Blizzard has been complying with China's government demands for years to retain access to thier market. You wait until now to quit
---
China is socialist.
---
Free healthcare and education, strict regulation or direct ownership of business. Inclusivity and egalitarianism.
---
Liz Warren’s beau ideal.
---
You are free to hop on a plane to Hong Kong and help.
---
I’ve been playing since LBRS was 10 man and didn’t know this, or the shift tab to tab back function. Thank you strangers.

Metallica made a song about a boss Stratholme? Years before WoW release?

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dezmzc/people_are_seriously_going_to_stop_supporting_the/). 
---
You're not understanding the gravity of the situation then. Blizzard aligns itself with it's best money-making interests, which in this case, happen to be authoritarians. They banned this player for saying something against the grain of the Chinese government.
---
It can happen in Europe, North America, South America in the same ways.
---
Really want to stick with the current healthcare system, huh?
---
Haven't played a hunter yet in Classic but i'm sure you can check his exp in the Pet tab. Also might be that you need to kill level-appropriate mobs for your pet to get exp.
---
Druids, shamans and paladins also want things like HoJ
---
I'm not sure how I feel about it personally, but I see why people might be concerned. Again, the issue isn't max level characters having an advantage, it's them having a potentially huge advantage before a large portion of the population is max level.
---
This is a scandal.
---
I was lucky I've done 2 armory runs and 1 cath run got the helmet and ravager straight away. Just need the shoulders and I'm set
---
Nah
---
Activision blizzard is legally required to act in the interests of their shareholders. That means profits above all else. Of course, until they decide to sacrifice their collective billions (42.5b mkt cap) in the name of human rights.
---
Throwing out people who talk about this is talking a stance. A stance against Hong Kong.
---
They could just say that it's the players private view and they have nothing to do with it. They instead choose to delete all footage they could and fire everyone related. It's precisely taking a stance against the protests.
---
Except (in vanilla/classic) there's no direct means of transportation between the 2.  Which makes it more like Darn.  Because UC/Org are linked via Zeppling, IMO.
---
Yeah, like i sayd, never got a blue from chests after lvl 50..
---
Before that i got 2-3.. But since my realm economy sucked i also vendored it... Fellsbadman
---
Shout "Liberate Hong Kong!" at Blizzcon please.
---
So you support a regime that has murdered millions. Plenty of TV's made in the U.S. and or assembled in the U.S., communist moron. 90% of the electronics made in China have been black listed as either being black market knockoffs or flat out dangerous fakes, and prime U.S. manufactures won't touch that crap, along with a majority of it being flat out banned from being imported into the U.S. Anything you name from China can be made else where at a higher quality than that Chicom crap...
---
TV's made in the U.S. and or countries better than China
---
Olevia -   U.S. based company  
---
Silo Digital - owned and operated in California 
---
Phillips Magnavox -  Phillips Magnavox is company owned in the Netherlands 
---
Panasonic -  Panasonic is based in Japan, but has manufacturing plants in Malaysia, the U.S. 
---
Vizio - California-based company 
---
Sharp -  based in New Jersey 
---
Toshiba -  Japan-based company, the TV manufacturer assembles some televisions models in the U.S.
---
Bruh heal them in combat if they have aggro, just don't heal them if they're at 1% before a pull. They'll eat or bandage 99.99% or the time unless they're completely braindead.
---
And their actions show they want no part of this.
---
And the point of blacking out your name is...?
---
Because changing a skeleton to a wraith is the EXACT SAME THING as banning someone and stealing their prize money
---
Also very lucky as we went with 3 warriors who all needed the ravager
---
Its outrage culture. Overreacting in one instance to compensate for all the blind eyes they turn.
---
The incompetence of Blizzard in the past couple years is actually scary.  And I used to defend them with brute force.  Now, in good conscience, I cannot recommend them.
---
Roommate canceled his sub already. Wish I had that sort of restraint.
---
Not sure. If you and the healer are running healbot or healcomm, it will show you incoming heals tho.
---
What did China do that's so bad that they are protesting why should I care
---
Next time I log in I will send it over. Basically depending on modifiers shift/alt/etc you can call pet, dismiss pet, revive pet, mend pet, or feed pet all with one button.
---
You can play wow from your phone? Clearly not an iPhone haha.
---
Think I’ll cancel my subscription for now. This left a sour taste in my mouth.
---
At low levels +22 int would make a FAR bigger difference. You'd have basically infinite mana.
---
mods are gay
---
Very helpful thanks for posting.  As a tank this will really help.
---
How about you keep that to yourself then?  Otherwise, you're just going out of your way to be a dick to them.
---
Amazing drawing. How do you create something like that?
---
What the fuck are you talking about?  You realize this is about Blizzard banning a hearthstone pro over supporting Hong Kong protests, right?
---
You should always tip your mage for portals, preferably more than the cost of the reagent, but acting like you should lump in their leveling time with the "cost" of them doing anything is a bit ridiculous.
---
They didn't level to make you a portal or a stack of water. They leveled to have fun playing the game. There's a big difference between taking a few seconds to help someone you're in a group with with food/water since you bring that to the party as part of your class, or to open a portal for someone who is tipping you (and thus you're getting money).
---
For the people who don't tip, screw them. :)
---
Doesn’t change the fact that you aren’t entitled to anyone else’s gold. Pay up or shut up if you want a port.
---
Man you make a lot of assumptions lol
---
Wow blizzard in politics now, gtfo our blizzard.
---
yeah except thats not what happened.
---
We had a pug shaman that tried needing an Orb of Deception, then the epic warlock tailoring recipe because “someone in his guild needed it”
---
You're banned, now i'm banned for saying you're gonna get banned, we're all banned for seeing this.
---
Getting? :)
---
I hear you, but we are way past getting, we've been deeply entrenched into ridiculous for so long it seems normal to too many players, if you can call people who watch games play themselves players.
---
Playing with your credit card is not gaming.
---
Wow I didn’t know Blizzard supports fascist nations. Only thing they care about is fucking money
---
The only reason you even have the ability to pretend the real world doesnt exist is that there are people who don't hide from the inconvenient. This person just gave up (without regrets) their career to bring what will now be a ton of attention to the issue. Sorry you had to see a 10 second blip and read some forum posts. Woah is you.
---
So we just need to bend to the will of a totalitarian regime and adjust our Western Civilization's expectations...because Capitalism. 
---
The religion of the "free market" is going to kill off Western values.
---
You should be able to pick up "call to arms the plaguelands" quest that will take you to the bulwark where you'll find some wpl quests.  There's a few more to find while you're in the zone itself.  It'll lead you to epl after you've completed a chain in wpl.
---
I forget where to pick up call to arms, one of the major cities...
---
Damn that sounds like a shitty company or they were looking for any excuse to fire you. 
---
I had FFXIV installed on my work laptop just to see if it could run it. It was hilariously bad. I forgot to uninstall it and a few weeks later they kindly asked me to remove it. No hassle given. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah definitely a misunderstanding but ultimately started from me assuming. Hopefully I can get real answers from people when I ask questions. Thanks.
---
Human freedoms &gt; corporate profits
---
I tried to dumb it down as much as possible for you. I’m sure it still won’t compute.
---
&gt; Fuck anyone here supporting them too
---
where else am i gonna get them cheap organs from ?
---
good question actually, i think it should.
---
For what? Not witch hunting Blizzard? For understanding the corporate world? I did not once say I didn't sympathize with the hearthstone pro in question. I 100% agree with what he did. I 100% support his decision and actions and believe much much more needs to be done. However, Blizzard is a cooperate entity that cannot side with individual opinions and this man clearly had broken his contract with his actions.
---
Unplayable characters are unplayable whether they vendor their gear or not.
---
Damn, they got everyone by the sack.
---
Anyone kept up on the private server scene? They have official data now and better scripting and better servers for large scale PvP.
---
Gonna research a new one and cancel my sub
---
The batching is fucking shitty anyways and they aren't changing it
---
Why does that matter?
---
Sure? They're a socialist state that (on paper) holds elections. Abeit authoritarian. What makes the Chinese Communist Party not communist?
---
That's right my dude.....build the army and then buy them computers.
---
I rerolled on classic at lvl 39 for the same reason. I have most fun roleplaying because of the social aspects of it.
---
Who's worked up?
---
He's just using a shitty excuse to be anti social, selfish mind set.
---
I mean it _is_ widely recognized to be  a shit move if you just take a chest. But most decent people would accept your expanation and apology. It's not that you can't roll for that stuff anymore once somebody has looted it.
---
Can I have your gold?

Second Wind + Briarwood Reed is BiS for (I believe) all healing classes. At least for priest it is.

It was a soft-reserve run, so every other dps had the exact same chance of putting in BRE for their softres :)
---
Since when are corporations shining stars of virtue ?  
---
Of course they want to make money, are we all going to pretend that's not the main goal of any big company ? Is everyone living in their own utopia lately ?
---
Thats the most retarded part. Makes sense they dont want politics in esport, but he earned that money
---
it's really hard to break out of a specific mindset or habit once it's been formed.  
---
This kind of behavior was pretty rare back in the day, but because contemporary gaming (and society in general) has conditioned us to think and act in the way portrayed, it's going to be par for the course.
---
Shooting protesters for wanting democracy, rounding up religious and ethnic minorities to place into ~~concentration~~ education camps, etc.
---
Just normal fascist government stuff.

Just hilarious how all these corporations are getting exposed for being fake woke

STV during populated hours is kind of a death trap or a gridlock with your own faction but yeah, any peace will cease haha

What does your talent build look like?
---
Everything bad is capitalist. Everything good is socialist. This is Reddit.
---
Hunter - ranged damage dealer. Uses bows, crossbows and guns. You get to tame a pet from level 10 to be your personal tank - very easy leveling experience with the only annoying aspects being that you have to buy ammo from vendors and food for your pet. 
---
Rogue - stealthed melee damage dealer. Uses daggers, swords etc. Bit of a slow leveler due to taking damage a lot and needing to heal up. Very good for pvp as you can pick favourable battles with stealth and there is a lot of scope to control your opponent with stuns and slows. 
---
Any class can learn alchemy to make potions, elixirs and flasks. Best paired with herbalism so you can gather the materials needed for alchemy yourself.
---
About time... been clearing MC and Ony for weeks already. They are going to have to go OSRS with classic to keep the hard cores interested.
---
I can't tell if this is trolling, but this is terrible advice. Maybe sometimes its worth it to pull 2 and melee one while you range the other but unless you're a geared 60 farming particularly week level 50 mobs it's never efficient at all to have more than 2.
---
Good way to lose the majority of your player base.
---
I remember back in Vanilla the honor system just came out and my hunter was not even 60 yet so I bought underwater breathing potions and planned to grind under water to evade any horde looking to gank me for honor. 
---
So there I was farming them naga and killed that Prince and his Tidal Charm dropped. I thought it was okay at the time but didn't really use it all that much cuz I was a noob. 
---
Now I know better.
---
Try and kill some level-appropriate enemies and see if that speeds up. I think characters get a lot of reduced exp if the mob is skull, might be the same for pets.
---
Hmmm it might be able to work actually, I'll give it a shot ty.
---
Pathetic, blizzard = china's lappdog
---
And we are because people turn a blind eye, only to compensate by being completely outraged at a minor event. THIS right here is where you draw the line? Censorship during an esports event? How many of these people that act outraged right hace ever protested against human right violations? Way worse stuff that happens every single day?

This fucking hypocrisy makes me sick

I went fishing. :) Also trying to farm specific tailoring recipes. Start some alts. Do PvP (when BGs are finally available). Max Cooking. Help friends. Make money. Farm rep. Prepare for the next phase. Just enjoy the game while playing with friends. 
---
I mean, if you are only in for new gear Classic is a tough choice. The content is limited. Your only option will be to run the same Raids over and over again until BWL opens in - 6 months.
---
Wondering how many people are actually wondering about this
---
I appreciate you.  Virtue signaling as an idea is the dumbest shit ever.  Whenever someone says that I always wonder if it's lost on them that they're doing exactly the same thing, just appealing to people with different "virtues".  It's super cool to not care right now.
---
For being an apologist.
---
yea you guys are frkn screwed
---
Me too. Adios.
---
Can't be. It never got polled
---
They're seizing an independent nation and imposing military force on its citizens. Someone playing Hearthstone spoke in support for the resistance and was banned. The reason you should care is because it has large ramifications among all people who play Blizzard games. If you're American and you speak out about the government on a Blizzard platform, could you be banned? Would a European speaking negatively about the EU be banned? 
---
This is a clear-cut case of this company siding with a authoritarian government for the sake of good PR and money.
---
You mean, people are spamming a subject and mods are cleaning up that spam.  How dare they!!!

This is objectively so far off the mark it's insane. You're letting your own delusions bias you into believing this. "I thought this was ugly and bad, I've heard a couple of people that agree with me, therefore I'm right". TBC is by far and large some of the most success this game has ever had, period.

Uh even if you used a shadow bolt after your pet has agro you will be ripping it off with a single shadow bolt. I do like that idea though.

If you know what to fish for and where to fish, you will make money.  I used fishing almost exclusively for money making.  You don't really get to a point where you can make money fishing until you have 225 fishing (and a +5 pole and +75 lures), but I hit that at level 21 and by the time I was level 30 had 80g.  When I hit level 40 I had 170g after sending about 25 to friends.  I am now 42 and have amount and have sent 130g to my wife and daughter to help pay for their mounts as well (I was spending time fishing so as not to outpace them w/ leveling).  I also procured 4 journeymans backpacks via fishing (like direct catches - not buying them off AH with fishing profits).
---
You can \_definitely\_ make bank fishing - I rake in about 10-15g per hour depending on RNG, and that's just not possible to do in other ways in your 20s and 30s without depending on other players' help and/or significantly more stress/luck.  In about 3-4 levels, I'll be moving fishing locations and will begin catching things that currently sell for \~7g each on my server and should be able to make &gt;20g/hr.  There are a lot of guides online that will tell you how to make money fishing.  Most of them don't have \_all\_ the info, but they'll get you started.  Hint:  The money is almost never in the fish you catch.  It's in bolts of runecloth and mageweave, thick and rugged leather,  green level 35-45 BOEs, green recipes, etc. all of which can be caught.

A warrior in our guild got ironfoe and savage glad chest first try,

wasn’t even level 60 at that time? But he doesn’t need sgc bcoz he wants to go mitigation tank. So lucky lol
---
Can you send me your gold? My bank alt is Bankdank on Pagle.
---
Can someone explain like I’m 5 why releasing Dire Maul now is a bad idea? 
---
I’m new to vanilla wow and I’m still mid 30s in terms of leveling. From what I gathered from some research, it’s a 44-54 dungeon. That seems fairly innocent, so why is everyone saying it’s too soon? Is it not just another dungeon to do as you make your way to max level?
---
Based
---
There is a sticky now.l
---
100 canceling its a shame, but this is gross
---
People are saying its too soon but the whole classic experiment seems to be more geared towards streamers which indirectly creates more publicity for wow/retail in general. I have zero doubt that streamers complaining about running out of stuff to so influenced this release.
---
I just cancelled my WoW Classic subscription in protest.
---
Okay
---
The Inn-maxing we need.
---
Holy shit that’s some enlightened centrism right there.
---
‘I don’t care about other people who are fucked by the system, I just want to watch (e)sports and play my games’
---
The way it should be.
---
No. In the EU (and most likely also the US) this all belongs to freedom of speech. Blizzard can't Limit this without a law. As a company they can't make laws.
---
no
---
lmao their account is 7 and a half years old
---
Some people won’t know the honor difference, others won’t care. The people who kill gray leveled players could just kill the 48-51 range all the same and get the same odd rush they already get while also getting honor.

Egalitarianism is how you get to totalitarianism. Every detail of social and business interaction has to be policed to maintain everyone having equal outcomes, wealth, opportunity.

I mostly agree with you, but the national anthem is inherently political. It shouldn't have been part of the game to begin with.

Improved cleave is not good, wouldn’t use that spec.
---
Its easy to piss on blizz for this but if they go against china their games may be banned like many others. Im sure were talking billions here. Would you be a justice warrior if it cost you billions and made you fire hundred of employees due to the lower revenue? Or who knows.. perhaps even close down.
---
We definitely need a solution to the dictatorship of china affecting the world vs capitalism
---
Capitalism dies without free flow of products and information. What these corporations are supporting is not Capitalism, it's Oligarchy.
---
I don't understand why you witch hunt Blizzard and not the Chinese government? If anyone is an apologist it is yourself.
---
I am level 2 because I have so little time to play. Only 15 minutes every other day. I really hoped they would delay phase 2 until 2030.
---
How far post 40?
---
Shame
---
What is the point of this post?
---
The undo-delete button :)
---
I'd almost go as far as to say that censoring this is in itself in support of horrible practices and should be viewed as such by anyone in an authoritative position over the subreddit mods.
---
I canceled my subscription. I wont support Chinese influence into limiting my freedoms which is just what allowing them to do this without consequence would lead to.
---
And the Hawaiian Coup was in 1899. I'm sorry I didn't say 100+/- 35 years.

I am aware of Dole's horrific abuses. I'm just saying that boycotting bananas in 2019 isn't going to free Hawaii or Guatemala. I am criticizing your use of "whataboutism" and goal-post moving when you ask "Further I don’t see any of you complaining about the way Dole Fruit ... Peak western outrage hypocrisy in this thread."
---
&gt; Cancelling your account with blizzard is a stupid ass hill to die on. Resist the systemic forces at play if you’re gonna do anything.
---
I disagree here, mostly because you frame this issue as either-or. It’s not.
---
You can fight the systematic forces at play while still allowing the actions of companies to influence your purchasing decisions.
---
If you are disgusted by the decisions and actions of a company, then don’t support them. Or at the very least, support them less. At the same time, you can involve yourself politically to fight the established system if that’s something you care about.
---
You can gain a lot of exp if you get a good group and farm SM, at the same time you get a lot of gold. I went from 50g to 92g running sm:Cath from 37.5-39.25. a green 2h mace with shitty stats vendors for 1.5g.
---
I came out with 10 greens that were AH-worthy stats wise but once I hit 92g from vendoring I decided to send all the good greens to guildies.
---
Desolace where the nagas are, bottom of the lake has dozens of footlockers that contain some copper and spawn often. You can level up there  up to 200 i believe.
---
This, 100%.
---
This is true, South shore quests are early-mid 30s
---
How is this relevant? They're using Patch 1.12 or 1.13, we have none of the original bugs, none of the original talent trees before they were revamped. Was really hoping to see endless WF proc shamans.
---
Actually based.
---
Correct. Instead just /spit
---
I'll take "What is an ironic and pathetic excuse for a response on the internet for $200"
---
Except it's a good argument and you're just completely ignoring the context.
---
You're equating the censorship put forth by a fascist totalitarian government to censoring certain parts of media for understandable cultural reasons.
---
Germany isn't a fan of swastikas for good reasons, so games and movies release there will often censor them, or just not release there, this isn't even close to the same thing as what China is doing right now.
---
Lmao this guy thinks he's Marx himself
---
I didn't even read the post correctly.... Thought it was about using the tab button to cycle through enemies.
---
I've deleted my post since I'm basically an idiot.
---
They both need them, but instead of keeping up time on them like cats, the bear just needs to pop 1 charge on a target and that will build up threat for days
---
That's what happens when you elevate craven sycophants to mods.
---
It depends on your IT department. I will say that Netflix/hulu websites are harder to detect then a game via usb (still not difficult) I get an email if someone plugs in a USB. If they allow USB's you might be fine. 
---
There is a big big difference from playing an mmo/game at work than watching netflix/hulu/etc. I'm not going to tell you not to do it, but if I see a thread about someone crying because they were fired for playing a video game at work I won't feel the slightest bit sorry for them. If you need to play that bad that you have to find a way around work to play there might be a potential issue.
---
Nope. Personally I have more respect for blizzard now. I'm tired of companies taking political stances on things regardless of what the issue is.
---
? Then why do i remember tabbing between mobs in vanilla?
---
You're getting emotional about a company and it's platform. They are remaining neutral by not allowing any political statements to be shared on their platform. If someone came on and said America sucks, china number 1, hong kong revolution wont work blah blah I'm sure that guy would get banned too. Would you be ok with that guy being banned and not this guy?
---
Warrior: Manhandle - You grab the Target with your OffHand and hold them in place for (3,4,5,6,8, increases by a talent)  seconds or until the target presses jump enough times to break the hold. The amount of jumps it takes is lessened by the Targets strength stat and relative level difference. (also has macro protection to prevent any cheesing)
---
While manhandling the target, you can use any abilities that do not require use of the OffHand. If the target does not break the hold before the duration is up or if the target dies while being manhandled, the cooldown is reset.
---
Non-Player mobs will have AI that attempts to break the hold.
---
Cooldown: 5 Min.
---
You dumbass. The clause essentially allows them to do this to ANYONE who holds a dissenting opinion. You better be a good little boy and just follow the rules if you want your $, right?
---
not even new, you could see on previous versions of details as well, by hovering the class icon in the dmg meter. I don't mind, I don't really care that much about the specs of ppl at this point, and I barely every inspect anyone. I guess it would be possible to disable this showing up when I'm inspecting someone else at least? If a guild would force members to use Details for raiding it would be because The tiny threat plugin for details is the best Threat addon I have found so far in classic and it got the upside of being baked into the dmg meter.
---
Jagex is owned by a Chinese company. So you’re going to save about $4 that’s about it.
---
&gt;Makes sense they dont want politics in esport,
---
Politics is in everything, and impossible to remove. Whether people want to ignore/wilfully ignore it is the issue.
---
There's far more people at 60 now than there were when dire maul came out in vanilla
---
Issue isn't the class, but itemization is lacking.
---
I'd have to dig up all the BiS stuff that drops, but we'll need green dragons.
---
Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age
---
I'm down for that. And get rid of the ads too.

Thank you for taking a reasonable stance on the issue
---
Tab swipe tab swipe tab..
---
But they *gained* from those politics.
---
Put it on passive and take it to dungeons with you
---
20? movement speed easily beats every other stat on boots until at least 40
---
Fellow DPS Warriors, have any of you stuck as Arms for the dungeon grind as a fresh high level? Obviously, with gear, Fury is going to beat out Arms, but I could see if you're looking to farm instances how Arms could be better thanks to SS and Whirlwind.
---
Opinions?
---
Leveling guides aren't focused on endgame raiding. They're focused on leveling quickly. As a result, you get guides like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/shaman-leveling-classic-wow) or [this](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/enhancement-shaman-leveling-guide-1-60).
---
If you're looking for a casual guide for someone who might not even dungeon at 60 then you're probably right, you can do whatever.
---
I understand that there are indeed zones that are designed for flying mounts. It just seems really cool. For me, that is the biggest difference between retail and wow classic. All the little details that you come across as you travel through the landscape en route for your quest. the game also feels much larger due to the long distances that you have to cover.
---
Feralas, Hinterlands, Ungoro, Searing Gorge
---
You are being ignored :)
---
Supporting Blizzard is supporting ethnic cleansing, human rights abuses and forced organ harvests.
---
You mean like Reddit? And their slow censorship of certain subs?
---
Agree or disagree with someones opinion. That's fine. Don't quarantine subs because they dissent from popular opinion. Straight up censorship.
---
Sure, I do. I'm just not crying about consequences those actions have.
---
Interrupts lock you out of the spell school of whatever spell got interrupted. Keep in mind that spell schools are not the same as specs (Discipline is not a spell school - most discipline spells are either Holy or Shadow). If the mage is spec’d into improved CS then you will be silenced from ALL spell schools for 4 seconds, on top of being locked out of the school that was interrupted for 6-8 (i forget the exact lockout duration). Or they can use Imp CS to just silence you for 4 seconds and not even use it as an interrupt. In that case it works exactly the same as your silence spell.
---
That's not how it works, if  someone is not getting involved that doesn't make them "for" whatever bad thing you're ranting about at any given time.. It makes them not involved.
---
That's not this situation though, banning a player instead of just parting ways behind the scenes is a pretty big 'not neutral' stance 
---
Unless, of course, part of the blizzard contract is to not use your professional social media to be a political influence... Then it's all in the clear
---
Then stop sitting on your ass and do it too?
---
I've done the same, but I was a Mage so I guess it didn't really m atter
---
Users are reporting being permanently banned from r/hearthstone for supporting Hong Kong.
---
Unlike many other subreddits which are buckling under the pressure, just like Blizzard!
---
I did mistake of not properly explaining - first person without AoE grinding.  
---
But why you are so toxic, and instead of correcting me - started with calling me a liar?
---
I wasn’t even talking to you haha you asked me to enlighten you on op of this thread was wrong... Sorry you don’t like the answer.
---
Yup, but most people seem to forget this as they share his views.
---
Pride has been hijacked to become a consumer holiday for big companies and not for gay people pride
---
It's been fun reliving the past with all of you guys, but [this is where I draw the line.](https://imgur.com/a/ATT8yZI) I encourage everyone else to consider canceling subscriptions today and include a reference to Hong Kong in your cancellation message. Even if you reactivate your subscription before your current time runs out, the cancellation today sends Blizz a message that they desperately need to hear.
---
I'm pretty sure they'll nerf solo tribute runs. It's been done on private servers and will most likely happen in classic because of how gamebreaking it is. Also it was only a hunter thing wasn't it?
---
&gt;	Will this happen to WoW?
---
Yes.
---
Get Glad
---
My mouse has 12 buttons too, wish it was a moose tho
---
How is that any different that the other countries?
---
Ya, who cares about human rights violations! Isn't anyone going to think of the profits!!
---
It is. But there are also better subreddits to discuss this than /r/classicwow, given that most of the replies here are shitting on a gaming company for not backing a controversial political stance, when they've specifically made a rule against political statements. I honestly feel like I'm the crazy one for trying to bring reason into the discussion.
---
Warlock life is getting whispered by 3 people when you are about to walk into the instance to help summon for other groups. One dude got really pissy when I said it'd be 1g to help. Listen dude your making my group wait cuz you want me to help you summon, least you can do is make it worth my time....
---
How do I know when a skill is ready to use? I've tried holding the button down when it's ready. Sometimes my character attacks and sometimes he just stands there getting pummeled.
---
Yeah, you're a loser.
---
That's how jobs work, yeah
---
Accurate.
---
Your analogy shows you don’t know the history of Hong Kong.. 
---
Strange that you would even use Germany as an example when the Soviet Union is far more apt. 
---
Every nation, except the USA, can and will punish or imprison people for speech that is deemed offensive to the government. You don’t protest that at all. I couldn’t care less about a city across the world (sort of) trying to break away from its nation.

Tbf whirlwind axe and bone biter are both better warrior weapons and easily attainable by the time you’re running armory
---
I regret rolling a Orc instead of a Night Elf. Orcs look like shit and Night Elfs look cool.
---
Tbh...
---
Fuck China
---
Depends _heavily_ on the group, and their levels. My guess would be 1.5h for Uldaman, 1-1.5h for ZF, 2h for Maurodon full (both wings and Princess), and 30m for Princess (might be more if you do Croc/Goblin).
---
3 each with custom abilities and about 10 shared abilities.
---
Also,
---
Instead of using your misguided altruism at cancelling a subscription to Blizzard thinking it is going to do a fucking thing to change the state of things in China, maybe donate to humans rights charities, email your local and state governments, and do something that could possibly make a difference.
---
It does. It also tells your to vendor the item if it is less value than putting it on the AH.
---
Is this serious? Really?   
---
Fuck this sub then. 
---
Anybody know a sub where its just Classic WoW and not political bullshit?
---
I though that OP was asking about solo grinding, because AoE grinding done in parties.  
---
And questing is better than solo grinding mobs.
---
That's such a gross misrepresentation that I'd almost accuse you of being a Chinese shill. Outrage culture = taking offense where there is none. Supporting a totalitarian genocidal regime is so, so far removed from "no offense" that it makes child labor seem like a good idea.
---
And druid tanks can't be uncrushable, which leads to surprise wipes, which is why they don't MT progression
---
You know, smart people would have waited until they got the $ and are no longer contracted THEN state their opinion...
---
Rightfully so
---
Come join us at /r/ffxiv

Japan has been War Crime free since the 1940s, and Yoshi P rocks :)

Yes fuck people for trying to do the right thing. Blizzard is basically supporting China in its atrocious actions by silencing this player.
---
Everyone should give their collective middle finger to China in the hopes that they might learn that behaviour like this is unacceptable. It probably doesn't help a lot, but it helps a lot more than doing nothing and looking the other way.

---
The main problem with each of these is that are heavily impacted by your group, but I'll assume a decent group that doesn't wipe based on my own experiences. Obviously any single wipe will increase these times by \~10 minutes each time. 
---
Uldaman - 2.5 hours
---
Zul'Farrak - 1.5 hours, UNLESS someone needs scarabs/wants to do graveyards. Then closer to 2-2.5
---
Maraudon - 3 hours
---
Maraudon Princess - 30 minutes
---
Keep in mind, I'd say these are relatively average. I once had a Maraudon group that took 3.5 hours and only got to the scepter before disbanding. Also had an Uldaman group get finished in about an hour once, but that group was one of the best I've had in any dungeon.
---
&gt; Opinions
---
Yes. Do you have one?
---
That's retarded, it's like saying I'm a hypocrite for caring about the environment but still drive a car. You can't be perfect but you can do something. If not supporting blizzard is your way of saying no its a hell a lot bettet then doing nothing.
---
It could be graphical/interface I guess I just dont know how to fix it ;/
---
&gt;so i gotta stop drinking in order to shield/heal them. 
---
Let them experience natural selection instead.
---
DM being released early won't be the end all, in fact, I actually prefer it now as we can get the major gold influx out of the way now and let the economy become a bit more stable. It might totally backfire but at least it isn't something like BWL coming out next week.
---
Ill put money on the fact this is nerfed and not possible

Do you buy any [Nestle products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands)? Because that means you support slavery.

Ashamed to say I'm also playing classic on a 2080ti, feels like bringing an armored Humvee with mounted minigun to a knife fight.

Does anyone have a link to a good/respectable tanking guide? 
---
My friends recently abandon the server I was on (for like the third time) and so I've decided to make a warrior/tank character to ensure I'm needed in a group. However, despite my years of playing this game (Vanilla through Cata, skipped Mists and WoD, then finished out with Legion and BfA), I've never played a warrior (I made a DK tank for Cata).
---
Just need a link that I can go to when I get home that has good pointers for speccing, what addons to use, gearing, et cetera. Thank you, in advance.
---
Complete RNG for me, leveling enhancement and love it, sometimes getting 2 WFs back to back and 3 shotting a mob 2 lvls higher, sometimes sitting there autoing no crits no procs for 30s
---
Sounds perfect!
---
WoW Classic feels like a world you have so figure out for yourself, fraught with danger, hardship and adversity. Very validating when you progress towards your goals, that you mostly set out for yourself. Classic rewards good communication, empathy and leadership. Classic makes you really feel like you earned something.
---
WoW Retails feels like a theme park. Candy being shoved in your face from left and right, a bunch of clowns asking you to come with them on their little tour, with mini-games within mini-games, all the while manipulatively compelling you to come back every day/week for THAT SPECIAL EVENT THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW LIMITED TIME ONLY^(tm). Does anything in this game really feel like an accomplishment?
---
Classic and Retail are completely different beasts with different reward mechanics and goals. Classic rewards self-accomplishment, Retail thrives on fear of missing out.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Usually, these paragraphs are used as last line of defense in case they wrongfully ban someone - it prevents them from getting dragged to court. So I am quite suprised it isn't part of the EU TOS.
---
I'm saying there is no clear contract violation and to claim that a contract violation is the only reason he was banned and had his earnings confiscated is wrong. Subjective values, interpretations and actions on the part of blizzard actors played large roles.
---
😂 I didn't expect you too but you gotta pretend you know what you're talking about. "I'm gonna make a mage so I can AOE farm to 60" tell him that and own it.
---
Screw that. Hate the player and the game. This was way too blatent an action to ignore. I stopped playing any blizz game for years back when guldans died after I saw how they treated their employees and what they were becoming. All their games. 
---
I only came back because old fiends joined classic and sc2. But I will be dropping those today. 
---
I'm not dieing in any hill. Blizz's games are not worth that much. I can discard them easily in the face of this despite being a longtime fan since wc3.
---
I don't understand why reddit mods feel obligated to do Blizzard's damage control for them.
---
When a high value item drops, the inner goblin comes out in everyone and therefore everyone will need regardless.
---
In all fairness to them though... Yes you're the only one able to use, and yes it may be an upgrade BUUUTTTT... That could be an excuse to ninja without competition, send to a bank alt and profit.
---
If I had the choice between a nice payday or a slight increase in stats/armour, I'd for sure choose the payday.
---
And this is why (imo) everyone needs.
---
Thats not the reason...

Undead priest :(

This is outrageous !
---
They found an execuse to steal the Grandmaster money from him ,scummy move didn't expected from blizzard seriously !
---
I'm sorry man, I played the fuck out of that expansion and have since then moved on and talked to a lot of players that have been active in a lot of mmorpgs and other e-sport games, casually and professionally, the vast majority have all been very positive about TBC, it is not an opinion that I convey simply cause I think it was a good expansion myself.
---
I've honestly never ever heard anyone be so negative toward TBC as you seem to be right now. But since I've been in contact with a lot of players and talked about TBC a lot I suppose it was bound to happen some time no matter how great of an expansion it was.

Done. Installed it all. Launcher too this time.
---
I mean, what´s nextg? banning players that support HK in game? in their Forums? Fuck Blizzard.
---
As soon as I get to the dungeon I start conjuring 3 stacks per mana user in the party. And I'll usually hand our healer a couple stacks of food as well. If I've just gotten to my next food level and it takes a long time to craft, I'll give non-healers a level down and give the healer the good stuff.
---
You’re a dumbass, then.
---
consider my sub gone i won't support blizz again this is bullshit
---
I do have standards and morals. But playing or not playing a game won’t change anything about the situation in Hong Kong. Blizzard isn’t responsible for what the Chinese government is doing. The U.N. would have to put a lot of pressure on China to accomplish anything, and I can say with certainty they won’t. But if it makes you feel better, don’t do business with any company that operates in China.
---
It's not like ore and herbs because they don't have a comparable chase item.

Yeah. That moonkin is me. I'm an ass.

Thinking if you can't boycott everything bad you shouldn't boycott anything is narrow minded. You can start somewhere and still make a difference.
---
We not only need to put pressure on companies, but on the governments of the world to call out China for what they do.
---
If Blizzard did not censor this guy's comments, the Chinese would ban all Blizzard products, then completely rip off the IP and sell their own version to their population. They have no respect for Intellectual Property rights, and its getting out of control.
---
Not defending Blizzard's actions, but there needs to be pressure on the rest of the world to not put up with China's shit anymore.
---
THIS is how you handle shit.  Kudos to the mod team.
---
? It's not a 0.01% efficiency increase. For how good briarwood reed is for DPS, it is equally as good for healers. There is basically no other choice for trinkets as healers. By your reasoning, you are also denying your healer of an entire trinket slot. The alternative would be like Eye of the Beast (which I believe is better for DPS than it is for healers).  
---
Basically every clothie is going to need that trinket. Its annoying that there aren't more options but that's just how it is.
---
China wouldn't push to stop the LGBTBBQ community in the United States because that "community" is detrimental to any nation it's allowed to thrive in.
---
no one in the US gives a shit about that game or ever will
---
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRReeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Thank you for this comment. Good to see there are people thinking outside their little political bubble and try to see another side of this mess.
---
It is, especially in Spanish. Isn’t surprising that we have trolls in this thread.
---
Proof?
---
That’s funny how you got
---
&gt; Why don't you just throw your garbage on the ground? Everyone does it, do you think that a handful of people not throwing garbage on the floor will solve the problem?
---
From
---
&gt;Cancelling your account with blizzard is a stupid ass hill to die on. Resist the systemic forces at play if you’re gonna do anything.
---
Interesting how my suggesting of alternatives is conflated with telling someone appropriately throwing trash away to “throwing it on the ground.” My suggestion was more akin to telling you to throw it in the appropriate receptacle for whatever category of garbage it is, hope that clears things up.
---
Unless they completely redesign all the classes and world entitlements I have zero interest in anything connected to Welfare WoW.
---
Personally I prefer tips and a lower wage, but I'm a bartender. I can clear $200-$300 (£165-£245) cash on a weekend night in tips alone.
---
Plus, and many people do not realize this, we have a law that says if your tips do not add up to the regular minimum wage, your employer must make up the difference.
---
Say minimum wage is $10/hr and you work 10 hours. But with tips and wages you only end up making $90 for that shift. Your employer legally must pay you out the extra $10 to hit minimum wage.
---
They are but it's like he didnt even read his original message thoroughly...
---
So... can I have your gold or nah?
---
In pvp we kited so getting a hit in is already difficult.
---
Only overpower has a high chance to crit and that depends on a dodge.
---
If you got crit twice in a row by a warrior, you got unlucky or he had recklessness on.
---
What really happens is someone undercuts by just enough to make it not profitable to flip (due to deposit/cut), then someone else does the same, and you quickly end up with a much lower price and no way to "fix" that.
---
No, it's that if they release this early, what other dungeons/raids will they release early? It will make it impossible to keep up.
---
There is no reason whatsoever to need to know the sexuality of a character in a child’s game.  They were signaling how progressive they are.
---
I just did my first MC raid.. they need to slow this content down
---
^[*citation needed*]
---
It's how China operates. If you want to do business in China either it must be done through a Chinese company or you must let a Chinese company have a stake in yours.
---
i said I like them, not they like me
---
dont conflate making the game playable with actually making the game easier.   this has nothing to do with making the game easier but making a portion of the game actually playable.
---
I'm the dps giving tank armor pots and scrolls and always the one giving out free water to warlocks/priests. 
---
Idk why I got downvoted anyways this sub is getting lame.
---
Business handling doesn't exist independently of political context. The structures that allow corporations to amass economic power are political. Blitzchung's statement forced Blizzard to react, but they still have to own the political consequences of their reaction.
---
I'm pretty sure oriental is a geopgraphical direction too. Like spetentrional.
---
Redoubt Cloak isn't an upgrade to you? Curious what you're using instead. Tarnished Elven Rings are quite good as well.
---
There's also Timeworn Mace and Quel'serrar. And some PvP-oriented items.
---
DM is mostly about healer gear, so you indirectly benefit from that. I have a nearly prebis Shaman and DM has like 6-7 items that I need.
---
They didn't say they were going to stop using Chinese products. They said they were going to stop supporting Blizzard. It would be hypocritical of they continued to support Blizzard and called out people for doing so.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMe00xZhfZA0es0hos](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMe00xZhfZA0es0hos)  I'm leveling with something like this in mind for 60. Straight down the Subtlety tree until Hemo, then into the Assassination tree, combat tree, then finally finish up the Subtlety tree. Big crits, lots of burst damage, far less boring than combat swords, and it's better for being a sneaky boi.  
---
Hemo's a much better combo points generator than SS, for when you can't backstab.
---
Each pull for a raid is easily 4g on mana pots alone. More if the fight lasts more than 2 min. Healers are hit the hardest by consumables by far. It isn't even close.
---
the nets didn't call Hong Kong a separatist movement, the owner Joe Tsai did. the NBA didn't force Morey (the man who made the tweet) to delete the tweet, that's purely speculation. if anyone forced him to delete the comment it would probably have been the rockets owner Tilman Fertitta.
---
Random dudes will give you stuff though. Mostly junk but still. Randos were always coming and giving me weird shit or money or gear whenever I was playing a human female Rogue in BC or a human female Paladin in WotLK/Cata/MoP to gank my friends and guildies with.
---
TFW everyone called me crazy for still playing on a private classic wow server.
---
Blizzard is bowing to authoritarianism dude. The "consequences" argument is a fallacy. Everything has consequences and everyone should stand up to what China is doing. The faster we tell them no the better. 
---
What good is freedom if you're afraid to use it?
---
Depends on where you stand. I'm French, and while I may say that Ukraine is an eastern country, it isn't an oriental country though. While an oriental country is an eastern country, the opposite is not always true.
---
Came here hoping for a useful guide.  Using my ignore button instead.
---
BOE Wands until 38 will help a lot (google “wand progression”), at 38 onward drain is better and 40 onward with Dark Pact drainlife is super clutch.
---
yeah this is seriously making me think about canceling my sub. I have been really enjoying classic but this is so not ok. Guess Archeage unchained is releasing at the perfect time after all.
---
i think id rather just let china take over then have anything to do with twitch chat
---
To the extent you are correct I agree about egalitarianism.
---
For us, it is just a game.  For them, games is their financial lifeblood.  Good call.
---
50 silver is what I expect for portals, food and water and that's the amount I give for summons and lockpicking.
---
The guy said rogues have 0 aoe. It’s not nit picking to call out a lie. Fucking ironic...you use “ackshually” sarcastically while using the non meme version of it. I never said rogues did consistent aoe, I said they have a form of aoe in a response to a guy claiming they have none and how their life is soooo much harder as a rogue.
---
Oh great so frost mages are even better now....
---
Being oppressed by your government doesn't seem fair.
---
China is banning anything and everything that stands up for Hong Kong. China is one of Blizzard’s biggest markets. They have to do this, from a business perspective. Is it “right”? No. But neither is having to lay off every employee working on Blizz China because you got your company banned. 
---
Of course, there’s a bigger discussion to be had about dealing with China, but for them that bridge was crossed long ago.
---
Coincidentally, 1 month is about 8% of a year.
---
Careful according to a post about alchemy drop yesterday strictly states that would be considered NINJA looting 😂 /s
---
small brain: using this to face out the door
---
big brain: using this to face Gamon's spawn point so you can kill him as fast as possible
---
I would like to alt a resto Druid, but coming from a tank only perspective I don’t know much about healers. How viable are they in late game content in comparison to priests or paladins ? (I’m alliance)
---
Blizzard confirmed communists!
---
Thank you! Is Herbalism a skill I can get from the beginning, or is it connected to a specific race or something? (I don’t know if there’s a race+class thing to think about, or just class.)
---
For the record, I'm not in your guild and pulled this photo from the Classic WoW Facebook page lol
---
What what should I be to run DM?  I am lvl 50 Orc Warrior now, and hope to be in the 55+ range by the 15th.  Should I do BRD stuff first?  Does it matter?  Thanks.
---
I only use two of those.  Not bad.
---
I'll copy and past my comment as clearly you haven't read it.
---
1. China owns 1.3 trillion (5%) of the 22 trillion of US Debt. Japan owns 1.1t. US Citizens are the biggest debt holders of US debt. Why are you so worried about China "calling in the debt" and not Japan?
---
 2. China has been selling off their US cash reserves and US debt to strengthen the yuan. They want to peg their currency to the USD. Selling off their US Debt fucks them.
---
 3. The Treasury Department has had no problems in the past getting loans even with credit rating downgrades. So if China called in the 1.1 t (which as I said makes their currency less stable, endangering their exports and by association their middle class) other countries or markets (including the Fed) would step in to meet the requirements.
---
 4. Why would China call in payments on US debt because the Rockets or Blizzard (private companies) allow free speech. You think that after the Rockets GM made that tweet that China called up the US and said "fix this or we will call in the debt!" Which as I explained fucks them worse than it fucks the US.
---
 5. I'm unclear, why would "every commercial bank be left in disarray"
---
 6. Stop talking about shit you are clueless on.
---
НЕТ РЕТЕЙЛУ!
---
Removing records would also be a political stance, just one you don't seem to mind as much.
---
some people get lucky, I saw 2 main hands drop in 70 runs and was lucky enough to win the 2nd one(rolling against 3 other people, like always)
---
Ah thanks for clarifying! Now your comment makes sense of course.
---
Can I get a TL;DR on NBA? It's a basketball org in the US, right?
---
&gt;Blizz listening to the minority that already rushed and i'ts bored
---
Are they though? I've honestly not seen a single person ask for an early dire maul release.
---
Weird, dirty China money tastes exactly the same as dirty American money! Wonder why that is...
---
Yes it will happen in WoW.
---
They care much more about money than they do you.
---
Rules are very often illegal themselves. That ToS that you agreed to I guarantee would not remotely hold up in court because they are *illegal* yet they are "Rules" that you need to abide by to play the game. The world isnt black and white, companies dont have full regulation to post a set of rules and set those rules in stone. You along with everyone else can choose to support or rally against those rules based off of our personal experiences and you should respect t those choices even tho they are different than yours as you very well may change your mind or you may simply be on the wrong side of history.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
They're currently going for 600-1000gold on a lot of servers.
---
I don’t understand why people are calling DM “catch up gear”. DM is a very similar difficulty and time investment as UBRS/Scholo/Strat and for most classes it offers 2-3 pieces of pre-raid bis. Gear from DM is similar in stat numbers to those other dungeon as well. I feel like DM is just an additional dungeon in the pre-raid tier, it’s not like you do DM 3 times and now you have no reason to do any other dungeons for gear anymore but that’s how people are making it sound. DM has some nice pieces for a lot of classes but you still have to work for them and the other end game dungeons still have plenty of pre-raid bis. Adding DM is generally a horizontal progression.
---
Blizzard has been scum since they merged with Activision. People seem to forget they are the same company. Replace Blizzard with Activision and the story doesn't sound very surprising. Also, all the people acting shocked Blizzard is doing this when they are supposedly a "SJW friendly" company, remember Blizzars is only this way when they have financial incentive to do so. They will sell you pride pins all day and take your money to the bank, but drop you like a hot potato if it means playing nice with China, since that is a market they want more money from. I've been saying it for years, Blizzard is an evil company now.
---
Let’s all pretend Warcraft had no parallel to real life nor was it inspired by other works that were themselves parodies or critiques of real life.
---
Shh all the orcs are just made up things/s
---
Druids aren't popular for dungeon healing because their revive is on a 30 minute cooldown, so if someone dies you have to wait for them to run back. It's fine if you have a shadow priest or ret/prot paladin on top of that, but those are very rare.
---
Druids are very good dungeon tanks though, and are much more desired in that role. If you can arrange dungeon runs where you get to roll on healer gear, that would be the ideal scenario.
---
To real, sitting on my I7-8700K 3.70GHZ, GTX 1060 6GB and 32 GB DDR4-RAM 3000 MHz
---
Undead Rogues are everywhere mate i think its cool to see some troll Rogues.
---
Noone cares
---
Top shelf whataboutism
---
Limits on publicly traded companies. When you're publicly traded currently, nothing else matters but the stock price.
---
So close to being self-aware, but still so far
---
/r/Pyongyang seems more up your alley.
---
Lol gz on your reed my friend!
---
I’m Unsubbing too. I like the game but it isn’t as important as real human lives
---
&gt; My concern is that the gear that drops there pretty much leapfrogs MC
---
for what classes, because for a rogue it has 2 or 3 items at most that are better than anything from MC
---
It's not much but I'll be cancelling my sub and uninstalling all blizzard games.
---
So sick of China having so much influence over these companies. Someone needs to honestly have the convection to say fuck these Chinese bastards I'm doing what's right / what I want. Before I'm flooded with " it's a company they want money ", I obviously get this part. However it is a choice a company can make, greed is not everything.
---
I am almost 43 now, at like 41 I went to Arathi to clear out low quests, turns out there are some really long chains for high levels there too. I have way too many quests for STV so at 43 I am heading back there.
---
No its objective it's just a fact not an insult.
---
He cares because he can’t be bothered to read the post to understand the context. Ignore these tools and move on.
---
okay, do the math then. You gonna calculate how often you yellow hit to know the benefit of glancing. Then your gonna need to calculate the rage gain loss from glancing. Then you realize it depends on the boss armor. Then you realize you need a full on simulation to do this accurately.
---
Or you can just say 8% glancing reduction (it's 8, not 10 by the way) equals roughly 1.3% damage.
---
2% hit is straight up more than 2% damage on its own. Never mind crit and AP.
---
Exactly.
---
Priests will always outclass everyone as healers. My biggest issue with druid is no regular rez. They do have battle rez tho
---
Well, where I come from bartenders get paid minimum wage, so what you're saying is I should never tip because the employer will make it up anyway. My tip is just an optional expense. (Don't worry, I know how it really works and I still tip when I travel to the states).
---
On a complete tangent with no point to make: I actually dislike tipping bartenders the most, because I know that at 1$/drink a US bartender gets paid FAR more than their counterparts at home, and I don't think bartenders should get paid more than e.g. checkout assistants or other minimum wage jobs. However, because the US lacks any stricts weights and measures laws, I know that by tipping I am more likely to get poured a larger measure and be seen more quickly. Essentially I am paying more for the chance to get more to drink, I would rather just pay the agreed price and get the agreed service in return.. which takes me right back to the start of this chain!
---
What exactly confuses you from the hit percentage tables in the linked url?  Do you have a specific question you can narrow down?
---
No, People do realize. It is just incredibly hard to distance yourself from so many things. A blizzard subscription is something that is easy to control.
---
I read the context mate but you posted the wrong screenshot and told a crappy story, and you dont even seem to care, so why should I?
---
Right, out of combat only would add to the skill ceiling and not make it OP in dungeons.
---
Maybe, but there's no reason not to. You still get to play for the time you already paid for
---
Well that's just nuts, and he even got his original name in game. Thanks for posting this!
---
Is the recipe guaranteed or are no mages going to have it for a while?
---
Well then you're shit out of luck, because that's literally the only way to do it. 
---
That being said, get creative. Move out of harm's way or use a non-offensive totem like the frost resistance one.
---
There are plenty of level 60s with jobs. I was totally ok with dm coming out in phase 2 but I'm excited to grab my new bis belt ftom dm. I will need all the help I can get for raiding since im new to raiding! Plus that lvl 55 mage water, and epic mount quests should be available for locks and pallies.
---
Cheers! Someone said it's prebis for priest but I'm not too sure really debating if I wanna use or sell
---
Well it's never going to stop and it's honestly so petty to even care. We all know how short that corpse run is, there is way worse things you can do to someone on this game that are perfectly legal and aren't reportable. Why do people give a shit about this?
---
What's the benefit or need behind getting exalted?
---
Again... sit and do nothing. At all. How is that helping? At least we are trying. You just sit there bitching about people wanting to help. Are you in preschool or do you just fail to realize that what you are doing is literally hurting the cause while boycotting and writing letters at least ATTEMPTS to do something?
---
1. No.
---
2. No.
---
3. Vendor ammo.
---
4. Easy.
---
5. It's easy mode PvP.
---
6. You can be a little lazy about it. I'd say upgrade your pet's claw and bite every 10-15 levels if you want. 
---
7. I have zero macros and do just fine. I have a Razer Nagas tho...
---
8. I have just enough keybinds to not have too many. It's really not that many tbh.
---
Tip: keybind shift+scroll wheel up for pet attack and shift+scroll wheel down for pet passive.
---
Hunter is easy. I out DPS all other hunters and 90% of all other players. People who suck just aren't trying.
---
They are acting in their own interest, to ensure they dont lose a massive market.
---
I did this as well since I was stuck with getting Lockpicking higher
---
A sticky keeps the discussion contained so that chinese moderators can more easily delete free-think before it gets archived by websites that show deleted messages.
---
I dunno what that other person El is talking about, if you go in at the right level range i.e. 3 levels below the last boss or higher, and know literally nothing about an instance than you are looking at 2 hours for any of them. If you have a map or are over leveled? they all take an hour or so or less. 
---
Uldaman -&gt; not meant to be run in a single go, the front quarter or half of the instance has level 38-40 mobs and bosses and the back half ends with a 47. Its meant to be run at least twice (design decision). So if youy are level 44 or 45 so you can effectively fight the last boss the first part is a chain pull face roll that takes longer to navigate than to kill. 
---
ZF - can be done in like 45 minutes because at level 44-45 you can skip half or more of the trash in the dungeon. 
---
Maraudon if you know nothing and start from scratch and do all the quests might take 3 hours the first time but really its like an 1:30 hours or so if you do literally everything.
---
Princess run is probably 30 minutes or so for a leveling group, but its like 12 minutes or less for a 60 farming her.
---
Wow, who would have pegged Blizzard as a bunch of anti-democratic boot-lickers?
---
What a shameful move, Blizz.
---
Well Blizzard has huge interest in continuing operations in China so they can't take Hongkongs side. Profit over ethics, as always in capitalism.
---
Someone sold it on AH for 50g and I immediately snapped that up. I think either the poor guy didn't know what it was worth or forgot a 0...
---
Edgemaster's dropped and being a UD warrior i have to make the decision of either being topshelf or selling them for a mount. Kinda wish i rolled with my head instead of my heart and went human
---
It is relevant to show that the game didn't die or suffer from having Dire Maul released less than a month after the game. So it now being released a month and a half after release isn't an issue.
---
Taking someone 100% literally just to make a condescending and obvious point isn't nit-picking?)
---
What a new and exciting take
---
God I hope not.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055031015-053251330001521/1BCDfGHEnPqqr0BCfEhJ
---
This is it. Keep in mind I'm only lvl 54 right now so I'm lacking the last few points in Healing Light and Illumination.
---
I really like this build. I can solo quest fine (ret would be better for pure solo questing, obvs), but I'm spending the bulk of my playtime in instances, either tanking or healing. Much more fun and varied than pure auto attacking as ret.
---
You can't sell them on my server, for anything over 300. No Fury Warriors willing to buy them unless its a steal.
---
I just lightning bolt it to death with searing totem out. Maybe last 300 hp i'll stab it.
---
So if were all cancelling our accounts, what MMO are we going to move to, we should find a non Chinese owned one and flood them with new players. That might actually send a message if enough people get on board and actually follow through.
---
China isn’t censoring Reddit.
---
American, canceling my sub immediately and telling then exactly why
---
Bad move by Blizzard. Having said that they are releasing Diremaul and warlock/paladin epic mount quest-chain on the 15th!
---
Uh not sure what your doing that ooms you in 1-2 minutes I didn’t have that issue. Pots and dark runes got to be prepared for raids
---
When morality pays bills I'll change my tune.
---
Sure... Unfortunately, pretty much all of it's hardware is made in China, while necessary resources for it were extracted with extreme violations of human rights all over the world.
---
&gt; When my subscription runs out I'm done with Wow and Blizzard...
---
No you're not. I'll get back in a few weeks time to see you still commenting on this sub; explaining how excited you are for phase two.
---
You forget, Maul's release now means less content to do in Phase 2. Which means, they'll push Phase 3 out faster, since there's nothing to 'cut out and release early'. Unless you think DMF is going to keep us busy, while we wait a month or so for Phase 3.
---
Nuke China before it's too late.
---
&gt;why don’t we celebrate straight pride
---
We do, it’s called _breathing without being assaulted_ lol
---
Ok so your smartass reply is warranted because you fail the capacity to comprehend what is being asked.  Got it.  I did not accuse anyone of ninja’ing the item, I simply compared it to any other situation where a person would need roll something they can’t actually use.
---
nah something much much worse. 
---
weebs
---
Yet you're the one commenting on my beliefs and not the topic. Tell me how smart you are.
---
Yes, it is. I'm reasonably sure you'd get the same result if you went on their casting shows and spoke about how you totally think authocratic governments are the bomb.
---
Redoubt is better if you're not hitting defense cap elsewhere, but if you are Stoneskin Gargoyle Cape is better and that's what I have now, I'd keep Redoubt in the bag since I'm not at cap yet but it lacks all other stats so yeah.
---
10/10 shit posting, well done sir
---
It ruins your reputation with badies only nothing to worry about in the slightest
---
It's baffling that this is the state now.
---
Assuming it was some weird American thing is a weird way to flex about being non-American.
---
&gt;_&lt; sowwwwy
---
That's actually a pretty neat idea. It pretty much creates a 'Taunt' for PVP.
---
Agreed. But where does Blizzard come into play ? Should Blizzard be the executioner ? Why are the great powers sitting quiet but you expect a gaming company to take a stance ?  
---
The problem isn't the hate and anger people have for China, but rather directing it to a private company that has nothing to do with politics instead of their own leaders.
---
And by doing so acting in the interests of China.  It's pretty simply syllogistic logic here come on buddy
---
Or you could just vote for people that want to regulate corporations so they’re forced to care about ethics via the Nordic model. No living in a cabin off the grid needed.
---
No, it's not. Backing Blizzard in this case, where they want a politics free stream, does NOT mean someone is in support of what regime what so ever.
---
I deleted the game because I played too much. But now I lose the same amount of time on this sub
---
That is an insane stance to take.  If the same player said "long live China" he would have not been banned.
---
I still dont get why 2/3 of players who roll on pvp servers dont like world pvp. Just roll on a normal gd server and stop trying to ruin world pvp for those who picked the correct server type.
---
Hell, look at all the people bitching about phase 2 when it isnt even out, yet. These people are why retail has thebsystem it has today where the server type you pick makes 0 difference
---
This post is lacking in caps lock.
---
I am disappoint.
---
Interviews.
---
Fuck China! Stop supporting those that are in league with the villains of our time!
---
9% for everyone pretty much and if you have 310 wep skill it’s more like 6%
---
Casual sexism of the day here
---
I bet you are. I would be disappoint too if I was chinese and knew I had to watch what I said you fucking shill.
---
Unsubbed from WoW Classic, uninstalled all Blizzard games and the launcher. Fucking sucks because this is the ONLY game I've been enjoying all year but I can't support this bullshit.
---
At least Red Dead 2 comes out on PC in a month.
---
Commenting mainly to see what guides are posted.
---
I don't have a link for a full guide but [this spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/053050013520105001-05-5405001) seems like a good path.  Personally I started leveling as protection but switched to full arms.  This is what I'm going to aim for now though after all the growing pains. 
---
Another useful thing for me was that there are some class specific quests to unlock abilities: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-class-quests-classic-wow
---
Honestly leveling up will help you get the hang of it. Coming in as a complete noob I didn't realize weapon types required special training and not all warrior abilities are learned thru the trainers.  Also it might be obvious but be on the lookout for a bow to draw out mobs with, if you aren't going to charge in.
---
&gt; I stopped my subscription this morning. I support Hpng Kong.
---
Don't buy from Amazon then, or any other major corporation.
---
I told my wife for a month straight I wouldn't be playing but here I am. Doesn't help that I work directly with 2 major wow addicts, 1 of which called out sick just play more today lol.
---
Blizzard has almost always given in to the perception or rather to the largest voice(s). It's why retail is what it is and it's why certain things in classic are going the way they are... for better or for worse.
---
Bro I can literally start a Anti-government party today and stand outside our government hall demonstrating every day and nothing, absolutely nothing, would happen to me. This is not the case in China or Hong Kong. Fuck off to your moms basement.
---
Good. Most people don't care about Hong Kong. They should have started preparing for this moment a long time ago. But they waited until the last minute, fired up the media machine and for some reason just expected USA to swoop in and save the day? Not how it works.
---
And from what I've seen it's just a bunch of kids. I don't support political movements made up of mostly kids. Because kids are stupid and full of their own shit and almost always wrong.
---
I do know that hunters can 100% do it. I thought i read locks doing it too... not sure
---
lol, you'd be a redcoat for sure buddy.
---
The majority of the playerbase aren't 60 yet, most people havent stepped foot in brd let alone mc and the other dungeons. Releasing Dire Maul this early makes these dungeons redundant due to gear upgrades. Why farm brd, ubrs or lbrs when Dire Maul is out? You can still do those dungeons, but whats the point when DM will be out with better gear? It's effectively taking away three dungeons for one. They've already gone off the path for their content plan within a month.
---
I have uninstalled all Blizzard games I own and have decided against trying out Classic as a result of Actiblizzard's actions here.
---
My fiancee has been playing WoW for the the last ten years of our relationship and I told her I'd give WoW a try when Classic came out and I had some time off of work, but now I just can't.
---
Way to go Actiblizzard, you played yourself.
---
In other news, the sky is falling, lets go back to our reporter Chicken Little in the field....
---
Censoring specific viewpoints is absolutely not the politically neutral thing to do.
---
That's pretty nornal. Redridge mountains are horde controlled on my server. 
---
And if you think it's bad now wait till phase two when people start farming honor and you have 50-60 people in the starting areas killing lowbies to bait 60's out
---
Because their leader is a dredlord and they kill anyone who isn’t part of the scarlet crusade assuming they if they aren’t part of the group they are undead simpathizers
---
Yesterday I managed to buy something other than food with the gold I earned.
---
Something I often don't get to experience in real life.
---
Anything can be bought and sold with the right OIL!
---
Guess I'm done with Blizzard. Easiest uninstall ever.
---
Rarely is a comment completely shut down  in 8 minutes, you've hit the nail on the head.
---
No politics in my gaming!   Except for that mountain of politically charged content in the barrens...and silverpine...and basically everywhere.
---
hashtag riseup
---
^^^/s
---
How old are you? You really think involving politics in every aspect in life is a good idea?
---
&gt; ~~Fuck China~~. That is all.
---
Fuck Chinese Communist Party. That is all.
---
The Chinese suffer much more than us from them
---
I wreck melee as a lock, 90 percent of the time you can coil, fear, dot,  and they're dead. if they survive or break/resist the fear you can literally drain tank them to death. That's all without bothing with the voidwalker sacrifice, which I can do twice in very very fast succession.
---
I didn't consider that. I guess I need to limit my buffs until I'm sure of the situation around. Thanks for bringing that up. I didn't even consider the flags initially.
---
could i solo MC attunement  as a 60 druid
---
how about you BOTH feel bad
---
Tack one on another internet argument won!
---
And now r/classicwow is quarantined.
---
My stance on this is small and insignificant, but I feel wrong logging onto wow with this news. I understand not wanting your streamers to be politically involved, but this is our platform in 2019. He used the platform he knew best to raise an issue that is detrimental to any country seeking democracy. We fought for it just like many other countries have. HK will be no different. This small town Texas dude stands with the streamer, and the people of HK. I have cancelled my sub.
---
Was thinking that but I just meant to ask if that would help. I don't really know if paladins at this level would want a weapon like that. Seems warriors and 2-h shamans definitely dont.
---
Literally every time a fiasco like this happens, there are plenty of people who are satisfied with the status quo going "you can't get mad at this, it's just one problem in a giant ocean of problems!"
---
Telling people their outrage is "faux" or "hypocritical" because something within their sphere of experiences is showing signs that are counter to their moral compass has no value other than to discourage people from discussing things they disagree with.
---
Did I say it was oppressive to the discussion? No. But the fact is, no matter how you try to swing it, telling people that they're hypocrites for getting mad about this when they didn't rise up and take arms against Dole in Central America is the epitome of whataboutism.
---
You can't expect everyone to fight all the injustices. None of the people playing WoW were even alive when the magnate behind "banana republics" died. That's such a non-sequitur designed to evaporate the fuel behind a legitimate outcry.
---
Your post makes no indication of "better solutions," it reeks only of defeatism and complacency. The general userbase of this videogame has a direct platform to make their statements against the company, which is a start. Some of these people can't vote. Most of the candidates they could vote for, in any country but especially America would do nothing to support their desires.
---
If nothing else, let the people make a stink. It's a good thing to align public opinion. Between this, the NBA thing, and the countless events bound to happen in the near and far future, an established timeline of China's bullshit can be established that will be useful for real change.
---
I get the people who are strong on Hong Kong independence. I even understand the authoritarian comforts of those who support mainland China, as abhorrent as it may be. What I will never understand is the lukewarm acceptance of people that post things like "stop talking about this it won't change anything." Taking no stance is one thing, but actively discouraging others from sharing their strong opinions is, as I said, tactic acceptance of a police state.
---
Bruh, they failed so much more than just Hong Kong.
---
I feel sorry for you lol. Im in the office for 9 hours 5 days a week, and I am having the time of my life playing wow.
---
For me it was “you think you do, but you don’t.” I’ve come back for classic and I’ve been adoring it, but modern Blizzard hangs like a looming cloud over the experience.
---
But it was something about avoiding guards cause of terrain, not because of being a griefer, which is also sad
---
I wish you could play it in 8k or something stupid to at least get a little more of your moneys worth lol.
---
I'm amazed it was allowed for so long in the first place.
---
This is new, added in Legion. Part of the reason it was left in Classic is that it's huge for accessibility for those with limited mobility.
---
Well it’s not really world news lol. It’s absolutely terrible, but it’s still not general world news.
---
I don't use any UI mods for now (classic interface). I will try to take a look at elvui if that's any good for healer. Back in TBC I was still using classic interface, only with a small 'grid' window for healing.
---
You would have to have a searchable list of every item in order to put in your buy request. This is a gameplay tradeoff, as it could possibly ruin the “mystery” of all these rare items and all.
---
You do realize that all of our top companies are licking China dick right now...? 
---
So the problem is ALL those companies, and not the system (capitalism) that let them operate as such? You sure about that?
---
I'm on smoko!
---
Cancelled my sub and bought the Destiny expansion. Double-fucked them.
---
Except it was not a commentary on the part you quoted, but on this part:
---
&gt; Blizzard has a lot more to lose, and no your cancelled subscriptions are not adding up.
---
Saying that cancelling your subscription doesn't add up is akin to saying:
---
Also, to respond to your message, I disagree.
---
I disagree with you calling people hypocrites, because it is hard for people to keep track of all injustice. This is in the news right now and people want to respond to it. That is a good thing. You're argument seems like you are saying do everything or do nothing. (Not saying you are implying this, but it seems like this to me.)
---
Then, I disagree and agree with your *don't hate the player, hate the game*. If enough people cancel subscriptions it sends a message. Unfortunately the company will not see the error of its ways in a moral sense, but it might align itself more with the "right" side. Change needs to start somewhere. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
---
I do agree that it is a problem with what companies are allowed to do, but I think that the whole "people in charge of companies are not held accountable for the actions of the company" is a whole other debate in itself.
---
Thank you for your reply though, I hope you also understand my point of view.
---
Starting a nonprofit to support Chinese protesters. Anyone want in?
---
It is. I’ve been playing runescape for over 15 years intermittently. RS3 is the *original* runescape that has progressed and changed significantly over the years. Old School Runescape is the runescape I grew up with and has changed slightly over the years, but every major decision is made by the players and thus only the content people want will be added
---
&gt; If you're not 60 yet, I hope you weren't hoping to do BRD, LBRS or UBRS. Because all of those dungeons are pointless with the release of Dire Maul and groups will be scarce. 
---
This is so bullshit....  
---
DM gives you a few item (pre raid) Bis changes, but not much more.
---
DM back in the days was released about 2,5 months after original launch.  
---
Now they release if after 1 month, 1 could argue it to soon, and 1 could argue it right on time.  
---
Blizzard is the one who got the data and decided this with this data.... don't agree ? maybe you should apply for an job @ Blizzard, but i can tell you 1 thing, they dont hire cry babies like you
---
Because mods are removing these type of posts in other blizzard related forums.
---
I was really enjoying Classic; my best friend and I live across the country and haven't had something so fun to do together since I moved from home.
---
That doesn't matter. After this, it's not even a vaguely difficult decision for me to cancel my sub. I couldn't bring myself to play any of their games again. Fuck Blizzard.
---
Mage girl 91 the warlock, i dont think you get how this shit works
---
But average person dont need more than that.
---
This reads like a line out of an anime
---
thats cool, no skin off my back. different strokes for different folks. Hope you still have a good day
---
It's even worst. Blizzard isn't supporting Hong Kong. Blizzard is penalizing a player for utilizing Blizzard's platform for his personal political gain.
---
Blizzard essentially responded with "Shut up. We're here to play."
---
Olaf's song ***is*** fucking beautiful, man.

The NBA commissioner just made a statement saying basically that they will defend their employee’s freedom of speech. In response to that CCTV said they will no longer air NBA games. The commissioner then said, basically, “if those are the consequences then those are the consequences”.
---
The NBA is handling their situation much better than Blizzard. To be fair also Blizzard probably gets a lot more revenue from China, but still.
---
Neat
---
I have 80 gold at level 51 soooo
---
I don't think blizzard has a substantial income source coming from nazis or anti-lgbtq individuals. They do from the Chinese
---
This is what I don't get. Look at the gear Dire Maul adds.  Most classes get 2 pieces that are optional pre-raid BiS, there will still be tons of Strat, Scholo, BRD, and BRS runs.
---
Now that you mention it, I always thought those wolves were bugged, but perhaps that's just how it works.
---
Yet here we are.
---
its actually free on comedy central's site right now i watched it last night. Its kind of like when they played kanye's a gay fish episode in response to him being a gay fish at the VMA's
---
You keep saying that. You keep saying it over and over and over again. Are you trying to convince us, or yourself?
---
I still enjoyed retail 2013-2015
---
Since I learned about their treatment of Uyghurs I've entirely stopped importing things from China.

I think I'm just a noob, another redditor mentioned below about flagging myself for pvp. I didn't even think about that part.
---
That everything has been cleared for quite some time now, even with Pugs. In Vanilla it took ages for the first group to down Rag.
---
Bis is a bit subjective though
---
I cancelled my sub too.
---
Get this game to the top folks! We need to hear what the gamers in Hong Kong think about this more than anything
---
I just hit 38 this morning with just short of 3 days played and I don't ask very often. It feels like I play a lot when I'm not working or on work travel. Some of my friends already hit 60 but they don't have kids or wives... Dire mail is too soon. Fuck the elitists and complaining that there isn't enough to do. This stuff wasn't even available until like 6 months into wow if I recall correctly
---
Yes. Any class can do the lava skip solo at 60, from there you just need to get past the fire elementals, which you do with stealth.
---
I think I could play it on 32k lol
---
Now try alt+tab
---
or you can try alt f4 + tab ;)
---
I canceled mine this morning.  It pisses me off so much cause I just got my mount and was in a new zone and loving the change of scenery.
---
Now, I got til Oct 11th to be able to play.
---
I’m sad that I feel I morally need to do this
---
Why is fascism becoming so popular lately?  What is going on
---
Fuck china. 
---
Ban me blizzard. Fuck your greed.
---
Really disappointing by Blizzard.
---
If anything dm will help casuals raid mc.
---
Which was corrected. And hasn't reoccurred. And, not justifying anything, other subs have posted in MUCH worse. 
---
No one remembers when The_Donald was at the top of /all and was the subject of numerous complaints from liberals prior to the 2016 election? So they changed the algorithm to keep TD off the front page.  Or when u/spez actively edited peoples posts on that sub? That's censorship peeps. 
---
I get it. No one is going to agree with me here. But it's censorship guys. And it's not cool.

I think Kendrick Lamar winning a Pulitzer put a fire under their ass, cuz they were bland at for a few years, and now they're back to being political

This is the time for classic players to unionize and cancel their subscription until blizzard changes their anti-humanatarian stance on this. We get it, China has a lot of players, but if you want to become a Chinese distributor then don't expect the west to turn a blind eye to the censorship and marginalization of the communities China oppresssles under their one party authoritarian regime.
---
Except this came just a little bit before this and the NBA situation. Obviously you could see it coming and they likely had someone talk to them from Comedy Central about Chinese censors to spark the episode though.
---
That was the Blizzcon preview.
---
Yikes, I feel bad for any loved ones in your life.  
---
If you happen to have any.
---
True, but by the time Phase 2 releases, Maul will be 'done with'. If MC/Ony are to be used as reference, then WBs will be 'done with' (by what ever percentage Blizzard is using now to justify releasing Maul) in about 60 days. So that means, Phase 3 will likely be released before the year's end; not even 2020, and we'd be **half way** through Classic.
---
Basically, it's the Marshmallow Test. Instead of us waiting and getting 3 (when P2 releases with: Maul, Honor System, and WBs). We now get one marshmallow *now* (Maul), but that means P2 will not have 3; only 2. - Something supporters of this seem to not understand: They are giving up things to do **then** for something to do **now**.  ...maybe they shouldn't have rushed to 60.
---
((I'm guessing it's the 60s that wanted Maul released since they're 'done' with their characters and have nothing left to do on them until new content comes out.))
---

The chinese government can just ban all blizzard games in china if they want to force them to do something.
---
Thanks, it's hard.  Fortunately finding another video game to play is easy given there are literally hundreds of thousands of them.
---
Who decides who is allowed to be an investor? How do we decide whether an investment is acceptable or a capital crime?
---
How do we handle the various Russian investments? Or Saudi? Are those murdering offenses, or are those acceptable? What about Turkish firms? Or hell, good old American organized crime run through fronts? I feel like this problem is a lot more nuanced than you're giving it credit for.
---
Even on Blizzard's ow  forums, the number of people who are "reading comprehension challenged" is astounding. The ban had NOTHING to do with bowing to China. It was about breaking a specified rule in the terms of the tournament.
---
Damn headline only readers......,
---
No no no, I don’t think you understand. You’re supposed to lock and delete the thread and stiffle any present and future discussion of the topic while calling everyone children for not following the rules.
---
Heh I’m sure you’re just confused about how to be a moderator on Reddit, I’ll make sure you get that memo.
---
Aaand I cancelled my subs. I knew they were getting into bed with China but this is absolutely shocking.
---
It's seems that slope is pretty slippery.

Amen. My company printed T-shirts and had everyone take a picture with them for social media during pride month this year. Take a guess how much in donations or volunteering the company did for LGBTQ people.

Get off your high horse.  This guy wanted to take a stand, what does the rude comment bring to the table other than purely for the sake of being rude? If you have nothing to actually add to the conversation, then why be a part of it?  Just to shit on the OP?
---
There are ways to get the same points across without being a dick.
---
That's why I didn't say that.but blacksmithing teaches you to open locks too, so what's the difference?
---
I have started stacking int and using Furor and a wolfshead helm to just get tons of rage. If you have wolfshead helm and furor that gives you enough ragw for 2 swipes just from shifting into bear. So for a big pull I like self casting rejuv and regrow, I insect swarm the melee mob and shift. Faerie fire the other mob and rip two swipes, power shift then two more swipes. This is insanely fun to do. Also if you completely drop aggro and cannot get any rage? Powershift and boom enough rage for 2 swipes. I got my wolfshead helm for 5g on AH and I would have paid double. I'll never use another helm except to heal.
---
I'm having a really hard time believing this is real. I know Blizzard is bad but to this level?
---
I don't know what you were expecting but it sounds like you didn't either
---
it would unironically be easier to protest outside of Blizzard HQ than in the streets of HK
---
It’s the proportion of response that makes it egregious. They could have made it a month ban, a forfeit of a percentage of the prize money, etc. the smack down being so thorough and extreme makes it appear as though they’re not just upset about the rule violation but also the words spoken. It was a knee-jerk, not thought through reaction and it’s costing them.
---
&gt; This is not a good look for them
---
Here. This is not a good look for them HERE. In China, it's a fantastic look for them, and China is what they care about right now.
---
When you are lower level, it's hard to get the custom to begin with.  Trying to offer lowbie +3 enchants to 50-60 players and expect a fee is a bit much.
---
But you think they are choosing money over morality.  That's where you're wrong sk8r boi. They were chosing money. Period. They dont consider it a versus matchup. They are a business and business is about money. Dont expect a presumably 19 year old would be savvy enough to realize that.
---
This is what I mentioned in another comment. 
---
They probably made the calculation of "being banned forever in China by allowing pro Hong Kong comments" is worse than "be the target of outrage in the west for a few months"
---
They'll survive as a company because most people won't care and keep playing.
---
Funny to see how one of their most smash-hit successful releases dragging in millions of players is simply a replica of what Blizzard provided their players 15 years ago.
---
True. Main stream news is picking it up now.
---
Nah they said they stopped filming that way awhile ago.
---
Maybe a couple hundred gold not a 1000 lol
---
PR, no PR they still righted a wrong (or at least tried)
---
Same applies to youtubers helping homeless people on the street. Who cares they do it for attention/views? It's still help.
---
The sub was doing exactly that on a daily basis are you fucking retarded or just willfully ignorant?
---
it's time to stop blaming Activision for Blizzard's decisions.
---
When I've asked rogues for picking help, I've always offered a 50-50 split of the vendor value of the items within, because essentially the value is 0 til it's opened, so it's not *really* a loss. You can even downplay the trust angle on more valuable boxes because if you're in a party when they pick, you see EXACTLY what they take out. But if you do trust them you can just mail the lockboxes to them and have them send stuff back with a C.O.D.
---
I pass on locked chests as Warrior, and I'm a bit annoyed to send all my locked boxes to my rogue friend.
---
One of the oldest non written rules that disappeared was "If the chest is locked, it belongs to the rogue".
---
I cancelled my sub, and as soon as I get home for the first time in 15 years I'm going to uninstall WoW (along with Overwatch) and I'm not supporting another Blizzard product again unless they make this right.  I know enough people will continue playing and subbing to their games that it probably won't make a difference, but my soul is not for sale.  I'm going to miss WoW like hell, but I won't be able to really enjoy it anyway, or sleep soundly at night if I turn a blind eye to this.
---
It's not though. But hey, if you want to believe that nonsense, go ahead :). There are people stupid enough to believe earth is flat, this comes into that category.
---
Hi, /u/baby_jay_3000

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/df0m1z/turns_out_blizzard_was_the_biggest_chinese_gold/).

With your final days make &lt;Free Hong Kong&gt; on your server. Spread the word. They can't ban us all

farm gold? level alts? level warlocks so your guild can actually be competitive? I have been playing an embarassing amount of hours and I STILL feel like I could double my hours played and still have things I need to get done.
---
How much did you get in the lawsuit?
---
What I mean is that I personally feel behind the curve, which I know that I'm not - being level 52.  The feeling of being rushed also comes from my not having run all of (any of) the level 55+ dungeons yet.  I'm not saying that the content is being rushed, but that I feel rushed by a compressed release schedule.
---
We found the blizzard pr director
---
&gt;BRD, LBRS or UBRS. Because all of those dungeons are pointless with the release of Dire Maul and groups will be scarce.
---
Now don't be dramatic, this is utter nonsense.   BRD  still has BiS items for many (pre raid of course)  and BRS is needed for all attunement quests, Dal Rends, UBRS key, Drakki loot etc etc  
---
in a year time people will do more UBRS than DM.  DM is nice for solo farming and buffs , but for random pugs it's not that amazing.
---
No that’s the thing.  Capitalism inherently has perverse incentives like this.  It’s completely inherent to the system and if you have a ceo who won’t kowtow to China, he’ll get fired and replaced with someone who will.  Morally speaking, capitalism only cares about money and it’s a race to the bottom ethically.  
---
I’d also argue this system isn’t really that free.  I doubt the average blizzard employee, you know the ones doing all the work, we’re consulted on this.  The employees are effectively removed from the decision making process here.  They could unionize, but the USA has a shaky history with unions at the best of times.

Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age.

Haha got it in my first run as a rogue :)
---
Oh fuck ya you can
---
The difference between truestrike and black dragonscale is not at all similar to the 15 agi vs black baron. The set bonuses kinda need to be included in the calculation.
---
People are free to grab a 15 agi cape if they want. I'm still keeping the black baron one on there simply due to the fact that it has nothing even close to equivalent.
---
Wow, fuck Blizzard. Just uninstalled battlenet. Small but necessary gesture.
---
So what? Literally every company does this when it involves a publicly facing entity.
---
what the fuck
---
*partially owned
---
How can you do it, normally player STOPS after this they don't keep running..
---
&gt;  *as a tank, it's always my fault*
---
No, and you'll learn this the closer to 60 you get. At some point late in the game dungeons start turning into fucking **Details!** E-Peen menageries for the Dee Pees, with every goddamn *mage-pull hunter scattershot fucking earthshock-this AoE/Burst/Poly-Wastes-MyDPMana...* did I hear a goddamn mindblast? *... -fests.*
---
Early on I earned on my server an amazing reputation and was called the best tank in the realm my many. By the time I was 60, I just started letting those motherfucking moron mages die. I don't even try to get that AoE aggro back. If you're killing in the name of *speed &gt; safety*, then you can take a dirt nap. My job is to make sure we get through this; not make sure we get through this as fast and as riskily as possible.
---
Then the Hunters and the Mages have the audacity to bombast about it over voice, like it's some superstar competition. *Oh look, wtf man you suck I just passed you!* Sure you did, by blowing every CD and doing as much AoE damage as possible as fast as possible. 
---
I've since tarnished that reputation, and certain mages can smd
---
But mods bad!
---
I just unsubbed. You can’t have both markets.
---
It will happen to WoW, but not like you think.
---
Blizzard has strict rules for tournament play. They specifically have a rule that basically states 'don't be controversial at a tournament.' They don't want people doing things to be notorious or for stunts, or that make Blizzard looks bad. This falls under a notorious stunt.
---
If this effects WoW, it will be in their tournament scene.
---
No, I'm playing devils advocate to shine light on how ridiculous and petty that scenario in booty bay is to warrant a thread whining about it as if it's some alarming thing.
---
But yeah, I do gank lowbies sometimes. Sue me.
---
I mean, they use them to harvest organs.  Might as well keep them busy while they're waiting for death.
---
You're missing the point. It's not about what's allowed. It's about players or athletes using a platform with high visibility to promote human rights. Who cares if it's allowed by the authorities or corporation organizing the event. They knew thousands (if not millions) of people were watching, so they seized the opportunity.
---
&gt; if you search hard enough
---
I really don't have to search that hard, NFL players have been kneeling during the US national anthem since 2016.
---
Pretty sure the casters were in on it. They were laughing and ducking their heads before the guy even said it. Really weird to be giggling like a school girl during such a statement when you can literally be killed for saying something like that.
---
Hey first person I've seen to do my og vanilla dinging 60 idea. Congrats bud I'm 8 levels behind you to relive my original pic.
---
Jesus fuck I bet their eyes lit up when they saw this. Thousands of pissed of card collectible players that they can appeal to by doing a morally good thing? It's like shooting babies in a fishing net.
---
The internet you are on is pretty filtered and censored.
---
Some real draconian language in there.
---
Finally, an idea I can get behind.
---
I've read this (about tanking as an off-spec). My goals will definitely be to do lots and lots of dungeons. If I can find time in a day to do raids, that would also be a goal. Currently, however, I maybe get an hour, hour and a half to play a day, and very little time on the weekends.
---
Once my schedule balances out, the high hope is for raiding. For now, though, dungeons are the main goal, and providing a positive dungeon experience as a tank for repeat business.
---
The whole reason they made Diablo a mobile game is because mobile games are super hot in China right now.
---
70,000 bots couldn't be wrong!
---
Just tell the group. If they're good people, they'll appreciate it and more often than not, it's not the first time for everyone else so omeone can show you the way.
---
Actually it is banneable cause they didn't want to allow that kind of game experience grief IIRC
---
In before Mei has been a CCCP member all along
---
Thanks! Definitely worth the wait!
---
I'm not here crying. I'm simply here to find out of if this is the normal experience for a pvp server in general or if this is an isolated incident. I've never played on a pvp server so I have no context to compare it to while some of you would know immediately if this was the normal. I apologize if it comes off as "crying to reddit". That is not the intention.
---
Chinese investors own like 10%, so no, reddit's not there...yet.
---
I never thought about that. I guess warriors and rogues both have ranged weapons. Do pally's really not have guns/bows/throwing?

Whenever I see people undercut for only 1-2 copper, I always buy the higher priced one because fuck you and fuck my 2 copper.

If literally unable to play, what's the difference?  That I *might* continue to play until my subscription runs out?  That I might resume my subscription at a later date and play again?

Sorry that's somehow not good enough for you.

&gt; Around level 25 you can get the Warson Boots from the Ashenvale chain and it's worth putting minor speed on them.

I'm a level 36 druid and still wearing them. So checks out.

I have a 55 female human warlock, wanted one since vanilla

Probably the best choice I’ve made, until I saw the Dps of a mage....

Stay strong with your warlock . Battle grounds will be amazingly fun

My loved ones would be a part of me though, I just cant be arsed a out people around the world, its not a crazy idea to think about
---
Do you ever feel like the class is too mechanically intense? For example, having to constantly manage your Auto Shot, your position, your pet and whatever else compared to another class that has a simpler rotation and/or no pet?
---
**A: I think the Hunter Class is super easy to pick up and learn, but hard to master. Mechanically intense? Not at all. Timing your auto-shot with**   
---
**everything else starts to feel like driving a stick shift. You start to just know and feel when it's going to shoot and plan accordingly. As far as pet**   
---
**management, I just use a macro or 2.** 
---
Do you ever feel like the class is a chore? Similar to the previous question, you have to constantly control basic things like who your pet is attacking in both PvE and PvP. Then you also have out of combat things such as food/ammo/bag space.
---
**A: Class is only a chore if you forget to have food on you at all times for yourself, and your pet, or you forget to buy ammo.. Don't be that guy.**   
---
**ALWAYS vendor ammo. Crafted ammo is nice if you have the mats/profession but really the damage difference is null. Again with using macros for**   
---
**your pet, and re-binding passive keybind so you don't pull randomly. Bag space stops becoming an issue after you get silk bags/rune cloth bags.** 
---
Do you need to use crafted ammo in PvP? My understanding is that you generally use the vendor ammo except on bosses in PvE.
---
**A: See my answer above for this one. PvP / PvE I use the same ammo. No that big of a difference. The pricing for thorium arrows/rounds doesn't**   
---
**justify the damage differences**
---
How difficult is PvE kiting? Is it just a case of keep aggro, don't get hit and know where you need to run or do you need to do more complex things with aspects/traps?
---
**A: PvE kiting is easy, especially with AotC. You just need to remember to do a quick jump turn, sting, or arcane shot to maintain damage. Knowing**   
---
**where to run while kiting, not pulling other things on the way, and ofc feigning at the right time.** 
---
How punishing would you say the class is in PvP for the average player? There are many people who will say that the skill floor is quite a bit higher than other classes and that something like a mage is much more intuitive to play.
---
**A: I would say for an average player in PvP not too bad, just try to keep your distance. If you don't know how to react to someone jumping on your**   
---
**deadzone, you're going to die w/o backup. Again - everything comes with experience and learning for these situations**
---
How lazy can you be with taming/traning pets? So, if I just want an ordinary cat for PvP, something like a wolf for PvE and something suitable for solo farming, can I get these without having to tame loads of random things just for the higher rank pet skills?
---
**A: You can be kind of lazy with taming. Training at end game is CRITICALLY important. Your pet will die, every 15 seconds if you screw up your**   
---
**training on your pets in MC / ONY. There's guides all over for pets, utilize it. To answer what you "need" for PvP / PvE... that question is more of a**   
---
**"play how you want, tame what you want, also use a guide if it's that important to you." REMEMBER TO FEED YOUR PETS**
---
How many essential macros do you have at 60? I assume scatter/FD/trap but what else?
---
**A: Essential macros? Not really, but I've been playing awhile. For a newer player trying out hunter, I would say a macro for Hunter's Mark + Pet**   
---
**attack in one button, and the FD macro for when you get jumped, or can't spam your buttons fast enough. May be some others, just google it up!**
---
Do you have many more keybinds compared to other classes?
---
**A: This is a loaded question. It really depends on how hard you play the class, and how YOU want to play. For me I have every single bar full of**   
---
**abilities/items. But for me I have different lvls of abilities on my bar, with food for my pet, pet macros, all traps, pots, trinkets etc. Hunter has a ton**   
---
**of options in the toolkit, you don't need them all though. It's a matter of how you want to play and what you want to do in the game.** 
---
**All in all, enjoy playing a Hunter. It's one of the best if not THE best solo classes in the game. Has great utility, does decent damage. It's just fun to play. It's immersive as hell, and has a ton of different builds/options for endgame that are all viable. Just try it out till lvl 20. Get your pet at lvl 10, and enjoy the ride.**
---
not really seeking gold, but it just seems better than questing all over again. mindless grinding vs having to travel all over the damn place lol

Probably. Hell Blizzard made a version of WoW specifically for China.

I did a quick loot at warrior plate tanking gear and I think there is 1 item that may be good in DM. Depending on other bits I may not even run it unless someone drags me along.
---
Yea no kidding lol and crippling poison for kiting helps.. evasion.. list goes on
---
They’re in the south wall area and east. Easier to get as a 60
---
It must be exhausting to be in constant outrage.  FFS they didn't "lie."
---
But it is not a platform for political speech regardless, and clearly blizzard's contracts had a clause already in them that allowed them to push that. The rules where clear, violating those rules is up the person. Blizzard is scared of china, something no American company should fear. This is why the first amendment is so important
---
So your argument is that there are more things to do for people that are lvl 60 and you aren't going to be doing as much instances with lvl 60s during leveling?
---
I'm with you, stay strong, I'm going to uninstall WoW for the first time in 15 years tonight when I get home, already cancelled my sub.  I love Warcraft, I even love Retail, but I'm not going to suspend my beliefs over a game.
---
I had no idea of this. Thanks stranger!
---
I can’t even see you, that high up on your pedestal
---
Who do you think I'm even responding to?
---
Ok if you don't think it should be then why are you against Blizzard enforcing the rules they put in place?

Seems like stealing.

Need rolling on a BOP to vendor it vs. someone who will use it is a lot different than need rolling on something while being a couple levels from being able to use it.

True, he stresses healers mana, we did him just by barely making him spawn and dying in the process on the ramp up to him, shaman ankhing and quickly ressing us so we could pull him with the two remaining ogres, both healer and tank were under 60 tho and I was literally fresh 60 ding still wearing trash lveling gear and we could have played it better, tank had this unending resolve to break my sheeps the whole fight.
---
Loving the salty rogue in the first one :)
---
Stop playing Blizzard games. Uninstall Battle.net
---
Can I have your gold????? Please
---
Honestly something even more cringe than this is all the people saying they are unsubbing or uninstalling because its the cool thing to say. Guarantee you can check this post in 2-6 months time and look at peoples post history and they are right back. This happens all the time and people move on to something else and come right back.

Again. This is the problem.

I wish that were true buddy, I wouldn't be browsing reddit at work, wondering what the hell happened to common sense.

Not a ninja.
---
Fuck blizzard man. Boycott time.
---
Yes but knowing doesn’t change the effect of constant reminder in situations like this, in my opinion. 
---
The kid is a martyr, not in the traditional sense of dying for the cause but he sacrificed his platform on hearthstone to spread a message. That’s modern martyrdom in my book, and while it isn’t as severe or intense, it is still worth while. And I am deeply disappointed that blizzard and other American companies are refusing to acknowledge what the Chinese are doing. 
---
Social outrage like this can lead to companies making changes (albeit for the wrong reasons often times as they just want to protect their profits) but like we saw with the backlash against the nba over the last several days, THIS MORNING the commissioner of the league released a statement directly in contrast to the Chinese narrative because the nba was receiving so much bad publicity. That is good in my book. And It only happened because of constant reminders.
---
At an interview of all things he gave his opinion on something that impacts his daily life. Blizzard banned him for that and took several thousand dollars away from him. Unbelievable. Blizz had a real soft spot in my heart, not any more.
---
farm mats? All you have to do is farm the tusks. Just buy the charms at the AH. I spent about 8g to get all the charms. I PUG the tusks cause there's always people killing those trolls and asked a guildie (lvl 45 druid) to solo cyclonian. I got my axe at lvl 31 :)
---
Amazing how many warriors didn't even realize that those charms are BOE.
---
Yeah, Mara will be your first significant boost - especially with the Blackstone Ring. After that, your next major upgrade will be a 2H sword - Warmonger - which gives +3% chance to hit. At first, you basically want to get hit capped; after that, all other stats are just gravy.

It's not about censorship so much as it's about keeping the sub on topic. I think the mods have handled it well.

Actually he's right about your argument. You're obviously just salty because this has just happened to you.

no lol

for my sadness i love it :(

Really a personal call. I sell everything before 60 to get as much gold as I can for when I’m 60 ;-) Cheers!

They do not explicitly ban politics or anything even remotely close to it in the agreed upon (by contestants) rules.
---
&gt;2019 HEARTHSTONE® GRANDMASTERS OFFICIAL COMPETITION RULES v1.4 p.12, Section 6.1 (o)
---
&gt;Engaging in any act that, **in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image** will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.
---
This is the relevant rule.
---
Note the bold section. This is a 100% catch-all for ANY and ALL actions Blizzard deems unwanted.   
---
What's important here is this is entirely subjective and sets *zero* limits on what blizzard can ban you for, and revoke any winnings for.
---
Essentially, the person could have shared his love of waffles and Blizzard could have banned him for it, for any reason they saw fit.
---
# This is not in any way about Blizzard not wanting politics in their e-sports. 
---
This was entirely motivated by Blizzard fearing repercussions from a regime which enslaves, tortures and murders with zero accountability, among other wonderful acts, like organ harvesting.
---
It's entirely despicable, and without excuse.
---
I'm cancelling my subscription to WoW, and anyone who cares about democratic values and *basic human rights* ought to do the same.   
---
# This is not a "whatever" case, this is Blizzard actively siding with an authoritarian regime, this is Blizzard catering more about the potential Lois of the Chinese market more than the death, torture, and harvesting of thousands of Chinese Chinese.
---
Don't fool yourself here. This is serious. This is not "just a game".
---
We can hold Blizzard accountable even if we can't hold China accountable.
---
I just prefer "solid" to "completely half-baked". The point is not "don't use any of those companies". The point is if you're going to take a stand against this sort of thing, take a real stand, not just a flavour-of-the-day one that's most convenient for you.
---
It doesn't need to be perfect, someone rightfully pointed out that some people rely on services like the ones above for their livelihood. Just as Blizzard employees rely on Blizzard not completely butt-fucking themselves out of the Chinese market so that they don't *lose their jobs* when Blizzard can't afford to pay them anymore.
---
Guess who takes the hit when people boycott companies like Blizzard? D'you think it's the CEOs at the top cutting themselves fat bonuses?
---
In before it gets locked
---
I cancelled my sub. “Your company takes orders from a despot and is this despotic.”
---
Stay strong ✊🏻
---
You were saying this situation is fair because it was a set out rule that he broke. I am pointing out that the rule can be applied to anything, therefore it doesn't mean anything if he broke a rule. Someone can be banned for saying he doesn't like chocolate if it offends someone who is lactose intolerant if, by the rules own wording, Blizzard decide that they can. The rule is worthless, you don't get to appeal to the fact someone broke the rule if it is inherently flawed, and is only there as a final line of legal justification for anything they don't want to explicitly name. They're not exactly going to write 'we'll ban idiots who don't fall in line', are they?
---
Literally no one said anything about this being, or not being, typical for companies. That said, it certainly is a little gross when a company does something so blatant. This isn't exactly on the same level of setting Transformers 3 partly in China to attract an Eastern audience, it's blatant bending over to a government.
---
Guy here, Playing with my girlfriend. We are level 49 at the moment. It truly is wonderful playing with your partner. We have had a LOT of fun so far, and im sure theres more good moments to come :)
---
Maybe I'm in the minority here I guess - but I don't believe a prize acceptance podium is the appropriate place for political messages. I believe the policy as listed above is relevant in the scenario that occurred.
---
The casters being both fired is suspicious and shouldn't have had anything to do with anything though.
---
Wasn't South Park anti-Kaepernick for doing virtually the same thing but for an American issue instead?

Well because that is all that matters.  "It's just business" is essentially the religion of the world these days.

So let the BiS 60's make alts instead of rushing through progression releases.

If u don't like it, then don't play.  Simple as that.

That’s super cool, I honestly had no idea!
---
what exactly is controversial about his stance?
---
Unacceptable. Fucking unacceptable
---
Blizzard: I told you classic was going to be a ghost town after a couple months of release  
---
Yup, because you lost support from the public when you literally put profits above human rights.
---
Unless you get really lucky no, you usually only open like 3-5 a hour spamming in ironforge.
---
Fuck China.
---
Racials in current are nowhere near as impactful as in classic. They only occasionally are helpful in raids, last time I can remember was goblins jump could bypass a mechanic. I've never heard of anyone who grinded out an allied race for the racial.
---
Facebook is not in China specifically because of this you clown.
---
I'm 38. Started first day. IRL has been hectic so I haven't played a lot. I prioritize many simple things before WoW. Also I played Vanilla back in 2005-2006 and I love the game. I guess people are different.
---
#OH DEAR GREAT CHINA, WE R AHHH SO SOWWY FOR THIS DISHONOR TO YOUR GREAT AND KIND NATION.  PLEASE TO ACCEPT OUR APOLOGY.

This made me chuckle, then I got sad
---
The right to cancel my subscription!
---
El oh el so randum

I wanted to enjoy launch as much as possible and ended up maxed like just over a week after it launched and I regret nothing. Most fun I've had questing in wow since I started.
---
I made sure the folder was appropriately named like it explained but not sure why the duration isn't appearing. 
---
Is there an alternative addon i could try?
---
Devilsaurs are rare and highly contested, good fucking luck expecting to make money off that solo as much as you could with herb or ore. His point stands. When LW skins are profitable they are very much so, but they are also very rare so it balances out. Let the skinners make their money.
---
Just canceled. What the fuck are you doing blizzard.
---
We got a company to burn.
---
Wow, you know things are ban when they have to close down their entire page.....
---
Burning crusade. Easily.
---
yeah for sure, instant flash or holy light on yourself is pretty nuts.  Or holy wrath if doign undead farming.  Skullflame shield + HoE with lifestealing enchant would be bananas.
---
I unsubbed. I know its a drop in the bucket. But I can't in good conscience give this company money.
---
Do you have a rebuttal to my point or are you just interested in name calling and e-peen flexing?
---
This actually got me to uninstall hearthstone on my devices for the first time in years. I wonder what I'll do with my time
---
So if I hold an event where I explicitly say "No politics" and you come in, sign that you won't say anything political, and proceed to say something political on the stage, I cannot take action against you breaking my rule, because you're in the right ?  
---
This is not how the real world works.
---
Makes a lot more sense why American media is so quiet on the issues over there. Seems every big company is worried about upsetting their profit.
---
I *highly* doubt that he would have been stripped of his title, fined of his winnings and banned for saying a political candidates name. 
---
Blizzard took the actions they took **because it was China**. China doesnt want people supporting Hong Kong because Hong Kong is going against them. 
---
They pressure companies with a simple "You do what we want or we ban you from China", the same thing happened in Dota earlier this year and it will continue to happen until companies finally say enough is enough.
---
As a lvl 35 warrior who has the same time to play and not in a rush I totally agree.
---
Even if it's different mobs in the same pack that is still both extremely lucky and extremely rare.  I've spent hundreds of hours playing already and haven't seen a BOE epic drop outside of the tailoring recipes, including inside dungeons(spent an unhealthy amount of time in them)
---
&gt;I like my games more than human rights
---
Ah ok.
---
But my bags are full of crap on my main!
---
Why are they bringing out Dire Maul outwith the rest of phase 2 as they stated was their original plan?
---
So just looking for some input on how classic might perform @ 1440p. Ordered a new monitor with a new rig to follow in a month or two. Current set up is i5 6600k @4.4 GHz, Sapphire nitro rx480 8gb, 16gb ram. New monitor is 1440p 144mhz with freesync. Just wondering what I can expect out of that. Thanks!
---
That quote really blows the mind.
---
No it isn't...
---
It doesn't have much to do with Tencent, honestly. If Aciblizz wants to play in the Chinese market and access those 1.3 billion Chinese consumers, then they have to play by the Chinese government's rules.
---
Long before Tencent was even a thing, Bliz was playing ball with China with their own Chinese version of wow without references to death and special chat filters.  This entire thing is about Bliz keeping their access to the Chinese market.
---
I feel remarkably dumb now.
---
Theodor Adorno, the Marxist critic from the Frankfurt School of the mid-20th century, would base much of his entire theory of aesthetics on this idea. “Art is social to the extent that it refutes the social.” Art is involved in society like a magnet is to a field of iron filings — the former attracts the latter, but the two ultimately do not become subsumed by one another. They remain separate entities but are nevertheless bound and to some degree determined by one another. 
---
And cultural critic Fredric Jameson, from closer to today as well — every work of literary analysis is in the last stage political. (The Political Unconscious)
---
The world is fundamentally permeated by politics, whether one embraces it or rejects it wholesale.
---
No. But str, stam, and AP are useful as well to rogues &amp; warrs. Just because it has spirit doesn't mean it's druid prio.
---
Canceling your subscription to wow isn’t going to do shit for Hong Kong. I’m sick of people acting like they are making a difference by canceling their sub. There are real ways that you can help change the world and get rid of the corrupt leaders who run it. Most of the people will be back after this blows over in a week anyways.
---
I just canceled my subscription and uninstalled the b-net client. Blizzard used to be cool, what happened? Fucking Activision.

See bolded text.

SPriest are extremely difficult for any class.

But then he blew up the raid in MC and then rage demoted you for joking about it? Sounds like a washed up old shitter. Time to start looking for a new guild m8

---
2. Disagree. Promotes shenanigans and makes it interesting imo.

3. Good idea.

4. Nah. Makes choices more important.

Don't worry boy, maximalism heals himself with aging
---
When does it start?
---
I would like to think that the top firms in the United States with the most capital with which to command and attract the best financial minds our nation (and globe) can offer would be proponents of the most sound economic policy there is available.
---
To he clear I do absolutely think these companies are at fault and should be held accountable, but the economic and political systemic forces which let these companies behave this way needs to be held accountable and change as well. 
---
I wouldn’t say it’s a matter of fault, these companies are *technically* doing why they are supposed to do in a capitalist system - but that’s exactly the problem. They, and the system need to change.
---
Your problem should be that Blizzard having vague rules then. Not they get to enforce those rules. Your assumption that they are doing this for profit is unsubstantiated.
---
How do you kite the innkeeper?
---
This is extremely ironic given the protests in HK are primarily capitalists fighting for the right to exploit others
---
So now they are promoting the image that fighting for democracy from a communist party is wrong?
---
Grab your pitchforks!
---
Much love to you from the USA. We're with you. FUCK BLIZZARD.
---
I am ceasing all subscription services with Blizzard and uninstalling all Blizzard apps from my phone.
---
Goodbye Hearthstone, etc.
---
It's only "bitching" when you disagree with what the person's saying. If that's the best take you've got then I'll take my "bitching" elsewhere.
---
Where did I say any of this? The original poster quite literally said “Mages have it sooo much easier than rogues” and rogues have no aoe. This was in reference to getting invited to groups. Rogue vs Mage AOE was never a debate in this thread...
---
OMG they took my advice!
---
This is the real question here.  How many people are willing to boycott or risk other things?
---
I usually have them on my mousewheel (up = Berserker, down = Def, click = Battle), so I'd say just try in the settings if you can bind the "keys" from the controller. If not, there should be plenty of software to map the controller input to  key presses, which can then be set as keybinding in WoW.
---
You should get a wifi adapter and tether to your phone. You'll bypass all the restrictions on your local network from your employer and they won't see any of the traffic.
---
Are you suggesting that it's impossible to operate a business morally? That'
---
Remember folks Blizzcon starts on Nov 1st and runs until the 3rd. Plenty of opportunities to ask Blizzard employees questions about Hong Kong and there personal stance, should be very uncomfortable for all presenters. Twitch stream is going to be pure entertainment
---
This is insanely ignorant.
---
I always max particle density because it makes enchants and spells look better, ground clutter his horrible in my opinion, anything past 5 is just overkill.  When you put it on 10 you are basically just saying "who cares what herbs or quest items are on the ground"
---
How does it feel to play the game on easy mode?
---
That's the thing with mmos though. You're *supposed* to use all advantages available to you to get ahead of the competition. It's inherently a game of competition to support the illusion that you could potentially be the best. You can't blame people for taking advantage of what is available to them. As a simple example, say Blizzard offered a 2x XP weekend. Many people would vehemently argue against them doing it, but would still take advantage of it because it's silly to intentionally limit themselves. It shouldn't be put on the player to limit themselves in order to enjoy the content more. MMOs hinge on the illusion that everyone is on a level playing field with equal opportunity with the only variable being time. Obviously this isn't everybody. If they made a single player version of WoW, some people would still play because they can enjoy themselves this way, but i'm sure most wouldn't.
---
Over the past 15 years the world has shifted into more of a minmax culture whether you want it to be or not. It's human nature. I don't blame the people, I blame the availability of information from the internet and online databases. No game can combat it anymore except for purely procedurally generated content, which has its own downsides.
---
Coordination of raids is way more satisfying than doing bogus quests imo.
---
To my humble tanking experience (5 man tanking druid), pet is not an issue as long it does not pull mobs.
---
Buffs are always welcome. Debuffs are also nice (mostly for 5 man groups), but you need to use them only after a moment of time, when the tank has got a bit of aggro on every mob pulled.
---
Brooken tooth does not have extra dps, does it?
---
how did he willingly break the rule? go find the rule he actually broke and take a look at it..
---
But in this case the Streisand Effect from China's perspective only applies to the rest of the world. China has such a tight grip on their own internal image that they dont care what the rest of the world thinks. 
---
China knows they are way too economically important to most developed nations that nothing of substantial value will be done to them from external players
---
By not giving Blizzard money, hopefully?
---
Cancel your subscription(s), let blizzard know why.
---
Share the story, make it known, suggest others follow your example. 
---
Put simply, the way to help is to make sure blizzard doesn't get away with this.
---
If Blizzard is pressured to stand up for **basic human rights** and against **authoritarianism** the result either:   
---
* Another large company takes the right side (basic human rights is the right side, there's no discussion) and the Chinese government lets it pass. Weakening Chinese's power of propaganda and subversion.
---
* The Chinese government blocks Blizzard from the Chinese market, and millions of Chinese will be left wondering what the fuck just happened, and **many of them will go looking for answers and find them in places the government do not control (i.e. the truth.)**
---
Like many of you, I came back to WoW via Classic and enjoyed it a great deal.
---
Like many of you, I can't stomach this level of kowtow from an American company so desperate for profits it puts it above the ideals I cherish.
---
Unsubbing will occur today, all Blizzard's games and launcher will be deleted. After 20 years of fandom, I'll never spend another dime or another second on their products.
---
US should show that it can also exert pressure. Ban Blizzard from North America for being puppets of the Chinese government. If they like China so much, go and live there, we don't want them here
---
Uh, what?
---
CTRL + Tab will cycle through friendly targets

Yeah man cancelling my sub as well. You have my full support from Canada. I can't believe how fucked this is and how much we've just given to mainland China.
---
I'm not saying you are wrong. I just feel differently. I wouldn't mind not having the option to reset. Maybe just 10 minutes to change the last option, because of misclick.
---
My reasoning is that you plan a character and keep it that way, like diablo2. I feel more connected to it and rli make alts for different roles.
---
But I'm an altoholic, so, that's me.
---
I feel like saying that the casters were "just being there" is a bit misleading. They clearly knew what he was gonna say and ducked their heads before he said anything, then they started clapping and giggling to what he was saying, and yeah, the guy did actually break the rules, that's just a fact.
---
China is harvesting human organs, but who cares as long as companies continue to rake in money using pretty much slave labor. It would be so terrible if China banned these companies from getting blood money or letting them steal their IP to make shitty phone apps no one will play.
---
This is a very welcome change. I always hated browsing online or checking in game to get the preferred time zone, so it is great to see it in one place!
---
Private servers still exist just an fyi
---
Hire em DBZ!

I've never been asked to put my pet away.  I've been asked to turn off my pets taunt, (growl), a few times though.  I got much better at remembering later on in the levels though.  A hunters pet is a large piece of their DPS, no group is going to ask you to put your pet away.
---
When I played my hunter, i went with strictly cat.  The utility a particular pet offers vs. a mob, goes largely unnoticed.  The utility a particular pet gives the group, (the wolf buff, for example), is noticed.
---
3 Rules for hunters
---
1. Keep your pet on passive.  Order  him to attack your target.
---
2. If your jumping down cliffs to shortcut to somewhere, dismiss your pet before doing so.  Your pet will take the long way around, every single time, and aggro everything on the way.
---
3. Turn off your pets taunt.
---
I would swap Impale for imp OP.
---
I don't know why Blood Craze says 12% in this calculator too, it's 3% over 6 sec.
---
Maybe this explains why my ping is higher than normal. Playing on an East server when I'm in the West. Or it's just because Comcast sucks..
---
I'm with you. They aren't doing AQ gate event or anything. Itemization in the game is already at a point where all current content is completable far easier, faster and earlier then what real vanilla had. The fact that MC is cleared, with 0 FR, in groups where half the members aren't even 60 is proof enough of how much of an impact the current version itemization makes.
---
DM doesn't really change much at all. When people hit 60 instead of having to run 2 different endgame dungeons they can now focus on this instead. The current content will still be cleared just as easily as it has been.
---
I really think people are over reacting far too much.
---
You can always vendor gear. So just use it and sell it later.
---
I did hit 60 standing in front of the King, but now I just feel like a poser...
---
Did they say anything about the libram enchants?
---
It's because none of these moves are calculated for how the outside world views them, purely for internal control. China has basically confirmed in recent years that as long as they don't rock the boat too much outside their own borders, nobody is going to seriously check any actions they might take internally. All this internet censorship is aimed at securing their domestic online ecosystem with the long term goal of ensuring domestic support. In other words, they don't give a flying fuck that elsewhere in the world, the first thing that pops up when you search Xi Jinping is Winnie the Pooh. What matters is that in China that it's blocked. That attitude is likely to change eventually, but for now...I highly doubt that the CCP doesn't understand the Streisand Effect. It's just that they dont care about it because they've decided that it's not relevant for their current goals.

Use the site and put in your gear. Especially hard question for druids without more info because BIS could be more healing, feral dps, or feral tanking. I ran it recently with my 36 druid and it seems like there are a few highly rated items in STV at the end of the animal mastery quests.
---
Well I'm also a warlock, so I know about the mount quest. I just don't care.

So is Blizzard now a communist tool too?

Blizzards: Do you not love money from China?
---
Keep growl off and go with the wolf. Enemy casters will cast normally no matter the damage(at least that's what I've seen). If there is a shortcut in a dungeon (the gnomergan jump) dismiss your pet cause it'll run to you and pull the entire dungeon
---
it's not bBbbbBiIiIiSsSs for anyone, so you won't make a fortune.

it's a fine 2H weapon for any class that can equip it. except hunters.

---
I've had to take just about every healer I've had aside and just be like, "I need you to stop wasting your mana on my HP bar."
---
Because for some reason, they really want to just use greater heal when I tap to 50%. Shh. Relax. I live at this % HP. It's going to be okay.
---
Just toss me a HoT. I'll be fine.
---
10% owned by tencent. Does that make it Chinese?
---
Prior to 2001 we had laws that prevented Chinese businesses or the Chinese government (which are essentially the same thing) from owning US companies partially or completely.
---
It's easy to go back to that.
---
Yes, to me he was not trying to be sarcastic at all.

But he had a lot of downvotes, so several people didn't like what they read for some reason. There are answers mentioning "salt".

Yup. Added them to my boycott list with EA.  I was pretty much thinking about doing that for Activision anyway, but not many of their games soak to me.

Really gotta give comedy Central some credit for giving them the greenlight to do basically anything they want on that show. It's pretty impressive.
---
Blizzard doesn’t support china, they enforced their own rules for their own tournament that were clearly written and ignored.
---
I have been sayin that this is the only outcome of these companies accepting Chinese money for years now. but oh no, I was the racist for implying China would do anything like this
---
Don't use the link. Call blizzard support. Make them spend money cancelling your account
---
The thing you're describing sound great in theory but as soon as you growl a run away mob everyone and their mother is gonna type: OMG PET GROWL! And this ain't even a joke. Just find a guild that does 5 man dungeons and you won't have to worry about those kind of things and do as the above person said.
---
Not just Americans. Funny enough, a lot of people have issues with harvesting organs from living people

I hope you dont wear shoes or clothes or use any electronic or eat chocolate or oil or use any medication or the internet like fuck dude you cant get outraged about everything all the time.

I pick my battles and support causes that are important to me and go home and sometimes play video games. Fuck me I guess.

Doesn't matter, all Blizzard software has already been removed from my devices. Fuck Blizzard, and Fuck China.

Agreed.

But blaming authoritarian censorship/corruption on capitalism is stupid.

The gist is some high end competitve gamer won a championship, then in the post match interview or something, mentioned supporting Hong Kong protestors so Blizzard yanked his prize money and banned him for a year because they're a big fat China shill.

Because nearly every class can use a staff so you're able to enchant once and share with all your alts. Plus it's a broom on fire.
---
I find it useful for a random quick heal to a person who's not in my group. For casually healing dungeons, I find it *much* easier to select targets based on F1-F5 to cycle through.
---
I'm not sticking around to wait for it to happen with wow, blizzard hasn't been blizzard for 11 years and if you're an American company willing to silence democracy over someone standing up for basic human rights you can go fuck yourself.
---
So Blizzard is just as spineless as the NBA, huh?
---
Never would've guessed
---
This is more for loot, but just like I don't roll on bows if the hunter needs, at least ask the warriors/rogues before rolling on a weapon that might be better suited towards them.
---
Generally for dungeons whatever pet you prefer is fine. For raids chances are your pet will be dying constantly anyway so a wolf is your best bet as they can just hang back and howl constantly to improve group DPS. A wind serpent is also good for your personal deeps.

Isn't it EU, where "tips" are included in the receipt?

Going on their stream and pushing a pro Hong Kong agenda damages their image. No one watches hearthstone to see a political boxing match. That is not the time or place, and exactly why the rule is there.

If you are 60 for a weeks you have played an absolute shit ton, there is no two ways around it. I am a Single Guy, no kids, Full Time job, with dogs that I actually walk and take care of.

Thank you, you are a positive force in the world

No where does he mention that, are you just projecting your Insecurities?

Because they don't care about what the outside world thinks. They only care about sending a message internally.

People should also know tencent owns part of reddit and quit here too if they really care.

Why can't we start here, you know, giving up an Entertainment good that doesn't really matter if we have it or not and seeing if other companies fall in line.

You tellem champ

And in one fell swoop blizzard lost a ton of customers

You have been subscribed to Cartman Facts.

Ah ok, thanks for clarifying. I will make sure to delete my 60 and start levelling from scratch so you dont feel left out, I'm sure everyone else will do the same. Cheers!

If they'd released MC with proper tuning and folks actually had to gear up in regular 5 mans, it wouldn't have been cleared in the first week and people wouldn't be getting bored.

Ah well. Beaststalkers set is trash anyway, bring on the hunter crit gear from DM North!

Theyre a corporation providing a platform. They can do whatever they want. But this is why we should reign companies in and stop allowing them to have so much power.

You're right, but that doesn't change the fact that this would be a relatively easy way to make a stand, however small or insignificant the effect at an overall level.

This.  Cannot upvote enough.

I'll usually use it to tell me how many quests there are and decide on my next target, then do a quick check on wowhead or somewhere about which quests you pick up elsewhere but take you there...hit the major cities, grab those quests and then spend a day or two cleaning up that zone.
---
This needs stickied.
---
The best thing you can do it stand up to businesses like Blizzard and  the NBA that acquiesce to the demands of The Chinese government.
---
Boycott those companies and raise awareness of the issue with your friends and family.
---
So we are all boycotting China...since obviously they are much worse.
---
No more "made in China" in our homes...hypocrites
---
Yeah I am no longer supporting Blizzard. Been loving their games since I was a kid. Somehow, two decades of loving their games doest make this decision difficult at all.
---
You blew it, Blizz.
---
Right, CHINA needs to correct their behavior. Blizzard wants to make video games. If an actor makes a comment it’s possible China wouldn’t allow them in to the country. If China doesn’t allow Blizzard in to the country, thousands of Blizzard employees lose their job. Blizzard is looking out for themselves and not trying to take political stances, especially on a topic that will drastically impact their business.
---

Yes.  Every bit of that is a self imposed restriction.  None of those things are necessary.

Dunno about anyone else but I know that I'm not coming back. They fucked up the game I loved playing for years so much that, even without this for a reason, I quit. True, I wanted to come back despite that because I still love the game, but after this I'm just not going to bother giving them another chance for the tenth time.
---
The game in question - WoW - been in a constant state of decline for 3 expansions and they just don't give a flying fuck about player feedback. I love it enough to let that slide but I don't love it enough to let both that and this absolutely disgusting fiasco slide. I'm out for good.

Should I even bother applying to a raiding guild as a freshly dinged 60 or should I farm some pre-raid BIS first?
---
Why did they fire both casters who were not involved in the statement? They are literally fire bombing the entire situation. What a shame. I remember playing Blizzard games when I was 8 years old and have dumped lots of money into that company in the past. Never again. It sucks that I have to cancel my WoW Classic sub, but I have to do it.
---
"Pretty ok" is kind of sad compared to what it used to be. Why are you upset at people complaining? Complaining is what got us classic wow back to begin with. Complaining is why any major balance changes happen. If you don't tell developers what you want, they aren't going to give you shit. Yeah it is tedious seeing the same arguments over and over, but that's the point. That's feedback hoping they will make the gamer better than "pretty ok".
---
Bleh, good advice, I just hate it.  I haven't really ever done a warlock in a dungeon, is there ever an expectation their pets are not brought out til asked for?  
---
I might do a halfway version - ask at the start, saying "My pet will be on passive with growl off the entire fight as a default.  Let me know if you want me to growl to pull agro off the healer or stuff like that, and you might occasionally see it standing beside me cause I don't send it in to fight all the time.  Is that ok with everyone?"
---
Identity theft
---
Nope definitely playing a priest specced into searing light. Explain why i should take improved renew or healing focus? Per my logs with my current raid composition renew would overheal more then not, now it's about perfect, and how often in raid am I taking attacks that will cause interruption while casting, very very limited. People can judge all they want, but once they see the capabilities they understand. When they see me hit 350-400 dps on a boss, then at 50% mana able to swap off and help the healer out, they change their mindset quite a bit. Will this work for everyone hell no it depends on what is needed in your dungeon groups, or raid. I don't pug as a dps, if i pug I heal. I only dps with guildies or if we have a 4 man guild group and 1 pug, and it all started when guild needed 1 person but as a dps and noone was on but me and we all said f it just cast dps abilities.
---
Definitely not looking for a disc priest on retail. Every other talent has been pushed into the core healing build, just 2 points I found to be kinda filler points went else where and it works.
---
But this is part of the problem, is the fact that Chinese investments do cause companies to actually start caring about Chinese politics, we get it here in Aus where students at UQ were sort of told off for protesting about the Hong Kong mainly because they’ve got centres there with funding from China.  And of course China is going to get away with what it wants because it’s past the point of caring about its reputation, because people now care about their reputation with China instead. Which means China can do what it wants and will continue to get away with it and then the question is how much further will it go?
---
i hope not.
---
Just canceled my sub and uninstalled every blizzard game I have. Fuck commies. Fuck liberals. Fuvm blizzard.
---
People in my guild don’t get summons to raids. If you’re not there in time to not need a summon you’re late. Lockpicking and soul shards aren’t comparable anyways. Warlocks don’t need to farm if they drain soul before something dies.
---
Awesome, thanks again man. I dropped looking into critical theory, as it felt a bit circle jerky for me. But certain authoritarian/greedy corporate bull shit has got me thinking more and more about the meta thinking over this
---
I don't understand that either. The player most likely knew what he was doing and the consequences, but without knowing what role the casters played in it this is really hard to explain. I don't suppose there is a transcript of the original interview anywhere?
---
Fucking disgusting
---
Just poking fun at your mana comment that’s all no need to defend yourself.
---
It's messed up, but yeah at least somewhat understandable.
---
But then they also fired the announcers who did absolutely nothing wrong. That's the biggest problem.
---
I rather be new to reddit than take /r/politics seriously.
---
You poor sad person, I pity you.
---
Note: Server economies actually vary massively.
---
Blizzard gets gobs of money from China, and it's obviously what their new Diablo Mobile app was targeting, and China doesn't f*ck around when it comes to censor ship. 
---
They'll hang their grandmothers in the public square to prove their loyalty to Chinese money lest risking having their properties banned there.
---
When Hitler invaded the rest of Europe, do you know who else unsubbed? The French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir, SubmersibleGoat?

Those gears will be outdated nonetheless. Gears from dungeon are to be replaced with better ones. Anh if you have been farming for gears for the last 3 weeks, I think now would be ideal time to upgrade your stuff, don't you think so? 
---
Anh I still keep my opinion, it's just a middle dungeon between 2 raid tiers. It's not the end pf the world like you are thinking. People will still raid MC and wear its gears for the epic feeling. There is not much content to do from now on up until BWL release

Anyone else up for chanting "Free Hong Kong" during their main presentation at Blizzcon? 
---
Getting the whole crowd to chant it would certainly send a message. Can't remove EVERYONE there.
---
It's not so much spamming swipe as it is spamming maul. Maul is the main threat generator.
---
&gt; This is not in any way about Blizzard not wanting politics in their e-sports.
---
WoW is huge in China and they don't want the Chinese government to think they support the \#FreeHongKong movement and risk all their games getting banned from being played in China. This is exactly what "not wanting politics in their e-sports" means and is for.
---
&gt; This is not a "whatever" case, this is Blizzard actively siding with an authoritarian regime, this is Blizzard caring more about the potential loss of the Chinese market more than the death, torture, and harvesting of tens of thousands of Chinese.
---
Exactly, that's Blizzard caring more about their shareholders than they care about a political issue that they have no relation to, whatsoever.
---
&gt; This is not "just a game".
---
WoW is just a game. If you think canceling your subscription is somehow making a statement and supporting Hong Kong, you're just a delusional SJW.
---
do you play mage?
---
if thats the case I can tell you that theres exactly 0 good loot in dire maul so you can simply pretend it doesnt exist, the only thing mages get in diremaul is lvl 55 water.
---
You want to switch to two hand completely at level 40 when you can get Mortal Strike. Until then, mix it up while leveling if you want.
---
Any sort of mafia was reported on one of may realms, at least for EU. With devilsaur leather spaning from 3g to 20g depending on realm and faction it's not a game level problem that communities can create monopolies or corporation-alike structures. As a mage that had skinning I got like 80-100 devilsaurs during visits to Un'Goro... and they still just walk casually not bothered excessively ;)
---
3. Even on pserver with 48/52% faction balance the BG or War Effort participation balance was totally different. Amount of players of given factions doesn't always linearly translate to given faction activity in given aspect of the game.
---
4. No. Vanilla forced compromise or forced players do the extra effort to afford respec. As a mage I'm in a deep frost build with winters chill. I can AoE while in raid I'll do less damage, even buff other mages, especially those arcane/frost mages - they can't AoE, have less survivability but see big crits I can dream of. Dual spec would take away that impact of your build choice.
---
I'm also surprised by the low number of rogues. I feel like, on my server (Kromcrush - Horde), rogues are the least abundant class. It seems like for every rogue, there are eight mages.
---
How is that edgy?
---
Same thinking here, video games shouldnt be platform to describe their politics views.
---
He get what he deserved.
---
They won’t unsub at all. Just complain and pretend they’re freedom fighters lol.
---
Go back to retail. (I joke)
---
I agree with you that capitalism has its faults but its ability to quickly respond to market forces is one of its finest qualities. For example, if we put pressure on Blizzard to change it is likely other companies will begin following suit. Already a blizzard competitor has offered to pay the prize money and has invited the player to their 500k tournament.
---
&gt;Actually cancelling a sub and boycotting is not virtue signalling..
---
It's not virtue signalling apparently, but...
---
&gt;it’s valuing humans about some entertainment that can be replaced.
---
That's exactly the virtue that you're signalling by cancelling your sub and posting about it online. You're not going to have any sort of impact like you're hoping for, and merely doing something to make yourself feel better about it and let other people know what you're doing. Basically what you just said is "It's not virtue signalling! It's just signalling our virtues!"
---
While I personally agree with you and see where you’re coming from, who, in that case, do we hold accountable for decisions like these? The CEO, sure, but it can’t possibly end there. A decision of this magnitude.
---
My suggestion to get a more realistic overview:
---
In this guide: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/engineering-profession-classic-wow#classic-engineering-fast-leveling-1-300-guide
---
You will find an ingredients-list for every rank. Now check your auction hause for pricing and do the math.
---
Good luck!
---
Or maybe Blizzard wants to reach a worldwide audience, not just isolated to NA/EU/CHN ?
---
Never hurts to try. Worse that happens is you are in the same boat, not in a raiding guild
---
The rhok is significantly better.  People never factor in lag or the fact that a single mistake tanks dps for the bow but hardly impacts the rhok.

---
For starters, cancel your sub and tell them exactly why you are doing so.
---
Where is the data on that (??)
---
BRD is typically the earliest of the dungeons, but at 55 you can do any of them as a healer. Remember, healing is different than any other role as the level of the mobs doesnt restrict your ability to heal the way it restricts the ability of tanks/DPS to do their jobs. Literally the only differences between healing a dungeon at 55 and healing one at 60 are; (1) you may not yet have max ranks of your healing spells, and (2) you may not be able to bypass mobs that 60s might due to aggro.
---
Time to go back to private servers. Fuck Blizzard
---
Real talk: Is this even legal? How can a company just revoke money that belongs to you? Or had they not paid out yet and are now refusing the payout?
---
Oh fuck off that is bullshit.
---
Yeah, I've been attempting to respond to you but I don't know why you feel like I'm responding to a different question.
---
Their response does feel premeditated and contemplated. They decided to be transparent instead of trying to be hush-hush. 
---
If their intent was truly political, I don't think they would have done this publicly.
---
I unsubscribed this morning and copy and pasted all of that as my reasoning.

Blizzard trashlord, after fucking 24 years with Blizzard, EVERY GAME SINCE Warcraft 2, i never trash talk blibli, even with their trash talent at optimizing their games, i was never a hater, i have literally thousands of  goodies and now here i am i have deleted all my games, and my [B.net](https://B.net) account will shutdown soon if nothing is done, i even write email to Esport service and customer service, ME THE FUCKING FANBOY. The only politic they care is the Politic of money, what is a democracy crisis in one of the most important place in the world ? A LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S ALL
---
I mean I’ll cancel but not letting that money go to waste.
---
Activision-blizzard is partly owned by tencent, a Chinese firm. So it’s less cozying up and more China being China; the only people being burned are non-Chinese consumers.
---
I was poking fun, it wasn't a serious comment.
---
I got lucky prelaunch when they flat out said Bigglesworth would be a West coast server before launching it. But I gotta admit, these tabs would have been crazy helpful earlier.
---
Who has time to wait until level 3 to use heirlooms?  /s
---
Don't forget to uninstall windows and burn your computer because some parts of it comes from China. Also burn your phone and TV if you have one.
---
Thanks! So tier 1 is essentially the best gear available right now and the tiers go up as new content is added?
---
Ah well, it's one of those comments that you have to Poe's law without a /s.
---
S'all good, have a nice day :)
---
I agree somewhat with what you’re saying. But using the word “edgy” in this context is completely wrong. It’s a person standing up for a country, if that’s the correct term, and their democracy and independence. That’s not edgy. That is just being a good person.
---
That's correct. In reality what you're looking for is "top end damage" - so when you look at a weapon's damage range (let's say 125-150), what you're looking for is the biggest number. A weapon that's 125-150 at 3.9 speed is 35.2 dps, and a comparable weapon at that same level might be 75-100 damage at 2.4 speed. On paper, the 2.4 speed weapon looks better, because it's 36.5 dps, and that's higher than 35.2. But the calculation that the posters above me are referring to skews it in favor of the 3.9 speed weapon because it has the "top end damage" of 150. Make sense?
---
You are correct that speed itself is not the determining factor, but it is a good "at-a-glance" metric for determining what the top end damage on weapons will be, since weapons typically have comparable dps at a certain level.
---
:)
---
All the more reason to uphold American beliefs and allow freedom of speech. 
---
People aren't being lynched in America. They ARE however being unlawfully detained in Hong Kong so this dude should be allowed to speak about it. Dipshit.
---
Clip of the interview? Or is there a transcript or something?
---
I cancelled my subscription and deleted retail and classic from my computer.  Blizzard won't get any of my money anymore.
---
They share the same leadership now
---
Like I suspected true to the sub you like to make wild claims completely devoid of truth, and you refuse to back them up with the slightest bit of evidence.
---
This is /r/politics behavior, and you’re a political hack.
---
Pathetic
---
Says a mage
---
It's easy for them to be spot on: This is nothing new. Watch most of the blockbuster films in the past decade.
---
See a Chinese location? See a significant form of Chinese participation? That's likely subtle advertisement for the Chinese market, because of Chinese investment.
---
Pacific Rim, The Dark Knight, Transformers, etc.
---
Need an Asian villain? fallback to North Korea.
---
Dude, they're removed for reposts. Read the damn rules, lol
---
What does that do?
---
I don't think it is a human right to earn money...?
---
You res with low hp. So maybe it just seemed like a big hit but you were already at like 30% hp to begin with. Or maybe he hit a windfury proc that apparently melts people from what I've read (I think that's what it's called. I've never played a sham)
---
I'm not arguing politics at all, so you're wrong. I'm saying take it the hell out of gaming. I haven't offered a view because gaming threads are not the place to discuss it.
---
If your boss says don't talk about politics at work does that mean he's taking a political stance? No, it means keep that shit out of work.
---
“Work and social life.” I also used this one. I loved raid leading but “had” to stop. Nope just another shitty girlfriend that demands money and to do only her interests while calling your own hobbies destructive or weird. I would much rather watch the Fucking notebook for the 15th time and be compared to Ryan Godling the entire time, then having the privilege of being denied a pity HJ until my birthday. Much rather do that than have fun with my “loser internet friends with no life.”
---
Before I continue destroying the pathetic logic you are using, can you show me some proof that half the subscribers in vanilla wow were Europeans? Thanks.
---
The Chinese have phones and would like to buy Diablo Immortal. If Blizzard allows something like this to stand they could be blacklisted from their biggest market. Dollars before democracy /s
---
I’m playing with my wife, she’s never been more than Sims player and s few other games like that.  She’s loving it.  The biggest thing has been to let her set the pace.
---
This text. Twitch chat. Blizzcon.
---
Speaking with my wallet, what's the difference to you?
---
Higher level -&gt; more gold you earn.  
---
Around level 45 quests will give ~1 gold reward.  
---
Stop worry and play the game. If you get your mount at level 43 - nothing will change.
---
forgive my ignorance but wouldn't this just hurt Blizzard? It wouldn't do anything to Hong Kong, it would just hurt a company who refuses to stand up to them?
---
Weird that she’s Part of the USSR. I just thought she would be a CCP member.
---
He kind of makes a point though, other tanks handled the fast pulling well without complaints and issues but you are struggling with it, he couldve been less rude about it but still, as a lock I life tap alot in dungeons and not once has a healer ever bitched about it EXCEPT one time when a holy paladin did have a problem with it, I called him out the exact same way your GM did calling him garbage and shit at his class and saying he was the only healer thats ever complained about it, he left the group quickly after that so idk, I get where you are coming from but I also get where the GM was coming from too, its all perspective and its almost like the GM was waiting for someone or anyone to act that way so he can rant the way he did
---
Just wait for the inevitable edgy questions at Blizzcon being answered with tear gas and rubber rounds as Chinese police storm the crowd to protect the precious Diablo Immortal booths no-one’s standing at, haha
---
Blizzard’s sole discretion is literal shit.  I’m sorry to all Blizzboys playing hearthstone and overwatch but blizzard games have turned to shit.  Not only are the games shit, the companies management is shit I ho also happens to approve of sticking Muslims in concentration camps and oppressing millions of people.  Good job blizzard.  Let’s not forget about the No Balls Association for their approval of Chinese censorship. 👍
---
Don't waste money on alts.

Biggest tip.

---
I trust the inclusion of one of the official mouthpieces of the chinese govenment counts as accurate for you? The CCP isn't exactly ashamed of the fact that the party's media censorship bureau doesn't like LGBT shit.
---
It's a waste of thorium, only get the wrist recipe to keep leveling with after 275
---
Shhh, don't give Winnie the Pooh any ideas.
---
Shameless Plug https://dernperkins.github.io/DynamicCam-Classic/
---
That’s how it should be honestly, I didn’t know what to do at first, I thought about mentioning it to the guildmaster but I didn’t wanna seem like a child lol. 
---
But I made real good friends with most of the guild and been real involved with everyone, mostly everyone knows he ignores me now and they all agree it was dumb in his part lol. I don’t think he’ll last, he’s kind of a dick even in chat. Especially to lower levels.
---
I don't see the resemblance at all, but I'm going to keep on calling the fucker Pooh because it bothers him
---
&gt; now everybody in America knows him as the Winnie the Pooh guy
---
True, but how many Chinese do and are willing to say it?
---
None.
---
Except those who disappeared. Who were they again?
---
Censorship works when you have complete and total control of the government, press, media, and the internet, *and* you're willing to kill.
---
She probably didn’t even when they were together.
---
Hey a really important tip I realised when levelling an alt is that if you level up your character, his level will increase, until you reach level 60, which is the max level in the game.
---
I mean to be fair 500k is a good sum of cash. I’m sure this wasn’t their on goal.
---
You're welcome!
---
Yea I know
---
Well I’m kinda noob in reddit and I see everyone doing it, is it inappropriate to do this?
---
True, but I thought they were releasing PvP titles and such in phase 2, is that supposed to be in Phase 3 as well?
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Lots of people say "Follow this guild" and the guide is just dumb. These guides are based around power leveling a profession using the minimum amount of materials because they think that will result in the lowest cost. They are right for certain levels but entirely wrong for others. You can make a bunch of deadly blunderbus(horde) to gain about 20-30 levels and make money from that level range. Same goes for gyrochromatoms, salt shakers, and a few other quest related items.
---
Cheers
---
Never dropped below. You sure? What are you 1% and 0.1% frame times?
---
I play at 1440p with a 2070 super. There are areas I regularly drop down to 90 to 100 fps. Though that tends to be a CPU bottleneck rather than a GPU one.
---
Looks like ffxiv is back on the menu boys, hail web culture!
---
Now I feel like a fool. Going to have to try this when I get home.
---
What level do you need for mithril?
---
Best advice i can give you is to watch your gold output - be extremely picky about the abilities you buy as they get very expensive in your 30s. Second, if you want to maximize your gold intake I strongly recommend you have skinning. Especially considering you are about to spend a lot of time in STV! The question is really - do you want to make 2 extra silver from every mob you kill or not?
---
Just canceled as well.  Here is what I wrote in my explanation to them:
---
&gt;Your abhorrent decision to ban Blitzchung and rescind his prize money is too much.  I cannot, in good conscience, continue to support a company that puts profits ahead of human rights.  To be clear, I do not expect you to be political.  But your decision was not apolitical; it was kowtowing to a political regime that abuses its people and crushes dissent.  You can have their money.  You cannot have mine.
---
Priest in our guild linked healing meters unironically saying he "won" on a fight.  I'm leveling a warlock to main switch because I'm so not gonna deal with our healers being idiots lol. I'll just hit 3 over and over and be oblivious instead.
---
The capitalist wet dream

&gt;And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:

---
I've been using this site:  [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)
---
It'll never happen, but I would love if blizzard would post stats a month from now showing what percent of the people who mentioned china in their whiner box when unsubbing came back within the month. Bet it's over 95%
---
I mean, a castnet would be my default assumption, given its the most likely variety for corralling a land based infant.
---
How does releasing level 40-50 level dungeon shortens the game lifespan?
---
Yeah, honestly it’s been a concern of mine for the last 2-3 weeks. I just couldn’t figure out a way to navigate it with a positive outcome.
---
The logic being that you have no stance to criticise others for not joining your silly video game protest if you continue to support things that are much worse.
---
I never ask for a tip but I almost always get at least 30s. Sometimes 1g. So Andy where in there seems to be fair market value.
---
The Chinese market is $$. A huge population and the government doesn't mind if you invade their privacy... Infact, they encourage it!
---
I regret rolling my two professions.  I went herb alchemy.  If I did it again I should have went mining skinning, dropped skinning for blacksmithing after farming UBRS.  Then once PvP is released, dropped mining for engineering.
---
Leveling isn't amazing. It's doable, but it's somewhat slow. The best way to describe shaman leveling experience is "The worst mediocre leveler, or the best bad leveler". They have some get out of jail cards that the worst levelers like warrior don't, but their sustained damage is sub par and for a while they're weapon dependent like a warrior.
---
You level 1&gt;40 as enhancement shaman, and then a lot swap to ele shaman at 40 or so. Endgame you can either play deep resto for mana tide, but give up solo content viability. Or you can play the 30/0/21 ele/resto build and go mana tide-less for raids but be significantly better in solo content.
---
Overall I love the class. It's incredibly strong in its prime of utility healing or burst damage in pvp. It's weaker in pve damage but can still pull off 5 man endgame dungeons tolerably with downranked LB if the occasion happens. In an absolute pinch it can grab aggro if the situation calls for it and tank a bit better than most classes since you'll probably be using a shield.
---
Blizzcon is right around the corner too, This is a really shiity thing to do to a guy just trying to support his people.
---
That’s because the United States won’t blacklist them and remove them from their largest market.
---
As a mage with so much CC, you could just nova blink and poly. All barely use any mana. Plus mage is more overpowered than shaken in my opinion
---
The seller has no idea what it's worth, and that's why they want to put the ball in your court.
---
On both sides, people are trying to avoid making the decision of what the value is.
---
That’s awesome. I can’t wait to be dumped.
---
Literally all you said was “but other companies bad too??”
---
And no, I’ve never seen another developer ban someone for non offensive political activity
---
that might be a hard one to find, I'm guessing the s-13 stands for season 13 and I imagine there will be a crap-ton of videos with 's-13' in the title :( 
---
If you keep asking around and describe it as best as you remember I'm sure eventually it will click with someone and you'll get a link
---
I rather they just did TBC because you know you'll enjoy it. Plus I like the arena.  I don't trust blizzard to get it right with new content for a classic +.  It will just end up being a fancy slot machine just like the last few expansions.
---
Pathetic, but considering blizzard has been catering to china since the creation of WoW im not surprised this is only the latest event of Western companies showing off the shoeprint of china on their backs.
---
lol healers spend 30 minutes looking for tanks on my server they sure as hell are going to let the stupid aoe dps die and leave the group before they piss off the tank.
---
Just cancelled my sub at work this morning, used maximum character amount to let them know how I feel.
---
Warlock's get asked to put their imp out, and asked to put the felhunter or voidwalker away. It's ranged and less likely to pull. Also it gives a stam buff to the tank.
---
Warlock's (as well as hunters) are also expected to know when to put their pet away for jump's and such.
---
That is a note I didn't add in my original post, a Hunter (and warlock) is expected to know weird pathing obstacles that may cause a pet to go to bad places. . .even if you haven't run the dungeon before. Depending on how friendly the group is, if you are new to the dungeon you can ask "Hey, never ran this before, can you guy's give me a heads up if there are places I should dismiss my pet." Assuming you have it out.
---
Which realm?
---
let's bankrupt blizzard
---
You're supporting the US government doing similar things by purchasing pretty much anything here. We have immigrants in camps along the border, or did everyone here forget about that?
---
So, as of this post there are 3247 posts in the thread. If ALL of them are unsubbing from WoW, that will be about 0.065% of the subscriber base (based on a guess of 5,000,000 subs for WoW and Classic). Yep, gonna make a huge difference.
---
Even if this tread hits over 10,000 comments, just a drop in a lake.
---
Mats aren't free. The gathering takes time. The value of that time is the price of the mats.
---
Ergo, selling anything under cost price is insanity.
---
Join a guild in the meantime until you're ready to make a big decision! Have some fun don't let it get under your skin my man &lt;3
---
Yeah - at least some of the other stuff I can see as corporate profit-motivated stuff, but this is really, really nasty bad PR.
---
I get they have a lot of players in China, but they don't outnumber the rest of the world put together.
---
I'm seriously considering cancelling all my subs over this, this isn't okay.
---
Stranding them was not even the worst. Hotels and other Airlines charged them the full costs of their stay/flight again, even tho they already paid Thomas Cook when booking their holidays. Just because they were not sure if Thomas Cook will really pay them, what they can't because bankruptcy. So some people had to pay twice for their holidays with no chance to get the money back from Thomas Cook.
---
&gt;Which you just chuck on your hand and control as the show happens, an animation has to be fully voiced and everything before it airs
---
Puppetry involves more than just sticking on a glove. Have you never seen how the Muppet movies are made (for example)? So you have to get the puppeteers, the cameramen, the lighting crew etc all in the same place at the same time and then get all the voice actors etc to perform the script that the script writers just rewrote for the umpteenth time. Whereas Southpark is basic animation written and voiced by a couple of people.
---
...through the now-terminated contract he didn't abide by.
---
&gt; Shareholders are normal people like you and me just trying to have a secure retirement.
---
Not the shareholders with any serious value or power. You know perfectly well that people are talking about large shareholders when they speak like that and not someone who has 4 shares or something.
---
I’ve been playing blizzard games forever now. This is the end for me. I’m tired of people folding to Chinese censorship. I’m more than happy to tell Blizzard to fuck themselves for this
---
Can you elaborate? They're one company.
---
Just ranting, sorry x-x
---
According to The Verge, the casters egged him on.
---
I'm cancelling, as well. Fuck Blizzard.
---
I know it does not making it right but they are protecting a money train. Diablo was not made for a western audience it was for China. 
---
Last thing they want is another company to fill in the void they would leave should their games be banned in the country. 
---
They think this bad PR is totally worth staying in China. I say prove them wrong and get these kinda of posts pinned to the top of multiple reddits.
---
It has little to do with direct insults. It has to do with image. Blizzard is only concerned because the Chinese government can see this as their games endorsing a highly political situation against China.
---
It *does* damage the brand, but Blizzard hit that red button super hard.
---
Precisely.  Hence why painting this as apolitical is wrong.
---
You’re a 1 year noob? It’s just stupid to give your sob story and then turn around and do an awards speech thanking everyone.
---
You really only get battle chicken and death ray so its not a big deal
---
Fuck Blizzard and fuck China.
---
i'm horde on Razorgore and its mostly us on here. Allies are few and far inbetween.
---
They’re a company. Stop expecting companies to give a shit about you. It’s not going to happen. Talk with your wallet if you actually care.
---
Using any major companies' platform for political opinion is always looked down upon by the company unless it's what the company want's to stand for. This was an unfair position to put Blizzard in if they didn't do anything they make a major statement if they do something they make a major statement it's a loss either way. They likely didn't want to make a decision on this at all. They chose the one that makes sense as a business. People are the ones that are politically charging it.
---
I love classic but I refuse to support this bullshit anymore.
---
Uninstalled bnet.
---
Do you think that if he spoke out in support of the CCP that Blizzard would have let it slide?
---
You know what? Don't act like this is some microtransaction BS. I have played Blizzard games since the original Diablo, and I just uninstalled all blizzard games on my PC and phone.
---
This is so absolutely disgusting.
---
Please. Please do this. I am not joking. Make. This. THE thing.
---
If you're a tank that doesn't need anything from whatever dungeon that is, and you're in the middle of whatever you're doing at the time... why shouldn't you request compensation for your time?
---
Like strat live. It has nothing for tanks. That's why first orb goes to the tank.
---
In my opinion all wow expansions sucked because the approach was faulted. 
---
Starting TBC everything you did before was rendered worthless. You would find better gear on boars than your T3. All the reputation you grinded no longer served any purpose… Basically all that mattered now was TBC content. 
---
In my opinion TBC zones were ugly and other additions to the game sucked such as resilience, arenas, daily quest, flying mounts…
---
Blizzard should have gone with the Everquest approach (at least on with its first expansions) which was to add dungeons, raids, content, stuff to do… but keep the same level cap so that all previous content was still relevant and worth doing.
---
For classic I wish Blizzard would just do that : add QoL such as dual spec, new graphic engine and also new dungeons / raids.
---
&gt; and a more consistent gold farming method
---
but with the gold inflation the farming stays pretty close in value.(with the exception of respect to respec and NPC costs)  The gear, materials, and consumable cost is going to drastically increase.
---
Booo blizzard!
---
And that shit is fucked up and should be called out for human rights violations.
---
B-but I like Winnie the Pooh. :c
---
It’s the spirit
---
I was discussing DM runs yesterday with other warlocks. Are you suggesting lasher runs is around 60g/hr, or another DM method? (If lasher, are you adding herbs to the 60g/hr number?)
---
Is there still a legit private server we can all go play on?
---
But it’s literally the only thing we can do.
---
This is like saying one vote doesn’t count much in an election
---
Extremely torn on this. I love these games so much, and my friends are all on them. But supporting China against HK is fucking reprehensible. You have to be absolute fucking slime to support China’s efforts here, regardless of how much money you may lose. 
---
So it should be a gimme to unsubscribe, since I don’t want to be absolute human garbage by supporting them, but then you think that it won’t actually make a difference, boycotts usually don’t work, and really all I’m doing is denying myself something I love to make no difference whatsoever. So it’s a tough decision.
---
Hard fucking kapp
---
i'd instantly sue their ass
---
Vote for what?
---
I vote Yay
---
I saw tons of Mithril Ore in Searing Gorge yesterday, I think a lot of people go after Dark Iron there to help them level and will ignore Mithril.
---
Tee Hee, oh Winston TIBET HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF CHINA
---
Or just stick to the schedule?
---
Nobody should go to Hillsbrad at 20.
---
I gotta watch that ep. I have heard about it soo much in the past 24 hr.s
---
Don’t be stupid
---
I used to love doing this on my mage when Blast Wave had a knockback.
---
/r/enlightenedcentrism
---
Unless you're retarded, succubus will do the most damage, and you have the option to seduce patrols or casters until the tank has time to deal with them. If you want to be brainless and can't control your pet, then imp. :P
---
The UI is a tad too cluttered for me
---
Niiice. I have a crypto podcast with some friends and we talked about them before going to make sure they get some love this week
---
Are not a sheep was a typo.
---
The same fucking thing happened to me... made devilsaur gauntlets and they were gone from my intentory until I reloaded
---
Shaman + ravager warriors is slower but still pretty fast. Not sure if there is enough warrior density any more at that level to make group finding consistently easily.
---
Good tanks can hold both np if its only Blizzard, AE spam is a different story.
---
And if they can't it's not a big deal. Everything will die in a nova anyway, shit gets done faster and the only some warrior tanks ego will get bruised because "only tanks are allowed to hold mobs"
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Nice one.
---
Likely posted too soon. This would work well as a strategy to get people who are done with Classic to try BfA out, hopefully retaining them as players long past the Classic content. We'll probably see it come officially later on when there are more 60+ casuals that hit cap and aren't interested in raiding.
---
Only way out of Moonglade is through the Timbermaw Hold, or via a FP that takes you to Darnassus. The non-druid FP wouldn't work without connecting FPs.
---
That's exactly what happened.
---
15 years ago when I first hit 60, I took a very long time...I think I took easily 6-8 months. Granted - I was very wishy-washy about which character to level. I didn't stick to one, I kept on creating new characters, wanting to try everything. Today it's a very different story of course, but I think I'm at 7 days played and I'm still 54...definitely a lot of wasted time.
---
It was a bit of a ramble on my part, but when I see people here who say they're not hardcore - but have been raiding MC for the past several weeks...I think a bit of perspective has been lost here.
---
I think I'd just like to see these same people, those who say their server is chock-full of guilds who have registered Rag kills, that 60's are everywhere they look...to just be honest with themselves. They are hardcore players, not as casual as they seem to paint themselves as. I think we talked about this earlier, but in my mind if you:
---
- Login and play everyday, for several hours a day
---
- Are level 50+
---
- Know what gear to look for and why, and have resources bookmarked to refer to
---
- Have some kind of goal in mind on what you'll be doing in the next few weeks and specifically *devoting time to the game*
---
Then you are hardcore.
---
This has been true for like the pest half century though.
---
We need people to show up to Blizzcon dressed as Pooh.
---
Speaking as someone who isn't 60 and doesn't have much +healing yet: It'd still be nice if locks didn't life tap in lieu of post-pull drinking so often. Tanks often pull if the majority of the group isn't sitting down, and it's kinda lame feeling like everyone's waiting on me.

This is the dark side of capitalism.  Morality is thrown out the window in the name of profit.
---
The electoral vote only applies to the President, who have very little power.  The senate is who you want to vote for.  
---
Also, just because it’s popular doesn’t mean it’s right.  There’s just as many problems with going with the popular vote as there is with the electoral college.  
---
Term limits for congress and getting the right congressman in office is the best solution at the moment.
---
Welp! That's the last penny Activision and Blizzard receive from my household.
---
lmao so continuing to play wow or blizzard games is ‘pissing on human rights’? Your insanely fucking delusional dude. How about you throw away your smartphone and most of your clothes cause with your logic you’ve been pissing on human rights since the day you were born
---
Minus 5% for commission fees or deposit if it doesnt sell.
---
Really? I was under the impression that only warriors had a taunt. Huh.
---
The community has spoken! Wish granted! (starts drawing furiously)
---
It’s not. The meme is repeated multiple times in this thread - just go down from the top collapsing comment threads as you go, and you’ll see it time and time again.
---
The thing is, they did it in blizzard programming.  Look up sinead o'conner at saturday night live and tell me what u think about it.  Was it wrong or right?  It's almost the same thing.  Time and place, and to force Blizzard to choose a political side when they probably don't want to? It's just torches and pitchforks all I'm saying.
---
I guess I'll be going back to ESO.
---
Thanks for the nostalgia hit.
---
When I get home, bummer since I just got my mount but at the end of the day it's just a game
---
Same. Never again touching a blizzard game
---
lmao, fucking armchair activists
---
if you really cared about the people of china, then stop buying chinese products. noone's going to pay $3000 dollars for a smartphone of course, so nothing is going to happen, so yea, instead, lets generate fake-outrage by pretending we wont be playing Classic anymore. nevermind that we'll resub by the time this fake-outrage has died of again
---
Holy shit they put the sub on private. This is hilariously pathetic. Or else terrifyingly sad. I can't decide which is stronger right now.
---
How mature of you.
---
Fury prot DW does more threat than druid.
---
Why anyone would play on pve is beyond me.
---
It's not so simple as one of you being right and the other being wrong.  This is a fundamental dissonance in Western culture: how do we support human rights while also supporting capitalism?
---
You can try to break things down as simple as you like, but there's no analogy that's going to capture the complexity of ethical capitalism/finance.
---
EU has way more stringent rules, as a whole, concerning freedom of expression and speech. What timeline are you living in?
---
God bless Matt and Trey for standing up against this shit.
---
It isn't. If you don't own property, you're poor and not happy.
---
You very clearly have some prior investment in being wrong seeing as you picked a single line and completely ignore that this was a blanked regulation under the State Administration of ***Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television*.** It's obvious you aren't actually interested in any real discussion considering your lack of willingness to provide any evidence of your own, do any research, or even remember current events within the past few years, but have some more sources as I leave:

Also for a american reaper skin in overwatch they made his skin black. When his skin tone is normally much lighter. So wierd
---
I thought stance broke fear itself?  Isnt that where stance dancing comes from?
---
I think the most OP overall would be a warlock.  
---
SL/SL warlock with Ruin and all the other talents would just be stupid beyond belief. It'd effectively be a tank with the highest burst in the game outside of 3minute mages/ele shamans that also has healthstones/regen/bres.
---
Ha! Me too!
---
Im not saying they are wrong.  But to expect a private business to pick a side shows how childish and ignorant you are about how a successful business runs.  Doing so would be business suicide and shouldn't bash them for being business savvy.
---
And this is coming from someone who hates blizzard for the most part. I have a blizzard account whose email address is blizzardsucks1986. Im not a fanboy
---
The NBA thing is actually crazy there isn't really a reason why they should bend to China, besides the money, especially considering the NBA being one of the most socially progressive sports leagues in America and they constantly try and push that image. So it makes their stance on China even more disingenuous.
---
The response from the south park guys is just them being themselves I wouldn't have expected any other type of response from them as they rightfully don't give a fuck. And the even sadder part is the millions of Chinese people who where probably fans of that show now hate it due to a small slight directed at their country.
---
China is a buttmad insecure country 10x worse then any American SJW or Bible thumper because both those groups could probably watch a south park episode making fun of them without getting the government to ban the show.
---
Yeah not by the same person sorry people think the same shit is funny.
---
Companies put $$ first before all else.
---
Don't spend money on Blizzard products at all, if enough people do it, and they can see it in their financials then they will change their tune. Blizzard's revenue comes from America 50% and Europe 35%.
---
Grind dungeons until 35 on the plus side you will have better gear and money towards your mount. At least at 35 you will have a chance when it all kicks off with the ganking.
---
What are you trying to do, point out hypocrisy? Because it seems you misunderstand what it's all about. It's not about *Chinese* influence per se, it's about *authoritarian and undemocratic* influence. There's nothing wrong with being Chinese or using Chinese products. Indeed, as you point out, it's very hard to avoid doing that in today's world. So please, dial down the tribalism a little and focus on the actual issue.
---
This be the big true true.
---
Similar situation here in 2012. But FIFA did not get much hatred back then.

Way too much going on here lol
---
Literally why diablo immortal is a phone game. Asian market is big on mobile gaming
---
I would also like to know the guild name if that's okay
---
Ui looks good to me
---
Should be:
---
- Go back to retail, kid
---
- Go back to retail, boomer
---
This is not realistic, 98% of the time you don't even know wether the companies you're supporting buddy up to china or not and there's just no way to check every single time you buy something or use someone's product or service. And even if you did, most people would still choose the cheapest or the best products instead of the ones by companies with a stronger moral compass most of the time. 
---
Also the sheer amount of companies trying to please china is gigantic, a lot of the time you don't even have that much of a choice. For example, you wouldn't be able to use many or most of the websites and electronics you are using right now and there's a good chance that you are forced to use them through school or work.
---
The free market is just horrible at solving problems like these as long as it's so profitable to do business with China, why is it so hard for people to understand that?
---
Capitalism alone does not give a fuck about what's morally right, you need some form of regulation if you want people to go against their financial interests to do the right thing.
---
Ok
---
Thanks was able to find a few.
---
So are you guys going to stand up to blizzard with your wallets on this ?    I’m going to go with no
---
I just cancelled my subscription to WoW because of this.
---
This has me to the point that I am debating whether or not I want to abstain from using blizzard and Activision products until blizzard rescinds their decision. 
---
I do not believe that my own entertainment is worth continuing support of a company that undermines the core of who I am philosophically. And I believe in supporting the Hong Kong protestors. I believe in supporting the basic right of voicing ones opinion, even if that opinion is political.
---
It easier to let your kid be quiet and sit in front of a screen than it is to engage them and parent.
---
I’m uninstalling my bnet client when I get home. No fucking way, Blizzard.
---
awesome. thanks for your help!
---
Absolutely!
---
Elder Scrolls Online PvP is pretty fun, I typically don't enjoy PvP in MMO's but in that game I do.
---
I honestly couldn't even bring myself to play Classic last night after seeing this shit. I've given this company thousands of dollars. It's disgusting.
---
The blizzcon classic preview was legion, live classic forked from BFA, so it does have the improvements.
---
Yeah that's what I mean't, the experience on a whole is flawed and quite dull
---
Just cancelled my sub as well. Fuck this.
---
This and the NBA shit in the same week. Wtf is going on
---
KNOCK KNOCK OPEN UP THE DOOR ITS REAL

Don't forget to delete your Reddit account too. Can't be using a website partially owned by Tencent, if you're truly a person of principles.  
---
And good luck on getting everything refunded lol
---
The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared martial law and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre (Chinese: 天安门大屠杀), troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.
---
in what whey did they chose and commit that hostility?
---
I uninstalled wow and canceled my subscription as I was just about to hit 60. That’s how mad I am against Bli$$ard for putting aside all moral in order to make money
---
Thanks. The first one works for me.
---
Not an exploit, existed back in vanilla wow. The recent bannable exploit involved layering which wasn't possible in vanilla
---
Do it!
---
Unsubbed from WoW this morning.   
---
Hit them where it hurts.
---
Most annoying part of reddit. Not every sentence needs a fairness injection. Just say your point.
---
There's two versions of BRD/LBRS maps, one is basically what it looks like in-game and impossible to read, another has layers split up properly and seems fairly intuitive. I think originally Atlas was showing the crappy map and AtlasLoot plugin the good one, but after updating both seem to have the proper version.
---
Wait the guys account is deleted now, wtf is Reddit in full damage control mode right now?
---
Why would you get a refund?
---
So they want to censor their player base and allow harm to come to the people fighting against human rights violations and demanding a better quality of life? What a bunch of fucking pieces of shit. I was literally just about to download an update and jump back into hearthstone after a couple of years but fuck that now. No more overwatch either. Never thought a videogame developer would be involved in political oppression, but here we are.
---
Blizzard’s continues capitulation to the Chinese government makes me sick.
---
What if all the western pro players started saying the same thing, and. And just wow, overwatch. 
---
Make them fucking squirm.
---
This was done by all horde power leveling groups who needed to level in stockades attempting to reach world and server first, so if it were anything actionable, blizz would have made it known by now.
---
Assuming the reason is Hong Kong but they're never gonna give their money back.
---
Ah yes, the "I'm such a shit healer I can't keep the whole party alive so I'm going to act like a diva" thing.
---
Learn to play.

Horde. Fairbanks. New WoW player looking for a casual/social guild. Currently level 39, warlock taking my time through content. Eventually I’d like to try to raid and pvp. Really interested in finding fun people to play with who aren’t terribly concerned about min/maxing. An active discord channel would be nice as well
---
This just in- company that makes an entire wow expansion to pander to china panders to china
---
shitty.ass.policy.
---
They literally advertise their Open Beta right below it. (They'd be stupid not to)
---
How many people knew about it before the tweet? I'd bet it's probably far fewer people than now.
---
It's a decent mix of doing good and benfitting from that good. Like when people do a good thing and brag about it on social media. They did a good thing, but they arguably did it for bad reasons, but they still did a good thing.
---
but now we have to change tabs for people who play on multiple servers but don't care about east or west...
---
I know that feeling :&lt; I didn't get my epic land mount on my healadin until well into TBC (started playing day 1).

Why would they refund anything?
---
Best. Idea. EVER!
---
MEI: THE NEW HK SUPPORT HERO!
---
It's absolutely about political retribution.
---
Instead of Blizzard taking a stand, they've chosen to cooperate in oppression.
---
I don't own property. I work as a programmer and have passive income. I am happy.
---
What, exactly, are you expecting to be refunded for?
---
Nice, maybe you'll be able to hold threat in a year.
---
I'm starting to collect preraid BiS gear as a hunter and I'm still not used to trading stats for things like hit percentage.  I get the logic, but it hurts lol.  My thinking right now is that as I'm adding +hit % gear before cap, I try to get as much Agility, even maybe at the expense of other stats, as possible.  Is that thinking correct?
---
Hey Blizzard, you should have taken notes from Matt Parker and Trey Stone after their South Park episode. You greedy fucks
---
Get those disgusting jagged arrows out of here. Buy some thorium for that thing you peasant
---
&gt; Not sure why people think blizzard is pro china but that is still going on. Hey we dont want people using out platform for politics. Some pro " fuck china" blizzard "good bye idiot". 
---
That’s simply an incorrect oversimplification of what transpired. Take a look at articles that go over exactly what happened, and your paraphrasing may become more accurate.
---
If a business owner can't afford to pay their workers at the start, they shouldn't start a business
---
If a business doesn't make enough money to pay for it's workers, the business should fail
---
Restaurants in every other country in the world can afford to pay their workers and it's not as if [the US is cheap compared to everywhere else in the world for food either](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Cost-of-living/Restaurant-prices/3-course-meal-for-2#-amount) (and that's not even including the expected 20% tip)
---
So, sure, educate me, my question is why is it okay for american corporations to front the bill to the customer, as a brit tipping is extremely foregin to me and the more I look into it the more it does seem like "muh CEO's" especially when big name restaurants that do make the big bucks with millionaire CEO's expect customers to tip
---
***Illuminati***
---
This. They're also selective in how they want to view 'politics' in their games. Only standard set by them seems to be whatever China wants.

---
Good one, except you're ignoring the replies where I've said I support the guy and condemn the atrocities that are going on in Hong Kong, and ask people to write to their local representatives to speak out against China.
---
There's no education to be had here. Just don't fall for the misinformation that Blizzard is an Angel and Activision is the Devil.
---
Blizzard was never the benevolent corporation you pretended they were when you were a kid.
---
&gt; and that the proc is a genuine hindrance.
---
That's a great point. Forget about using Gouge with Bloodrazor. Definitely correct to just sell it.
---
Change, no matter how small, has to start somewhere.

I like how people are so upset they need to find a template to be able to properly express their “personal” outrage.

Ah, I didn't level a warrior at launch. Not until later.
---
Found the DPS who doesn’t understand how mana works
---
The US government won't take a stance on HK given our spineless Cheeto of a leader, but please know we the people see what you are fighting for and wish you only the best. Most Americans want to help but we just aren't sure how.
---
Aggro meters were mandatory in my guild back in the day. My brother was a warrior tank and he'd tell everyone to let him get a couple of sunders on the target before we start dps. One thing I hated when tanking is when you mark targets, tell players to attack your target and then they attack something else. No one starting after Cata knows how hard it was to hold aggro back then because iirc, tanks got a 500% threat generation boost to threat generating abilities.
---
Hmm, you mean how reddit is part owned by tencent?

Mirah's song - scholomance quest rewards- and the chest is Deathrattle Chest from Scholo?  I don't remember off hand!

Man I love overwatch, but I refuse to support a company that values China sales over human rights. Fuck blizzard.
---
Good mods are good
---
Not gonna work my man, blizz may lose 100,000 customers from this but in return they maintain access to the billion customer Chinese market. What's more important to them?
---
Youre saying either the feral is doing way more tps or the warrior takes more damage. Now, in my books high tps is good and taking a lot of damage is bad. So by what youre saying it seems reasonable to assume you are presenting ferals as the better tanks. Or do you want to take the "yeah, but warriors have shield wall" joker?
---
Speaking against oppression is a personal belief like speaking against drunk driving is a personal belief.
---
Imagine being a healer and thinking you should not heal people.
---
Hy shit these people are delusional.
---

---
Cancelling my subscription today, told to my gaming group about the reason.
---
It's so fucking sad, I've got more than 2 years in /played only in wow and I'm huge fan of both hearthstone and overwatch. 
---
Blizzard, your games are full of heroes who act against all odds to save the world and do right thing. And yet, you choose to side with China out of fear to lose profit.
---
And F1-5 can be used to quick select party members in descending order.
---
Horde is filth.
---
When is a good deed ever not good PR?

I definetly am. The drawing will be done before the end of today. ò w ó ✨

It's a shame. I wanted to play but I have to cancel now because of the Hong Kong thing.
---
More money than what they might lose after this story negatively impacts their brand?
---
Do you understand that your cynicism and flippancy is making the problem worse so that you can feel superior?
---
I deleted* my battle net account the minute I head about it, there are so many good games out there not made by soulless assholes.
---
*yeah, it will take few days to process the request but its pretty much like deleting it
---
I just sold all of my Activision-Blizz stock. Fuck them.
---
At that point why not let them skin it for themselves?
---
Imo having instant attacks makes rogue feel a lot smoother. Yeah you’re squishier but if a mob is like 20% you’re not waiting like 3.3 damn seconds to maybe finish it when you can drop a 3+ cp evis or just a SS or SOMETHING. It at least feels more engaging for most of the leveling til arms gets stuff like 36+
---
Don't forget Destiny 2 (it's more of an mo than a mmo but it just came out on steam for free and has many mmo elements including 6man raids)
---
Do you know the exact clauses in their contracts that they were fired for ?
---
NBA
---
Imagine being such a shill that you automatically assume anyone who doesn't immediately believe Blizzard is a perfect corporation that would never do anything wrong must actually be a secret Activision shill.
---
No it's not. You could vote for politicians that would put sanctions on China until they stop their human rights abuses against the people of Hong Kong and force American companies to stop doing business with them until then. It's an entire country's wallets vs. just your one wallet, which do you think is better?
---
Adherence to the rules absent of any context or analysis is authoritarian.

Fuck off with your bullshit. If someone wants to make a change in a way that matters to them, who the hell are you to say it’s not enough?

&gt;i cant even afford enchants **or lionheart helmet**
---
lmao ... 'i cant even afford a 600 gold piece of gear, woe is me!'
---
What could Blizzard realistically even do to appease people in this situation?  It's 100% possible that China would just disallow Blizzard to have their games available in China, that isn't a hit that any gaming company can take, especially one that is traded in the stock market.
---
I disagree with what China is doing, but I don't blame Blizzard, nor do I think it is their place to "take a stand" against China.  It sucks that they "had" to ban a player, but they really didn't have any alternative other than not allowing him to be interviewed in the first place (which in hindsight if they knew what would be said i'm sure they would have done).
---
Riiiigggghhhhhtttt... Not the authoritarian government that is crushing every civilian that opposes it, and has done since they seized power...
---
is Elemental farm even considerable as warrior? 
---
I played with the thought of doing herb/mining but without the addon doesnt work / dont know how to set up that and brining herb to 300 takes also a while 
---
Nah the guild wants greater fire mungos,greater arcan protect potion,buffood,dense stones and that every week which is so expansive that i'm always on the 10g mark because i cant farm anything except in the nights,but then they also want enchants and soon lionheart helmet as must i mean i consider leaving the guild but finding another one is kinda difficult
---
Is that one of those big nets they use to catch birds? you could get a bunch of babies in one of those.
---
That is exactly what happened they dont want people using their platform for politics unless its from them it is not so rip get fucked.
---
Ok I'll trust a chinese spammer on a random subreddit then!
---
The Streisand Effect is where an attempt to hide or censor information results in the information becoming much more widespread.
---
China and Blizzard are trying to censor this interview and the position given in it, and because of their attempt WAYYYY more people know of the interview than before.
---
I had no idea this interview occurred or what was said before this. Now I know and so do millions of other people because of this. Streisand Effect.
---
What a shitty fucking move, seriously. I can't fucking believe they actually did this - did they think it would garner them *good press* in the West? Like they just massively violated their own rule.
---
Fuck china
---
will do!
---
Had Soulkeeper drop yesterday, and while it's definitely an upgrade for me now, should I use it? Nearly 54 so will be on the hunt for BiS soon which will replace it, and I'd definitely be able to sell it
---
Am druid healer
---
Love how people think their sub matters. Especially classic players. They dont need your money, retail bets way more beyond subs
---
So I’ll cancel my sub AND vote in 2020.
---
Are you dense or just trying to argue for sake of arguing?
---
Every little bit helps pressure companies. “Death by a thousand cuts” is a saying for a reason
---
Good for you. Out of the 20 people that I know that went classic. Only ones who had it right at 40 we’re the ones who stopped to farm a bit or dungeo grind instead of leveling. But good for you?
---
Well, yeah, you’re making 39 people have a worse raid as a result. Glad I’m not in a casual guild!
---
The comment I replied to said you can’t have your cake and eat it, too, this situation. They were referring to both supporting the people of Hong Kong and, in general, taking a stance against the CCP while continuing to give money to blizzard.
---
If that’s the stance you’re taking, then you also can’t consume any products that, in any way, put money into Chinese-based businesses.
---
Sorry you struggle with basic reading comprehension.
---
Feel free to reeeee and call me a shill though, lol.
---
Its ok it was only added 3 years ago.
---
Nah Stoneskin over Redoubt any day
---
The old raids aren't instantly irrelevant when a new tier comes out like in retail though. There were guilds still running MC while Naxx was out in vanilla
---
I decided not to give them any money over a year ago, and having been paying with tokens using stockpiled gold from their broken retail game. I will not be giving them any more money once this runs out, due to this action.
---
Lmao what would enlightened centrists do if South Park didn't exist
---
Blizzard has been getting shitter and shitter and the people that made blizzard great have all been leaving over the past 10 years leaving only the brown-nose toadies running the games.
---
Except for the Overwatch guys, which seem to have created their own little enclave of anti-suck.
---
If Blizzard says they aren't being influenced, there's no way you can trust that statement because if they *are* being influenced they sure as fuck aren't going to admit it. What's actually happening, however, strongly suggests that Activision have been fucking with them since day 1.

Blizzard is a gaming company, not the moral police. Don’t be upset that companies act in their best interest when it comes to politics that could damage their business.
---
Reddit is up there with Google too, just not at their scale.
---
Mickey Mouse returns and both him with Disney and Randy with 'Tegridy are trying to break into the Chinese market. China is reluctant until Randy and Mickey team up with Randy using piano wire to decapitate Winnie the Pooh to gain access to that market.
---
It's possible, but I don't want to be 'that guy' who ends up making dungeons take 3x longer trying to play a class/spec with quite a lot missing to work effectively (no taunt, no active mitigation cooldowns, poor threat generation and survivability when compared to other tanks)
---
Good knowledge, side note: what is the portal at the center of the zone. I swear I discovered it back in like 2005 when i was running around. They never used it for anything and is just a dead zone that you have to run around.
---
Definitely not bis.
---
Of course ,they don't want China to censor their games, they just released diablo for phones just to appeal to chinese mobile gamers
---
I was considering the old /s, but made an executive decision. I failed.
---
He works for Blizzard.

There is a massive difference between saying “reddit is owned by Chinese company” and “a Chinese company had a small percentage of ownership in reddit”.
---
A pro Hearthstone player got banned for a year for saying Liberate Hong Kong on a competitive stream. He was also forced to forfeit the prize money he won from that competition. 
---
As such, all the people who have done absolutely nothing to support Hong Kong in the last four months are now going ballistic and unsubbing from all Blizzard games. [This is the post in question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dez4yc/breaking_blizzard_entertainment_bans_pro/)

As much as I am enjoying classic wow. I am heavily considering cancelling my sub over this shit. Pathetic Blizzard.
---
well I could not bring it with me but then i would not be promoted to raider status(without it no loot)
---
Fuck you bootlicker, they're all gone now.

But that was 2005 when there weren’t complete databases that know every single detail about the game.

Remove my comment? Then I'll say it again. Sad to see that /r/classicwow stands in support of genocide.
---
If you support China, you are supporting genocide and a totalitarian regime that is literally on par with Hitler's.
---
Blizzard and Blizzard China isnt even the same company at this point.
---
People don't literally mean it's the end of wow. They mean it's the end of the days where they could say it was a quality game. I've never seen someone with half a brain claim that the game was truly going to die, just that it will convert to a completely casual audience and lose a lot of its hardcore players.
---
You can always try reaching out to them by emailing support, and if that doesn't work do a charge back on your CC.
---
I don't,my morals died a long time ago friend.

Damn Blizzard really wants people back on retail to buy mounts.  Only reason to rush what content is left for classic.

I get some of the outrage, but let's be real. It was a bad idea for him to make political statements during a promotional event hosted by a company. He has the freedom of speech, but he isn't free from consequence. 
---
The rules aren't made so they only apply when 'you' are personally offended. It goes both ways, and some people are not happy with his statement.
---
Take your own advice lol
---
Thank you! If you want to do more to support us, please check this congress act

---
The Hong Kong human right and democracy act can hugely impact the current situation so please spread the message to other Americans!
---
I do this 100% of the time and I get a " ayyyy good move SourD ' in Discord every time by the tank LOL
---
TLDR: We can't piss China off. Also, we're pussies.
---
I'm not a tank tho
---
Technically it’s not, free speech and the right to say what you want is up to you but it doesn’t mean Blizzard has to allow it or stand by it, if it represents their company. 
---
With that being said, fuck Blizzard for having no spine and thinking about money over democracy.
---
I wish protesters would just lay down for the tanks instead of disrupting daily life of thousands of people.
---
If Blizzard only cares about profits, then they wouldn't have done this with the risk of people cancelling their subscriptions if they thought that it would have any affect on their profits. There is no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism.
---
Vote at the ballet box, not with your wallet. Vote for people that would put sanctions on China and keep American companies from doing business with them until they stop their human rights abuses against the people of Hong Kong.

So, if you're not maxed out at lockpicking, where do you get off asking for tips?  Shouldn't the skill up you get for unlocking lockboxes be the tip?

Not sure where people keep getting the notations of leveling quick equates to enjoyment.

A related question since you know what you are talking about. I have both, the dwarven hand cannon and hte crossbow from UD strat. Wich one should I use. I was doing more dps than other hunters in MC using the cannon (they used the crossbow) but I got the crossbow from strat and I'm now devating wich to use next raid.
---
Your right! Hes just another sheep in this mess. Every time someone takes a stand there is some fool waiting to criticize them. And for what? What do they get out of it?

Fuck China. Fuck that oppressive communist regime.

You need to relax, Misterblack8.

You're obviously right. The other guy just has the reading comprehension of a preschooler. He didn't understand the comment he responded to, and he still doesn't understand it. It's hopeless.

Reminds me of the old loading tip:
---
Take everything in moderation, even World of Warcraft!
---
Good response. I guess you only care about the opinions of people who agree with you or who do drink Coke, eh? :)
---
Yep, 5% is a pretty generous estimate
---
He’s actually asking.
---
I misremembered his level he's 59 my rule of thumb is 3 below for the tank or closer so it's probably a 55 56 run.
---
Because it’s built into the newer platform like abandoning a flight path at the next flight master.
---
&gt;Bank alt is a must if you want to avoid flying to the auction house after every quest
---
just lol
---
People are pricks, and this is much worse in cases where they won't be punished for it (ie. in a game).
---
Expecting free shit from someone else, sabotaging someone else, or just straight up insulting people for no reason are different displays of this simple truth.
---
I've already cancelled it dude. It's your choice. I personally find it hard to give Blizzard my money after what they just did. Completely done with them.
---
&gt; pander to china and keep the money, Genius! 
---
Funny that you're making this comment on reddit who also did exactly that
---
That’s actually correct. Even though I’m pro the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Pro Hong Kong liberation). There’s a whole pet of a country that’s against it, and it’s purely political.
---
Even though China mainland is doing horrible things to suppress the protests and all, its unfair to ask an outsider company to take sides.
---
And to top it all off, that player probably accepted the terms and conditions of participation, which was posted on the tweet above btw. So I don’t know what you guys were expecting....
---
Put your stolen quote away. There is plenty of context. He tried to use Blizzard as a platform to push his political agenda. Why did he have a mask like the protesters with him for the video? He knew what he was doing.
---
It’s likely a combination of windfury and purge. Purge is very strong vs priests because it removes your power word shield(and all your buffs). Combine that with a windfury proc (20% chance on hit for insta 2 extra auto attacks) and an earth shock.  Shamans can absolutely melt people if they are lucky with the WF procs.
---
That's just on you. No one cares about the pace you're levelling at and the release of a dungeon doesn't effect you in any way whatsoever.
---
Oh piss off
---
i don't get it, did he say in on the stage or did he say it in a tweet 2 years ago?
---
Tab targeting feels different than in Vanilla, where it depended on your character and could see through terrain if the mob was still inside of LoS. Now, if a mob is just beyond a hill and you dont see it on your screen, you cannot tab-target it. However, it becomes possible by simply moving the camera to see the mob.
---
It's annoying when you know you can cast something on a mob but tab-target doesn't want to select it
---
I cancelled my subscription as well.
---
No, I just don't care for your opinion. I doubt many people do.
---
Thanks for taking a stand.
---
&gt;It's just logical and understandable for china to act that way, they are only acting in their best self interest by trying all they can to polish their image in the world.
---
And this right here is something that is rightfully criticized lol... Are you defending censorship?
---
&gt;What the companies do on the other hand is just pathetic and oftentimes even unnecessary given that chinese investors would probably not pull the plug because of little incidents like these since they profit from these companies regardless.
---
So it's understandable for China to act in their best interests but it's pathetic and unnecessary for a business to do the same? Sheesh.
---
&gt;This whole thing isn't just any fair trade between china and these companies, for China it's a display of strength and for western companies a display of weakness.
---
&gt;China is fucking them in the ass in front of the whole world and they simply let them have their way, and that was very clearly shown in this episode. 
---
You know what criticism is, right? Strength or weakness are irrelevant. 
---
The episode was making fun of the fact that the powers that be in China are so fucking insecure that they completely scrub any criticism out of existence in their country.
---
It's not a trend that has just been recently catching on. It's inherent to the neoliberal capitalist system. There's not much we can do to change it without throwing the entire system out too.
---
Read the book Manufacturijg Consent by Noam Chomsky (or watch the movie, I think it's on YouTube)
---
This whole stuff with China is nothing new, it's been happening for time immemorial. The only difference is that China is upfront and clear about the rules, but in the West it's all subtle and behind the scenes.
---
&gt;s 4 or 5 levels higher than myself. The overpower trait basically makes arms warr a hard counter to rogue, especially if they pop evasion. I don't know if there is a way to counter arms warr on rogues, so
---
What i do against warriors is stunlock them for insane amounts of time using blind , restealth , sap combo into a second cheapshot -- kidney. If after that they are still alive i use vanish, preparation and redo the combo again. This is very min maxxish and requires all your cooldowns. But it is doable to just dab on warriors if you choose to do so.
---
I usually tip 50s, then open the box while in the party with them so they see what I got. If it's a nice blue, I'll open up and add to the tip accordingly. As the item is usually worth 1g+a few s I feel this is fair. I give them about half the value of the most likely item for the opportunity to get a good item
---
I’m replying to your comment that you wish carapace would require players to have the quest?

I am!

21 is not too far it might seem like it is right now but trust me it isn't.

Same.
---
China is *harvesting organs from dissidents while they are still alive.* They are attempting to take over Hong Kong, and protestors are *dying in the streets.* I really shouldn't have to link you to all the atrocities taking place in Hong Kong right now.

The absolute worst thing you could do is not care. If you don't care, you are no better than the fops who stood by while the Nazis took over Europe.

Don't forget to put Activision's name in with this. Thier in the middle of this too.

Thier name needs to be dragged through the mud.

I didn't say they can't roll.  But to kick others who want to roll, you're going to make a bad name for yourself.
---
No? Be mad at Blizzard.  The Chinese government isn't forcing them to do this.  They are making a conscious decision to put dollars over morality.  This is 100% on Blizzard. They are weak. They could take a stand on this, but they won't.

You're not wrong. This is why HK is important. The more we know the more we can attribute the violations on other people/places to our own immediate environment. HK is getting a lot of attention even though things like this is happening everywhere, and people getting worked up is fine as long as it gets people talking/thinking. China is a huge existential/military threat, just like the USA, and Russia. We are in war of the minds right now, and we can not afford to be apathetic.

 The people at the top worked hard to keep people agreeable and fearful. We gotta persevere man. Don't let the light die.

I also don't like giving him attention, I hate that I even posted this.  But I hate even more the fact that Blizzard is letting them set the pace for the rest of us.

Blizzard in 2020: do you guys not buy our games?

All of you internet revolutionaries better stop buying thousands of products as well if you're mad about human rights.

Stop eating palm oil. Stop wearing 80% of clothes from 90% of manufacturers. Etc.
---
How to make each damage i do appear as text like this? so helpful
---
Is that why you deleted your entire post?

Why not both?

It's just a massive exageration on your part. You chose to do other things and thats fine, but don't pretend you're trying to spend every spare moment levelling when that's clearly not true.
---
Kind of ironic that using cocaine comes with the weight of the human rights violations of the people who produce it, now that playing WoW now comes with the weight of the human rights violations against the people of Hong Kong.
---
Various media around the world has been pandering to the large market of China for too long because anything which casts China or their singular, fascist dictator ''party'' in a bad light gets banned from this massive source of customers. They have a literal propaganda department which ensures this.
---
The veil is lifting on Chinas bullshit. The people of Hong Kong are fighting for their freedom and I cannot in good conscience play any game which actively supports oppression.
---
Getting Classic WoW was honestly one of the best things to happen in my pathetic little life recently, but it's still not worth the freedom of people who live almost at the other side of the world.
---
Fuck you blizzard, you might be unlucky to be the company that brings this issue to a head, but you still do what you do and you still chose a bigger market over part of that markets freedom. I can honestly see world war three coming from this as various corporate entities scramble to pander to one of their biggest markets while individuals decide that their freedom and other people's freedom are comparable and therefore sticking up for the latter is a necessity to safeguard the former.
---
One more time: Fuck you blizzard.

Why do people need to post proof?  Proving that they did it doesn't impact anyone.  Either trust them or don't, believe them or don't.  That's up to you...only impacts you.  Hell, whatcha gonna do if the don't...ridicule them?  Follow 'em around Reddit and post about them not proving something?  It's weird "gotcha!" behavior.
---
No one is claiming to be a hero by just unsubscribing. People know that a corporation only cares about one thing and that's money, so they're doing what they can do about it. Be the change you want to see in the world, unless you're only interested in filling the internet with edgelords.
---
What the fuck is with what you and the two people above you are saying?
---
Do you see all those comments saying "I canceled my sub to send a message to Blizz" or "I refunded X preorder"? Do you know why they're doing that? They're voting with their wallets.
---
&gt;We all should feel a sense of pride and accomplishment at the achievement of capturing creative energy and turning it into a dividend!
---
When do you think WoW went downhill? Because any time before WoD you can go look at the sub numbers and see that OVER half the people from WotLK still played. The sub numbers dropped steadily, not all at once. Do you know why? Because of players who tolerated whatever bullshit Blizz or Activision or the shareholders or whoever tried to pull.
---
I despise this mindset I've seen people espouse that it's SOLELY on Blizz-Activision. Even now, people are saying "Vote with your wallets!" for this big social issue and I agree! I fucking AGREE, it's absurd that Blizzard is outright backing China here! That's why we need to stop paying them!
---
But guess fucking what? If not enough people do it, if companies don't lose enough money and even moderately-positive rep, they'll just keep backing China! The SAME thing applies for their development of games as well though. The reason they got away with all the shit they put into WoW after WotLK that people hated was because of all the complacent people. The people who didn't give a shit or who hoped things would get better without having to sacrifice their enjoyment of the game by... Just not playing anymore.
---
I hate how even in the midst of this awful situation with China people are STILL shitting on Blizz-Acti as the big bad greedy company they are and posting RIGHT NEXT to people saying "Vote with your wallets!", without the slightest iota of self-awareness that that same thing ALWAYS applied to WoW.
---
Where the fuck were the people voting with their wallets back when Cata was happening, huh? Cata, MoP, any sort of class pruning or time-gating or the addition of grinding? Are you seriously going to try and tell me that big bad GREEDY, MONEY-AND-SHAREHOLDER-FOCUSED Activision actually started losing money and didn't care? If their profits actually, legitimately tanked, you bet your ass they would've spun right around or doubled-down. But they didn't have to do either because of the amount of people who just accepted the shit they gave them.
---
If you want a relevant example of another game this is happening with, see Pokemon Sword and Shield. Even though there's no good reason for any amount of Pokemon to be COMPLETELY UNAVAILABLE at this point in time, there's still going to be a good amount cut from EVERY SINGLE game from here on out. And plenty of players are defending that. They're okay with paying GameFreak $20 more for less content because "buh muh fun".
---
That is what happened with Blizzard-Activision and WoW. ***I'm not saying the company doesn't have greedy, shitty decision-making people in it. Or that they're not doing their damndest to squeeze money out of the game. I'm not saying "poor old Blizz-Acti" is innocent, AT ALL.*** I'm saying that this notion that WoW went downhill all because of them is false, and I hate that people keep portraying it that way. It's fine to be mad at B-A for making greedy decisions, for trying to squeeze pennies out of players. But at least be mad at the fucking players who JUSTIFY those decisions, if you're going to tell people to vote with their wallets; be mad at the people who REWARD those greedy decisions being made with what the decisions were meant to elicit! People voted with their wallets for shitty, rushed-out expansions and mediocre, time-gated content. And people will vote, today, for the continual oppression of an entire country just because they're too obsessed with whatever damn game to take a stand in one of the most basic ways possible: By not spending money on a video game.
---
It wasn't that hard to do with WoW, it's never been that hard to do with CoD or any other game, and it ESPECIALLY shouldn't be difficult to fucking do with what's happening in China. I've got over 3k hours in TF2 and if I learned Valve was pulling the shit Blizz is, you bet your ass I'd never give them another cent. So what's anyone else's excuse? What's EVER been someone else's excuse for not voting with their wallet besides reasons you don't want to face?
---
Looks like you enjoy being the Jack of all Trades, well done!

I’m struggling with this too. I’m always sleepy and I come into work the next day miserable and just waiting for my next wow session. 
---
Last night I decided I had to put an end to it, so I’m setting healthy boundaries that work for me. I’m not going to play Monday-Thurs as I end up staying up too late. I need to go to bed early and spend the time on all the other things I need to do for myself and quieting my mind so I can sleep restfully. 
---
Anyways hope you can find a balance that works for you. I know that cutting something out entirely doesn’t work for me. We all just need the right healthy boundaries that work FOR us.
---
Im sorry what are you even saying? I meant it's a crime against humanist thought to censor someone and take their money they worked for.

I wouldn't recommend it, but if that's the way you want to go I guess all I'd add is that Blood Craze is essentially worthless, you could probably find a better spot for that talent point.

Not true. Only 13 of 41 servers have a single layer currently. The rest still have 2.

Really wouldn't recommend sneaking up and stealth opening while questing. That's A LOT of time over the course of a journey to 60.

Maybe after you get one character to 60... there are still all the other classes to play.
---
The casters brought it up. They said “Say the words!” Before running away from the camera. Watch the video!

If they were using my company platform 100% especially since were Canadian based.
---
If anyone had any expectation that an international gaming company with a large % of their market being in China, would allow someone to voice their support on said companies platform, then that person is an idiot. 
---
Blizzard, like many companies, have a pretty hard no politics stance for their public personalities, and their interviews.
---
They didn't ban him because they found out he supported Hong Kong, but because he did so on their time using the platform he had as tournament winner...
---
Because they are virtue signaling or karma whoring.

You're dead wrong. I just loaded up a 1.12 client on Kronos and it doesn't do anything holding down tab.

It's not about being smart, just about playing for years. It's not like you have to go out of your way to find this out. It is literally right in front of you every time you use your hearthstone.

I don't think those herb/ore prices will stay low forever.  I feel like if you got a jump on mining now by the time you level it to the high level stuff which will be more in demand for high level gear you'll make some decent cash.

And gathering professions are free money.  The gold is just literally sitting out there waiting to be picked up unlike crafting professions that require investment in training those skills and buying materials.

Just cancelled my sub and uninstalled all Blizzard products.
---
I did nothing but SM aoe runs from 30 - 44. With so many people questing in the really good zones it was taking forever to finish quests. I gave up and lived in SM for a while.
---
That's what i thought. My experience bar is blue for the last 10 levels.
---
WoW has always been in the same league as black tar heroin
---
More like "dont say anything that we, Blizzard, may define as controversial".
---
Just canceled my sub as well
---
I know, I've tried the same thing.
---
But to stay silent is capitulation. This issue isn't really on-topic an a non-Blizzard-related subreddit.

&gt; We need laws to prevent domestic companies from transacting business with hostile foreign powers.
---
We already do.  Some of them even apply to China.  For example, surplus firearms can not be imported to America from China.
---
Not surprising that people you hang out with would become attracted with the HS news.
---
I mean it sucks, but that's how any non-independent business works.
---
Well toooo be fair, D3 had a fucking real money AH that Acti-blizz took cut on every transaction.
---
Cancelled my sub as soon as I heard this. It's an abhorent level of behaviour, acting like a tyrant. If you want to play the Chinese market, fine, but you'll do it with one less customer.

I just played a lot.  I have a 60 warlock, a few MC pieces and mostly otherwise pre-raid BIS (minus anything from scholo or strat, because I hate those places).  And I just dinged 40 on my priest alt last night.
---
Install questie, lets you see where to go for quest concentration, and then after that it's just being knowledgeable and playing a lot.  And I did it fairly slowly too.
---
Depends on the level of the lockbox tbh
---
As I've mentioned before that's all fun and everything but when I'm a priest if means more downtime. I'm also the guy who has to rez and fort them which is basically most of my mana pool so I would rather spend a small portion to save you and avoid it.
---
I mean none of the comments in the reddit thread were remotely helpful or on topic. People can be upset about the Blizzard/Activision decision, and it's a super shit decision and they should be ashamed of themselves. But it has nothing to do with LoL or that game. Everyone complaining they didn't do an interview (they did) and a bunch of comments were simply not needed/relevant. There are plenty of other places to voice their opinions on the subject.
---
WoW Classic at least is a Blizzard game so has some relevant connection.
---
Imagine getting so infuriated at a video game you have to call a bunch of guildies to help kill some people who ganked you once and then proceed to corpse camp them for an hour. Sounds like you should go to retail man, this sort of behaviour is childish af (typical).
---
Go to SM, pickpocket everything in Lib, go to Armory, pickpocket there then by the time you're done the pockets of SM will have re-spawned. The boxes you get from them can lvl you up to 170, then you can buy the gloves (pretty cheap in AH) that give you +5 to lockpicking, which will allow you to open youre 175 boxes.
---
there are too many key quests that make you come and go to org
---
As OP is a shammy I’d disagree. 
---
Sure aoe grinding mages have some nice methods outside of quests, but running an xp/hour addon and doing all kinds of dungeon farm groups I’ve haven’t beat my XP per hour questing while using an efficient questing guide.
---
If you have a better option for OP I’m sure he’d love to hear it.
---
Because blizzard is more popular in China than here. Why would they let some edgy kid risk their tournament being broadcasted in China. 
---
They obviously care more about revenue than him and he shoulda known
---
Am I parroting if I didn't get this idea from anybody?
---
Yeah, the lockout circumventing was probably the biggest factor tbh.
---
Imo, if they intended to change instance farms then they would have nerfed ZF and Mara, any instance stealth farm rogues have (if there are any), etc.
---

Yep, I'm out too. I was Scatterbrain on Mograine if anyone I played with there wants to add me!
---
It's not about what he voiced support for.  It was because the action of voicing his opinion was a violation of his contract.
---
That's what I'll be doing from now on, thanks!
---
Which costs 2g and 40s a Stack! I'll just wait for the next Mage Water instead...
---
If politics shouldn't be in a gaming compatition then China should have a propaganda department which bans companies from being alloowed to sell to the Chinese market for making a game with doesn't show China in a favourable light.
---
China literally forced this situation and people like you just don't know what you're talking about. that's not an insult, I just mean you obviously have a very small pool of information on this which you used to make your comment.
---
I never said rules can't be wrong, or should be followed blindly. The fact is (!FACT!) Blizzard has their rules, and they are a private company that can make rules (when complying to law) and I fully support them for not wanting politics shoved  into their games by people that have no relation to Blizzard, other then playing their game.
---
Exact same level exact same feeling lol
---
Yeah I wasn't sure what to do with that last talent point. If you were going to make any tweaks to this what would you do? I know this isn't the most optimal build but so far its been fun
---
Wow thats realy unlucky, for us it took maybe 7-8 runs to get it for 2 warris and the shaman
---
id rather pay more for the convenience of always having it instead of begging mages
---
Last time I checked basic human rights and autonomy for a region isnt just a "divisive political topic" and its sickening to hear it boiled down as such. Id type out a lengthier arguement but im not 100% sure you arent some bot anyway
---
They were definitely trying to scam you. The default is always the way you described; the nodes go to whoever can harvest them, if there are multiple harvesters, then they can roll or chose to alternate picks. Also, respect for putting your name out there to stand by your belief.
---
Yeah, it's not like people are paying equal tips either - it's a generous portion of the population getting fleeced to cover/subsidize other patrons and the restaurants responsibility.
---
They've been merged since 2008. The person you're replying to was making a statement in response to this comment
---
&gt;it's time to stop blaming Activision for Blizzard's decisions.
---
Can confirm, I've used this one. 
---
"Are you just now coming to bed??"

"No, had to pee."

-Nintendo, dialogue in Pokemon.
---
Well we did it - we transferred to Arcanite Reaper and are the better for it! The server is painfully small but a tight knit community. No queue times is glorious and we are finishing off the 60 grind! If anyone is alliance on AR hit up Saga!
---
Aight Blizz, you had me for a while there but jeez, enough. So dissapointed, done with this company
---
Ore is based on level of mobs that are around.  Iron starts at 30 and Tin is completely phased out by 32-33
---
Plans are out, it's just outclassed by 1.12 items that are in the game.  Also not worth the mat cost at all. Cheaper to get a lionheart with your mats
---
Just cancelled my subscription as well.
---
Pathetic, Blizzard.
---
Missing 2x with a slow 2her is basically /r/watchpeopledie
---
A friend of mine got to 60 with 12 days played about 3 weeks after release.  12 days played in 21 days.  You can do it in much less play time of course, I'm on schedule for about 10 days played I think...but still it's a function of how much time you can carve out really.
---
They're not doing enough. People are not holding China accountable for it's actions. They ought to be sanctioned and properly categorized for their numerous human rights violations.
---
You are not getting a single dime from me anymore. Dew-nay-loh-moh Blizzard.
---
My opinion is that you're the 100th person to come on here to tell the whole world that they #StandWithHK. However it would be better if you guys posted in the megathread instead of making new topics.
---
So how many of you are going to do a single goddamn thing of substance about this, beyond preachy Reddit posts.
---
A warrior with full cooldowns, proper spec, and even gear is going to destroy a rogue. With overpower, disarm, retal, etc...Especially if the warrior has his trinket.
---
Troll piece of shit community? I read the comments and there was none of this... just logical answers. Relax dawg.
---
Yea, it's pretty crazy. Even many fashion companies. They have even gone to the point of issuing apologies to China.
---
No, its not.
---
Those elementals are designed by Satan himself.
---
Hit like a truck? Yep.
---
Immune to frost spells? Naturally.
---
Heavily fire resistant? Sure, why not.
---
You skipped all ranks of Arcane Missiles in order to save gold for mount? Of course you did. Now die.
---
Thanks for the support! Blizzard must know they have to pay the price!
---
Cancelled.
---
It's cool. America has children in cages
---
Please keep this topic to the thread that is already posted on the front page.
---
Agree with other posters to do it now instead of later if it bothers you
---
Well, time to uninstall [Battle.net](https://Battle.net). It's been a long ride since buying Warcraft 3 in a store as a kid (box is still with me after a decade and a half of moving house) but \*fuck this\*.  What I hope is clear to you all is that doing this is the cost of doing business in China, and few companies that refuse survive globally because their competitors acquiesce and get a fat revenue stream for it - this is Capitalism, one of the things that the Hong Kong protesters are fighting against as their demands grew from one to five under government repression.
---
Solidarity to the Hong Kong protesters, I hope they can survive and avoid any wrong turns.
---
Have a really nice PC and don’t really play anything other reddit. I do get some satisfaction out of the fact I could play better games though...
---
Freedom of speech is an American government thing. Most countries dont operate like yours
---
&gt; Blizzard's losses in the end will still be less than losing the entire China market
---
what blizzard losses? nobody is going to stop playing blizzard games because of this. they've already done things similar to this in the past and will continue to do so in the future
---
you are a serious dumbass. there was no rush to hit 60 because phase 2 was still a long ways off. if dire maul had had this release date from the beginning i would have leveled faster.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. But don't worry, condescension is incredibly persuasive! Far more so than actually trying to make an argument, and avoids the risk of revealing your ignorance!
---
NS HOTW. Let’s me Heal/Tank/PvP. Other Resto builds look fun too with Swiftmend but my heals have been competitive without it still
---
&gt; Doing what is right won’t always abide by the rules, especially when the rules are immoral.
---
So he wants the money but he doesn't want to follow the rules.  Sounds about right for this generation.
---
They're kind of funny. I mean, they're better than no mount, that's for sure. They're just not my favourite.
---
I don't know if this is the most profitable but I farmed earth elementals in badlands endlessly from about 37-40 and made enough. I was getting 10g/hr doing this as a priest while attempting to minimize downtime. The rocks the drop add up, some can be sent to a bank alt and be thrown on the AH for more gains. That and the greens that drop add up.
---
We ought to go on a meme campaign with the goal to make Blizzard synonymous with anything and everything anti China and anti Xi. With any luck China would separate itself from blizzard. Wishful thinking but fuck blizzard and fuck China.
---
But Warden Staff is bis for like 3-4 phases or so.
---
I'm very jealous. I'm 1 bubble away from level 59 and already started collecting some pre-bis. Getting that bow is my main goal for my hunter.
---
People need to remember classic isn't the type of game where you finish off an area 100% then move to the next. After about level 10 you will be required to travel between areas so this list won't be completely accurate.
---
Ah I missed that aspect. Did they offer an official apology to China?
---
Am I the only one confused as to why we aren’t boycotting blizzard?
---
I'm sure a tier1 csr has great insight into how the company used to be lol
---
But why not just make 10 louder?
---
Its edgy using a chinese funded tournament to get political knowing the shitstorm it would cause with the tournament hosts
---
you say that as if China gives a fuck about what you think about them lol
---
I think it’s the aq event iirc
---
10 year subscriber here. Morals &gt; money.

Blizzard isnt our Big Tegridy Goth GF anymore :(

ocasionly i tank for guild members but yeah i'll probaply level a mage very soon
---
All that matters is money. Selling out of the dream!

Cancel Blizzard

Yeah you are right. Was apparently scatterbrained when I wrote that. Have done that myself a couple times even..

Cancelled my sub, back to private servers. See ya blizz

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/df2yr0/cancel_your_subscription_to_support_hong_kong/).

Google "blizzard hearthstone "
---
This has nothing to do with me.  I unsubbed last month because I got bored and would rather play something else. I'm just pointing out that the majority of the people posting about cancelling their sub are karma whoring and will be back when this all blows over.
---
But like, how do you figure out order and stuff? Seems cool, just don't get it.
---
YouTube is a great place for alternative media. Too bad the Chinese don't have free access. 
---
It sounds like you don't know why they are protesting. Do you even know the 5 demands?
---
... it will be shit
---
Its fine.   If you take even a glance at his post history you'll see he has similar responses to other posts.  Best to just downvote and move on.
---
Dude... What? Calm down...
---
seems like the Chinese market is to big to ignore... does tencent have any blizz shares? is anybody surprised it’s all and only about money?
---
you don't have to believe it will change anything to believe it's the right thing to do.
---
I don't give my money to a lot of businesses, not because I think they will notice or care, but because I personally don't feel comfortable contributing to them.
---
This thread makes me want to sub in advance, but I'll stay monthly so Blizzard profits more in the long run.
---
It's all self validation. They quoted this gm and used the same language they used through the rest of the post. S/he is lying.
---
It the equivalent of fake fights in the shower.
---
was watching a video where the protesters called Hong Kong 'the land of the free, and the home of the brave'  
---
if that where a physical mantle that you could pass from one people to another - i'd give it to them.
---
they deserve it.  I am so proud of the people of Hong Kong.  China is not a bgi brother i would want to be set against, and they're doing it with courage, and dignity.  If i was they praying sort, I would say they have my prayers.
---
I will definitely be canceling my subscription. I have better things to do anyway.
---
Wait — so you’re not talking about the USA being pro censorship? Have you tried using a search engine that isn’t google? Perhaps looking at country variations of the same newspapers cover stories? While you’re at it, do you know who owns most of our media? 
---
The only difference between the average USA citizen and Chinese citizen is the Chinese citizen doesn’t try to lie to itself about being controlled by the government
---
Walked to Darkshore for a ghost saber.
---
You gonna make that point by actually making it or are you happy just repeating a common dismissal? Y'know, like is done in an echo chamber?
---
And wtf have you done.
---
Welcome to reddit
---
Blizzard very publicly said to the world today, we do not care about human rights or freedom.  If you can still play their games knowing that's the official stance then have fun!
---
If you're looking for a PvP focused MMO (I mean, 90%+), I'd definitely tell you to give it a shot. The original got plagued with P2W mechanics that forced a lot of players to quit. New EU publisher that hopefully is forced to uphold the "No-P2W" promise due to a few laws. I'm really excited though, the combat and gameplay felt amazing back in the day.
---
Can’t cancel. Got to keep leveling. 13 levels to go.
---
Find things to fight, continue to miss every 3rd swing.  Godspeed.
---
Made on Rattlegore and cancelled my subscription. Fuck the CCP and Fuck Blizzard.
---
6-8 hrs and your vendor/loot only totals 30gish? I'm getting 5-10 from vendor per golem run in brd and that's like an hour each at most if we're slow. This isnt selling greens, but just vendor trash. Winning a blue 2h doubles it. Selling tank services or just doing emp runs should net you plenty. Could probably just go herbalism and farm your mats and get an alchemist to craft them. Check to see if mats would be cheaper than just buying potion. 
---
All and all, it seems you are cursed by poor rolls and drop chance of grey's.
---
Value is important.  But the point he makes is the most valid. You roll before you skin, winner gets whatever you skin (be it thick leather, rugged, or w.e). If you win the roll to skin, and the hide drops, you keep the hide since you won the roll.
---
oh shit what statement did someone make that palm oil tried to erase from the internet?
---
What if the point of the original game design isn’t for every class to do top dps? Or even be viable in MC. 
---
What if the point is to pick a race/class/spec you identify with, something you feel excited to play and progress with, and then at 60 you find yourself among 39 others who did the same thing. And now you have to figure out a way to use all your strengths cohesively to kill a boss. 
---
More knowledge isn’t the only reason players are completing end game content in classic much quicker than in vanilla. More people were playing the game to have fun then, as opposed to just beating the game as quickly as possible. My guild in vanilla took months to finish MC, as we were a full 40 person squad that was a clusterfuck of races/classes/specs. Killing rag was extremely difficult but extremely rewarding. There was a celebration in guild chat, teamspeak, and even Ironforge general chat. 
---
Sure, back in vanilla there were still many guilds dedicated to speed and efficiency, but that wasn’t the primary goal of most of the player base which is how it feels now. 
---
I’m still having a great time playing classic wow, but feel like I needed to say this.
---
I'm... not frustrated? Are you being provocative?
---
Yea. I started on Kromcrush because I'm originally from spirestone. My friends however wanted to play on Biggles. So I leveled a warrior on both.
---
I thought you meant the server. And yes it is
---
Blizzard's stance on this won't make one bit of difference to the Chinese government, but Blizzard absolutely does stand to lose everything in China.  You could argue that they shouldn't be doing business in China if that's the case, but the fact is that money comes back and supports their American workers.
---
So, choosing between my American workers and Chinese politics, I'd choose my workers every time.  Blizzard did nothing wrong.  This is just the emotional, knee-jerk, outrage culture at it again.
---
guess im quitting wow...
---
Lockpicking is not equal to mage water and portals, you don’t just go to class trainer and click 2 buttons for couple gold to improve your skill, it’s more like a rogue profession and you spend hours lvling it. 
---
I’m fine with your solution tho, 1 min before forced teleportation in more than enough (especially with sprint) to go back to chest and loot it :)
---
Dude. This guy was defending you. Holy shit
---
Stupid ban anyways. I guess I will stand up for Paris and then the banned by Microsoft, but that wouldn’t make any sense would it? I’m glad I don’t play World of Warcraft
---
Although it would be pretty funny to see an army of level 1s chasing around a contender for R14 so he accidentally kills a bunch and loses honor every time he uses some aoe ability.
---
Ive heard from other people (sarah silverman I believe talked about it) that comedy central gives its creators near total freedom. The only time Ive ever heard of them censoring something was when they wouldnt let Southpark show muhammad.
---
I quit after 40. No regrets
---
I thought 30-40 was much worse than 40-50. At lvl 40 there are plenty of plentiful questing zones (lower stv, tanaris, feralas, hinterlands) and arguably the best farmable instance in the game (zf).
---
you can even abbreviate it by just typing "/tar XXXX" if you don't feel like setting up a macro, and you only need to type a portion of the name. for example, in SM GY to search for the rare bosses I would type "/tar azsh" or "/tar iron". So long as the letters you type are unique to the mob it'll work.
---
Once I'm mostly geared with as close to BiS as I'm going to get I'll probably just pop on for some battlegrounds for a bit daily. 
---
Haven't leveled any alts yet so maybe I'll catch that bug.
---
Sure people would if they are taking him being banned for violating the contract as blizzard being pro china you would assume people would go look at this blizzard being pro hong kong if they didnt.
---
You are an idiot
---
Feed the damn cat
---
I care about you now.
---
Are there any good guides out there?  Just need a refresher on Tribute runs and all of that
---
I left log ago for retail being crap but now I have uninstalled everything and blasted them on twitter. More minecraft time for me now!
---
I don't keep up with current events, so I'm just here enjoying my time playing Classic.
---
Ignorance is bliss.
---
Silithus has some good quests
---
It's because they are actually mostly China owned companies.
---
am i missing something? he says he’s 10 levels higher than the person camping him
---
I feel like the quotation marks are meant to mock him, but you know he'd be all for it if given the opportunity.
---
Looks like it's time to cancel my subscription.
---
TBC classic with proper patch progression is my dream.  you only have 3 major patches (could include voice chat patch changes in with another one) which are already well documented on wowpedia.  pre nerf t5 would be actual progression for the normal guild in 2019 compared to MC which would still be a joke had we launched with 1.0 vanilla game state
---
That's the third line of "A Narcissist's Prayer", no?
---
What is this, the NBA?
---
No. If you cancel your WoW subscription and post a screenshot to Reddit you are a hero and will be mentioned in history books someday. Stop spreading lies just because you're jealous you don't have a [moral barometer](https://imgur.com/r/hittableFaces/6MAmcGc)
---
You are correct. It was a business decision, with real world consequences. 
---
When you chose a side in a situation like this your going to get hurt big time. It isn't being blown out of proportion, it's being treated as it should be. A very serious issue. 
---
Just because it was "business" doesn't change the facts of the situation. They still 100% deserve every piece of backlash they get.
---
The threat and Defense talents are huge for tanking. Changing to prot made a noticeable difference on maintaining threat. 
---
I'd go a Hybrid build for now. If you decide at end-game you want to continue tanking, then you'll need to go Prot, but at 46 it's entirely too early to switch. I went Prot at level 49 and that was about 6 levels too early, so I would not recommend repeating my mistakes.
---
*That's* why I always hearth on top of the counter in Auberdine?? I see.
---
This is maybe the most interesting rivarly betwen two superpowers in a long time.No matter how much west pushes for a narrative that honk kong protesters aren't bunch of anti-mainlander rascists financed by USA government China can just order bunch of western  companies  to shut up which for example Soviet Union couldn't do.American capitalism turning against it's own government in the matters of foreign policy.
---
5%
---
It simply feels a lot better to me since you can freely choose which stance whenever, instead of having a range of stance+spell macros. It makes stance dancing much better since you are not bound to casting a spell to change back. (For instance: going from defensive to berserker to throw in a quick whirlwind while tanking and back) I don’t really have a rationalization for this, just try it I suppose.
---
Do you have an argument why the alternative may be better?
---
This right here, everyone spends hours grinding gold to get the mount at 40 when they could spend that time continuing to quest and have the mount by like 42...its 2 more levels...people really can wait lol
---
Have you ever played a warlock before? We have relatively small mana pools, cast (some) inefficient spells, have no passive mana regen, and are constantly spamming abilities so mp5 is not a thing. Luckily we have things like life tap, drain life, and the classic bandage to make up for that. That's how warlocks regenerate mana. Life tap. Read it again, life tap. One final time, life tap. Losing 100 mana on a mount cast means literally nothing. At 60 100 mana isn't even 1/3 the cost of most warlock spells, so no, it won't make a difference. 
---
Should you at some point choose to play a warlock, and you decide to use a standard non-class mount, that's fine. You do you. Otherwise, keep your retail min/max mentality to yourself.
---
As a healer here are my major issues.   There are two ways to run a medium difficulty dungeon. You can either let tank get aggro, single target dps and keep moving mob to mob with limited drinking or downtime. Or, if you have aoe, pull 3 mobs and aoe them down and then drink. What I find is that most groups I run with are pulling a single mob, aoe them down, then spend 30 seconds drinking because they drained their mana for no reason.
---
The rest of us have been waiting for Wpvp so no thanks
---
I gotta agree with you. Blizzard and any other company out there are not created for political gains. They clearly have policies in place to avoid getting involved in controversial events that would separate their player base. They're supposed to be focused on the gaming experience, not someone's policital agenda.
---
I'm glad so many people support HK but this outrage towards Blizzard, which is understandably trying to stay away from controversial issues, is a little over the top. Blizzard has no obligation to choose sides, and honestly, they should stay out of it.
---
Simplest change would be to drop it into Imp Revenge. You could also put it into Imp HS, maybe along with your Imp Charge point and/or your Piercing Howl point.
---
So long as they can keep players invested thwn they will continue to make money through subs. Yes BC classic would be a smash hit but they would risk loosing many of the classic purists as well as the more cassual players who dont want to see their progress invalidated by a raised level cap. Mind you these are just my speculations and infact i might just be wrong about the entire thing.
---
Palm oil is often collected using slave labor and child labor in south-asian countries.
---
Or do you only care about someone getting banned on the internet?
---
All of these people, everyone, "I stand for human rights!" but don't give a fuck about *actual* slavery for hundreds and thousands of food products.
---
Same. Back to FF14 I go
---
Just run zf over and over. Or go to feralas/hinterlands
---
I always try to do this then the ally player starts attacking... So I have to put my new found friend down :(
---
There are. I am using them and its just so nice for healing.
---
Hahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahah
---
Just cancelled my subscription. 
---
I was so hyped for Classic. I've been playing it as much as I can, what with working 2 jobs during the summer and now being back in school. My warrior barely hit lvl 38.
---
However, who can, in good conscience, play this game after seeing all the photos and footage coming out of HK and knowing now where Blizzard stands?
---
I'm out.
---
Wait, you can correct my if I'm wrong but I'm fairly certain that rage doesn't increase your crit chance in classic.
---
I distinctly remember being able to tab target to things that were out of LOS, which was pretty huge in battlegrounds like AV where you could shoot through mountains. Doesn't seem like you can do that anymore with this game engine...
---
I want to get world first BWL(and rest of raid), and help my raid achieve the best speed runs in classic.
---
I suppose it's too much to ask that *no* boot heel be placed upon HK.
---
I'm sorry, I just don't think a Pooh bear is really the best form of leadership for a nation as large as China.
---
*cries in paladin*
---
I was on discord with my buddy one day and just chatting and literally stop mid sentence and just go “I’m dead” as soon as I saw the mark
---
Can I have an explanation of what you're talking about? I think I missed something.
---
Lockpicking doesnt take up 1 of your 2 valuable profession slots, unlike skinning
---
That's literally what this guy is arguing
---
&gt; that's actually a violation of human rights, and I can't stand with a company who does that.
---
fish in tanaris, sell stonescale eel
---
I had to grind SM Library for the staff, and then SM Cathedral a few more times for Whitemane's Chapeau and the neck piece.  ~3-4 levels between 30-40 was from the XPs of grinding. I also did a few Cathedral grinds after hitting 40 because I needed to sell the gear drops after going broke due to purchasing my mount. I do agree it's mind-numbing even though my group was super fast with 3 mages. I responded to a guildie asking for SM runs and after doing the same instance 5 times I forgot he was in my guild. I'm finally at a point where I can join Ulda/ZF runs without having half of my spells resisted so I'm probably not going to come back to SM again.
---
Blizzard-Activision and they have run to the ground all their games with their greed.
---
Haha yeah, this will be an interesting year.
---
My hands are going to be full with the 46 on retail and the 16 on classic.. At least classic has an end, I fear I'm gonna end up at 50 on retail real soon :X
---
Have a good one Bob! Glad to see you enjoy it :D
---
There is no wrong medium for this type of message. It's not so much about being upset that Blizzard banned him it's about the fact that B-A clearly puts its own profit above basic morality and human rights. I don't particularly feel like supporting a company like that and I'm going to make as much noise as possible to draw attention to the fact. People sympathizing with Blizzard on the technicality that 'it's in the rules' can go jump. That's like saying the murder of homosexuals in countries like Iran or Yemen is okay because it's in 'the rules'.
---
Fuck no. You want to skip WPVP? Why? That makes no sense. We are about to have something far better than battlegrounds
---
We shall be watching your career with great interest.
---
Lol, yeah you're a real hero.  Hypocrite.

Would the phrase "Chai not bad" pass any censors?
---
I mean while what Blizzard is doing is outrageous (especially the stealing the prize money wtf) it's not an uncommon standpoint from a business. ofc. Corporations will side with China especially Blizzard who have spent more than a decade expanding their brand in China. If something like this incident would happen to any other company than Blizzard they too would most likely side with China as well, so getting mad just because this one incident happened with Blizzard is just silly.
---
If people truly gave a shit they would start electing people in their own country, who could challenge the Chinese government and their shitty practices against humanity. And not just sit behind their keyboard thinking they are activists for chanting “FREE HK” and believing they are changing the world by unsubbing to a online video game…
---
Cancelled my sub as well.
---
look up the 'vuhdo' UI for healer.
---
color coded, built-in mouseover macro, debuff tracking, highlight people being rezzed...
---
I literally grew up with this company. Blizzard has been a huge part of my life for a very long time. This makes me sad. 
---
Goodbye Blizzard, 
---
If anything the outcry is going to do more for public shaming than any amount of cancelations.
---
China is nazi germany 2.0, i think they should choose sides
---
They'll push content for the streamers until it falls below a threshold and abandon it.
---
Ok, so you’ll be playing this whole month, forget about the issue by then, and resub.
---
Things like TBC classic seem more likely as they are pretty much guaranteed income for minimal effort.
---
Classic+ would be awesome as they could retry expansion while taking into account last mistakes. The only problem is that they have to develop completely new content. Or smash together old content. Kind of hard to use TBC content without flying. I forget the zone name but you had to fly around on a bunch of floating islands at one point.
---
I personally wouldn't mind if they reused old content while developing fresh Classic+ expansions

Yikes.

The ping difference between "east coast" servers and west is all of 12-18ms. Not even noticeable. All of the east servers are actually housed in central anyway. There are no actual east coast servers afaik.

Whenever I need a lockbox open, I just stand in front of the bank/mailbox area and /y LF rogue to open $box, 20s. Immediately invited to a group or whispered every time
---
&gt;Terrible advice, i hate that mark , absolutely enrages me. i kill 100% everyone that dares throw one on me.
---
Horde. Thunderfury. Returning player looking for a casual/LGBTQ+ friendly guild with goals of raiding longer term. Level 31 rogue enjoying leveling, professions, and excited to reach end game content for the first time. I usually play 3-4 nights a week, but occasionally adult life gets in the way. A guild with some experienced members who don’t mind guiding people through late/end game would be ideal!
---
In game: Chachki
---
Probably don’t want to be on south parks bad side
---
This is gonna not be great for blizzard.
---
Like anything, it warns corporations to not be puppets to China. China only does this if they think they can get away with it without consequence.
---
I unsubscribed with the explanation of them banning a player. I'm in shock over Blizzard f'ing up once again. RIP Blizzard of old. It was good knowing you. I will remember you.
---
THat's horrible for a warrior when you can just use whirlwind axe which will have better top end dmg.
---
Watch out, you might offend him for not rooting for China
---
I think they felt the profit margins in China's market would outweight any of the negative publicity.
---
Copy paste or just type in in say for stitches 
---
/target stitches
---
Save the macro. Now any time you ruin that macro it will try to target stitches.
---
How many times are you going to post this?
---
haha
---
Imp has the highest dps... until it runs out of mana.  Succubus has the best white damage, felpup has more useful skills, but generally in a dungeon you keep the imp out phased for blood pact on your party.
---
doesn't work in classic
---
Unfortunately they nuked Linux users with the blacklisting they did during this past round of DDOS attacks. I think you can get around it by changing your user agent, but as a Linux user, you’re in unofficial support territory, so there’s no telling what tomorrow holds.
---
Just can't wait for Chinas rule over American politics can ya? Why don't ya just move to China and speed up your enslavement you spineless blob.
---
I was in azshara about to hearth to IF. They were all there though.
---
Jesus how many time you gonna post this.
---
Here is blizzards customer service phone number.
---
800-592-5499
---
Let them know how you feel!
---
Nope. Last I checked China is only 12% of their revenue
---
Agreeed
---
Once you get past lvl 20-30 or so, it's imp all day for the stam buff.
---
Just cancled my sub. So disappointed.
---
Baby steps take time. We can still enjoy technology from China but it's important that we curve how the country develops. Our behaviors as consumers to China dictates a lot of how they will be shaped over time. It's not an easy task but I'm up for the challenge.
---
as said. the damage comes from AoE. Single target is weaker than fury
---
FFS the race to 60 is over and the honor patch isn't even out. This is literally easy season for cancelling subs to punish Blizzard so if taking a break isn't worth standing up for your values then you should reconsider how much you really care about your values as well as how strong of an effect this game has over your own life.
---
only 20-30 gold after 6-8 hours? I feel like something's off here.
---
You should be able to get ~10-15 gold per hour just by killing random mobs in eastern plague lands and selling the vendor trash.

How did you post this 5 times...

Where did this idea that boycots are meaningless come from?
---
Is it all the failed boycots which only got a couple hundred participants?
---
You do understand that a boycot that people actually take part in will still have an effect... right?
---
Google has the pronunciation of douche as ‘doo-sh’ and sew as ‘doo’.
---
Just add the ‘sh’ to the end of ‘dew’ and they’re pronounced identically.
---
And businesses can be held accountable and often pay the price by chasing only the dollar. Contribute to that by cancelling your sub.

---
Same one as me I guess
---
When you are level 52 you can start doing Arena runs to farm for a really good ring.
---
Fair enough.  In my experience there's always some small, central core people disagree on, and I think we found ours.
---
Ok so by your own admission you prefer rogues because they don't compete with you for gear, meaning there is a motive that isn't "SOLELY LOCKPICKING SKILL" as I clearly stated.
---
I would get rid of my retail toons in a heartbeat. I don’t plan on going back.
---
Or dragging onto the character themselves in game...
---
&gt;what about farming your entire first tier of gear? LBRS, UBRS, Strat, Scholo, Attunements
---
Can be done in a few runs of each dungeon as long as you form your own groups to spread out loot competition
---
&gt;and finally farming Fire Resist gear for Rag
---
completely unnecessary
---

---
Disney has been complicit for years in this shit, and actively works with censors on stuff.
---
pulling stuff normally doesn't mean hours either? what are you saying?
---
You on Kromcrush?
---
Luckily reddit doesnt get a dime of my money and I rotate between a dozen accounts so they dont get any of my data either.  Now blizzard doesnt get any of that as well.
---
Good thing we don't have to play with them for the next couple weeks until they come back
---
The world feels bigger when there is unbeaten content out there. Guilds will always run everything. You won't be left behind unless you are literally years late.
---
A rival company that makes Gods Unchained is giving him his prize money back and entering him into their own tournament.
---
&gt; all other instances dont immediately become obsolete and DM gets farmed to the exclusion of all other instances.
---
I agree with that, but wanted to clarify that a good number of current bis or prebis items still become obsolete with DM. The dungeons don't become completely obsolete, but some items are going to be, which makes running those dungeons less desirable. And this is especially the case for healers, who have a significant amount of BIS in DM. It's going to become more difficult to find a healer for stuff like BRD, LBRS, Strat Live, etc.
---
&gt;so this idea that all bis gear that you farmed up being pointless is just asinine.
---
I don't think anyone is saying this. A lot of people are probably relieved that they don't have to, for example, run Strat Live about a hundred times for a 1% drop chance BIS cloak.
---
if you're talking about rosewine, it is not dropped by the event boss. its dropped by the voone. its actually an extremely easy ring to farm.
---
cancelt today aswell and statet this event with a link to famous german news site  [https://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/hongkong-blizzard-sperrt-e-sport-profi-wegen-solidaritaets-aktion-a-1290542.html](https://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/hongkong-blizzard-sperrt-e-sport-profi-wegen-solidaritaets-aktion-a-1290542.html)
---
Patch1.12
---
this always makes me chuckle
---
First, wow has no official league, they aren't going to ban normal players for protected speech. This isn't some random HS player, he's a member of Blizzard's league, and they make the rules. He's acting in an official capacity for Blizzard. 
---
Netflix, Disney, UFC, NBA, etc. will not take a human rights stand if it means alienating the biggest emerging market on the planet. Realistically speaking, there is nothing you could possibly do to have an influence on China's behavior in this situation outside of starting world war 3.
---
I’ll be asking for my money back. 
---
I never would have purchased my subscription had I known their business practice of appeasing communists. 
---
It’s fraud to me, and I will demand my money back.
---
Strat is super rare because there is almost no tanking equipment.
---
Grow up child
---
Whoa boy I can’t wait to read their first public apology and watch the backtracking begin. They could lose tens of millions from this and hopefully more. I’m so so angry and sad. This game (classic) came out at a time I really needed to escape my life. I don’t know what I’m going to do now. Fuck you Blizzard. Just pathetic. Grow some balls
---
Reddit gets your money by you being on reddit
---
Log off for 10 min and take a break
---
Turn your sub off, leave your chars in case Blizz does something differently, and go back to private servers.  BOOM, you still get to play.
---
What cowardice. Completely ignoring horrid violations of human rights, because you might lose some stock support
---
Oh man, look at this cognitive dissonance.
---
Just own up to the fact that you are going to keep willfully supporting China by buying Chinese-manufactured goods because _most_ of the "recreational" items you own have roots in China and you're just not enough of an altruist to give them up.
---
&gt; The only thing that that I can't parse at the moment is whether or not you're simply a concern troll or some awful misanthropic asshole.
---
I'm just honest with myself.  I'm not going to give up playing Classic and I'm not going to stop buying shit made in China.  Why?  Because I care about me more than I care about them.
---
Make no mistake, that's you too-- you're just too much of a punk to admit it.  'Nuff said.  Muted.
---
1.4 &lt; 1.12
---
Now try that as alliance when every fear is immediately followed by wotf :D
---
People think cancelling their sub is going to change anything haha, what a bunch of idiots. Most of us are still going to play, you think a few people cancelling their subs are going to make a difference? Youre better off making a facebook post asking for 1 like=1 prayer for Hong Kong
---
Precisely how I feel.
---
Disgusting. Blizzard PR has been atrocious for the last couple of years treating players as numbers, and now we can see they view Hong Kong fighting for its rights just the same; numbers on a paper, and not real people.
---
Canceled as well I cannot support a company that stands by this violence.
---
More of this please :)
---
I'm plenty grown, thanks.
---
I thought Undead rogues were the bane of my existence until a Troll rogue camped me and interrupted attempts on an Elite for LITERALLY 45 MIN STRAIGHT.  
---
I wrote his name down in my special list..
---
Ctrl+tab tagets friendly units
---
Dont hurt yourself with all of those red herrings
---
Nice defensiveness
---
Seems unlikely but if that is the plan it would be sad.
---
Well I guess my subscription is being canceled. It’s a fun game but I can’t ethically support this company.
---
Not everyone is amoral like you
---
It's okay keep thinknig that though, whatever helps you
---
"lol i am SO smart look at me"
---
Yep. No hard feelings though, have a nice evening!
---
With ZG and AQ20, you had a raid that provided catch up gear mid-way through vanilla. It still required a moderately challenging (especially at the time) raid to get the gear.
---
Zul'aman was the patch that introduced not just a raid for catch up, but the new badge gear that made earlier raids kind of pointless. It was possible to skip t4 and t5 and jump right into t6 (with the exception of the the attunments) by just doing 5 man heroics, which were more on par with t4, if not far easier in some dungeons
---
It radically changed the philosophy of raiding, gear progression, and  difficulty throughout an expansion, and that patches system was rolled into all future releases.
---
*Note: This is an opinion about a game system.*
---
&gt; Blizzard's livelihood is pretty dependent in not pissing off the Chinese government. D'you know how many more jobs they'd have to cut if they weren't allowed to sell their games there any more whatsoever? I'd wager quite a few.
---
The whole above mate.  Do you not understand words? 
---
If they do X Y would happen. 
---
1. If they did this their livelihood would be lost.
---
2. If they did this jobs would have to be cut.
---
Since you are clearly attempting to justify their action with this explanation they must *not* have done X in order to ensure Y.
---
Well I'm glad you found a way to do nothing and still feel morally superior.
---
I've killed hunters for doing that to me when I initially had no intention of engaging in PvP.  Albeit, I do run away first until the mark goes away.
---
They are but at the same time Retail is losing active players in favor for classic.
---
i went on vacation for 3 weeks like a day after launch lol
---
Except they're put at a disadvantage because anyone can clear Dire Maul. Any time spent farming on gear that has upgrades in DM (and there is alot of good gear there) is jist about completly wasted by the update.
---
If it took you longer to level, you can just jump in to DM and get the same gear (kind of like a catch up mechanic)
---
*Smite mode activated*
---
Sulfuras horde?
---
Whisper Cataphract in game.  I would like to know who this guy is so I can get more info.
---
There was expectations that if we gave into them theyd return the favor and wed hopefully get the compromise we wanted.
---
Seriously we expected the bad people would turn good out of the goodness of their hearts
---
Firstly! I didn't know this when starting with mouse over macros. You can't bind mouse buttons with mouse over macros. Mouse clicks override the mouseover functionality. Mouse over macros need to be bound to keyboard.
---
I'm not familiar with priest spells but this is a macro I have for my paladin
---
    
---
    /cast [ nomod,@mouseover,help,nodead] Flash of Light
---
    /cast [ mod:shift,@mouseover,help,nodead] Cleanse
---
This allows me to use flash of light and cleans on the same macro by either just hitting the button or hitting shift.
---
well he kind of has a point.  if there is a cookie cutter spec that is proven to output the best dps, and you choose to ignore it means you're not pulling your weight.  you could be doing better but you choose to play mediocre.  if you're not taking the game as seriously as your guild, maybe you made a poor choice in joining that guild.  find a mediocre guild to be in.
---
Yeah man movies get localized. Obviously China goes hard on it we all know that. I'm not really sure what you're getting at? Blizz taking away prize money and banning the hearthstone champ for a year for supporting Hong Kong isn't the same as tailoring a movie to China.
---
HEY /r/leagueoflegends, THIS is how you manage a fucking subreddit. Thanks for not being a fucking shill
---
I canceled my sub too, greets from Finland🇫🇮
---
yep, just use rank 1 wing clip and abuse pathing around the gong. jump down platforms and keep serpent going while kiting him, that's what i did
---
When can we expect you to turn in your Chinese slave-labor-made goods, you fucking _hero_ of morality?
---
Whataboutism at its best people.
---
Taurens just look so cool. I don't regret going orc but I just know my gear would look better on a tauren
---
Only true downside I've heard is having to unmount to get through the elevator doors in UC
---
Xi Meiping?
---
Yeah, I agree with you man lol relax. As I pointed out in a different reply, OP literally shut up and left. He went to bury his head in the sand like you said. Some people just don't care and aren't going to, that's their prerogative.
---
I'm actually shocked they're releasing dire maul so fast. Most of my friends with jobs and families are in the 40s, not even close to 60.
---
Pepridge farm remembers when Blizzard was a rad company
---
Alright, you win. You've called me a child the number of times it takes for me to submit.
---
Stop giving them your money you dummies
---
You should go ahead and lookup strawman, lmao xD
---
This thread was about people thinking their tweets / comments / discussion on Reddit is actually helpful in enacting social and political change - you know, the goal of activism. Digital slacktivism is just this: lazily commenting and talking online in an attempt to activate meaningful social or political change.
---
I’m not a digital slacktivist because I’m not trying to achieve any change- political or social - via my online efforts. I’m acknowledging how ineffective they are. 
---
Nice try though =)
---
Firt of all, rude. Secondly, I only play one or two hours a day, only if my friend are conected.
---
&gt; They're not worth the same. Warden staff is invaluable to a druid, it makes the class. It's 400 plus g to anyone else.
---
They can sell it for mount money and buy another one later for 400g. It's worth EXACTLY the same. Hell, the druid might want to sell it for 430g and buy one back later for 400g. or 350g. Your demand to require people to treat BoEs as BoPs has no foundation in logic. It just opens people up to ninjas and collusion.
---
I'm a bear tank too, and if a warden staff drops i'm instructing everyone to need roll. They can use it just as much as I can. It's worth the same to everyone. If they have a principle that I should have it, they can gift it if they want. It's a BoE. But I'm certainly not demanding it from them. I'll ask to buy at a lower price, they might agree. Win-win for everyone
---
No, they wouldn't have.
---
hmmmmmmm fair point..
---
ThreatPlates, Luna for frames.
---
Working for any company, much less a company with a global audience, comes with requirements as to what you can and can't say in the public space as an employee. A company holding it's employees to a standard of conduct is not the same as suppressing freedom.
---
Ya, how dare us hate authoritarian regimes.
---
Thanks. I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. I understand how the ability works but don't know which encounters deal no spell damage. Or are you just dragging me for having the gall to ask questions about being a mage?
---
Fuck how did this happen.  Eh no time to worry about that now, time to farm up some soul shards for MC run later.
---
I have done very little besides playing WoW for the last month. I have a lvl 51 warrior and a 44 druid. I guess I should have went down to 3 hours of sleep or only play 1 char to keep up with Blizzard...
---
I'm 100% with you man!
---
Fucking sellouts
---
This is actually false. They only make up 12%
---
It breaks my heart to see a diablo 2 player slip into the void, but you have the support of a disgruntled asshole. Rock on homie.
---
I don't care about the rules in this situation. I care about the ethics. You are obviously the other way around. And that's fine.
---
Casuals don't give a shit what content is released when.
---
For sure, if you play a lot then you eventually run out of incentive to log in daily. The plus side of course is it's free to play, so you can just log in for new story chapters and come back when new raid wings are released and such if you really want!
---
That said, for me it's all about World Bosses and WvW. Find a good community in the game, make whatever legendaries you want, raid until you get bored of it, and then WvW is what keeps me going until the next refresh.
---
True but even parents who know what the game is can still have trouble handling the problem. For example I was extremely addicted to Wow at 15 and fought constantly with my parents. They did everything they could to get me off (taking away internet and pc’s) but I always found a way because at the end of the day I wanted to spend inordinate amounts of time on it.
---
Honestly I don't give a flying fuck and will continue playing.
---
i just wrote 'CHINA IS BAD PEOPLE AND SO ARE YOU'
---
Literally happened to me last night.
---
I join a grp for UBRS, where the Jed trinket is on reserve but everything else is open rolls.
---
Then suddenly right before Rend comes out ML gets put back on. I ask in raid if something else was on res. No response until after we are in combat.
---
I tell the healer, in whispers, I’m not comfortable using ML in a group that is supposed to be open as that’s not what I thought I was joining and I don’t want to take the time to clear to drak to have the ring ML’d to their guildies. I wish him good luck and grats on the Jed trinket.
---
So I drop group.
---
Then get a nasty tell from their tank threatening me with black list for... not taking loot?
---
Anyway, the coward puts me on ignore before I can respond.
---
I pull him up on twitch, and guess what... the idiot loots a plate belt to himself when another warrior won the roll.
---
I’m not debating the easiest. I’m saying that skinning is not locked to a class. Anyone can get it. But only rogues can pick
---
No it is very casual friendly... because leveling is a very casual experience.  It’s just not BFA epic welfare
---
So glad I sold my blizz options after the spike on classics release.
---
There's also an investigation on execs breaking fiduciary duty.  Lots of stinky things happening at ATVI, was a good short term play for the big dip they had, but iffy longterm(mostly reliant on mobile) unless changes happen.
---
Oh no, sacrificing a computer game.
---
Hot air and throwing away toys is not substantial.
---
Blizzard don’t care about Hong Kong, they didn’t do this out of support for either side. They did to keep the Chinese market, it just so happens that involves siding with China.
---
Of course that doesn’t make it any better at all but it sheds some light on why they were so blunt about it. Even without the political repercussions it doesn’t bode well that would accept any Western backlash in favor of the Eastern audience.
---
I only really played smash bros and zelda before this, but not a ton. I'd recommend taking it slow, and not over explaining things to her. Show her how to do something once or twice, and then wait for her to ask if she forgot. Let her explore as much as she'd like (but maybe warn her if she's headed somewhere too dangerous). Exploring is a lot of the appeal of the game to me, at least.
---
The run will go slower if you die because you keep putting yourself at 10% hp not to mention if i have to drink less. There's a balance where the lock can life tap on a reasonable extent without being a burden and still have a great damage output. Playing with a dps minus cause you died like a retard isn't helping anyone. 
---
You are cancer with your self-entitled attitude of "lol i'll just go all out cause fuck it, that sucker can always just heal me even though i'm not even the tank". Keep doing your thing though, don't let me stop you.
---
Canceled mine today.
---
&gt;If people truly gave a shit they would start electing people in their own country, who could challenge the Chinese government and their shitty practices against humanity.
---
I don't think you can say his name on this fascist reddit, but you mean like the current US president who has engaged a trade war on China?
---
Wait theres a new season? Thanks!
---
&gt;Nobody wants to feel behind
---
Then they need to stop treating it like a race. I play casually and I don't have the mentality that I'm being left behind. I enjoy the game at my pace.
---
If they want to race then they shouldn't play casually. If all they can do is play casually, then they should just enjoy the ride and don't compete in a race they can't win.
---
I agree with you about the validity of the skinners claim. I don’t know how I feel yet I’m just throwing out ideas. Other professions require a significant investment that skinning doesn’t. I’m not sure if that’s material or not. What does feel material to me is two things: you can’t skin it unless you kill it and you can’t get the drop unless you have the dagger and the ability. I get your view that only the second part matters, and you may be right, but I haven’t come to a conclusion yet myself. The first part feels important too.
---
I buy my clothes almost exclusively from thrift shops, so I'm not really bothered by that.
---
I don't use Nestlé products, to the best of my knowledge.
---
yes, I have a Android, but a phone has a little more impact on my life as a whole than whether or not I get to play Overwatch or drink Rogue beer.
---
I don't have the time or resources to investigate every company, but if something comes to my attention that I don't like and can easily avoid, I do.
---
it's not an all or nothing game, man. you can protest through legislation and other actions while also voting with your wallet. 
---
anyway, it's not really the point, but you know there are thousands upon thousands of examples of companies changing their direction because of financial protests?
---
Dammit, I just started Warbiking in July.
---
I was surprised by the return of Classic (I hate, hate, *hate* what they did to my warlock) and thrilled to return to that game.
---
Now I have to go find a private server so I can cancel??? How do I even do that???
---
This after earning my BiS weapon last night. :-(
---
You're right. I just think its important to have context. It's an upsetting situation. We all wish that the companies that we enjoy would align morally with us, but corporations are amoral by design generally and very few will choose to make a political stand, especially when part of their market would be alienated.   
---
TL;DR the world can be a real shitty place.
---
You inspired me! I'm cancelling my sub too. Fuck this, it's just a game. They messed up stuff that is much more important, and we can talk with our wallets. It's the least I can do to support the cause, from so far away.
---
Run dungeons! Great way to switch up the monotony of questing and get some drops/exp while you're at it
---
So you're saying that you're going to stop buying Chinese-made goods going forward?
---
What? I think you read it wrong. Try again.
---
DO IT!
---
Post it in a bunch of highly visible places and make it clear in the title that this is a resistance thing
---
I upvoted because of the topic but how is this even remotely applicable to WoW is really beyond my comprehension. Clickbait title.
---
Cancelled my sub aswell, this is bigger than the game
---
40-43ish is rough if you have been questing. Most quests in STV are 42-44, Tanaris is 44, Feralas 42-44, Hinterlands 44. So you are running around picking scraps of levels from anywhere you haven't at that point.
---
I used my phone to sell my Activation Blizzard stock today. Fuck them.
---
Wait, Warlocks don't have their level 60 mount right now?
---
No, no. “Muh reality” — be mad at china, sure, but fuck it would be tight for a lil bit of that rage to land stateside
---
I just made this because I couldn't find anything else. The starting date is based on my current lockout timer (resets this saturday AM). Since its supposed to be a static 5 day reset timer, this should sync with everyone.

Once I hit 55, I started running BRD pretty steady.  It's a great way to get experience while you also grind for gear you need.  Depending on how the BRD groups go / how much dungeon running you can handle, you will still need to supplement this with questing because you'll likely be too low for Scholo/BRS/Strat groups until ~58.  (Yes you can run these earlier than 58 but unless you're in a guild group it'll be tough to find one).  If you dont need anything out of BRD, I'd reccomend just rushing to 60 and finding a group for the dungeons you need then.  It's a lot easier once you're capped, even if your gear is bad people are still more likely to take a 60 than a random 57-58.
---
/tar works too
---
I was so surprised when I turned that quest in 😂
---
For those not aware of stuff that goes on at Blizzard, Mark Kern was the lead producer on wow vanilla and over the years he has shared a lot of insight into the company. 
---
Blizzard was a team of dudes set out to make a lot of money. They found the niche of making games for gamers. But as soon as they got big enough to sell out, they did. The whole "trustworthy" appearance was just good business to them. 
---
The moment WoW got big, the leads at blizzard fired a ton of people, said "we are a real company now" and all sold out and soon retired. Some poke around still, and a few show some interest in the products still, but most are long gone and sailed off into the sunset w/ a bucket of money. 
---
Most American conglomerates are actually Chinese owned. Blizzard makes 80% of its money (or more) from China. China injects SJW culture into the companies to further weaken America's place on the world stage. Blizzard is a corporate shill for the Chinese authoritarian government. The one thing you can never do is criticize the authoritarian chinese government. The "SJW" views at blizzard is all virtue signalling. They are intolerant, hateful, and out to serve an agenda. Actual human rights is NOT one of the agendas.
---
I am personally doing what I can to support the Chinese people by buying as much gold as I can afford.
---
Probably not yet. It's still in beta so there's lots of bugs still and optimization is needed. That said they have lots of innovative ideas, such as their "Paid to play" raffle token economy and just the whole ownable digital assets concept.
---
I wish more people would say, fuck blizzard.
---
will do! (thumbs up)
---
As much as I love Classic, I’m not going to fund a company that defends human rights violations.
---
Cya when you figure out how the real world works.
---
Yes you will hit 60 with quests to spare
---
When can I expect you to suck my Johnson?
---
Some Esports dudes got banned by Blizz for supporting hong kong
---
You either unsub and take a moral stand that changes nothing, or you don't and it still doesn't change anything. If it makes you feel better then go for it, but don't live in the illusion that your protest will affect anyone but yourself. Which is absolutely fine, of course.
---
Hi it's Jerry
---
Because that was violation of TOS?
---
The point is to make them start drink/eating. Once they start doing that, you leave them be.
---
I picked Orc Warrior. Kinda wish I picked something that has a better matchup vs frost mage before phase 3. 
---
Every. Other. Red. I run by is a god-forsaken gnome mage that thinks they’re hot shit because they can cold snap frost novas.
---
Ignoring playing time constraints, you're really hurting yourselves having that many alts so early on. Pick a toon and stick to it, or you'll never make progress. Alts are what you do when you've run out of endgame content.
---
Ice? We literally had concentration camps last year my dude.
---
Right now with gear being what it is and how much damage most people are putting out in raids, for a lot of people, deep prot will be the better tanking spec as it offers shield slam. A shield slam crit is like 4k threat. 
---
That being said you're right. At some point (which is not now, maybe phase 3) there shouldn't be a heavy need to deep prot.
---
Aye man there is a classic version, link is on the curse curseforge page.
---
I'm personally using it because I couldn't get grid to appear as anything but a black rectangle :/
---
So by paying you for your labor your employer supports your agenda and politics? Because they’re “allowing for you to have greater financial prospects with which to push your own agenda or politics”.
---
you’re telling me that you can use this spell to do what it’s intended to do?!? Gee willikers!
---
Plus, you get free money when you sue!
---
I’m with you man.
---
I feel sorry for you dog!
---
&gt;Retail sucks man, noone cares about that, it is a single player game without soul, with an appearance and crate shop inside the game that already has a monthly subscription.
---
You should read more then.
---
Underrated comment
---
As shitty as it is, I cant fault blizz for sticking to their policies. Now if they are picking and choosing which "political statements" to punish, then it would be a different story. 
---
I've never seen anything else about it. So I still think they're in their own rights to punish.
---
You have 55 gold, you are doing fantastic. Don't worry about it.
---
If you feel you fucked up your quests , spam dungeons and you will be back on track
---
I think the problem is more that they went so scorched earth that in itself is political.  But I do think blizzard is taking a bit more flack here than they deserve.
---
I dont get how this is an issue, im not level 60 yet, but slowly making my way there, releasing DM relatively early is really just a "punishment" for those who had already farmed their pre-raid BIS and cant live without them, while also giving them something to do to catch up on it again, while you who are taking your time can start farming diremaul the second you hit 60 instead, why is this a matter of punishing casuals and catering to hardcore? if they dont release now and most people get their raid gear before DM launches then its a large amount of players who doesnt get to experience it, while launching it earlier will let more people run through and farm it?
---
I did literally none of those things.
---
I didnt attack or harass anyone, I used no hate speech and I didnt gate keep anyone.
---
Triple XP if you continue to harass the person you clicked ignore on.
---
What were you spending gold on? It's
---
Pretty easy to make it to 100g before 40 and then again before 50.
---
what is the pvp addon called?
---
Given that the MM tree now incentivizes you to *not use your pet* I wouldn't be even remotely surprised if there's a demon-free lock spec now.
---
Fuck Blizzard and fuck China. Canceled my sub.
---
Thank you! It's been such a fun way to relax and spend time with my husband and friends. :)
---
^ This.
---
Roll Need if you will equip the item and use it for your benefit. Not the group's benefit, your benefit. You have value too.
---
Roll Greed if it will likely get vendored or you are going to AH it.

Roll Pass if you value the bag space more than the item.

Been a player since the late 90's as a kid. Just canceled my subs. Screw the new blizzard

Cancelled my subscription, cannot overlook something like this. My parents grew up in totalitarian state, fought for freedom and my generation is lucky to live in a democracy. My monthly €12 won't bleed Blizzard dry but it's the most powerful step I can make. I hope and I believe I am not alone in this and the gaming community will stand up and voice their disagreement with Blizzard's disgusting behaviour. Could they even bend over more?!
---
I do not know what the comment was that you modded. But i do think that applying the Rule "No real world politics" in a Thread like this that is a direct result of Blizzard themselves taking a political stance feels a bit shortsighted.
---
This is a political issue and while not directly related to wowclassic it is relevant to everyone playing blizzard games.
---
As a Warrior, If I'm going 2h Arms, and my 2h is  like a 3.6sec swing time, do I just spam Slam?
---
I rushed pretty hard. Ret to mid 30s while healing dungeons along the way and holy for sm cath-end game mostly healing dungeon cleaves. I loved it, my original character was a Paladin but I didn’t start until tbc so classic has been a great experience. Questing solo was a pain but using general chat I was often able to find people to group with. I’ve cleared MC and Ony 3-4 times now and it hasn’t gotten old at all I love seeing my guildies get epics and I’ve gotten a few myself.
---
Started running out of stuff to do on my pally so I decided to start leveling a farming class. Went with warlock because free mount gang. Last night I met another lock at lvl 17 and when we hit 18 we jumped on our mains and ran eachother through BFD for the quests and that op wand.
---
Fuck Activision. Stop supporting these cunts.
---
It won’t match dps In a group, but a reckoning build with the proper gear could get close to solo dps.
---
I chuckled at this, thank you.
---
Nope, but cleave hits two mobs, so the more you can spam cleave, the more mobs you hit. 
---
Whirlwind hits 4 targets. 
---
More targets hit = more chances of a potential crit.
---
&gt; Dude stop spamming this shit all over the thread. You’re not contributing to the conversation.
---
Why?  Because you don't like having to squirm under the weight of your own fucking hypocrisy?
---
&gt; And yes I am going to make an effort. Luckily being in West US there are tonnes of small US startups, local farmers and farmers markets and hand-made goods.
---
You're not going to do dick and you know it.  Nothing is more pathetic than someone who can't even be honest with themselves, which is all I'm doing.
---
No, I just don’t really give a shit and think everyone’s overreacting.

It’s blizzard, not my local congressman.

It's almost like they're not your friend and only exist to extract money from you.
---
Pyrewood Vilage is good Alliance PVE server. Its almost always full and with great community
---
They're perfectly good comparisons. If someones going to say you support pro-authoritative rule because you kept your WoW subscription--its a perfectly good counter argument. We all use things from companies or countries that do bad, it doesn't mean you are openly in support of those bad things.
---
&gt; without actually doing anything
---
So canceling your sub to a game you enjoyed playing is “nothing”?
---
Since when does cynicism pass as a valid opinion? Just because you think you’re better than other people because of your indifference doesn’t make it so.
---
The blatant typos in some of these responses really do make me question the origins of the user responding.
---
As far as your last point goes, just because things have been wrong in the past doesn't mean it's a precedent that should continue to stand.
---
Can you truly support a company like this?
---
Yes sorry I’m new on Reddit and no it was not intentional mister rule number 5
---
Oh hey, you were the shadow priest I saw taking care of the alliance side of the mafia. I was the dude with 5 mages you saw killing the horde side of the colluders. Sorry about the instakilling you once, I thought you were just another one of the craptacular horde I was clearing out.
---
Well that's exactly why they are doing things like this. They want to scare us. And so far it's working
---
It's fucking genius.  Use capitalist greed to destroy the western bond between free markets and democratic governance. 
---
Coupled with the rise of the authoritarian right  - western democracy is in jeopardy.  I never thought that would be a sentiment I'd truly believe.
---
Phobia implies irrational fear.
---
As a Chinese person, I can say fear of China is very rational.
---
I could see what you're saying. An issue I have is that reportedly "Blizzard has also fired both casters present during the stream, both of which physically ducked out of shot and cut to commercial after Blitzchung's statement."

I hope that all Esports players take a stand against this blatant cowardly abuse. Without you all, there is no Esports scene. Many of you are probably scared of taking a stance, you have your reasons and we understand, but that's what they are counting on. The Esports scene is still new and fresh, and they want to take advantage of you. You all have a bargaining chip, and you can all use it. Please remember that these companies do not care about you. We the players have given unprecedented support to you all to give you the chance of playing in the big leagues. From watching you all as streamers, to donating and subscribing to you all, and to giving money to the organizations and teams you represent. Take a stand, support your fellow Esport players, form a union and protect your rights. Protest and condemn the actions of the companies in charge of your game!
---
A large number of games are currently owned by China backed companies, here is a list of gaming companies Tencent, a Chinese conglomerate has invested in. Here are a few notable ones:
---
Riot Games (League of Legends) - 100%
---
Epic Games (Fortnite) - 48.4%
---
Bluehole (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) 11.5%
---
Activision Blizzard (Hearthstone/Overwatch/World of Warcraft) - 5%
---
It’s worth noting for background that Activision works with NetEase, another Chinese gaming conglomerate to manage its games in China, which actively censors and removes anything that China isn’t okay with. They are also developing the mobile port of Diablo Immortals, a game they planned on introducing to China, but marketed it towards the rest of the world and it failed spectacularly. We were never the intended target audience for the game.
---
What Blizzard has done to Blitzchung shows how easily your livelihoods can be ruined in an instant. They withheld his winnings and have swiftly banned him from competing in any Hearthstone related Esport event. I and many others will not support this behavior. We support the Esport players willing to stand with us and fight against oppression.
---
Gamers stand with Hong Kong for an open and free world!
---
Spread this.
---
I mean thats exactly what DM is....  So what exactly are you trying to say here?
---
each raid tier can keep you busy for a couple months, i suppose. and new ultimate soon!
---
When was recall added then? BC?
---
I know you're joking but you just described my exact setup... (except I don't overclock).
---
And WoW Classic is the only game installed on my PC currently.
---
Another example how capitalism destroys any attempt at democracy.
---
Capitalism at it's worst
---
Not how it works fam.
---
But you realize that if all those lvl 60's have a huge head start and are in full raid gear once BG's are released, you're going to get stomped every single game? 
---
In the original timeline when BG's were released, only the top guilds were progressing through MC/Ony, and now you have pugs of fresh 60's farming MC.
---
In WoW classic, by the time BG's are released, every dipshit with half a brain will be running around in full epics, and the pvp rewards will be useless unless they make the rewards BWL tier.
---
They really fucked up with this easy-mode balance patch.
---
If they dropped one of the raids early I’d be inclined to agree but this is a catch-up mechanic dungeon intended to make it easier for people to raid so idc what people are complaining about
---
Grinding and questing. Don’t worry about your mount at exactly 40, especially as a Druid. You’ll get there, and with 55 gold already you’ll likely have it by 40/41 anyway.
---
Dungeon grinding can be effective if you can find a consistent group for multiple runs. I wouldn’t waste time trying to find a new group for every run that you do unless you’re actually there for gear or a quest.
---
Quests give a fair amount of gold rewards. And grinding mobs like humanoids for greys and valuables is also a good way.
---
People want a platform they are familiar with to let off steam... It's not that hard a concept to understand is it?
---
It's was pretty cool back in the day when I was a wee lad but yea it's not that great.
---
Yes, I said I agree this is too much. But they are correct in giving a punishment. It was a HS interview, a political statement should not have been there.

I havent had a subscription in a while. I think people can still enjoy wow and make a statement to blizz, give them an ultimatum that their american and european customers believe in Democracy
---
People are telling you to pick the prot talents so you can tank. Don't listen to them. You can tank perfectly fine with the standard dps build in every single dungeon including UBRS. Stick with that build. If you are going to tank raids then respec to full prot before your first raid.

My characters name in classic was “Fakenews” yesterday I was required a name change and they still banned my account. I talked to a blizzard gm and he said “any names affiliated with politics is flagged as inappropriate”. What a joke of a company

Wait... do you not know how contracts work?
---
The other commenters are right. We actually did this by accident. Hit fly at the exact same time so it looked like we were on the same wyvern in between wing flaps.
---
Canceled my sub.  No more money to blizzard until something is done.  I value personal freedoms far more than whatever entertainment value I get from Blizzard.  Maybe this is the push I need to try something other than WoW.  To be totally transparent I'll be playing classic till my sub runs out.  They already got my money after all.
---
Deleted my bnet account. Not playing these garbage ganes anymore anyway
---
I want to heal raids/ tank dungeons and use SoC w the same build. is this dumb?

So I can't post here if I don't play it? Do this reddit have a sub check before you're allowed to comment lmao?

How did u get WW axe at 32?

Might as well just not vote with that kind of apathy...

I actually looked it up today and what i could find said 2009.  Either BC or WOTLK.  Sadly its unlikely we’ll ever see it in Classic.
---
That is true, and I agree with you there. But I'm not even really talking about the reporters, as much as Blitzchung himself.
---
If I got anything wrong, please, let me know. I'm just stating my opinion as I see the situation.

You mean like the petition to get Classic WoW? ;)

I get your point, just funny that "we" signed a petition and actually got what we wanted.

How odd, getting talked shit for not caring about a city full of people fighting to keep their rights.

So what to do when people leaving the game? Make even more people leave the game.
---
Someone's been reading thottbot for tips I hear ;)
---
This needs more attention
---
No literally the warrior ability overpower. It counters evasion.
---
I think what people are also forgetting is the impact releasing Dire Maul will have on the economy.
---
Probably more a lack of people wanting to take that sort of more stressful role. I see plenty of fury warriors running around and some of them will tank but oftentimes they will just wait for someone else who is more eager to instead.
---
Problem is alot of dmg is from multi and aimshot which take top end dmg not dps. Also you dont clip your autoshoot with a slow bow vs fast which would suprise you in how much dps loss clipping a couple autos will give you over time.
---
Also thorium arrows aint cheap :P
---
Just wait it out, it will bounce back. I've seen Jade at 12s, I've  sold all of mine for 30s

Said the husband standing arm's reach of his wife.
---
Yes, but you aren't thinking about the fact that a warrior isn't a headless chicken, either. There are ways to shut down a rogues ability to run away. Namely bleeds, hamstring, intercept, charge out of combat, etc. You are proposing the best case scenario for a rogue, and worst case for warrior.
---
if you're honored it's only 90g
---
The worse part is they are operating on US soil. Let's see how long there company would last if you were based in China. Everything would be stripped and sold to chinese companies.
---
It's true. I'm lucky enough to have the time as I don't have kids and I work from home so I can make sure my schedule matches up with my husband's. The journey is really where it's at. Congrats on 36!
---
Then play more. It’s really that simple. Classic wow was always about splitting the player base into layers of players. Those that played more - got rewarded.
---
People aren't upset about the fucking Hong Kong crisis or trying to fix it dude. Get a clue. This about China's power over American companies, and is part of a broader pattern (see the NBA incident going on at the same time). We give a fuck because China clearly aiming to dictate speech all over the world and use private companies to enforce it for them. We don't want to accept living in a world where no matter where you are you have to stay silent to appease the Chinese market.
---
My argument is no other company is taking a stance on Hong Kong. Blizzard was forced into the situation and wants to continue their neutral stance. Blizzard is being branded and boycotted while taking the exact same stance as EVERY international corporation. No employer would allow employees to use company time and money to push a personal political agenda on clients and customers.
---
This is selective outrage.
---
Dude, I go through 60 waters an hour doing bed runs, that's 4.8g. Lol. 
---
I do agree that you can get around using a mage. I get 5-6 stacks in org from a mage before I even start looking for a group.
---
Feels like no drop is much more prevalent for Classic, especially on Beasts :/

That's a shitty system. I've never had any ninja issues in PuGs except for a couple people trying to need on 50s items for disenchants (both stopped when asked). Everyone rolling need on a 100g BoE is one thing (that makes sense in a PuG because it's safe to assume no one is ever going to put on a 100 gold item just for leveling, especially this early) but if you need on a blue BoE item that sells for 3g on the auction house and deny your party mate from an upgrade because you think someone *might* ninja you're just a dick and you're taking the game too seriously.

That says a lot about you. If you find it hard to believe people can easily step away from a game maybe it’s because you yourself would struggle to do so. If walking away from a video game is hard to do you have serious problems with your (one) life’s priorities.
---
I haven't seen anyone else with one in the horde areas. Long trip and took a couple hours but it was worth it.
---
Good for Blizzard.
---
These anti-Communist, right wing dissidents have no place on their platforms.
---
Even though they are one of the most played they still aren't 1/5th of the characters..not too many bear tanks out there. And a good amount want to DPS only 40+
---
It’s really cringey how retail pukes feel the need to come to the Classic subreddit to tell everyone how Classic just makes them want to play retail even more because they like the nice, easy, instant gratification instead of earning it and learning to play your class by leveling up the way it was originally designed...
---
You're oversimplifying a complex situation.
---
Right, but you and I both know this issue isn't mainstream enough to make a real difference. Every person on every Blizzard product forum (including reddit) could cancel their account *today* and probably not make a big impact on their overall bottom line.
---
Money talks, sure---but people dont realize how quiet their voice is when voting with their wallet.
---
I suspect we'll see more deleted responses than final upvote tally, but still a great post.
---
good for you, just to be clear, they own a lot of other brands too:
---
https://www.zmescience.com/science/nestle-company-pollution-children/
---
Agreed. Thank you. 
---
I think across the three versions of this post I've made, this is the most open minded.
---
As an explanation, I agree firing the casters was wrong. I'd add that to my posts but I believe this whole entire thing is such  a sensitive topic that I could never have everyone see my thoughts eye to eye. I'll leave the comments up for discussion , but genuinely thank you, u/Xander_Crews_RVA for helping me understand this some of the discussion a little more
---
Spec has nothing to do with it.  The shortage has to do with the actual number of players willing to babysit 4 other players and lead them through an instance while executing the role that usually gets blamed for wiping.
---
Agree 100%. DM adds items that 1.12 balanced specs need in order to fulfill their roles in a raid environment. Feral Tank and Unyielding Maul / Cloak of Warding is an excellent example of this.
---
While I don't agree with Blizzard, if I were to get outraged at every little thing these days I'd be left without anything. There are no places left that skeletons don't reside.
---
So. Which private server is everyone going to?
---
I'm only concerned with content coming out quickly because I don't want to end up in Outland by Christmas.  Well, I actually never want to end up in Outland.  Give me classic+ lol.
---
Hi, as someone already said: if you're worried about being "that" hunter, you're already on the good path.
---
Good pieces of advice already on this thread. I'd just add that messing up with any classes can have dire consequences but the hunter's ones are extremely visual so you get pointed out a lot, even by the least observant players.
---
Do your best, as this post shows you're willing to do, and you'll be fine. Just avoid dungeonning when you're not at your best. Like late night-early morning runs or whatever your play time schedule sets "late" to, because this is when you'll pull your worst move and you'll be the least able to deal with harsh/rude comments.
---
I am lvl 44 now, and never played hunter back in the days of vanilla so I am still learning the ropes.
---
Just so you feel at ease I'll share one "oh shit" moment I had:
---
It was late at night in Feralas, had find a group while questing and we were on a roll. Nice pug group, we were tearing through quests and everyone was nice to each other, complimenting here and there on moves discussing specs, joking etc.
---
Then we went to free that NE from  that corrupted place full of wasps. It's basically a hole with a ramp to the entrance. Everybody skips the ramp and jumps in. For whatever reason I made that jump 2 steps and first jumped down to a ledge before going in. 
---
That's when I realized I haven't dismissed the pet. Thanks to Elune it was just up above me on the edge, staring down at me. I tried to dismiss but "target out of sight". I was also targeted by a wandering wasp that couldn't find its way to me while the group was fighting downstairs.
---
It took some sketchy repositioning but I finally managed to dismiss and not pulling the whole ramp apart from that one wasp. Could have been worst, sure, but I was eager to show my best play and was pissed and it really made me sweat like a jug of iced sweat tea under the noon sun!
---
Shit happens, ours are just spectacular, that's just a feature of our elite class xD
---
1000% a Druid. Welcome to the pack, young one.

---
You are a Druid why do you even need a mount. 
---

---
Good point! I did a little digging and found that there isn't a single word that describes "rational fear".
---
I have been disciplined, but I may take time off for the PvP update.
---
You people? I like bg:s, doubt I am the only one. Wpvp is fun but why would bg:s have to wait? One does not exclude the other.
---
what's the name of the addon that is displaying your enemy's buffs?
---
it's literally performing the same function as Detect Magic, surprised it is even allowed
---
Yeah, read the post again.
---
If the only difference is more and more people become aware of the issue and talk about it, then its more than worth it.
---
What a fucking embarrassment. Fuck off Blizzard.
---
bro are you playing on controller or something lmao
---
You can suckle blizzards teat if you like, but I don't have any respect left for this company. Nobody is saying blizzard is breaking the law, theyre just greedy assholes
---
I'm not giving you gold because f reddit. You have a donation page I can throw real money at?
---
Man and just when it looked like their stock was starting to recover from the Diablo Debacle
---
&gt; Believe Private servers 
---
Oh boy, a retail shill.
---
Do yourself a favor and ask any of the top Warriors playing Classic. None of them will tell you improved cleave is a good choice, especially when you’re forgoing MS.
---
Well, OK. Enjoy your evening.
---
People could be gilding you with coins from times they were gilded themselves. I'm an optimist sometimes. lol
---
(but yes I agree don't give money to this site)
---
You're conflating damage control with not caring about a boycot.
---
They absolutely care if we unsub, but they know China is a bigger market so it's wroth upsetting part of the west but keeping many players from there, than being banned from China altogether.
---
I think it would serve as a good thing to make them have to choose between two less profitable circumstances and start to force the issue of Chinas unrelenting propaganda out into public discussion.
---
Found the enlightened centrists
---
Oh yeah, if they release phase 2 when the casuals are in their late 40s, early 50s, damn they're going to HATE IT. They'll get hunted for HKs by 5 man gank squads. It could actually push some casuals away from Classic and endgame
---
Slam is a lot better against casters/enemies with slow attack speed.
---
Psh, 4am, no way am I finishing up for the night any earlier than 8am.
---
I deleted my 15-year old account today.
---
18 days here brother, i got college whole week and work each weekend, you either wake up early or you just dont sleep
---
Yeah I don't understand either. After working just an 8 hour day by the time I get home I have the drive to play games for an hour or two and I crave to go outside or see my friends. Weekends are a different story though. If I have nothing on the go I'll play all day.
---
Wow classic is probably the most casual friendly version of the game to be released.
---
That’s trippy this dude does not look like he lives in Cuba at all.
---
This.  
---
This is the best answer. US Govt kills hundreds of thousands to millions with 20 years of war on terror and sanctions to poor nations and everyone REEEs at a company protecting millions of Chinese accounts. Blame the CCP and the USA govts, not the companies making games.
---
&gt; left-leaning and/or non-retarded
---
A paradox.
---
What's even funnier is that Dire Maul came out sooner during the original release schedule than it's coming out now. It literally came out a month after vanilla launch, so people are arguing for it to be SLOWER than it was before
---
the literal first thing I said is that I don't belive it will make a difference, you dummy.
---
I'd just rather buy non-Nestlé products because making the switch is so easy. it also doesn't make any grand difference that I don't buy bottled water or use straws, but it's an incredibly easy change to make, so I did.
---
there should be one free realm change iirc?
---
Lol like we haven't known this shit for 15 years?   Where the fuck have you been?  Jeeze
---
Not to mention the mods are censoring all the posts about it for “outside political topics” complete bs.
---
They want to feel hardcore but have a safe, boring pve server 1-60 experience
---
You tell all these wanna-be virtuous posers!  No one is as virtuous as you!
---
Oh so you DO moderate this sub? Perhaps you can start removing all of the posts that are calling anyone that doesn't say "murder rich people, fuck China, fuck capitalism" a shill of some sort?
---
Perhaps you should be allowing politics even in this case since this sub is clearly only able to engage in a conversation at a teenage level.
---
Damnit Blizzard. Seriously. I was enjoying Classic more than I've enjoyed a game since....well...Vanilla WoW. I refuse to continue to support a company that makes decisions like this.
---
I guess I'll just wait the few weeks for Archeage Unchained to come out.
---
It's been a blast guys, but unless Blizzard does something incredible to reverse this decision and make it right, I'm officially done with them.
---
Does that mean 200-300g? Because that I agree with. I'd probably say all need on any BoE that drops while leveling worth more than 10g. Needing on a 2g item so you can sell it on AH that's an upgrade for your party mate however is what's known as a huge dick move.
---
Owned by the same company that invested in Blizzard btw lmfao
---
Supply and demand boss man. 
---
Think of it this way you have 2 tanks for a 40 man raid ( sometimes a few more ) compared to 30 some odd dps. This also applies to out of raid content. It’s much easier to find a dps than a tank      
---
They are rare commodities
---
You hit exalted before lv40?
---
Wow you really are that dumb arnt you? Simply amazing
---
Yes, the single most important thing of any random customer is them purchasing the product lol
---
There was a million ways of handling it better. Taking away the player's prize, banning him and then firing casters is a nuclear option disproportionate to the deed in question.
---
The comments must be trying to reverse-troll you.
---
Morgraine PvP is full, but i have yet to have any queue at Primetime
---
\^This is the mindset of a person who truly believes that their actions have no influence over the world. Oh boohoo the world is shitty but I'm so powerless I can't do anything to stop it, guess I'll just suck it up and accept  whatever happens. Weak.

r/vanilla wow
---
Tons of private servers out there, and they *don't* support an authoritarian government. Looks like I'll be picking up where I left off in WOTLK.
---
Asking the important questions
---
I have to say, you were looking pretty dumb and now your just outright confirming it. If you think that American concentration camps started just last year, boy do I have a history lesson for you...
---
Which bits specifically? I wanna know what Im lookong for when I do this.
---
I've uninstalled 5 games. canceled my wow sub. will refuse to play during the OW holiday events and wont purchase Diablo 4 or any thing Diablo 3 related, I was never going to pickup D:I so that's mute point. Im also not purcahsing the Blizzcon virtual ticket.
---
Activision-Blizzard has lost ~$200 from me from this. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/yLErZAO.png

Or just not play the game at all. If you don't like loot competition you won't enjoy raiding.
---
100% because you use you phone to take pictures
---
You fundamentally don't understand the situation with China if you think that is a viable option to stay in their good graces. 
---
I mean, that sort of statement wouldn't even fly in America. If someone says something inappropriate on radio, the station is held responsible by the FCC. Not the host. Not the person actually responsible.

This video sums up AA nicely.
---
Dire Maul is just another 3 additional dungeons.  It's not a gear reset, or another level of difficulty or anything.  There are a few really nice blue items that come from DM that you farm like any other piece of your pre-raid BiS set.  What most people are  upset about is that if you know how to watch youtube videos, and have the right class, you can solo certain aspects of the DM (like princess runs in mara), and make pretty good gold by doing it.  More gold means inflation in the economy, and if you don't have a class that can do the solo farms, money is going to feel more scarce.
---
Yeah I’m not canceling. I’ve waited for this game. I’ve been camping at the bit to play and have had a lot of fun in the last month. I’m going to have more fun in the coming months. I hope things work out for the people of HK and I hope China changes. But that shit is far beyond my ability to influence. I’ll be on the game that makes me happy to play.
---
I just unsubbed because of it, im sure im not the only one.
---
&gt; Big Chinese companies are heavily controlled by the authoritarian state. Stay away from them.
---
Big chinese companies are often originally never existing, But if you wanna do business in china, You've gotta get chinese onboard in your company. And at tech shows, One year there'll be your company and product. Five years down the line, there's gonna be a chinese company with the same exact product as you, Just bigger, And they will overshadow you.
---
Then people will call you the copycat company.
---
Can you really heal raids with this? I'm not sure yet if I wanna tank or heal once I hit 60
---
They may not REALIZE it, that's true. But I think they will notice it without understanding the causes. They will just be like "Wow, the stuff in this game is super expense" and it will hur their enjoyment. But like I said, let's see how it plays out, just my hypothesis.
---
It's still blizzard. It's not like the VOD was hosted by the Taiwanese government
---
Blizzard “Taiwan” are the ones who took the video down.  As far as chain of command goes directly it is Blizzard NA &gt; Chinese Government &gt; Blizzard Taiwan.  It’s likely the government has in its clause they can ask Blizzard Taiwan to take down content they deem unsavory to the country.  A decision that would of been made locally by Taiwanese officials and not ever involved anyone outside of China or Taiwan.  Blaming the head of Blizzard for letting this happen is like shifting the blame of a 16 year old to his parents.

God I miss Legion so much
---
Even though I know in retrospect that it was easily the single most destructive expansion in WoW's history in terms of class changes, features removed, and mechanics introduced, it was still one of the three (now four) times I genuinely enjoyed WoW (alongside Vanilla, TBC, and Classic)
---
The zones were great, the classes were great, the artifacts were great, the raids were great, the dungeons were great, the cheesy voice lines were great, the aesthetics were great, the armor looked great.
---
&gt; It wasn't
---
Well, it was. You're just extremely wrong. You can ask literally everyone who played at a somewhat high-end level back than. The class balances etc that rolled out nerfed all the content significantly.
---
Maybe though they have been walking around at slow speed since level 1.  Druids aren’t Shamans and Hunters who get speed at 20 though I couldn’t imagine not taking feline swiftness as a Druid while leveling.
---
In classic, mob health data is not available as a number, so addons that display it show percentages based on an esitmate of total boss health based on damage done, which is why you always see 100.
---
And other people like to go on reddit just to make themselves mad. 
---
There are so many different kinds of people in the world.
---
Sure, but you can limit your support for china, not buying chinese brands is one of the biggest ways.    
---
It's the same with global warming - the fact that you are living, buying stuff, creating waste - isn't good, but you can always limit that.
---
It's staggering and frustrating to see the world drops like this.  They are so freaking rare as shit, I never got one in Vanilla years or any other for that matter.
---
Absolutely yes of course it will. Blizzard will not make it situation right in any meaningful way. 
---
Best case scenario, they may have banned the casters specifically to later lift their ban to pretend like they're being reasonable.
---
Why give reddit money after everything they've done?
---
You did say that, you said it’s hypocritical to protest this specific issue and not other (bigger) issues in the community. Protesting isn’t a zero sum game. People can choose to protest multiple things.
---
Yeah that is good clarification- I meant to downrank to avoid overheal but yes only try and heal yourself once =P
---
Click the link and read?
---
Agreed, they're not going to be worrying about money any more than they already do because of this.
---
Haha you're cute... you really think you make a difference
---
I've done cocaine. I will continue to sometimes. WoW is worse than cocaine. At least I get some feeling of a rush from the drug. From WoW I don't know why I'm playing it everyday.
---
Username *really* checks out when taking about Blizzard
---
The rest of the WoW community is definitely exaggerating on how difficult they are to level. I didn't even learn cooking and I barely use bandages between pulls. This wasn't meant as a brag, but I guess if your takeaway from my post is that I'm so good, then I suppose you're right.
---
This saved my life
---
If you really want to stick it to blizzard over this then everyone should stop their subscription to all of their games.

I've actually found playing during my free time to be a real improvement over what I was doing previously. I'm single, and usually after work I'd go hang out at the bar with some friends. I've been drinking too much as a result, and gained a bunch of weight. 
---
Having something to come home to in the evenings instead of drinking my life away at happy hours has been a real improvement. I hang out with friends I almost never get to see because of distance in discord. I've met new friends through the game, and I've lost 8 pounds since launch. I'm keeping up with my irl friends too, if it's a specific event I'm gonna go hang out with them, but cutting back on going to the bar has saved me a shit ton of money, and I'm feeling better than I have in months. I'll take the mild sleep deprivation over a hangover any day. Am I switching one addiction for another? Probably. But overall, I think this is an improvement.

No Spirit Tap is the real shame, but it's an NE Priest so min/maxing was definitely not our their mind either.
---
Few people are privileged/wealthy enough to live a life free of any moral shortcomings. I know that setting a bar of what's okay is completely arbitrary, and I understand that buying a company's product doesn't necessarily mean you're supporting their actions, so I don't try to be some outstanding citizen by refusing to buy anything.

This is just pandering to convenience and niavety, you live in a capitalist society we all do and the only true vote you've ever had in that society is where you spend your money.
---
You're attempting to tell people that short term gains are worth far more than long term ones essentially. Does WoW make me happy now? Yes. Will a future where Communist China to any significant degree controls what can and can't be done in entertainment, art and society at large be an enjoyable future? Absolutely not.

Do not give up your agency simply because it is hard to keep, grip it that much tighter.

Do you know how many games have came out during wows tenure? At this point people who play wow will play. There is no wow killer other than itself and it doesn't really matter what other games do.
---
Tons of the Chinese gold farming industry in the early days of WoW was forced prison labor with profits going to the Chinese state bosses.
---
Yup, I gave all my stuff to a buddy and uninstalled
---
I canceled my sub and let blizzard know the reason. As much as I’ve hoped and prayed for classic. It is just a game
---
My problem isn't people cancelling their accounts--if you think this is worth cancelling your account, great. You do you.
---
But the people who take the moral high-ground because they think they're fighting the big bad communist China party are delusional. They (including you and I) support Chinese atrocities every day because of the products we use.
---
Cancel your subscription because you think its morally right. Don't make a stink with the same zeal because your phone manufacturer supports slavery. You cant have it both ways and not be a hypocrite.
---
I am in the same boat.
---
I care about Hong Kong. But I am also having so much fun in classic. I unsubbed today and I am gonna take a break for the next few days. I wrote in the reasons  for canceling that i was ashamed of their actions as a company based out of California as a fellow Californian. 
---
I will see how it plays out- probably nothing will happen who knows.
---
The people artists, writers, coders, actors, everyone who made WoW Classic and WoW Retail don’t have a thing to do with the business decisions made by the hire ups. Blizzard is partly owned by a Chinese company. For all we know it might not have been Blizzard that forced this to happen.
---
That doesn’t make what happened any less fucked up. It’s horrible. Hong Kong needs our support. You have to find your way of supporting them. Honestly you gotta do what you think is right. 
---
There’s so many wrong business dealings going on in the world, it’s hard to boycott everything. Nestle is a terrible company for using basically slave labor to get their chocolate, while at the same time stealing water from lower developed communities. Everything is terrible. You have to draw your own personal line somewhere.
---
Nobody getting blacklisted unless written rules were decided upon first so Blizz can verify at what was decided before hand.
---
It's not that Chinese people have more purchasing power than the West, it's that the Chinese government takes a MUCH more active role in what its citizens do and don't consume. Make a PR fuckup in the West and you'll lose a portion of your audience. Make a PR fuckup in China and you'll get blacklisted and lose ALL of your audience.
---
Ok, be it as you say. Let's say Blizzard would have allowed this. Do you guys even take these things into considerations? China could ban Blizzard in China like they did with just about every major tech company. Do you know what happens if Blizzard loses China? Disaster. They would probably have to cut from just about every department of the company. That means games development, esports events, contents, quality of support and a lot more.
---
Think this trough please. I know a lot of people tend to believe that higher purposes can be excused from the rules for their reason. But behind the scenes, it's a harsh game(no pun intended) that forgives nobody.
---
I think Blizzard knows far better than you how many players are what level.
---
I think they also understand the rather basic principle of "If people playing our game run out of content they will stop playing our game".
---
"I'm dumb, look at me"
---
They're the same... Devalue means that 1 gold will have less buying power, so that 1g quest reward won't help you as much once you reach level 60. And the currency will have inflation as more gold floods into the game.
---
I feel like I've been no-lifing classic since launch. I got my mage at 60 with almost full pre-bis. I've gotten to raid MC once and hit shazzrah before we had to give up for the night.  
---
Dinged 60 last week. In reality I'm not fast to 60, nor am I slow. I have a full time job, but use my spare time mostly playing. I'm no efficient, I'm taking my good time doing everything my way. I feel like a true casual compared to some of these people I see online.  
---
I can only imagine what the more casual players must feel. Dire Maul launching in a week is way too early. I'd love more content, but it would mean MC is less valued due to all the gear DM brings.  
---
I'm truely conflicted. I do want to be able to make lv 55 water. But I do also want to savor MC before additional content becomes available.  
---
I mean.. Clearing MC with DM gear won't get my epeen hard.

Welcome to the moral conundrum that is being woke under capitalism.
---
Blizzard bows to China, but you like their products what do you do?
---
The knee jerk reaction is to withdraw your money. That's fine. You can do that, there's nothing wrong with doing that.
---
Problem: Other companies you use have also bowed to China. And most times ***you don't even know it.***
---
Other companies you use have done things that could be arguably worse than a lot of things China has done.
---
Have a Google about Nestlé. Now look up what they own. Have fun avoiding them.
---
Now consider that Nestlé *also plays chummy with China*.
---
Oops. You're in the same moral conundrum, but now it's with *stuff you need to survive*.
---
So what do you do?
---
No, seriously. What do you? There's not actually a right answer here.
---
So, don't get down on those who keep paying and playing. *They don't have a choice*, and neither do you. In the immediate future at least.
---
In a more broad sense, you do have a choice. But that's not about what products you buy or what games you play, it's about how you vote. And that can of worms (and probably most of this post tbh) is against the no politics rule. So I'll stop right there.
---
None of this makes sense. Bow to Winnie the Pooh over there and piss off a HUGE chunk of your fanbase. I urge anyone, no matter where you are, to stop any subscription you have with Blizzard and do not buy anything of theirs again. This is just disgusting.
---
Christ.  You guys are a joke
---
Oh fair enough. That does make sense. Thanks homie.
---
A spec is fine, in fact I always thought dark pact and demonic sacrifice should have swapped places, the affli lock cares not for demons.
---
But yeah wouldn't be surprised to hear they just got removed entirely, hell didnt we lose demonform somewhere along the line?
---
Good on blizzard. Regardless of your views, affiliation, or stance on anything, you are an entertainer. I said the same with the NFL. If you want to go and push your views on your fans and audience, you get to enjoy the punishment from both sides. Just play the game and keep your thoughts and views out of it.
---
Yes, the deep Resto tree actually is really bad aside from Swiftmend and we can’t justify Swiftmend very much until we have enough gear for better mana management. HOTW is actually considered amazing early on for healing due to so much extra mana, it puts me up to 5.5k (RIP drinking level 45 water).
---
My healing outside is actually really strong
---
I'm not being forced to write anything, I truly don't buy the bourgeoisie propaganda that China is even half as bad as they say it is. On the contrary, America is the authoritarian government.
---
There he is now, behind you!
---
HE’S GOT A BROOM.
---
&gt; But I don't want to hit fresh 60 when Phase 5 is rolling out and I would be so far behind.
---
You are going to be far behind. That's just the way it is. Most players in vanilla *never* "caught up", they progressed on Ony/MC/ZG and never experienced higher raids even after the content had been out for a long time. The great thing about classic is new content mostly doesn't affect your personal progress. You don't have to be ready for new raids when they come out, just keep doing what you're doing
---
Mage, hunter, or warlock is the usual advice. 
---
Mages can AOE farm. Hunters and warlocks can farm some dungeons easier due to ability to do damage while moving from range and their pets. Hunters are generally a bit better than warlocks for farming.
---
+Intellect helps too ;)
---
This place is a cesspool of an entirely different kind, much more group think behavior along with people acting self righteous. 4chan is a more honest place. I like being called retarded or much worse more than being downvoted.

Lol your direct boss, as in the one directly above you, is the CEO of the world's largest business services firm? Forgive me while I wait for proof.

how much dps do these theoretical druids and warlocks and mages do in your head? just wondering
---
How to come across as insufferable ^
---
Pretty sure the ddos launched by one person cost blizzard more money than the revenue from any one person’s WoW sub. So, clearly, one customer is capable of doing far more damaging acts against blizzard than canceling their sub. 
---
&gt; if everyone who was upset did that they would then feel it collectively in the only thing that matters which is profits
---
So you have accurate numbers of the share of blizzard’s customers around the world, and their opinion on the HK protests? You know that if all of those who are upset about blizzard banning one hearthstone player for political statements made at a blizzard event decided to cancel their subs it would have a meaningful impact on blizzard’s profits? Feel free to share that data.

&gt; no one in the US gives a shit about that game or ever will

And that's great, because people over in china will pay fuck loads on MTX.

[The servers have always been indicated as Eastern Time Zone and Pacific Time Zone on the server lists on the forums](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294395/wow-classic-name-reservations-open-today), they probably just updated them in-game to show which is which.
---
Currently, there are no server transfer mechanisms other than the occasional free transfer they enable from full servers to low-population servers. It really is only a time-zone issue though. I'm fairly certain all servers are located geographically in a similar location due to how server virtualization works now, meaning your latency shouldn't be drastically different between an EST or PST server.
---
Early 30's.  You're going to be in and out of STV until level 45, so don't just try to set up camp there and level exclusively from STV quests.  Accept all the quests you can get, bang out the yellow ones, then go to other zones and do their quests.  When you level, return and bang out all the yellow quests again.  Rinse and repeat until you're done with the quests eventually somewhere in the early 40's.

What is the best macro for a warrior to quickly equip a shield and bash to interrupt?

I’ve seen many variants all claiming the others don’t work or are slow.

Are there any other macros that will make my life as a brand new warrior easier?

I just unsubbed from WoW with 'Free Blitzchung' in the reason for leaving. I got perma banned 5 minutes later and can't log in to tell my guildies I am quitting and my real ID friend list is gone.

If everything is destroyed, what good will 428 sq mi of land do? Their country is big enough and has already enough ghost cities.
---
They only want HK if it brings them money, which will inevitably become worthless under their rule, given that HK's rise is heavily due to their economic freedoms and lack of government.
---
Classic is way less addictive than cocaine.
---
Is there anyone in here willing to have an actual discussion surrounding this mess? Seems that everyone is doubling down on the Blizzard hate but it seems to me they were put in an impossible situation.
---
Notice how all the trash companies support China and give into to them, the NBA is the worst national league right now. And blizzard-Activision is somehow now worse than EA.
---
As soon as i read "the ridiculous notion that customers want to interact with the companies" i knew I'd read it before
---
I’ve uninstalled my blizzard games, I stand with you in solidarity.
---
Just trying to get this clear bc you are preaching “be informed”. Are you implying being informed will lead one to side with China here? Are you informed? Do you believe China is handling this situation well. Do you believe the Chinese government acts with good will towards its people. What’s your opinion on re education camps? What about organ harvesting? Or the government treatment of Islamic people? Inform me.
---
Essentially you're telling Blizzard **what they did**, not **why you are canceling**.
---
Pointing out peoples hypocrisy doesn't make you some enlightened genius. We're all aware. Change needs to start somewhere and for many people, this is it. Enjoy making sarcastic comments at people who are taking action, no matter how small it is. It's your basic human right to do so.
---
As I understood the rule, it was broad enough that if they felt it could hurt their brand the player would be penalized. I also took umbrage with them firing the casters next to him for just having been present when it happened.
---
Okay, if anyone unironically wants to do this, instead of doing it to Mei simply because she is Chinese, you should do it to the most annoying character in the game. That way you will fuck over Blizzard AND make the game better.
---
...Mei is definitely getting the axe, isn't she?
---
Herod, Horde. Looking for a nice, active guild. I really enjoy utter chaos so if your guild is full of weirdos or strong personalities I would love to join in. I also love to watch drama unfold but no worries, I don't partake in it! Except when someone throws an unjustified tantrum, sometimes I can't resist and still poke them a little bit... Just... to see what will happen
---
 I work full time but play almost every evening and weekends. Sometimes I "work" from home.  
---
Currently level 49, I don't plan on hurrying up on the leveling but I do plan on raiding as soon as I can. I'm a shadow priest - unpopular class, but good, I promise, try me! And I don't suck at the game -.
---
I don't really do PvP but I will once the honor system is in. I let any humanoid player live (basically only gnomes are KOS). 
---
So basically, very dedicated shadow priest looking for guild with potential raiding options, preferably a bunch of (adult) weirdos. An active Discord would be a big plus. Name's Mozguz. Thanks :D
---
DM was released 2.5 months after original launch. What people don't realize is that 2.5 months after the original launch there were probably less raiders than there are now, only a month into classic.
---
Damn, thats nice to know!
---
I prefer healing to tanking, but going deep resto definitely keeping me from doing it, since I enjoy WPVP a lot and I feel like it makes the  class "weak" for it. Even though it makes you quite unkillable, I still prefer going feral for the pvp funsies
---
No helpful guildies?
---
Some of us have friends and family in Hong Kong who are directly affected by this. It wasn’t so long ago that the USA was resisting a tyrannical government and, with the aid of a foreign government, broke free from the reign of King George III.
---
If the French government and people had said “nah, we shouldn’t care about America because we should only focus on French issues” then America would not be the country it is today.
---
Yes but the AAs/MS/Whirlwind will have a much higher chance to miss, and overpower has a six second cooldown iirc. His point is that you are likely to get hit with some overpowers anyway with your high dodge chance. May as well make it so all of the warriors other stuff is more likely to miss
---
Sure, that's today's top news regarding blizzard
---
I guess no one remembers that pre-Wrath all content was relevant to someone. There will always be guilds in MC when AQ is out. There will always be fresh 60s that are looking for their prebis. Just because more content is coming out doesn't mean you will miss it because it will become irrelevant.
---
The...title..?
---
+1 to those who said make bandages and vendor.  The price of cloth on the AH will go up eventually but it may be a while
---
And why can't they? What happens if they do?
---
But that's 100% factual?
---
Basically updating it daily by doing a scan at the AH will give you accurate percentiles so you can sort by that after that.
---
&gt;Most people appreciate tips on how to be better, but some people are stubborn and insist on being inferior.
---
The game's content is a joke as soon as you begin to even mildly care about how you're doing. Honestly, about 40% of the difficulty is on your raid leader alone, 20% in time invested, 25% fight knowledge and preperation, and maybe 15% individual skill. Some just want to enjoy goofy/all-in-one specs.
---
When you're in the long term committed kind of relationship a marriage is, things like staying up half the night gaming gets frowned on. 
---
Unless your s/o is also gaming half the night away ;)
---
That's ridiculous.
---
Thanks for the info. Isn't there an independent governance in HK?
---
I fucking hate what Blizzard is doing but there's nothing I can fucking do. I've been waiting for this for 13 years.

Are STV mobs usually heave leather+ and heavy hide? There’s absolutely no market for light and medium on my server lol.

As much as I love this suggestion it doesn't seem that America can make a principled stand for human rights in America and our senators are going to fix China? I'm referring to all the little brown children in border detention facilities with this comment.

&gt;Will this happen to WoW?
---
What makes WoW immune?
---
Motherfu- you mean to tell me my regular server was *not* down all morning and I just didn't notice the new tab for East Coast servers?
---
&gt;How about your phone? How about your car? Your computer? Did you give those things up too because of their companies support--outward or tacitly--for child labor and slavery?
---
Nobody in their sane mind would require you to go back to the stone age just because you wish to boycott a company / country. I certainly am not willing to give up my computer, phone or internet even though I try to avoid Chinese products like the Black Death.
---
However, WoW is in no way necessary for me, so I have no problems giving that up. I can still play it in fact, there are plenty of private servers to choose from.
---
You're guessing wrong. I just have a wife that doesn't have a problem with me enjoying my hobbies.
---
I can give you 30 silver and some linen cloth. You're welcome.
---
I assumed it meant the list was organized by that and didn't see the tabs for individual regions.
---
See edited original post good sir.
---
I'm a hardcore raider and I still think content is coming out too fast. I'm almost getting private server FRESH PTSD.
---
There is literally NO BENEFIT AT ALL from releasing content fast. None at all. Not even a little bit.
---
They can release all the raids back to back and they will still be cleared in less than 2 hours. Releasing the raids fast won't make them more interesting than releasing them late.
---
The best era of WoW is BEFORE AQ40, by a long shot. 
---
The best part of WoW is... the game, just being a part of the world. The raids is just something extra. Something social we do every week with our friends to get loot and have fun.
---
The real game is between raids, and the best between raids is in the first half of the game.
---
Please don't rush this game Blizzard. Just take it slow.
---
Unfortunately a lot of level 60s love to tank advantage of being finished leveling by going around slaying lowbies. 
---
There's no rhyme or reason (since there's no rewards), they just do it to get people riled up
---
Your best bet is moving onto another area or just taking a short break. Despite all the ganking, I haven't had anyone try to camp me yet.
---
Classic has been out for a little over 1 month.
---
If I remember correctly, Dire Maul was released 4 months after Vanilla launched and had items that at the time were seen as "catch up" gear for those who weren't raid geared.
---
This is where the sour taste in my mouth starts, and it finishes with the possibility that Blizzard will speed up content releases again with minimal notice in the future to appease the hardcore players that rushed through content.
---
(Seriously, they give us 1 week notice.....)
---
VERY MUCH THIS, thanks OP

Giving any more money to Blizzard at this time is accepting Blizzards actions. They showed to remorse for their player, took back his winnings, and you want to just give Blizzard more money? No... don’t do it. Don’t support them. They have done something that goes against everything to do with freedom and democracy. The only message they will understand is losing subs and money. That’s what they were afraid of by the actions they took. It’s our turn to show them that those actions were wrong and not give them any more money. 
---
Heck, we should be demanding all of our money back the same way Blizzard did to the player. They’ve mace a statement is support of dictatorship and have turned a blind eye on human rights. They don’t deserve our money anymore.
---
" What are we buying from the US government? "  
---
Good question! The US regime protects most ISP monopolies and subsidizes them. most large scale companies are protected and subsidized by them through IP enforcement.
---
not just WoW.
---
"League of Legends" is  China Company
---
Welp it's been real guys. My soul is not for sale. In 10 years when we are all enslaved by China you will NOT be able to look back on this...because it will be erased from the internet.
---
I'm just curious to know what you did or changed in your life to support the citizens of Hong Kong prior to the Hearthstone event?
---
The hit cap hes talking about is likely the 6-9% for abilities vs raid bosses.
---
There is a further 20% (IIRC) penalty applied to weapons, and more hit still benefits fury warriors (more rage, more damage), though crit also accomplishes the same thing with flurry synergy.
---
Or perhaps servers often make quite a bit off of tips, and even more than people in other customer service jobs.
---
Genius if he did it on purpose.
---
Hilarious if he didn't! 🤣
---
&gt;Saying people can't or shouldn't criticize that because their clothes came from sweat shops just seems wrong to me.
---
Im not saying people shouldn't criticize, they *absolutely should* blast Blizzard for this--they 100% deserve every bit of bad press they get. They are betraying their customer base in support of an antagonistic foreign government. 
---
But the people who think theyre better than everyone else because they cancelled their subscription--then virtue signaling by telling people about it, are just delusional.
---
So stunning
---
You are mad at the moment and you should take into consideration sleeping on this. Blizzard can lose it all if China wishes to. This is not a free forgiving world.
---
Big companies have no ethics. Wake up from your fairy tales because all these companies that ally themselves with different minority groups are actually following profits. They don't care about good and bad as long as the number are up.😑
---
Lvl 29 here. It does get better right?
---
I'm curious if moderation is at least done *partially* by Blizzard, on some level.
---
Not sure how anyone can support Blizzard after this.
---
Well spotted
---
That's not the point. He's trying to explain how one of Blizzard's biggest strategies is to release content at the exact same time as competitors to choke them out.
---
He literally asks what people do if the raid is half guild or half pug. You dumb shit.
---
I'm a level 55 rogue.  I'm roughly halfway to lvl 56.  Should I just be farming BRD for HoJ right now?  What levels do I start LBRS / UBRS?
---
Idk if a lot of people cancel their subs it is a ton more heavy handed and noticeable on their profits, which is all they care about anyway, if we can get a big wave of people to cancel and not give blizzard their money then this will be much more effective than petitions ever were.  
---
Sure you can think people are just pandering or being disingenuous or just wanting attention but the only way change for the better can be made is if we use the only power we have which is our wallets
---
At least you weren't looking for his wife.
---
This made me forcefully exhale through my nose. Thanks.
---
What?
---
Thank you for that info. I dug around further and found a simple addon that only adds the Overpower proc alerts, so one doesn't have to use a more complex, involved addon like weakaura. In case others are interested:
---

---
Back in Vanilla or BC when I was leveling my night elf I looted a pair of pants like this, except they were green. My characters hair color was green. I think you may know what I am getting at.
---
Only bad rogues don’t use evasion vs warriors. 
---
You already have a high dodge chance. You’re going to dodge and they’re going to overpower regardless of if you pop evasion. 
---
Popping it actually gives you a chance to survive by dodging all of their autos, their hamstring, that big crit ms or whatever. 
---
Use evasion.
---
Not a loss, only one way to act with toxic people!
---
time invested = experience, start a guild see who follows and if needed merge with other guild.
---
I understand all that. But since the non-overpower swings and abilities will have a huge chance to miss during evasion, isn't it still a net positive for the rogue?
---
Whats the name of the very low profile vendor/auction house price display for items? All the ones that get recommended give me way too much info, but i've seen a few screenshots of people who have *just* the vendor price and average AH price.
---
You must be joking,  there's no way almost half of them would believe they can work to wealth and power
---
Assuming tribute runs work I believe hunter has the fastest tribute run and it doesn't require any additional consumables
---
If you are running with other casters that need mana, you are probably going to be doing mega-aoe pulls, which means obviously there is going to be a lot more downtime between the pulls.
---
My wife doesn't seem to have a problem with it. Now don't get me wrong I'm not staying up half the night every night because I have a job that I don't want to be a zombie for, but when it does happen I don't anything more than a, "You're crazy" because she doesn't care if I'm enjoying my hobbies.
---
And it’s sad how many westerners fall for it.
---
I can't tell what's worse, this or the decision to release Dire Maul already

---
Do you work for blizzard? 
---
I'm more concerned for the countless political prisoners than their bottom line... Their games are incredibly popular. They were facing minor China blowback at best.
---
They easily could have clarified that he just plays in a league and his personal views don't necessarily represent blizzards.
---
Instead, blizzard is letting the Chinese government decide what non-Chinese gamers are allowed to say, play, and do. That's a horrible precedent and your take is terrible unless you're a blizzard employee trying to justify what your bosses just did.
---
He’s talking about endgame bis lists.
---
There are so many DPS warriors that don't want to tank in my experience. Idk what it is.  
---
They always say they're too nervous or don't have any experience and I'm not willing to push the issue when I'm running BRD farm groups
---
found a simple addon to alert you in case you're interested:
---
This isn’t phase 2. They separated DM, a 5 man dungeon from phase 2. The people that are crying about this need to understand that the content is already trivialized by updated talent trees, and improved loot. Releasing DM will do fuck all to prevent you guys from experiencing the game as those who are already 60 have. MC and almost certainly BWL are a joke because the current patch is not designed for that content.
---
Ya idk how that happened...
---
Could be. But virtue signaling is having just as bad of an impact--making people think they're making a difference when their difference is nill.
---
Idk, Though if it is Shaman do not go Resto until late game.  Playing my Shaman as Ench and I have been able to heal dungeons without a problem.  Just keep some Int gear handy.
---
The reason for doing it that way is that questing as Resto is more difficult.  Why make it more difficult?  When you can still heal.
---
Rogues to me are good characters to have as an alt.  That way you can afford to feed them new gear.  They are very gear dependent.  As a main rogue you will want to know where the weapon drops and quest weapons are so you can keep them upgraded.
---
Mages and warlocks are the least gear dependent until late game.  Their gear only effects their health and mana pools for most of the leveling process.  You don’t start seeing damage gear until later on.  So might think about going that route though in the end play what you want.
---
Watch me crit this guy sitting down! Holy shit did you see that? I'm a God!
---
Yeah I know I just meant your average person.
---
No, I went straight into pointing out that in reality there probably hasn’t been a lot of thought into this move, and the fact is he’s been supporting these places his entire life without ever being “outraged” or feeling like he is personally endorsing every immoral thing they do.
---
It's never been accurate
---
You can't cast Roots indoors.
---
What? Anything that has its IP protected is sold by the USA government? What dumbass argument is that lol.

I agree some IP is too stringent especially in pharmaceuticals/healthcare.

A $15 month video game subscription isn’t that though.
---
Either you’re &gt;18 years old or a paid Chinese Astro turfer. I think ur 12 tho personally
---
nice, i wish i could get my wife to play
---
That's fair at this stage in the games life, but I believe you understand the point I was making.
---
I've personally boycotted Epic games, especially their games store, and encouraged friends to do the same.  China's pretty omnipresent in the games market so it's pretty hard to avoid giving them money completely, but Epic is a particularly bad actor and easy to avoid.
---
Did you have a suggestion for how I could do more, or are you saying that I shouldn't take this step because I haven't been more active in supporting HK?
---
Yeah I see this too. Gonna keep at it until I get fed up. All of my friends keep wanting to stay. It’s definitely a lemming thing for me.
---
YES RETAIL IS UNIRONICALLY BAD ENOUGH WITH THIS DUMBASS COMMENT
---
Cause I support the president and aren’t stuck living in 2016? Don’t worry you’ll get am impeachment some day. If not this year maybe in four more years 😉

---
Content release shouldn’t cater to the timeline of the small servers.
---
The game will lose many more players by not adding content than it will by adding content that some servers aren’t quite ready for.
---
It's not an international gaming company, its an American gaming company that does business internationally.  I am not an idiot for expecting that they allow someone to (obviously while generically saying that views expressed are not necessarily their own) support a movement seeking human rights, because thats the American way regardless of what country they are in.  If they dont like that then they can take their bullshit fucking company elsewhere.
---
People are not wrong for expecting people and companies to do the right thing even if it hurts their bottom line.
---
Fuck yeah. Pro modding.
---
What you're posting is cringe. This guy is actually doing something, however minor, in the fight against totalitarianism and you're acting like your opinion of his self importance is the thing people need to here right now.
---
Kind of thinking the same thing. If there's an opportunity to raid on my schedule with my non-resto spec then I'll give it a chance but I'll probably just end up doing dungeons and battlegrounds.
---
See the difference is you mindlessly accept those things whereas I actively put effort into avoiding them. Im doing my small part as best I can (Because as you stated you can't escape Chinas influence) and you are doing jack shit.
---
Baby steps are required. Change doesn't happen all at once but it will never happen with your defeatist mentality.
---
This may be worth cancelling my sub. Classic was a trip, but this is just owchy, my dude.
---
Don't be a chode.
---
and the never once paid for drugs....not once!
---
&gt;you want to just give Blizzard more money? 
---
I never said that. I was suggesting those that do give them money at the least make a statement
---
But it gives us a good idea.
---
Lol no one gives a shit, that gm was probably laughing his ass off at you being so mad.

And I use many other websites so don't give me this strawman relativistic bullshit. Part of the reason I am here is to push back on the authoritarian diatribe of people like you. You support a regime that is the largest polluter worldwide, threatens global stability, shoots, indoctrinates, and facilitates slavery and organ harvesting. Any association with this regime is condemnable, including Reddits partial ownership with tencent.
---
Don't be disingenuous, WoW was released later in Europe.
---
&gt; If you somehow think having MC and Onyxia being the only raiding endgame for 8 months is a good idea then it's clear you're far too delusional to reason with.
---
Blackwing Lair came out roughly 8 months after launch in 2004. This is completely reasonable. You have some serious entitlement issues if you're going to whine about that.
---
You being on Reddit and using a smart phone is supporting China.
---
Small servers? Our server is always 'FULL'
---
We kited the neutral innkeeper from silithus straight in front of the aq40 entrance and set our hearthstone there on a German private server - idk how it works on classic.

Or they could stand for freedom. And not bend the knee to Garrosh nations.

I feel dirty for being 55 on my Paladin and already having a 60 hunter.

Truth is I’ve played A LOT.   And I didn’t think I’d get this into the game again but at least I do regularly workout and go to work.  It’s just I don’t have a whole lot to do outside of those things at the current moment.
---
With that being said, I think Dire Maul releasing early is a mistake.
---
Or "invested it" in execs wallets.

after what they pulled with this little 'stunt' I wouldn't put it past them to embezzle the money.

---
500-600 on Whitemane Horde, and I've already committed hours and hours of farming it, so I'm going to see this damn thing through.
---
They can in dungeons, but they're functionally useless in raids so it's pretty rare to find a tank pally at higher levels. For dungeons they're though they're actually better than Warrior since they can manage AoE threat far better.
---
Only thing I'm afraid of is being in the 40-50s range after phase 2 comes out.
---
Might be a guild formed by a few real life friends.
---
Mine is like this, we are either all on or none of us are on typically. But we do our best to engage people who dont want to come hang in discord. Sadly our gchat is always dead because we spend most of our time in discord.
---
Grinders will be the first to quit and might only resub for a month to clear new content.
---
Casuals are going to play for years a little at a time.
---
With a normal game I don't like but understand the need to cater to grinders but classic should be the exception if they want to promote longevity.
---
It's insane that something I spend 1-2 hrs a day doing it considered slow and casual.
---
Stop building this up to be a fight against “totalitarianism.” It’s not.
---
Whatever is required for nature resist gear for AQ and the mats for turn ins for gates probably wouldn’t be a bad investment if you can wait that long for your payoff
---
That's actually exactly how it works. For someone located outside of either server's physical region (i.e. Florida), this is the difference seen between east (central) and west servers from their hosted locations. It is completely negligible. DNS doesn't have anything to do directly with this concept, you're just tossing out buzzwords for no reason.
---
I've always heard that too, but I didn't ever care enough to follow it. Not a huge deal imo.
---
the rule is basically 'offends a portion or group of the public'. China is a big market and A/B wants that money. so they'll shut down anything that is anti-china.
---
blizzard made their post on it. https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23179289

you could disc midflight, relog and land at the next fp.
---
She has a line "Freeze, don't move" that could be cut for just the "Free" part.  Now to find her saying "Hong Kong"
---
&gt; But if you are not OK with it, maybe you should take a stance. 
---
But dont you think that stance has to have any significance to make a difference? How much do you think my single subscription will make an impact VS doing nothing? This is a bad story, but I dont think it'll pick up enough to have any significant amount of people actually cancel their subs.
---
&gt;  I'd like to resist that, even if my resistance is ultimately futile and meaningless.
---
I guess thats maybe the crux of our philosophical differences on it. I do take the admittedly more cynical approach to something like this. If its futile and meaningless, I dont see a point in trying.
---
To make true difference, we need a government-level resistance to these things. You and me wont make much of an impact, unless youre secretly a billionaire.
---
My kind of fun is killing hunters.
---
In vanilla Dire maul was released two weeks after the first 60, right? The week of October 15th does not seem that early.
---
ALT + Tab selects friendly windows.
---
"You will never get MC down to 1 day when your gear gets better/do more dmg/tanks more threat"
---
"Casual guilds die because they can't keep up with content. BTW WHERES MY FUCKIN NEXT RAID THIS PATCH HAS BEEN ON MC FOR LIKE 3 MONTHS AND WERE DONE WTF"
---
You are in complete denial that you dont have to play this game to be the "best" at it or get the best times in raids. In vanilla we got to naxx when we were shittier players with the same mindset. Then you act like im critisizing YOUR guilds for behaving that way when I just dont want you to push your guilds standards on other people you play with and destroy their play-style or understanding of the game. You just can't envision someone who plays this game for fun as an RPG.
---
Yea bro it’s a game. You should be able to enjoy it. Don’t let some shitty people ruin it for you. There’s also plenty of players and guilds out there. So if this guild isn’t the right fit just do you and I’m sure one will eventually fall into your lap. Just run pugs be friendly and you’re likely to make some friends and find your group through that
---
You're gonna be hard pressed to go day-to-day without supporting companies that promote China
---
I'm quitting too, from America.
---
I find I don't even have time to charge + berserk/rage/spin before the fuckers already aoe and pulled half of them off.
---
it's true and alot of people agree. i cheated on my ex which basically ruined her life. it was really, really bad. like, really bad. the type of bad where you think, damn, i really fucked up. not a typical cheating incident. 
---
2 years later she's hitting me up for dick. not proud of it, just proving my point. also, at least 90% of people i know with exes have fucked their exes at some point while being broken up. 
---
the reason for this is obvious. exes used to be together, so they are almost 100% comfortable with each other. they aren't strangers, they didn't just meet recently, so the sex is more familiar, and easier overall. the whole time i was fucking my ex (which ended badly lol) she kept saying how much she liked it because of how easy it is for her due to the comfortability of it.
---
really was not trying to sound like some dickhead in my last comment, but from my experience and those around me irl, it seems like a very common thing.
---
You should send this to blizzard support, I mean it
---
"Take Care"

I'm not okay with what china is doing, but I'm completely okay with blizzard reacting this way.
---
Yeah well you’re wrong
---
I never understood the logic of blaming the hunter pet following the loose mob. The mob would agro the room regardless right??? It’s not like the mob walks in and comes back without pulling. Idk. Just a salty hunter here.
---
I was using Azeroth auto pilot and loved it but it crashed on me today and I cannot get it to resync at all. 
---
Is there anything similar that can provide icons or dots on the map for kills on quests?
---
Disregarding the rules to push politics, ok. Pretty garbage if you ask me.
---
Seriously how do people even go about their normal days with this sort of mentality. I wouldn’t be able to get anything done being outraged all the time..
---
The issue is that Blizzard makes a LOT more money from China.
---
&gt; Ooo, let's write **to** the mods!
---
If a human reads that message they're going to understand what this is about.
---
Does my canceling my subscription make you feel uncomfortable about continuing to support Blizzard?
---
Right, so it's pretty reasonable in this context, but they've now got their name out there with a huge dollar amount next to the statement "NO PUNISHMENT FOR HAVING AN OPINION".
---
What if this guy starts talking about how Cosby did nothing wrong?
---
There are a lot of controversial opinions between "babies are delicious" and "support HK", and I guarantee this company doesn't want to defend the rights of everybody that holds them.
---
Blasted Lands and Thousand Needles weren't very good
---
Woah... can we get a NSFW tag?? We have mages here
---
When layers were still rampant people were making 1000g+ a week. Sorry you didnt get it when the gettin was good
---
I want an addon that displays my rage bar as a separate, big bar in the middle of the screen, anyone know any addons that can accomplish this?
---
Cancelled my sub and gave this as the answer. Continue with the struggle my friend.
---
Thanks, although pointing out that actively telling people you don't care kinda shows you care, is actually a fairly basic concept. I doubt that alone would make me good at making a lawful argument in court.
---
Well, I won't be sticking around to see if it does. Done giving them my money until they're under new management.
---
&gt; too subtle for majority of people
---
A WoW player thinking he's smarter than his peers?! 
---
Yup, it's definitely Classic.
---
All the streamers are 60 and they are getting bored. WoW needs to keep them playing.
---
cool story
---
Yo,
---
Thank you for NOT censoring this topic. This is historic and i am glad the Mods see it for what it is. Some mods on other Activision/Blizz games are not doing this which speaks volumes.
---
Thank you for having the guts to do this.
---
Noticed it also, mostly consistently.
---
Probably because you take pictures of your screen with your phone, thats like -23 luck
---
Subtle hehehehe
---
I've run it from 52-57 and the XP is pretty meh unless you get 60s in your group or other players who really know the dungeon. Drops are aight but for HoJ, I haven't seen it once.
---
Looking back, I would probably just do a quest run (MC Attune Quest, Kill Fineous for Shadowforge Key, Save Gorshak + Princess, kill incendius, Dark Iron quests from Kargath, etc) and then level normally.
---
Princess drops your BIS boots but you need to complete the gorshak + princess quest chain first.
---
&gt;I liked being able to swap specs for the last several years of retail, and since that's a laborious and expensive undertaking in classic, seems like it might be worth it.
---
I mean, leveling a second 60 will probably be a lot more time consuming than whatever time you'd spend grinding gold for switching specs. But if you find it fun, you do you. Personally, I'd prefer to have two different classes, so that you have more overall versatility, but to each their own.
---
Yeah, in hindsight I regret it haha. But my conscience was too guilty in the moment. But trust me, I regret it (especially since he rolled a 22, totally bearable.)
---
Idk man a simple click to do something morally upstanding is a lot less convoluted then making a lifestyle. We shouldn't say that it is disgraceful to act good in an instance, but to not immediately adopt it as a lifestyle. In our highly technical world filled with disinformation and disaster sometimes the best any of us can do on a day to day basis is that first click of making a stand. Yall shouldn't be so harsh to call people hypocrites, and we shouldn't discourage doing something righteous. 
---
Uther would be proud of them.
---
Vanish is learnt at lvl 22, and these mobs are lvl 18-19.
---
Your meme is ruined.
---
It also doesnt put the hunter into combat (although I don't know if it triggers a pvp flag or not).
---
You have a way with words.
---
Solo farming DME can be done at 52 as mage. As holy priest you wanna stack as much INT as possible and you should be able to do the same.
---
But so is LBRS, UBRS, Scholo, Strat, BRD, etc .... yet nobody makes a fuss about those being available, but the only reason they dont is because 'thats the way it was last time'.
---
I had 6 gold at level 41-42.. Just kept playing, kill crap. Level 44, got mount.
---
I think they are focusing on what will make them long term profit, vs short term players.
---
So they are looking at the hardcores who will live and breathe classic for the long term. And they are the ones who are growing short on things to do, and DM gives them another treadmill to run through for a bit before reaching the pvp patch (next 2 months or so).
---
We also need to take into consideration, AQ is a very long period of time. The war effort WILL come back, and depending on servers it may last a very VERY long time. Not to mention the raid tier will last a while the bosses in there aren't exactly easy.
---
And Naxx of course will be another long tier, the hardcores who have been farming it for years (literally), are going to burn through it fast to be the world first or server firsts but the majority of the playerbase never stepped foot in there. I think Blizzard wants more people to have the chance to see it so it stands to reason whatever is next will be delayed for a while.
---
As I said previously as well, there's going to be a mass exodus for 8.3 when it lands, we are already getting parts of the details and people are getting excited, there's going to be a huge amount of the population who will be flocking to that as it will be the new shiny thing.
---
As for rushing 60, there's a huge amount of the playerbase who have been doing it on private servers for 10+ years, they are bored of it. Leveling IS a drag for a huge portion of the playerbase, they want it over with so they can do what they want to do. To stop staring at an XP bar, and enjoy the game.
---
What if I'm fully aware, but just don't care?
---
There is no argument.  Deadmines was released in Vanilla.  Dire Maul was not.  The only people who call Deadmines "VC" are people that started on a server that was created after Dire Maul was released.
---
I hate this post.. I have a 33 warrior, 24 rogue, 19 paladin... and now I wanna mess around on a Druid thanks to this post
---
As for classes, warlock, druid, hunter, paladin.
---
Mage can work and is a reasonable class to use because they can portal everywhere, cutting down on travel times.
---
Warlock is better than mage due to having a tanking pet, but they do lose a bag slot to a soul pouch, they also get their mount free.
---
Druid can bear form or kitty stealth, self heals, low downtime.
---
Hunter also has the benefit of a pet that can tank. Only downside is the need to have arrows, which makes you lose a bag slot to a quiver, arrows have a cost, but you won’t be spending them as much as in a raid or dungeon runs while farming, so a full quiver should last a while.
---
Paladin has a free mount, self heals. And I believe 20% faster mount speed from that passive.
---
Tracer is straight in China
---
Money &gt; everything
---
Disengage only works in melee range...
---
Dude I devot a large majority of my free time to classic, at /played 5days and 20 hours at Lvl 52, idk I play every night for at least 2 hours and most weekends for half of each day, I don't feel like I'm leveling insanely slow, if anything I feel like I'm going fairly quick bar the people putting on Marathons. I hope they drag the content out after this in longer intervals. Nos and Elysiums schedules were great
---
You think you do
---
Thank you bro, i thought that i kind of had to do that in order to discuss a matter like this, because i in my own mind is 100% not a ninja.
---
My comment was in response to someone else's comment about casuals. 
---
Why I'm upset about this decision has nothing to do with the pace I've been playing the game whatsoever.
---
You're the only one arguing here dude.
---
The tauren animations are so bad, I dont know how i didnt realize it until I was well into my 30s.
---
Ah, you’re from the UK, makes a lot more sense.
---
&gt;Virtue Signalling
---
&gt;The action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments intended to demonstrate one's good character or the moral correctness of one's position on a particular issue.
---
The critical bit
---
&gt;intended to demonstrate one's good character
---
Meaning the purpose of the signal must be to look good, not to hold a discussion. I get that you don't like this, but maybe learn the words you use before you use them.
---
I paid for a ton of months in advance, I feel like it wont make a difference to them when it wasn't gonna auto renew anytime soon
---
FUCK CCP
---
Honestly having 8 slot bags may be hurting you. Never underestimate the passive income from just selling the junk you pickup.
---
so... Where did I contradict myself? Cmon, you cant cocktease like that and then dont give me a good laugh.
---
The census data is garbage. I have a character of every class at 5 sitting in inns getting rested XP. So does a ton of other people. The data is corrupt and useless. It is outdated and garbage. It does not represent fucking anything.
---
DM is largely irrelevant content for me. I’m perfectly fine with clearing MC in one night and doing it again next week along with Onyxia as we have a lot of fury warriors and there’s a lot of competition for loot.
---
I could care less about this update or when it comes.
---
Fact is that this content release does not negatively impact your ability to enjoy the game AT FUCKING ALL.
---
Thanks for your co-operation.
---
Seriously, it's just a video game. If you cannot deprive yourself of a game in support of your morality, what can you do? Easiest boycott of my life. I'm interested to see how Blizzard addresses the backlash, but China's market is undeniable so I'm not getting my hopes up.
---
You think you don't
---
I'm not complaining, just making an observation that the community on this sub is not representative of the the community at large. Calm down.
---
&gt;When will folks realize we play and watch these games to get away from the troubles of the world, not have it follow us.
---
We talking about a gamer. One that got banned for saying something on an interview.  While the interview itself may have been slightly related to the game, he didn't get banned for playing illegally.
---
The game company decided to ban him and take away his ability to "get away from the troubles of the world" as you put it.
---
How can you say that quote above, and not be outraged that this kid was banned for something OUTSIDE THE GAME.  I hope someone catches you saying something dumb outside the game and bans you, cuz that would be funny as fuck.
---
&gt;It's like that 49ers guy who was kneeling during the anthem. Like, we're not watching you for your political stances or ideological causes; we want to watch the damn game.
---
Him kneeling didn't impact the game. That's dumb to say.  Anyone that was upset over him kneeling during a song is a snowflake.
---
Made sense to me dude!
---
In terms of EQ: Project 1999 green (fresh classic server) is releasing on 10/25. Just in case you're interested.
---
Second this
---
The ironic thing is that this happened because of a rule that they can fire anyone that makes them look bad. The irony. **The irony.**
---
Yeah, nah. I'll be the asshole, I genuinely don't care.
---
Government regulations on corporate entities is exactly what caused this controversy. Why would the US government do any better than China, once you give them the power?
---
&gt;I am never again in my life going to have the time or motivation to sort through my inventory, bank alts, and full guild bank
---
I'm relating to this so much. Used a sesame, went to the bank to get my inventory back. Now I understand why they reset it.
---
&gt;Stormwind, Ironforge, and every original-continent zone I checked are completely empty
---
Even in wotlk it wasn't that empty, geez.
---
I cancelled, secretly hoping they reverse this decision.  I really like the Blizzard ecosystem of games. But when you put money before freedom I have a problem with that.
---
Weird heads up: I don’t see your post gilded or silvered, despite your edit. Also, I am unable to gift you anything either. I wonder why.
---
Thats the problem and why we dont want it.  It fills in these gear gaps and other shit to make the progression easier.  Id PLEASE like a crack at the current content with the coddling.  I played through vanilla once, and thats why I'd like to do again.  FUck
---
When you do this, make sure you bring the mob to the tank's vicinity.  I actually like it if people do this for pats and so on.  I'm always looking for adds anyway.  If we can add another mob to the chaos and get away with it, why not?
---
All the treants wear a chain. So hip, those logs! :)
---
Skip the stuff you don't really need.
---
Don't buy the mount or the t-shirt.
---
Skip watching blizzcon especially the livestreams especially the Hearthstone panel. You'll still get the news.
---
You can keep playing and still send a statement.
---
Deactivated my acc.
---
ITT: people having been playing for 15 years without reading the keybinds.
---
Likely auto-filters or chat banned.
---
There you go again, trying to make your original complaint about the economy.  That's not what it was.  It was you got slapped in the face personally by Blizzard because they didn't tell you far enough ahead of time that they were adding content.
---
No one gives a shit how you decide to play.  Play slow, play fast, no one cares.
---
Depends on the healer.  Paladins, for example, rarely have to downrank, as they typically just switch between their two healing spells based on the situations.
---
Emoting with hordies is still plenty fun for me
---
In vanilla I seriously ended up knowing more hordies than allies
---
I walked to dun morogh exactly at level 10 to tame a snow leopard on my troll hunter. 
---
Got a warlock summon to arathi highlands, corpse ran south through wetlands, followed the coast to the dun morogh glitch spot, drowned in that spot and res’d right next to one practically :) 
---
Was the best feeling ever and only got one compliment on my snow baby the entire time I leveled in the Barrens. Now I’m level 25 and it’s not such a big deal... rip
---
Man that's too close to home. Except I have a AIO cooled RTX 2080 and 32gb ram.. 
---
Does let me play a few games at the same time though, so that's fun.
---
Blizzard has been a Chinese Cumpony since they made the call to make their next big game "mobile" a clear sign they plan to target china the leader in mobile app spending.
---
Yah bro coke ain't worth it tbh. If you smoking good gas it should get you numb enough anyway.
---
There is no escape. Anything you do will pale in comparison. Its like trying to scrath an itch through a thick leather coat. Like trying to reach clean water when there is a layer of film resting on top. You're an addict. You will never not be an addict. Im sorry.
---
You aren't behind. Play what you like. If that means taking a break from the Rogue to get in some Shaman action then do it.
---
There are slow spots for everyone and every class.
---
That’s why I actually Dual Wield  and Stance dance from Battle to Berserker in PvE
---
I was starting to get alittle annoyed when I would wait for 3.6 seconds, *Miss followed by the missing sound*,  then wait another 3.6 to finally hit a mob while they already hit me like 12 times
---
Kill it for Magic Dust drops.
---
what tf is that
---
i wasnt really paying attention (at 1st) but i am pretty sure 100% of mobs with an E'ko can not be skinned
---
Cause you support an idiot and make shit posts about that idiot like its going out of style.  You must still be in middle school.  God help us if this is our future.
---
I just cancelled my ongoing classic WoW subscription for this reason. It's a shame as I was having alot of fun with it.
---
Gotcha. Thank you.
---
Oh yeah, there was a lot of that. There were also a lot of people who expected to stroll into MC in greens and get carried by us, despite the fact that we spent 2 weeks getting our raiders into 90% pre raid bis gear, which was a big part of why we got 9/10 so quick. The guild officers, not even 60 yet, had plans to separate our 40 man into 2 20 mans and fill the rest with fresh 60s. Not to mention this was a zerg guild and had tons of random baddies in it. Quite a few toxic players as well. We just wanted to have autonomy over our own raid group, and not have our name tarnished by those toxic people, you know? I get it though, they liked that they were on the team, even if they had no part in the actual success.  
---
Personally, I wanted to split a lot sooner - in our 40s when we were already 20 levels ahead of the less hardcore pack. But people were dragging their feet, you know how it is. Too scared to move on.

Dark Iron Ore, is only in dungeons. and nobody ever rolls for those if they don't have mining.
---
I don't think our server has that issue I had to run from far too many devilsaurs leveling in ungoro.
---
I’m an undead priest level 49. I’ve been focusing on grinding and questing since SM and haven’t hit any dungeons. My gear has felt a little bit lacking as it’s mostly all greens. Are there any must have items at this level or should I wait until my mid 50s and go for pre BiS items?
---
Also since 46 the game seems to be more Grinding than chaining quests in the same zones. Are there quests that are must do, or is grinding the most efficient way to level? I can consistently pull 25-30k an hour not sure if this is on the low end or not.
---
I emote with alliance all the time.
---
Watch me playin WoW now to support Blizzard and Xi Jinping
---
Still amongst the worst solo levelers in the game. Possibly THE worst.
---
Evidently it's absolutely doable but RNG deaths suck and Warriors don't have and self heals or escape tools.
---
&gt; Why I'm upset about this decision has nothing to do with the pace I've been playing the game whatsoever.
---
Then why did you bring it up in the same breath?
---
Nogger Stole My Bike (Noggenfogger EU)
---
Cancelled sub, Deleted all Blizz games and BNET, Shame on Blizzard.
---
I’m visiting from /r/all, and wanna know what sort of spell you guys had to cast to get mods like this.
---
How much did they cost?
---
I like the fact that they dontt spin in every skill but appart from thay they move kinda ridicoulous.
---
&gt; Also warrior tanking in classic seems overall way harder for me than any other tank in retail. A lot or stance dancing, target swaping etc.
---
It's overwhelmingly more tedious, that's for sure. Deep prot warriors are also punished in classic if they want to go out and farm or do whatever solo as they'll either have to respec (only to respec back to deep prot later on) or do everything dog ass slow. In retail even if you never switch out of your tank spec you can solo just fine.
---
Not to make the issue worse but also there are no Druids. It’s the best part. All tier goes to you. Nobody knows how to fight you in pvp. People flip out in thank yous if you innervate them. I’m really happy there’s such a bad stigma around Druid lol
---
Naw, I'm 2 expansions behind, so I've missed the rush into the new territories, so I don't even know how to get started in them.
---
There's some new city out there next to all the highest level cloth/leather/mining grinding zones and I just haven't reached it yet.
---
Beast Master is good for leveling, respeccing to Marksman at/around 55 in order to learn the spec for endgame content is what I plan on doing.
---
Thanks, I'll take a look at tribal. 
---
Other profession on this char is skinning. I've got skinning/herb on my main for money making, with this alt figured I'd try to do a crafting profession while I leveled - hasn't been too expensive with skins coming in from two toons.
---
Then you don't feel for them, lmao. Empty words bucko.
---
"I feel for you but I will not do the smallest thing I can in support of you" Yikes.
---
Alright I literally just got a Fiery War Axe from a random demon in Desolace, I'm a 37 warrior and I still don't have my WW axe.
---
Right now idk if I should try to sell it on the AH or just use it myself, how does it stack up against the WW axe? Also, there aren't any other Fiery War Axes posted on my realm's AH so I don't really know how much it could even sell for.  
---
Look at all the virtue signaling and lack of actual conversation of how a neutrally affiliated company should handle someone using their platform as a speakbox.
---
I'm sorry but time investment in a video game /= lives/freedom/illegal incarceration, beatings, murders, islamic concentration camps etc.
---
get your priorities stragitht.  Blizzard should pull the plug in China themselves.  It's a disgrace.
---
While i was amazed by the scenery of legion landscapes i was so shocked by the emptyness of stormwind...
---
Noggenfogger at least stays, so that when you leave animal form you go back to skeleton.
---
Your wallet contributes so extremely little to blizzard. That's why this won't change anything. Most people, the vast majority, won't unsubscribe for this so it's just a personal statement you do for yourself. It's like some people boycotting nestle because they're assholes to people in third world countries. I avoid them myself. Does it make a difference? Well, is Nestlé still one of the biggest companies around?
---
The reason things never change is because people in general don't do enough. That includes you. The people of Hong Kong are rioting in the streets. That makes shit happen. A few hundred people unsubscribing to a game does not.
---
Then again, my boycott of Nestlé doesn't do shit either so don't get me wrong. I understand why you do it and I'm not shitting on the intention. It's just that you're likely suffering a lot more from not being able to play classic (a little) than blizzard, or even more so China, suffers from it (not at all).
---
DM and "ph2" orifinally released 2 months into vanilla.
---
And BWL? 4 months after release.
---
Those of you thinking that you'd get 6 months per phase were pretty confusing. Prepare for world bosses and honor after Halloween, and seeing BWL geared folks after you're done celebrating Christmas.
---
Just like in vanilla.
---
This was back in the day. But yeah that's definitely my philosophy.
---
Activision.
---
Blizzard was fine, and the passion/people from Blizzard did what they could after Activision acquired them. A decade ago I would blindly buy anything from Blizzard, they had that level of trust.
---
Activision was the death knell to Blizzard. Its amazing how far they've fallen over the past decade.

As a 48 resto shaman I do not downrank I probably should though.... if anything I’m drinking with the other casters. I’m at +126 healing
---
No it is more consistent and isn't kind of hit or miss type of thing.
---
yes. the mainstream media has puff pieces on China and hit pieces on our western countries week after week.
---
The Chinese government is the shadiest version of all the thing i can tell that you fear.
---
or be like me where people just open trade and stick there box in, then walk away after its picked with not even a thank you
---
Don't sweat it. If it makes you happy, and its not hurting you or others around you, it just means you are having a good time. Enjoy have a good time, because people don't always have that.
---
Thank you very much.
---
We already melee Shazzrah. He dies before he blinks once.
---
It is *already* coddled.  1.12 is a HUGE difference between where we would be if we were adhering to a truly 'vanilla' timeline.
---
It is already much easier and DM does not change that by very much.
---
Please,  some of you that hold this opinion that DM is somehow going to destroy your progression through MC (which does not in any form require *current* prebis)  Elaborate on which items you think are substantially adding to the current power in the game.  I can think of only 1, Quel'Serrar.   Aside from this the additional power from the gear that DM adds does not create a *substantial* difference in power that will make MC significantly easier than it already is.   Which is VERY EASY.
---
Lmao, bro nobody is going to take shit that you say seriously if you say such extremist nonsense.
---
Because china doesn't give a flying fuck what the rest of the world thinks, it's about controlling their own population to an insane degree.
---
That only works if they dont then get food stuffs from other countries which they currently are. They now get most of their soy for example from Brazil. That's why we need a competent leader not a raging narcissist. A smart leader could have gotten global sanctions on china or at least sanctions from our allies.
---
What humans rights violation?
---
From what I read main tanking in places like aq and naxx main tank is fury/prot is the only way to hold threat on a lot of the bosses effectively. Else your dps stands around scratching their ashes waiting for Sunders to STILL pull off the tank very easily when they start using abilities like sinister strike and not just auto attacks
---
A very large portion of the profit (if there is any) is from the tickets that were already paid for and can’t be refunded. 
---
Why not show up to something you already paid for and protest?
---
I’ve been playing wow since two weeks after it released in 2004. I cancelled two subscriptions right after hearing this news. Blizzard can suck my fucking dick.
---
Cancelled my sub. Keep fighting, you have millions of people behind you around the world.
---
That would be a complete disaster. Good luck getting 50-60 when bored raiders have nothing better to do than farm your ass for HKs. Honor system needs to wait until more people are 60.
---
Thanks for clarifying things.
---
Spy
---
Competitors at games using that platform to promote justice and human rights has a long history. People have a natural right to speak out. Supporting shitty practices just because lots of other places have shitty practices is a garbage argument.
---
To piggyback on this, mages should be using a sheep macro that marks your sheep target the instant you start casting sheep.  Something like this:
---
    #showtooltip polymorph
---
    /stopcasting
---
    /tm 4
---
    /cast Polymorph
---
This will stop casting whatever you're casting without having to jump/move, mark your target with "Moon", and then cast sheep all with one keypress.  
---
(I'm pretty sure that's what my macro is, I'm at work so I can't check)
---
they hold a generally higher value. this is the only thing that is actually really valuable for a skinner, so why shouldnt it only be for skinners. :))
---
Instead of cancelling your sub, call your bank and do something called a charge back.  Let your big-bank wage war against a big-chicomm owned company.  Yeah sure youll get your whole bnet acct banned for doing so.  But think about it, blizzard has already spent the money on the sub-plan you paid for, using it to forecast budgets for next quarter, has already paid their employees and lined their execs coffers with even more stock options.
---
Charge backs are where its at, call your bank and get them to remove the charge from your bank account.  Be RETRO-active too.
---
I'm leaning more towards lock. The gameplay I enjoy more I just feel more safe? Like not afraid of what's close to me or to aggro things cause i can down about anything.
---
You know what they say about guys with big action bars....
---
No, it's perfectly fine to boycott them if you don't agree with their decisions and beliefs. Some of the things people are saying about the company is pretty harsh, though, and immediately acting as if they are under Chinese control/influence (may or may not be true, IDK) is an overreaction. Even acting as if Blizzard is compliant with the injustices and tyranny in China is pretty extreme. All they are saying is "don't use us to further your own political agenda, no matter the agenda." There could be more to it, but with just this one event is hardly enough to picture head honchos of Blizzard sitting in a board room with the Chinese government discussing how to continue to take advantage of their citizens and suppress their rights. 
---
Boycott Blizzard if you think they should have backed him up. Boycott the NFL for how they treated Kapp and the BLM movement. Boycott Chic-fil-a over gay rights. Boycott whoever and whatever you want for whatever reason you want, but be reasonable about why the companies are doing what they are doing. 
---
The title of the post straight up says the reason Blizz banned the player was for standing up for rights, and *that is categorically incorrect*. That is all I take exception to. Blizzard would not have done this if he stood up for Hong Kong in any other way.
---
4 stack Reckoning bomb full builds
---
IF that were to happen,  the outrage would only intensify.   People would call them out for being hippocrats and selectively enforcing their own rules when it fits the Chinese narrative.  Also that explanation wouldn't make any sense unless they undid the other guy's punishment.
---
I like how you latch on to hate speech despite the fact that the first thing he said was to be civil. You must get called out on that a lot. And judging by your responses in this thread, I'd have to guess you're a real gamer, complete with the white robes/hat and pimply fat round face....
---
When people gank someone then complain about retribution lol. Although I do agree that an hour is super excessive.
---
Amen brother
---
You are a good person.
---
So releasing DM and it's catch up gear ahead of honor is actually a good move then.
---
Yet nobody will stop playing Blizzard games or giving them money in the West
---
Buncha cowardly fucking apathetic fucks
---
you can tell by their eyes.
---
I think you answered your own question - it needs a competent Hunter, there might not be many of those yet.
---
35-40 and 45-48 are the dry spots for quests and standard leveling. Push through those with dungeons and mount farming
---
I'm in training but yeah it's magic.
---
DM should have been out on launch.
---
yep nailed it
---
I’ve been playing almost every day since release and I have 35 warrior and a 27 mage. With a whopping grand total of 20G between the two of them. However. All professions are caught up, most of them beyond where they should be for my level. And it is to be noted that I have a long term girlfriend who loves attention and due to work, I only generally am allowed about 3 hours every day to play. And that’s at a maximum.
---
What folks don't know is that China being a Communist State, has stake in ALL businesses in China. Profits from Chinese based companies  gets funneled back into the state. So when Tencent invests in say, a game publisher, some of those profits will go back to China. Tencent has it's hands in a shitload things, not all of them AAA publishers either. I can think of five indies that Tencent invested in.
---
Thanks, I'm aware of the itemization issue. As I said already, it is precisely the itemization, and not Dire Maul, that is responsible for helping certain specs. Try reading my original comment again...
---
Because there wouldn't be a foreign government threatening their profits over it.
---
You’re right it’s a fucked situation because companies are just trying to make money, the devs are trying to make their game fun and appealing. I don’t think a lawsuit solves anything but some of these kids really do need professional help
---
Paladins lost their anti-demon kit just as the legion invaded.
---
That was epic retardation. In the literal sense of the word, as in to be held back.
---
Because of the formatting + my brain transposing words, I read "As a Hong Kong warrior." I salute you man, and so many of us in the US are rooting for you (and wanting to do more).
---
See you next week buddy
---
Huh?
---
This is how it goes in all online games, I have lost count of the number of times someone in LoL typed "muted", but then responded and got angry  about something you said in chat later. Wait bro I thought you muted me?
---
&gt; On top of that, on PVP servers 50+ zones are going to become absolute bloodbaths 
---
Not taking a side here, but to play devils advocate, giving level 60s something to occupy their time other than sandbox pvp might actually make it less of a problem. Whats important is the date of phase 2, not dire maul.
---
Me either.
---
Explain
---
Right....Companies and their shareholders (who invest hundreds of millions of dollars, or more depending on the size of the company) should just lose all that money because "China bad". And Chinese citizens should not have access to those products because of your same limited business insight. Got it. Let me know when that plan comes to fruition.
---
When the public is grossly misinformed
---
(To be clear, that is NOT the case here)
---
Omg ur so right ur like a freedom fighter :D
---
I'm sure Mr Chung will appreciate knowing that a westerner cancelled his WoW sub as he's getting rubber bulleted
---
deleting all my blizzard games when I get home, solidarity
---
&gt; A super casual plays a couple times a week and is just hitting 40 around now. 
---
I don't even have time to play every week. I'm lucky if I get an hour in one sitting. Subbed a week after launch and I just hit 16 last week. Haven't had a chance to play since then.
---
They really are just one developer that barely puts out content anymore. There’s an entire industry of people willing to not succumb to this kinda crap.
---
It's a slippery slope argument, releasing content  so soon is worrying. They're worried that if they keep content coming at this pace, it will be over and done with before they even get the chance to experience it, by the time we get to 60 and are ready to raid, naxx could be out (that's the extreme example) which causes players like him and me to try and rush and cram in more levels and not take the time to enjoy the game or just demotivates us to the point we give up completely, which VERY MUCH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO ENJOY THE GAME.
---
What are puff pieces?
---
Like I said I have no idea how the Chinese Government operate; probably not much better than the rest of the world ;p
---
You fishing upvotes? This has been posted here 100 times, i bet you have seen that.
---
How do I apply to shill?
---
I just canceled my sub. I hate China way more than i love Azeroth. Way to fucking go, blizzard.
---
On another note, f u alliance scum 🤣
---
Do people play Archage? Serious question. I was under the impression that it's a grindfest pay to win game.
---
It would be more or less. I told the other hunter he could have Rok so I could get my pick on gear. We have two other hunters that are alts but are also pretty good players.
---
You really shouldnt downrank when you are lower level. The reason downranking becomes better is the because the +healing gear give the same bonus on lower level spells, so they become more mana effecient. without a decent amount of +healing, the higher ranking spell will be more mana efficient, you just have to use it when the target is at lower health.
---
Most people on average know what threat is and how you can pull it, they just don't care.  It's not as much a big deal in early dungeons but it can be.  It's pretty difficult to hold aggro off a shadow priest who starts DPSing on pull with mindblast and they know this, it's written in the tool tip of the spell, they just seem to not care, so I guess it's within our duty to adjust and spam taunt the first mob of the pull.  Holding aggro on AoE farm isn't nearly as hard as it is holding during an idgaf nuke from all 3 of the group's DPS.  I've gotten 0 complaints from people who pull aggro, they aren't oblivious.  If you are then maybe that is a difference in alliance &lt; horde
---
isn't that only retail? You can get a mod though for classic.
---
Took me a few comments before I got it.
---
Druids have a number of bugs, and have been posting in the forms and reporting in game for weeks
---
Blizzard still hasn't acknowledged any of them.
---
Your point about Blitzchung using Blizzard's platform in a way that they don't intend is certainly valid, and as you say, rational.  Blizzard's reaction to this incident is, however, not one I can agree with.  Their punishment of the player and casters is not a neutral position, it's one that projects the message of China's censorship and oppression, at least in my opinion.
---
As WoW subscribers, our $15/mo is so insignificant to the grand scheme of Blizzard's/China's income that my cancellation is largely symbolic.  However, it's a proportional response to what I consider an intolerable stance from a company that I otherwise like.
---
&gt;I run adblock and have never paid money in to reddit. 
---
Reddit engagement increases its value.
---
Big clicker??
---
They collect it in a sticky so it can't go on r/all, and after a day they will remove the sticky and ban everyone who discusses it elsewhere The mods are Chinese bots.
---
No they don't.
---
[2 instances of nova not being immune while under the effect of Ice Reflector](https://youtu.be/3ET2GoOfr10)
---
I get your concern, but I think people will still be playing the other dungeons. 
---
On EU, the Dire Maul patch was released at the same time as US, even though EU WoW released months later, it's actually a very similar situation/timeframe to how this is being released now.
---
I didn't have an issue finding dungeons, mind you, unlike now when I've been 60 for weeks, I was SLOW then too. I leveled an alt to 60 probably about as slow and even then I didn't have trouble. 
---
Now I get that populations will be smaller now, but really, I don't think people won't do stuff like Strat or UBRS anymore, it should be fine. 
---
LBRS can go die in a fire though. Whatever you think you need in there, it's probably not worth it.
---
You’re not. Uninstalled all their games and app, unsubbed. Done.
---
And then some people are like me really taking their time... With a 39 Druid, 33 Warrior and 26 Mage all working up at once.
---
I feel like this cant be true pre 40, as warriors literally do not have a good damage ability besides overpower, but I think after 40, when warriors also have mortal strike/bloodthirst/whirlwind this becomes true.
---
i dont understand why people are so upset about dire maul coming out early. its not that big of a deal. not worth "cancelling your sub and sending a message". just play the game and chill out
---
You realize the catch up gear point doesn't really hold up to much, because we are on the 1.12 patch to begin with, where the itemization was improved tons. Before, spell damage and healing gear was almost non existant outside of MC. A big reason why MC and ony are so easy is because we are using a billion times more optimized gear than back then.
---
Casters had only int, stam, and spirit back when we progressed MC. Now everyone is loaded with more +dmg and +healing than you could get in a year back then. In a few weeks. My priest with 0 raid drops has +550 healing.
---
Depends on the class, gear, and level, and the healing style of the healer.
---
You can read a million guides, get a million answers, eventually you have to figure out what works for your class + spec + gear + Healing role your fulfilling + your personal healing style.
---
**For a class example**, I'll use druids. most druids never down rank regrowth, or Rejuv, buy usually have at least rank 4 + Max rank healing touch on the bar.  However there is a certain High balance spec where they use low rank spells to fish for clear casting.
---
**For Healing style example**
---
Other healers prefer to let tanks go a little lower while cancel casting a big Heal. (keep canceling and recasting until it's full value is needed) to exploit 5 second mana rule.
---
Other healers get really nevrvous when anyone has taken any damage and will pick the right size heal to fill them up. These healers typiccally go through water faster than a california lawn in the arizona desert.
---
**for gear and level examples.**
---
When you are max level and have massive levels of + heal gear, then Down ranking can really shine.
---
When you are low level and Have a huge mana pool but no +healing, casting bigger heals less often works better.
---
I wonder if some people fantasize about being apart of some big social movement. Like they just hope some hot button issue crops up that they can get in on, and they hope it turns into a big deal and they defeat the man so that someday they can tell their grandkids "I was apart of that. We really changed the world"   
---
What drives people to she'd their tears onto the fire like this? Why not sit back and watch it all go to hell?
---
For PVE, hitting mobs, raiding yadda yadda, it's true but for PVP it doesn't matter. you could have 5/300 in axes and it won't matter when hitting another player. Just didn't want you to get your hopes up for the orc axe racial for your pvp enh shammy.
---
as a warr, whenever rogues pop evasion i’m dead. if you’re a rogue pop evasion THE MINUTE you get into a fight with a warrior. he’ll be dead before the buff expires

Not at all.
---
My comment about a slap in the face wasn't about ME being slapped in the face. It was directed at the entire playerbase.
---
You're missing the entire point, so how about I spell it out for you like a child.
---
The slap in the face is that Blizzard had a structured release of phases and is now, with extremely limited notice, changing that structure and going against their original plan, even when they gave a reason in the past why DM was going to be in Phase 2 and not Phase 1.
---
No, but I appreciate you politely letting me know.
---
it’s a game, dude, not a restaurant in the 1960s
---

---

---
WTF
---
The only people complaining are the ones who would never have been 60 before dm came out late this year anyway thats my point grow a brain please.
---
What does that shit on their jerseys even say? I've never understood why they made this change.
---
Dude nobody cares...go watch the latest episode of south park and you'll understand why they did what they did.
---
legit requested a refund for the blizcon ticket and am heavily thinking about unsubbing. Everyone else should too. Let them make phone games.
---
It's there for me in classic default UI. Stopwatch or Alarm options.
---
Gehennas has the most streamers out of the eu servers but there are queues for sure. It starts about 4pm CEST on week days and after that it's kinda bad. I logged in at 5:15 today, and had 2 hour queue.
---
Join us brother!
---
The top 10% of players have mostly only run 2-3 MC. They are not even slightly decked out in gear unless they're a streamer demanding all their class loot.
---
Needing a 1-2 bosses instead of 3-4 absolutely devalues other content. BRD in particular gets pushed out heavily compared to other dungeons.
---
10% ownership is a seat at the Executive table with STRONG shareholder's rights. You know that right? You couldn't even FIRE someone that owns 10% of your company's rights.
---
Yeah that kinda crazy that blizzard would suck Chinas dick like that.
---
how do they work? I'd be interested in setting something up
---
Most groups won't care. Finding 40 bodies to fill slots is always an issue, and these first raids aren't hard enough to require people to be in their pre-raid BiS. Mostly, pre-raid BiS is something to do between raids, imo.
---
F keys, or at least F1-4, are no problem for me. What I don't understand is how people use the Alt modifier. It's like right under your palm.

Recruiting all players, we are expecting to be doing raids for those eligible. Just mainly looking to fill the guild up with fun people to hang out with or dungeon farm with and to have a good time. We are willing to help out new players as we do have experience playing Classic WoW. No requirements to join other than you play the game when possible.
---
If you'd like to join just reply to this or DM me your in-game name and we'll be happy to invite :).
---
I'm having a good time on Stonespine. No queues even at peak hours, but population is high enough that it's easy to get groups.
---
"mega rushes" lmao. DM is coming out 6 weeks after launch instead of 12, seems about right when people are progressing through content at a much faster rate because it's nerfed content with buffed characters wearing buffed gear. Did you expect each patch to take the same amount of time it did in 2004? I came into classic expecting a phase every 2 months.
---
Hunters scale awfully, so it makes sense his damage isn't increased much by gear.
---
I have been loving it for dungeons. We are really a lot better then warriors until they get t2 gear and up so it's fun to play. You can use a lot of your tools and having br and innervate let's you win fights that should have been a wipe. You are mostly just mashing maul and swipe most of the time but I am fine with that.
---
I don't mind the pacing, just the rationale behind it. They might as well release all of phase 2 with Dire Maul, otherwise the official phase 2 will be super lackluster.
---
Faster is better. So we get TBC, the peak of WoW gaming.
---
Yeah this is meaningless without screenshots. Between the two possibilities 1: Blizzard didn't take away layers 2: you misunderstood something and have come to a wrong conclusion about layers: I know which I'll put my money on.
---
I haven't logged on today, heard about the Server tabs but not the removal of the flight button. Bummer.
---
The servers weren't listed by timezone when Vanilla released, so they kept it the same for Classic. Don't remember when/ if they added the tabs in Vanilla.
---
You never noticed the clock on your minimap was 3 hours ahead?It doesn't change much. Lots of people playing on servers outside their timezone. Depending on your situation, it can actually be beneficial. You don't have to stay up as late for raids, and when you are up late there is less competition for stuff. The opposite is also true, though.
---
fury/prot shield is viable now in lvling gear.   Fury/prot/DW-2H is Endgame gear level shit.
---
"X # of people unsubscribe from WoW in wake of Hong Kong controversy" 
---
Sounds like a good headline to me.
---
&gt;Do you think Blizzard wanted this guy to hijack their gaming tournament to spread his ideological views?
---
Dumbest thing I'll hear today.
---
Screw your apathy and ignorance.
---
&gt; I personally am not even level 40
---
I stopped reading there.
---
You are not the audience Blizzard should be catering to. You are a casual who won't even be affected by any further release in classic because you simply do not play enough to be affected by it.
---
If that's what you need to say to make yourself feel better then go ahead my dude.
---
But its not as if bear's aren't viable, it just that wars become better. Your complaint just seems the be they get better stuff, and thus are stronger overall, but there's always going to be stronger classes, and MC was gonna come out in ph2 regardless. So you are just arguing that now, newer prot tanks can get BiS gear much easier than a druid who may have played longer
---
"Dear game, evasion rogues are OP, please nerf. Warlocks are ok."  
---
\- Warriors.
---
Yea, I'm actually a single dude, but I work about 50 hours a week and go to school 4 out of 7 days for 5 hours a night. I managed to hit 50 just last night, and that's me playing religiously every fuckin moment I can scrounge up to play.. I've lost some sleep even, which is definitely bad.. I'm not in a hurry but I absolutely love the game so I'm enjoying all my time I get to play it. But seeing the release of the content this quickly does worry me a bit but maybe I should consider making a casual guild with people with wonky schedules and commit to doing every raid regardless of better shit coming out. The current guild I'm in now has already done 2 MC runs.
---
This is why i have saved nearly all of my cloth. Only 400 stacks and Im good to go. I cannot wait for DM. Im going to solo farm for ever.
---
It means when I hit 60, every guild will be DM only.
---
Blackrock Mountain should just be cut from the game.
---
Sure would be if Blizz still released sub numbers.
---
I don't mind gold inflation - makes it easier to get your mount/epic mount for alts and that amount never changes
---
Fuck it why not
---
You can log out and have someone else reset the instance, it will send you back to the start.
---
Who's a druid?
---
&gt;The bigger issue with Dire Maul is the increased efficiency for gold farming with lasher packs and guaranteed Rich Thorium Veins. Gold inflation is not something we need, especially barely a month after launch.
---
As a counterbalance, however, the reduction in layering I'm seeing  has reduced inflation.  Black lotus on Blameuax were going for 30g a pop and when they reduced the server to 2 layers they've now bumped up to 40g.
---
What do people think is going to happen to the economy?  The rate of gold being created in the economy won't change much.  The rate of mats farmable in DM will skyrocket and the price will plummet.  This makes them more accessible for the average player.   Ton's of gold is still leaving the economy due to people buying epic mounts.   The biggest difference here from vanilla is that more people are aware of these farming methods but again that leads to an increase in supply and not necessarily any change to the amount of gold being added to the economy.  Its just moving around,  and potentially faster due to the lower cost.
---
Anyone who plays less than me is a casual, and anyone who plays more than me is a neckbeard tryhard. So it has always been, so it will always be.  Stop worrying about what other people are doing.
---
Good word play - def took me a second read to get it.
---
8/10
---
IIRC it wasn't until Naxx that our guild stopped doing MC ... so its possible that there will be a time it becomes relatively obsolete, but we're talking roughly 1.5 years away. And when we stopped MC our guild was the top pve guild, there were still plenty of other guilds doing it until TBC dropped.
---
Subscription should be cheaper if you VPN through China, but I think there is a four human rights violations minimum to purchase? Can anyone confirm I haven't been collecting my organs lately...
---
It is. That's why I went with Astellia and wow Classic instead.
---
Considering whats just happened... Looks like ill be staying with Astellia only.

---
I could be reaching here, but i think it has to do with the fact that there was a dog on Rick and Morty, and eventually he and other dogs take over the humans and treat them as their pets. He (the dog) also reveals he doesn't like the name "Snuffles" and plans to go by "Snowball" now. Something something China/Hong Kong, and now the name Snowball is banned because Blizzard doesn't want to China to be mad at them.
---
You mean shared by 4 people and your tank does not need any. Like cmon!
---
My guild is doing a trash clear of MC tonight to prep for the raid next Tuesday. I’m a lvl 57 lock, I want to join because I did a previous trash run and a felheart item dropped.
---
Is it worth it to join the trash clear tonight, or should I push and try to hit 60 before the full clear next week?
---
Something amazing launching that might pull people away for a week? Better unleash some content!

That's what everyone is doing in classic anyways...Dungeon grinding provides good amounts of xp, gold and gear. Questing can be boring, lonesome and you are vulnerable to ganking.

You’re making me jealous I just got my Rogue to 51 and settled in that I was gonna stick it out and now you gave me this to think about. Rude.

Damn that's a nice drop gz mate

---
They didn't change the servers locations. You picked US east from the start, and all the info was available on the wow website. They simply added it in-game
---
This is most likely due to streamers playing 24/7 and running out of c ontent to show off on their streams. This is a very important factor that didn't exist 15 years ago.

That's like saying "you can't be perfect, so don't even try to be good" or "you can't clear all the trash in the world, so why bother with cleaning up your own".
---
Doing even something small right is always better than doing nothing.
---
You are the hero we deserve. Love it.
---
Gonna cancle my subscription to wow over this. Fuck China, fuck the rockets, and fuck blizzard. This is a humanitarian issue and these mother fucking companys are blatantly picking corporate greed over the life of these people. Money in their pockets is greater than your life.
---
Most likely. I know it's neigh impossible, but you gotta start somewhere.
---
Fuck blizzard and Activision. Spineless fucks.
---
If it truly bothers you, then I would consider looking into the actions of any companies that you patronize, as well as their parent companies. The fact is almost any company you find will do something that you disagree with or support a cause that you don't. Once you've identified those companies who have different beliefs/ideologies than you, then you can stop giving them your support. 
---
You'll find at that point the only companies you can patronize are small businesses, since they're so rarely called upon to take a political stance. Any large company will happily compromise their morals in order to please the crowd. I'd also like to point out that their stances will conveniently change whenever it suits them. 20-30 years ago almost no company would dare take a stand to support same-sex marriage. Now that there's a  mainstream push supporting it, with a large amount of public opinion backing it, companies are popping up all over the place to support it. Do you think they just magically changed their mind? No, it was simply a matter of economics. This is precisely the same.
---
But streaming also helps keep people interested in the game and keep the player count high.  You know, so you actually have someone to run scarlet monastery with 4 months into release.
---
Any of the private server boys remember this playTBC gem?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeHitPGW0DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeHitPGW0DM)
---
It was only not changed because people by and large only started really leveraging it towards the end of vanilla, so it didn't fully buttfuck server economies. It would have, had DM had been released in 2004 and if people had the knowledge now that they do.
---
Have fun waiting a lot longer for bwl
---
Raging Clue on Bigglesworth lmao
---
rogues arent blanket overpowered in pvp. they are strong against some things, but weak against others. if any spellcasters gets first strike on a rogue, they basically auto lose. druids can prevent them from stealthing too
---
I'm 42 but started 3 weeks late. Frankly, 30s to 40s are rough with shot xp from dungeons and  questing becomes really hard on a horde dominated server. I've been getting hit by 5 man skull parties for the past 2 weeks in STV, Desolace, and Badlands. It slows down leveling quite a bit. I'm probably between 4-5 hours per level. 4-5 hours for a single day is absolutely not casual.
---
In which realm is it?
---
G R I Z Z L Y?
---
Elune bless your hearts for griefing the Horde and keeping this server alive.
---
But that doesn't fall in line with their "kEeP VaNiLlA hOw It WaS" narrative they push every day
---
Rogues only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting.
---
This doesn't look quite as bad as the fuck ups Bethesda has done
---
I was just about to sue cocaine for being as addictive as Fortnite... what are the odds.
---
It's not about China  
---
It's about Blizzard and solidarity among gamers. The way they overreacted to a harmless political statement makes me not wanna give them extra bucks.
---
hahaha I also had a "shit list" back on Stallag, but they were people on my faction that I would rather keep an eye on, in case they grew up eventually.
---
Haven't really found that many people to add to my shitlist since I came to Heartseeker. I might have ended up on someone's kos list this week because I accidentally (I SWEAR) mindblast crit them+pain+mind flay. Once I realised they weren't a mob, I stopped and /sorry, but then other alliance around me decided to camp them for like an hour. I guess that'll teach them to stand still for upwards to 2 minutes in a mob camp.
---
I guess difficult is a very subjective term
---
It's topical because the same exact situation is happening. It's not a slippery slope. It's here. It doesn't matter whether they utilize the companies platform to do it or not. Any employee that publicly criticizes China will lead to an outright ban if they don't fire and outright condemn them. The severity of the punishment proves that Blizzard did it to appease China, thereby explicitly supporting them in my opinion.
---
Original Archage, yes. The new Unchained is a seperate game that took away any pay2win or cash shops or rng boxes and such.
---
If you wait for Dal'Rend set chances are AQ will be out before you start raiding.
---
TBC in May confirmed!!
---
Prior to P3 and having access to Quel'serrar and Maladath, there is not advantage to being that deep in Fury.
---
Fury/Prot is a response to having geared to the teeth DPS in your raid, to avoid threat throttling, and should still only be done if your healers are also well geared and can deal with the lack of mitigation.
---
The biggest benefit of it was that you could potentially split a pack in half by only retaining aggro on one or two of the mobs, while the others reset. There's a couple packs in UBRS that come to mind (completely unrelated to my group wiping to them last night) where it's just so much easier to only deal with half the pack if you can get away with it. The other great thing was if you botched the pull and got more than you bargained for, you could FD and try again. I find it really interesting that the meta has changed on this, seemingly purely through a change in culture, rather than anything having to necessarily do with mechanics.
---
And so that can earn me how much gold per hour?
---
What's stopping you from doing all content? Does the addition of DM remove any of the other dungeons? Just because more optimal options exist doesn't mean you have to only do those. It's entirely up to you. You're just looking for something to bitch about
---
Well, youre kidding youself if you think DM was the deal breaker, it was the tuning that tipped the scales, not some DM gear.  They wanted it to be unbeatable.
---
Also fuck Apple
---
If you paid attention to quest text it tells you the Raptors are intelligent and made them themselves
---
i think the point he was trying to make was you'll get smacked at 45. You could maybe clear one wing with the satyrs, but the other wings are like 55+
---
The WoW Classic speedrun just saved like 30 frames. What a champion.
---
Everyone freaking out about a new dungeon that isn't even an endgame dungeon? Guys this is dire maul, not naxx. Relax.
---
Yea but we had to do it for the lowbies!
---
The protests are not "peaceful" road blockings (which aren't peaceful by any means), but are extremely violent riots. The protesters have engaged in combat engineering and a built a trebuchet from bamboo. The umbrellas are used as shields to protect them from tear gas canisters and their own bricks. They have aimed lasers at Chinese military barracks, prompting a nonviolent warning from the soldiers. 
---
The last time such a protest (both the use of combat engineering and seige weaponry and in the request for the lawful ruler to resign) was seen was the Euromaidan, the Ukrainian protests and revolution. China has every right to stop a revolution in their own nation.
---
I support the HK protestors, they are doing what we did 200+ years ago when we gave King George III the middle finger, but Blizzard is correct to ban him for using their event to advertise a revolution.
---

---
I canceled my WoW classic subscription today in response. I had wanted to play more, but there are many other worthy games deserving of my time, and many other game makers that are more deserving of my money.
---
Specifically, how will it drastically effect the economy, please elaborate.
---
How valuable is nature's focus (anti-interruption) vs tranquil spirit?
---
They are. The single-target threat issue is largely overblown at this stage, especially in dungeons. It's only once gear starts to outscale their spell ranks that it becomes an issue, and that doesn't happen until 60 with BiS.
---
17 days played, 1 60 warr, and a level 30. Full prebis for tanking, dps, and pvp sets. 300armorsmithing with revered TB. I play a lot, every day as much as I can. And I am very very upset they are releasing dm this early. It is a bad decision and most people I've discussed with in my MC/Ony clearing guild are also unhappy they are rushing content.
---
You get upset that he makes a overstepping statement and then make one for yourself. You and him are both wrong. Not everyone feels one way, there are lots of people on both sides
---
They recently split the servers into different tabs. Make sure you’re on the correct tab - it defaults to US-West.
---
Why would they if they got rid of the rule about banning people for expressing politics on their streams? People don't want guys getting banned for expressing political opinions so why would they ban a guy for expressing a political opinion? You can't have it both ways. Just because you agree with the opinion now doesn't mean you are going to in the future.
---
Are you me? I forgot how slow this fucking game is after 40.
---
&gt; But I am going to do what's in my power to help, because I don't know how else to.
---
If you think boycotting Blizzard will affect the Chinese government or their way of life, you are seriously deluded.  You could, however, stop buying Chinese-made goods, which is _actually_ what's propping up the Chinese government.  But I'm guessing you don't care enough about that to _actually_ inconvenience yourself.
---
Blizzard can get fucked. I'm not going to resub until they issue an apology and give blitzchung his money back, if they don't (most likely) then that's it for classic I suppose.
---
rightclick - add to Kill on Sight list. This also flags their guild KOS, and I know I will eventually run across a member of their guild half my level some day. Could even be them on their alt!
---
I really like this build. Maybe only thing I would change is put 2 in imp BoW.  what do you think about finishing Parry and getting conviction instead?
---
&gt;Probably better at keeping threat too,
---
Absolutely not the case
---
Canceled my sub today... just got to lvl 30 on my Pally just the other day. 
---
America is with you!
---
There are 2 kinds of people, the people that use their phone on the toilet, and then there's you
---
even for the hardcore its too fast, its takes like 15 weeks to fully gear a 40 man out of MC/ony.
---
Said swords are reserved, went inside and started clearing, then mid-run said next boss drop is also reserved. I said it's unfair and got removed from the group :D
---
The difference you see is because of your ISP routing connections differently than your friends' ISP... I don't know how many times I have to repeat this. Not all ISPs are equal or prioritize network traffic routes equally. The actual latency difference made by the location difference for east/west servers in WoW is still only 12-18ms no matter where you are.
---
Your cs analogy is not relevant.
---
"Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard's sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.”
---
Thats the rule Blizzard sighted. It's completely up to them whether or not a rule was violated.
---
Imagine thinking China is communist in any, way,  shape or form. You’ve made it clear that you don’t have the slightest clue about foreign affairs or economics.
---
You're the one being apathetic and ignorant.
---
Blizzard was put in a crappy situation. Their platform was hijacked. By failing to apply the ban, Blizzard would be perceived as implicitly supporting the Hong Kong protesters, whereas applying the ban does the opposite. Either way, they look like the asshole to some portion of the population, which isn’t an enviable position to be in, particularly as a company. In the end, they resolved on adhering to the Code of Conduct they implemented.
---
Shhh it's a secret
---
&gt; Once I got my whirlwind axe at 32, totally different story.
---
Around the high 40's the story will be back to the same old thing again. Weapon upgrades are just the life of a warrior. Find them and you are great, dont and you die to same level mobs.
---
To think how far Blizzard has fallen, very sad.
---
Items in order of being sent:

You don't have to write scripts anymore. /startattack will work
---
&lt;Arch Enemy&gt;
---
In some games people pay IRL money for in game title but having Arch Enemy under my name is better than all titles in any game.
---
I like serious guild names tho. Lol-for-2-second-meme-guild-names do nothing for me beyond that 2 seconds. I won't join a guild with a shitty name.
---
Thank goodness for your great and unmatched wisdom u/Hexxys, your omnipotence is inspiring.
---
I've been playing a couple hours a day since Classic launched, and I'll probably hit 56 tonight.  I've run BRD one time, let alone the BRS or Molten Core. 
---
As soon as I hit 60 and want to start regularly running UBRS, that's going to be 'last week's instance' and everyone will be on to DM.
---
I'm surprised that the only Brazil realm was low population when I checked at 3pm est today
---
In BFA my main is on argent Dawn us est. Despite it being an to realm a large portion of the players I encountered where based on Brazil realms
---
Yeah...im kinda doubtful that any server has *that* few 60s.  Im on a medium pop pve server that was released a few hours after launch (so not one of the big ones, and FAR fewer 'hardcore' players) and there absolutely has to be way more than that.
---
I just checked.  Theres 94 60s **online** in the mid afternoon (2+ hours before things really start to pick up, and nowhere near peak) just on the Alliance side.
---
Tauren female druid here, yes we have the same problem. Maybe a deviate delight form will allow you.
---
If you want to experience the content you can, it's not like brd or ST are closed once DM comes out. This makes no sense.
---
I sold my 45 Activision shares too... I picked up right after classic launched made a solid 6%.
---
My Shaman is meant to be ele/enh and I thought I would just take the level 60 configuration as I leveled up. This would have been fine had I started with the Ele talents, I think. Going Enhance first has really slowed things down. Aside from not having Stormstrike it's also more gear dependent.
---
Starting to work more towards caster stats so I can escape the autoattack hell. lol
---
And I believe you but I've no ideas what to change I looked up forums and asked several other images and they just dont know what to change because they claim to use the same addons
---
r/AwardSpeechEdits
---
I will literally tell dps to do anything they can to increase their dps if we don't wipe from it.
---
Like if you are having such a trouble, you are definitely doing something wrong.
---
Yeah small business has a smaller margin for error,  but big businesses literally have a fund to deal with lawsuits, or other unexpected expenses. 
---
It’s built into their budget and they plan for these types of these, but also if they can offset short term losses for larger long term gains, they will. 
---
And that’s what they’re betting on here.
---
I haven’t played since MoP.
---
[Link](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/china-and-tibet) to *some* of the stuff China is doing, not including interfering with the government of other countries, making their own citizens "disappear," and much, much more.
---
&gt; Authorities dramatically stepped up repression and systematic abuses against the 13 million Turkic Muslims, including Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs, in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region. Authorities have carried out mass arbitrary detention, torture, and mistreatment of some of them in various detention facilities, and increasingly imposed pervasive controls on daily life. New regulations in Tibet now criminalize even traditional forms of social action, including community mediation by religious figures. In Hong Kong, a region promised “a high degree of autonomy” under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments hastened their efforts in 2018 to undermine people’s rights to free speech and political participation.
---
Dang, grats to you making it to 60 even after seeing no matter what gear you get you still look awful as a Gnome.
---
Thanks babe
---
You know Tencent, which owns part of Blizzard, also owns part of Reddit right?
---
I’m sat here at level 43 rn, couldn’t be more relevant
---
China is asshoe.
---
I'm about to hit 57 and am finding 55-60 way better. First off people don't fuck with you as much. Secondly there are way more dungeons to run and you start getting access to BRM and actual loot that will be BiS until MC. You start getting tuned to the end game. WPL and EPL are awesome. Azshara, Burning Steppes, Winterspring, Silithus are also there for questing, in addition to leftover quests from places like Un Goro. 
---
There is also an awesome sense of "I'M ALMOST THERE" that keeps you pushing.  3 more fkn levels and I'm 60.
---
I might change my tune once I get around 58, but I doubt it.
---
Did you clear MC?  Did anyone in your raid have DM gear/enchants?  Id like that same experience please.  Since thats what was planned out and told to us.  Shit i didnt think this was so hard to understand.
---
This is literally how my best and favorite guild in Vanilla started. The guild I was in was top on the server (new server at the time), just about cleared Rag. The GM and some of the other officers were a little assholish, which just kept getting worse until the main tank quit. I was off tank, and did the same slightly after. Very shortly after that, with much encouragement from old guildies, he started his own guild and almost everyone that wasn't an asshole from the old guild jumped ship. It was easily the best guild I was ever in. We ended up staying top of the realm all through vanilla, and had fun doing it.
---
It absolutely affects casuals.
---
Phase 2 should be far enough in the future that regularly playing casual players could be ready for it. But we can already see that Blizz intends to push the content through quickly.
---
I would. I'd rather have a pug rogue than a pug mage any day of the week. The two best random classes I've found are rogue and paladin, because no one wants them in dungeons and they're literally forced to play at a higher level to gain the acceptance that even a bad mage immediately gets. 
---
56 is more than enough for LBRS. I did it easily at 56 as a tank, with no problems.
---
Same boat. I'm 20 and she's 16. I created another char to play solo and it's 12. We have some time but it's never together so we're so behind. Now the market is different and barely anyone in darkshore or Westfall.
---
There should be a server for super casuals and some for super hardcore where they get content early.
---
This guy knows his shit!
---
Fucking fools. *You had me.* **You had me!!** That’s the funny part about it. I thought I was done, and you reeled me back in with Classic. Only to forfeit me like this, and gain a lifelong enemy. You fucking evil twits.
---
Blizzard silenced someone who could have affected their income from China. You’re pretty retarded huh?
---
It's amazing to me that you really didn't know this person but you claimed to have been playing with him for years, he just now showed who he was, that's depressing.  
---
Our core had a similar issue on Krom, the GM for the guild we briefly joined was toxic and was talking negatively about anyone who wasn't 60, about 2 weeks ago.  I left the guild, created my own and have so far enjoyed everything a lot more.
---
Same dude...when I get back to work after the weekend I just wonder where the time went. It's crazy, genuinely haven't felt like I've had a full weekend since classic released, I have, and played Wow the entire time.
---
What complaining? Just making an observation that the community on this sub isn't representative of the community at large.
---
If you are the only player on the server then yeah, questing is probably the fastest. Once you get to a camp with 12 mobs that you need to kill ~30 of to get enough quest drops thats currently being camped by 4 other people your xp/hour falls right off a fucking cliff. You can mitigate it somewhat by looping around and fighting wildlife but the other 4 dudes probably have that same idea. God help you if theres a named mob that has a long respawn.
---
you cant do skinning without an group as warrior devilsaurs dont get down dragons neither (if they are elite)
---
You'll burn out on sham.
---
Convinced my friends to roll alliance because I was supposed to play with a cute girl I played BFA with, but she quit at 38.
---
Not my best decision...
---
wait....what....
---
I do too, on top of my job, but I'm not hardcore because I'm not on allll day. I'm casual.
---
I don't know how it makes you hardcore to not have any other responsibilities or care to do anything else. It makes you obsessed.
---
Seems like Blizzard can just say whatever they want breaks the rule?
---
No, not at all. These people are affiliated with Blizzard. The interview in question was a post-game interview. It's not even like this was a personal blog on Facebook.
---
The casters seems harsh though.
---
Am I missing something? The problem is not China doing China things (more than normally) but Blizzard doing China things?
---
It's a 2 week difference from when it came out in vanilla. Lol. Don't be so dramatic.
---
I'm curious: how do you play WoW on your phone?
---
It makes it so you dont  have to experience what? Sitting in LBRS farming a 5% drop black crow for the 50th time?
---
There is still prebis gear in every dungeon and you wont miss that content at all.
---
Saw a 57 hpally getting picked on and Howl of Terror'd in the middle of the Horde two went inside the instance and the others ran long enough the hpally was finally able to zone in.
---
Canceled my subscription.
---
Bye guys.
---
you must have missed the video that came out yesterday announcing that dire maul was coming out early. literally next week
---
Mine says "hang dong" due to our guild being &lt;Thundergun Express&gt;
---
I told them this is absolutely abysmal. I've defended them for so long but this spit in the face of human rights is where I too draw the line.
---
The quality of their work has deteriorated to a point of barely being recognizable and now this? What happened to the community that helped so many of through probably some of the darkest times of our lives.
---
How the mighty have fallen...
---
Can we explain me more clearly why people are mad? 
---
Here’s how I see it with my limited knowledge to the situation and I’d like to be clarified...
---
Police officer : "Sir you are going faster than the speed limit"
---
Neighborhood: "fuck this I’m canceling my driver liscence"
---
I don’t disregard what’s happening in China and I find it sad and bad. But Is it me or once again.... the western side of the world is appropriating itself the topic to whine. You guys mix the apples
---
And the oranges and boycott the strawberries. 
---
It’s really just my vision from my point of view, don’t go hate/flame me. If you have an opinion or a clarification, comment/reply in a good polite manner.
---
MP5?
---
no way that belt from arena is rare. Every mage in my guild has it when I tried for savage glad like 100 times
---
Thx
---
Don't fury prot until phase 3
---
Release time seems appropriate to an EU player.
---
Dammnnnnn this is sick!
---
Typical dev improvements, makes more sense logically while being more cumbersome to the user
---
It’s that first sentence of the second paragraph that leads me to interpret it the way I do.  It’s just a description of dire maul as a dungeon, and not a description of what I’ll call phase 1.5.
---
Dont listen to him so much.  Go shadow and affliction.  Multidot everything.  If it ever looks like it might hurt a little a fear should keep them busy until they die.  Last hitting will be fine as long as you both focus different targets for the last hit portion.   Priest can snipe a last hit with mind blast and you should have 3-4 dots ticking which should beat shadow word pain.
---
Releasing honor system right now would be a disaster, everyone who isn't already 60 would quit the game because they wouldn't be able to play it anymore.
---
Excellent Sunny reference.
---
I like how you omitted the "that's debatable part". Makes me think of the meme that zooms in on a particular piece of text 3-4 times.
---
Disagree for the sake of disagreeing?
---
already done.
---
server isn't necessary behind...
---
lvl 60s have nothing to do, so as soon as something appears to be remotely lucrative, you can be sure 3 dozen of people will jump on it and drive the price down. Why buy anything when you have nothing better than do? Farm it.
---
aka: mana pot peaked a little bit over 12g a stack during the weekend... as a result, there's now 200 of them at 10g/stack.
---
What’s the blizzard affair? Link?
---
My main concern is that if this is because Blizzard is feeling pressure to release content faster already, then it makes it a lot less likely that they're going to go down the road of building new Classic+ content vs. just releasing the already made expansions.
---
i dont want to
---
Mmmm I took 10 days off in my levelling process, and I look after my kid all day. Wouldn’t exactly call my self hard core.
---
Lol, it's not that expensive. You buy your healer's water then.
---
It's the Chinese Butters! They are already here.
---
I don't think that'd be wiser.  Eventually classic is going to run out without adopting new content or new expansions.  Drawing it out isn't going to serve much purpose beyond frustrating most players, forcing long periods of stagnation.
---
If you play for 6 to 7 hours a day and still not 60 or cleared all dungeons, you are definitely casual.
---
I work a full time job and play bit each evening. Im level 60 w full pre raid bis farming MC each week with nothing to do.
---
If you play that much and havent seen the content, you made a concious choice to level slow or fuck around in some way (leveled alts im guessing).
---
coulda sworn they used the word metal when they announced it...
---
Oh well, perhaps that is so. I just notice whenever the warriors end up tanking on their backs despite being spam healed. I'm thinking mainly of SM Cath through Mara - perhaps the chances of this happening has not occured to you, if you are a tank and know what you are doing. Having healed those dungeons I have seen all kinds of unpleasant things relating to tanking - and, to be fair, a goodish number of great tanks who ended up in my Friends list.
---
it was more in relation to the wpvp that happened. with flying and sharding you'd never have seen those hordes again.
---
What are these strange squiggles next to the image?!?
---
That makes sense. Good for him!
---
neither, you should reroll if you want to pvp.
---
See my new "ninja loots for dummys" book out now! Only 200$
---
And thats a problem...?
---
Again it's not that I'm having trouble but you don't seem to get my point so its pointless to continue this
---
Yes but it’s more to do with blizzard banning a hearthstone tournament winner for voicing support in Hong Kong
---
I took a 8 year break from WoW before Classic..I dont need this game. Goodbye.
---
Oh, didn’t know that. I’ve been trying to use it to place traps down and haven’t been successful yet, at least now I know why.
---
Something to take into account is 1.12 power inflation. Compared to launch. Classes now are essentially classes right before tbc launched. And a launch warrior is laughable compared to what we have now.
---
streamers bring nothing to anything
---
Someone is still upset at being called a wrath baby 10 years ago
---
Exactly... within the sphere of control china is focused on (their domestic audience) they have all the control required to contextualize events like this and the recent nba twitter fun as either non events or appropriate control of subversive speech. 
---
While the international media narrative isnt *completely* without meaning to them, it is *vastly* less important than controlling the narrative at home. 
---
They cant hear Streisand too well in that echo chamber.
---
Im looking VERY simply for an equipment addon that lets me equip Trinkets more easily, ie. at the BARE minimum, so if i right click a trinket, it equips into my first trinket slot, instead of the retarded random equip that 1.13 does now.
---
at best, I just want to have a more advanced one, which it unequips the trinket thats still on CD and I can give priority to have certain trinkets.
---
nonono blizzard #0 taiwan #1 china #2
---
They banned blitzchung for voicing a political opinion, which they have every right to do as part of their ToS, 
---
you said they wouldn’t ban a guy for voicing the opposite, because the backlash they’re currently receiving, 
---
I simply meant if they ban the guy voicing the opposite opinion regardless, then they are showing consistency in their no politics rule.
---
Great answer.
---
The group as a whole benefits. You as an individual do not benefit.  
---
Would you still say the group as a whole didn't benefit if you were allowed to roll but didn't win?  
---
Not sure why you're segregating the skinner out as a different part of the group.
---
Standing with you and the rest of HK. Cancelled my sub since original vanilla/opening week. A company has never made me so physically sick to my stomach.
---
&gt;executing the role that usually gets blamed for wiping.

You charge or ranged pull a mob to aggro the pack, pop bloodrage, then (once you've had enough time for a single auto-attack) the DPS ***fucking unload*** on the other mobs that you ***might*** have been able to get a demo shout on.  Then:

Switch target &gt; taunt &gt; switch target &gt; battle stance &gt; mocking blow (both threat overrides now on CD) &gt; save rage for WW, shield block if no revenge procs &gt; mocking blow wears off and mob sprints toward ranged DPS who is ***still unloading on it***, and runs away from the group, jumping and spazzing all the while &gt; switch target &gt; berserker stance &gt; intercept &gt; mobs are now split to hell and you're at 0 rage because each DPS is unloading into separate targets; pull ends at some point, possibly some player deaths or a wipe, and (of course) at least one of the DPS pipes up:
---
"Can you tank better?"
---
Only X more pulls until the dungeon is finished...
---
&gt; It is a clear and distinct bug that cannot be replicated on a true 1.12 native client and server.
---
[Betcha a dollar it can.](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3391/thrash) It can also apparently stack if one isn't consumed.
---
I think you mean a disc priest with holy nova. PI is basically a requirement to DM lasher farm with any gear we have access to now.
---
how hard is it to skin for yourself alone tho? genuinely curious
---
I think retail has more addicting qualities to it than classic, that is a part of the reason why I prefer classic to retail.  
---
In retail its like ... did you do your dailies?  Your weekly LFR?  Have you done enough islands?  What about a mythic +10?  Don't forget about titanforging/legendaries, so you can still do older content.  Send your followers on missions every 4 hours, otherwise you're missing out!
---
Eh?
---
It works when it works. It reduces threat but that doesn't mean it completely removes all agro like feign death.
---
Don't expect to aimed shot+multishot then disengage. 
---
Threat has meters. For example, if aimed shot = +500 threat and multishot = +500 threat and disengage removes 700 threat then it won't work.
---
But in dungeons groups, when that mob comes running caz you hit it with a multishot, run it back to the tank, use disengage, and you're good (unless you miss).
---
But your warrior or pally or any melee alt a level 5 or 6 green weapon. It's amazingly fast. You'll love levelling your warrior if you feed him gear, food, and cloth for bandages.
---
L
---
Retail leveling can't be used as a difficulty scale. You can't die unless you're trying to.
---
For Classic, git gud.
---
I’m not sure, it appears to be written in calligraphy.
---
I would love to. I want no part of their 5G internet. I want no part of their facial recognition and online social platforms. I want no part of competing with their steel workers to build boats where 10 men can die in their shipyards per boat for no cost. I want my pillows knitted and my apple pies baked in places where i'd sleep and eat them.
---
It's a HUGE change to how the players interact with the gameworld.
---
Authoritarian censorship is the root of the problem...not capitalism.
---
You're welcome?
---
I just made a horde toon on your server and looked it up.
---
Theres currently more than 335 lvl 60 horde toons logged on.  Not sure exactly how many because theres 50+ undead mages and i dont have the time to try to sort it out by guild or whatever to bypass the 50 toon /who limit.
---
The numbers referenced are 1000% bullshit.  Theres more people **online** in the middle of the afternoon than what that data says for there are **total** lvl 60s.
---
Current content, yes? Raid content comes in phases. While content is current final boss kills/hard modes/Heroics/mythics/whatever have always been cleared by a miniscule number of players. Some bosses have as low as a 0.20% kill rate.
---
Dude, we've got the rest of our lives to play this video game. I don't see why we're rushing in the first place.
---
Nobody's forcing you to run through these places before trying MC... Its also really not that hard as it is, half the damn pulls in MC are harder than the bosses, christ, the pug i've been running with did ony with 25 people after wiping on rag for a bit.
---
Look at the nature and purpose of the message, not the content of the message itself.
---
Thanks for your assessment :)
---
Please provide his follow up response to your last one. I'm really curious now.
---
Seriously blizzard?
---
&gt; So the whole world should wait for you?
---
Funny that when the plans are changed in your favor, that suddenly im the asshole for saying "hey you said the plan was this before?"  lol, ok guy. 
---
You know MC was cleared in week 1 by people in greens who make up less than 1% of the playerbase, are completely UNRELATED and quite frankly irrelevant to this discussion.  Those people will shit all over dire maul in 15 minutes flat and go back to being bored as fuck before the weekends over.
---
Searing Gorge is weird. I saw a big red untargettable dragon in there. It was "flying" in random directions without moving its wings until it clipped through the floor.
---
If you think China is communist then I have some land in Florida to sell you

WoW Classic servers launched 49 days before Dire Maul.
---
No one would label you a casual...
---
You mean aside from the one on the front page with 60k upvotes?  So they're deleting spam?
---
If it's a pug the group as a whole ceases to exist after the dungeon
---
If you look under the bridge when you enter scholo, the room is filled with mobs (to discourage jumping I suppose). But when you get to that room normally, there's only 4 packs in the corners + couple spiders. When/how do all the other mobs disappear?
---
This is a lot of words to say that you don't believe that nuking this situation from orbit somehow doesn't equate to portraying the exact message it does while hiding behind the thin veneer of "politics". 
---
If it had been a simple rule breaking, they would have appropriately reprimanded the people involved as they have with past situations. Instead they scorched the earth and salted the fields in a very public manner. Contextually they are clearly currying favor with China.
---
I specifically do not have the assmption that pre-raid BIS is required to clear content. wut?  I specifically elaborated on how I don't have it.   thus the power level increase from DM gear doesn't have a substantial impact, its already easy to outgear without it....
---
Thanks for your sarcastic fucking list but guess what.   I *have* sifted through it, and i'm telling you it doesn't make a huge difference.    I'm tell you that saying  "DON'T DO THIS PLEASE!... because.. uhh reasons, im not 60 its not FAaaaaaiiirrrr"
---
You don't have any actual good reasons that this content should be delayed.  The end.   I know that you don't because I spend more time playing and researching this stuff and i played more in vanilla and have a better understanding of the impact.
---
Trust me when i say, it doesn't affect you.   It doesn't make pre-raid gearing any easier, it actually spreads the loot out between more dungeons.  It doesnt help anyone whos already way ahead of you do anything better or faster in a way that affects you.  It doesnt diminish your ability to do these things when you reach max level.
---
People who play the game more will ALWAYS have an advantage over people who don't.  Get over it.
---
You're also asking about solo pvp only.
---
In a melee cleave group, you already know enhance is completely absurd.
---
I'll tell you what the problem at 60  is: Warriors chasing those golden goose BIS drops from their wowhead list, with complete disregard to the needs of other classes, who can easily be replaced compared to tanking warriors. Got their Mirah's Song and their Stone cape? Buhbye Plaguelands, never tanking these dungeons again! 
---
Sorry for ranting, but that's just how it looks like. They get their stuff, and then it's Arena/Angerforge only.
---
I agree it was smarter to release DM first and don’t really have an issue with it. My concern is more the pacing of the release of new content, which if this patch tells us anything of the pacing it will be too fast IMO. 
---
My concern is the world will die, I won’t be able to experience the same fun with alts as my first play through and everyone will raid log.
---
But as far as I'm concerned unless you can prove you started playing day 1. I dont care what you say about how hard it used to be.  Classes were underpowered to an extreme so it felt harder.
---
Don't know if this is allowed, but OP pretty much said they would unsub from Blizzard due to the Blitzvhung incident, and urged everyone to do the same.
---
I didn't until today. We should all stop using reddit to prevent them from getting ad money then right?
---
That guy just did :)
---
Is your hunter a dwarf? If no, sorry. Mechanostriders are restricted to dwarf and gnome.
---
Hehe, yeah, I get you. I am just above 30 but I feel I've been no-lifing this shit, playing almost every day, neglecting some other hobbies. No vacation though :D
---
But they aren't? DM came out after a couple of months in vanilla. Nothing different about this coming out now.   
---
I wasn't 60 then, I'm not 60 now.
---
Yeah the US has totally never done that nope.
---
American here! Cancelled!
---
Blizzard in 2018: Many our Western fan-base really disliked our Blizzcon this year.
---
Blizzard in 2019: Hold my beer.
---
Yeah I mean I just learned that game existed.
---
How does the classic hemo build which is basically the first link fair in pve?
---
A few years is better than I was able to get out of my Razer and Logitech mice. I just bought a rival 500 a couple months ago so we will see how long that lasts.
---
Yes this has been my experience exactly. 40-42 was brutal. Then I was able to struggle with some low quests in feralas, and get a level from uldaman and associated quests. I finally dinged 44 and tanaris has opened up for me. Hoping it starts chugging along again because man did my leveling ever slow down for a while there.
---
Just unsubbed. Severely disappointed. 10 years of wow and blizzard games gone in a moment. Fuck you blizzard.

What does dm add for fury warriors ?

I for sure would have benefited for professional help when I was a kid, but I would have never sought out help unless my parents made me. I’d wager 95 percent of kids wouldn’t even know how to set up an appointment to get professional help. Ultimately I think the only ones who can make a difference are the parents.

Based on what I'm reading here it seems they might just be pushing this one early because it includes three very big items that would be less fun to wait for:
---
Key rings
---
Mage water past lvl 55
---
Lock/pally mount
---
Same, 40-50 took me a week of 4+ hours a day. 50-59 took a weekend.
---
i could care less if diremaul gets released and i'm still lower 40's. It's not a raid tier, it's more gear for people already at 60 to start doing and more for us to do when we get there. just because it's released now doesn't mean we have rush to it the moment it drops.

"I have an issue with Blizzard's response to this political issue. But my issue is not political."

That's some nice mental gymnastics there. Posting that you disagree with a company's stance on a political issue is political in nature.

It only works if your pet can draw aggro, also highly affective in dungeons. I find though that it rarely works on enemy’s that are more then 3 lvls above. I do find it useful though to help feign death be more effective against higher level enemies. Once successful hit, pop feign death asap.
---
If you have a lot of hit, you're sitting at 55+ rage far more often.
---
This isn't rocket science.
---
If this is true, then we'll see Blizzard turn over a ton of employee's in the near future.
---
Will do, its been a few days, I'm worried I went a little to far than with my insults because Coinbag has been silent haha.
---
50-60 is a slog, currently in searing gorge and when I'm not chain ranked by rogues its fighting for mobs
---
Or 3 weeks if you're EU...
---
Awesome, it's all irrelevant gear once phase 2 actually hits anyhow. High warlord or bust. Then you don't have to do MC, BWL, really raiding becomes irrelevant for you most of the time to begin with right?
---
Ok fair enough on that we can agree
---
If the weight is only 20KG you don't need 40 people to carry it.
---
Incorrect. As I stated it doesn't matter if it's political or personal, you gotta keep it to yourself. The USA literally does exactly what you described to it citizens every day. Other countries do too. What you are doing is picking sides and you can't do that.
---
 If a US based player stood up to protest say climate change and this happened, how would you feel? It doesnt matter what the issue is or what your opinion is on it, you are here to play a game. Using the platform to spout your personal feelings or thoughts is disrespectful.  I hate the way slot of things are going in this country but I wouldn't jepordize my job because of them.
---
Can you pm me the seller if possible
---
Thats why its important to level fast and keep up with the current trends... otherwise you're just gonna get carried, people telling others to slow down are dumb
---
Yeah of course, if no money entered the economy by doing dungeons or farming anything, then nobody would have any gold.
---
RIP in pieces other team members. :( Feels not good man.

Rogues who pop evasion against warriors just get crit every 5 seconds.  Idk what you're talking about.  Did you even play vanilla?
---
After reading this I sadly asked Blizzard to delete my account. Been playing Blizzard games since Warcraft II, must have spent thousands on games, DLC, and Hearthstone packs but I'm done now. Seeing an American company cave to a foreign authoritarian regime like was really gross. Plenty of other great stuff to play.
---
Yes, the current rule is too broad and unspecific, but that doesn't answer my question.
---
Been 60 for 2 weeks.
---
Always played a healer Priest. Played vanilla pservers since Wotlk so the “journey” of getting to 60 just needed to be done quickly, mostly because I don’t find it that much fun, for me personally, 60 is when the fun starts.
---
Was shadow until 35, respecced to holy and ran spellcleave and normal groups all the way to 60.
---
Me and my IRL friends started a guild with the goal of making a semi-hardcore raid team. Last week was the first guild only MC and Onyxia and we cleared it all in 2 evenings. Got Benediction and T1 shoulders.
---
Can’t wait for BWL to be more challenged, MC and Onyxia was pretty easy.
---
This isn't retail where every patch is a full reset.
---
For the your gear requirements, go either druid tank and pally healer, or Warrior and druid healer.
---
It's actually easier at this point than it's ever been.
---
I have a 2700x, 32GB RAM and a 2080ti and all I play is satisfactory and classic wow lmao
---
I don't disagree.  I've been telling everyone for years that learning Mandarin should be a priority for all millennials.  The west sets and the east rises.  Anyone who thinks China isn't the world's premiere superpower hasn't been paying attention.  It isn't about military might, it's about economic power, and they've got it, we don't.
---
oh no now the CIA is gonna track everybody down
---
Back in vanilla they were known as a face roll class. As in you could literally roll your face on the keyboard and win. You have 2 dots, mind blast, and mindflay. AOE fear and a silence. 
---
Oversimplification but they definitely are a pretty easy class to play.
---
They invited me. I played with their alts. It wasn't a demand, it was just the end content they were doing once I could join their mains.
---
I didn’t realize blizzard was owned by China. Blizzard is only doing so to prevent loss of income. I don’t know how much more simpler I can make it so that you’ll understand.
---
You need your hand held and told exactly what zones are what levels?
---
Apparently the first few revisions didn't help lmfao, try playing the game first bud
---
It's a random world drop, the base chance is like 0.001% off any mob of the appropriate level (along with a slew of other BoE greens/blues/purps).  Hence, the AH is your friend and farm that gold.
---
Difference between merely doing business with china (the country is populated by humans too!) and participating in the oppression by the regime.
---
Unless you think we should starve the Chinese so they revolt.
---
What can I say, you're just more pro than the rest of us. That doesn't mean we shouldn't get to experience the content.
---
blizzard can have china and keep it, but they have just lost the rest of the world.
---
To be fair, it's expected for blizzard news to make it onto all blizzard game subreddits. LoL makes less ~~than 11~~ cents.
---
Just fuck their shit up at Blizzcon.
---
Same. I was not subbed at all for years, Classic beckoned me back. The server I'm on is behind (since it wasn't one of the original), very few 60's at all and I'm 2 weeks behind that. I'll be 30 by tonight, but it's not because I'm slacking.
---
Spend less than a gold and get a helm on the AH. But I'm with you as per the level.
---
idk if people asked for it, but they literally explained why they are releasing it early in the developer update video yesterday. they said something along the lines of "we have seen alot of players hit level 60. we have seen alot of ragnaros and onyxia kills. and players are looking for something more to do. so we are releasing dire maul early"
---
Don’t you DARE cease this thread or you shall be smited
---
in nothing but preraid bis you should be at 26% or more crit. That is more than enough. And you have enough armor to not fall over to one crushing blow because you are using stoneshield pots as fury prot. You have the same amount of armor as deep prot. 2200 armor on skullflame shield, the pot gives 2000. 200 difference of armor compared to nearly twice the threat generation is certainly worth the trade off.
---
What level are the kobolds? 35?
---
We need a meme of this pronto! XD
---
A lot of people won't admit to themselves that they abuse the game and play too much, so they'll find it offensive that you try to limit your play time. Like alcoholics that get mad someone else only drinks moderately, they feel judged and inferior for their lack of self control.
---
Yea I'm 33 right now, really struggling. Getting ganked all the time in stv. Maybe farming SM is a good idea.
---
The trick here is to associate Acti-Blizzard with Winnie the Pooh
---
If you're selling the flame sacs for 30s, thank you. I bought all those and some cheap firefin up on my at warrior to make the regular Fire Protection Potions. Not only did I powerlevel my alchemy this way but the pots sell for 1g on Skeram, which is slightly over a 100% mark up on the mats.
---
Meh. It does stall rage generation for the Warrior, which is huge, since whites are not landing. The only thing landing is Overpower, but that is often enough. If it's not, Warrior can just Fear/Piercing Howl and keep distance during Evasion, since they have an out for basically slow/stun/movement impairing effect in a Rogue's toolkit (particularly Dwarf Warriors).
---
Weakauras perhaps, if a buff is displayed in the combat log it's fair game.
---
Show me one similar instance in the past.
---
has it stopped your wow sub?
---
FYI you don't need a hunter to kite drek. To have a problem you'd have to make a raid without mages, hunters, rogues, and edgelord suicide warlocks. That's if you even bother to kite him at all.. which considering he's a 1 tank affair with just a random melee dps dragging him away for the few seconds the tank is CC'd... yah.. it's not a big deal.
---
Because ignoring attacks on human rights should be rewarded? I'd rather delete all my gold than give it to someone like you.
---
yeah probaply but to find one that has spots free is nearly impossible we had raid today and a new warrior was into the group he did perform ok nothing bad but the fact that he got promoted to raider after 1 raid  and doesnt have enchants while I'm still trial is making me angry af
---
Cool there are plenty of other games out there but a group has already moved from classic to bfa  and are enjoying themselves if that's how you feel I can change it.
---
Part of the reason they are releasing DM now is because they are going to have to hold off on world bosses since several servers still need layering to be playable.
---
Hey OP, do you use Wolfshead Helm at all? Curious what place it has, if any, in end game dungeons/raids/pvp.
---
Tooltip is kind of misleading then lol
---
Uh... Thanks. You might want to look into those anger issues though.
---
&gt; Everything you just said here is wrong just so you know
---
You could extend that same exact argument to pvp gear and reputation reward vendors. Why aren't we all raiding the BG vendors come phase 2 for the ridiculously powerful epics and how did they come to get them in the first place?
---
As for your second point they are just fill in pieces, all of the best, most powerful and update items still come from the raids themselves. The badges just let you buy some nice accessories to fill your slots where you haven't had any luck.
---
... you’ll experience the content it’s not like gear magically appears in your bags you have to do something for it. What it’s saving you from is wasting time getting a blue that’s replaced by a slightly better blue in a different dungeon. It’s up to you to play the content no one else’s.
---
I think the optimal course of action is to take your pet off and try to shoot down the mob quick -- I think your pet's aggro radius might be bigger than the mobs "help me" range, but I'm not sure on that one.
---
To be honest, I stopped because from your comments it seems like you're a kid, and I feel bad trolling someone with only a half developed brain.
---
Until TBC. And? You\`re not going to start playing the game for 2 years just because your dream spec isn't there yet?  
---
BTW, being crushable doesn't matter when your healers are already full t3 and you have like 15 000 HP.

---
Are you asking about the class action suit against Epic?
---
The Class action suit originates in Canada and alleges Epic hired psychologists to help come up with ways to make the game more addictive by triggering dopamine responses.
---
Both shit and easily outplayed by pretty much every other class
---
It sounds pretty close though? I'm guessing there may be double now, which equates to what, 2% of the population?
---
Crap, no. Night Elf. I'll probably make a twink Hunter(they gave us the 11 character slots of retail, which means space for one of each of your faction's classes, a bank alt and two twinks) but he obviously wont get up to the level for a mount.
---
Oh well, they were my least favorite "Engineer" mounts anyway.
---
A FEW PEOPLE HAVE HOR! QUICK! RELEASE ALL THE CONTENT!
---
Look at who that guy responded to. The long block of text was explaining why slowing down content was a good thing. Then look at who he replied to. They said that content releases shouldn't bother anyone.
---
Sub canceled. If they change their position I'll be more than happy to resub. I was enjoying playing Classic WoW, but this is bullshit. Fuck China. Fuck Blizzard. #liberatehongkong
---
But your arcanite bars will cost a lot less because of the supply in dire maul, lionheart helm will be cheaper to craft
---
That's fair and I agree with you on all the DM points. Maybe I didn't stress it enough, but DM is not my main concern, as it's a lvl 55 dungeon and all the reasons you said.
---
I'm only concerned about "setting the pace" to fast and that later phases (raid tiers) will come in similar fast fashion. 
---
And I'm not even saying me personally, as I'm probably on the far side of the spectrum (I won't be ready for any raid when it releases, I'm sure of that) but at least a compromise. Don't rush content that much when not even top level players are asking for it. When they will and they will be bored, then sure. It's necessary to cater to the hardcore, I'm not disputing that.
---
It was hard for me to make the decision, but I did it. I love the game, but I can't stand by this. There are plenty of games I can play so if I can sacrifice one to make a small step in combating the growing influence of China, and help the HK people, I'll do it. 
---
I'm the second tank for our guild and told them today I won't be showing up for raids unless they issue an apology.
---
I think the point you are making goes out the window over the fact that the two casters were fired as well. Blizzard's response went above and beyond "don't use our platform for political speech" straight into boot licking "please don't be mad".
---
I know boot licking gets tossed around the internet quite a bit but I don't use the term lightly here.
---
Take a break at 40 and let that rested do pile up lol
---
You aren't hurting anyone.
---
Your post just has a super patronizing tone at best, or is projecting/making a lot of assumptions ("As a lot of people here"). People typically don't like to be told how to enjoy the things they enjoy.

Warriors dont need dire maul gear to be better tanks than feral druids...
---
You're a hero, just know that. I'm proud of u
---
The grinds gonna be more real when you can’t get in a raid and you have to grind another toon because 1/3 of the population is mages 😂
---
Yes I use it for any feral dps/tank activities. I have a better helm but I’m so used to having that rage I can’t play without it
---
Not entirely, there's also large gaps in itemization that are filled in by it.
---
&gt;I used no metrics, just the facts you just stated.  Started in America, headquartered in America, don’t care where more than half their revenue is generated - they can relocate there if they’d like.  
---
So what you're saying is there is no such thing as an international corporation?
---
I guess we have different definitions of casual then. To me, anyone that has devoted enough time to get to the level cap this quickly isn't a casual.
---
And no, I get that plenty of people have more spare time than me. It just surprises me that the definition of "casual" thrown around on this sub is someone who plays for several hours a day. To me, that isn't really casual. It isn't necessarily hardcore either, but it isn't what I'd call casual.

I could never use alt effectively as a modifier, my thumb doesn’t agree with that bind at all. I did bind my g600 mouse buttons to alt+1-9 though.
---
There is absolutely nothing that I'm interested in as a warrior in DM apart from Foror's, so I'd file that one under "Bollocks".
---
There are a few extra options for certain slots, but they're just that: options.
---
I mean. I'm rogue and trying to find a group for anything hurts my soul.
---
But to answer your question? Idk. I'm new to classic and never played before BUT my friend that does know just said that Dire Mail hear is equivalent to raid gear so maybe? But wouldn't that mean bears can also get their raid gear?
---
^ This exactly. I'm at level 43 and I've run maybe 3 dungeons so far? All of those have been on Friday / Saturday nights when my friends aren't around so I have nothing else to do for several hours.
---
I dunno though, as a casual player that plays videogames when there's nothing else to do (although with classic I've been making excuses to play more), I expect to fall behind the majority of the player base. It's just that when I fall far enough behind is when I'm going to lose interest and stop playing altogether. I just want the ride to last a bit longer.
---
You shouldn't let a companies moral pr stunts affect your wallet.
---
I don't know, getting pissed off because some kid that plays video games who shared sentiments completely unrelated to a game, and then got banned by a private video game company seems a bit ridiculous to me.
---
Blizzard will probably apologize after seeing all the outrage, create some sort of fluff piece and assert how they actually support the community, people will come running back and eating up anything that Blizzard offers. But ultimately, nothing will really change. 
---
&gt;But its better to do something than nothing right? 
---
I don't know about that, these things just encourage celebrity outrage... I'd say that doing something productive is better than nothing, but just doing something for the sake of something so that you can feel important probably isn't.
---
Upvote for you.
---
Guilds will be going into MC for a long long time. There are relevant items in there forever, dont worry
---
To end up with the main/off tanking role you need to be in on the ground floor of a guild. I joined up with an establishing guild at level 24. We currently have 20 level 60s and are co-running MC runs with another guild who also has a group of 20 60s while we both fill out our roster.
---
Hit points.   They’re talking about the health bar of the mob you’re attacking.
---
Atiesh
---
I hit a freaking brick wall on my shammy at lvl 46.  I rolled a rogue and bought him some blue weapons and leveled up to 27 in like 4 -5days. I'm going to give the shammy another shot now that he has a good amount of rested xp.
---
How do you read the whole post, almost quote the post, and then miss the point? 
---
Astounding.
---
I’ve cancelled my wow sub. Stated gameplay reason: hong kong
---
If the Dungeon had absolutely nothing good then it wouldn't worth releasing at all would it?
---
Working to change the system that incentivizes companies to act this way would do more than canceling a subscription.  Tell your representatives you would like people to be more important than profits. It will have more effect... slightly less than zero.
---
are there any quest that i need to do in order to get it or it just appears when i'm level 33
---
He definitely broke the rules no matter who he supports.  The casters failed to stop it.  You can’t go on something like this and basically call for a coup.
---
This is not even phase 2.
---
Stv cursed island mobs drop water.
---
Lvl 34? The island in the north west corner of stv comes to mind
---
Ironically reddit itself is mainly owned by China, which is why Every political related subreddit is riddled with anti American propoganda
---
You think half of the max level toons are online at one given point in the middle of the afternoon.....?
---
Blizzard fucked up with this one. Really serious content there.
---
Was the huge mistake in the title regarding checking out retail or writing this post?
---
I doubt China likes it at all given that they're locked in a Trade War and these things don't go unnoticed by our negotiators. China can't just ban western countries on a whim, forever, with no consequences.
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
But really tho Thunderfury represent!
---
No it's not irrelevant.
---
You get to Mc in a month from now. Your raid team is decked out in Mc gear because they've been clearing it for a while
---
How is this different than them having some dm gear and enchants? IT'S THE SAME FUCKING THING
---
did you see what happened during blizzcon 2018?  did you see their stock fall? did you see the hate on reddit and other websites?
---
did you see the boycott against EA when the loot box controversy happened?
---
[ACTVI](https://www.google.com/search?q=actvi+stock) has dropped today after this stunt.  So yes it might be temporary but they do feel it.
---
Couldn't agree more. Was about to post an almost exact version of this. Pushing out dire maul is just what you said, an improvement compared to how it was released in vanilla. If the next two phases are pushed fast, that's when I'll call it quits.
---
I'm currently level 50, enjoying my time, and want to casually raid. I don't want to be catered to in terms of release windows, but I also don't want this classic experience to be fast tracked in half a year just because hardcore players are bored. Only time will tell which path blizzard takes, and hopefully they chose the one that gives the majority of players what they want while allowing everyone to enjoy the game as long as possible.
---
That being said you can't please everybody, and no matter what some players will quit because what they want isnt being given.
---
How is releasing the phases slowly handicapping anyone?
---
Yeah but they went a step further and explained... I'll just show you.
---
&gt; There is no release valve for the Chinese public to vote out the CCP, so the government knows that it needs to do what the public wants because if it continually does things to make life hard for the average Chinese, they will be breaking social stability and push the country to a popular revolt. This is an example of why the Chinese government is able to achieve a public trust approval rating of 83.5%, ...
---
&gt; ... Due to this fear of popular revolt because of the lack of said release valve, the Chinese government is actually doing a vastly better job at representing the needs of the general public and being operated for the many, not the few. Which as I said before is a core concept of democracy.
---
you can't just spout "retail people" as your answer. Not to mention if you're only just 30 you're in the bottom 10%. It would be more offensive to cater to you than others.
---
I'll add a caveat to the other post, it primarily invalidates caster loot from the other dungeons. There are fewer upgrades for melee/tanks from there (though there are a few).
---
Then you get blinded lol.
---
I mean this in the nicest possible way.
---
It's sickening to hear everyone in this thread act as if blizzard employees were firing tear gas at protesters while on the clock. 
---
I've never denied that the situation in Hong Kong is absolutely fucked up. I support their fight and respect the fact that they will not bend unt their 5 demands are met. 
---
However I hold no expectation that a private company that should risk large amounts of income, the loss of which would cause layoffs worldwide, on politics.
---
You can say that this issue is apolitical, but the reality is that it is not. Notice how not a single company which does large amounts of business in China has voiced support for the protesters?
---
Wow... That's low.
---
There isn't much that can be done to improve AoE threat.
---
There is a literal mathematical limit to how much threat you can generate, and even THAT is gated by your Rage generation (which is the hardest thing to manage).
---
Even if you had unlimited rage, you'd be GCD capped on threat output, and the more mobs you throw into the mix, the less threat gets spread between them and DPS WILL pull off.
---
My Mindset in dungeons is:  My job is to keep the Elites off the healer.  If DPS want to AoE, they explicitly take the responsibility of tanking the mob upon themselves.  When my guild's Combat Rogue pops Adrenaline Rush and Blade Flurry, there is ZERO chance ANY tank is keeping both mobs, and he's fully aware.  I try my best to keep one focused on me.  When Mages AoE the huge packs of non-elite mobs, there is ZERO Chance ANY tank is keeping that threat, so they (for the most part) are aware and kite accordingly.
---
I don't know how it all went down, but I can 100% call bullshit that the GM has had no issues with threat with Fast AOE pulls UNLESS he hasn't played since the Demo Shout nerf/bugfix.  There just literally is no way to generate enough threat on all the targets.
---
I run it on a used 2014 Macbook Air. 4GB of RAM and an Intel HD 5000. 
---
Still runs at native resolution. Framerates take a small dip in cities, but normally they’re pretty solid.
---
"And how many  Buzzards should we have?"
---
"More coyotes."
---
Yes I do.
---
This is literally more than what you are doing. Blizzard only cares about money. They feared the chinese government banning their products altogether. That's the only reason.
---
So the best way is to hit them in the heart... or sorry wallet. That's where their heart lies.
---
Then that's your choice to make.  You have the freedom to ignore responsibilities if you so choose.
---
Congrats. My goal is just for my mount so seeing this is really cool.
---
That’s different, why sacrifice my own joy for something I don’t care about?
---
11/10!
---
Calling Archeage generic is pretty ignorant tbh.
---
Right, now imagine that literally every other player has incentive to kill you, and will be roaming the world specifically to find and kill other players.
---
Yes, it will be fucking awesome as a pvp lover, but only if you are high enough that it's not going to simply result in you getting destroyed hundreds of times while trying to level.
---
Love ice hud. I personally turned off my own character frame since I have my HP and Mana around my character and buffs/debuffs in top right.
---
Imagine your life being so void of purpose and meaning that you have to pretend your quitting a video game in support of something you don't actually care about.
---
Holy shit that makes perfect sense because of the dot quest interactions. I am surprised they did that
---
People did farm vendorables in vanilla, though? 
---
I had a mage buddy in my vanilla guild who had 10,000g before we ever killed majordomo.
---
Yes you can set the order. I always put myself then tank then dps in retail, but in Classic so many people are tanking as dps specs that I'm not sure if it'll work or not.
---
That's totally valid. Never once did I say people shouldn't do this.
---
I said don't shit on those who aren't. They probably just want play a video game.
---
Unless they're verbally supporting China's government doing these things. Then you be my guest.
---
I legit despise Prep as a skill. Makes rogue a massive balance issue. Either you balance around prep and make rogue comparatively week without CDs up or you don't balance around it while the skill exists and rogue are broken op in pvp.
---
So you can sell the stuff you farm for more gold and get your epic mount easier. I don't know what class you're playing, but very little gear is bought off the AH at max level, it's collected in instances and raids for the most part.  
---
I don't understand this whole doom and gloom attitude toward DM getting released, especially the economy aspects since we've had  layers since release, which are easy to abuse for monetary gain.
---
Im a 56 hunter. Have like 8.8 days played. Also have full time job. I feel like I'm playing 24/7 if I'm not at work or sleeping.  I still don't understand how ppl got to 60 in the first week or two.  
---
Haven't played for 3 days. Decided to slow it down, and get that rested xp. I'm fine with DM coming out, I just think it's dumb when no lifers do all the content super fast then complain they are bored.
---
Yeah, sides of the issue aside, blizzard clearly is going to ban someone who uses their live events or streams as a platform.
---
All these mega-sized American and European companies are showing their true colors as the people continue to support the Honk Kong protests. This is insane.
---
I had 7 60s in vanilla, I prefer warriors.
---
Time to head back to private servers guys. Fuck this shit.
---
You're acting as if MC is gonna pack it's shit up and leave
---
ok Let's be real. As a vanilla warrior who has played the class to the utmost limits and was actually one of the best rogue duelers/fighters on the server, I used to get cross faction duel requests from rogues. this is complete crap. Over power has a 5 second cooldown and is the only ability you will hit, honestly rogues have every tool in the game to run circles around a warrior. It takes a GOOD warrior to beat even a SHIT rogue, so if the rogue is good, there really isn't much room for counter play.
---
In the end, with will tier gear equivalent class trinkets and cooldowns all a rogue has to do is pop evasion, adrenaline rush, spam eviscerate and stand in a warriors face to win, there is nothing he can do. (I say it time and time again combat is the hardest rogue spec to fight for this reason, sub is only hard if they prep and double up on cooldowns)
---
Hey bubble,
---
I just wanted to say.
---
I appreciate you letting me live rent free in your head.
---
Keep commenting on this thread all day, you don’t really seem to get it.
---
Legalize Felweed is better.
---
Canceled my subscription this morning because I'm sick of Blizzard being shitty like this. It's bad enough they wanted to charge 15 dollars a month to play old content when we could do it on private servers for free. I'll spend my money and gaming time elsewhere. There are way too many great games out there that I dont even have time for. It was fun while it lasted guys.
---
If you cared so much about not supporting Reddit because of it's relation to Tencent, then delete your account and stop browsing Reddit. All your activity, even lurking, is a net benefit to Reddit.
---
This guy knows his stuff 🤩 baaah hahaha 😅
---
Delete and restart. You won’t! No balls! 🤣
---
This is my first playthrough of the game but I was so happy to find out I got to ride a robo ostrich as a gnome. I love the screech it makes when you first mount.
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot is great... when it works. In my experience this addon is an incomplete mess. The config menu isn't in and might never be. ClassicCodex I have no experience with. Questie won't steer you through the game like a guide addon will, but it does what it does very well, showing available quests and quest locations as you pick them up.
---
Well, to be fair, I don't think DM is a terrible thing to happen in and of itself. It's just the pace of release is a little worrying. I know some people love to blaze ahead into newer and more challenging scenarios, but there's a fair number of us who feel satisfaction in completing and exploring.
---
Basically, if Blizz keeps releasing additional content so quickly, I'm just going to give up the idea of "mastering" anything, and that's one of the primary reasons why I play any game.
---
Best spot is skinning basilisks just north of Gadgetzan, in 1k flats. Easy 7-8g hr,
---
Then be truthful and say you dont care about other people. Dont down people for caring. Because yes.. this is an actual way to get back at Blizzard.. to say otherwise is a scapegoat for why you dont give a shit about people other than yourself. Just like you blame others for trying to paint themselves as altruistic, when they might not be. You are trying to paint yourself as intelligent for not fighting against something you think is futile, isnt apathetic laziness.
---
I rather play my game and enjoy my life then try to help a lost cause.
---
Dead Mines was in the game from the very start?
---
This! Changes... well not everything, really just one thing. But hey, its a nice change!
---
At what level does one get a wife? And how much gold?
---
Also, it's required for the Warlock and Paladin epic mount quests, which is a pretty big milestone in my opinion. As a warlock who hit 60 yesterday, I'm very glad to hear that I can start working towards my epic mount soon.
---
Ay! That's lit man, hope you had a good time.
---
This is a nice screenshot. Would you mind adding it to our collection on r/classicwowscreenshots as well?
---
It's almost like I gave examples of how it can be impossible to escape some of the companies who do the bad things.
---
It's almost like you missed the idea behind the post.
---
My first thought. I'm with you. GG Blizz.
---
BLIZZARD:
---
&gt;**While we stand by one’s right to express individual thoughts and opinions,** players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules
---
What??? Fuck off
---
Blizzard died when Chris Metzen left.
---
Literally unplayable
---
America wants to know your location.
---
Really?? I’ve been wanting to leave my guild but haven’t found out how yet, thanks!!
---
Cold blood also feels sort of like this. Unless you waste a vanish for a full re open having cold blood on cd sucks. Also respeccing because I need to PvE and being totally gimped in PvP is not great.
---
HW felt bland and repetitive and introduced stupid shit like flying mounts and the whole token loot system which took the fun out of progression (personally). PVP was still shit, so can't really complain about that. i'm also not a fan of having an easy and hard mode for raids. 
---
no content post patch 3.0 for a long time, and the launch content wasn't exactly great (bismark was really cool but pointless because ravana) the next patch wasn't exactly great and the anima grind didn't get any more fun, who would have guessed. 
---
those amazing weekly caps were extended to the crafting script things which was all anyone ever wanted. more caps. there was also no way they could top how epic coil felt as a raid, it was amazing.
---
i may be getting the timeline wrong with this one so feel free to correct it, but wasn't HW around the time they started putting more shit on the cash shop?
---
This is some fucking bullshit. Makes me not want to play
---
Anything under 5% is a normal day. If dropped 2% for ten days that would be significant.
---
If I do strat UD will i get to fight unforgiven?
---
Cancelled my own and the 6 other subs for my family and friends that I paid for. Such a shame. Classic brought me back and the new BfA content actually looked good, but this is inexcusable. Even the tiny drop that 6 subs are to a billion dollar company, I suppose every little speaks.
---
You won't have to spam Strat/Scholo/UBRS nearly as much as me and my friends did because you can just run DM and get better gear. They're catering to YOU, not the hardcore. The hardcore people barely need anything from DM at this point, mostly sidegrades.
---
That's how the quest works. You're meant to hand it in to the Scarlet Grand Crusader in Tyr's Hand while under the rotten apple buff. As soon as you pick the quest up it's shown as ready to turn in.
---
&gt; Why would I? Where did Fox News even come from 
---
The same place your comment about BBC and NYT came from. An example of sensationalism. 
---
&gt; Oh right, the Human Rights Watch, criticized for "poor fact-checking" 
---
Source on this claim? 
---
The other ones you basically gave a generic "that happens everywhere" response as if that justifies it, somehow.
---
And, yes, I did include political activists, because that is part of it, but not the whole. It still demonstrates the point of violation of human rights.
---
New goal; go outside, friggin nerd.
---
Very common for Holy Paladins before getting tier sets.
---
Unsubbed :|
---
&gt; The wave of people who have jobs and lives are around 50-60. 
---
I saw this in other comments as well, you must mean people who only get about an hour or two a day but still try to level as fast as possible? (Serious question!)
---
I work fulltime with wife and kids. I don’t get a chance to play every day, and when I do play I level my primary and secondary prof as well. I’m lvl 33...
---
Often yes, it does depend on the guild.
---
Based on the game director's estimates for Classic (a "couple months" for Phase 2 &amp; 3), we're actually behind schedule: https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=576
---
insert "It's been 84 years..." gif here
---
I already deleted mine
---
Im really glad there are people willing to give where its due. Or take it in this case. Thank you. So dumb to see one side just lob blame at the other constantly.
---
That's totally fine and I hope you're enjoying your time, however do you think the content pace should at all cater to you in this situation?  That would be what, p2 in a year? lol No offense intended cause like I said, fuck yeah enjoy classic at your own pace because that's what's amazing about it, but the game would be dead so fast with that slow a content pace.
---
There isn't one, blizzard made it where census data doesn't work.  Closest know realms to 50/50 Ive seen and heard of are Grobbulus and Incendius right now.
---
Don't worry it's back
---
Oh so there could be 40 horde around you - if none of them touch you none of them show up?
---
&gt;by virtue of having a mount 
---
Be me at 43 with terrible money management. I'm at 62g right now. Maybe it was the shadoweave set, maybe it was [Jaina's Firestarter], maybe it was the 4 runecloth bags. 
---
I'll be honest I still think it was worth it. My wand is strong, my gear is helping me do 600+ crits with mind blast, and 14 slot bags are just time savers
---
AOE mages rush to 60 then start demanding dungeon that is notorious for making AOE mages rich be released early?  SHOCKER.
---
22 priest.  12 paladin.  11 priest (PVE realm, RL friends wanted to play but stopped)  Then got really bored of the priest and wanding, decided to try a warlock on Grobbulous.  Now i'm lv 14 with a lv 6 alt there.
---
So yeah. I'll see Dire Maul around November 2020 at this rate.
---
But it's also been a shit month with a 4 year old and a 6 month old who got sick and gave everyone in the house the bug.
---
I'll get more play time as I go forward now.
---
What you should be doing during that 6 seconds is exactly what the rogue is doing. Jumping in circles around your target to get back hits. I've definitely landed an execute crit after overpowering a rogue during evasion.
---
Does it stack with Aspect of the Cheetah?
---
Legit question, what is the point of having a tank in anything before Blackrock Spire? This game seems to have the same issue OSRS has where enough offense negates the need for any defense.  Every dungeon I've done can be done way more effectively with 4 competent DPS and 1 healer. Tanks simply can't hold AoE aggro well enough to justify having one.
---
An UPDATED VERSION FFS
---
Time gating the raids was really the only they should have done simply to prevent the game from being a massive push to the end game.  Dire Maul and the level 50 quests had no business not being in from release.  THe honor system should have been in from the beginning and maybe a brief window before officially adding the BGs.
---
There is minimal reason to gate shit like AB after wsg/AV or battlegrounds as a whole.  If people want to pvp, then let them do so.  The only things which really have an impact on being gated is the raid progression.
---
I love my paladin, it has awesome utility for both pve and pvp. They are in high demand for raids and can heal any content quite well (tho you might dislike not having aoe heals when you start) 
---
You can also give it a try in prot spec.
---
Druid is the most versatile, prob the best to tank in 5 man (imo). Though their healing is slightly underpowered and do not have a ressurection out of combat
---
they can be keyboard turning and clicker bad and they'll still beat warriors, and that's the problem
---
free action potion + net is gonna make it so you can beat the super shitters but short of that you have no chance in a 1v1
---
any mage able to frost nova and cast a frostbolt/coneofcold is easily gonna do about 2k dmg to you in that global, and youre slowed 60%, and they can blink your one charge and its stun, sooooo yah
---
rogue v warrior is a much, MUCH more fair fight
---
Nothing should make a Druid want to ever drop this helm, sad to say. The effect is too OP.
---
People cancelling their subs for this... I cancelled mine months ago because their games are trash right now!
---
Fuck Blizzard.  I too have uninstalled their games.
---
Not everyone needs lofty, life consuming goals in a video game, like getting rank 14.
---
Blizzard realized they had a problem in Vanilla and BC with &lt;10% of the player base experiencing endgame raiding, which is why we got features like LFR and multiple raid difficulties. I think the stats will be similar in Classic. It doesn't bother me as much because endgame 60 (as opposed to leveling) can be experienced via Retail. I'm interested in seeing if Blizzard does eventually implement a version of a raid finder after all the phases are released - I can see something like a queue limited to your realm. 
---
I accepted a long time ago that as a filthy casual I'm probably never going to be raiding and even though I fall into the most common kind of player I'm not the player Blizzard is targeting. The hardcore group is the most vocal.
---
Still not a slap in the face.
---
Your comment was an incomplete, inaccurate description of what you supposedly felt was at issue.  You said that you wanted to level slow and that you wouldn't have done so if they were going to release DM early.  Then you brought up the economy like it was part of your original argument, when it wasn't mentioned at all at that point.
---
You can even be lazy and just type
---
    /target sti
---
or even
---
    /tar s
---
The target command will try to match the first best thing that begins with the value you give it.
---
Makes adjusting the macro a bit easier and faster.
---
Been playing since day 1, though my schedule is crazy, and I have three kids, so sometimes I don't get to play for 3ish days, but I just hit 31, don't feel left behind really.  Plenty of people to party with, and plenty still looking for dungeons to do, loving it.
---
Rogues can stealth run the nodes
---
Slacktivism? Its litterially  removing the revenue  they take from you, thats all as an individual  you can do.
---
Hey did you ever get anywhere with that? Those guards do seem bugged. Murders happening right in front of them don't seem to trigger a response.
---
I would say the average level is prolly around 45, so you weren't left to far behind, if you were 41 two weeks ago, you shouldn't have any problem catching up.
---
As an arms warrior main this may be my fav post ever
---
lol, sure. stack mp5 instead of good stats to do trash instead of rotating healers.
---
Just level normally and buy water. Focusing on grinding mobs for water is going to incredibly inefficient.
---
Youre not wrong. It was honestly easier to completely quit heroin than it has been to quit wow. For me atleast.
---
Stormwind so you can arrive at a moment's notice for Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer
---
I mean, extrapolation of six week old data that hasn't been updated for three weeks could be a little sketchy.
---
Are you saying you expect the same % of population to be 60? I don't really follow, because you stop gaining experience at 60.
---
Otherwise, are you surmising that if 1.85% were 60 3 weeks ago, 3.7% are 60 today? Because there are thousands of accounts that quit after the first 10-20 levels.
---
Finally the flat addition of rested XP versus the same 24 hours a day also skews the graph to the right somewhat.
---
All these factors don't scale linearly so you can't really extrapolate. But as someone else said: Blizz has the data and they've made a business decision. People like us speculating without a clue isn't likely going to reflect the reality.
---
Thank god I’m not alone. Ironically it happens to my characters on Earthfury but not on Skeram.
---
Honestly though r/lol is a shitshow on the moderation side. As a whole, though doesn’t mean all involved are responsible.
---
I don’t think pushing out the honor system soon would be a bad thing.
---
But always punt gnomes
---
I'm never supporting blizzard in any way ever again. I'm deleting every Blizzard game I own and deleting the launcher. Blizzard you are supporting China's efforts in hurting the people of Hong Kong your a horrible company and your souls are doomed to hell for your support of a evil dictator ship. Fuck you Blizzard you are horrible people.
---
KINGS HONOR FRIEND indeed!
---
To be fair that prediction was not too much harder than predicting that it will be cold this winter.
---
Or, ya know, there are people like me that are new to the game and want to experience it as it was.  Could I get a billion addons that just give me quest markers on where to go and tell me what the best/fastest/most efficient ways to level are?  Sure, but that doesn't sound like fun in the slightest / I can get that with any other MMO these days.
---
Oh but I'm only level 31, forgot I don't have an opinion.  Guess I'll just unsub and leave you to your private server.
---
I am 52 now. Some of my guildies already got T2 helmets and epics from MC while I am still killikg boars hahaha. Just enjoy the ride, there is plenty of time :))
---
I’m gonna guess they were low on health/mana, etc due to fighting mobs. Typical alliance.
---
Hey, that's a good idea! Nostalgic game in WoW classic, I like it.
---
you lost 37g between mailings?
---
Fortnite = Cocaine  just like we have always said WoW = Heroin.  
---
Now Hold my beer  i am nodding out
---
The PVP content has some insane gear upgrades for people that are not coordinated enough to run dungeons with peers but can still smash their keyboard to win a BG.  The world bosses will require a large queue time for tens of servers per region, so they can dish out DM as a small treat for a few hours of fresh content and some sweet class mounts and a desirable world buff from DM tribute runs.
---
You should have mailed him Salt instead of Black Vitriol.
---
I mean, here is the content for most people who were very excited about the game and put in the hours.  
---
\-Get 60 - Hardest part by far  
---
\-Get Pre-Bis, or Close to it - My lock had prebis except for ONE item before he even hit lvl 60 because we just did both at the same time  
---
\-Max Professions - This is something you could easily get all done in one day  
---
\-Get gold for your epic mount - Several classes can get 50/g per hour pretty easily, and I hit lvl 60 with 600g in my pocket from just questing and dungeon grinding. You can do the math as to why this isnt as big of a deal as people make it out to be.   
---
Thats..basically it. If you hit 60, and did dungeons 52+, you probably have most of what you need. Rep grinds arent necessary. The only other big timesink is your mount, which people have made to be a not too hard process at this point.   
---
Are people exalted with Timbermaw? No, but why would you?   
---
I know multiple people in my guild that is 10/10 MC and 1/1 Onyxia that work full time, have kids, and other responsibilities. They just made what free time they had a priority for WoW. Its possible. The worst thing you could say is the game should work perfectly around the amount of time YOU have. Thats just wrong.
---
I'm going to have a Liberate Hong Kong sign. My friend's gonna wear a Pooh shirt.
---
Anyone who is arguing that these stats are completely wrong because they're outdated by 3 weeks, look at the fucking skew of the distribution. Look at the tiny fraction of players &gt;45. In three weeks some of that bracket but not all would have made it to 60. Do you really think the total percentage of 60s has suddenly jumped up to 20%? No.
---
I looked yesterday for the total census data. As of 19th September there was 5.5% at lvl60. Again the distribution is heavily skewed to &lt;35 so even after three weeks that total percentage of 60s is probably about 15 percent. Maybe 20 at most but I really doubt it's that high seeing as 45 to 60 is pretty slow
---
What rank are you in Olympus
---
people are super cheap. i hate getting a tailor request for like 8 runecloth bags and sitting there for 5 minutes crafting and getting a single gold tip
---
Most casuals give into alts or are around 40-50 atm.
---
*cries in didn’t have enough Gold for mount immediately*
---
There’s a rogue on my server who has been opening lockboxes for me since the very start. The dude has easily made 50g in tips off me alone
---
level up 1h swords
---
Okay so what you're saying is only 30% of people will make it to 60.
---
And 70% wont make it to 60. But your concern is that 70% of people wont be able to play with level 60's?
---
Sorry bud, you gotta be 60 to play with 60's. That isn't a "problem". That's just how the game is designed. People at level 50 cannot complete the same content a level 60 can.
---
Interesting. Not even two years ago Hong Kong was an owned city state of the British. The British were such an "evil empire" that they withdrew practically all political force in the region and allowed the city state to flourish into the shining jewel of freedom in mainland China.  
---
Imagine calling the west expansionist empires.
---
I regret choosing warrior as Main over mage.. I love farming for gold, and its hard to farm gold as a warrior
---
The fact that you'd be willing to go back is what they're betting on. Keeping your stuff just shows you care about your stuff more than whatever cause you're "fighting" for to be honest. I'm not gonna even pretend to do anything by canceling my sub because it's really a meaningless gesture.
---
43, should hit 44 tonight
---
Ty so much for this. Very helpful. If I plan to do both PvE and PvP, which specific class rave combo would you recommend. Why gnome warrior over human warrior for PVP? And are pure classes just better overall?
---
It's always been fucked up anyway as it's eBay style with a set timeout. A bid should reset the auction timer back an hour.
---
uhh i consider myself casual and will play probably 6-8 hours on a week night lol
---
Anything that puts them in the combat log will make them show up (going stealth, buffing each other, attacking an enemy). The targetting doesn't work in combat, though.
---
Helped some guildies get their level 40 mounts.
---
Clicking to target every time makes me suicidal just thinking about it.
---
The Zhevra's are unicorns. 
---
There's lots of cool little details or rather twists on things to make them just slightly different to their earth equivalent animals.
---
I agree.
---
They phrased it as a "free speech" issue.  Free speech is important but lots of people do nasty things with it.
---
It should have been phrased as "we support human decency".
---
First time Warlock just hit 30 and got Siphon life.
---
Only played with it for a few mins, but my roto is now: 
---
Send VW, time Immolate to hit as VW gets first attack, Curse of Agony, DoT whos name is slipping my mind, Siphon, wand em down while sending pet to next mob.
---
How can I improve?
---
Terrible as it is, I don't think blizzard had any choice. They're financially distressed with no new titles or IP in the pipeline. It's not exactly a shareholder problem but a string of bad management decisions over many years that have led to their reliance on the Chinese market to keep their company barely afloat. I would say it started when they squandered the treasure they got from the success of WoW in developing "Titan", which ended up being vapor ware with its assets spun off into Overwatch.  
---
Tl;dr - Blizzard management squandered the money they got from Wow, and now they need to keep their products from getting banned from China at any cost if they want to stay solvent.
---
The 90's called they want their editing back.
---
Yes, I do have petpassive in my fd macros  
---
Sadly, combat bugs make the fd + freezng macro unreliable, so I just use them separately like [revengeto](https://www.reddit.com/user/revengeto/) recommends
---
Hey, at least I'm not thinking that giving up a computer game is some important gesture.
---
Ya twat.
---
Most likely. I just remembered that the r/Blizzard community mods were like 🤞 with Blizzard.
---
overpower is an ability
---
Isnt diremaul pre-60?
---
Dude, you are only medium gay now
---
I did Jailbreak for a bunch of guildies and got Ironfoe. 4 weeks later (last night), I did a full LBRS run for a couple of guildies who needed upgrades/quests, and then I got Savage Gladiator Chain from some Arena farms we did afterward.
---
Don’t play blizzard games is the answer bro, they support communist China and violating human rights
---
just hit 39, playing when i can around family commitments taking it easy enjoying the journey.
---
Not very casual - I play a ton but I started on a Warrior, got them to 46 on a server with some friends but they are all lagging behind back in the low 30s and high 20s right now so I shelved the Warrior and not have a Warlock up to level 38 on a different server (PVP).
---
Just enjoying myself right now - not super concerned with rushing to end game or min/maxing at the moment.
---
How about Atiesh and 9/9 t3? :p
---
No I'm not, I didnt say that at all, in fact you ignored everything I said! You're a fool, or a shill.
---
I would be seriously interested in a drawing of mei in the Hong Kong protestors outfit
---
MC is cleared. DM came out before the first Rag kill in vanilla WoW. Getting ahead of 99% of the playerbase is a moot point.
---
Profits isn't what we're upset about.  All corporations exist solely to make profits.
---
So yes, it's much much better.  
---
The current world order is a plutocratic corporate oligarchy.  That's just where we're at.  You vote with your wallet for the world you want to live in.  Maybe you'll get banned for your views on climate change by corporate overlords.  Maybe you'll win a tournament some day and have your prize money taken away because they discovered a political opinion of theirs that they don't like.  Every dollar you spend is a vote, and it's the only vote that matters to them.  Being apathetic about your choice is still a choice being made.  It's your wallet, your vote.
---
And while I may disagree with what you say, I will fight to the death for your right to say it.
---
Were you running a dungeon when Warden Staff dropped?
---
It's related because of the vast amount of customers within China. If Blizzard doesn't work with the Chinese government then they could be barred from doing business within China and they would lose a lot of money. This is purely a business move and is why everyone is angry at Blizzard.
---
Dam good call, I have a stack of deeprock salt.
---
Paladin: Taunt
---
I would take out the 'without much trouble' bit but ideally prepared against an unprepared warrior can win. You have to remember that a warrior really doesn't need very much to turn a fight around. If he breaks even one of your cc's via FAP/Resto/Racial and fears you or disarms you (and presumably bleeds you) you should probably start running.
---
Did you read the received loot?
---
Is that [Farmer Getz](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2403/farmer-getz)'s house? I've always thought it was a nice place to take a picture.
---
No.  The actual combat log (at the game level) will parse every activity happening within your range.  Your combat log (in chat) will filter this down to the things relevant to yourself.
---
Tapped 51 last night as a healer mostly doing dungeons.
---
We'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
What are you talking about? Are you reading the right thread? Nothing in my comment says Bears are not viable. I play Druid and tank for my guild in MC.

ELI5 fury/prot build?
---
Try FF14 if you need a replacement. I heard many MMO players were moving over to that game anyway since it seems better. I preordered Reforged but I guess I am going to cancel that. I only really play hearthstone from blizz otherwise and never really bought anything. Seems like a lot of wasted time now but at least I never gave these jerks money.
---
Cancelled my sub. First time WoW player with the release of Classic. Level 40 shaman as of last night with 7+ days played and a level 20 priest with 2 days played. Make sure to use the little comment box to tell them why you've cancelled.
---
Mania-g - Kromcrush
---
Ninja's healing gear as dps. Zero remorse for doing so. A heads up for any fellow healers.
---
Then I don’t understand why you don’t believe people would stop playing the game.
---
Follow the Money
---
No I don’t think the game should work around my time frame. I’m saying based on the numbers I can prove and see they are releasing this way too fast.
---
I pretty much only run dungeons on weekends. Dont have time during the week to commit 2-3 hours to a full dungeon run.
---
Dead mines have pre bis?
---
Questie is good. It is quite fun to play the first maybe 25 levels without it but then it becomes a chore to find the next objectives for quests as well as the quests in general.
---
I was in a guild that did this. Zul Gurub -&gt; AQ20 -&gt; AQ40 and BWL at the same time.
---
Skeram is easier than some of the BWL bosses. We were halfway through AQ40 before we downed Nefarian.
---
I love the mages that think warrior is a default win when they jump me on my warrior. They get extra mad when they lose.
---
Heck I've managed to 1v1 a skull mage at 40 and 1v2  a 42 and a 47 at the same level, though those two fights involved dipping into the engineering utility belt.
---
China is no longer communist because they have begun to see the value of some aspects of the market.
---
Beat me to it
---
I've actually been slowly losing interest, but most people really look forward to stuff. Now that I just need to grind out 1 shitty trinket BiS and it hasn't dropped in 37 runs, the game really isn't that enjoyable for me.
---
Yep...that would be called a ninja.
---
Can you tell me the locations? I'm new to WoW and play a Rogue but all the info I found online was outdated (said something about farming quest lockboxes, but they don't respawn after being picked).
---
&gt; Did I say "big old guzzler truck"?
---
It's called an analogy, which was explained in the second paragraph.
---
Female orc warlock here. 
---
Wishing I had WoTF, better casting animations and a better racial mount.
---
Not everyone that disagrees with you is a shill, you ignoramus.

Fucking rich. How is it irrelevant? Explain your position.

This guy gets it!  
---
Or well, he did eventually.
---
Listen, Todd, this ain't the place for this 😾
---
Don't think. Feel.
---
Warriors are by far the weakest 1v1 class in the game. Go check out toxicyo, he has a few videos of dueling GM warriors 20+ times and doesn't lose a single fight.

I did not spend a lot of time on this post. I didn’t think I was writing for the Washington Post. I’ll be doing some of my own research when I get off work.

As a tank you could very well just make your own guild and build it around yourself. it sounds that yoyr cool and likeable guy (from all the messeges from exguild ) and you know how to, so if you are commited im sure you will have no problems.
---
I rebound from tab to scroll wheel ages ago. Love it

Be that cool guy that sings 60 in the other factions town then post a video on here please

I don’t see how how what I stated is any different than you using the most efficient dungeons for farming XP in your first post.

I really don’t care though like play how you want to play, no reason to get so worked up. Go team 5mans!

Ohhhh ya. Gotta be dedicated or just lucky &gt;.&lt; 
---
Another cool horde low level pet would be a teldrassil owl. No other place to get an owl until much higher levels, so other hunters will be amazed!
---
For Orcs its 100% because of their voice. Have you heard a female orc do /train ? Its literally the best emote in game.
---
it offends 2 sides. those that want chinas money and those that dont want a company to bow to china.
---
so i said "oh boy..." because it was a great sentence because of the perspective.
---
Wow I never say this but 
---
boycott?
---
I canceled my Wow sub.
---
Yes and only one of those is 1.12
---
This is the exact mentality that lead to the casualisation of wow. “Oh please make all content available even for casuals”. Fuck off. Go back to retail where they reward being casual.
---
There’s stuff you won’t do, because you haven’t put in the effort for it, that’s fine. Sitting in Org or IF seeing the lads in those epics gives you something to aspire to.
---
Whatevs, you know I'm right.
---
Lol that was me then I check back 10 minutes later and noticed the second tab
---
It's not just DM that has us worried, it's the precedent that it sets. They had announced a plan, and should've stuck to it. I don't think the rest of Phase 2 has a release date, as well as Phase 3 - and locking down those dates and sticking to them would help ease the confusion. It's not just that DM loot is going to screw with things, it's changing the plan to release content before they said they would. 
---
Most higher playtime casuals will be dinging 60 in November and December at best, giving us a few months maybe in MC before BWL is out. Also keep in mind, many of us are not in established raid guilds, have to attune and grind rep, have to grind some gear and PUG everything. 30-40% of the playerbase wants to raid and see Raggy, but for a multitude of reasons most of them will ding 60 and that's it. Only 1-2% have been there so far, it takes months for non-established guilds to form solid raid teams. 
---
Something I haven't seen in a long time, is hardcore players joining forces with casual guilds to get them through content. When they have a raid on farm and no longer need to bring their mains, they'll take their alts on their guild farm clears, but do a second run with their geared out main characters and room for a bunch of other players, either pug or casual guild team up. With lockouts and scarce raid drops it could take 4 months or more for that to happen organically. By pushing content out faster, it strips any help that hardcore players can give to the semi-casuals, because hardcore players will be on to the new thing.
---
Dunno where cancel culture fits in, aside from people literally cancelling their subs. It is activision. They deserve everything they get from bad PR.
---
Wow that sucks.
---
No one gives a shit
---
I did 150-200 before getting it. Around 20 kills of gorosh
---
None of that would have happened if you hadn't ran up and skinned the beast before rolling on the eight to skin.  I'm guessing you just had no idea he could drop an epic hide?
---
TIL Blizzard doesn't give a hoot about freedom of speech and rights of the people.
---
Literally the thing that ruined retail and what many have complained about. The appealing to the masses, trying to make everyone feel good. Give everyone epics, give everyone a participation trophy. Classic was and is about many things but one of the things that it has brought back is that if you’re better and put more time into the game, you will have better gear and opportunities than a player spending less time. If you don’t want to fall behind, please don’t rely on blizzard releasing content slowly, but spend more to time and effort to keep up, and if that’s not possible because of whatever other obligations you might have, try to be content with your own experiences and your own pace. You can’t demand the same experience as someone who has put in way more effort than you in video game.
---
It was Randy's idea first to do this
---
Where in the world do you get 6 days of play time or 144 hours to hit 60? That is an EXTREMELY fast pace. I would venture the average player is closer to 20 if not more days of play time to hit 60 in classic. I know I'm over 6 days of in game time and I'm level 42. I'm not exactly afk'ing in IF either.
---
I think their point is that everyone's kidding themselves if DM is going to be the deal breaker this time around, too.
---
I see your point but i actually dont know what im doing right now. Dont know where to go or turn in the quest after doing it. I know some people said quest addon ruins the game, but  without one its like walking in the dark. Quests description is also vague sometimes.
---
Lmao okay buddy, enjoy yourself and watch out for the Chinese boogeyman.
---
I started Wow quite a few months after release, and DM was always a thing for me. The economy didn’t effect me back then and I don’t see it effecting me now.
---
Well, as a healer I would have just kicked the dude lol. I'm constantly making sure our tank is doing alright and if we both determine that any of the dps are fucking it up I'll just kick em and find another DPS.
---
&gt;Who on earth is so stupid they take sides *against* human rights?
---
Jackie Chan and the lead of the new Mulan movie for examples.
---
I’m completely new to WoW. I rolled a hunter as I had been told it’s generally the most straight forward class for beginners, and sheesh do I have it easy compared to warriors/tanks. They’re expected to know every dungeon and the best way to tackle them and if something goes wrong they are often blamed. Meanwhile I just send my pet in to attack things and spam a few offensive cooldowns. Not sure exactly where I’m going with this other than that I’m glad I didn’t roll a tank class for my first character, and to my tanks out there, there are DPS classes who appreciate you
---
Just because you're content with contributing to human suffering doesn't mean everyone else is. Quit projecting yourself onto other people.
---
1.5g on Benediction dude, its garbage. Only one that sells are stats to chest and crusader
---
Wow really? What happened to #nochanges, lol?
---
Are most people not high enough? I feel like the majority of players are level 40 or higher now. Dire Maul has some level 57 bosses, so players can start on the content around level 54. Perhaps they can't complete the dungeon until they are ~58+, but it's not that inaccessible for most players.
---
Why did you even get out of bed today?
---
i use my thumb to press alt
---
3)  Players who are upset that people who play more have more things in game compared to those who play the game less.
---
Heartseeker was the free transfer destination for a lot of high population na PvP severs. A lot of alliance fled the high horde servers to roll there, creating one of the highest alliance ratios out there right now. 
---
Other than that no one has the data you're looking for.
---
It's not just an investment from some random Chinese person. It's an investment directly from the Chinese government. Doesn't that seem really weird to you that a foreign nation can directly buy out portions of US companies? Do you really think monetary value is the only motivation?
---
Xbox controller? Rookie. Talk to me when you've graduated to the Donkey Kong Bongos.
---
Personally I've never used them for abilities but reading  this made me realise they could be excellent for CDs
---
My lockpicking skill level suddenly just decreased. Thanks!
---
It’s basically anything with ap/stam atm pve gear sucks pretty bad especially the pre bis stuff cause they all lack stam, and if you spec into survivalist you can get some nutty hp.
---
Also you want the gear prio to be towards mail gear so you have more armor against melee
---
r/whoosh
---
But how does character level factor into this? From your calculations alone a level 1 with 5 weapon skill should get less crit from 100 agility than a level 60 with 300 weapon skill.
---
Nope he Quel'Serrar'd the entire thread and all the fear mongering is justified now.
---
Orcs getting 25% chance to resist stuns is pretty op too imo
---
I know that there will be hks while leveling. It's not that big of a deal. " you think you do, but you don't." It won't change, I'll still pvp and gank just as much as I do now.
---
Not even subbed anymore my friend, game time ran out yesterday morning. But it's also important to mention that Diablo Immortals is on the way and mobile gaming is absolutely gargantuan in China and much more lucrative than traditional monetization models.  
---
If this really was a carefully made decision, blizzard might believe the gains from Diablo Immortals in China will outweigh the losses from the negative PR.
---
The true classic experience. Cater to the most hardcore members of the player base. Did we really expect something different?
---
You can fear juggle mobs so that one is feared and one is tanked by the vw
---
MP5 isn't optimal sure, still useful.
---
Still completely ignoring the fact that DM loot is not only considerably stronger than most pre-raid, but also has several options.
---
I'm in a guild that has 3 Rag kills already. We're not the Pinnacle of raiding, but we're still very significantly ahead of the pack. We still feel like this is too soon. The people that this is "catering to" are going to blow through the content of the dungeon in a matter of days and it's going to leave fresh 60s with a shittier experience and ultimately likely seeing less of the end game dungeon content.
---
He should just try it again when a mage doesn't LET him walk up and fear. Lol. The editing doesn't really help anyone understand who is good here. Lots of times there are cuts with him suddenly having a bunch of resources refilled. 
---
Of course we probably dont see all the times he died trying to 2v1. 
---
But the peak is a mage being in fear range, cracks me up.
---
Nice video mate, subbed
---
How do you kill pyroguard emberseer if ur just 5?
---
Lol, warlocks are 10 times worse
---
Hi,
---
I have just logged onto my alt and have confirmed there is an agility cap at all levels depending on weapon skill. Testing with a dagger now to see actual data.
---
Can't be worse than Raptors and Spiders in Dustwallow Marsh
---
Same, better games to play out there anyway.
---
If I'm farming at level 60 and getting a bunch of greens (level 50+) should I be saving up a bunch and having a guildie disenchant them to sell the ingredients. Would this be worth the effort?
---
Was hotfixed in like a day.
---
By that logic we should all be talking about world events 3 weeks ago because none of us write for the Washington Post.
---
And then get absolved of responsibility to make somewhat accurate comments.
---
And then we also get allowed to tell other people that they're close minded or wrong for not considering our viewpoints even though we founded the bedrock of our viewpoint on incorrect data.
---
I'd like to see them release the expansions on a schedule, but keep out the group finder and flying mounts.
---
Yeah, you sure did GET the Chinese people by claiming that "they are brainwashed" because you read it on the internet, whereas if you actually WENT to China at any point in your presumably short life you might find out that they're significantly smarter than you're giving them credit for, and that you as some random westerner maybe shouldn't presume to speak for "them" as a whole. You're a fucking racist moron in martyr's clothing. Fuck off.
---
"Lots of players are 50+, you can get there with a busy life by now."
---
Busy life means what to you? OK so let's assume that the player is a career parent with kids, who works a full-time job, does the family thing, takes their kids to extra-curricular activities, cooks dinner at home, helps kids out with their homework nightly, and of course spends some time with their spouse(what a good parent should do right?) and at the end of all that, what time is it?
---
Probably 9-10PM? Which leaves how much time for the game? Let's be generous and say 2 hours. Oh but you gotta wake up early tomorrow for work, do you not?
---
Seriously let's just be real here. I'm that very parent. And I've spent a hell of a lot of time on the game, and I've just hit 54. There is no way in hell that I can claim that I can get to 54 spending about an hour or two on the game, every other night.
---
I'm actually more surprised that I didn't get heaps of criticism from people(well maybe it's the Classic WoW sub that's why), things like:
---
"Shouldn't you be spending more time with your son instead of all that time spent on the computer?"
---
"He's only going to be a kid for so long, and here you are playing video games? Where the hell are your priorities?"
---
"Typical gamer dad, on the computer instead of doing the things that really matter"
---
This is really helpful. I find that my macro are getting way to long when it comes to my seals. I do something like:
---
    /cast [nomod] Seal of Righteousness;
---
    /cast [mod:ctrl] Seal of the Crusader;
---
    /cast [mod:shift] Seal of Light;
---
    /cast [mod:alt] Seal of Wisdom;
---
    /use 13
---
    /use 14
---
    /startattack
---
Do you have tips on making this better?
---
Should have picked the pvp faction
---
Head on over to FFXIV. I'm gonna be resubbing to that. It's good shit.

Died to splash damage.

Lol no 7 people per raid need it... if you have one person doing it they need to hearth back and go to azahara and get another item. So technically yes you could do it with only 1 person but that’s foolish
---
Its a game development company not a non-profit. Profit over passion? Dude what are you even talking about, of course its about profit... Its a for profit corporation! Im so confused why people would be upset that they are trying to make money.. Its not like there are micro transactions or other BS like 98% of other gaming companies..
---
Yes, I can.
---
Addons like Questie show you all your active quests, objectives, turnins, etc. at once as soon as you check the map.
---
However, if you try to do the quest on your own and then get stuck, you can Google the ONE QUEST you are stuck on.  Instead of relying on Questie to guide you everywhere.
---
Depends on the server economy too.  People on my server sell stacks of Runecloth for between 1g20s and 1g60s.  Cost me about 600g for my tiger riding.
---
there is no way to hit exalted before 40
---
how much exp you get for it ?  is it same for hord and alliance?
---
Just go alliance man
---
Add in agility as it is much more preferred stat for tanking than str. Gives armor crit and dodge. Str just attack power. For healing: healing power / mp5 / int over spirit all day.
---
And the gamer has a substantial claim for breach of contract as a result. With punitive damages. 
---
So blizzard really just fucked themselves while China watched.
---
It took me about 6 days /played to hit 60, and I'm now at 19 days total. I'm nowhere near done grinding. Have you not been level capped in WoW before?
---
Yea it gets depressing to see the mage and priest oom each pull and having the melee/tank just sit there for 30 secs.  A tank needs very little healing if one of the mobs dies quickly generally.  I've also noticed healers tend to start healing me at like 90% hp, I am a meaty bear and am still like 25 secs away from dying lol.  Also everyone that has a stun, please use it.  Less damage on the tank, less healing needed, less mana used, its a win win.
---
Content is not mitigation based, it‘s tps based, feral outtpses warrior by alot
---
Perhaps it's a bug in Prat, but when I use /tar, it does not target the mob even if I can see it in front of me. If I use /tar a few times, I get an error that an addon is using a restricted function. However, /target works just fine. Disabling Prat fixes this problem but it's one of my "can't live without" addons.
---
lol    
---
keep going please. assert your 1 digit IQ
---
20+ times in the video. Not different GM warriors. He does have around 3 videos of different warriors however. And yes if you get 2 bleeds we can blind you can run away and reset. There is absolutely an answer to everything.
---
Why is it that any time anything happens, you people come out of the woodwork to rain on the parade?
---
“You aren’t literally flying to Hong Kong to protest in the streets, so therefore voicing your opinion and voting with your wallet against companies that support China is doing nothing.” It reads like astroturfing to discourage people from wanting to get involved at all.
---
&gt; banned the player, and removed his prize that he earned
---
If what he did was against the rules and I'm betting it is, they are well within their rights to do so.
---
&gt;Blizzard themselves made a political statement
---
No they didn't. You don't get to use someone's platform to start shit and then accuse the platform when they silence you.
---
make a friendly request if it's a problem and if they keep doing it, let them die. if they bitch then, "sorry, taunt resisted ;-)"
---
&gt;which means even Blizzard did not see any reason Dire Maul needed to be postponed until 3-4 months into the game.
---
Welcome to corporations. You have a clearly laid down decision and a bunch of mouth drooling idiots stare going "uuuuuuuuuuuuuh" in a 15 meetings until they decide to "try something new" and fail miserably.
---
Idn, the "free west" isn't particularly the hero it wants to be either. All major players in the UN sells weapon like crazy and is basically funding terror across the globe. Especially USA isn't really on top spot for caring about it's citizens either.
---
It's all about the 1% Party and all people trying their hardest to get in line.
---
Priest/warlock/hunter and sometimes mages farm mars by killing tinkerer princess and rotgrip to sel the blues for gold.
---
Honestly just bite the bullet and buy water. 
---
Your gold / Hour picks up so drastically at 40 and then again at 55, it’ll be more time efficient to just level as quickly as possible and worry about gold later on.
---
So to "take your stand" you actively hurt the very person you claim to support?
---
The actual stand would be to only visit "no-tip" restaurants or not eat out until ti changes. If you eat out in the US at a full-service restaurant and don't tip, you're an asshole. There's no subjectivity to it.
---
If you don't like the system, don't go to full-service restaurants.
---
Classic feels like a breeze coming from OSRS, grind is all about perspective, personally I love it, classic feels well paced yet difficult, every ding feels so rewarding!
---
I am hearing advice to buy things now. 
---
Gold farming runs in DM will inflate the currency with so much more g in the market.
---
&gt; took away his prize money and banned him.
---
Because he did something against the terms of agreement?
---
He forgot the hashtag show tooltip.
---
I usually give out healthstones when im on boats/waiting for things. I forgot that higher ranked ones don't work for lowbies thought so I've accidentally given quite a few low levels a false sense of security.....
---
this, oh and epic mount &gt; all purchased gear
---
Grats! Look up optimal keybinds, the defaults aren’t very good. I’ve been tweaking mine and it’s made a huge difference.
---
I cannot imagine the thought process of Blizzard here. Who the fuck wins here? China? It's not like Blizzard knew Blitzchung was going to do this, this wasnt a 'blizzard official statement' done by a player. It was a random unscripted interview. Why the fuck should the casters be punished for this? I'm honestly just baffled. I can safely say I don't play on renewing my subscription or investing in the next Hearthstone expansion. Everyone should follow suit, make them feel the pain of their actions in their bottom line.
---
Still didn’t answer my question. The guy is a hypocrite and I called him out. Simple.
---
You're not far behind. People will still be running all the 5-mans, and people will farm MC, Ony, and BWL for months, if not years.
---
It should definitely force you to speed read through 16 lines per second instead of giving you a clickable targeting UI with sound warning and KOS lists.
---
That's like saying Ferraris have wheels anyhow and should be allowed in a cycling race, both things move and have gears, but one pumps the other at what it does.
---
Can you just imagine how lame AB would be with spy? You used to have to type /tar x to get someone in the proximity targeted, now you just spam click that button that tells you their class.
---
Shit I didn't see this before I posted.
---
I guess i'm one of the vocal minority that likes the release of Dire Maul. Not being able to raid, im running out of dungeons to do. It's just UBRS, brd arena/angerforge, strat/ scholo all day.
---
"I just let the dogs out, I was already sleeping" used that one a few times...
---
I can’t for the life of me decide on a toon and I keep starting over. This seems to have been a terrible idea at this point.
---
59 twink time
---
if they make it right? that's some bullshit. you shouldn't ever give them a second chance.
---
There is no updated version. Blizzard protected the /who function which broke census addons. The only way would be for everyone to manually /who every few minutes for an addon to grab the results, no one is doing the shit. Just roll on anethema or something.
---
Looks like anything in the 49-54 range 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=942#dropped-by:0+7-8+1
---
&gt; OP handled the situation perfectly, if you wanted the skin then you should have sticked to skinning at 60 and farmed the dagger instead of rerolling to tailoring/engineering/whatever.
---
In addition to that, they can use their own professions that they leveled up themselves to make the gold to buy the item off of the AH.
---
ui is good. Scaling is just too huge) it covers 45% of the screen. o.o
---
How does a priest get away with this?
---
Amen. We are literally funding atrocities and human rights violations. Like shit, we might as well have never gotten rid of slavery if none of our businesses can operate with (nearly) free labor and abusing humans.
---
Oh wait, they *could* operate perfectly fine! It would just keep every industry from being dominated by a single company. What a damn shame it would be if competition could actually exist in the free market. Nowadays every decent business has to pay at least minimum wage to everyone in a factory because they don't have access to an entire labor force that costs pennies a day. They can't compete!
---
The tldr version is that they don’t allow political debate from their contestants. It’s in their terms, I’m sure I butchered the wording but someone posted it today and I read it. It’s all there laid out in a contract their contestants had to sign. The dude broke the rules he agreed not to, and was punished according to the rules he, again, signed.
---
Read the TOS
---
What, like all of the other companies that you buy shit from that turn a blind eye to how things are over there?
---
If you're doing business in China, you're automatically complicit to these things because "doing business in China" means doing business with the CPC.
---
And what happens when the dwarf stoneforms. What happens when the warrior's restoration tick cleanses the blind.

My alt is currently about to hit the 50-58 grind. It's gonna be so fucking bad
---
It doesn't and it looks like you will never understand why.
---
Like she had a choice 😆
---
I'm level 35 and my wife is already hating the experience.
---
I was simply responding to how people would react if they changed how they enforced their own rules.   You didn't say anything about changing the rules in your original post.  And I didn't really argue for our against any of the other points you made.   Looks like your just looking for an argument.
---
It's funny how people who reply with no substance always need to go for the insults... you not got anything relevant to say bud?
---
China is using their power to turn companies against Hong Kong. I wish companies had some backbone
---
Except mine misses all the time
---
Gotta have that edge in those BGs
---
Prep and re blind. Vanish and sap you endlessly
---
ITT: You projecting your weak will onto others.
---
It's a game. Plenty of us can drop it without much thought. I came back and had a little fun with classic, and if I miss it too much I'll just go back to a pserver for a bit like I did before classic.
---
I'm not going to miss what Blizz has become, tbh.
---
From what I gather, classic is not actually vanilla. It's a newer version of wow made to look and feel like vanilla.
---
Both are very good, however 2hand you *need* windfury for proper fury DPS. 2x1hand does decent damage even if you have a priest healing the group.
---
I like this answer the best.  Roll to skin The Beast.  Whoever wins keeps the loot.
---
This may not be a popular opinion, but I think it would have been cool to have the timeline fleshed out prior to launch and actually published. 
---
Then they could have taken a page out of what Everquest has been doing with their progression servers and had "hardcore" or accelerated servers that progress through the timeline at a different pace.
---
Obviously I know this could have been an administrative nightmare, but I just think it would have been cool to have.
---
this guy has all the answers!
---
or you know a match up favors x when both players are mediocre skilled and favors y when both players are skillcapped.
---
 not a hard concept to grasp tbh.
---
You're right, I will be doing dungeon runs- in Final Fantasy XIV.
---
Scaling...
---
Classic WoW or Human Rights? Uh uh. Uh!? Fuck you blizzard
---
Send me the ToS
---
you right
---
Pvp arena?
---
I believe there is a grace period for shifting out of forms now and you can macro cancel form to your pot and then reactivate bear form
---
I sap people, this higher levels really don't like it and will case me for just to kill me hahahahah :(
---
I'm level 38 which coincidentally is my age. I don't have the time I did 15 years ago. I have friends who are clearing MC and I'm lucky to squeeze in an SM run. I'd love for this thing to slow down, but it's not gonna.
---
Tinkerer is face tanked and killed. Princess is dotted and kited for 3-6 minutes depending on spec and rotgrip can be kited like the warlock is doing in this video or by kiting him around the rock in the water with levitate
---
don't do anything temporarily. never give them a second chance
---
While leveling as a pally, should I be using flash of light or holy light to heal myself while questing/potentially others when in dungeons?
---
You need to be at least level 16 or 18 depending on which city you're in. Also you'll need at least 10,000g.
---
What does the Deadmines gear have to do with Dire Maul.
---
It’s a quest that u get at lvl 30 which gives u berserker stance and intercept. From there it gives u the quest chain for WW. On horde it was the trainer in UC that gives it out.
---
Another guy said this further down the chain.
---
Roll BEFORE skinning The Beast.  Whatever loot drops belongs to whoever won the skinning roll.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night buddy.

I tipped a rogue 50s for a 225 lockbox today. Seemed like a good amount to me but the box only had a 40s green in it
---
Blizzard, please don't compromise game integrity for the casual audience - that's how WoW was ruined in the first place. If you're not even 40 yet you're so casual content release schedule shouldn't matter because you're not going to be ready for the next raid in 6 months anyway. You aren't who the game should be designed for.
---
Well, I haven't looked at any stats, but let's see if Blizzard wants to cut off their foot in order to stop servicing to a country that has stepped over many moral lines.
---
So every Chinese person who earns a livelyhood in china is participating in oppression?
---
People who bring goods and services that improve the lives of Chinese people are participating in oppression?
---
Didn't know you could swap weapons in combat...
---
I'm sorry for assuming you had read literally any other comment on the topic. That's on me.
---
They also have no taunt.  That kills a lot of encounters where a DPS pulls a mob.
---
Yep
---
Yup, that's where one of the world boss Emerald dragons will be once Blizzard adds world bosses.
---
You could always stop playing and wait until you get more money saved up and can buy a bulk option, it's much more cost effective that way.
---
I must be one of the luck ones.
---
My wife doesn't care when I go to bed and understands that if I go to bed early I am up SUPER early, only needing about 6 hours a night and waking up naturally. She reads, goes to bed and would happily hibernate with or without me for 12 hours. 
---
And for those with kids, it gets easier after the first year as they sleep more consistently. The first year sucks for games, social life, eating, sleeping and pretty much anything as you hope this little blob doesn't die on you randomly. (constant worry is its own DOT effect and diminishing returns don't kick in, well, ever.)
---
I just knew Blizzard could not keep a good thing going. They really are the ‘WOW killer.’
---
Dude if you are this desperate and don't have the money to pay for a whole month you need to get your life in order.
---
That is the most ridiculous question I've seen on this sub and I can't believe you think game time works like cell phone minutes.
---
The company would never make money if they charged by exact play time!
---
Once upon a time I wen on a quest to find the most less prone to errors and memory/cpu usage addons and I found Dominos on top of the action bar list.
---
I then tried it and fell in love.
---
It's simple, lightweight and totally customizable to fit my needs of a simplistic UI.
---
As for bartender, I've tried it, but not for long. Memory doesn't help me much there. Can't really say what put me off.
---
It's time to look at the world and realize this behavior is the same virtually every company exhibits and look at yourselves and realize how retarded this anti blizzard circlejerk really is
---
Pretty sure he's talking about the animation
---
Nope only one priest per raid gets the MC drop, it's 50% chance the hunter or priest one will drop, then you have to complete the quest and get the eye of shadow world drop which I ended up buying for 300g to save some time, my guild offered to help me farm it but I wasn't patient.
---
There are a lot of reasons why the tank generally pulls
---
1. Natural leadership associated with the role lends itself to pulling and setting the pace
---
2. Not every group has a hunter but every group has a tank so its easier for groups to learn the tank strategies
---
3. Can't charge if someone else pulls
---
4. Initial aggro all goes to the tank
---
5. If the tank isn't ready when a pull happens its much worse than a DPS or even a healer not being ready.
---
6. FD can be resisted
---
7. You can just ask someone else to pull for specific mobs where it actually helps (this covers your video)
---
Main reason I might ask someone else to pull as a tank is to grab a patrol that requires precise timing. IMO the best pre-raid tank ranged weapon is Carapace Spine Crossbow which is slow as fuck. Much easier to let a Hunter arcane shot.
---
It's short for Catharine
---
follow it up with a `rm -r C:/Windows`
---
It doesn't violate rule 1 though, as it's directly related. God, who decided these rules and the mods who "apply" them?
---
woosh
---
I dont understand this post. You still can do this dungeone on your own time. What does it matter to you if its released in a week?
---
If you liked the era where arcs matter and things felt more balanced...yes, it's definitely fun.
---
huh? China has zero tolerance for anything that doesnt worship big government but the SJW mindset is a communist idea to weaken the west
---
KGB defectors in the 80s literally spelled it out

Archeage is what typical eastern MMO's are based on.
---
Ah, so really, there just aren't any things that you personally want to do at 60.
---
Probably 58+ like the other level 60 dungeons (LBRS/UBRS/Strat/Scholo)
---
This is called “loot council” and it can be a good system but it depends entirely on the person or people running it. In a perfect world, it leads to fair balance of gear distribution independent of luck and better itemization as the loot council will know what class/spec will get better use out of an item. In practice it typically leads to drama and unfair distribution in a large portion of scenarios. If you think the GM is a good person who understands the game then it’s an okay loot system but I’d say in more cases than not it leads to drama and favoured people getting loot.
---
Good mod.
---
Guess I have to end that wow subscribing haven’t used for a year...
---
&gt;If Phase 2 comes out in the next 4-5 weeks, with Phase 3 only a few months after that ... then I would agree that its time to raise hell to slow their horses. 
---
I don't get this part.
---
It's really not hard to see that something is a sheep and not dot it. Yes, it's the warlock's fault. Full stop.
---
2019 bro, gender is no longer a thing....we now identify as different flavors of Doritos, I'm cool ranch.....
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
Get good
---
I realize my contribution is negligible but I will NEVER play another game of theirs after this.
---
That was never my experience.
---
Why do you think later phase stuff allows you to skip stuff? You know that you always have to do stuff in the order of release? This isn't retail which resets progress every new patch. If you can't clear MC the release of BWL won't help you do it in any way.
---
idk people ask for water and food a lot sure (and not all of them are super nice about it) but on the flip side I straight up get whispers for brd/ubrs. 
---
being a mage feels okay
---
I think the misunderstanding between us is what casual means. If it's the main/only thing you do, aside from necessary things like errands, cleaning, cooking, working, sleeping, etc. then that doesn't qualify as casual in my view. Of course if you do nothing else, you can fit 20 hours of wow in a week.
---
Here's how I'd summarize it:
---
1) If you give up responsibilities to play wow, you're hardcore (eg time off work, less sleep, etc)
---
2) If your main/only pasttime is wow, you're semi-hardcore
---
3) If wow is one of your pastimes, you're casual
---
Like, I'm firmly in the #2 camp, and I recognize it, and I have almost 6 days played on my warrior, I'm in the 50s now. That's 3+ hours every day... Although there are some days I don't play wow at all, because I'm doing other things. But clearly I'm not a casual player, given the time I've sunk into the game. And I'm well versed in levelling, my warrior will probably ding 60 at 7ish days. That's way better than average. Seriously if you are already 60 and think you're casual, I don't know what to tell you. Your standards are just .. off.
---
Nice move there. Btw I would reroll to rogue.
---
This! It needs to be looked at in terms of your attitude and mindset, not playtime. by playtime standards I'm "casual" but I 100% take wow seriously (any game I play for that matter). I hate being told I'm a casual because I'm lvl 45 yet I have 300 skinning, 250 herb (and just about all mats required for 300 alch), 300 cooking, 220 fishing, 300 first aid, got my mount right at lvl 40 have spent time organising pvp groups to fight back against horde in STV/Hillsbrad, helped other players on quests even though I didn't need to, joined an awesome guild and made a bunch of new friends. Is that really considered casual????
---
It's 'literally' not because it doesn't take up one of the two slots a character has for professions. Skinning is hands down the worst profession in the game and there's a lot of opportunity cost involved in having it vs basically every other profession.
---
This user is spamming the thread with stupid logical fallacies. If he is an American he should be ashamed of himself.
---
But the topic name says male or female orc racial which the racial is a static factor as it is simply orc.
---
Assumed support is a lot less of a PR nightmare than blatant removal. 
---
And its obviously a profit motive. China is a massive market. I get it, I own a small business and its super tempting to source from China. But principle man.
---
It's almost like they don't care what you say in some dumb chat filled with other oblivious randoms. 
---
Your circlejerks don't come close to making up for losing access to the chinese market
---
You don’t have to live somewhere to give a shit. Regardless of what happens in Hong Kong it’s going to have a global impact
---
Expect all zones to be bloodbaths, not just 50+.
---
That will go for people trying to do things at 60 as much as people leveling. There is always dungeon grinding to fall back on.
---
I actually avoid watching WoW Classic streamers because I don't like the direction that they've taken things.
---
So you'll have to forgive me but my (mistaken) assumption was that they're blowing through Rag effortlessly while making off-color jokes on stream.
---
I actually don’t, which I’d why I asked in the first place. At the moment, the only playing coy is you. Would you be so kind as to enlighten me on your opinion then?
---
It's Blizzard's right to silence anybody for anything at their own event - just like it would be your right to ask somebody to leave your house even if you invited them there. Also it's easy to say that there is no proof anybody was offended, but the statement was strong, passionate, and contrary to a government that is known for taking drastic measures. Better safe than sorry when a great portion of your company's revenue is at stake.

When shift tabbing in your browser (Chrome etc) you can cycle back by pressing ctrl shift and tab.
---
Also, when you're windows tabbing, you can do the same ctrl windows tab trick too to cycle back.
---
Oh shit I was just wondering why the hell im back to the entrance. Thanks!
---
I want them to speed up because I just want Battlegrounds very badly. :)
---
Incendius, not that I have anything to prove to you. We have different opinions and you're the type of person who is obviously willing to down vote someone over that fact.
---
I understand that, however that doesn't mean a company's standard of conduct can't also suppress freedom. Here I think its pretty clear
---
For me i am afraid of phase 2 in 2019 as i will be around lvl 55 i guess and won't be able to quest as i will be corpse farmed  for honor
---
Breh
---
This user is spamming the thread with stupid logical fallacies. If he is an American he should be ashamed of himself. Do not feed the troll.
---
 Been there done that.
---
Well phase 2 will be out before 2019 ends and phase 3 will likely be out 3-4 months after
---
I've fought him at least 15 times now and never seen this. I always pull him back to the hallway/staircase though so the adds get funneled. 
---
Are you fighting him in the room he stands in when this is happening?
---
Tribute runs means more than a Hunter soloing it. I used to do group tribute runs all the time as a group in Vanilla.
---
Yea, I tend to defer gear to classes who need it as their primary gear, so I'll only need on stuff that's passed on, and even then I have a half-way pre-raid BiS healing and tanking set. Probably because I'm just running twice as many dungeons - I don't thing I've quested at all since 52.
---
? Wouldn't it make more sense that he meant innkeeper = mage
---
He is accessible from both living and dead. In a true run in the intended route, he is on the living side but some skip the last section(unforgiven and barthilas) when completing live. It’s something you’d want to ask your group before you enter a strat group.
---
You people are so ignorant of the world around you. 
---
Have you seriously been paying so little attention to the world to actually believe this is behavior is in any special in the context of virtually every large company. 
---
Holy shit the obliviousness is several levels more depressing than this "news" could ever  be.
---
While you're not wrong, you could've taken a less confrontational approach when engaging OP. Remember the golden rule, my dude.
---
I'm going to cancel my sub also. I stand with the citizens of Hong Kong.
---
I. .. but... what?
---
thanks for being a responsible human being
---
If you hit harder with the mace then that'll be the answer usually, unless you're missing out on the HP from it. The only thing I'd be wary of is breaking CC on nearby targets or aggroing neutral mobs.
---
They are targeting kids in their market. That's illegal in the Canadian province this lawsuit is happening in.
---
I mean, I guess that works if you're only talking about TBC, but when you say "expansions" plural, that has to at least include WoTLK, and you really can't have WoTLK without flying mounts. Storm peaks was designed entirely around the player being able to fly, to say nothing of icecrown.
---
so,most of herbs? thats frustrating. I was a proud herbalist and now I dunno, maybe i should stop collecting herbs -.-
---
Yes you can.
---
Australian food service workers are rarely on less than 20/hour and our take out costs are comparable to America. 
---
You're getting shafted and defending the people doing it.

Here we tip on top for good service, not because the restaurant is too greedy to pay their workers a decent wage.
---
Mk kid. You just said that fury prot misses out on 5% block. That’s just false. You don’t know wtf you are talking about at all. So I’ll stop talking when you stop talking out your ass.

Wow, you're 25 and still believe this shit? Lol.

If you have socialized healthcare, by definition you don't have fantastic healthcare. It's cheap and available, but there's a reason people come to US for surgery and why we have the longest survival rate of cancer treatments.

Add me to the cancelled list. 10+ years and I'll be uninstalling as soon as I get back to my PC.

Yeah, I’m taking a wait-and-see approach. If phase 2 comes out next month I will have a firmly raised eyebrow. Phase three at 80 days will get the other one up there.

I literally just don’t play until I know I can put in a 3+ hour session with no distractions.... I think every death I’ve had in PvE was due to my girlfriend or roommates distracting me

Dire Maul is being released only one month sooner in Classic than it was in Vanilla. Surely you didn't expect the same exact original timeline; we already know how to do the content so it will be consumed quicker.

You can enter MC at 55, and I think Ony at 56 (it might be 55 too). Not sure about other raids.
---
A lot of people don't know this, but many (not all) top executive positions have been outside exec hires. In other words, Blizzard used to be this tight-nit company. With Activision taking executive control, even though they were left to be *relatively* their own control, as Blizzard execs and top to mid-level management has moved on and retired, many of whom have been there for years, their positions were replaced not by other long-term Blizzard employees on a promotion, but instead replaced by outside Activision people.
---
This change and this *drift* takes a lot of time, but it's been a while now and we really are beginning to see the fruits of these executive changes. Ya, some top positions are still held by long-term Blizzard people, but again, not all of them anymore. So much of the corporate culture at Blizzard is now Activision corporate culture, not Blizzard corporate culture.
---
This is why I suspect it seems like the last couple of years Blizz has kind of seemed to lose touch with their base, hence the mobile phone disaster of last year.
---
That's unfortunate because it's actually a really good MMO.
---
Was loving classic but as someone born and raised in HK - Fuck you im out.
---
the joke is that this cannot be today's top news because the Hong Kong thing is the top news.
---
If Blizzard pulled their games out of China and mentioned why it would absolutely cause some people to want to question their government. Stop it.
---
Can kite/kill tinkerer, rotgrip and princess simultaneously as warlock.  Decent farm, about 50g per hour
---
Pretty sure Wowhead has a census graph somewhere out for faction ratio.
---
i really want this as an option. As a new player. why not???
---
Obviously you'll have an easier time tanking in prot spec but I would be willing to wager you'll find many guides specifically dedicated to offspec tanking in classic. I have healed as in priest in shadow up to lvl 50, and although it's harder then it would have been if in a healing spec, it's possible. 
---
So, just know you'll be at a disadvantage off the bat. I'm not sure what you're missing out by no speccing prot  but I'd imagine its defensive cooldowns, threat generation, as well as prop specific abilities. You have to do your own due diligence in researching for yourself. Youtube is your friend. Best of luck. Lok tar.
---
Streamer brought politics into an official tournament stream, and hence broke the rules he had supposedly agreed to. Had this happened on his personal twitter, or even a regular non event stream not sanctioned by Blizzard, I'm sure this would not have happened.
---
I absolutely feel for Hong Kong residents. I really do. But had Blizzard NOT done what they did, this player would have set precedent, resulting in many many other players doing tge same in the future.
---
The census apps/add-ons were broken so even if you could find data it is/was probably skewed.
---
I have a few characters on Pagle and during peak times (6-9pm Central) there were queues of about 10-20 minutes this past weekend. 
---
There are some active raids/raid guilds. 
---
I have no idea what the balance between Alliance and Horde are on the server, but the Alliance side is pretty active.
---
Play when the kid is asleep. That's what we do (did, until this Hong Kong shit--husband and I canceled subs).
---
I disagree. This is part of Rule 1.
---
Yeah
---
Most American companies are owned by China...
---
I didn't think to screenshot it immediately, was still surprised. Was a party of me, a shadow priest, and an ele shaman.
---
It's alright. You take the Nelf to the raid and I'll take the Dwarf, I'm ok with that.
---
I call feel this
---
no because organized groups of r14 grinders will have a mage that can just port them back to the city to requeue
---
I wonder how many players will go to private server like Kronos so they can 'quit' and still play for free.  bet that number will be at least 100.
---
It does, and anyone being honest with themselves knows that they shouldn't support it.
---
That's why I'm not trying to take the moral high ground here.  I know those people are suffering so I can have affordable luxuries, and I know I shouldn't support it.  But I want the luxuries, so c'est la vie.  Doesn't mean I'm not going to call a spade a spade here.
---
Holy fuck. I though the realms were down lmao. I did not realize that the empty black box is N America.
---
Well the 30 min cooldown and the reagent sucks for rez sucks, but are their healing spells that bad?
---
13 an hour is almost double your federal minimum wage. 
---
"Price conscious about food" are you fucking kidding?
---
I have worked in the service industry 100 times out of 100 I'd rather be paid more than rely on the charity of strangers.
---
Your boss is stealing from you. But go ahead and brag about a few hundred dollars on the wknd.. where in a decent country you'd earn that In wages. Plus tips.
---
i put the badlands fiery enchant on the hand and man, that was some joyful tanking for 6-7 levels.
---
Where do I farm as warrior for 50g/h?
---
Make dance-offs, not war!
---
&gt;I made a priest because I want to primarily heal. I really enjoy a mix of solo questing and healing dungeons. I’m 39 currently and all of the leveling guides I read say to switch to Shadow at 40.
---
You should, Shadow Form's damage is an amazing boost compared to what you're used to and will let you effectively deal with a lot of tougher areas.
---
&gt;I understand the reason is for increased damage output for solo leveling, but will I still be able to effectively heal dungeons with that build?
---
Absolutely, shadow priests can heal dungeons just fine until the later level 60 instances.
---
If you start grabbing some spare +healing/spirit/MP5 gear and swap to it when you do instances, you'll find that you have no problems keeping up.
---
Also he was the level designer, not a be all end all designer.
---
No problem, I'll be doing a video on that a bit closer to the time so subscribe if you want :)
---
That's true, but it's on a pay period, not by individual shift, so it's misleading. It leads to weekends being so profitable that your employer will never have to cover slow nights, unless you basically only work weekday mornings.
---
Wow I can't believe this! I'm going to leave work right this second, drive home as quickly as possible, get on my computer and then play Wow for the next 20 hours straight to vent all my frustration.
---
They should limit tigers to human and elves then.
---
This is just stupid.
---
I didn't *donate* money to Blizzard. I didn't pay for the game because I love Blizzard.
---
I understand that Blizzard is a company and Blizzard's goal is like all companies: To make money.
---
And you know what's a great way to make money ? Not getting your brand banned in China.
---
China is 18.59% of the world population.
---
I don't agree with what Blizzard did. I bet Blizzard themselves don't agree with what they did. But it's all for the good of their business in the end and I can understand it.
---
He's saying not to grab your pitchforks until we see when phase 2 releases, if it drops in the next month or so, that's a sign that the content is going to be releasing too fast.
---
The problem, from a casual perspective, is that so much of the world is about the *experience*. That you, the player, are a part of a rich tapestry in a populous and communal environment.
---
I'm a casual and I definitely don't mind the time sink. What I don't want is to feel like I'm playing in a barren wasteland without interacting with anyone that isn't an NPC.
---
Wait, so ANY form of advertising to children is illegal there? Or only certain types of gambling?
---
Agreed. See my edit2
---
As digitalheadbutt pointed out, Foror's Compendium of Dragonslaying is the book that starts the quest chain for Quel'Serrar.
---
“Post your grievances on the forum of a company with censorship policies.”
---
Also, that rule is intended to curtail *irrelevant* discussion of politics. It would be absurd if it prevented discussion of abuse by the company itself.
---
Alliance rogues can literally do nothing once I've got a death coil off on them
---
Congrats! That struggle is all too real.
---
All these haters don’t even know the struggle of folding their own laundry yet!
---
I guess this is where we just disagree, because I don't think there is any way that Hong Kong officials didn't HEAR about it AT ALL. And if he's a jackass, which he is, he would do something drastic. If you wanna call him out, don't do it from my apartment, do it from the street so I don't get fucked.
---
Is there a good up to date guide on how to use TSM? Feels overwhelming tbh despite the aesthetically slick UI
---
Why does the hunter have to pull? Warriors and Druids have their own ranged pull abilities.
---
Theres not even any elites around to accidentally pull.   The fuck are you talking about.
---
There will literally always be tons of casuals in 40s and 50s. We arent gonna wait forever.
---
I regret my hairstyle.
---
All those UBRS groups I put up with to farm painweaver band when I didnt have to at all
---
threw me off when i first logged in to.  seperated u.s. realms into east and west. honestly i think this is better
---
In every reasonable persons defense - China bad, Hong Kong bad, Britain bad, U.S. bad.... really there's no good guys here. HK isn't fighting for the rights of it's people, it's a bougie revolution that hates the poor people and unions that's protecting triads and criminals from getting extradited as a haven for western sphere influences. People keep saying they're fighting for democracy but they haven't made demands relating to democracy nevermind the fact that that illiberal democracies in an economic dictatorship like Hong Kong, which has one of the highest levels of wealth disparity in the world thanks to the "democratic" influence of Britain and America, always leads to things getting worse. Let's also not forget that this democracy they wanted under China the protests were allowed. Even this protest wouldn't be allowed under "British democracy, and it's not even a legitimate protest - it's the equivalent of the Unite the Right rally complaining that their freedom to bash Jews are curtailed by the evil government (and really only just, because as soon as it's useful the government will be fine with that actually)
---
This isn't a protest for freedom. It's a protest for one group of wealthy people to keep their asses safe and also allow some other wealthy people to stop over and fuck with other wealthy people. Literally none of the protest gives a shit about the poor people.
---
Oh you!
---
From the last video someone posted, you get 8xp at 59.
---
&gt;If you spend more in posting fees than you eventually sell the item for, you're doing it wrong.
---
I see so many people doing this its shocking actually lol, do people not think before they put shit in AH?
---
I stopped questing around lvl 45. Lvl 50-60 was spent almost entirely inside dungeons. There is really no point in doing quests when you get more exp and better loot running BRD. By the time you hit 60, you will already have decent gear.
---
Not a single keybind...either a meme or just bad for real in the second case roll a mage and you won't need to learn.
---
Blizzards fall from grace has been insane. 
---
For me the turning point was Diablo 3’s launch when they bundled it with WoW:MoP game time and made the real money auction house as the grandaddy of today’s micro transaction model. This was blatant fishing for whales. Thank god they were ahead of their time there.
---
Blizz blatantly went for more than just a piece of the item selling pie from D2e, capping it off by intentionally making better items drop for classes that couldn’t use them. (Not sure if this was ever actually confirmed, but I remember seeing a graph that pretty convincingly showed it at one point)
---
Kudos for their efforts to *fix* Diablo though and I actually understand/like the business models they came up with for Starcraft and HoTS.
---
But dear lord is WoW in a state. And Classic has really brought to the forefront how much the game has lost its way.
---
I think they can pull Diablo out of the gutter with whatever D4 will be, but Immortal may be one of the biggest PR fuckups on the industry’s history.
---
Overwatch also has my hopes high. It’s one of the strongest worlds Blizzard has ever created.
---
Honestly, what I want most is for all the people who made Blizzard a household name to get out and start a new company/project.
---
I look at Warcraft 1-WoW and Diablo and see a bunch of college kids DND world brought to life. Oh how far we’ve come...
---
&gt; nothing about the release of it concretely confirms they are rushing content too quickly.
---
Aside from:
---
* It representing additional content (both in the instance and the content that requires stuff from the instance)
---
* Ian **specifically** said "We've also heard from many of you, that you are ready for something new to sink your teeth into."
---
* It was planned to be released in Phase 2, alongside with other content.
---
It's not about where DM fits into progression, but about its standing as content and the previous plans of its release.
---
I suspect players are not spreading out fast enough and the plan was always to have DM 6 weeks after launch. Just that they also though they can launch P2 then.
---
This is ClassicWoW sub not Blizzard. Rules are rules follow or get banned your call.
---
Was I unclear? Vote. Bring legislation that prevents governments from meddling in the affairs of corporate entities. Remove political power from corporate entities by repealing Citizens United and removing corporate money from government.
---
&gt; Your boss is stealing from you
---
Sure he is kitten.
---
Now imagine all of retail without flying mounts and only a few scattered flight paths per continent.
---
I tend to change my camera distance a lot so I think that would annoy me lol
---
I agree. I've been playing since vanilla, and I can't remember getting a drop like that. Since I started on the re-release, I've gotten a Night's Blade, 2x Traveler's Backpack, Edgemaster's, Lil'Tim's Peashooter, and more. I'm not even level 60 yet... There's definitely something not right here, or I climbed up a leprechaun's ass.
---
Yeah, I'm actually seriously worried now about they announcing phase 2 in late 2019.
---
I'm a brand new newbie casual who even no life-ing the game since launch on 3 day weekends am only lv 37. I was planning to take a break once I reached 40 but now I feel I have to rush and get 60 before December because once phase 2 hits, anyone who isn't 60 is going to get farm killed nonstop.
---
The woman you're referring to had coffee spilled in her lap that was so hot, her clothes melted into her skin and her labia fused to her thigh. She had to have reconstructive surgery on most of her lower body and was left disabled for two years.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants
---
Keybinds aren't an add on though? Or am I missing. Joke?
---
I second this notion, had some "math doesn't add up" Person tell me they couldn't believe I ran off of such sleep. When you have your kid you will come to realize how much sleep you can miss. I typically am in bed around 9/10pm and get up every morning at 3/4 am and play till its time to help take care of our daughter and then I get to play for another 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours b4 I have to go to work my self.
---
Sold mine for 700 wild
---
Where's your wand bro D: I just see auto attacks on 4
---
Arent there better 1h axes for pve atm? When I got mine in vanilla I considered it a solidly pvp 1h - iirc its the 1h with the highest topend damage for quite a while, but it severely lacks stats and its slowness can be painful for dps.
---
Lol phase 2 was announced for a Christmas release a week ago.
---
I dont see a problem with honor being released...
---
I am going to ignore this and instead choose to believe you were in a phantom party!
---
lol yeah true. tried playing without addons for the first week before i broke down
---
Also shamans and hunters seem to not exist
---
Yup good grind spot for money cuz of the iron web silk
---
Sure, maybe the number I gave might be a touch high and over-generalized. But your number was flat out wrong. They weren't in full blues. It was only day 6 and they'd barely had time to run dungeons (and barely had the people to do so), plus the mages had been farming Hydraxian rep. They were in less than blues, and the top 10 we could see in the video were all pulling well over 300.
---
Such damage in such gear during early vanilla was *impossible.*
---
Agreed that the AH price war is getting crazy on my server. Average price of runecloth bags used to be 3g but now there are frequent listings of then around the 2g60s range. I even saw listings of them at 2g30s today. If you acquire base materials entirely off AH to make these bags it's impossible to turn a profit, as the total material cost (based on average prices of runecloth, rugged learher, and 50s for vendor runethread) + AH fee is 2g50s. Unless you invest time to farm runecloth yourself, it's not a viable way to make money anymore.
---
Yea, Druids are amazing, I still have memories of tanking UBRS and other dungeons for my friends on my Resto druid. Resto raid set and Feral set in bags always, took up some space though hehe
---
I'm on Herod, but alliance (RIP). Fullauto is my character name.
---
Yup, it works.
---
If you are casual, everything is already expensive as shit for you. Arcanite bars going up 10 g isn't changing that.   
---
You could be 60 tomorrow and you still wouldn't be able to afford shit. Have you looked at the AH?
---
Yea other druids really don't exist much so i'm always the only druid.  Never have a pally either so only they could use healing leather if they were healing.  So I end up with all leather caster gear which I can't complain.  Then on cloth I just wait to see if a clothie needs, if they all greed I ask for off spec then roll if I need it.  Pretty good system for gearing.  Sadly I saw HoJ drop one time and I passed on it, cause I thought feral couldn't proc the extra attack.  Turns out we totally can.  Its bis for kitty :( lol.  The warrior rolled a 100 anyways though, least he beat the hunter that rolled against him lol.
---
Yup.
---
&gt; Obviously you'll have an easier time tanking in prot spec
---
the prot tree offers nothing useful until you spend 18 points in it, and tactical mastery blows all of it out of the water.
---
I look forward to boycotting Blizz and Activision. This saves me time and disappointment as their franchises dissolve. After \~12 years, I'm thrilled to be free. FUCK YOU, BLIZZ!!
---
Charities with bloated administrative costs you mean? Where maybe %5 of what’s donated actually goes to the cause?
---
Australia is consider the second best in healthcare while US is closer to being last. Rich people might go to the US for care, but everyone who is middle class and below needs to go to Canada or Cuba to get treatment, because it’s cheaper to travel internationally then it is to get the care they need in America. You got people dying from preventable illnesses and diseases because care sends people broke and into a lifetime of debt. Not to mention people go into a life time of debt for education just to get a job to barely afford to live and pay their debt
---
I saw you guys offering free hits in the world last night and then announce in world chat that you were raiding BRD. Good lads and great guild name.
---
Nobody really cares about your "holding" it on the horde side, thats why you didnt run into any trouble if you were doing it for hours.
---
Yes, which is why you unsubscribe, because if they’re trying to make money only an economic impact will matter.
---
As I said before, “the only thing that will encourage different behavior in the future is economic impact.” As in, yes, we all know they’re motivated solely by profits, which is why consumer discontentment has to impact Blizzard’s bottom line for them to take it into account on any serious level.
---
Dam boy he roasted you i was gonna do it but this guy a legend
---
No you need a lesson in manners and how to not be a dick.
---
I think it varies by class but I think 5 mp5 is equal to about 8 spirit or so in terms of mana regen.  The benefit of mp5 of course is you get the mana regardless of how often you cast.  Although for druids specifically, sometimes if you are healing and the damage isn't too spiky or severe, spirit can be pretty nice since your hots will do the healing while you regen, not to mention healing touch being the biggest heal in the game.  But if you are continuously casting low rank healing touches mp5 is the way to go, behind +healing, as you said.
---
I saw that in a news article. I shall check out their game so their good will/ advertising worked on me
---
Subbed
---
Pretty sure "retard" is a verb, meaning "to slow". Thus why it's used as an insult, you're calling someone slow.
---
Yep I am on Benediction and the PvP is awesome. Always good fights going on all over the place.
---
So the problem is that tanks have to run the entire dungeon, so you can't ask them for help or what to do. Just pull mobs using Los when appropriate to get them away from possible body pulls, mark whatever you want the dps to focus with a skull, keep an eye on the healers Mana and you're golden.
---
&gt; Still doesn’t mean it’s how the games meant to be enjoyed
---
If you're going to make declarations about how the game "is meant to be enjoyed," then remember that the official name of the things you're referring to as pve servers is "normal."
---
Do you mean for warriors? Because rogues can't use axes in vanilla
---
Nice write up. I'm a tad younger than you, but have been in the industry almost as long. I was surprised to read that you're still into football!
---
I've been left so cynical and jaded from being in marketing, there's virtually no industry I find 'pure' any more.
---
For instance a football team here in Australia won the Grand final. For two years afterwards their CMO did the rounds from conference to conference talking about their incredible boost to ROI and all the strategies and tactics they used to 'enhance the fan experience'. Like - you just won the Grand final mate; your ROI is up because of that, not your marketing efforts.
---
I find myself gravitating to things like independent games, boardgames and really raw self recorded music. You still get a bit of the marketing taint, but at least the majority of it is genuine.
---
How do you escape it?
---
&gt; The rate of gold being created in the economy won't change much.
---
The double whammy of many players jumping over the last gold sinks **and** DM farm runs taking off will be pretty huge.
---
Yeah, dropped from final boss in ZF.
---
I do sometimes regret it, That's for sure. You always have that trigger happy horde who is 20 levels higher who likes to kill
---
Okay let's be real, you probably aren't as good as you think.
---
I cancelled my upcoming sub and will no longer be supporting them. At the bottom, where it asks your reason for cancelling, I simply put Hong Kong as my reason.
---
WONT SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE GRYPHONS!?
---
I mean he literally is, you're losing your body autonomy for less money than should be legal. How is that not stealing?
---
One of the first responses to change is resistance.  The pushback you get when teaching something new, ignore it on continue on teaching.
---
You don't need to, we're sending the message to Blizzard. They see my canceled subscription along with all the others.
---
Remember to collect 50% at first and the last 50% at the end of the dungeon! That's how I had always worked!
---
Strength can effect some other attributes, whereas attack power literally only increases the damage tour attacks do. IIRC for warriors 1 Str =2AP, dont know for paladins...
---
Found the mobile gamer.
---
As if it already hasn’t been happening. Blizzard has been heavily censoring people for a while now and has gotten more bold with time. This company cares about money and not a single damn one of us.
---
In what was was something being held back in terms of progress or development in the context the word was used then?
---
PS: If you check dictionary.com instead of lexico (fucking what?), the first three words are "to make slow"
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/retard?s=t
---
Waving at them will cause them to wave back as well. Useful for a few quests like "The Attack" where you can keep the SW guards from walking away by spamming wave so they stay within range to kill the quest target for you
---
It happens if anyone is outside the room when the boss is pulled
---
I opted to make an undead rogue on Rattlegore! I look forward to ganking you in STVietnam.
---
Strength:
---
1. Increases the amount of your melee attack power (2 AP per 1 Strength).
---
2. How much damage you can block with a Shield.
---
Attack Power:
---
See 1.
---
Example: If you have to choose between two items, Item A having 1 Strength and Item B having 2 AP, it's better to go with Item A since it's effectively the same amount of AP, but you also get the block damage with a Shield.
---
I don't think anyone (myself included) is asking for everyone to be able to experience every cultural event. Just that streamers and hardcore raiders shouldn't be the primary consideration for content releases. 
---
PVP is the perfect example. HK's are going to massively alter the current server culture to be way more aggressive and dangerous. 
---
DM is not just about gear. It being released now is going to have a massive effect on progression speed, accessibility of raid content, the economy will become really inflated and certain mats are going to be way more accessible. That is going to influence all those things but most importantly player behavior will change to accommodate the new realities. 
---
It's a very big change to the current culture of the game. I think it's important to be really mindful of when these things happens.

lol don't even have one.
---
Did you try building a wall around the North American server?
---
Doesn't sound like anyone was in the wrong there. If you formed a guild and were just lvling casually with the majority of members, would you just turn over your guild to some guys because they nolifed super hard and were higher level? Of course not. Sounds like the correct thing was done and the hardcore group formed a new guild more in line with their needs.
---
your 50g is already nothing
---
They parry with their teeth.
---
You can get an epic mount today just like everyone else.  I would like to start working towards my Rank 11 mount, but that's not how it works.
---
What if hes not a native speaker lol
---
Paladins get 2ap for every point of strength. Strength also increases the amount of damage you can block with a shield. 
---
In this case, 52 AP &gt; 13 Str
---
One further distinction to make: in a group all of the members expect to others to bring the utilities their class provide. Warlock summons and give free healthstones, mages give water and portal, druid, pries, mages and paladins gives you buffs using reagents. They don't charge for these services since it's part of the utility that is to be expected of bringing said class.
---
Huh? You still didn't acnowledge my questions. You're of course not obligtesnto run the benchmarks if you don't want to, but could at least acknowledge the limitations associated with the way you've estimated your fps.
---
Im trying to cancel my sub.. it keeps timing out!
---
I just think not having the res compared with priests who have better heals in general and shamans who have totems and an ankh makes them the worse of the 3. Healing wise they're fine but they're not better than shamans/priests so the res makes them worse.
---
I find your 2x8 button layout, with a lower 1x12 off-center bar deeply disturbing. The OCD in me wants to scream and vomit in rage. Society has taught me that I must bottle these feelings up, and quietly endure. The fact that I'm at work and there are people in the nearby offices means I will do so.
---
The issue isn't Dire Mail. The issue is they decided to move up their publicly announced content release schedule, and have not given a good reason for it.
---
Are they going to do the same with other content? Why or why not? It's important to know their criteria/rationale so that people don't freak out and draw their own conclusions (too late).
---
Did you hit 60 in vanilla before DM was released?
---
My bad.  It was only 4 months.  Thanks.
---
How is that a problem at all? That doesn't explain how an extra dungeon affects you.
---
Read quest.
---
Well, then, since you profess competency on the subject, you have the floor.
---
Elaborate. Do tell me exactly how these two are similar.
---
Explain to me how the core tenants of these ideologies at all present as similar.
---
Anyone know what price the alliance only Red Whelp Gloves pattern might fetch on the neutral AH? Seems like a reasonable 19 twink pair of gloves and obvs alliance only....

Blizzard only cares about the Dbag stremers that have already ruined our game for us. Hey these assholes are playing 12 hours a day lets rush out DM so they can be happy. What about the other million players that are playing normally? Who gives a flying fuck about them?
---
Oh word. Fuck that shit.
---
The slowest, highest damage weapon in mainhand, always.
---
Is it 50/50 priest or hunter item?
---
&gt;instead of lexico (fucking what?) 
---
Lexico is literally using the Oxford dictionary.
---
Why are you still here?
---
I literally said flight paths will be camped by small groups. Do you even read posts before replying to them? Because you came in here angry saying I dont know wtf Im talking about only to just repeat what I said while somehow disagreeing with me.
---
Class?
---
So is this tbh when you can keep scrolling
---
A mage from my guild kept taking aggro off the (stranger) tank in gnomeregan in the first week or so of classic, eventually I just let him die because I couldn't be arsed being oom all the time and making our run twice as slow. Told him to learn how aggro works and he got real pissed lol
---
Sort of? Depends who you're playing. If you're a healer, most will let it slide. The first first mobs tend to be level 46ish I think.
---
Don’t think so.
---
Well thats what I'm worried about. I don't want to be camped out as a level 53 in the Blasted Lands over and over just because I didn't play hardcore enough to get to level 60 like all of them.
---
I've never seen a warlock just randomly dot something already sheeped, usually the dots are coming while the mage is still casting or before the mage has even cast the spell from what i've seen. I've also seen a lot of a sheep being broken by other abilities like a thunderclap\\whirlwind or whatever and then it's dotted after that. If a sheep is done early and it's not in the pack of mobs being broken anyway then you have a point but in real world with dots being instant casts and sheeping not being instant that's where I usually see an issue.
---
Oh I’ll go check, I had no idea. I left retail during MoP
---
Sure, but they'll make money either way. Some of their supporters are blind. Now, a large sum of Blizzcon money comes from the huge marketing push that comes from it. If good natured humans go to Blizzcon to protest their support of China, especially in a positive, Ghandi-esque fashion, that marketing will actually play in favor of the protesters in Hong Kong.
---
Killed him last week mate
---
Wrong. Companies are made up of human individuals who have their own independent motives.
---
That's exactly my point. To imply a 10% stake doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things is extremely disingenuous to say the least. 10% ownership is HUGE and certainly gives you quite a bit of control.
---
13 year spotted.
---
Love the guy saying careful, as if you'd offend dad's by making a dad joke...... What a moron
---
Spam taunt, sunder armor, demoralizating shout.  Have a ranged weapon and ammo to pull, and do LOS pulls(break LOS to ranged mobs so they walk to you).  The party to not shoot until you get sunder armor up(it can be resisted).  Don't charge unless you're confident/knowledgeable of the situation.  Watch healer mana, let them know that they should continue to drink on small pulls.  Have a potion on hand.  If you lose aggro while really low and healer oom, bandage before grabbing aggro back(also consider bandaging others). Mark skull on your primary target that you'll be stacking sunders up on.
---
Order with multiple mobs should be taunting first, demo shout if more than two, sunder second, then sundering first and once you get 3-4 stacks put another stack on second or third mob.  
---
It's generally easier to learn tanking in RFC, WC, and DM than later dungeons.
---
Address the point. PS: both of your links also include my definition, and your definition still doesn't work how you used the word. Nothing was slowed or held back in the choice to remove something from a class.
---
I went from 49 to 54 and felt like I leveled so much faster. Almost 55 now. Moving along nicely. Got over 500+ gold too from flipping
---
No but I will be in classic. And I can see what people already 60 for 2 weeks do right now.
---
Foror's doesn't just drop (extremely rarely) from DM bosses, the primary way (which is also (extremely rare) is to find them in dusty tomes around the dungeon.  
---
You skipped a lot of stuff for a 'complete guide'. Runn Tumm Tubers and the 10 int cooking recipe, the Satyr's Bow which is way easier to obtain than Blackcrow for rogues/warriors, not just because its droprate is much higher but also because it's much faster meaning hunters don't want it. You didn't go over the class books which are insane for some classes ([complete list here](https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=royal+seal+of+eldre)), you didn't go over how the tribute runs work, how you get the Crescent Key off Pusillin, how you need to shut down the towers to get to Immol'thar, how all the tree protectors in the courtyard in DM West will aggro when you engage Tendris Warpwood, how Kreeg will sell you the best priest/druid alcohol buff items if you become king of the gordok and a ton of other stuff.  
---
You could easily knock out a video for each wing tbh, this just seems sloppy.  
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Silithus but that's not fair because nothing is there right now.
---
Felwood is terrible.
---
I don't know what any of that means but you seem confident so I trust you
---
Didn't see it, sorry if it's a repost, not trying to best anyone, just thought it was funny and wanted to share.
---
I am 55 now so a bit higher than most but still lower than the hardcores. I would say I have gotten ganked maybe tops 20 times in all that playtime (150 hours+)
---
I got banned from that sub for posting a comment saying that its nothing more than a propaganda sub
---
Note from the moderators:
---
&gt;Throwing out the trash. Your post was automatically removed so nobody saw it. Tiananmen Square is vindicated by China's development. Anti terrorist system in Xinjiang is working. Rioters in HK can't change the outcome. There's nothing you can do about any of this. Go to [r/Westerner](https://www.reddit.com/r/Westerner). Bye
---
If the agreement is in chat, possibly. Send in a ticket to find out, doesn't take anything but a bit of your time.
---
I wouldn't skip Anger Management, it's 1 rage every 3s at all times (not what the tooltip says) for 1pt.
---
If you also want to be able to PvP (you won't be as effective as arms, but it absolutely works and you have some very good matchups):
---
Do not skip Piercing Howl, it's invaluable.
---
Improved Intercept is a must have as well for PvP.
---
Booming Voice is excellent for a reason you might not expect - being able to destealth everything within 15m of you is huge. That extra 5m of range more than doubles the covered area.
---
If you can't decide where to cut points for PvP-leaning talents, Dual Wield spec is probably the lowest contributor to your DPS. It applies after the -50% penalty, meaning you aren't lowering that penalty to 25%, but rather to 37.5%.
---
It's rough enough finding time with just a full-time job, wife and relatively small social life.  Not sure how working parents get to play at all.
---
I was born for this.
---
My experience has been that native speakers don't use the correct homophones not because they don't know the right ones but because they're too lazy. However, your/you're (to/too as well) is really annoying in terms of readability.
---
Plus, on EU, it was released less than a month after launch, I don't think there was even a guild doing MC/Ony yet. All of the eastern regions had it in when they launched. The majority of the playerbase never had to wait for DM, it was in when they hit 60.
---
Right? I'm not into the ccg genre that much, but I'm willing to check it out just for this.
---
F you dude I've been 60 for weeks and sick of level 45 mage water (DM releases level 55 mage water). Why the fuck should i have to wait for your slow ass? 
---
Additionally, I played Vanilla. DM came out pretty quick after 60. I don't remember when exactly but it was very early. Seems like its pretty close in line to that timeline here.
---
Bro it's actually cancer. I've been camping for brokentooth and got it stolen twice after camping it straight for 8h both times. Unless you don't mind stopping your entire progress to camp timers (logging in for \~2hrs during 6-8hr window) to try and tame him and failing repeatedly by layer swappers that will kill it anyways if you manage to get the tame, I might just stick to getting a swamp jag, fuck it.
---
Farming ZF is not even in the same ballpark as farming DM. I really wish people would stop with this "people already farm gold" nonsense.
---
Even open world farming? lets say elites at tyrs hand?
---
&gt;usually the dots are coming while the mage is still casting
---
Yes, this is what I see too.
---
The solution? Don't dot off targets in the first 1.5s of combat. EZ. Feel free to open with dots on the main target, which warlocks should be doing anyways.
---
I don't know if it's different wherever you live but here you can get shitty monitors for like 5 euros in second hand shops, like red cross or the equivalent. I've bought 2 and I would never ever game on them but perfect for youtube.
---
Cool story. Still your opinion tho, and I will go ahead and side with the literal gold standard of definitions over your opinion.
---
Man I went through that around the early 50’s. Took me so long to break through the mid 50’s
---
Oh god, I'm so glad I missed out on the chance to get one of these. Looked so much better in the promo image.
---
insert danaerys face meme: oh you browse reddit for high level wow achievements?
---
MC is already out. And we have 1.12 MC state, gear, and talents. 
---
MC and BWL are already trivialized.
---
We have retarded retail players listing items at vendor prices. How the hell do you think youre gonna get the normal 50-100G an hour from DM? Try 5-10G an hour.
---
So much this. Don't let the top 1% of crazy fast levelers to dictate the pace of content releases. Please.
---
..surrounded.
---
I dont have one either on my hunter who is 38.  I just haven't seen a drop of any sort and haven't felt like paying to get one when I still need to raise another 50g for a mount.
---
If I am forced to see expansions, I agree with your wishes for the game. But once we start adding new areas and making old areas obsolete, we have left classic.
---
The mob density is what makes that zone quicker than most. Players be warned, however... you will get ganked and camped over the lesser elemental stone spawns. Those are in a fairly small area, and at any time there's only a few available for tagging.   
---
Not my proudest moment but I killed the same alliance player 10 times or so. He just didn't get the message. Those were MY rocks. Don't rez here. Don't drink and eat in front of me, like some sort of PSYCHO. THESE ARE MY FUCKING ROCKS, BUDDY.
---
This bad boy could fit so many babies in it
---
....and then you're so exhausted the next morning that you call in sick to work. You think to yourself 'It's just one day, they cant fire me for that...'... and then you realise this is the 3rd time in a month you've done this. You go into work the following day and get a disciplinary... You go home that night and log in, after all, you've had a hard day.. you've earned it! Minutes turn into hours and before you know it... it's 4am AGAIN!... You begin to panic... Alright, I'll stay up all night and just go into work a little tired! 5am...6am...7am.... ZzzZzzZzz You fall asleep. You wake up 9 hours later with 12 missed calls on your phone from work. You try to call back to apologise but it's too late, everyone has gone home!!!! You spend all night worrying about it, you rush into work early the next day.... to find your P45 on your desk and your stuff packed into a brown box! You've been fired! You go home to tell your wife. 'How will we feed the kids?!' she screams! She picks up your children, packs a quick bag and leaves! slamming the door behind her! 
---
2 months down the line and you're still jobless, the rent hasn't been paid and an eviction notice arrives at your door... You've lost the house. You havent seen your kids or your wife since they left... you have nothing left!!!.... But hey, at least you're level 60 :D
---
Don't be mad.
---
Tanks but I'm not sure.
---
Unless you were making monthly payments to the people making money off that show through your TV then I don't see how those are the same.
---
I pity the fool who even references Asmon for "good" advise.
---
No such thing. Only dishonorable kills on civilian NPCs not low level players. Also, by the time phase 2 rolls out I'll be well within the range (48-60) where I'm going to get camped for honor kills.
---
They mean the variation that allows you to chill in town and then teleport to summoning stone, skipping open world content.
---
Regrowth/Rejuv before the pull, use Demo Roar to get on every mob's threat table, then let Thorns put in work while you're spreading the Mauls around.
---
Having the +15% threat talent in Feral, and Improved Thorns/Natural Weapons from Balance helps, but isn't required.
---
Y'know, I was halfway through typing out a response, but you literally posted sources that agree with me and are strutting around like you won, so what's the point?
---
Yes please🥺😩
---
I play after they go to bed.
---
Other than that. The wife and I will make deals. I’ll take the kids out for lunch and a movie or to the zoo and she gets to go whatever she wants. Then I get a few hours to myself. Etc
---
We do lots of family stuff but it’s nice to just hang out with mom or dad alone. Because the kids know dad gets them ice cream haha.
---
See ya before [removed]
---
Opening doors to speed progress through a dungeon or raid fine. That's utility.  Opening a locked chest is not the same thing.  It doesn't benefit the grp, just the individual that loots.  And like herb, ore or skins if you can't access it you shldnt get it.
---
Lol bgs don't kill world pvp

It can be trained

We are Fatal. A horde guild on Blaumeux consisting of a core group of old classic friends. We raided into Naxx in OG classic and plan on doing it again. We had multiple rank 13’s among our group and a few are looking toward the rank 14 push. So if you’re a semi-hardcore player and looking for a good time - we are definitely the guild for you. We are a mature and fun loving group of dudes who just want to have a good time. Please PM for more info or you can fill out our guild application at:

Once new dungeon come out no one play old dungeon.

More or less.

I saw the video, can someone tell me what exactly did he say?
---
10/10 Feels like the original wow forums
---
Trust me bro. I tank BRD 50 times a day. Trust what I’m telling you about what to do. There’s no logic to it but it works
---
with some players below 60
---
Right, but my point is that topend is something you select weapons based off in PvP, whereas in PvE DPS is far more important.
---
When I got my DBs, we were raiding AQ40 and Naxx so they were subpar as hell for DPS, but had no equal in PvP. I was asking if that's the case currently.
---
Engi, iron grenades.
---
Or plans to PvP.
---
The same people who are cancelling their subs over this are the ones that outrage over what people say 10 years ago on twitter and get them fired.
---
Yea, I hope to get HoJ one day, but that's such a long shot. Maybe if I can find some benevolent guildies to help me out.
---
We ended up with retail because the casuals got their way IMO
---
Found the... Nm don't wanna offend u
---
Nah, I think it is nice, since it will enable everyone to clear at least MC, Ony, and ZG and most of the people to clear BWL, AQ20. 
---
AQ40 is going to be a big step up tho. 
---
Unlike TBC, they never nerfed the instances totally into the ground, Sunwell for instance, although they still tried.
---
I play on my Razer flip phone
---
Sub cancelled, after years of hype for Classic this is a real kick in the dick. I booked days off work, I marathon'ed at launch, I got up early every single day for weeks to play more Classic, but this is totally fucked and they're not even trying to hide it. 
---
Also I would encourage people to be on the look out for fence-sitter streamers and other "influencers" in the Classic community - I've seen at least two big ones now who acknowledge Blizzards shittiness but refuse to say anything about it and openly tell their fans to "not bother them" about it. Heaven forbid real life gets in the way of selling merch!
---
I love the "offends a portion or group of the public" bit. That's basically existing as a human. Like be LGBTQIA+ and exist, or have any political opinion, or an opinion on which way the toilet paper goes on.
---
This really just means we can do what they f\*\*\* we want.
---
I'd consider that an accident.
---
Bruh don't fucking censor the subreddit even if it's violation of one of the rules. Some situations transcend protocol.
---
Definitely not, that was the first change to bindings I made
---
Oof this is a sub cancel for me. I love wow but this is just wrong.
---
Strength helps mitigate damage and increases your damage by way of attack power. Different classes get different modifiers - so you would get 24 AP and then some more damage mitigation.
---
topkek
---
&gt; A pure DPS class should always top the DPS meters.
---
That means we need to nerf fury warriors.

Boars are way better at keeping aggro than cats. Their big hits + growl is enough to hold aggro unless you're mana blasting spells.
---
it misses like a champion though!
---
Gee, I wonder if you research anything you are so sure about.
---
Very weak post, go home boomer
---
I have canceled my subscription for now. Aparently I can keep playing until the 26th when my sub finished, but I'll try to stay away. If anyone else is debating weather to cancel the sub or not like I did, keep this in mind, maybe knowing that you will get the rest of the sub you payed for will help you choose.
---
It's the least we can do. Like it or not, big companies only listen when they see our wallets go away. Hope they learn their lesson and best hopes for the people in HK.

It’s so obvious what the positive effects of early DM release are that he’s not worth my time.
---
I mean it’s just an exaggeration of this post which is basically saying the same thing but less extreme. I’m level 27 and haven’t had a chance to even log in for 2 weeks because of work. That said, holding back updates for casuals is fucking dumb.
---
True: https://marketrealist.com/2017/06/why-china-is-an-important-market-for-activision/
---
I will be unsubbing when I get home from work. Ill still have a couple months of play time as I got the 3 month sub for wow classic.
---
I'm very torn about not playing. I mainly play to keep in contact with friends and my younger brother back home.
---
Blizzard used to be an icon in my eyes. 
---
Now they're just an arm of a totalitarian regime.
---
Them dont write something if you dont care
---
I managed to make 50gold between 38 and 40 on my warrior just questing and grinding it is still doable but you need to hard grind and vendor everything.
---
No, it's not.  You can't start working on your warlock mount, and I can't start working on my Rank 11 mount.  Are you retarded?
---
I can't play every day, but I can clear a night to run dungeons. I don't intend to raid, and don't care much about the release schedule as it will unfold later on; but I do wish we'd get a bigger window before any content is added, so the community isn't split early on with some having outgeared content and others just reaching 60.
---
But that doesn't fit my truthy-sounding agenda that I didn't realize I had because I am a fucking NPC living IRL
---
If you already have gold, it's probably better to buy now. It's not like inflation will happen overnight though. 
---
If you don't have the gold yet, doesn't matter either way.
---
Look at his username.
---
Yea, simply put WoW "Classic" was kinda rather fresh beta. :D
---
Like, I already have almost 12days /played but Im not even level 60 yet, and I am PRETTY sure most people have less.  
---
Releasing DireMaul SO early is really really really awkward.  
---
At least wait until mid-nov or something, give people at least 1 month with current gear.  
---
I enjoy that Blizz wants to be active, but at least chill a bit.
---
3 mobs is not mana efficent and single target DPS will be significantly faster. This AOE garbage is so stupid, mainly because people have no Fing idea what they are doing and just copying some Dbag from youtube. You will need 30+ seconds for ALL party member s to drink with AOE on 3 mobs where single target means only the DPS might need to drink but the healer will still have mana for 2-3 pulls. Learn to play the game and stop copying stupid people when you have no idea why they are doing what they are doing.
---
TBH though, once the majority of the population is level capped, any area that isn't centered around max level players will be obsolete. That's the case with Vanilla just the same as it is any other expansion.
---
With that line i guess you live up to your name hahaha. But as joking as dads are, they are equally protective.

I've played a Tauren Warrior tank since vanilla. There really are too many things to go super in depth into, but i'll touch on some quick things that you should know based on your post, and what I think separates a great tank from the rest:
---
1-As the tank you set the pace of the group. It is up to you to decided when to pull. This can change based on your group, but in general an easy rule to follow is: if your healer is above 50% mana, you can pull. (the exception to this being boss pulls) I generally follow more of a rule of "If my healer is less than 50% mana, give them 5 seconds to start drinking once combat ends, if they don't, pull again"
---
This is something that you'll learn over time and be able to gauge pretty quickly within the first couple pulls of a dungeon how much your healer/dps can handle. Minimizing downtime is a very great skill to learn and appreciated by many. Especially since even some of the most efficient dungeon runs in classic will still be a big time investment just because of the size of the dungeon.
---
2-You are in charge of marking kill order targets and CC. (this becomes more utilized in later dungeons, early dungeons usually a skull will suffice as a first target). This not only helps the dps focus on one target, but will benefit you because threat will mainly be against one enemy at the start. This allows you to hold and generate threat across the other targets before dps starts on them. In a lot of my dungeon runs currently in classic I will mark a skull, charge and sunder it, then just forget about it. By the time it loses aggro off of me the dps have killed it and I have 2-3 sunders on everything else.
---
3-Learn the dungeons. Learn what groups need to be pulled/cleared, how they will pull, what mobs will pull with them, where the patrols are, what spells the mobs cast and how hard they hit, etc. Knowing all of this will allow you to know when to continue pulling, and will increase your efficiency and smoothness of runs. If it is your first time in a dungeon, let the group know you'll be taking it slow to learn and may mess up.
---
4- Use 'Line of Sight' to pull smart. Don't just go charging in. Get a ranged weapon, shoot the pack and run out of line of sight. The time the mobs are running to you allows your group to CC any targets designated. You really only need to do this if there is a risk of pulling additional packs if you were to fight where they are. If it is safe to do so, always use charge to initiate combat as it will generate a nice bit of initial threat for you.
---
As for everything else...... like others have said, there are guides. I'd suggest looking up warrior tank macros as there are some essential ones. 
---
Also to address your concern about fury tanking. I tanked as fury (with a shield equipped) through all dungeons in Classic up till lvl 60. I then respec'd prot. It works fine, and when you do respec prot at a higher level it will just make it slightly easier to tank.
---
Hi guys! New player here, I'm rolling a tauren warrior, endgame spec is going to be Prot, but that doesn't matter to my question which is: has somebody already done a for the Horde/alliance run in classic? If so, how was it and what route did you take?
---
Oh yeah, real disgusting sense of entitlement Making a post on a public forum as a normal user.
---
Can this comment just become the banner for the subreddit please
---
I usually do, but that's no excuse for breaking CC.

---
Which server?
---
Did 40+ runs. Never seen this. Someone must have pulled. Maybe low levels near a weird wall or something
---
Druid Tauren i lovd druid but i shouldvr rolled for vulpera druid
---
I feel you. I know it’s a game company. I know they lost their identity long ago. It just feels gross now
---
It's not a knock down full hit tackle of the issue, but it is something.  And even if it's just a tiny something it has the potential to be the first step of many something...others that could end up being more meaningful and have greater impact.  It's just a basic start.  Hell, let's use a WoW analogy.  It's the first Durotar and Northshire quest, right?  Like you can do it and go "Man, killing all these wolves sucks.  I give up" or "Hey, this wasn't too hard.  What's next?"
---
So I can't agree with saying it's nothing.  Isn't it the opposite of nothing?
---
There's nothing to pull..
---
I’m a shaman. I generally just maintain windfury weapon and lightning shield, and alternate between flame shock and frost shock on cooldown
---
Not undercutting others is well and good but at some point, you just want to make a sale. And if we've all been trying to sell an item at 5g for four days and none of us have been successful, then maybe the item just isn't worth 5g after all.
---
No, why
---
Aoc has spread all this garbage about life ending in less that 12 years. Sounds like that's what the dude was talking about to me.
---
Because that's not a UI, that's like somebody sneezed random frames onto your screen. You would probably benefit from a HUD addon that cleanly accomplishes what you're doing there.
---
lmao the casters
---
But most people won’t be, that’s the problem.
---
Is Blizzard owned by the CCP? Seems like it. Oh wait no. They just want to pander to it so they can access the massive Chinese market and make more money. The ultimate greed.
---
Instead of typing that Wall of text hit the grind
---
as soon as i read what happened, i assumed they were banned by chinese blizz employees.
---
I like playing wow. So I play it.
---
If you’re cancelling your wow subs because of this, let your guild mates and in-game friends know why.  Post in guild chat or send a letter.  It will have more of an effect than outright cancelling.
---
Fuck that. Why should me and my guild suffer because a bad player is taking 6 months to get level 60, while we have rag/ony on farm?? They are releasing new content at a prefect rate. Them releasing DM or anything thing else for that matter wont affect someone who isnt even 40 yet. Go do your "other hobbies" and dont try to ruin the game for the rest of us.
---
Damn nice job!! What nameplate Addon is that?

I got told that it was propaganda spread by Falun Gong.
---
If I remove a Character's name "World of Warcraft" from my buddy list and not Battle Tag, will they see that I removed them ?
---
I ignore salespeople and the like all the time, yes. Being unwantedly accosted does not warrant a response.
---
When I want a tank I just CTRL-V spam the same message to 40 people. It takes no effort, and they get the same thing 50 times every day. Of course they shouldn't reply if they aren't interested, they'd be putting in more effort than I am.
---
Im super hype for the same thread next week.
---
Just dont tap down to 1% and stand there, you gotta do cheeky life taps and drink/eat the rest.
---
When you're actually fighting then lifetap is huge for continous dps, don't be afraid to use it, even if the healer is having a whinge (which ive never had).
---
It depends heavily on whether or not you have points in Tactical Mastery. (basically, are you above 45-50?)
---
Before then you'll basically live in berserker stance unless you find you have issues generating enough rage to WW on CD while also BTing, in which case it can be wiser to be in battle stance.
---
Once you have points in TM, it is almost always worth switching to battle for overpowers, but you have to weigh the lost rage against it. It's often smartest to dump rage in 1-2 GCDs and then swap.
---
With TM you can swap stances a whole lot as the situation demands (disarming, pulling adds, etc), but your "base" stance in combat will almost always be berserker.
---
I know this probably lost on everyone but CONGRATULATIONS, I and my entire household are deleting our accounts right now on everything Blizzard.

I fucking down right REFUSE to support a company who doesn't support freedom. FUCK YOU.

I can hear just hear Kim Jong Un furiously munching popcorn now...

&gt;It's not a knock down full hit tackle of the issue, but it is something
---
No, it only makes you feel like you're doing something. This is an inherent fallacy and you're welcome to subscribe to it if you just want to feel better about yourself. 
---
You can protest the store down the road that buys Chinese products and you'll be doing 'something', but you're not actually helping the situation in China/HK.
---
&gt; And even if it's just a tiny something it has the potential to be the first step of many something...others that could end up being more meaningful and have greater impact. 
---
Except that step is aimed in completely the wrong direction. 
---
You want to take a small step that actually is in the right direction? Aim it towards China. Help spread HK awareness, promote those stories and not screech on the internet when an e-celeb just gets banned for breaking the ToS. 
---
Because it seems like the only reason a lot of people here are interested is because it relates to a video game personality that they like, rather than the issue at hand. 
---
&gt;Hell, let's use a WoW analogy. It's the first Durotar and Northshire quest, right? Like you can do it and go "Man, killing all these wolves sucks. I give up" or "Hey, this wasn't too hard. What's next?"
---
Or you could actually go to the source of the problem, protest that and make a difference.
---
Instead of wishy-washy bullshit like 'it could make a difference potentially if more people maybe did this'. You could actively go out and help the issue at hand and go to the people directly responsible, instead of a private video game company just enforcing their ToS.
---
Yep. That or run with a bunch of crowd pummlers
---
Did you do the quest In the Name of the Light?  Bonebiter is better and attainable as a quest reward.  Unless you like spinning around, that is.
---
3) I've been playing 90% of evenings since a week after launch (changed servers 1 week in) levelling alongside my other half. Tonight we were going to start looking at the end-game dungeons like BRD and BRS as we approach 60 and start to assemble gear that I could look at and think "gee, that's a good item". Then this blog post comes along to tell us that we're too far behind other players and they already want to give us catch-up mechanics and simplify everything before we've even started.
---
They've treated Dire Maul as a panic button to hit after the subscriptions of the transient one-month players ceased, 8.25's predictable failure to re-engage anybody and a possible reaction to the upcoming Archeage release. I'm appalled.
---

---
Third category: that well known DM farm runs will be even more popularized by streamers, and gold inflation will skyrocket. It was inevitable and it will take a while, but DM is a farmer's heaven for several classes so a lot of gold will be getting pumped into the system.
---
sitting on 19 days played not even 60.
---
thank you for taking this stance, this whole situation feels like an absolute betrayal from a company that formed my entire childhood.
---
The camera doesn't have anything to do with it, you can turn it as you like
---
Theres a repeatable quest that gives you reputation with the night elf mount people. You need high reputation with them to be able to buy the mount. This person wanted the mount. so they repeated the quest (which is to turn in some cloth) over and over until they were able to get the mount.
---
I kinda regret rolling horde, and now that I'm 60 and raiding I kinda regret rolling hunter.
---
I went horde and picked Whitemane because the only RL friend I have who's playing said he would be doing the same. I miss the alliance capital cities. I enjoyed leveling a hunter but they're very one-dimensional in pve. I've started leveling a shaman and am enjoying it a lot.
---
Listen to my advice bruhs. I tank this all the time
---
I think it was that gnomes were getting dismounted in shallower water than other classes (I could be wrong). If that's true I'm guessing the logic for dismounting in water has to do with part of the character model colliding with the water surface, so the easiest fix was to make the character model farther off the ground with a bigger mount
---
a lot of them on that one spot near Kargath
---
I just enjoy watching people get mad over these kinds of posts where it’s not a screenshot. I just don’t get why people get so mad about it, this isn’t some sort of high art that requires only the highest quality of pictures.
---
I said the same thing when you got shamans and we got paladins in TBC. Fucking disgusting.
---
There is no social contract.
---
Evasion? Lol not needed. Cheap shot, hemo hemo, rupture, dead zone the warrior while they bleed to death.
---
Yeah, lets hold everyone else back because Casuals, who have no downside whatsoever, demand casual-catered content releases.
---
Go back to BFA dude
---
Ditto...
---
/facepalm
---
But Dire Maul is the Vanilla equivalent of Magister's Terrace. It's overall itemization is a league above the other dungeons.
---
I say that because the stat distribution on items is great for the most part, in comparison to let's say Strath, where a boss drops maybe one good item, the rest is junk.
---
You also get new mage water, great trinket options for some classes, Quel'Serar and class mounts.
---
This is pretty much it, I like to tab through my targets too when pulling multiple mobs.
---
/mountspecial command is where it's at.
---
Why you need so many rolls wtf?
---
/target xxx is enough
---
Thank you for the rotation advice. Would you say that the threat talent is more important than the extra stun length talent? Those are the two in the tree I have the most trouble choosing between.
---
Honestly, considering how heavily farmed Devilsaur leather is and how often I see people selling the gloves/pants, I'd say it's probably worth buying.
---
Didnt even use that word so im confused why you even posted this?
---
It really does not get better though, not while leveling. But stick with it anyways and make sure you’re a couple levels above what you’re fighting and things are way better.
---
This. A thousand times this. Note that tanking higher level dungeons generally requires Protection spec, which makes the warrior useless for solo questing/farming, absent costly respecs. That's a high price to pay to serve a rotating cast of PUG DPS who ignore basic instructions and repeatedly rip threat because they're more concerned with their DPS meter e-peen than avoiding a wipe. If they do pull aggro and get merc'd, they invariably get salty at the tank. Behavior does not change. They go down a couple times, they drop group mid-run. And you're wondering why nobody wants to tank PUGs?
---
Get t3 or filthy casual
---
48 lasted a lifetime.
---
Grats though
---
Almost lvl 56 and I feel like I have been playing a ton. Honestly can't wait to slow down a bit and just raid log for a few weeks after I get pre-raid bis
---
Individually, each sub matter very little, sure. But in aggregate this will hurt them. How many people do you think are cancelling because of this? I would say at least 1k, or around 15k a month, and 180k a year. That’s one or two people’s salary.
---
&gt; Breaking: Effective immediately, Blizzard has removed Hong Kong Hearthstone player blitzchung from Hearthstone Grand Masters, rescinded all his prize money, and have suspended him from pro play for one year for his recent interview. 
---
- Participation in Hearthstone Grand Masters? Canceled
---
- Price money? Canceled
---
- Pro play for the next year? Canceled
---
Oh this is awkward
---
A warrior complaining about a Rogue. You must be terrible.
---
It's alright, you're free to be wrong. And you're right: the really sharp people spotted it happening in late vanilla already. A friend of mine called it back then and we just laughed at him.
---
New things opening up for people at 60 is a good thing. There is almost nothing to do on my 60 currently. Until phase 2 comes out I pretty much wont play it as it stands.
---
Swipe is three yes, but I think cleave has far better damage output.
---
It’s pretty obvious you don’t know much about this game if you think my story is far-fetched, lmao
---
I rocked it for a bit before I replaced it with a Mara drop then Thrash Blade. Was fun to thunderclap mobs.
---
Ill restate this to make sure I understand. 
---
Agility gives crit. The actual crit you get from agility is (AGI - 240 + 0.8*wepskill) * 0.05.
---
That is at 60, at other levels this 240 will be some other number dependant on lvl.
---
Freedom of speech (the constitutional right) doesn’t cover most “nasty things”. It’s the right for you to go out and peacefully protest the government, and also excludes religion from being a part of government.

I remember the good old days of getting chinese players knocked offline by mentioning Tiananmen.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
God fucking damn it
---
Like 10-6, dinner when I get home, bed time routine with kid, spend an hour or so with wife, go on WoW around 10pm until 4 am, sleep and go back to work.
---
Then on my day off, I sleep in until about noon to recover, spend all day with family until bed, and hang out with wife for three or four hours and go to bed.
---
The key is to take days off from wow.
---
Fair point and I don't uses these. The world is pretty interconnected.
---
Maybe because it isn't wow related.
---
I did yell IRL though, does that count?
---
I am one with the cleave, sir.
---
Wow. Details can fuck off if it's doing this now. I can't be assed getting messages from idiot pugs telling me I'm doing something wrong by not following the latest icy-veins guide.
---
What about pallys though?
---
New goal: hit 60 on Faerlina alliance
---
That's not even remotely comparable.
---
You should truly question your moral character or intelligence if you can equate Blizzard contributing to the censorship of oppression/civil injustice in China to employment termination over social media usage.
---
Came here to flame because I, a casual, advocate for the hardcore (that which I once was, but am no longer due to the same circumstances). Then read your post and upvoted. Well said. Keep the dates close enough to keep the hardcore active, but also elongate it for the rest of the more casual players to catch up. A good balance will be, in my opinion, the best way to keep a large, solid player base which is better for both hardcore and casuals in the long run.
---
You ally scum or a hordie? I'm on benediction too and trying to see if we are allowed to be friends.
---
And the other dungeons?
---
Ah thank you
---
I’m not asking you to bend over backwards. 
---
I’m asking you to be a good human. To stop using bigoted language and to help ensure we stay safe, to help build a world (for example) where teens won’t get kicked out of their house for being LGBTQ.
---
Are these truly topics that you think are ‘catering to the whims’? As if these are trivial?
---
Youd be surprised at how many people are living the "sitcom humor" of this.
---
Havent played in a very long while but this whole situation, and this post in particular, has really taken my tentative plan to play Classic with my brother/friends out behind the shed and shot it.  
---
You and your fellow Hong Kongers are an inspiration, stay brave and stay safe out there. I’ll see about donating to some of the actors in the protests so it feels like I’m atleast trying to do something that might help a bit. For what its worth though, all the love and support from Sweden.
---
Lok’tar Ogar!
---
They made me rename my Druid healer once I hit 10, he was beautiful and good. Sonofabirch I will never forget you
---
Honestly that's what I was figuring. I know I'm so close to getting WW and WW axe and I have two higher level friends that can help. I just need to stick it out it seems.
---
I didn't know that about sunder armor... Hmmm I'm going to give that a shot, see how it works for me.
---
Thanks so much for your response!
---
For the horde.... I mean
---
Nameplates only appear in melee range. Like 10m or something dumb
---
although this is only 1 dungeon, I already feel rushed lol... I was taking my time leveling, but isnt DM a catchup mechanic dungeon??
---
My 3900x and Radeon VII plays this beautifully...
---
...on 2 cores, while the rest are running compiles or crunching Monero.
---
Imagine being this much of a virgin.
---
What patch did Kil' Ogram come out originally? I love that boss
---
So you know exactly what I meant and so did everyone else and you went from politely trying to correct someone to just being a pompous asshole. So great job on that and native speaker or not this is reddit not a formal email or anything to deal with businesses or work so forgive me if I don't write in fully correct english on a fucking gaming forum lol.
---
The good life lol

Boggles bro!

You're point being?

Assuming you're a warlock, get a Thunderfury.

Not even a part of this sub, but you sir are a great representation of it.

Lmao hey it's my desperadoman
---
Fairly dedicated towards the leveling or end game? My goal is to tank. I love tanking in any MMO I play. I'm not looking to be a badass MT. Just want to tank in my dungeon runs when I do them.
---
Shhhh that's how I'm planning on getting my gear. Me and one other druid racing to 60.
---
Did you ever find a coolline for classic?  Currently looking for this exact thing myself, its simple and did its job on other servers I was on ;)
---
Mandatory tips is not a tip. That’s a fee.
---
Only spot they would fit
---
I actually didn't downvote you, this is in fact a public forum. And as far as snark goes, my response to you was literally just trying to understand how the comment made sense (based in my misunderstanding of the context). I responded to your (you must admit, snarky) comment and explained the confusion I was experiencing. How is that snarky?
---
Not bad, but Scouting Gloves of the Monkey are better for 19 Twink Rogues.
---
The fact that it's a pattern, it's not best in slot, and it's cross faction might make it hard to find a buyer.
---
releasing dire maul now is way more in line with the time line of the original wow launch, than what was planned. at least for EU
---
Are you mad :)
---
You deserve more upvotes. Hate it when people undercut a silver or copper. If you're gonna undercut to make a sale, then drop the price and make a true undercut. 7g buyout? 6g 75s or something
---
The open world content of walking?
---
goodlands good
---
I am level 39, no way I’ll do the content
---
Im level 26. So I'm not successful at wow I guess. 😂

Fuck blizzard. After putting 7 years into this company I'm fucking disgusted.
---
Msg me, send gold plx
---
As a spectator I can tap too
---
Well dang there it is. they must not have a product manager, I haven't been playing since it popped up because I assumed they were getting ddosed or something.
---
I still have mine original one in the bank from vanilla. 
---
"Seething darkness engulfs the eye" is the best tool tip in the game
---
You want two sets. Hybrid set for PvP with stam/armor also emphasized, and a +healing for pve.
---
My PvP goal:
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/aEaTxxPKXYuzxanMMbvRTe
---
My PvE goal:

https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/xzVhtY9yvUH6VvVwBny5Gg
---
I'm still debating HP vs Mp5 for PvE healing, but the alternative is 500hp and 45mp5.
---
Super worth.  Do everything else, and you can enter SFK pretty early on as a healer.  Or, just get a higher level guildie to run you to the hammer.  He/she doesn't need to be 60 or anything.
---
I probably wont even be level 60 for a while due to cancelling my sub due to... recent events
---
/u/Joana_WoW
---
The min maxing we need to see
---
Frequented pretty much anything BUT /pol/ back in the day. It's a right-wing shithole.
---
WHAT!!!
---
Lmao it's Napsers, just Google it.
---
Nice try, wife.
---
There's nothing comparable to it in that level range as far as damage goes, not to mention the stats.
---
The low to mid 20s go by fast, though. If you can't find an SFK group in a timely manner, you can find better blue weapons in BFD or RFK around level 26 or so.
---
Oh yeah, for sure. What's scary is that it sounds like they're being pressured into accelerating Classic's timeline, which would suck IMO. Sure there might be some content drought for some people, but that's what alts are for
---
Can't people push PvP ranks faster earlier now since they were geared first?
---
Not bad at all actually
---
I still am!
---
Cool we got mr hypothetical over here. I'll be looking forward to the pvp vid and the rogue vids, please link them here.
---
Can we give him money VIA go find me, and or lets donate to his stream.
---
Wtf?  Warriors wreck rogues...
---
Damage is damage? Idk
---
Is rogue one of them? I can't make shit for gold, lvl 60 with 34g lol
---
&gt; keep it sheeped
---
Sheep is still used a lot from what I see in LBRS and up, but nowadays if stuff is living long enough that a resheep is necessary something has gone seriously wrong lol.
---
Also, Rouges are the most overpowered class. It’s a fact.
---
Disenchant thunderfury you won’t
---
Beats Gromgol.
---
"Yeah, we're gonna need you to go up to Hinterlands which is a 10 minute flight path and kill a bunch trolls and out their skulls on pikes. Then come back down for your shitty XP.
---
You didn’t put the kids up for adoption when they announced Classic? You have me seriously questioning your commitment to raiding.
---
You care because?
---
Same here. First 60 is fully decked. Only login for raids and dungeons. Working on my alts now.
---
&gt;Those horde could have brought some friends to help them out, too
---
This was my favorite part about Vanilla and BC world PvP. Kill someone with some friend and they might bring them out. Then you bring your friends out. Then you call in guild support. Then they call in guild support. Then both side start shouting in capital cities for support. And begun, the real world PvP has.
---
You missed out on old content because nobody was playing it anymore, and you didn’t know what you were missing, so it’s fine.
---
But Classic is our chance to play the content we missed. We know about it now, and we don’t want to miss it again.
---
Blizzard disappoints me year after year, honestly.
---
Can you elaborate on what a "for the Horde/ Alliance run" is?
---
We need more tanks in 5 man content. Druids Paladins and warriors are all find for 5 mans.
---
Hunter 32 alliance, I need a new malee weapon, Where can I find someonething with agi
---
Looking for a Horde guild on Bloodfang, still leveling currently with a lvl 26 Priest. Looking for a not so serious guild that's fun to be around, not looking for a second job.
---
I just got back from a vacation, and I wasn’t on Reddit during that time. Try to think logically buddy - it’s *really* not that difficult to put 2 + 2 and realize that people spend time away from Reddit. 
---
Surely someone of such elevated intelligence as yourself should be capable of coming to that (very simple, and obvious) conclusion without any prompting... hmm...
---
My opinion on some tanking tips : Don't take forever between pulls. Will kill the group unless the it is clear everyone is cool spending 2 hours in this dungeon. With that being said, don't pull when healer is out of mana. It's cool to pull if hes drinking unless boss/massive pull. Be attentive. Not only is speed a factor when pulling mobs but positioning is just as important. Get a bow/gun to pull and reduce the risk of extra aggro. Use Line of Sight to your advantage when pullings casters/ranged mobs.
---
Yes i am 60. Was going to farm some Tyr's Hand elites to test out my damage. I do have 5/5 TM
---
Yeah. But tbh as a casual, you could hit 60 only at ZG release and catch up REAL QUICK
---
I go on reddit for the drama
---
Just 20 man it.
---
Yeah, AQ40 was a showstopper for a lot of guilds back in the day.  There are some pretty movement intensive/coordination fights.  I don't think anything is going to be a hard barrier to progression like it was back in the day, but I am happy with that :)
---
This is tough. I try to play less on non-raid days. Also, set designated times for family. For example; we have family movie night every Friday. In general, I try to limit play until they’re in bed, so that means late nights for me (good thing I’m naturally a night owl). One advantage is I am self employed so I can start work later in the morning or afternoon. Bottom line: make sure you’re setting aside time specifically for the kids.
---
A geared warrior can wreck any class.
---
its almost as if reddit was infested with do little do gooders who just want to tell thier university lecturer with the pink buzz cut and glasses she doesnt need, how towerwant and gwood they are by being outraged by something that is so simlply nothing...
---
I think its more annoying with consumables and mats being undercut. Unless it's a common crafted item, most gear wont have a stable price, so undercutting it is fine.
---
Thats a pretty good guild name though!
---
dire maul release is timed against the archage mmo release. that is all.
---
sure man, give me your info
---
Already cancelled sub. Company is dead.
---
haha that's fucked
---
I will speak up just to say I fall in the first group. My concern is strictly changing the announced release date to something sooner. DM had a release date (phase 2) and is now being pushed up. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth because I’m left to wonder what else will be released ahead of schedule? Obviously this is a slippery slope fallacy but after seeing what retail has become... I am hesitant to trust the decision making at blizzard. I would rather they just stick to the schedule that they announced.
---
That right there is proof they didn't use the original *1.12.3* version since they obviously made improvements to it, which brought it up to 1.13.
---
reason #3 why I just decided not to buy into WoW for the first time ever, which would be the first dollar Blizzard has gotten from me since they bought out and shut down all of the truly great studios.
---
Capitalism isn‘t a political system. China has capitalism too. And no, we‘re not getting used to this. In fact resistance is growing. The CCP has gone too far, people are finally waking up to all the evil things they are up too.
---
Stick it out till you can spec mortal strike. You'll be amazed at how strong you can be. MS will replace sunder armor and heroic strike and you'll have one of the best melee abilities for pvp.
---
Leveling mainly. I don’t remember how rage starved warriors are in 5 mans but I think it was fun.
---
I'm right here with you. Longtime WoW player, here since vanilla, always said I'd be there until they shut the servers down. Today I unsubbed, and I cried, and   I talked to my wee guild about what MMORPG we're going to move to and play instead. It's a small sacrifice compared to what the people of HK are going through, but it still hurts. But I'm proud to see so many of us putting our money where our beliefs are. I'd wanted to do something for HK, and I guess this is it. 
---
Stay strong HK, we're with you.
---
If I spam enough, maybe my personal rage will transfer to my character.
---
Boats is so level 30...
---
Real priests repeatedly give people lava baths at BLackrock mountain. 
---
Gotta keep those repair vendors in business.
---
Nope. As a level 60, level 48+ are going to give you honor
---
Reroll orc shaman
---
48 is perfect for hinterlands, almost everything at town is yellow then, and its a lot of quests
---
You're now arguing an entirely different claim related to enforcing rules. 
---
Your initial comment equated outrage over old social media posts to Blizzard contributing to censorship of the Hong Kong riots and Chinese civilian oppression.  By your logic, the two are of the same severity, which is simply wrong and fucked up to consider comparable.
---
Hey guys! My guild downed Onyxia last night for the first time with only 31 people. I know to some it may not seem like a huge deal but we had to work for it and had a lot of fun doing it. Any constructive criticism is welcome, this is the first boss kill video I've ever edited together. Hope you guys enjoy!
---
As a warlock - bring it on.
---
Fact is, blizzard is no longer blizzard. The guys who started blizzard and made it great aren't there anymore. Activision did what it always do, make shitty game and market the fuck out of it.
---
Some people have learnt to only demand the impossible, and end up being gravely offended when their demands aren't met. :D
---
Like, I wouldn't be surprised if he had demanded I made a US acc too and checked prices on all US servers as well.
---
I'm glad you like the guide haha :)
---
I whole heartedly agree.... AFTER Phase 2 is introduced.
---
Id say at least 60% of the fan base of the game is PVP oriented, and without an honor system driving a large portion of world pvp, numbers will likely drop in pvp servers, especially for those not entering dueling tournaments.
---
If they release Phase 2 earlier than expected, I personally would be happy. (i have 2 level 20s and a level 10) but I would 100% stand behind a huge gap of between Phase 2 and 3. Or even between Phase 3 and Phase 4 solely because of bg releases.
---
My optimal timeline is Phase 2 - December 2019. Phase 3 - May 2020. Phase 4 - Blizzconn 2020.
---
Actin all self righteous, but keybinds aren't an addon lol.

Is there a macro for wolf pets for the furious howl?

Over last couple of weeks I enjoyed re-living Classic experience, but not it's time to grow up. 
---
I've cancelled my subscriptin and deleted the games. We vote with our wallets. This is not the world I like to live in.
---
I'm right there with you. Like if you got two buddies in the city sure I'll summon you, but the other day I was in feralas and some dude messages me like hey summon me no please or anything.
---
Ahhh, sorry what I meant to say was git gud faggot
---
Prison Shank in Stockades. Dagger with Agi.

Pair with any decent green from AH.

Dire Maul is for the "casual player" to get into and clear MC. A little boost with some extra pieces that you didn't get from only doing BRD/BRS/Strat/Scholo a handful of times each, some pieces that give a bit more tolerance to "meme" specs in MC and even in BWL, because that casual player hasn't had MC on farm and doing split runs since week 2. Dire Maul makes the barrier to entry for raids a little smaller without trivializing the other content, the more hardcore players have gotten their step up on the masses and now the more casual players are going to start to look at raiding too.    
---
I think the timing of the release of Dire Maul is not a real indicator of how fast content will be released, neither is phase 2. It's the time from p1/p2 -&gt; p3 that will really give us an idea of the pace of content. Keep in mind that most "casual players" won't make it too far into content p5/p6 content regardless of the release schedule. The later the content, the exponentially larger the gap between hardcore and casual players completing it will be
---
That is actually impressive.
---
&gt; you guys wanna see my impersonation of the print screen button?
---
Yeah but fights dont last that long. Depending on level and especially on gear. One interrupt can win a fight. One missed interruption can lose a fight.
---
I saw a statistic also posted to reddit, china has more computer player than the united states does people...
---
You saod stuck, not burned out
---
There is a honey pot, right?

You don't pay extra, you just have both

It depends on who you talk to. Some people have told me heroic strike is not worth it due to the rage cost for damage.
---
I'd hope you'd realize at the first boss..
---
You can tank and level fine as fury or arms. I used to do it as arms but fury will work too.
---
For basic low level stuff you'll want to be in defensive stance, if you can charge in to generate rage first that will help.
---
You'll want to use sunder armor and if it's a large pack of mobs use tab targetting to throw a couple sunders on one target then switch to the next and repeat so you hold aggro on them.
---
Thunderclap will help add aoe aggro instantly too but not a whole lot, useful still though
---
Use taunt as much as you need if you are losing threat on anything
---
If you are having trouble holding threat feel free to tell your dps to stop aoeing/focus on hitting your target (using a skull marker on who you are killing first can help)
---
If there is a ranged mob or caster in a group you will probably want to los (line of site) pull it, shoot it with ranged then run behind something like a wall that breaks line of site which will force the mob to run to you instead of staying where it is shooting. If the area is clear you can just charge in and tank it where it is, but often in dungeons doing that can risk pulling extra mobs.
---
I have not tanked in a long time, but from memory those should get you going with basics at your level. Also your group sound like dicks but you were also rude to someone telling you to look at a guide, honestly if you want to go beyond basics just google how to vanilla tank as a warrior and watch some youtube clips. There's a big difference between being a good tank and just tanking, you will want to learn more advanced techniques with stance dancing and rage dumping to increase you threat and stuff later.
---
While I totally agree with you and don't want to see all the phases rushed out and have Naxx or even AQ40 live within the next year, both DM and the honor system should have been day 1 releases.
---
“I made some bad investments”
---
I mark every single undead rogue I see because they'll never not gank you.
---
I don't know why, but I just pictured you yelling "I... declare... BANKRUPTCYYYYYYY!!!" It had absolutely nothing to do with this.
---
...but yes, it totally counts.
---
i'm more of an altaholic. I'm trying to quit. sticking to my current toon and wont let myself log into any alts until i hit 30. I don't really mind the concept of new content being added at whatever pace it is, I just know that diremaul adds a lot of bis items that makes raiding MC even more useless for most people, meaning by the time i get to endgame everyone will want to do diremaul instead of what i want to do such as ubrs and lbrs and mc/ony. I'm probably wrong and it probably won't be that bad but that's just what i think.
---
Wowhead classic says he's a rare spawn, so that's what I'm going with.  He was a rare spawn in vanilla - I farmed him on my rogue back in the day.  I can only assume \#nochanges.
---
Well crap. Seems one you beat me to the AH on Westfall. XD
---
&gt; If you eat out in the US at a full-service restaurant and don't tip, you're an asshole.
---
Don't call it a "tip" if we're going to pretend it's an obligation on part of the customer to directly fund someone's wage because their job doesn't offer a livable wage. Call it what it actually is and get off your high horse.
---
I think hunter, warlock, and mage have the best farms in DM. You could probably make good money pickpocketing BRD tho. Lots and lots of humanoids packed in close.
---
Blizzard was in a lose/lose situation and made the logical call. Regardless of how you feel about Hong Kong or China, losing a few thousand customers in the West to moral protest is way better than losing a few million in China. Not to mention the opportunity cost of a billion people. The US will not ban Blizzard games, China will. Easy decision.
---
Man, I was wanting to get WoW time once I finally had some me money.
---
Wanting.
---
Not anymore. Anywhere else I can send my $16? Maybe a gofundme for Hong Kong🇭🇰 or anything?
---
Ok awesome. I'm gonna do my best to grit my teeth and get through it!
---
Wrong. For the most obvious example; diremaul gear is good enough for BWL
---
As I understand it it's the highest TPS weapon for Vaelastrasz due to the infinite rage, but other than that it's just a good dagger rogue offhand.
---
Losing his winnings is one thing, but a 1 year ban for briefly saying he supports the pro-democracy, pro-liberty protesters? 
---
There's enforcing a rule, and then there's punishing someone because they spoke out against the all-powerful Chinese government. This was the latter.

---
What happened?
---
There is some sick satisfaction out of mind controlling on the boat right before the load screen.
---
This is not subtle
---
That pole got nice DPS on it
---
I've ran BRD 30+ times in classic so far and he's been spawned every single time... That staff of his is a rare spawn tho lemme tell ya lol
---
Thanks for the reply. I look forward to tanking later on. I find it the most fun role by far.
---
You get dodge from the agi as well
---
I've had this happen twice. Both times with shamans
---
if you're interested in the reasons for this, I can explain in fairly simple generalisations here.
---
The best spec for levelling is arms.  It lends itself to both tanking and dps, and does not have high gear requirements to be effective such as DW fury spec does.   So they are all arms... UNTIL level 60 when they respec, and often to a DPS spec not as well suited for tanking as their levelling arms build.
---
But wait, there's more.  Every group of 5 in a dungeon needs to be at least 20% tank, ie have one tank.   However a 40 man raid does not require 8 tanks, it only requires 2 tanks.   Suddenly there is not much work for tanks once they hit max level and start raiding.   Their guild needs them to front up and do dps, possibly even buy leather gear for doing more dps, and spec for it.   
---
So it might appear to be a disgrace from your perspective, but from all the level 60 warriors out there who don't want to drag your lazy dps ass through dungeons anymore because we have been doing it for 60 levels and finally we are no longer "a tank".   
---
A disgrace.. please.  An inconvenience for you perhaps, but no warrior owes you tanking services ever, lv 60 or otherwise
---
Can I have your stuff? o/
---
I just noticed the imp heroic strike - yeah never take that talent for any reason.
---
If you're heroic striking as a fury warrior and you're above level 40, something is deeply wrong. It's even iffy as a rage dump due to the extra threat. I used to just cleave or even hamstring.
---
we clear up to rag evety week pugging, itd a joke
---
You're right in the fact that losing the *entire* Chinese market would be more expensive than this bad PR, but the Chinese market is also smaller than you might think. Asia is [only 12%](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial) of their total net revenues. That's counting all of Asia, more than China. I think if we hold on to this thorn and attack Blizzard enough for it, they could lose more than they gain from this decision and we can hold them accountable for suppressing Human Rights.
---
Lol, heroic ramparts was hard enough. Shattered halls was insane!
---
That’s not casual...
---
It's pretty nice to help out others. I've helped out some when doing the mage quest from time to time. Also someone doing the chicken escort quest, besides one time we waited until the horde that got there first picked it up, then a lone spriest picked it up first. He didn't survive. But then he joined the other horde spriest I hang out with in tanaris and help out when I see him level.
---
Same. My phone has so much more free space now too.
---
AAP only goes up to 40 and you have to follow it directly or it could bug up. No dungeons, no skipping quests, no taking other quests and turning them in. 
---
Questie will show you quests available and where to complete them so it allows a lot more freedom and works to 60. 
---
Haven’t used ClassicCodex so can’t say anything about that.
---
I used AAP and Questie at the same time until I reached the end of AAP then I disabled it. Questie has been nice but I still find myself using WoWHead with it.
---
Well it's already almost emote only anyway. There are so many blocked words and phrases it's not even funny anymore.
---
If it worth far more than 100g to you, then why not buy it on AH? If you're only holding off because you're still hoping to get it to drop yourself, then fair enough. But if someone would never buy edgemasters for their market price, then it's not really fair to give it to them since they clearly don't value it for what it's worth.
---
debatable. Bonebiter has better raw stat but ravager has that monstrous proc. I agree with you for leveling bonebiter IMHO is better. If this was endgame then ravager all the way.
---
That 20 an hour for more stressful job would actually be worth it if your current job paid more. Do you not understand this?
---
You got a list of shit paying jobs or a choice of starvation and picked the shiniest turd. Congrats.
---
You are a dummy.
---
It's all about money, China makes Acti/Blizz too much money, so they side with them
---
If it's a random % chance, you have a sample size of one fight. The shammy got really lucky.
---
I guess noone read what I wrote here. They are proccing with every autoattack. If you think its normal to hit above 600 at lvl43 with every autoattack. then good luck with the pvp at lvl60.
---
They did NOT fix d3. You can't even trade in the game, it's basically a single player game now and nothing like the best game of the series Diablo 2. Path of exile is better than Diablo 3 and it was made by some small New Zealand company
---
Number 9
---
Yeah but you can buy the racial mount for 100g after the dreadsteed quest, save a lot of gold and have your far more badass looking dreadsteed mount for when you want it.
---
it's likely they were always like that to other people, you just didn't know until you were in the line of fire. don't feel bad for ditching them.
---
Probably going to make some lowbie's day. The true classic experience is dueling someone buck naked then giving them 40g when they win and then logging off. That is how we ride into the sunset.
---
Wow ending the subscription of a big company. Brutal. Tell me more how you have done more for the Chinese people before.
---
If Blizzard does not revisit and fix this, I'm sorry Warcraft remaster (and anything else I might buy from Blizzard in the future), but it was just never meant to be.
---
No caps in names so people will just think you're a Freehk.
---
People can charge more for stuff on the AH and quests will take longer to complete.....wooo
---
What is the best way to level no a days. I want to make my mage alt for gold making, but I'm unsure if dungeon grinding, questing, or a combo of the two are optimal to get to 60 in the least possible time.
---
So many posts saying downranking doesn't come into play until you raid or have a certain amount of +heal... That's really odd as I started doing it right when I got the 2nd rank of my first healing spell.
---
I can't stand the thought of wasting mana on overhealing and I at least want the tank or myself in solo-play to be somewhere near full before I pull. So how do I make sure I can do both at the same time? Downranking! Maxrank, 2/3rd of Maxrank and 1/3rd of max-rank is what I try to keep around.
---
I also only downrank the "slow but efficient" heal, as there's usually no point in downranking stuff like Rejuvenation or Regrowth, which are situational-spells which I wouldn't use unless I really need a lot of healing in the least amount of cast-time.
---
Because it's a mini adventure. There's things to see, pvp, (if your on a pvp server) mining, gathering, and a million other things that would be completely skipped if they added the robotic process of clicking the lfg button and then getting transported to the dungeon.
---
My favorite song in the game &lt;3
---
They scale ridiculously well with gear is why. When you're leveling your stats are generally shit, so when you get to the endgame and start picking up good gear your gameplay changes in a big way.
---
A WILD MOD APPEARS!
---
MOD USES LOGIC...
---
IT’S SUPER EFFECTIVE!
---
Heh, they wish that were today's top news. Much better than what they're facing atm.
---
"Please I dont have the time anymore because I put myself in a rut by getting married and having 26 kids"
---
That’s my goal, but with Corrupted Ashbringer.
---
Nothing will because Classic isn't multithreaded.
---
Doesn't everyone have Chinese phones?
---
Despite your picture I still don’t believe it. I’m gonna have to check it out later today.
---
Yes it's a spell. So it needs something like 5% to not be resisted\* against trash and dungeon bosses and 16% spell hit to not be resisted\* by raid bosses.
---
Mocking blow is based on melee hit, but only forces the target to attack you for 6s. A true taunt also sets your threat to be equal to whoever has the most threat.
---
Challenging Shout is spell hit and behaves like mocking blow. But it is AoE, and still better than Pala taunt...
---
\*: There is always a 1% chance a spell misses, and no amount of +hit can prevent this.
---
I'm done too. Been playing since the first version of WOW.
---
A LITTLE BIT OF DIRE MAUL IN MY LIFE
---
I like this a lot very funny
---
Then you ban him them, genius.
---
This is not hard.
---
Basic human rights, such as China is currently, right now, in the process of destroying are objectively good. Objectively speaking, with zero wiggle room, China is wrong. And everyone should be saying so. 
---
Punishing people for saying so is objectively wrong. And they went as far as they could. 
---
You don't have to tolerate rape apologists or cannibals, or heck even speeches about actual controversial issues with sane people on both sides during your game nonsense. 
---
But cannot side with China right now and call yourself a decent human being. 
---
This is not morally gray.

Gotta keep the streamers happy that play for 16+ a day.

This is exactly where I’m at now at 42 and I’ve lost motivation to be in Badlands or STV anymore. Feel too high for SM  and too low for Ulda and hate RFD.

This post is making me consider abandoning my plans for a priest for my first alt. I’m afraid it’s going to be too similar to leveling my rogue to 60 though. Definitely sounds fun!

Retail have a huge problem with tanks in dungeons too, idk why he said that

You're talking about the blizzard that made diablo 2 and warcraft 3 . That blizzard doesn't exist anymore. Calling them activision would be more accurate.
---
I don‘t need to google it, I‘m from Shenzhen, the city where Tencent was founded and is still headquartered.
---
temper their expectations that their spec will perform better at their role and that, as the druid said, new BiS items will be available for feral tanks? I don't get why you "hope their joking"
---
Obviously the one who did Need. It's safer if everyone does need so people can't ninja.
---
And all the big WoW streamers will be banned
---
D3s real money auction house was where the tumor that is engulfing the company first appeared.
---
Next was the parade of store mounts and gold tokens in WoW. 
---
Take note: while fans and critics are bashing BFA, it’s making a hefty profit from micro transactions. 
---
Races changes, character boosts, faction changes, store mounts, recruit a friend bonuses,etc. 
---
All these serve to suck money out of player instead of add to the game in any significant way.
---
So many people saying don’t play a pvp server if your gonna complain about pvp half the fun is complaining about the no lifers camping zones for days then getting a group and camping them back. If we all just got killed and silently walked back that would be boring as hell.
---
Damn I feel bad for your kid lol
---
Are you saying that China has a law that would compel Blizzard, an internationally operating but American based publicly traded corporation to take the action they did?  They don’t.
---
Yeah, I mainly paid attention to joining a server that didn't have a huge queue when I started.  I just figured it was similar to Diablo 3, with all the servers being west coast.
---
This might explain though why I can never find a group.  I get off work ready for dungeon exploring, and only 3 people are on in my guild.  When I'm about to crash for the night, 40+ people are on.
---
Arcane/Frost raiding spec doesn't allow for Imp. Blizzard.
---
There's like 4x the population of China to America, voting with your wallet isn't going to work here.
---
Vote with actual votes is probably more effective.
---
Which works out to be...
---
Blizzard banned a Heathstone Grandmaster for saying something in support of the Hong Kong protest. They also fired both of the people interviewing him for simply being there. I'm leaving out important bits because I'd rather you realize I'm minimizing when you read the full story rather than get the impression I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. If you look you'll come across it. It's made the news.
---
I feel such a huge hatred towards Blizzard now thanks to your comment. You're completely right, these fuckers don't deserve anything from you.
---
Eh... it started out porn (Though she made a SFW version that's stilted at the beginning because of the removed comics).
---
Better than your "This is totally a bug that is OP and hasn't been fixed and also i have no proof the bug still exists" claim
---
Nah that’s trash. No changes means do go around fucking everything up by adding cash shop options and redoing talent trees. They can and should fix bugs that are obvious bugs and not the vanilla designers intent. The whole idea is just to preserve to original classic feel and intention, not to replicate every spelling mistake and coding error.
---
Have only had this happen once. I think there was a shaman. No idea where they came from we cleared the balcony after the bar so not from there. I did track elementals and there are those kind of mobs underneath the room you fight him. Maybe something triggers them to come up. That is the only think I can come up with.
---
When I played on private, I edited the sound file to remove that mecha sound. Waaaay better. Not sure if you can do it in classic or if it'd be "bannable"..
---
yep, layered
---
or as they say in the Barrens: JUST LIKE ~~YOUR~~ SOMEONE'S MOM!
---
I know The silithid mount guy xferred years ago.  Beyond that yeah I cant recall the others.
---
You are the majority of reddit users. People that post on reddit regularly are obvious casuals that ain’t 60.
---
This is ONLY because their Diablo mobile market is Chinese. Fuck you Blizzard.

Do you know how shares and stakes work?

Cancelling my WoW sub, no amount of fun or nostalgia is worth this. Fuck you, Blizzard.

---
Mei was actually named Mao all along
---
Basicallly!  No layers will be awesome though, finally WoW will feel like WoW for the first time in 10 years.
---
but could it be that blizzard actually dont care about much other than money and they deemed this to be damaging to thier company, which is why this sort of display isnt allowed ?
---
it just seems that alot of ppl are going a bit crazy with this, i mean what if he influenced someone who was otherwise passive to go out and protest because they saw him wearing the banned gas mask and they get imprisoned or killed? i think there is much father reach of his actions that anyone here will admit, but blizzard are an evil empire against freedom that really put the b in lizzard...?
---
Yea, this doesn't take 1-1 1/2 hours...you're smokin crack bro, or have never leveled it.  At very minimum 5-6 hours.  Took me about 10 to 300.  At 60.  There is a lot of downtime searching for lockbox respawn in lp areas.  Not to mention travel times to get to said areas...which is probably 30-40 minutes in itself.  Pair that with the fact that there are usually rogues in said areas doing the same thing (except brd runs picking locks, or SM early on).   I personally found it a pain in the ass.  Forgot how long it actually took from back in the day.
---
Tip your rogues..they deserve it..esp high level lockboxes.

I don't think that's a good comparison at all lmao

You're right. China definitely does not have state mandated censorship laws, and does not enact heavy fines or bans on companies which break these non-existant laws. 
---
The fact that Blizzard is based in America doesn't mean that they get to do whatever the fuck they want when they're operating inside an area where China enforces it's laws, with 0 risk of repurcussion. When you're in another nation, you're subject to its laws and regulations, whether or not you agree with them. 
---
They've released the rules of the tournament and disparaging and government or supporting any political movement was prohibited. The sole punishment listed was a 1 year ban and a forfeiture of any prize money. 
---
The Chinese government could seize every single cent that blizzard has in China, steal their IP and just continue their development of the stolen IP if they really wanted to, and no one could do a damn thing to stop them.
---
Cringe

I don't remember ever getting crusader in Tyr's hand. Only lots of gold and greens until those got nerfed.

Which still shows better built TV's and LCD's along with other electronics can be bought in other countries at a higher quality than any chicom crap company can put out. Get over yourself you completely ignored the other links showing China being the number fraud in electronics. Just admit you're communist lover and prefer China over the U.S...
---
One thing we all know ,this isn't Blizzard from glory days of WC3 ,SC or even WoW .Those guys are gone ,replaced and company is pretty much just Activision now.
---
Thats why they doing stupid things like rushing DM, layering and cathering to streamers.They will even ruin a old polished game like WoW...They already broke phases promise and i expect worse will happen...
---
You can disable the annoying Mechastrider engine sound. 
---
Make an empty text file, save it as `MechaStriderLoop.ogg`.
---
Create the following directories if they don't exist beyond the `_classic_` folder and save the file as follows:
---
`..\World of Warcraft Classic\World of Warcraft\_classic_\sound\creature\mechastrider\MechaStriderLoop.ogg`
---
You still get the striding movement sounds which has been absolutely fine, just no annoying, constant engine noise.
---
 I found this solution via this subreddit which linked to the official forums so it seemed legit.
---
People didn't target items nearly to this degree... As well now I can see every item i want from a dungeon and only run the ones I need. Just because people continued to run the dungeon doesn't mean the dungeon was useful or meaningful... People still run MC in retail for xmogs and other reasons but the content is irrelevant...
---
So if I'm a 33 warrior i should rend and then spam sunder until half health and then switch to hamstring spam for overpower procs?
---
I might try out final fantasy, have some friends that are enjoying it
---
Easy. Make it so that summoning stones require 3 players, and warlock summon only the lock and one additional. But still, even with summon stones we all love warlocks &lt;3
---
20 days is insanely slow.
---
He was punished to the maximum extent they could. Whereas a player caught cheating and win-trading was given a suspended suspension. In addition, blizz fires the two reporters who had nothing to do with what he said. Then they released a statement putting this boy in his place for speaking out for something important to him. “What else could they have done?” How about stayed the fuck out of it since literally no one was saying “blizz go save Hong Kong and tell Xinnie the Pooh to eat a dick. Yeah, games and politics don’t belong together. So why did blizz have to so publicly take a side? He “broke” an incredibly vague rule that could be interpreted to mean literally anything. But good astroturfing.
---
Well OP, welcome to the server. I hope we cross paths once you're leveled. :D
---
This post is so ripe for /r/whoosh I love it
---
Pretty much the entire reason we're playing classic is to have more of those organic interactions tho?
---
Tab can switch between ennemy targets.
---
im being dramatic here my bad, thats the wrong phrase, 
---
what i mean was, if he accepted his prize, talked about the game, sucked some blizzard d and lied about how great hs is, then went onto twitter to support the protests, or his own live stream, if then blizzard did this i would 100% agree that would be fucked up, but my point is he braught politics to a hearthstone event, why would anyone at blizzard allow thier name to be asscosiated with highly contraversial issues like these, especially when he comes on wearing a gas mask that are banned, he was wearing it in defiance, it wasnt an intellectial debate about the chinese regime, he wanted to make a statement, which was broadcast to blizzards viewers, and now instead of everyone leaving the event and talking about the game and the sick plays, (lol) all the money and man power spent on the event will be tarnished by thier hand being forced to do all this, and tbf i would be pissed too if i handed someone 10k for winning an event i set up then they turn round and fuck me over by doing something no one ever would think would be ok to do on a blizzard hosted hs stream. 
---
?
---
You can simply login and check the realm status. Prior to the update today, most realms were high pop and a handful still show full during the evening and weekends. When servers are constantly showing high pop during the workday, it’s pretty clear that there is a massive player base that spends a great deal of time online. If you genuinely think that players like you, who can barely log 15 hours a week, aren’t a minority, then you’re just a moron.
---
So if I reply to someone that's not 100% pertaining to LoL it should be removed? Majority of the comments removed weren't even about Blizzard. It was suggestions like "say HKA's name out in full."

Honestly you being not even 40 yet .. this far into the game is really slow and behind most players .. why should blizz cater to you only and let others be bored
---
Dude, play with your friends. It’ll be fun, you’ll learn the game. But when the time is right, find your rightful place along the Horde!
---
And then how does the opposite faction speak to the innkeeper to set their hearth if the innkeeper is in combat from being kited? 🤔
---
SM Graveyard and Library have amazing gear for you. Just got my dagger from GY and Off Hand from Lib and it's some very nice added damage.

I believe the tower with the Spellbinder's is the only place in Classic you can farm it, it's usually packed though so good luck!

Yikes guys, just to clarify: it's just a meme, most of us healers don't have a problem with life tapping out of combat until mana and health are equal so it's faster to reg or WLs that use bandage and HS or Life Drain, etc., to get some Health back. 
---
It's my first Meme on reddit and it got kinda viral and I wasn't aware, that this is a topic that keeps on appearing over and over again. I am overwhelmed by all the comments. 
---
This is to all to WLs that refuse to drink and just life tap to 1% to save that sweet sweet Gold for Water ;D And - as a Shaman Healer, without a HoT to cast after the fight: just be aware that due the casting time, we are not able to drink as fast as Druids or Priests. 
---
And if you are a WL that could still laugh about it: I like you. 
---
I just wanted to capture my personal feeling, that's it - glad to see some people could relate to it and made some people laugh. :)
---
And this is why I had quit playing Wow, but came back for Classic (and have to rethink that, now). I have found that a lot of people did this, as well. Retail WoW is just not what it used to be, which is sad because it was a great game. MoP was the last enjoyable expansion for me and I slowly stopped playing after that. Everything is geared to get to level cap, guilds don't matter as much, servers were a mess after cross-realm zones, you don't talk to people unless you have to or you know them, nothing is really the rpg it used to be. It's crazy/funny how I enjoy feeding my pet and having to buy ammo again. I enjoy grouping with random people and people aren't so sucky because realms are keeping people in check again. Blizz lost something and I don't know if it was the merger, but it did seem to go from slowly declining to plummeting into the ground around then.

Apparently you don't know how ravager works. It's best in slot until 60 easily.
---
&gt; can you not see that blizzard didnt want to silence him,
---
No, I don't see that. I see a company, partially owned by Tencent (a gigantic Chinese company) who looked to silence a gamer who made a mention of support to the protesters who are going to continue protesting whether he said anything or not. 
---
I see a company that bowed to the pressure that Chinese money (both current and potential) and made a move that was ultimately in support of an oppressive, anti-democratic, government. 
---
&gt; with blizzard casters, playing a blizzard game, with blizzard plastered on the screen, what happens when someone follows his revolution and gets killed?
---
And how the hell would ANYONE trace it to this ONE show of support, and then go blame Blizzard for it? 
---
Fact is, by doing this, Blizzard has effectively put themselves on the side of the Chinese Government, and whatever the Chinese police/military/pro-government forces do to the protesters, Blizzard will have some part of the blame. 
---
Do you know it should've been handled? "While we respect Mr. Chung's opinion, this is not the place to be making such political statements. We recommend that he use his personal social media accounts for any further statements on this issue, and leave official Blizzard competitions for discussion of the game and the competition. As Mr. Chung has broken one of the rules of this tournament, we are going to have to disqualify him and revoke his prize winnings." 
---
Simply put, the ban is way over the line.
---
The difference is we pay Blizzard, so we have a duty to ensure they're acting ethically.

its pretty interesting since I can contest easily a warry or rogue with my roots and get a good distance to heal first and then burst them down. Mages and locks are much harder but sometimes possible

You or someone in your guild needs rag rep for raids, unless you're planning on completely doing pugs
---
*snap*
---
Yes. Rank 4 healing touch for raid healing, rank 7 for tank healing and that's pretty much it. Precast on tanks and maybe throw a rejuv on if there's movement or cc in the fight.
---
You can have less overhealing than everyone else despite having longer heal cast times
---
Why would they add new servers when the already added new servers are gonna be dead?  Also layering will be removed in phase 2 and a few servers are already down to 2 layer with all others having 2.

I said it’s disgusting to pretend like canceling your WoW sub or commenting on Reddit about how outraged you are is actually providing any meaningful support to the protestors in Hong Kong. It isn’t. It’s disingenuous to suggest it is.

So walking to an instance is a key piece to make sure players participate in owpvp, and farm nodes?

Are there any addons that make my hunter pet attack at the same time as me?
---
No thick hide? why?
---
&gt;It sounds like you're level 30. If you go on to pull the next pack immediately after your healer heals your warlock back to full and starts drinking the tank is not going to survive the 20-30 seconds it's going to take the healer to finish drinking and get in healing range.
---
You don't have to be 100% mana all the time. The tank will be fine for 10 seconds while you get some drink down.
---
&gt;Yeah, when I was running SM I could make a game of getting through the instance without having to drink. Once you're healing BRD+ unless your group outlevels the content you're engaged with you will be counting the longevity of your mana pool in single digit pulls, and not even high single digits. You'll rarely get to use your spirit regen while actively fighting and you'll also spend the full 30 seconds drinking and still not be at full mana.
---
You have it backwards. Unless your group is underleveled, you will still have no problem. If you are going into a full clear of brd at level 50, you are going to have mana problems.
---
&gt;The mana pool of a group's healer is the limiting factor in how quickly a run goes so every care should be taken to as much as possible assist in keeping the healer from having to drink.
---
In my experiences, the tank standing around doing nothing for 10-15 seconds after every pull when we are all waiting around ready to go to the next pack is the limiting factor in how long a PUG dungeon run takes. In guild runs, I'd maybe agree with you if there are no mages - otherwise you should pretty easily be drinking after literally every pull getting any mana you can.
---
Seriously... What? That added nothing to the conversation.
---
I know right? Back in Vanilla, I was leveling when the AQ event hit. I started 8 months after the game released and kept rerolling for months. 
---
I didn't feel like I was behind because more content was getting released. It was awesome because once I got to 60 there was so much more to do. People were still doing 60 5-mans, MC, BWL, AQ20, AQ40, whatever else. Hell, since a lot of them already had gear, I got a ton of it for free since they already had better gear. 
---
This whole "If you aren't first, you're last" mentality is dumb. Not everyone is actually starting the game at launch. Not everyone is going to be 60 at the same time. That's fine, the content will still be there when you get to it.
---

Bind pickpocket to your mousewheel.  Spin your mouse wheel as you tab through targets and move around. My mouse has a button to release the wheel so it just free spins. One good spin and it'll keep going on its own for 45-60 seconds.
---
Take it or leave it, but companies should stay as far away from political drama as possible. Regardless of which side they’re on.
---
if blizzard doesn't value free expression, lets just boycott the shit outta thema
---
Consider me cancelled. This isnt the Horde I fought for. They're not going to make me complicit in this trash.
---
Were you grouped with a shaman?

Hey man least you corrected your mistakes unlike the dumbasses at the bottom

*Laughs in hunter.*
---
Cancelled my sub. I’ll play for two more weeks then I’m out
---
EST to PST is slower due to the rotation of the earth so that’s not really a fair comparison.
---
Yup. All I can picture in my head is a meme of a hoard of angry people with the caption blizzard fans on reddit. Then right below it all the wow classic servers full with the caption blizzard fans after posting on reddit. I really doubt this will have any impact on Blizzard whatsoever. Blizz con is a month away so everyone will have forgotten this by then. Maybe we will get a question from a fan about it but Blizz is going to be on high alert after last year.
---
This was my thought as well.
---
This isn't really a fair sample, as chilling in Orgrimmar is something that makes sense at 60 and doesn't really at 40 unless you're trying to organize a dungeon.
---
Engineering, but not right away.
---

He's baiting you into popping evasion so he can overpower the shit out of you lol
---
As I rogue I like a challenge.  That's why I never use evasion against warriors.  I know our meaty brethren need all the help they can get.  But I recommend all other Rogues to continue evading!
---
It means the population is high enough at the time that the server has 2 layers.  As people log off it'll go to high which means 1 layer.
---
I have a level 52 priest and a 24 rogue. It's going great
---
The kid.... Not sure haven't seen him in a while
---
&gt;their job is to keep the group up afterall.
---
The healer's job is to heal unavoidable damage, not carelessly self-inflicted damage.  If you're deep in a run and are running low on water the most efficient use of it is to consolidate it on the healer and have them heal the warlock while they tap, but that's about efficiency per drink of water not time efficiency.  For the latter the warlock should be managing their own resources unless the healer has extreme surpluses of mana because while a dearth of damage leads to a longer dungeon, *by far* the most common throttle for dungeon runs is how often you have to wait for the healer to drink.  You're also grossly exaggerating the damage lost by switching into maintenance mode in a dungeon as a warlock.
---
As a warlock you should be expecting your taps to get healed when you're in the middle of a fight, the healer has more mana than is necessary to take care of the actual damage the mobs are going to generate, and the healer has enough breathing room with the tank that they can afford to stop healing them for 4-5 seconds.  You should never expect to be healed between pulls (there are instances where the healer can afford it but you should never bank on it) unless the run is applying so little pressure to the healer's mana that you obviously outgear the content so much that you could use Drain Life as your filler and still blaze through the instance.
---
No, I just was going to get LotP which precludes NS.  Imp Rejuv has nothing to do with that.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295428/classic-realms-layer-update-first-realms-with-a-single-layer
---
It means that those servers still have more than one layer. The rest are down to just 1 persistent world.
---
As a first time WoW player I only used Mods that I felt I needed to and spent the majority of my time exploring and questing with only going into dungeons for quest runs. On one hand I like that we are getting DM because for me, as a Warlock, it means a new place to farm gold and access to my epic mount quest. On the other hand, I'm in my 3rd week of raiding I have not seen anyone (aside from druids and streamers in other servers that speedleveled..) that has more than 3-4 pieces of raid gear. So I really hope that this is them just feeling like Dire Maul should have been there from the start and not the first sign of them rushing content. I have a lot of time to play MMOs but I hate when they pump out content so fast that you need to play every single day because you'll fall behind and then nobody does that part of the content anymore by the time you get there. Take your time, Blizzard. That way we can too.
---
I like you *also*, didn't address government healthcare rationing.
---
Thanks for proving my point bud. Lemme know when your government decides grandma isn't worth keeping alive 👍.
---
It was an exaggeration, but my point is that in *Classic WoW* of all things, it shouldn't be looked down upon to take your time and enjoy things at a slower pace.
---
They hated him because he told them the truth
---
Don’t hold your breath :( 
---
I did the same. I’ve been looking forward to playing classic since many years before the announcement. I didn’t even get to reach 60 god damn it!!
---
**Do it under 30 days now :p**
---
Agree with Achievements. Loved taking a break from leveling or raiding to work on some of the more tedious ones like /love all the critters.
---
Damn dude, that's tragic. you think you'll be alright?
---
What is this contract you speak of?
---
I still dont get why what other people do impacts you. 
---
If content is there that you dont want, then you dont have to play it.  However there are people who want it, so why should they have to wait for content you dont want to/cant access anyway?
---
You dont have to rush, you can still take your time,....
---
I was 60 1 week after the release and even though we rushed it hard, I enjoyed it as well. With that said, we were 5 man at lan party for that entire week which brought the amusement up alot :)
---
But when I chose to lvl my alt up(48 now), I did it the classic way and I enjoyed it just as much if not more, to just chill and play the game as supposed to without stress is a relief. But being 60 as fast as we did, gives you perks that other won't have in terms of farm and AH control :)

You can make a macro for it I believe, I played hunter in vanilla and remember having one that would cast hunter’s mark and send my pet owl Peepers into the fight at the same time.
---
I didn’t play classic but came back to my sub to try. Maybe I’m just a quitter (lol) but seeing how fast everyone else is blowing through the content and already getting full sets of tiers and weapons while I’m struggling like dead ass struggling to level keeps putting me off from playing. Leveling is very slow when you can only play an hour or two a day it starts to feel not worth it if you also want to play at max level. It just shows me that I don’t have enough time for the game and maybe retail is meant for people like me who just wants a quick game here or there. 
---
Guess I’m not a mmorpg guy anymore idk
---
Wanting to hide your talents from other people is actively trolling honestly.

Lol, no.

Ignorance like yours that makes other peoples lives worse is something that should always be pointed out.
---
Duuuuuude(or dudette) how could I forget about necros and DF!! Great times :D
---
Okay I'm going to need this explained to me.
---
So-called casuals are asking for the releases to not come out faster than they did in vanilla.
---
By doing this they are somehow doing what turned the game bad?  They literally just want the release schedule to be realistic and not faster than it originally was.
---
Hard pass on Horde. :)
---
I’ll take a look at Westfall tonight. Went to look at server loads a while ago and now a bunch just say Layered. :/
---
I can't tell whether to keep leveling my hunter (40) or start anew with a druid... I know I like dungeon healing in classic (on a priest alt, at least), but I didn't like raid healing in retail and I suspect it would be the same here. I love retail feral but I know in classic it's very different and much more simple - same with hunter, which I've also raided on in retail. I usually like ranged dps more than melee but I'm not a fan of casters. There are pros and cons to both classes and I'm just completely torn, they come out kind of equal. Suggestions/considerations?
---
That's part of the charm to classic. There will be dicks, and there will be awesome people.    
---
There will be entire groups who know what they are doing, and there will be learning experiences.    
---
Using chat to find people, and put together a group requires you to let each other know your expectations for the dungeon, ask for help, share tips etc. Then you go to the dungeon, possibly fighting the other faction or waves of elites just to get it. You grind through the dungeon and complete it, maybe wiping a couple times, and it feels like an accomplishment.    
---
Sometimes things won't work out but there's no good without the bad. With out the bad everything else is just...expected, mediocre, par for the course. Clearing a dungeon becomes just that.    
---
If you have everyone sitting in cities waiting for a tool to put them in a group and a pop up to click to get you inside the dungeon, you lose so much of that. As soon as there is any sign someone might die or the group might wipe, people either quit and port back to the city to find a new group, or kick some one out and port someone else in. There's no need for the group to talk or work things out, there's no commitment to the group. When forming a group isn't a chore, the group doesn't try. The first sign of having to put in more effort than someone thinks they should, they bail and try to find something easier. And all the while, since everyone is just sitting in a city waiting for the tool to find a group, there are so much less people outside doing things while they form groups.    
---
I can get why some people would rather have the LFG tool, the reasons are valid. To me, I don't want it. To me, it makes for a very different game. And I know a lot of people agree. We just want a game where the LFG doesn't exist.    
---
And that is my dissertation on LFG
---
Some guy came up to me earlier and demanded 5 silver so he could buy his skills. Got really shirty when I told him to grind a few humanoid mobs for it. I’m amazed how some people can approach one with a rude, expectant and unapologetic manner and expect to get what they want.
---
Even so. It would take a major portion of the western player base to depart to make enough of an impact to go against China here.
---
Except for, you know, the HK farmers camping BRM on reset night.
---
It took me a bit to get it and only thanks to your comment :D
---
I agree, but there's a difference here. We can easily stop playing WoW and find other games to play. However, you can't stop eating food or wearing clothing, for example. And the food and clothing that is made ethically is often way more expensive, so even if you wanted to support it, many simply can't, and a lot of ethical brands are just lesser known/smaller brands of the bigger companies, so you're still supporting them. Doesn't really make you a hypocrite; we have to live in the world we live in... until people actually start trying to change things, which a lot of people are weirdly against. Unfortunately, there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. Don't call these people out for doing what they can do under the system.
---
I literally just gave you an example of how it can affect someone who doesn't rush. I don't personally care that much, I was just pointing out that there are some effects.
---
You can’t get it without a group.  All the other stuff you can mine or herb solo.  Everyone rolling is the norm.  If you think only skinners get it that’s fine discuss it with the group leader/group before it starts maybe they don’t care.  Whenever I lead groups in vanilla there was maybe once or twice someone wanted to reserve it (before the run started) and I would just boot them out and tell them to run it solo then.  And when the runs over if there were “no skinners” I would boot everyone “waiting around” to prevent them from going back to the corpse solo.
---
This. Blizz plz.
---
Actually super easy on a priest, easier than a warlock IMO. Facetank goblin with a shield and do priest things. Princess you kite the same as a warlock and proc her dust field with a shield rather than VW.
---
If you do that in a solo pull, fine, but it is the wrong way to play in a 5 man dungeon.
---
YOU might not find it a problem, however you are making your tank's and healer's life more difficult that it should be.   The tank wont have as much rage due to not being hit due to you pulling aggro.  
---
You think you are being super pro with your novas and COC dont you?  Position those mobs right where you want them then blizzard away... you need to understand HOW BAD THAT IS!  ITS FKN BAD BRO.  REALLY BAD.  DONT.
---
You are screwing up the group placement that the tank is trying to achieve.  He is trying to group up mobs in a tight group in a specific spot and you just go an freeze them all over the show.  Now they can't all hit him as they are frozen out of range, costing the tank rage.   Less rage means less damage means less threat means the DPS can do less damage.
---
You wanna be a good mage in a regular 5 man?  focus fire the goddamn skull.  You wanna aoe farm then thats a different dungeon group with a specific purpose and play style and consequently tank style and requirements.
---
So while it seems from your perspective as if you are doing a great job, being and effective mage and blah blah, as someone who has played for countless hours as a mage and a tank, you are not.  You are the second worst kind of mage, the worst being one who does exactly what you do but starts even earlier.
---
You positive they're not using stormstrike?
---
it really dont matter when you think about it since i was willing to roll with the skinners? so its actually the exact same result. Peoples greed made it what it was.
---
Looking good man! Congrats. I really like it.
---
I’m level 28 as of last night. Going to take forever for me to get to 40. I need a grandparents sleepover weekend soon! 
---
To be fair I have been switching between a few characters. I’d probably be 40 or so I think if I stuck to one.
---
I'm still stuck deciding what I want to play highest level I have is 13 lol
---
As a part time investor with a bit of atvi stock...  BLIZZARD STAY OUT OF POLITICS YOU DUMB SONS OF BITCHES.
---
Okay well after years of waiting for WoW Classic I'm now deleting my account. Disappointing but even more disappointing is that Blizzard would do something this... well, evil. Really not a good look for them at the very least.
---
I buy Warlock services
---
yea it's not really Classic when Blizzard of 15 years ago wouldn't have bent the knee to China like this
---
awesome help thanx
---
dark iron ore u cant farm solo lol.
---
Okay high school seems plausible. Most adults will avoid getting into physical altercations and this is someone who boxed for 13 years and taught for 3.
---
OMG so much clicking happens on this toon.
---
I just did it too, thanks for putting the idea in my head. It's not much but it was the right thing to do.
---
Rogue is unfortunately one of the only classes who can’t farm DM effectively
---
Same boat. I play after the kid is in bed, it sort of replaced Netflix or wasting time on Reddit. You just have to change your goals, rather than end game - it's just the game. I may never actually hit 60 in reality, and that's okay. Classic is much more suited to the idea of the journey not the destination
---
Flying mounts are by FAAAR a much larger aspect that limits social interaction and leads to empty worlds...pretty sure walking to a dungeon is pretty far down on that list.
---
I mean, if you like dungeon finder then retail is still there waiting for you at no additional cost.
---
Classic is for everything but dungeon finder and small raids.
---
Fuck anyone of you who still support blizzard
---
Yeah for sure!
---
Enjoy it at your pace, but don’t limit other people’s content releases if you decide to be slower than the average player
---
The general consensus is to keep your pet on passive, and I have /petattack macro'd to some of my abilities that I'm only casting on my focus target (hunter's mark is a great example), or I just have it keybound to something on its own that I can hit while I start to cast other shit. Leaving pet on defensive can be handy when just questing though... saved me a couple times while afk or pulled a mob off me when I was just trying to run by and ignore it.
---
HOLY DAMN GOD that took me like 15 minutes to get it !!!
---
they get \[Overpower\]ed
---
thank me later :D
---
Id be willing to bet most players want them to rush to phase 3 for battlegrounds.
---
No one is mad about this because they hate China as a country. It's about capitulating to foreign pressure to censor players speaking out about human rights abuses.
---
Do you follow people with reusable shopping bags around and criticize their every purchase for not being fully "green"?
---
Your logic is terrible and your incessant repetition is convincing no one to stop doing the right thing.
---
I'm rolling a melee hunter Lol!

Come at me brah!! /hide
---
Fuck that guy. Good for you op
---
Transmogs. As a lvl 50 lock I still haven't completed my Enchanted gold bloodrobe, and probably never will. It would just take up more of my limited inventory space. I would love to be able to wear it, along with my growing collection of other unique, awesome looking outfits, but I won't ever get the chance.
---
Many reasons. 
---
You have more interaction between higher and lower level players. 
---
Lots of world PvP battles are born from multiple opposing groups both making their way to a dungeon. This is really fun for some people. 
---
It makes the world feel a lot more alive, seeing players in transit to their dungeons. More people on boats, more people riding through towns, more people you pass on the roads. The general feeling of a living community that you actually get to SEE. 
---
You have classes like Warlocks that have teleport, being able to teleport party memebers makes them so useful. 
---
Mounts. It makes mounts so much more important and you get a much greater sense of reward from obtaining one. Not to mention, it makes Paladins Warlocks, Druids, Shamans and Hunters more useful because of their mobility talents. 
---
It also changes the dynamic of dungeons. When groups are harder to find, and dungeons harder to get to, PEOPLE DON'T QUIT! If its easy to start a dungeon it's easy to quit one.
---
Never said I tested it. I was just looking at my combat log to see how I died so fast. And a warrior crit me for a buttload....I also remember when the bug was reported and the following hotfix. I just don't want to do research. Feel free to believe it's still broken and that's why priest are unfair
---
Yes we do.
---
Deleted all my blizzard games. Fucking cowards.
---
Tencent owns 5% of Activision-Blizzard.
---
cheers for that :)
---
It’s like this whole Rock Paper Scissors thing wasn’t just a coincidence.
---
Please cite the source that blizz makes “80% of its money” from China, as the last repeat I saw said something in the vicinity of 11%.
---
My only question is that quite a few guilds have already cleared MC, so isn’t all the DM gear irrelevant to them now?
---
So what about Government for dolling out political power to politicians?

Seems the only real advantage Druid has over Hunter for you is the fact that you can heal 5 man Dungeons. Eventually, you won't be doing much of that. If you enjoy ranged DPS and not caster, you are describing a Hunter.

Anyone remember back in the prime WoW years when vanilla-wotlk was our people would constantly be wondering what would be the “WoW killer”? Turns out it was blizzard and their greed all along, to me that’s poetic justice. It’s really sad to see what the company turned into though, they were one, if not *the* most player friendly company back in the early days. How times have changed. Once MoP came out I knew right then that they were catering to the Chinese market and would start bending over backwards for them so I cancelled my sub before mop came out. Fuck you blizzard
---
Yea... I havent gotten home to do it yet but... even thinking about this being the real good bye hurts. It's just a stupid fucking game but goddamn a game that's been with me through high school, through failing college, through every relationship. WoW was the only thing that persisted for that long in my life. I never thought it would end this way. I figured the game would always just drift further away from what I loved and I would eventually just no longer be on, no longer interested. I never imagined it would be something like this.

I like thinking about how worked up people get.

Dear Target,

Fuck you for cancelling my pre order days before it was supposed to ship

It’s also worth mentioning that McDonald’s was well aware that they were serving coffee at dangerous temperatures. There were multiple injuries to employees and guests, complaints that it was too hot, and it was being served well above their standard operating procedure and training manuals stated. This wasn’t a matter of “oops I spilt hot coffee on myself” it was a matter of something being negligently served after it was known to be dangerous.

The woman also originally was seeking just her medical bills (I believe $6,000). McDonald’s ran such a great PR campaign around it that people still view it as absurd law suits all this time later.

Dude I feel ya. You will get there though and it feels great. I’ve been playing for about an hour a night once kids go to bed. Gotta be up very early so I just can’t stay up and grind like I used to. Now on Fridays and saturdays late nights are a must lol. I don’t think I will ever raid though. Truly just in it for when BG’s come back.

Ey listen im all for the illusion of freedom but none of this has anything to do with blizzard, if they wanted to get involved they would have payed someone to write up a speech and got an attractive inoffensive person to read it on a nice expensive set right?   or got all the staff armed up with armalite rifles and thier massive .223 rounds and invaded china themselves lmao.
---
my point is blizzard was trying to host a hs event and not get involved, im all for the protesters and wish them all the best and hope no one ends up getting hurt, but its totally irrelivant, blizzard didnt want in, this guy got them involved and he got the boot.  i dont understand why everyone on here is saying about quiting wow over it?

Also, wolf fangs protrude from the bottom jaw, not the top.

What is there to address? It's a pointless "what-if?" Do you have examples of it happening? The government doesn't even have the ability to make patient outcome decisions in our system. 
---
But keep your talking points bud. Your entire argument has been empty statements, what-if scenarios, and actually refusing to accept any counter evidence. You are the paragon of facts and logic. Ben Shapiro would be proud.

Peace.

i'm a level 47 mage and doubting where to quest, do i hit up Hinterlands? I've done Badlands &amp; Tanaris.

Or you can just say sorry and boot them?

"as many coyotes as there are crocolisks in Dustwallow?"

"oh, oh no, that is taking it a bit far."

it sucks and has always. Use it if you cant drop aggro or FD resists.

How long did it take you to get the necessary faction?
