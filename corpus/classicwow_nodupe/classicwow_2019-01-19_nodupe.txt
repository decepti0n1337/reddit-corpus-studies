To get R14 on a rogue, its gonna be a rough ones bois
---
---
---
Easy answer: It's insignificant. 
---

---
Not so easy answer: being a human provides you more gearing flexibility, and in some situations it's more profitable to equip other items like Devilsaur Set instead of Edgemasters as human and vice-versa. Warrior gearing is a huge playground depending on your world buffs/buffs/the stat interplay of items you already own. And being a non-orc/non-human sort of forces you to obtain Edgies if you do not want to fall behind unless you manage to find another tricky solutions like Hakkari Warblade. You are never likely going to beat human warriors assuming an "ideal fight" situation and assuming that both of you are using optimal gear, but you can get really close (probably around 1% difference) in certain situations.

I love the convenience of setting my hearth to Org. When I hearth back I liked to be able to train class and all professions skills, and dump stuff in the bank. Since I quest a lot on the other continent it's great to have a port back in case some guildies throw together a dungeon run on that side.
---
Why 49?
---
What class and race? 
---
Damn, thanks for sharing! Very short but very thorough!
---
I acknowledge that crusader isn’t the best but honestly I’m gonna put that for style points. Crusader is synonymous with twink for me. That’s literally the only thing I would compromise BiS on. I just really adore the visuals of the crusader proc and love it.
---
I made 100k last year and a few of my mates are now millionairs from crypto, sorry who's low IQ?
---
[removed]
---
&gt;Wait does that mean that you have to pay for *classic* if you want to just play *retail*?
---
ftfy
---
I want to have a human paladin with an arcanite reaper 
---
I played as a human warlock in vanilla. I was in a raiding guild that progressed from MC/Ony, through BWL, ZG and parts of AQ before breaking up. I was always top 3 damage and made Field Marshal (rank 13) pretty much queuing up solo. I played through BC, and came back for parts of WotLK and Cata. Not a fan of the current game and have zero plans on playing it. 
---
I wanna do some casuhard raiding and pvp in classic. I’d like to be either an undead shadow priest or orc warrior. I understand I’d have to go holy pretty much until Naxx to raid. Warriors, on the other hand, are at the top of the dmg parses pretty much through Naxx (when they drop into 2nd). I’ve tanked, melee/ranged dps’d and healed a bunch, so I’m cool w any role. Curious about trying out other vanilla classes, but that’s what I’m feeling like right now. Probably gonna go engineering/mining for professions. 
---
Ain't no "considering" about it. Ima' have a veritable herd of tauren come Classic. GLORIOUS BOVINE MASTER RACE!
---
That argument makes sense in theory until you realize that the hate stems from players who have stopped drinking the cool aid and have realized that Retail is just there to suck money out of them, keeping the carrot on the stick as long as possible to benefit shareholders. This reality has gotten steadily worse over the years to the point where, since BFA, I think it's perfectly reasonable to trash retail. Look at Azerite gear, its pure function Is to keep players constantly having to grind out new gear with no real purpose other than to keep subscriber numbers artificially, the game has ceased to be about fun and is now activisions money horse. Sure some players might enjoy being strung along but don't be surprised when people are toxic about it 
---
I've always wanted a legendary when they're relevant so I hope to get thunderfury in classic but its probably gonna be impossible for me since I'll be playing a rogue.
---
I leveled multiple warriors on various classic servers and decided to play a rogue when Ely**** launched and now I can't go back to warriors. Rogues are just so much more fun for me
---
No worries, we are pretty laid-back and will not expect/require 100% raid attendance. I'll PM you our flyer from the Classic WoW Guilds discord.
---
My goal is to play a character that I have fun going out into the world and experiencing the world.
---
Exploring, farming, and trying new approaches to farming gold (even if they are less efficient).
---
I also want to raid at least one of the classic raids all the way through.  Thinking I’m excited to see MC for the first time and maybe even ZG.
---
you already know the answer. when given the choice between troll and anything else, the right answer is always troll.
---
Tbh, i havn't even twinked yet. I'm lvl 18 (Only need Fishing hat and Pagle).
---
I just went for all the items before 19 (because u cant stop the exp)
---
But what i imagine i will do is use shadowfang + health vs other twink bg's and if not a lot of twinks in the bg i will use ass + max agi (for max 1 shot with ambush) i also bought every item you can use as a rogue, 30 items. (1 of them BOP and the mobs that drop it is lvl 14-15 and u get exp so in theory 29 items - 28 without the pirate costume one)
---
Some of them you can't really "use " since its like 4g each use and that's just to much unless you have a rival that u just want to kill really badly ofc :D
---
horde doesn't need fear ward as much, so trolls are essentially the horde pve race for priest, even more so if shit hits the fan... berserking can easily be a lifesaver.
---
they're also basically the best race for shadow/tri-spec pvp, thanks to their racial spells, though undead are better (and safer) pvp healers imho.
---
Awesome, we'd love to have you! Check out the subreddit posts to stay up to date.
---
It's not just WoW. Go visit any video sub of a game that isn't the lead in its genre. You see so many salty posts about how their game is better and only casuals or morons play the mainstream game. It's so annoying and a huge turnoff for the community.
---
&gt;A pet would have to have an attack speed of 1.6 or lower to statistically have the buff up 100% of the time, then. 
---
That's not how it works, you might expect one crit every 8s with a 1.6s pet and 20% crit chance, however that isn't the same thing as having 100% uptime at all as each attack is independent of the previous one.
---
Even a 1.0s attack speed will not give 100% uptime over an extended period of time on a stationary target, as unlucky streaks happen.
---
Yeah the CA specific PG exam is all about CA laws, regulations, and public safety. Almost feels like taking the bar exam lol 
---
Hydraxion rep will be fun to grind in time..... .it would take multiple no lifers and some serious coordinating to achieve but it's possible
---
&gt; all of that stuff takes time
---
I changed jobs from where I parked in the parking lot and took the lift to the office to one where I parked right outside the front door.
---
5 minutes a trip, 10 minutes a day, nearly an hour every week.
---
So yeah, shit add ups fast.
---
Warlocks aren't threat capped prior to Lupos getting nerfed anyway.
---
Of course there will be bots, especially since we're not doing tokens so they'll be more available than otherwise.  WoW is a social and progression based game so I think you're only hurting yourself but to each their own.
---
Agreed on some of it. That said, the LFD thing is kind of bullshit, and you also seem to ignore that these two itterations are completely different games. The people who want classic want it because it was a game that required more time, and also required you to interact with a community. That doesn't exist these days. LFD is a huge reason for that. To say it was a boon is subjective. It was good for those people who couldn't interact with the community as much, and yes it was good for getting into an instance if you didn't have time. But by doing it cross server to speed it up, it pretty much killed any sense of community. People who say LFD was bad aren't saying it 'because it sucks' but because it was a system that ruined the game for them. And thats valid. 
---
You might not realize this, but the sub base is not the same one as back then. To say it was a boon for the community is untrue. It lead to millions of people quiting, it just also happened that the changes enticed people to fill their slots. So don't sit here like those who hate on LFD are just whining. 
---
You also are very much labeling everyone here who has any issue with the way BFA as someone who is just a pointless baby. Some people on here are toxic, but lots of people who say those things you just ripped on are genuinely people who just want the old game back, because it was more fun to them. 
---
I personally take a while to "warm up" and start playing, so I take advantage of that time to fly back and plan out what I'll be doing and make it efficient, also read the quest logs because the previous day I picked up the quests, hearthed and logged off.
---
it goes both ways. Retail fans rip and are complete assholes to those who want vanilla. In general, I just find that the world of warcraft community on reddit (retail, classic, and private servers) are just filled with the shittiest of people. Most people dont care. Its just the vocal assholes you remember, and each group has them
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Why? Unless you were tax-loss harvesting.... Depending on when you bought it, all you would be doing is lowering your cost basis which will just mean you will pay more in taxes when you eventually sell not to mention the trading fees. Just seems inefficient if you want to hold long.
---
While true at the time, the knowledge level is much higher today. Someone going in now with the mindset of "BiS didn't exist in 2005, so nobody will care about it now and I don't need to look those up or care" might be mislead. BIS lists and specs are readily available for everyone.
---
But importantly, I think the game will be more goal-focused. A lot of casual raiders in WoW vanilla didn't have raiding as their goal. The game was so damn popular, that a lot of us just played and eventually found ourselves at level 60, looking for things to do. I don't think there will be as many people making it to 60 aimlessly and finding casual raiding where people don't really care if they clear content.
---
"Casual" in terms of time investment: yes. "Casual" in terms of not caring if people are playing badly, wrong spec, bad items, not knowing their gear or the fights, etc? I don't think so.
---
fun in PvP. That’s the only reason to play it really. 
---
Vanilla had a breadth of knowledge and the community fell across the entire thing. Classic's breadth of knowledge is just bigger, but the Classic community will still fall across the entire thing which means you're going to have a large group of the community that knows as little or almost as little about the game that the Vanilla community did back in the day.
---
Yes, the top end is higher but it's smaller and you're still going to have the lower and middle tier players (which is where the majority of Classic players will fall)
---
Rogues and Hunters look good as they use full tier, Priests look ok as well.
---
Tanks look fine in defensive gear, in TPS gear they are basically fury warriors.
---
Notice I didn’t say it tops the chart in Raids.
---
It is more of a Horde thing, DW pulls ahead a lot easier on Alliance.
---
Buh
---
Dude its the internet. Whar did you expect
---
I've always wanted to get full (or near full) tier 3. Then I would spend most of my time running around world PvPing and burning massive amounts of consumables. 
---
So you're going to sell it for a loss now, and buy it back at a further loss later once the prices go back up?
---
Great plan! 
---
depends on the tank i guess, but in my experience warlocks overaggro a fuck ton
---
Why would't you wait to sell until the trade war is resolved and the government re-opens...?
---
I mail everything to bank alt, at times my partner had an account so id mail it there and ah while flying places.
---
TB is a good city while leveling as ckass and prof trainers are pretty close compared to org and uc.
---
Found booty bay good coz bank, boat to ratchet, zep to uc and org to be most central to everything. 
---
When I was younger I saved all my allowance to buy gold for an epic mount and I rode that baby with pride. A swift palomino.
---
Once classic comes out I'm gonna be a huntard and solo everything my warrior of old could not. Gonna get enough gold to buy my own epic mount.
---
Thats what I'm most looking forward to! That, and being able to run all the dungeons again from a non-tank perspective. 
---
It does depend on the tank however Warlocks don't really get going until ZG releases.
---
If a Warlock is pushing threat prior to that I would be making sure the tank knew what they were doing with basic stuff like priority lists, consumables and not wearing full t1 or t2 for every single boss.
---
My goal is to level slowly and enjoy the game! Then at 60 I would like to raid at least MC/onyxia
---
highest level for the bracket, I prefer the 10 - 19 bracket myself
---
you horde or ally? inbox me and ill add you
---
Same for VA. Had to study mineralogy, I  had forgotten it 
---
Oops, only you can. I've been doing it since vanilla. Tip: the shared auction house.
---
Most people will play both factions with few exceptions. Classic will be released with no end in sight... People have the next several years to play both sides.
---
I’ll just play an undead 😂
---
Ah, the old Buy High and Sell Low strategy!
---
obviously the thing to do wouldve been to hold on til classic if you think its gonna raise.....but you dont seem very smart
---
Fury with shield, or dual wielding? I've heard about tanks dual wield tanking some bosses for threat, but I assumed they were tank specced and in defensive stance
---
If you are playing this character at launch, getting a wand even at levels 10-14 is not easy or likely. If you buy a wand it'll drain a lot of your money you need to buy spells.
---
For these reasons I tend to go Spirit Tap on a fresh server with my first character. If the server is older, or it's your second character, just buy a wand ASAP and put the talents into the wand spec. Low level wand DPS is insane and resource-less. 
---
hahaha... Oh my... There is SO much to unpack here...
---
We had a suicide-dkp system and people would pass on minor upgrades all the time and watch them get DE'd or go to someone with 0 dkp to vendor.
---
Suicide systems fail at "I kinda want it but not really".
---
I can guarantee you this will happen
---
Serious question.
---
Do Druids have glancing blows? And if so can they get rid of them like other classes can?
---
Oof, til death do you part ftl.
---
(jk, get them SoC procs)
---
Scroll up or scroll down?
---
A lot rides on this answer.
---
A lot of people on established servers. You could make unreal gold back in BC / WOTLK on established servers for the original version of common names like Ninja, Hunter, Gun... Etc etc etc. A guy in my guild on Tichondrius paid well over 50k gold for the name Sandwich. Its not for everyone, I certainly wouldnt do it, but it is a thing. That being said, no one is paying for Frank, Dave or Bob.
---
That's my moment right there from back in 2004. The very first time I made it to Org. I felt like I belonged to something so amazing and the only way to express it was to go to the throne room and kneel before my Liege Lord.
---
Fury with Defiance in def stance (mostly).
---
They run DW but will swap in the shield if they are getting spiked or the fight requires it.
---
It's a strat that benefits heavily from world buffs as they really want the extra health to survive and the extra Crit/AP as they (from what I recall) still care a little for defensive stats (health/armor).
---
Enrage gives them a large boost as well from intentionally taking crits to proc it, which probably won't be a thing in Classic but there's not great documentation on this back then.
---
My friends don't play
---
That's so stupid. I would never use a name that I didn't create myself. Even the name I use on Reddit right now is a mashup of my old two names I created.
---
well, it depends... what you have to ask yourself is this: do you want to play an abomination, barely able to walk like a man, with misshapen limbs, and grotesque a face, with their nature just as monstrous, or a troll?
---
I'll have a list of well over 20-30 names and cycle through them. Starting with the names I want and then focusing on reserve names for friends / sale in the future.
---
Where there is a fetish there is a way 
---
You don't need 7 days /played to reach 6p, especially if you done it already and have it routed. 
---
You mean 1 Hour Average wait time just to do a Horde Battleground in Classic WoW? 
---
  
---
Did you even play Classic WoW?
---
Government job with hundreds of banked hours and vacation time. I am currently on vacation from Jan 3rd - 30th because I had to take time or my bank was going to be paid out. More time on my hands then I know what to do with... Also have my own small business and a few rental properties. I sorta work because I like to work. When I dont wanna work, I just dont.
---
Phoenix is way better than Uthgard. Fixes everything wrong with Uthgard.
---
I think .~-=GRIND=-~. would suit you more...
---
Fair enough, Pal is quality in PvP
---
Right? I live in the DFW area as well :p
---
Aren't you worried that you will feel like a traitor?
---
Thats fair. I certainly wouldnt pay for a name either. That being said, it has a lot to do with your perspective. Many people would shutter with cringe at a name like Maluxorath... Has the stench of RP all over it. Has about as much creativity as slamming the "randomize" button 5-6 times. But everyone has their own preferences I guess. I have sold names in the past but never purchased one. As far as I know it isnt really a thing in retail anymore with cross realm because people just find a realm where it isnt taken.
---
Had a NE Hunted named Ryan. Private Ryan. ;]
---
Love this!
---
&gt; Pokimainhand
---
&gt; 
---
I can just sense a truly horrible pun hiding behind this one and I just can't seem to grasp it. gimme a hand here.
---
The game has "existed" in one form or another for 15 years. There will be small nuances that will shift some specific details around slightly but yes, pserver guides will rule, and you will not only see a lot of people with 15 years of experience in the game bring it to classic, but their knowledge will influence a lot of people who may not know all of that stuff yet. The game isn't new.
---
Vanilla through wotlk I was in high school then college and was in a successful guild. Now I travel for business all the time and even if I did want to raid with my guild I'm probably in the wrong time zone. I'll just be a casual in classic and probably cap out at bwl at best. Probably not even that far really.
---
are priests fun to play? I trailed a shadow priest on a pvserver but im not sure if I want to go warlock instead
---
Getting to 60 on my first character took something like 12 to 14 days played. It's definitely about the journey.
---
&gt;The game isn't new.
---
Exactly. The experience the Pserver community brings is relevant and will matter. Not that OP should worry... All of that information will be available to him through guides, addons and content creators. If OP doesnt want that information I'm not really sure what his expectations were... The game is not new. You were never going to have an authentic vanilla wow experience like we had when we were entirely oblivious...
---
That was really cool ! Almost felt like i was back there in elwynn as i listened to the video :)
---
play both mages for maximum faceroll
---
suck it hordie, you will die by my hand!
---
but malfurion banging a the queen of the night elves,and orcs is chopping down the trees
---
and I know it hadn't happened in classic yet, but the horde burn down a world tree and malfurion starts ripping out horde jugular in darkshore
---
&gt; Anyone else feel this way or am I over thinking it? 
---
No... You will be at a competitive disadvantage if you are not as versed with the game as the private server community. If that matters to you (it wont to most) then you should go prepare. Otherwise enjoy the game at your own pace. Regardless of you reading guides, using addons, etc etc, the private server community WILL impose the meta and the meta WILL impact your experience. Whether you are using some form of help or not, and you are looking for a quest item, that private server guy will run by you and immediately pickup the object you were searching for, which will lead you to its location. When you are doing subpar in a dungeon, that private server guy WILL link the damage meter, WILL tell you whats wrong with your itemization, WILL tell you what is NOT optimal about your spec and you WILL be informed which is NOT the experience you would have had during retail vanilla.
---
“Make your faction proud” lol yeah, so much great faction content in classic... 
---
Or you could just log off at the inn in the closest town after turning in a round of completed quests like someone with a brain.
---
They've already had major losses since red October and the bungie split docked em 8%.
---
Now is the time to buy in anticipation for the launch, not sell.
---
I would sell almost immediately after classic too because if they dont fuck it up like their track record says they will the hype will die fast.
---
Also consider that since they're joint classic edition will probably yield a significantly small portion of subscription fees added compared to COD and Candy crush.
---
It's too small to matter
---
I do stocks! Im an investooooor!!!!
---
Just follow your heart and main Horde. Spirits be with you, mon.
---
You can always play an Ally alt and experience the other side later on, without fully commiting your play experience to something you might not feel in sync with.
---
What the fuck? The stock is at a year low and you're selling it? Jesus fucking Christ.
---
39 enhance shaman is the poor man's unbreakable and just as fun IMO.
---
Turnover, the greatest way to go out poor. 
---
[try looking around here.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twinking_guides) most of it is for TBC, but more-or-less remains applicable to classic.
---
I'm just assuming the reason for you to make this thread, but if you want to play a NE warrior, go for it. Unless you plan on joining a top tier guild that wants to get server first, you won't have more trouble getting into raids if you are a well geared, decent fury warrior simply for being a NE and not a human. Don't force yourself to stick to a character for all the game's content because of a racial, you'll grow.tired of it super fast.
---
Absolutely obliterating the Horde and just in general make hordies squeal because they always think they are top shit
---
&gt; deal with it brah.
---
I mained a Human Priest healer throughout WoW.  In Classic, I will roll Dwarf simply because of Fear Ward.  
---
Well, I hope you bought recently so you at least sold for a small profit.
---
I love Tauren but am sad that they are so limited by class. Gonna make my priest a Troll. Or maybe learn to love druid/shaman. 
---
While questing, having hearth set to a point like menethil or auberdine (or bb or ratchet) gives you more flexibility with traveling fast to more locations. Depends on how often you actually need to visit the capital cities, but from my experience that's more like every two levels whereas hearthing is more like every few hours.
---
I am level 32. I have 0 quests to turn in. I am 8 minutes away from an inn.
---
What do?
---
Iirc for glancing blow damage against a L63, 300 is 70%, 305 is 85%, 310 is 95%, 315 is 100%. Something like that. Basically the first 5-10 skill points after 300 are the most important by far. 
---
Also presumptuous of you to think you'll casually get edgemaster's.
---
&gt;once
---
If*
---
You would only get a fast atk speed pet for pvp, indeed.
---
He’s asking about min/maxing, I’m going to safely make the assumption that he plans to find a raid guild and make it through the easy content. 
---
Yes
---
I know. But he said its ONLY good for caster pushback.
---
I didn't realize it was a boar's head until like 2 months after I got it on my warrior
---
Just roll somewhere where they aren't
---
Someone who doesn't already understand +ws and wants to main a melee dps in raids isn't likely to already be lined up with a hardcore raiding guild.
---
Concerning.
---
Sandwich
---
&gt; Retail is just there to suck money out of them
---
And you don't see the irony that you'll be paying the same sub price to play Classic which....?
---
MMO's generally operate on a pay to play basis, that was true in 2004 and now.
---
I don't get this mindset "HAH, RETAIL IS JUST THERE SUCK YOUR WALLET. UNLIKE CLASSIC WHO REQUIRES $15 TO PLAY, NO SIREE NO MONEY SUCKING THERE!"
---
&gt; LFD lead to millions of people quiting
---
Now, THAT is some grade a bullshit. The first DIP in subs for WoW was cataclysm and that's because it was a fairly bad expansion. It had it's ups but in general it was poorly recieved.
---
Then came MoP which stabalized WoW for a while at a healthy 6 or so million.
---
The WORST drop came from WoD which was a HORRID expansion where 'content patches' were a selfie camera and twitter integration.
---
So, the drops have been from shitty expansions, not LFD/LFG.
---
Might want to do your research before spout pure nonsense.
---
A player who has played a class for 10 years will put play any player reading off a guide. No matter how much you help him itemize. 
---
 They already have the raids on farm everyone already knows what to do and how to do it guide or not. They had guides out during vanilla as well doesn't mean we didn't whip 10 times before our first kill. 
---
World bosses you don't even stand a chance against a group that knows exactly when and what to do. Placing silences and dispells are key in the PvP before hand.  I guess unless a streamer and his band off 100 followers all show up to camp it for him. 
---
Give the Afghan military the navy seals guide and just end the war... 
---
Pve or pvp server?
---
r/WowCircleJerk
---
I hope someone will post a list of where all the streamers and private server players are planning to go when the servers come out. 
---
i mainly played 2v2 with my irl buddy as war/rsham and s8 was just absolute garbage for us. the combo was underwhelming by itself but seeing dbw and later shadowmourne on every meele while i couldn't buy the 2.2k weapon from our 2v2 rating was just depressing. i didn't raid back then at all because i couldn't schedule the time. today i think it's kinda cool that you had to raid to get some of the optimal gear. 
---
There is not "proper" way to do WoW. If people enjoy rushing then they can fill their boots. You don't have to do the same.
---
As a shaman, always the closest town where you are questing.
---
Spam that shit 24/7, along with ghost wolf makes leveling really quick.
---
Yeah, but having a strong pve racial has nothing to do with how repulsive looking at a dwarf run is.
---
No, because alliance has no comradely quite like horde does in open world PvP.
---
If you attack horde, every horde player from a 10 mile radius will swarm to attack you.  Vice versa, alliance will just keep walking by most of the time without batting an eye.
---
Who (tank), What (mage), IdontKnow (priest), Why (rogue), Because (Hunter), Tomorrow (Warlock), and IdontCare (Paladin). 
---
Lol dude this is fucking gold. Out of assigned area,  motivation to obtain items. Those devout shoulders bro...make him heal better
---
I think what many of us are trying to day is that retail wow sucks your money by releasing sub par content and pushes microtransactions as much as they can.
---
There is plenty of time to find a guild, you don’t have to have one lined up now....
---
I am with ya, I am can't get it off my mind. At first I thought this will be easy to pick a race/class! but now I have second guessed myself like 15 times.
---
Well, classic is going to have many older more mature player base. That's a fact. And personally, I'm looking forward to that. All the vanilla kids and people who started with vanilla in their 20s are pushing 40 now. 
---
Warriors could not dual wield two handers, it was a single two hander or two one handed weapons.
---
Funny enough though there was a patch that made bows viable on warriors, it lasted a few days before being fixed but long enough to scare hunters who laid claim to every weapon at the time.
---
I’ve mained a rogue from vanilla through mists. For me WoW is my rogue and the ability to sneak around and manipulate the fights I choose to continue!
---
I look forward to seeing my old toon is his true glory, wearing a full set of that vendor leather you get from the gold shire merchant.
---
Many a fond memory of running around Elwynn wearing that set and two stilletos grinding the bandits by the waterfall. Thinking back I really had no idea what I was doing. 
---
Correction, what I meant was 2 one handers but using all of the arms abilites. Later they locked those abilities to 2 handers.
---
Go cowboys!! Also, when tf are they going to be finished with 360 over by six flags?!?
---
Isn’t that what it is?
---
Yes. There aren't any abilities in vanilla that specifically require a 1h or 2h weapon, though there are ones that require a shield.
---
If people didn't want the microtransactions they wouldn't sell would they?
---
That's what you are also not understanding. They push for them, but they're not REQUIRED to buy. 
---
And if someone wants to spend $25 on a mount? Let em, it's their money and their choice. It's not hurting you.
---
Damn, thanks!
---
I think it’s cool too but not when it was THAT op.  It was a literal game changer.  In season 7 I could heal through a warrior with t2 weapons literally until he fell asleep.  The moment I saw my first shadowmourne it was like I was in pve gear with 0 resilience.  Absolutely unbeatable.  
---
Probably never or after I move away lol. Glad I don't drive over there anymore though. In Frisco now! Lol glad to see your spirits up still though about the boys :p

But some people (Not me) only like raiding. Is forcing them to go through all that leveling just to get to raiding a bad idea?  
---
And isn't allowing them to skip the leveling to get straight to the raiding how we end up with retail?
---
That's amazing. I want to pvp for the most part (so I will want mortal strike) but I also want to get into raids so I thought I'd use 2 one handers in arms (dropping the rest of the points in fury) then putting a chain one of the weapons to make myself completely immune to disarms and icy chill on another (which btw works on most raid bosses when it comes to slowing their attack speed). Since people wouldn't be able to inspect my talents I could kinda sell myself maybe XD.
---
PvP my good man
---
Hmmm, so the dips in subs started happening after LFD was introduced, and it is frequently brought up as a huge problem with the game for a large number of people who play, and who have quit. Its almost as if LFD random queue bullshit is a part of why these expansions were shit? But nah, it couldn't be. Afterall, you apparently know what you are talking about, and LFD has only been beneficial to the community according to you.  
---
I apologize if my statement came across as LFD being the sole reason people quit. Not my intention. But what it has done to the game has been a key part to why expansions have sucked. Poor design and content droughts have led to the mass exoduses we see at certain periods. Part of that is the fact that LFD removes any need to foster relationships to keep you playing. The very premise is to make it as easy as possible for you to access content. When you are sitting there farming content while AFK, you get tired of it. This is compounded by shit content. Now you have nothing left to do, and because LFD kills the actual community aspect, there is no reason to not just quit. So yeah, not the sole reason, but it is (and is very frequently cited as) a big reason people have left this game. 
---
Get back everything I've lost, and then get more.
---
Had an enchanter/engineer with every single recipe available prior to AQ40. Really want to get that back again. Also had a Shadow Priest that was working it's way up the BiS list that would be really cool to finish.
---
Very much this.
---
in vanilla no, there is no restriction to weapons as a warrior for melee use, so yes arms abilities can be used with any melee weapon. the downside is mortal strike and overpower are both instant attacks that really benefit from a slower weapon as it has the same dps as a faster weapon but a much higher hit every time it swings, so instants are stronger. this means that 2 handers, being the slowest, are just better for an arms warrior
---
My level 19 Dwarf Hunter who will be named Parts, and will obtain the rank of Private.
---
if you get into a hardcore guild probably not, a dwing arms warrior would do a noticeably less damage than fury, but maybe in a more casual guild. you could also just go horde and make use of windfury as it makes 2handers more viable due to the free instant attacks it gives
---
you clearly havnt played retail wow recently..... its not just microtransactions
---
Microtransactions in a subscription game are disgusting and even if other games are worse, they shouldn’t be accepted imo. 
---
Look at WoD for example, so many mounts went to the store when they could’ve been used incentivize or create more content, which is what the subscription is supposed to be for.
---
I mean they'll be able to see how you are doing dmg from meters. So they will know if bloodthirst isn't on your dmg done meter.
---
But in terms of elitist gameplay you won't be able to raid like that, as you aren't minmaxed and far from it. In terms of semi-hardcore you could probably get away with it.
---
But if you are planning on doing this, do yourself and your raid a favor and use a 2h. You will do significantly more dps as a 2h arms than a dw arms in raids. I typically arms 2h dps and do fine. I beat any fury who aren't minmaxed or aren't super good.
---
If anyone tries to tell you you can't raid however you want though tell them they are an elitist asshole because there is always a guild that'll let you raid with them. But you are restricted to their pace.
---
He enjoys the mage, I'm more of a smack bitches in the face kinda player.
---
I don’t find the dwarf movement unattractive.  What bothers me is when Tauren and Draenei run, they lumber slowly.  Gnomes are too small for me.  I find the Undead and trolls movements awkward as they seem to hobble back and forth.  We all have different perspectives as to what we like and what bothers us. 
---
I won't be able to get into a hardcore guild anyway... I will only have 2-3 hours a day to play due to having a job. I do plan on booking at least 2 weeks off on launch tho.
---
It starts a little slow, but the payoff is worth it :P
---
To get the phone number of that sexy troll that just ran down the beach.
---
Then yeah, semi hard core and just drop the dw, just use the 2h
---
sure, legendaries have no place. 3.3 was the beginning of the end in many ways.
---
I understand that but having disarm immunity in pvp could throw off many people (since everyone who can disarm will try to do that first thing on warriors lol). I'd gladly use a 2h if they take me like that tho. Sadly the min max mentality spread too much and we will get to a point where even casual guilds won't let you raid how you want lol.
---
I think too many people are looking forward to Classic with the mindset of "I'm going to log in on day 1, grind for 48 hour straight, be in the top percent to reach 60, get in a guild of like-minded people and dominate all the content"
---
This is a prime recipe for burnout and disappointment. Classic should be enjoyed slowly because a lot of the highly enjoyable content is found BEFORE hitting level 60.
---
If you rush to 60 and try to compete with the no-lifers then you'll miss half the reason for returning to Classic.
---
I'll be hoping for the name of my original char, +alts.
---
we don't like to use to the term "bitch" in today's flamboyant culture but yes, by all means smack those little rascals around
---
I am going to be running a semi hardcore, that doesn't care what you are as long as you come to play. 
---
Also have a 2nd 2h with chain. It's very easy to see when broke are going to disarm, warriors switch to defense stance, rogues after a parry. Also there are multiple gloves that give disarm immunity
---
Yep, losers will defend their shitty husk of a game because of the sunken cost fallacy. There are always losers who will be happy to live of scraps.
---
r/WoWCircleJerk
---
It's uh... a term of endearment? :D
---
Ah, I didn't even know about them gloves, need to look into those as well. There are just so many unique items that you can make many interesting setups lol.
---
Just put the weapon chain on a 2h if you’re concerned about it, but disarm isn’t prevalent in vanilla. Only Warriors and rogues who spec into riposte will be able to disarm, it’s hardly an issue.
---
Dual Wielding as arms is going to do terrible damage, you’re better off stick with a 2h, ESPECIALLY in PvP.
---
Also, if icy weapon enchant works on bosses, it won’t make the debuff slots most likely, which is limited to 16 in 1.12. It will either get pushed off or the raid leader will tell you not to use it. It’s kind of a cosmetic enchant only at max level, I’d stick with crusader.
---
Oh boy, it's guild #8000 named mediocre, likely as successful as they are original. 
---
I know stronghold gauntlets are like the best pvp warrior gloves you can get early on
---
The biggest problem with Arms raiding is the two debuff slots you're going to take up with Mortal Strike and Deep Wounds. They can't just not be used either because they are a core of your DPS and one of the main reasons for speccing Arms. In casual guilds I think it'll be fine because they won't overly care about prioritising medium debuffs or have the correct class balance to do so in the first place. Semi-hardcore and above will and not take you.
---
4/4 green gloves of the monkey available at 19, beats bristlebark.
---
Tunic of Westfall is better for ally and Seal of Wrynn replaces Sylvannas.
---
I honestly always went Agi, the thing is you get a huge amount of Dodge out of it at such low levels that 8 agi makes a huge difference, to the point it really offsets the endurance you get from more HP. I think I had about 40% dodge on my twink, evasion makes you nigh invinisible to other melee.
---
I believe I've spotted an error. You account for rested xp giving 0.6246% xp per hour. However, you need to subtract the standard resting rate earned when not in a bonus resting area, of 0.15615% xp per hour, and do your calculations based on the comparative increased resting rate of 0.46845% xp per hour instead.
---
Apologies if this was already accounted for in the final math; however I didn't see it mentioned in the initial post.
---
I too hate the macros and add-ons. I remember a boss fight in BWL being extremely easy because of Decursive. And Hunter stings were so easy to counter with Decursive. And yup, those macros make life easier which kind of kills the game.
---
LOL but if we're on a RP server it'll be a letter address.
---
the mathy answer is very easily obtained.
---
 from melee weapon skill 300-310 the glancing blow(40% of all your white hits) formula is changed, normally glances do 70% damage vs a boss, per point of skill giving 3% damage, up to 100%(310). 
---
that alone is worth 12% damage, after taking into account misses, crits and dodges(roughly). there is then also the change to the weapon skill formula for being within 10 levels of the bosses defence skill(315), so getting to 305 changes your hit rating formula to give a bonus 3% hit.
---
when you account for the bonus rage from having higher normal hits and then account for whites being not all of your damage, it is roughly the same as not accounting for either, so this is a 16% or so damage increase at 310 weapon skill. 
---
the last 2 points are only worth a total of 0.4% damage as glancing blow bonus caps at 310 and each point of skill is then only worth 0.2% dmg value at that point. 
---
overall the damage difference between a nelf warr and human warr with both having edgemaster is 9% glancing dmg +0.4%,  so humans have 4% more damage than a nelf with edgemasters
---
I could just not spec deep wounds and not use mortal strike but that would probably gimp me a lot lol.
---
Get sulfuras r14 shaman, had a r14 priest on retail but always wanted a shammy.
---
You, me, and, I
---
I can respect that. I'd like to do that. Make myself a cup of tea, sit down at my computer, crack my knuckles and ease into it. But I also want to start on BiS farming ASAP, so I'll be rushing at the start.
---
Thanks!

That's a weird name. 
---
I mean....you can...nobody's gonna stop you, but the abilities really work better with 2handers. Overpower with a 1hander is mediocre, Deep wounds is based off of wep damage so is poor with 2hander, Sweeping Strikes is a fixed number of swings, so 2handers give you more out of each SS swing, and of course Mortal Strike is the poster child for wanting a nice big slow fatty weapon. Maybe there's some hybrid DW mace build for extra stuns, but you're pretty dependent on randomness when you could just be globaling clothes right off the charge.
---
He's got a pokey (dagger) in his main hand. 
---
Ambush macro is a thing, but i never found it all that useful. Because you cant mount, most of the time youll be running around unstealthed, so most of the time you usually stealth at around 30 yards away, meaning your opponent knows youre coming. With 0 points in +stealth and 0 +speed in stealth (which you should be at 19) its not that easy to actually get an ambush off when your opponent knows youre coming.
---
If you get caught without ambushing, youll be forced to switch weapons, meaning youre probably wasting an energy tick because the GCD will prevent you from getting an SS off.
---
If you get the ambush off, its a decent damage boost initially, but not as much as youd think because you basically trade an auto attack from your Shadowfang to your Assasin's blade switching back, as well as Ambush costing 1 1/2 SS in terms of Energy. The GCD doesnt really matter because youll be low energy anyway in this case.
---
My honest biggest problem with using my Ambush macro is that its a bad idea to just have a weapon switch macrod to stealth. This is because at 19, a lot of your targets wont need to be ambushed at all because youre just going to cream them anyways. A lot of matchups you wont even open in stealth, because you want to unstealth about 5 yards away to close the distance faster. This means youll have to remember each time you actually want to use ambush to switch it to your main hand, which I found too annoying to bother with.

I didn't factor it in. But since I'm nit picking, you're nit picking picked nits :P But good point, though I don't think I'll need to redo the spreadsheets so long as there's a caveat of "if you're on the cusp of rest vs camp, pick camp" - that should accommodate the difference.
---
Or fuck it. I'll redo the math cause that's why I'm here doing this, right?
---
Try /r/wowservers . This subreddit is for discussion of the upcoming Classic Wow not private servers.
---
guys you're bringing the retail mentality into classic by rushing to 60 please chill
---
But see thats my issue I feel like it took forever to get 60 and by the time I do get 60 everyone will put gear me and PvP will be pointless for me. PvE I can always find a guide at my pace, but it always sucked running tier 1 stuff while everyone else is tire 2 or 3 
---
I can barely put into words how amazing this is, awesome work, &amp; plz plz plz moar. 
---
I speak as someone with a passing interest (but no real expertise) in music, and with a huge mass of nostalgia for this great, vast world I explored over a decade ago, with so much of this nostalgia stored in the music that played in the background... and your lively and stimulating approach to unpacking this music is just blissful for me. The way you unpack the Elwynn melody makes me realise that this music really did evoke these particular senses and emotions in me, without me even realising it- until you put it into words. Wonderful stuff!
---
Deep wounds isn't a problem due to how debuff priorities, that the game uses to determine whether one debuff will replace another, work. However mortal strike is a problem and will take the place of a more important debuff so even a semi-hardcore guild wouldn't want you to use mortal strike. Which makes arms dps awful in raids.
---
You can dual wield and use mortal strike, yes.
---
This is almost the same as my list, might be the one you’re refering to. Only shoulders and gloves are different I think (also listed the naxx enchants), the reason i chose Scouting Spaulders is because they take ZG/Naxx enchants and have double the armor, 3 stam is kind of meh. Scouting gloves of the monkey is equal to Bristlebark gloves, and Ghoul Fingers are almost as good. They also look alot better!
---
Played mage in vanilla. Had a rogue friend with whatever talent makes sap more effective. People may say sap is bad compared to poly, but having both was really nice while running those 5 mans and not knowing wtf we're doing. Our group was typically rogue/mage/lock/warriors/rdruid.
---
Once  we figured out how to pull a group back into clear areas to accommodate using fear, having a sap, sheep, fear, stunned and rooted targets made things much much simpler.
---
about as original as some reddit troll shit posting for no reason
---
Upvoted for Artorias.
---
I wouldn’t tie a weapon swap to a function as routine as stealth. I would want to manually equip the assassin via hot key at my discretion and re-equip shadowfang after ambush. Thanks for the info
---
Tauren shaman named torrak. Didn't know about the totem quests until lvl 36 when someone mentioned it to me lol. 
---
You do realise that hunters only have to kite mobs for 1-10 right? After that they have pets. I'm not claiming Joana is the best player, but you're only going to save like 15-30 minutes via this optimisation tops because most of your /played time is 10-60.
---
If your raid group is failing at a boss and they are blaming a 5 weapon skill difference on the warriors, your raid has problems. 
---
All the popular streamer names.
---
Hate to break it to you, but bindings will always go to the main tank first.
---
Real advice for hunters: Get a pet you like, it doesnt matter what it is, just get one you really like. I like bears, i like to get bears for pets, they are cool. At 60 hunter dps pretty much plateaus at MC, and the DPS provided by the pet is minimal anyways. 
---
This sub really has turned to shit. The mental gymnastic when the game is released and people remember what Vanilla was will be epic. 
---
"But but, you can dance on the top of the bank!"
---
kick names, take ass
---
Yes, charge puts you in combat, charge applies a stun (or attempts to if the target resists) and that counts as combat initiation.
---
There are abilities that require you to have a weapon equiped - basically rendering them useless if someone were to for instance; disarm you temporarilly. 
---
Just go in blind.
---
For some reason people have this idea that if they dont get to 60 within the first month, that their chance of raiding at 60 becomes 0, this could not be further from the truth.
---
I am currently unable to invest time on retail which will become irrelevant in a few months with the next extension. 
---
But I can’t wait for classic to come and stay forever in Azeroth! 
---
Do you know of any similar Alliance communities? 
---
But we want it to be stuck like that! I cannot invest my few hours of gaming a week into retail that will become irrelevant at the next patch or extensions. 
---
Character name - thattimeofthe**moo**nth
---
People who play more are going to outgear you no matter what. That was always true, it still is in current wow content. Blizzard will release raids in successive waves, though, so if you're not too slow, you can catch up eventually before the next wave comes. 
---
Sometimes I think I’m the only person in the world that plays with game music on 90% of the time instead of Spotify or something
---
Naxx enchants are called Death’s Embrace and Might of the Scourge. Ofc ZG, AQ and Naxx isn’t available at launch so we’ll have to wait for those formulas/enchants.
---
Accepting casuals? 
---
The Tuxedo requires lvl 35 in classic I’m afraid, would be nice for TBC though.
---
Lists or some variant of them existed then too.  You just needed to know where to look. 
---
I'd rather take a feral druid than this loool
---
We don't mind having people around as casuals and/or focussed on pvp. That being said we still expect the same social standards from them (see policies)
---
I'd pay for the names I want if they were taken.  
---
There will be a guild for everyone.  
---
One of my favorite parts on raid nights is when Zeroz would just tear into his brother on how fat he was.  
---
Don't forget Private Parts
---
Yeah. I'm all for mounts being a reward for hard work. But just buying them sort of ruins the game. In my opinion
---
Hmm ok, thanks for the explanation
---
What a mediocre response
---
Depends on how accurate they are. The fact that the nostalrius devs got laughed at regarding their accuracy of some raids gives me hope. 
---
The hope is we get a closer vanilla experience and not some ez mode version.  Whether it is 1.12 or the accuracy, i couldn't care less. 
---
You can get over 300 mounts ingame without ever touching the store, so that kinda defeats your point.
---
Understood. With my job, I can't commit to raiding. I do plan on being a helping hand in a guild, just can't tell ahead of time if I will be available certain times. I'm more than willing to be a stand in, when able to fill a spot. Pvp, 5 and 10 mans will be my main diet. 
---
ye sure, leveling a priest is good anyways :) but with quiver speed and /sit it'd be even more comfortable
---
Lol. Slow down there buddy.  You can speak for your generation, but there are some senile folk still around that knew how to play 14 years ago. 
---
For sure. Once 20 mans are out they are all 3-day reset sign-ups you're free to do as well.
---
I always love questie. Some quests dont always line up with the server youre on but it gives you most quests and where you need to go to complete them.
---
I recommend if you want to go hardcore you farm enough gold to swap specs. If you must go a single spec, go fury. Fury is very viable in pvp and optimal in pve. Arms is optimal in pvp and only for casual pve.
---
Another way to approach it is to raid fury until you get a huge two hander with some gear and then pvp the rest of the way as arms. Eventually, your gear may get outdated though.
---
Get soulseeker... the dream son!
---
&gt;If this release gets postponed, Blizzard will lose to private servers.
---
No.
---
Very knowledgeable and experienced Guildmaster, a lot of thought behind the guild structure and a lot of motivation make it that this will be one of the highest quality guilds in NA - I have no doubt about that. Good luck Jax!
---
&gt; I've levelled Prot before. It's slower killing than arms but you lose less health per mob and have less downtime.
---
I'm finding it hard to believe that prot warrior has less downtime compared to a 2H jousting warrior. 
---
This is true.  It was exceptionally annoying on launch because of the lag and neutral creatures running out of range of auto attack and they would keep running while you character runner banded.
---
The reason it often isn't noticed is because you mostly would get into agro range of a hostile mob anyway (the annoying stutter attack problem where you would be out of range the entire charge stun which was really bad trying to engage tough elites).  Also the pvp sticky combat.
---
Where I'm questing. I like to go do other things while on Flight Paths, and so it doesn't count as real downtime. But when I want to turn in quests right away, or go from one questing session to the next chain of them, having the hearth take me to the hub beats walking by a mile.
---
My point? I m not trying to make a point. It's my opinion.
---
The answer is always horde
---
I don't think I've ever had it elsewhere than Astanaar on classic. Gotta catch those boats. 
---
Catfood
---
People who play on pservers will be significantly at an advantage.
---
But most people won't, and shouldn't, play for the top. Take your time and enjoy.
---
Stormwind is boring and too much a reflection of regular human architecture I can literally see anywhere in the world I live in. The fantasy aspect of it just kinda goes over my head.
---
Ironforge really isn't much different. Take away the mountain and just a metal city.
---
Easiest way to put it 👍🏼
---
Not to mention if you ever play night elf you are just disconnected from the entire world and your allied races.
---
I played a NE rogue for like a month back in regular vanilla and it was just.....purple....and isolated from everyone (compared to orc, troll, tauren all next to each other.
---
At least the forsaken are one zepplin away. I never had a issue jumping as an undead to a horde zone to switch it up
---
what are the name of these gloves? The one i talk about is 4/4 too
---
I think reading guides will be too tempting for a lot of people. Maybe not at first, but once you're 60, it's much easier to google what spec you should run and which piece of gear you should aim to get than trying to come up with something yourself and relying on luck to get upgrades.
---
Not to mention that you wouldn't even know which stats to aim for unless you run the maths yourself, and at this point you're just redoing the work that someone else did and compiled into guides that you can readily find online. 
---
Even if by some miracle you manage to find 39 people who want to go blind into everything, I think after a few nights of hard wiping, a lot of people would be inclined to go look online for the solution to their problems. 
---
I wish you the best, though, it sounds like a wonderful idea. 
---
But..but... trust Activision Blizzard to get it right, guys.
---
btw the shoulders u had is 2 armor worse then these, but thanks for the heads up, didn't even think about the enchant on gray :D
---
(U cant enchant the green ones i guess right, because 3 sta is better then 32 armor for sure) :p
---
Thanks man!
---
Or at least when they shit on retail they can be somewhat informed about what makes it shit. Not just guessing from what was wrong with previous expansions. 
---
Priest is the most fun imo. You got heals for everything. Flash heals, big heals, aoe heals, HoT, shield. 
---
13 character limit
---
Make sure you pick up &lt;Searching For The Lost Sachel&gt; and &lt;Testing The Enemy’s Strength&gt; from Thunder Bluff before heading to the barrens, every org and troll will love you for sharing them?
---
Why bring more druids when their HoTs don't stack? 
---
THICC
---
Make it through the necessary but unwelcome initial sharding period.
---
The automatic group finder isn't even used for high level dungeons any more. And only people who never raid use LFR. Those tools are really not the issue any more (only thing it does is divide the playerbase into super-casuals and not-so-casuals). Cross realm shit definitely is an issue though. But honestly, if they just removed all cross realm stuff the whole "server community" thing would really not be much different from vanilla. Nowadays all community stuff is relegated to guilds, which sucks hard if you're not in a guild, but is still kind of sad even if you are in one. 
---
One for Rogue - tells you how actually get the gear as well.

There are negative things about both experiences that some look at as a positive. When asked by a friend what is the reason to sub to WoW saying "All the things you can collect and earn whilst playing" might actually be a turn on. For me personally im not one to care about lore or story as much as I am the core gameplay and competitive aspects so there's not really that much for me; but for my friends who are still playing even though the lore is taking a weird turn and they judge it hard, at the end of the day they're always excited to see where it goes next. Here's hoping they find a way to suit everybody's needs and make the largest group of angry gamers proud to play WoW again. 
---
Cool, good to know. I thought it had a higher priority on par with ignite. So fury warriors must all have deep wounds for impale, right? 
---
Ah, wish you were horde! Me and a buddy don’t have a home yet. It’s early, but we’re already looking for something. 
---
Trash and recycling...
---
Smash My Trash? Know a guy named Ryan Haskins? haha. I'd lose it if you said yes.  
---
It will be nice to get a real release date and I'm sure lots more guilds will be posting :)
---
6 days straight...Does that mean no sleep? Because with sleep 6 days straight is easily doable :)
---
The only other games I've been this hyped about are The Burning Crusade expansion, and Grand Theft Auto Vice City.  
---
There is this strange feeling in your stomach when you think about it getting closer every day. I honestly just can't wait to play.  
---
I might get on a pserver and run Deadmines for the hell of it.  
---
&gt;Better than discussing sharding for the 9,300th time?
---
Absolutely
---
Finding a guild, sticking to it and making friends :)
---
My warrior took like 18 days to hit 60, I didn’t use any addons 
---
haha fair
---
&gt;Dailies/WQ are not fun. It’s literally seen as a chore by 99% of the community. 
---
Luckily it's a chore you can mostly ignore. Depending on what your goals are. 
---
&gt;In classic you still need/needed gold to raid but you could choose how you wanted to do it.
---
You still need a lot of gold to raid. Consumables are really expensive in retail. You can also choose how to do it still. I think straight up grinding in a group is the best way, but it's boring as fuck. Gathering professions are decent, and not as boring as straight up grinding. Playing the AH is the most time efficient, but requires a lot of knowledge/experience to pull it off, and requires some starting capital. 
---
&gt;Also, crafting was a lot different in classic. 
---
Yep, it's more about improving your own character now. Although you can still make decent money from it, but due to the nature of some resources (expulsum for example) you tend to sacrifice benefits for your own character by selling stuff instead. 
---
&gt;Alts being more prevalent and professions being easier to level made every market saturated. 
---
Yep. Buying mats and crafting potions for example will not really get you any extra money. And there are no rare recipes any more which is kind of boring. 
---
&gt;Garrisons was the final knife in the back. 
---
Which haven't been a thing for two expansions now, so I don't see how that is relevant. 
---
Hey man, make that money now so you can take more days off later. 
---
Both.

&gt;Extended prolongation of timegated superficial content  
---
Imagine typing this unironically 
---
post proof. 
---
I hope you keep posting this stuff after release.  
---
&gt;RNG
---
Like the small chance of getting your drop in a raid in vanilla. 
---
&gt;no raid tier sets
---
Azerite gear instead.
---
&gt;timegating
---
Not sure what this is referring too. You mean like releasing patches and content a few months into the expansion? How is that different from AQ or something in vanilla. 
---
&gt;stupid azerite grind
---
Yeah, because vanilla isn't grindy at all... 
---
&gt;doing one stupid raid for 5 months on 3 different difficulties
---
Doing one stupid raid for 5 months on 1 difficulty in vanilla. What's the difference?
---
&gt;sharding
---
Yep, that's shit. 
---
&gt;no social between ppl
---
Not usually between random people in the world. But there is plenty of social stuff going on in pugs or guilds. I mostly agree with you though. 
---
&gt;LFR/LFD
---
Not used except by super-casuals, who would not be playing vanilla anyway. 
---
&gt;simplified talents
---
Yeah, vanilla has 40 out of 50 useless talents instead. 
---
&gt;less spells
---
More useful spells. 
---
&gt;removing spells only to add them in next xpac
---
Vanilla completely changed a lot of spells over the patches, same shit. 
---
I also like vanilla more. But you guys are talking so much shit. Or at least have a complete lack of empathy. Can you really not see how some people might like a lot of the features in retail? 
---
I wish there was a quantifiable way to determine whether or not it's better for me to stay up the first 48 hours, or sleep on a regular schedule.  
---
bro coke already has caffeine in it
---
That is a really trivial fix though. Just delete copied gold and bind all copied items (even if they could not normally become soul bound). 
---
Forever vanilla and forever TBC existing in parallel with no crossover from vanilla to TBC is a problem, in that it means you're going to *have* to relevel every expansion. Is it simple? Yeah, but it is just forcing players to repeat content they've already done, except this time some portion of it is no longer as originally intended (due to higher level cap).
---
Yeah but everyone forgets about the anti-perk. A million mages, and only 2 pieces of gear drop per boss in 40-man raids.
---
Mythic raiding is harder than ever - they made being able to access and attempt hard content easier than ever before but made the content itself significantly more difficult. Far more 'one person fucks up and wipes the raid' type of stuff today than in the past.
---
Rhok and Lok baby.
---
Orc master-race, stun resist for life.
---
Nice to see actual Blizzard employees acknowledge that the challenge of the open world is a good thing.  
---
Question. Or use Joanna's leveling guide 
---
Warrior abilities are more stance restricted than weapon restricted 
---
They're really strong. Shadow especially for pvp, but imo quite boring.
---
Try the other side. I like both Horde and Alliance. The only thing though is that if you want fast pvp queue times you should roll horde. It is EXTREMELY likely that history will repeat itself in terms of population being larger on Alliance side due to the horde having no "pretty" races, aka blood elves.

/r/wow is a total circlejerk too. It's full of people complaining about the new mounts being boring and stuff like that. 
---
I don't think there is anyone who is entirely satisfied by BfA, but if you're a somewhat hardcore raider for example it's not too bad. You have probably stopped playing by now (before the next patch), but that happens every expansion/patch when you get bored of the current raid, nothing out of the ordinary. 
---
Sure stuff like azerite gear and certain class things is kind of shit, but it's not the end of the world, and definitely not something that is impossible for Blizzard to fix or improve on in the future. BfA is not a WoW-ending expansion for those people, it's just a shitty expansion, hopefully it will become better in the future. 
---
Most classes play fine, definitely better than in vanilla, but worse than some previous expansions. And the raid is fine too, definitely better than vanilla, but worse than some previous raids. The new raid is said to be really good though, and Blizzard are slowly improving on at least some things. I think most people are just hoping the next expansion will be better, while maybe progressing through the raids and stuff here, but not much more. 
---
If you get fishing boots + hat. You will dominate everyone who hasn't. Class won't matter. Lvl 19 ofc. All other brackets suck 
---
I mostly just play for the raids. Sure, there are some "chores" that I do to prepare for raiding, but it's not worse than vanilla end game. 
---
To get my UBRS key, it took me 37 Wyrmthalek kills to finally get the last gem. The best tank that I had the whole time was a shammy. 
---
“Why do you want to play a game that you can’t win?”
---
Yeeeassssss!!! My buddy will for sure be down. We both have experience with all the vanilla end game and also LOVE pvp. Let’s roll horde! 
---
Shadow is strong in nilla. I’m rolling a rogue and I’m so excited! Just like old times! 
---
Gearscore and Rawr killed WoW. 
---
I don't remember backstab ever being able to hit from anywhere else but from the back in vanilla, I highly doubt it'll be possible in Classic. 
---
Dudes playing as female characters? Always gonna be strange to me.
---
You could only do it if there was some medium Ms on your part and the strafing took a bit more time to register on server allowing you (sometimes) to use backstab from the front.
---
I may be misremembering and i only experienced it in pservers.
---
I'm approx 99.9% sure this is a private server bug.
---
Ok, thanks for replying. I was planning out my life after classic.
---
I think it’s important to note that hardcore vanilla doesn’t necessarily mean as much nolife as people might think. 
---
I had friends during 2005-2007 who dropped out of school to play World of Warcraft and I still achieved way more when it came to PvE raiding, including progressing quite far through Naxxramas. 
---
I feel that if you only have a single character and you can find a way to grind your flasks and consumables, you will be able to progress far in PvE with a few raid nights a week. No need to commit your life to it. 
---
2 armor is nothing though, I’ll definetly go with scouting over feral because they just look cooler imo (a little vain I guess). Scouting Trousers of the Monkey might be a good alternative to the Leggings of the Fang too. 
---
Yes, the idea is you mail the white quality shoulders to a lvl 60 alt/friend and have them apply the enchant (don’t think zg/naxx ench can be applied through the trade window), making it not possible with a BoP quest reward. Would be nice to do with the boe goggles and pants too but I think they would become soulbound.
---
Joana speed runs on private servers still today on twitch from time to time. His old record has been shattered by himself countless times. Its very likely under 3 days played at this point.
---
these kind of posts should have a flair
---
Was wondering if anyone knew of english speaking guilds that will be playing Horde in China? Will be in Shanghai and am worried i'll be riding solo :( 
---
Link?
---
Not on launch, but I predict the 1-60 wr on classic solo will eventually be optimized to just under 3 days played. Joana himself speedruns private servers from time to time and has definitely already beaten his record. 
---
Get to a point in classic's history with no competition for low spawn, key early game mobs and enough optimization on a patch you know will never change, and you have a platform for speedrunners to move in on and continue to improve and optimize over time.
---
WoD was pretty light on content, however i don't think the, out of my head, 2 store mounts introduced during WoD had anything to do with that. On the other hand, while light on content generally, WoD had some really good dungeons and also the raids were generally very good. 
---
&gt;- moreover wand would spend full time GCD before shooting, which is terrible, it sure is.
---
Does this mean that the actual wand attack time starts when GCD is done? which would mean that effective attack speed is much lower?
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ubyr6/wow_classic_demo_feedback_bugs_and_legion/
---
I wouldn't take the state of the demo to be representative of classic. Energy gain for example was comically off.
---
There are a lot of things wrong with private servers, either by accident like this case or intentionally like realm sizes for example. 
---
God damn. The amount of salt in those wowhead comments. People are so angry over classic even though it doesn't affect them in any way lol.
---
IT'S A TRAP!
---
The only challenge was to kill humanoid before they run into another group. It is a lot easier to level up in 1.12 than it was in 1.0. 
---
Anyway, it is a different kind of leveling than retail, you can still do it spamming two buttons and watching Netflix at the same time. Can't really call that challenging on the mind. 
---
I'll break your arm if you say "who's the tank"! What's the name of the warlock?
---
Roleplaying a Tauren is always interesting. Druidism is the defacto religion (but that certainly doesn't mean your character can subscribe to any religion they want) of Thunder Bluff, but then you have to consider what kind of Tauren you are. Are you a Grimtotem shaman who sees her clan do dishonorable things to her new Horde allies and aims to protect them from their wrath? Are you a Bloodhoof Brave who wanders Azeroth when off duty of protecting Red Cloud Mesa? Are you part of another tribe in Thunder Bluff seeking to earn your keep upon the bluffs?
---
One of my favorite parts of RP is using the Racial voices (sorry Orcs and Humans!) to converse with members of my race when away from home to ask what their experiences have been with certain citizens or areas.
---
TLDR: Still work to do regarding dungeons, auctionen houses and guilds. But summer 2019.
---
All feedback from the demo has been useful in tuning the game.
---
People want classic WoW as it was in difficulty and it will remaint hat.
---
won't have any trouble finding a raid spot as a healer. 
---
This is just too far lol, makes no sense at all.
---
This needs to not be a thing in this sub.
---
I mean really? Don't you remember that shitstorm from retail players when Classic was announced? Literally every thread about Classic on r/wow was getting downvoted into oblivion, there was so much hate about Classic on forums too.
---
So I really don't know who's insecure here
---
BfA is the worst expansion ever. The only reason I'm still subbed is that I can't find any other MMO to play until Classic comes out.
---
What are you talking about? The Classic announcement is literally the most upvoted post of all time on /r/wow.
---
absolutely right. sadly.
---
I'm sorry but I disagree, it's really that bad especially compared to Legion or even WoD (because WoD actually had a good class design). I'm still subbed until Classic comes out because I can't find any other MMO to play, but BfA is really the worst expansion I've ever played.
---
However if you enjoy it that's fine, what I wrote is just my opinion.
---
The only things you can queue on retail are the casual content.
---
Because you assign Druids so that they don't overlap?
---
&gt;Most classes play fine, definitely better than in vanilla
---
&gt;And the raid is fine too, definitely better than vanilla
---
That's just like, your opinion, man.
---
Classes in vanilla were maybe sometimes boring, but at least they felt unique. BfA classes are fucking dull and boring. Legion class design looks like a masterpiece compared to that.
---
Without knowing your own personal health and how you personally handle varying levels of sleep deprivation, it's a total non-starter to even try to have a good guess at its viability.
---
You're certainly not alone! I have it on alllll the time :) 
---
I'd rather have a warrior with a 2hander in my raid then a dishonest dumbass.
---
Raid guilds are not there to personally accommodate you.
---
If they let one guy use a meme spec or highly unoptimised one it doesn’t take long until more and more are asking to do the same.
---
I mean it's a prebeta demo based on retail, anyone who expects it to be a finished product should probably learn what the phrase work in progress means. Unless it's something that they have specifically said will be different from vanilla I'm not expecting it to be. Exception being things that are obvious based on common sense (battlenet launcher and interface in game because if they didn't have the interface but the launcher it would add unnecessary steps to use it without actually getting rid of it and battlenet and its launcher are how they distribute games now).
---
The point is that most if not all "chores" are fully optional. You don't need to do islands if you don't like them, you don't need to do WQ's if you don't like them. Generally you can just do the content you do like and don't bother with the rest. 
---
Who are you to tell other people how they are allowed to enjoy the game?
---
What am I talking about? Are you serious? Have you tried sorting by new when Classic was announced? So many retail players literally insulting people for being hyped and I was also talking about forums, which you missed I guess. It was even worse there.
---
Few weeks after the Classic announcement you couldn't say there on r/wow you're hyped about it.
---
Go back to r/wow, from your profile it looks like you're defending retail way too hard basically everywhere you can. I don't know why you're doing it on this sub tho.
---
It's slow and tedious, which can be very challenging for your mind to sit through. Where retail is more like watching a Michael Bay action movie Classic is more like an old hungarian silent film in black and white. 
---
You can always make an alt on the other faction, but deep down it won't feel right to main the other one when you already know ehich faction you love more.
---
Played vanilla gw2. Havent touched the fame in four years. Can see that legendaries tripled in price and precursur weapons  finlaly got theor own models. What i miss?
---
There is no such thing as a loot system that has no room for drama. People can always get angry no matter the system. Also you can easily game this system.
---
That's what I was going for! Glad it worked :D
---
Wow thank you so much Zeromone! I'll certainly be making more and comments like these are the best motivation to do so. You're very welcome to come and visit my discord if you'd like to chat about any of your favourite tracks - would love to hear from you! [https://discord.gg/Cz9gZcU](https://discord.gg/Cz9gZcU)
---
I'd love to be able to raid BWL (and potentially even further beyond) this time around. I never even got full T1 back then, but I want to shoot for full T2 this time. I wish I could put Naxx as a realistic goal, but I doubt I'll have both the drive and time to commit to something like that. 
---
&gt; That's just like, your opinion, man.
---
That's the whole point. It's opinion. People in here are acting as if its a fact that vanilla is a better game, in essence saying that anyone who likes things about retail is just *wrong*, which definitely isn't the case. 
---
From my experience, Alliance is easier, especially for casuals.
---
What the actual fuck? Reported.
---
The one you enjoy playing as. That said...
---
For the Alliance! 
---
I don't quite understand those who claim that people will quickly realise that it's nothing to explore in the game anymore - it's only because it was so big and new back then.   
---
Do they not realise people played alts? Many of them? Through three expansions where the old world didn't actually change too much?
---
I'm not planning to go back because I think I'll experience the "oh so shiny and big world" feeling. I'm going back because I think the gameplay and social parts of Classic is better than Retail, and nobody can tell me to feel differently.
---
[OP after reading the comments](https://pics.me.me/ive-made-a-huge-mistake-14775943.png)
---
It´s bad compared to Legion, but WoD is still worse. It doesn´t matter that your game has good class design when it doesn´t have any content. And unlike with BfA, where we still have at least 2 major patches to go (with 8.2 completely reworking Heart of Azeroth and Azerite armor), we know for a fact WoD did not have said content.
---
I will take worse class design over lack of content any time.
---
You have several months. Practice some different strategies and conduct tests on yourself to monitor cognitive function at various points over the 48 hour period. You may find that you are able to "get ahead of the pack" in a 48 hour period broken up with short rest periods before a solid 8 hour sleep then continue on a more sustainable sleep pattern for another week or so to 60. Or 2 months if you're playing a warrior.
---
Regardless, you should definitely try it out before launch to get yourself used to it and be familiar with how it'll feel.
---
I think you're mistaking "I wish" with "Oh my god please math me baby"
---
bto I just dont have money for Blizard and legal server ,,,,,,
---
Looking purely at stat/buff/spell advantage and not numbers that could be incorrect on prv servers, i'd say Alliance.
---
I will go to whatever subreddit I wanna go to, thank you. :) Thanks for checking my profile, it means a lot to me that you care about me so much!
---
And no, I don't remember the downvotes you mention, in fact, every time I come across a comment bashing classic on /r/wow it's always downvoted to hell, while here it's the exact opposite. And even if what you're saying was true, that doesn't really give you a reason to bash retail. It's basically "you insulted my game, I'll insult yours!" Not very mature.
---
And FYI, I'm in this sub because I like Classic, I have a lot of great memories of it, but I also like retail for different reasons, and it's kinda tiring that everytime I come into this sub all I see is just mostly ignorant hating on it.
---
Bless &lt;3
---
Unless you are min / maxing to some degree both are completely viable. What ever one you want. 
---
Alliance is just massively better for PvE content throughout all of Vanilla. It isn't just Salv, it is that you only need 4 Paladins for the entire raid to get the full benefit of having Paladins. Windfury is an amazing mechanic for Fury Warriors because of the way Rage works, but they end up threat capped constantly. I guess this is the meta on pservers now to, but in actual vanilla as Horde we switched to a Fury Warrior "tanking" farm content with Dual Wield just for higher TPS. 
---
Chain Heal is pretty amazing in AQ40 and Naxx, I'd argue a Naxx geared Shaman is the single best healer in Vanilla, but it doesn't compare to the raid wide benefit Paladins bring. 
---
And again, it's a double edged sword. I'm not saying you're wrong, but this discussion could go forever. Yes, there are people here who hate retail. But there are also people on r/wow and on forums who hate Classic so much and they can't stand the fact people are hyped for it. Just few minutes ago I responded to some guy in this thread who was defending BfA and retail, well I checked his profile and all he's doing on this sub is defending retail and attacking people who said something bad about it, on r/classicwow. 
---
Thanks for the input, but you couldnt have offered a less helpful answer. Please dont circumvent the question if you decide to respond :)
---
I see. So are you saying that the damage boost on the horde is less important than the threat reduction from BoS?
---
Winter 2017™
---
This design philosophy works when the game is new, but WoW is 14 years old. Most of your time is spent on max level and that´s a fact. So for WoW to even survive, main focus needs to be on the max level content.
---
That doesn´t mean levelling should be bad, but you can´t bring design philosophy of a game that lasted for 2 years to a game that lasted for 14 years and is still going.
---
To see as much of the raiding content as possible.
---
Shoot me a pm sir 
---
I think those who will be going in for the first time or people who haven´t played in many years will do a lot of exploration simply because it´s their first time or they forgot a lot (I am in this category).
---
But people in here who probably played a lot on private servers won´t be going in and explore the world. I mean, there are so many posts here where people debate what class should they play, what professions should they level because they are the most viable, how to manage their gold and so on. That doesn´t sound like "You create character and go explore and help your faction".
---
It all depends on how much interest I can get.  I will keep promoting the idea and hopefully I can get a decent pool of people before launch to give us a head start on forming a monster guild :)
---
1.13 is a new patch. Basically, 1.1 - 1.12 is Vanilla, 1.13 is Classic.
---
i would say depends on the class u want to play, any healer or ranged dps - go alliance blessings r just awesome. If u want to play melee dps go horde. tank doesnt matter, maybe in alliance is easier becouse of fear ward and blessings, but u lose fun with windfury numbers when u r respecing to dps.
---
Yeah man, warlock wanst fun at all for me in bfa, PvP and pve. Depending on a freaking 3 minutes cooldown or stacking some buff to 100 to do damage is just awful design.
---
Wasn’t in vanilla. It’s definitely a pserver bug. There is no evidence anywhere of this being a thing in vanilla.
---
If you are talking pure character.  Then the horde racials in vanilla were very OP.  Most top raid guilds back then ran horde.  But really you should just choose what you would like to play.  Shite looking at a character you dont like every day just to raid.  
---
Should be a classic recruitment sub instead else this will get spammed more and more leading up to and through release. 
---
You should definitely roll horde then. 
---
I'm really going to hope the majority of this post was mostly written with a /s.
---
&gt;but WoD is still worse.
---
WoD also had fun raids, PvP vendors (the reason what kept me playing even with the lack of content) and fun dungeons. It's just that they moved their resources on the next expansion and gave up on WoD, that's the reason why there's so much of removed content from that expansion. 
---
How do you know they won't do the same with BfA? It's obviously at all time low in sub count, my realm feels completely dead for example as well as my guild that was really active in Legion.
---
&gt;with 8.2 completely reworking Heart of Azeroth and Azerite armor
---
I know about this, but I won't believe until I see it. It's always "wait for the next patch, wait for the next expansion they will fix it" and I'm getting tired of it. 
---
&gt;I will take worse class design over lack of content any time.
---
Well that's you, but I won't. If classes aren't fun to play that usually for me means the whole game is boring to play. I saw an awesome video on Youtube exactly about this. 
---
You know I wonder about this for PvP queue times.  I remember it the same way as you where Horde had instant queues and Alliance had terrible queue times.  Almost everyone I have heard from this sub/other locations say that it was pretty balanced with and if anyone had queues Horde did because of better PvP racials.  Starting to doubt my memory... but my pvp guild did reroll horde on another server to get away from terrible queues ...
---
can a holy paladin wishlist ashbringer? 
---
Would love to see you level with two buttons in Vanilla past 20.
---
To down bosses you should go whichever faction is a majority on your sever; the greater the majority the greater chance for better guildmates. It'd be splitting hairs to say which faction was better at downing bosses but if I were to guess I'd say Alliance. Blessings combined with the Seal of Wisdom debuff offer a major dps increase while the Horde had to choose between Tranquil Air Totem and Windfury Totem in order to increase dps. It could change based on the boss but overall I'd say Alliance is slightly better in raids. 
---
Damn that's pretty rough, feels like priest leveling does take a serious hit going from private to classic
---
As some others have touched upon, threat reduction makes for smoother raids than damage boosts. Once your raid is geared, then the top dps classes will be having to stall their damage somewhat because of threat anyway, at least until the MT has a solid tps set. Salv and kings are just generally awesome anyway.
---
On the other hand, horde do have a better time gearing their melee dps, because their fury warriors usually want axes, whereas alliance furys want swords or maces, which means they compete with rogues.
---
Honestly though, it's a close call and there will be good raiding guilds in both factions that can clear content, so you're better of picking the faction you enjoy more.
---
NEET guild!
---
Reckon it will be pushed back to Winter or 2020. Seeing as they can't even do a basic Q&amp;A for us yet I'm not hopeful of a summer release.
---
There's so many unknown variables! How many hours of sleep you need, how much population will impact your leveling speed (which is the primary reason for going ham and getting ahead of the pack, and will be affected by your server choice as well as hpw fast you can level), how much inefficiency in your leveling will be caused by sleep deprivation, and likely a few other things I'm forgetting to account for. I don't mind doing some math, but that's not an excuse to bullshit you :p
---
That's a cool idea.
---
NA im not
---
That's where the entire game was wrong. Was such a steep vertical development necessary? Did we have to progress 10 levels each expansion? Did we need to powercreep from 8k HP to 40k HP within one expansion? Couldn't the game have been handled more horizontally than vertically? The obsoletification of previous content with the release of a new expansion was the big reason for its downfall in the long run. 
---
Do a full BRD run.
---
I do not, but I did a FB search and if he went to OU, we have 2 mutual friends. Lol
---
I think pally bubble is pretty OP, but in the grand scheme of things its not too important. 
---
I'm going crazy over the lack of Classic news, but I'm not too worried about it getting pushed back (yet). My belief for doing so is that they don't want to overshadow BFA's announcements, with the new raid coming out next week and 8.1.5 likely coming out next month.
---
If we don't start getting more information and Q&amp;As during March, that's when I'd start to worry.
---
I honestly think the rams are the sickest mounts in the alliance, i always go for them with my humans
---
Went through both in vanilla and Alliance is definitely easier for PvE.
---
It boils down to blessing are better than totems for PvE as well as a few other subtle things.
---
I did find the fights more enjoyable as horde though
---
they can't possibly create a personal loot system in classic. it requires the streamlined spec/items retail has. What loot would you give a hotw healer druid for example?
---
No Personal Loot and It's still a hard maybe on Loot Trading, there are arguments for both sides.
---
Thanks
---
Well hunters warlocks aoe mages and druids are faster which makes priests middle of the pack
---
Pallies are just less work for more in vanilla. With 3 pallies you have a whole 40man raid covered with amazing buffs. Kings, wisdom and salv are just amazing. You also get fear ward and hu wep skill on melee. Horse advantages are wf totem, tremor totem and chain heal. Overall though alliance is the clear winner.
---
Dont worry it is complete aids. Sure in full Naxx gear you'll be better of as something else but for most of the game (at 60 too) BM is good in PvP 
---
If you’re interested in their guild, you go to the website he linked and there’s probably a spot to submit an application. Although given your lack of effort I’m guessing you aren’t the type of person they want lol 
---
&gt; Nothing is worse than a retail shill.
---
a Diablo Immortal shill.
---
Ashkandi
---
I believe it will be a combination of personal loot and the well-received Titan Forging system.
---
&gt; If I remember right, I'm pretty sure fury warriors actually stacked as much armor pen as they could get in WotLK.
---
There were two types of warriors.
---
ARP warriors. (Often DPS in raids.)
---
Or STR warriors (Often tanks in raids - usually early on when all the physical DPSers still needed the ARP stuff)
---
You’re now a moderator of r/wallstreetbets 
---
&gt;- You suck in group PvP and huge teamfights (e.g. raiding Orgrimmar)
---
Rogues and especially rogues in a group with maybe a druid or two in the mix are great for assassinating people in Orgrimmar and melting into the shadows when you get outnumbered too badly only to reappear seconds later with your daggers in their backs. 
---
&gt; Just roll somewhere where they aren't
---
That's impossible. Theres going to be private server guilds all over. And you won't really know them from the others because they will recruit non private server players too.
---
Exactly, this is petty as hell. How does someone else being a better more informed player than you "ruin your experience".
---
I guess that has more to do with your tanks skill than the faction really. WF is a big fun factor as a melee player in my opinion, but if your tanks are slacking you might have to stop attacking and that's just not fun at all. Your rotation becomes a rollercoaster. 
---
As alliance with BoS your DPS rotation is much smoother and the TPS pressure is almost a non issue, plus human racial is overall stronger than orc when it comes to PvE because end-game swords are better than axes.
---
Melee classes aside, Blessings overall provide more to the whole raid than totems and everybody agrees that Alliance has an easier time. Now to put that in perspective, we're talking 14-15 years old raids with barely any mechanics and encounters shorter than a minute in pre-raid gear, so in the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter because it's hardly any challenge for today's standards if we're honest.
---
The world record on authentic classic servers is 4d20h - so if you are world class, you can do it in five days.
---
Seven days is an ambitious goal, even for people who have done it before. 
---
Alliance are just straight up better for PvE. Paladins are better than shamans, humans are the best melee, gnomes are the best casters and dwarves and humans are the best priests. Ironforge is in really good position too.
---
The only thing horde got is that taurens are slightly better tanks than night elves, easier access to AQ and Viscidus is a lot easier with shamans
---
Not fast enough for my liking &gt;:|
---
Ive actually heard that nelfs are the worst tanks i  the game because a dodged hit gives no rage.
---
With HotS going down the drain with rumours of HS being next. Then factoring in Diablo immortal on top of Bungie getting out of ActiBlizz before their contract ended things are not looking positive for that company. It would be nice to get some good news from ActiBlizz for a change.
---
It was a bug that happened due to horrible pathing on private. It only sometimes happened on retail due to lag.  A bigger question is will a riposte/SS macro work. I honestly can't remember if it worked in Vanilla. I remember things like hamstring and charge working on the same button, but no idea about riposte. A riposte macro works on private but could be a bug. 
---
Just like my actual guild, they can't have common-sense to admit people can love "a downgraded version of wow".  
---
I just hope people like us will be a ton, just to see their face after that.
---
What can men do against such reckless hate?
---
"~~probably~~ hopefully means they need it anyway"
---
FTFY
---
That might probably be true actually but the nature res could still make them the best alliance tanks.
---
Is this some bait from Blizzard employees trying to see how many idiots want personal loot? What a stupid question.
---
I am 99% sure personal loot won't be in Classic.
---
it surely does. i'd say about 5-10% nerf
---
The Bfa announcements that get mostly negative down votes on YouTube and that no one cares for? 
---
It's never lupus.... Wait wrong sub. 
---
Why do people think there will be new players tho? most people who will play classic have already played vanilla so the exploration factor wont be there for them. Also there wont be many people who havent played any wow, because if someone had the urge to try wow, have already tried it in the last 10+ years.
---
I think its just funny how oldheads are so prepared to relive their experiences but will realise that it will get boring for them pretty fast. And the fact that they think that raiding wont be for elitist pricks who thinks gear&gt;skill, is also funny. People know the mechanics now for every boss, so its gonna be like it is in retail: if you are not playing hours everyday and doesnt have good gear, you wont get into raids.
---
I saw this guide earlier. Questionable quality. Doesn’t even list Fishing boots.
---
Female Dwarf Rogue -  Pawgchamp 
---
Druid - Katmandru.
---
Troll Mage - Zulthuzad
---
Tauren Elemental Shaman - MooklaTesla 
---
Shadow Priest - Thesenate, Ironic, prequelmeme, Palpatine
---
So that's a maybe?
---
Booty Bay until 40 then Gadgezan
---
&gt; The videos that I posted are all pre-2.0.1 though. So there would have had to have been a change sometime between them and 2.1.0 where Charge did not put you into combat that was not in the patch notes.
---
Or perhaps the bug did not affect PvP?
---
&gt;Edit- And just looking at that patch note, it seems like pre-2.1 the person being charged was the one who was not put into combat
---
I'm not sure where you're getting that. Is there more extensive wording in the full patch notes?
---
If personal loot is in classic its DOA
---
Recruitment should be posted here: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/afu75o/looking_for_group_monday_january_14_2019/
---
Yeah weekly stickies may not be enough, especially close to launch.
---
And this time it is not even hyperbole.
---
The edit was not needed mate people do agree with you. Sit back and relax.
---
I'm relaxed just tired of this sub down-voting any form of negative opinion. Normally I roll my eyes at people who do the whole "edit: why downvotes?" thing, guess this sub has turned me into what I dislike :/
---
The guy who did that world record didn't even auto loot. He says himself he thinks he'll do sub 4days no worries. Things got discovered since then. Playing 12h a day an experimented player that isn't sprinting will be done in 10 to 12 days depending on the class. 
---
Yes they do and no they can't. Though a lot more of their dps comes from abilities than other classes so it's not as bad
---
There is an argument to make for Nightelves being the better choice when building for a tank warrior.
---
This is because Nightelves get a 1% extra dodge and the 10 points bonus in nature resistance, which is very useful in ZG, AQ and Naxx.
---
Now obviously, the extra hit rate on weapon skill is important even for tanks, but since you are rage-capped all the time when tanking, daggers are superior in terms of threat-per-second, as it allows you to spam heroic strike faster, which accounts for a huge chunk of your threat generation. And daggers are not affected by the human racial.
---
For DPS, I would definitely not want to miss the human racial. It's just way too good to give up. But keep in mind that we're talking small percentages here. Your raid progress will not be different just because you deal 3% more damage. It's really a personal preference.
---
Personalised loot will not be a part of Classic.    
---
-
---
Blizzard's reasoning behind Loot Trading is to (attempt to) cut down on the number of GM tickets being set out.
---
Mostly in cases where your guild's master looter has fucked up and given a drop to the wrong person.
---
dumbest way to put it. you can talk about any sort of min maxing and then say if your raid cant do a raid without the 5% tauren racial then you have problems. or if you cant pvp without 25% stun racial then you have problems... you can keep going and say about any racial or item 
---
r/whoosh
---
&gt; Seeing as they can't even do a basic Q&amp;A for us yet I'm not hopeful of a summer release.
---
"Don't want to" isn't the same as "can't". Blizzard devs have never been particularly engaged with the community. Show, don't tell, and all that.
---
Questie is pretty dated.
---
If you level another alt before Classic comes out I **highly** recommend checking out [pfQuest](https://shagu.org/pfQuest/) instead.
---
It's MUCH more detailed and can fully replace Questie AND gatherer.
---
Very much do-able for most classes with macros. Paladin and Hunters being obvious culprits. Off the top you can pretty much just use sinister strike and s&amp;d as rogue, can spam raptor strike with a fat 2h as hunter with pet tanking. Mages I am pretty sure only need two buttons unless you count using drinks between mobs. Iirc warlocks can macro down to two buttons.  
---
Only two I can think of that might not be two button situations are warriors and druids. 
---
Whilst I love vanilla WoW for all the options the best options are usually just a few abilities. End-game rotations are pretty simple as well for most classes. For example hunter with the auto&gt;aimed&gt;auto&gt;multi&gt;auto rotation (may have fucked the exact order up it has been 12 years!). You obviously weave in other things like fd trinket swap but the base rotation is simple. 
---
pathetic how you guys fear losing a name :D
---
i think warlocks being able to chain fear and seduce and death coil is op
---
A start attack on the macro makes this pointless anyways. You could also add hamstring to the same macro. 
---
Now have him answer if you will be able to jump warrior charges and screw them like you could in Vanilla.
---
Also have him answer if focus won't be in since it wasn't in vanilla.
---
 It's going to be different. The idea that Classic is exact when built upon new server and client infrastructure is laughable. We are just hoping the servers can support large battles at this point That should have been a discussion they had. Who gives a #%\^# about having to make a macro? Warriors had lots of macros.
---
People that love retail will likely not enjoy classic and vice versa. So it's very likely they won't really care. I don't know why there is such an elitist mentality to this day about Classic. Both games have different aspects that different people enjoy.  
---
Classic has its weaknesses for sure, there is old aspects of game design that just seem counter-intuitive now. For example respawn rates in caves and aggro ranges are really quite bad by todays standards. It's not because it requires more thinking, it's because there were definite oversights in game design. 
---
If private servers are anything to go by, then even with guides most guilds will have a rough time with aq40 and to a lesser extent naxx, even if they have mc/bwl/ony on farm. 
---
You can expect people to smash those first raids quite easily though.
---
Righhtttttt, so no one remembers Ghostcrawler et al. all of a sudden. Oooooookay.
---
Most guilds don't have many paladins so if the stuff drops you'll get it surprisingly fast!
---
Ghostcrawler mostly talked about PvP balance in the existing live game at a time when Blizzard was pushing hard for WoW PvP to be an ~esport~. Completely apples to oranges.
---
&gt;This sub must be one of the worst circlejerks going. Any form of slightly negative opinion of the fact we have had no real news, baring in mind game launch is supposedly about 7 months away or so, and you get downvoted to oblivion.
---
That's pretty thick coming from someone consistently using downvotes as disagreement arrows.
---
Care to elaborate on the bows? Ive never heard about it.
---
I have no more time for you, you're the same waste of time who pretend to know about testing. Keep calling me thick though, whildt you get surface level knowledge on wikipedia between posts.  
---
Whilst you are it keep moving goalposts to meet your sycophantic obsession with ActiBlizz, are you actually Bobby Kotick? 
---
No more time for wastes of oxygen like yourself.
---
I can't see why Blizz would put personal loot in. 
---
While there are arguments for sharding and loot trading, there are none that I can think of for personal loot. Does it require more manpower that's deemed unnecessary to run normal loot mechanics instead of personal loot (which was their reasoning for loot trading instead of GMs handling loot accidents)? I don't think so. 
---
I should start doing my thesis during the summer &gt;\_&lt; oh well I'll have to create a schedule which allows some Classic action as well.
---
They don't have to make a new game. It's basically copy pasta to the new engine. And that is something Blizzard is very capable of. Think of Starcraft remastered. Easy Job compared to new games.
---
The entire leveling experience in vanilla isn't single mob encounters. There are many situations where you have to deal with multiple enemies and use actual utility - CC and heals are essential to surviving these encounters. Yes, killing a single npc in vanilla isn't difficult and shouldn't be but like I said, you WILL be in hairy situations quite a lot.
---
For an example, you would be unable to do escort quests.
---
finally getting thunderfury on my rogue, and later on propably even rank 14
---
True but starting with TBC they got weapon restricted on top of being stance restricted but vanilla only has the stance restriction which is at least makes things more interesting.
---
Well received - In a parallel universe yes.
---
Scholo and Strat UD are also run for pre-BiS or pre-BiS alternatives for some classes.
---
&gt; But there are also people on r/wow and on forums who hate Classic so much and they can't stand the fact people are hyped for it.
---
That doesn't justify what people on /r/classicwow are saying. 
---
Not new players, just players new to Classic. Someone who joined after Cata never did the original zones, so it will be completely new experience even if they know WoW well.
---
If you don´t make old content obsolete every once in a while, the game suffers for it. If they just kept adding new raids, we would end up with gear that is absolutely ridicculous in terms of power and said new raids would be done only by few players due to amount of commitment needed to gear for them.
---
And yes, you may like the idea of raid that was beaten just by few guilds in the entire world, but it´s contraproductive to put your resources to develop content that will be experienced by 0,1% of your playerbase.
---
Vanilla worked because it lasted just few years. Its model simply wasn´t sustainable in a long run.
---

It's like talking to flat Earth defenders or evolution denier's. They'll always find new "evidence" to say there view is better but all facts and data lead to the opposite
---
PvP vendors are not content, dungeons became useless pretty quickly and raids themselves cannot carry an entire expansion (especially when you are stuck with one raid for 14 months).
---
And about HoA rework. Well, don´t believe it, but it´s happening. I guess you also don´t believe we are going to Nazjatar in 8.2, because you haven´t seen it yet.
---
come on man you cant be serious.. just because a few zones are somewhat different, it wont be as ecxiting as it was for the first time, its stil the same game with little changes. same thing goes for the gameplay
---
This is awesome! It's precisely this kind of stuff I hope to see more of on this subreddit. Thank you sir!
---
Its impossible to use personal loot in vanilla.
---
Same here! Makes the world more immersive 
---
For some people, their character names tie into their sense of character identity.
---
Some names will also always sell for a significant amount of gold. And some of us like essentially free gold.
---
I genuinely don't understand people who don't like the game music... 
---
Have you actually played Cata? Entire areas like Westfall, Redridge, Silverpine, Hillsbrad, WPL, EPL, Felwood, Azshara, Barrens, Stonetalon, Thousand Needles, Desolace, Darkshore have been completely reworked, to the point where rarely any quest from the original area remains.
---
And you can´t be serious about the gameplay. The classes are completely different, some specs are entirely different from what their class was in Vanilla (Survival, Affliction, Demonology, entire mage being split into specs and that´s just classes I played).
---
I really, really liked this video.
---
Wonderful! There are a few more in the series and more coming as soon as I can make them :) 
---
I’ve noticed in leveling my first mage that it isn’t the rotation that is challenging but the situations that are. Much like you said, fully understanding your utilities is essential. If you don’t you die and then have a shit run back from a far away site. 
---
Did someone say [thunderfury,blessed blade of the windseeker]?
---
Awesome! I'll drop by your discord!
---
&lt;3
---
Yay! 
---
Yeah, I noticed. Currently binging through all of them, haha. Never knew there is so much depth to music.
---
You'd be right if those actually existed.
---
Welcome to the wonderful world of musicology! :D I hope to help you find more awesome secrets with wows music soon! 
---
It's not "hard maybe" tbh, it has been confirmed.
---
You were just expressing an opinion in the original but you WENT OFF in the edit, what did you have, like 1, maybe 2 downvotes at the time?
---
Blizzard has ALWAYS been a conservative company with the information they release. Including back in the 2002-2006 era. They never show their full, latest progress, that’s quite par for the course; you can hear the vanilla team leader Mark Kern saying exactly this on ClassiCast #13. He hasn’t been at blitz for years but still knows they’ve always been pretty tight lipped about upcoming releases until they actually *have* to say something.
---
Therefore, the demand for and lack of a Q&amp;A is not a huge deal. It’s a manufactured controversy imo.
---
Alliance. All that matters in raiding is threat. Blessing of Salvation = easy mode. Horde requires a stupidly better tank that is often wearing dps gear, which makes it harder on the healers.
---
The best tanks for bad guilds is the one with higher health defensives. The best tank for good guilds is the one that can put out the most threat. Trolls (beserking on boss), Humans (weapon racial). 
---
Tanking racials just aren't as important as people make them out to be though. The person tanking is, because it requires a theorycrafter AND a good player behind the helm who has multiple gear sets and swaps.
---
Alliance are also better in premade pvp. I'm still going Horde though. Why? Cus I hate gnomes. I love when I kill a female gnome and it sounds like they say SEGA! Nothing makes me happier.
---
&gt; Keep calling me thick though, whilst you get surface level knowledge on wikipedia between posts.
---
Good christ, are you dyslexic? I never called you thick, but now I will. You are one thick motherfucker.
---
Currently levelling a mage for the first time since like 2005 now. Aside from all the drinking (especially right before you get new water) it's really fun, you have so much control as frost, and so many fun toys. And unlike everything else I've played (mostly warrior, haha) the talents and spells feel really well thought out. Only thing I feel like I'm missing from later expansions is ice lance. 
---
Before I was unsure if I should roll a warrior or a mage in classic, but after having played a bit more as a mage I've definitely settled for that option, at least for now. 
---
I didn't say for "proper" way! I said the proper version, which for me is vanilla and TBC! 
---
Getting the Ivory raptor before they are changed to the armored kinds, preferably get several for re-sale and make a nice buck to help gear and fuel alts :o
---
Actual PvE combat was trivial back then.
---
Literally two buttons as a rotation of a mage.
---
Macro that automatically dispelled a curse if there was some, or cast a frostbolt.
---
Arcane missiles when it procced.
---
That was all.
---
Have a nice day, you seem upset I would suggest going for a walk. Nice ad hominems though, screams to me you lack the ability to think logically. 
---
I think there is another reason why top guilds ran horde. top guilds had a bit more mature roster of players, many of which had already experience in other mmorpgs.  Horde looks a bit more serious and alliance looks a bit childish, so these  veterans rolled more horde.  
---
That's why top guilds ended up being horde, despite ALLIANCE actually having better racials (for pve at least)
---
-6
---
If I will try out vanilla, I will wait a few months.
---
A lot of players will drop it after a few weeks, and I do not want to play on an empty server.
---
50 DKP MINUS!!!
---
Came here to say this. Old school blizz was all about “when it’s ready” and “soon (tm)”. They never committed to anything in the past because it has the potential to backfire massively if that one thing a developer said off the cuff doesn’t transpire later on. The fact they gave us a rough release date already was above and beyond any balanced persons expectations. 
---
You want to use a two hander if you spec into mortal strike. The damage of mortal strike is calculated from your weapon damage. 
---
You would have a higher chance getting into a raid as an arms warrior than some retard "fury" warr who doesn't do any damage. 
---
that is pointless , there are hundreds of thousands pserver players and only a few noteworthy streamers .  
---
pserver players will just be like everybody else  except a little better informed.  I doubt you will see any difference a few months after launch. 
---
Please reserve looking for group posts to the Monday stickied "Looking For Group" megathread. Thank you.
---
Cocaine, not coca cola, go hard or go home
---
\- Getting to 60 for the first time
---
\- Raiding for the first time
---
\- AOE farming dungeons, making a twink
---
Umph, no.
---
Very often, clear exploits that are done publicly are not punished at all.
---
When mages could have 100% multistrike permanently, a lot of guilds suddenly managed to kill some bosses, often The Butcher.
---
A lot of them even had public logs... I personally reported several such guilds, and I know nothing happened.
---
Literally everyone is going alliance so probably them lol
---
Please use r/wowservers for private server discussion. r/classicwow is for Classic WoW (Rule #1).
---
We remove these posts when mods see them OR if people report them which is super helpful). For now, we're referring them to the Monday LFG Megathread that we sticky. We might come up with better solutions down the road.
---
-6 for the raging, flailing, defensive edit, you either can’t see that or don’t want to
---
Don’t pretend that shit was hard
---
No that was before the edit 
---
You can try whatever you want in PvP, but get a 2h if you are going to raid, otherwise your damage will be shit. Even if you spec into dual wielding using a 2h will still do more damage in Arms spec. 
---
raiding as arms with a 2 hander will be much better then dual wielding as arms
---
And for optimal play, you need [this](http://i.imgur.com/rTXSQ.jpg) gaming chair.
---
Is English not your first language? "Thick" has the idiomatic meaning of unfair or unreasonable:
---
Wiktionary:
---
&gt;(Britain, dated) troublesome; unreasonable
---
&gt;1969 Anita Leslie, Lady Randolph Churchill, New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, page 288:
---
&gt;"Of course I was eager to put her affairs in order," George told my father, "but I found it a bit thick when expected to pay for Lord Randolph Churchill's barouche purchased in the '80s."
---
OED:
---
&gt;Phrases
---
&gt;a bit thick
---
&gt;*informal* Unfair or unreasonable.
---
&gt;‘I thought this was a bit thick and tried to defend myself’
---
Some web sources also cite it as meaning "dubious" or "hard to believe", and while I'm familiar with this usage personally, I couldn't find it outside of [The Free Dictionary](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/thick) which cites its source as being from an American slang and colloquialism dictionary, so it's possibly quite vernacular.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Also, I thought you were supposed to block me.
---
That's precisely how I read it the first time.....
---
Key is to get everything done now, play every game, finish every series. Then no life classic
---
Play one of every class and both factions. Hunter has always been my main class but I’ve never played a priest or a paladin for example past level 10 for some reason and I’ve never been a healer before. 
---
Horde has more damage potential, but it's much harder to implement. 
---
Your tank really needs to have a good knowledge about the things he's doing and tryhard for threat generation. So if your guild has a Tauren MT in deep prot spec with the same Tier-set gear he uses on every fight, you are pretty much messed up as melee DPS.
---
&gt;Also, I thought you were supposed to block me.
---
I was but then I found your reaching and attempts at reasoning kind of endearing. And, no English is my joint second language of three, I learnt it in tandem with Spainish at school but I'd say I have used English more in the last few years than Spainish. Although I probably used English as much as Spainish when I went to a conference over in LA. Think some people in shops found it funny when a German guy was speaking Spainish.
---
300 defense is enough for all
---
Tauren have always been one of my favorite races behind only trolls and dwarves. I’m rolling a female Tauren shaman this time around. 
---
Restoration Shaman here since vanilla,  current gladiator in BFA and mythic raider. Raided on Nostalrius as well up to  BWL, got rank 10, and cleared MC on retail vanilla (was 10 years old so not much experience or memories. The start times for raids seem pretty good to me.
---
My current char is- ketoguido-emerald dream if you wanna look it up. If you need a resto shaman let me know. I don't really play alts 
---
Vurtne for mages. Drakedog for Warlock
---
My favorite vanilla mages just from top of my head are:
---
\- Vurtne (next level pvp from back in the day)
---
\- Ohhgee (more modern vanilla pvp with full potencial of gadgets, eng, and lot of skill)
---
\- Vanilla Flashback 5 (pretty entertaining)
---
... more just search youtube  ''mage vanilla pvp''
---
For Warlocks i really like:
---
\- Goth
---
\- Drakedog
---
Goth has done some nice pserver lock videos
---
 As said vurtne 1 is ixonic for mage
---
Alright cool. In the future try to remember that not understanding something isn't a reason to get upset. Also it's spelled "Spanish".
---
In terms of PvP people have, on average, gotten better at the game so watching some of the private server mages/locks would be better if you wanted an idea.

Wedding is pretty good

Don’t do it. I had to redo one semester back in the days. Believe me it’s not worth it. 
---
&gt; so humans have 4% more damage than a nelf with both having edgemasters
---
On white hits only, right? All ability damage is not affected by glancing blows. 
---
And how much effect does that 4% have on rage generation? I don't know those formulas, but rage generation obviously also affect overall damage. 
---
Old Quel'Sarrar proc.
---
Hey, could you link me that post? Didn't know before i made this post. 
---
Thanks in advance.
---
The only misunderstanding I had was the Q&amp;A blue post, your lack of clarity when using the word "thick" and your lack of knowledge even though you were talking from a position of authority (which you clearly don't have) was mildly annoying. I am more than happy to engage with people and learn from them but when their knowledge is clearly surface level but they are trying to con people into believing they know more that's where I call bullshit. 
---
Thanks for the spell check, you are now at levels of use to me on par with the paperclip in Word.
---
Yeah exactly - the DPS on any pet with 1.5 attack speed or less is essentially the same as Broken Tooth, so pushback is the only benefit.
---
I've never played the witcher 3, might just start it now.
---
We've got some good comments from CMs on the forums that sort of confirms that they are making Classic for those who want to play Vanilla and not those who want a frankenstein of Vanilla and BFA. 
---
There were some other good news as well but I can't remember what it was. 
---
I was pretty much just listing the memes. A ton of vanilla PvP videos have metal in them
---
There'll be many people who don't care for pirate server guides. 
---
more like a classic film in technicolor from the 1960s.  I like vanilla wow and one of my favorite movies of all time is Once upon a ime in the west, a film where nothing really happens for the first 10 minutes , yet it is considered one of the greatest scenes in cinema history
---
this sub is full of boomer memes 
---
Looks like you triggered r/wow OP.
---
Even if people wanted personal loot there were too many specs that wore different armor types. Warriors, shammies, hunters in leather for dps and Pallies, shammies, druids in cloth for healing. And it would be too much work for them to sort that out.
---
BUT GUYZ PSERVERS ARE SO INACURATE SO THEIR SKILL MUST BE WORNG AND THEY"D GET PWNNNNNNNED ON CLASSIC SERVERZ
---
It did not work for me.
---
In a video kargoz also said it doesn't work
---
Private server culture will be brought over for sure. But I wouldn't worry about lacking experience. First of it doesn't matter, you can start playing a game that others know more about than you, that's not a problem. And secondly there will be many other players with exactly as much/little experience as you, you won't be alone. 
---
Any streamers name?
---
Slutmog?
---
Awesome addition? I really hope this is just a bait thread. It's been discussed to death and literally proven to only be an awesome addition if you plan on behaving like an asshole.  
---
    
---
So, OP, do you plan on being an asshole?
---
Pretty bold reaction for a post that only as -3 karma. It’s not like all 50k members downvoted you...
---
It’s slowly turning into a Frankenstein though.
---
In Classic you can trade Bind on Pickup items as confirmed in dev blog.
---
This is not vanilla feature. It increases incentives to ninja and gives power to small groups of friends 2-3 running a dungeon together.
---
Then, they’re including sharding and in the demo summoning stones were working.
---
Even if you don’t think those are drastic changes it makes you wonder what’s next?
---
#BuildTheDam ^inLochModan

People telling me I'm good, or they like playing with me.

Alliance for better PvE racials, paladinbuffs, better placement of capital cities for travel to raids.
---
I'm going alliance.
---
This. Things have changed over the years and the PvP player base in wow have gotten much better at the game. But these two players are absolutely classic ballers in the Vanilla Wow PVP video world.

I agree, cancel the semester. You’ll only get one chance at classic WoW going live. You can school any time for the rest of your life.

I just flew through DFW
---
loot trading was specifically mentioned in the "These are hard choices, but we think we're going to do this" category.  It has not been confirmed, but they have said they are leaning that way.

This Strat can good when everything lines up and you don’t have a mount yet.  But there will be times when stuff comes up in real life that keeps you from logging in when you wanted to.  So that 6hr away time in the middle of the world could turn into 12 hours or more and you’ll be kicking yourself for not logging out in an inn.
---
It's been a long long time. But I remember the gadget teleporter working pretty well. The death ray was super lackluster, unless there's more mechanics to it than I was aware. I don't think I ever saw 1k damage from it. The other gadgets, eh, I don't remember anything in particular about them.

Do you live in a castle?

---
I don't like it but I think it'll do better than people think
---
You don't want to put up that debuff on the boss as it's only going to minimally reduce attackspeed but could potentially knock other important debuffs off. Plus the more damage your tank takes=more rage=more threat=the raid can do more dps
---
Uhhh Push it ! ;) 
---
You will, I usually hit 300 LW around lvl 45-47 grinding yetis in Feralas. Use the thick leather to craft nightscape tunics to vendor for a bunch of gold. 
---
Sometimes I use flight time to do inventory management.  Sort items between quest items, consumables, vendor trash, and AH items.  While going through the quest items I’ll occasionally look up an item on classic.db to verify what quest it’s from; most of the time I don’t need it anymore.
---
that is including calculations for the increased rage and then negating it for the fact whites aren't all your damage, although they are most of it, so yes it is 4%
---
The problem Blizzard doesn't seem to realize is that sometimes, less is more.
---
I know you are looking for pvp but that has been answered so i want to quickly mention “stupid mage tricks“ (there are 3 or 4 of those) by faxmonkey, some pretty cool solo pve stuff
---
Soon™ is coming.
---
to you all making some sience out of this if its true or not, remember its a meme lol
---
Teleporters worked really well, reflector trinkets as well, stuff like the net thrower were pretty lackluster if i recall correctly.
---
Okay, maybe I was wrong.
---
But imo even if he didn't say that directly, such statement probably means they have already made the decision.
---
Nope. Thunderfury,, blessed blade of the wind seeker!!!
---
Yeah you just want to hate on WoD and you can't admit the fact BfA might be even worse. I'd rather play that instead of piece of shit that BfA is and you can't change my mind about that. 
---
We haven't seen anything about that HoA rework and you're telling me it's happening. Are you serious? Something is happening yeah, but I'd like to see some details about it instead of not knowing anything and just waving with that "BUT IT'S COMMING". We're not even in 8.1.5 if you haven't noticed, and it's supposed to come in 8.2. 
---
I'm getting really tired of it, how people like you are hyping absolutely everything (Towelliee and his "hype" post about BfA comes to my mind). There's nothing wrong with being hyped, but convicing others about something we don't know almost anything about is ridiculous.

I hate posts with caps, i always think we FINALLY got some news :D 
---
&gt;That doesn't justify what people on /r/classicwow are saying.
---
Whatever you say. All I know retail players are just as toxic as Classic fanbase, if not more. Maybe people here are just getting tired from that shit "but Classic will dead in a few months" and things like that that retail players spread.
---
[Unknown II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GumyLbBf4o), though not the most skilled, has always been my favorite mage pvp video.
---
[Gegon - The Last Ovski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW5mv_e4ZmM) is also a very fun mage PVP video.
---
This is because combat status works differently in PvE than it does in PvP. In PvE you immediately drop combat as soon as the NPCs stop attacking you, but in PvP you stay in combat for some time (about 10 seconds IIRC) after the last combat interaction between you and an enemy player.
---
When you charge a nonhostile yellow mob, you're theoretically put in combat by the charge. However, because the stun does not aggro the mob (this is where the "bug" lies), you immediately drop combat because nothing is aggroed on you. In PvP you'll be subject to the PvP combat timer which isn't based on whether something is aggroing you or not.
---
I heard Lord Eddard was a big fan of Classic WoW. 
---
Watch [Saerdna 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRXUTgrZOvM) for Mage PvP. I always recommend him in these kinds of threads. [FMT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9hgXErSVJU) is also a good one.
---
Vurtne is a popular mention, but his videos are for flash. There's a lot of overdone editing that make it hard to see what he's doing, and there are blatant misplays just to flex on his opponents. Some encounters are also very clearly set up, and he faces some very clueless players. Fun to watch if you're unfamiliar with Mage PvP, which is why people always recommend him, but also very misleading.
---
Summoning stones were meant to be in vanilla, the technology just wasn’t there. sharding is only in starting zones which is a necessary evil for a massive launch. 
---
And With 2-3 people running A dungeon together anyway, there isn’t a whole lot of instances where people will be fighting over the same gear anyway
---
I wonder if they add in the need/greed system and cannot need on unequipable items rules. As far as I remember the original system had just greed and anyone could roll on anything. 
---
I am not hyping anything. I just said rework is happening and we know it will be more in line with how Artifacts worked, with Azerite armor being basically new version of tier sets.
---
You never stated "rework will be shit". You said "I will trust them rework is happening only after I see it". Which returns me to my previous point: I guess you also don´t believe we will be going to Nazjatar in 8.2 because you did not see it yet.
---
It was a joke :(
---
Also, there are warlock trainers in the tower above the city, so if you are a lock, you will be able to get your spells there too.
---
I am actually genuinely curious how they will handle exploits in vanilla actually. On one side, most of the exploits used in the past have already been patched and any others are well known and documented. On the other side, if vanilla is a success and the end game is static, who cares if players or guilds get geared unfairly... really only matters in PvP I guess. 
---
Lol, that is too funny. I always liked it because I was an orc shaman. I was hugely into warhammer fantasy and they ride boars so it was super fitting.
---
So everyone starts with no gold in TBC? lmao
---
Its hamma time
---
Would be cool if I could check out different Tauren Models with the T2 Druid Set, to make the choice. T2 is so awesome.
---
Play the game *enough* but not *too much*. If I can manage that then anything else is gravy.
---
I have a couple friends that are gonna play classic, one of them never had the chance to play it because he started in Cata, another one has never played WoW at all but wants to join us. So there will be people, probably a small subset of players but they'll still be there. 
---
On summoning stones, we should keep in mind the demo build was fairly shaky and not a true representation on what Classic will be like. That being said, when focus on Classic development comes up, bombard the developers with queries on summoning stone and other non-vanilla inclusions (within reason) to make sure they keep the feature as it was back in vanilla.
---
The wait between now and Classic is so hard. Right now I'm just trying to fill in the void with single-player games that have been on my backlog, such as the Kingdom Hearts series (in preparation for KH3) as I know I won't have time, or the need to play any other game for a long while once we get Classic.
---
The teleporters always get you to the destination, only sometimes they can drop you from high above (solvable by a parachute), prevent you from being summoned by warlocks for some time, stun you or just blast you with some damage. Nothing truly dangerous.
---
[4k crit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00RFpao_G1U)
---
it does physical so it scales with enrage + crits from recklessness. these are vanilla base values.
---
Or they could want to get a character to 60 as quickly as possible to start working on profession, gold farming and BiS while there is less competition. Then make an alt and enjoy the leveling experience. 
---
People who say you shouldn't rush seem to forget that you can have more than one character to enjoy leveling with. Dosnt have to be your first one.
---
Thats the answer you re looking for 😅
---
Moonwalking and froststabbing have absolutely nothing to do with each other, really... Moonwalking is a client-side graphical glitch caused by faults in the animation system. These faults have been patched in the modern client. I'd like it back, but I'm not very hopeful.
---
As for frontstabbing, that is definitely a private server glitch. Like many rogues I vividly remember trying this back in vanilla, trying to quickly strafe or shove my face into mobs to confuse the "behind" classification. It never worked.
---
thats literally what i said. MOST people who will play, already played it, not all. and there wont be many people who havent played any wow, didnt say everybody played. there will just be very few..
---
&gt;Ive also heard people say you have to stop dps so you dont out aggro the tank without salvation.
---
That's why you bring a bear
---
but most people dont want custom changed when talked about and just want vanilla (of course doing every patch and class change isnt viable) but just make it at least as good as something like nostalrius but scripted even better
---
Honestly, I don't know what either of those things are but they sure seem unpopular.
---
I’m not really gonna address your rant simply because if you’re going to put your opinion on the internet you should know by now it’s going to get hate no matter how thought provoking it may be. 
---
To your original point; I’m hoping this is a case of no news is good news as far as their progress as it relates to an on time release. 
---
Second, this is a very unique situation, it isn’t a new expansion. This is a recreation of a previous game, so the standard is essentially already set and given the fact that there is fierce debate on the changes/no changes front; a Q&amp;A could do a lot more harm than good from Blizzard’s perspective is my guess as to why we haven’t seen one.
---
I think Blizz is likely to retain more purists if they can get them in game and then say “sorry about these changes” than if they announce them all and a good amount of them choose not to even give it a chance as a result. 
---
Almost a better to ask forgiveness than permission type situation. 
---
Yeah forsure. I don't think anyone believes that classic wow is going to be made up of a majority of new players. That's just not realistic at all, it's a reboot after all. Those usually only attract the biggest fans 
---
Being surrounded by players who have played the game for over a decade and who are using guides and spreadsheets to dictate their actions is not an authentic experience. OP is concerned with the dominance of private server players... Which indicates to me that he IS concerned with the competitive atmosphere in Classic and is not looking to take his time and relax. If OP wants to find himself in the upper hierarchy of players on his realm, he should play private to gain an advantage. Private players will level quicker, know what gear to get and where, know what quests to do and avoid... This is not an authentic experience from retail vanilla, and being surrounded by these players WILL affect the authenticity of your experience regardless... But if you want to be competitive against private players, you will have needed to play private. Oh I know, I know, most of us were all grand warlord marshall rank 17 developer alpha naxx clearers back in retail vanilla and I am very sure you're all brilliant. The reality is that the meta has changed. You will see warriors on private who are swing timer kiting NPC's as 2 handed fury while wielding a staff and /sitting at the start of fights to proc all their talents while using full consumes to grind mobs. Some of these principles existed in retail vanilla, but now they are perfected and common knowledge. These players are at a distinct advantage. If you care to contend with them (most dont) you will need to be one of them.
---
Don’t know why you got downvoted, you were just asking for clarification.
---
You should break up all social contacts, buy a lot of food to survive without leaving your room. Whats more , you should actually try to modify your room by putting a fridge next to your gaming table.
---
Yeah. Deep wounds itself is constantly being knocked off before it even ticks and almost never contributes any damage, but impale is a great talent that fury warriors want.
---
It's also a great addition for people who aren't being assholes. 
---
My bf showed me wow classic and it was really easy for me to get to know the game being a warlock. I guess it depends on personal taste but i really liked it and im looking forward to be a warlock again when the game comes out!
---
one of my goals is getting to global elite in cs. i’m silver 2 right now you think i can make it
---
Indeed,
---
Horde has much, much higher damage potential with its WF melee, but requires far more skill from both its tanks to even keep up that much threat, and consequently way better healer players to be able to heal tanks in higher DPs/threat gear.
---
Alliance on the other hand have absolute easy mode options. Paladins can give out blessing of protection to clear threat on idiots who pull, only 4 paladibs are needed for all 4 "good" blessings, they don't need to worry about constantly replacing totems to not get aggro'd by patrols and radius, fear ward on tanks making them essentially immune, no threat if nefarian getting WF and one shifting your raid tanks, etc. Lastly, paladins are by far the most efficient single target healers in the game, and have virtually no skill floor to be able to heal well, assuming you resist the urge to want to melee something for zero DPs, all the while being able to divine blessing out of any aggro pull situation at a moments notice.  Too many "oh no I fucked up, undo!!" Options on alliance.
---
If you want to strictly do pve content with as little resistance and challenge as possible, roll alliance. Like it was in vanilla, I suspect a percentage of players will roll alliance over horde, with the exception of PvP servers where it will be even split. As long as you can live with the shame of being an alliance players go for it!
---
That strategy exists, but its not what it sounds like.
---
Wow, you're pretty confident huh? As someone who has played since retail vanilla, had several 60s during retail vanilla and made it rank 13 as a NE shadow priest, I can tell you that me and almost everyone else during retail vanilla had NO clue what we were doing. You included. I guess over 10 years of cumulative knowledge from millions of players will do that though... 
---
Disagree completely. You take the average retail player who is dealing with FAR more mechanics and nuances than we dealt with in vanilla, you tell them their proper itemization and spec and they will contend with everyone else in ability. The difference will be the grind. That being said, a lot of younger people who are currently playing retail will have A LOT more time than the average 9-5er.

I don't remember if Charge did not put you in combat in PvP in the demo, but I remember seeing [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/GloriousAmorphousDoveCopyThis) which demonstrates how it doesn't put you in combat against neutral mobs. As Brian says he tested this on the reference client and found it to be intended behaviour, and under the circumstances there is no reason to doubt him (as no one has found a video demonstrating him to be incorrect for PvE, *and* there's a patch note that mentions this being fixed in 2.1), here's my take:
---
The charge/stun effect counts as an offensive action and triggers combat in both PvP and PvE. However in PvE, it does *not* count as an offensive action as far as mob AI is concerned, so it does not cause mobs to aggro you. PvP and PvE have different rules for what constitutes "in-combat": in PvE, you're only in combat if there are mobs actively targeting you, and combat drops as soon as the mobs give up (leash/reset). In PvP, you're in combat for several seconds (I think 6?) after the last combat action is taken by or against you.
---
In short, this means that:
---
* In PvP, charging stuns the other player and puts you in combat. If neither party takes any further action, you will drop combat after the standard PvP combat timer expires, ie. after 5-6 seconds if I'm not mistaken.
---
* In PvE, charging stuns the mob and puts you in combat, **but this non-damaging stun does not aggro the mob**. This means that unless you take an action that causes the mob to aggro you (eg. auto-attack them), you will immediately drop combat. It is possible that this might happen within a single server tick, which could make it seem like you never enter combat in the first place.
---
As far as I can tell, this is EXACTLY the behaviour in PvE in the Classic demo. However, I have not been able to find a video of this in PvP, and while absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence... yeah, I have a suspicion that the demo actually worked exactly as it was supposed to in this regard.

Somebody could create a program that creates a set of characters with predetermined names and attributes faster than humanly possible.

Our masterlooter in BC fucked up so many times GM's knew his name. Most often it was obviously wrong, like items that couldn't be used by the person who got it.

But Deathbringer's Will was one of the two BiS trinkets for DKs regardless of their spec, but of course even more so for blood because they dealt more melee damage. Not sure why you were so upset about that.

Only retribution paladins would avoid it because they would rather want Tiny Abomination in a Jar from Professor Putricide.

try something new 
---
i have always been a dps player so i cant wait to try being a healer main LOL and maybe some off tanking
---
The mind Control cap depends on the intelligence difference between you and the target afaik. If a warrior tries to mind control cap a mage it usually backfires.
---
Blizz should allow them to reserve IMO. I would actually be okay with that being the pre purchase reward, reserving 1-3 character names on a chosen server. Perhaps even creating your full character a few days before release. Would shave off a ton of time on launch for some people.

Does no one write down anything by hand anymore in the US? 
---
It depends on what you like. I enjoy buffing random players with fortitude which really helps others with leveling and you'll make lots of friends in low levels if they like your healing. Mind controlling can be really fun in world pvp.  Warlocks are just nice to get around with. They can also support in a lot of unique ways. (Summoning,soulstones, healthstones) both are fun in their own right. Shadow can be fun but suffers from mana problems down the line so just play whichever class you like thematically.
---
&gt; literally proven
---
Are you sure you know what that means? 
---
I've played both to 60, and honestly I prefer Warlock.  You just bring so much utility to a group.   With Succubus/Banish, you offer just as much CC as a mage.  Plus, you offer healthstones and soulstones.  In vanilla, it's not uncommon to wipe in an instance, so SS is really nice.  Lastly, traveling time is a killer in Vanilla, so Warlock summon is so handy.
---
Leveling speed overall is about the same, though I might give a slight nod in favor of Warlock.
---
If you plan on going Alliance, then Warlocks will be even more sought after in raids due to fact that many will not roll lock against UD WotF in PvP.
---
As lock, you can spec SM/Ruin and be solid at both PvE and PvP.
---
Eh, I think it's a reference to Asmongold ( biggest WoW streamer ) getting so bored with BFA that he started playing something else, and the first one was Dark Souls. Took him like 6 hours to kill Artorias.
---
Yeah me too. I was also planning warrior. But between food, ports, blinking, insane dps, amazing CC, utility like frost nova, top tier farming and probably another 50 things, i just have to go mage lol.
---
my biggest annoyances are mindsets like "You like what i assume retail to be, despite not playing it since wrath, so you 100% Cant like vanilla!" and shit like that. Like just let people like what they want to like, They shouldnt need to fit into some Box of Liking or someshit
---
If u think about it, actually we have a way around this. In classic u will be able to have a "2 hour loot window" in dungeons now. So u can actually get a guy that boost you to the boss of WC, then when the boss is ready u enter the instance and go there, u might get like 50 exp/run but this way u can get leggings of the fang with ZG/Naxx ench. Unless ofc blizzard makes it so u can't trade an enchanted item within that 2 hour window
---
No option for World-PvP on either poll :(
---
I hope not.  With good communication in groups we would just say that if no one else needed an item I would need it and D/E it and then we'd roll on shards.  Made it super easy without too much hassle to determine what items would be sharded.
---
I'm finishing mine this upcoming spring and the timing couldn't be better.  Stay strong.
---
If you've played on private servers at all then you know that killing C'thun is way harder then farming trash in naxx.
---
I leveled a priest one time and was struggling by level 20, nobody had grouped with me yet, no guild invites, I was about ready to call it quits. Everyone had said play priest or warrior to get groups easy and meet people! 
---
Then out of no where a warlock and a warrior come charging up to me and ask me to run dungeons s with them to level. We spent the next 5 hours hammering dungeons. Most fun I've ever had in wow. The 3 of us went on to form a guild and lead raids and blasted through 5 mans nightly like crazy. 
---
I just want that experience again. Where you and a few people just click with and its so easy to play together it just makes wow so much better. It seems these experiences are random luck though.,
---
The backfire rates on these are almost impossible to know. The RNG used for them varies from 1 private server to another and there really isn’t a way to know what the “real” numbers are
---
I come here everyday with the same question "What is todays circlejerk about?"
---
They're going to allow loot trading? 
---
I always enjoyed running to the druids in Thunder Bluff. Up in the Elder Rise in their tent with a bunch of lore related ish around. Obviously druids also got a whole zone for this function as well.
---
Not that I’ve ever played one extensively but I like basically every warlock class hall. They’re always reclusive and to the side, so they can conduct their dark dealings without interference (the Cleft of Shadows comes to mind).

---
There will be loot trading yes (2 hour window).
---
But aslong as u can't trade an enchanted item it won't really be a problem
---
Anal [thunderfury, blessed blade of the wind seeker] is keeping me up at night guys, what do?
---
I always loved going down into the dark basements to visit the warlock trainers and feel like I was learning some dark magic in secret.
---
From what I've seen, a whole lot more consistent gearing at end game too. Unless you are just a tank (and even then for threat builds) warrior is kind of weird to gear. 
---
This loot trading thing has been pretty hyperboled while it wasn't clear how it will work.
---
The did state that it was to work that it could only be traded to members of the raid for the boss kill - which would deal with master looter screw ups.
---
If i remember couldn't you put zg/nax enchants through the trade window. I'm sure i read statements about that from players recently.
---
I think there is a video on youtube about this 
---
Pretty sure u can't, however u can put it on gray/boe items and trade it with them
---
You will be able to kill any class as hunter, considering how powerful kiting, scatter + trap is and you have hunters mark vs stealthers (hunters mark a rogue and you can easy beat a rank 14 rogue as a 50 hunter). You can also kill basicly any class with any gear as a rogue aslong as you got the right spec and CD's ready and you get the jump on the target. Hunter will give you a much easier leveling / solo experience, also opening up alot of farming options, like solo DM trib runs / mauradon for decent gold. Gearing up and solo grinding as a rogue will be a bit more difficult in the start, but you scale much better with gear as a rogue compared to a hunter and once you get geard you will destroy a hunters damage. Both classes are good, but hunter will give you a smoother leveling experience and it is easier to grind solo. The rogue will be more difficult to level and solo grind, but you will out dps hunters in PVE and you scale much better with gear. Both classes are strong in world PVP, your main problem will be frost mages with both classes, so just go for what you think you will have the most fun with :)
---
Sure
---
I think you misunderstood my point; I'll explain:
---
I was asking if we really needed such powercreeps. Were the changes necessary? Did we need a level 70 and 80? Wouldn't 65 and 70 have been enough?
---
Did we need to increase item power by the tenfold in Wrath and onward rather than keeping it "just an improvement" like in BC? 
---
Did we need to give LFR an easier version with practically free loot? Wouldn't have putting them in regular 25nhc been enough? 
---
Did we need badge gear that went from 100-150 badges in BC to 50-90 badges in Wrath down to 15-20 badges in Cataclysm to get current and competitive gear ?
---
Did we need to reward people with raid tier badges for completing 5 man's through Dungeonfinder? Wasn't the Dungeonrun enough ? And did we need them to be so much easier every braindead with an aoe ability could run them solo?
---
All these changes made the game stale and frankly; boring. 
---
If the game went a different route, and kept the essence of Vanilla while still providing change, innovation and further improvement, then I don't see how the game couldn't still be decently populated. Not necessarily as big, but definitely not as small. 
---
Embrace the darkness

1: Depends What class you play against, early/endgame and gear difference. Mages are generally better raid dps. Mages are better at gold farming (esp When DM is released) And warlocks can do elites better overall. I don’t know much about being wanted or PvP gear being any Good. I can only say mages and warlocks are both wanted. If I would guess I think mages are slightly more wanted.
---
None of these criteria matter anyways since Youll need to really love your class And they are both VERY different casters. I would go with the one that speaks to you. Youll be spending a lot of time with your char and it would be semi-wasteful to drop your main however it can Always become an alt.
---
The unique effects of the two teleporters are teleporting you a 1000 feet into air for gnomish and sets you on fire for 15% of your health every second for 8 second for goblins.
---
Other affects is swapping your appearance, stunning you and causing a polymorph for a minute. If I remember correctly, it was only 30-40% chance to get to the destination safely. With gnomish having the greatest success rate but higher critical failure. 
---
I think Blizzard should hire you man, you know your shit
---
Oh, now I understand. Then I agree with you and even though I think the basic idea of modern WoW (making sure you are always able to participate in current content rather than running older raids while everyone else does the new one), I also have pretty big problem with powercreep on the scale we have now (in terms of levels, item levels, stats and currencies).
---
1) Warlock is better 1v1 overall.
---
2) Warlock will be higher DPS in the long run in raids (though mages will be higher at the start of MC)
---
3) Mages can farm better
---
4) Both can find raids spots easily, though mages have an easier time finding dungeon groups.
---
5) Both have tier sets that are usable in pvp, but warlock tier 1 is pretty bad so you probably wont be getting much it if you use a DKP system (would be a total waste).
---
6) Both are good for world pvp, though like I said - Warlocks are better 1v1 and most world pvp is 1v1. Mages are very slippery and can escape wPVP if they don't want to fight.
---
&gt; This is a prime recipe for burnout and disappointment.
---
Nah.
---
I’m rolling horde specifically to kill gnomes and dwarves.
---
Warlock tower in Ratchet. I don´t know whether there are similar places for other classes outside of capital cities, but I always loved how there is this group of warlocks doing their thing and sending you on quests to get demons (felhunter and felsteed if I remember correctly).
---
Also, I was really surprised by how few players on my RP server actually knew about them and that was in Wrath, so they still played some role.
---
Even worse than Warlords? People are so blinded by hate they don't realise its not that bad. 8.1 was a huge improvement, and the second raid tier hasn't even launched yet.
---
Horde is the thot patrol of Warcraft 
---
Good luck, it's going to be a painful ride. 
---
Most people who think they will get to 60 within two weeks won't. Seriously underestimating the amount of time and how efficient they need to be with said time.
---
DM:E jump runs are pretty popular on pservers, always bring mining for those nodes also
---
MC will be on farm by PuGs by the time ZG comes out, if they are doing a proper release schedule.  Pretty much all the blizzlike pservers have MC on PuG farm by the time ZG comes out running it within an hour. 
---
I seriously don’t understand how this can take so long though? I mean private servers do it just fine right? 
---
I can respect that. Played WoW 2006-Cata also. Little bit in WoD. Now again on classic. Tried everything. No matter how strong casters are in theory or practice I just can’t get behind it. It doesn’t feel right to have to avoid the mobs. Kiting and watching casting bars isn’t fun for me. I want to just hit them and do big white damage. Took me way too long to discover warrior, but I knew it was everything I ever wanted, the class with direct problem solving - apply axe to face.
---
Honestly there are really close on all of your points. T1 lock set is only usable in pvp, mage is equally terrible for pve, not sure for pvp though.
---
All in all soul link lock in wpvp is probably the best  spec in the game for 1v1, but for group play mages are arguablx better
---
Exactly this.
---
It's a male set of custom looks.
---
Pretty sure in Retail the Item becomes Soulbound if you enchant it.
---
One thing about warlocks: in pvp horde is better because you dont play vs wotf, in pve alliance is way better since locks with good gear are constantly thread locked and as such depend of salvation. For mages this does not matter outside naxx when you get ignite rolling
---
Ninja loot Nefarian on a first Kill 
---
Sounds awesome, warriors are brainlets so it makes sense 
---
As a paladin I always loved the Cathedral with its little paladin room over to the right hand side. As I rolled on an RP server there was almost always some kind of alliance light-themed RP happening in or around the cathedral every time I went to train.
---
It always felt like the Cathedral was a thriving part of the city life and I was just respectfully walking through on "official business" to see the paladin trainers in the east wing.
---
It helped that Stormwind was probably the most "alive" city in Classic. All the cities were nice but the sheer amount of NPCs walking around and having daily routines made it feel lived in, rather than Ironforge which was a fantastic marvel but felt more like a war bunker in a lot of areas.
---
The net gets me like 80% of the time 
---
Dude, its the US...what do you expect?
---
Items in the retail client become soulbound when you enchant them. If you try to enchant them within that two hour window you get a prompt that tells you the item will no longer be traceable and you have to click “accept” to complete the enchant. 
---
If you do not click accept the item does not gain the enchant, and remains traceable. 
---
Not an issue at all. 
---
Drakedog
---
when nost came out in 2015, most of their work came from open source mangos which has been worked on for a decade at that point. a lot of servers have their own work done but pretty much every server is based on open source code thats been worked on for years and years
---
im not actually a developer and dont know much but im just saying private servers didnt just pull it out their butt and make a good server 
---
&gt;craft &amp; trade
---
a.k.a stand AFK on IF bridge/Org bank.
---
there's no reason to cherry pick this hard, it just makes you look dumb.
---
Eh, I mean the Nostalrius dudes already pointed out that a full 1/4th of their GM tickets were over Loot Trading, so it'll be a thing no matter what.
---
Shamanoodles
---
&gt; I mean it's a prebeta demo based on retail
---
Yep, but most players don't understand, which is why we can't have nice things.
---
You referenced it but yeah, moonglade is not only extremely comfortable and peaceful but also super convenient with the direct TP to the area. Extremely hard to beat.
---
2) where are you getting that source? From the old Nostalrius dps logs from Naxxaramus, Mages were top in average dps. Warlocks did grow the most in terms of % when jumping from tier 1 to tier 3 raid gears so yes they scaled the most in comparison to tier 1 gears. But Mages were top.
---
moonglade was awesome. I remember for the lunar new year other classes could come, and someone never left. I asked him why not make a druid up to level 10 or so so he could visit whenever he wanted. He never thought of that and thanked me! lol
---
I love it
---
This bug is actually going to go through but not for the way you think. Using an enchant that's not BOP causes the item to become soulbound the moment you use it. Removing the 2 hour window. Many of us actually know how to get around it though. So lol.
---
they are both imo the strongest classes in terms of individual power in the game for pvp
---
I had a buddy play the demo and try it. He managed to get it to work a couple times, but not nearly often enough to be viable like pservers. 
---
Technically it’s still possible but it’s not going to be something you really do. 
---
There is a glitch around it and twinks have been using it for since cata. 
---
I watched this during blizzcon. I remember what Ion said about authentic experience etc. 
---
I could understand their reasoning for sharding at launch being a hard decision, but loot trading? 
---
I mean, if they limited it to raids only, that would make sense at least.
---
A little help needed here. I played rogue in wod and legion, and loved it a lot, both pvp and pve. Thinking about rolling one in classic. Can someone give me a quick 1-2 sentence review or pros/cons about both leveling and end game pvp and pve? I will definetly find a guild before launch so soloing wont be a problem.
---
Not even close, 10 NR is nearly nothing compared to the TPS you output with weapon spec from human bonuses.
---
A glitch came forward around cata and is still doable in retail to get around it. 
---
I played a balance Druid. *mic drop*
---
And I’m also planning on rolling one for Classic because I never learn 
---
1. Warlock. They are probably the best 1v1 duel class. That or shadow priest.
---
2. Mages were top dps in raids. Warlocks were 4th. This is Naxxaramus logs
---
3. Mages were the best farmers in the game. 
---
4. Both easy to find raids. But getting gears is much harder as a Mage because they are the 2nd most played class. 
---
5. Not capable of answering this.
---
6. Warlocks probably better because fear causes people to run into mobs and get aggro'd. And Warlocks can take on multiple enemies with fear, seduce.
---
&gt;Even worse than Warlords?
---
WoD was lacking content, but mechanics were absolutely fine. BfA maybe has bigger amount of content, but what content? Warfronts, expeditions, invasions, dull and boring azerite armor? Yeah, it's worse than WoD in my opinion. You don't have to agree with me but I won't change my mind about that.
---
&gt;People are so blinded by hate
---
Have you thought about that maybe people aren't blinded, but they aren't blind fanboys and they see how terrible it actually is?
---
&gt;they don't realise its not that bad
---
No it's not bad, it's just terrible. 
---
&gt;8.1 was a huge improvement
---
Are you for real? Like in what ways was the game improved so much you call it a "huge improvement"? Because that new questline was boring and I don't care about the new islands and warfont. Yeah we got a new azerite vendor with absolutely overpriced azerite pieces, yay! And the best thing? Titan residuum isn't farmable, so it's timegated. Also no changes to azerite armor, we have to wait until 8.2! Such a huge improvement, really.
---
&gt;the second raid tier hasn't even launched yet.
---
Which is kinda ridiculous, releasing a new raid one month after the patch in the expansion where people are leaving because there's nothing to do.
---
Full t2 paladin set.
---
Warsong
---
I was like 16 years old when Vanilla started. I had played a few MMOs before WoW. I was not bad, I just didn't care to get informed. I simply played the game and learned along the way.
---
Today I usually find out what to play, where to play it and how to play it best before I even create my characters. (Thanks to Alpha/Beta/Asia releases). There is a ton of information out there before you even install the game, usually.
---
Paladin trainers were on the left, on the right there's a First Aid trainer :) also in the basement there's a diplomat from the Scarlet Crusade!
---
I levelled to 60 never once using poisons and didn’t do the associated class quest. Ended up asking a GM how to get them.
---
I played around 5th grade. I made a Tauren hunter named Bobby on Echo Isles. I decided to melee as a hunter because arrows cost too much money. I died too many times to count prior to level 10. Level 10 should have been easy street after my hunter quest, and I knew exactly what I wanted... a raptor. I saw other people have raptors when I went to Thunderbluff. I got a raptor and I never wanted it to die because I knew if it hated me enough it would leave me. I would actively attempt to melee face tank as a hunter so my Raptor wouldn’t hate me. I made it to level 47. I might have had the most deaths recorded on a pre-60 character. I told people my pet could Tank Ragefire Chasm when I hit level 15, and back in the day the group actually attempted to complete the dungeon... pet could take 3 hits before imploding. I loved classic. I’m on mobile going off the top of my head sorry if it’s jumbled.
---
Hunter. It's just super easy pve
---
As soon as you said nelf hunter I knew it was gonna be bad.
---
Some things never change.
---
I ranked SM Lib TODAY, in 2019, on a pserver. The group leader was an underlevelled nelf MELEE hunter with an even more underlevelled pet. He insisted on pulling the packs himself, especially before healer and others were ready (I was warr, but rest of the group were mana users and needed to drink), and “kiting and FD” instead of letting me get aggro. He would go into new rooms before the rest of the group and either he or his pet would pull the whole thing. He would only use freeze trap when we were going up against one mob. 
---
Melee hunter. Being the puller. 2019. I just pulled the classic tank move and threatened to leave unless he stayed at the back and used his bow. 
---
He still made us wipe on the last boss by solopulling it while the healer wasn’t ready.
---
Anyway, I didn’t know jack shit in vanilla. Played Druid, wore a total mishmash of int and agi gear, and spammed wrath on every mob til at least lvl 45. Despite being feral spec.
---
Warlock and rogue are hard tied for me. 
---
Okay this is EPIC
---
Leveled an undead rogue called Manshack, whilst leveling i got incredibly lucky and got the Sentry Cloak and Feet of the Lynx to drop on the same character, I got super excited and equipped them both immediately. I still cringe a little when i think about how much gold I could of gotten at such a low level.
---
Yeah good point.  Not a ton of handy vendors like trade supplies/etc IIRC but Crossroads is right there, and it has all that. 
---
Yeah I mean... there's only one Esfand or Asmon.  Obviously other people are gonna be like LOL I STOLE HIS NAME but like.. whatever.  It's like those folks that buy popular URLs and then try to sell them back to big companies. 
---
While I do play an Orc DK now, I played a Tauren Warrior. I was only about 5 years old at the time, and it showed.
---
I did the same thing in regards to gear as you, thought different color = automatically better, I sucked at pulling, always getting caught in fights with 3 enemies at once and wondering why I kept dying all the time, and I don't think I even made it past level 25.
---
Consumable? What's a consumable? That about summed up my philosophy. I did know what talents were, but I had no idea how to maximize their use, I would just pick them from left to right, top to bottom, never branching out into the other trees, since I couldn't read many of the words to see their effects.
---
I didn't know that you were supposed to occasionally repair your gear, and it doesn't help that my asshole sister lied to me and said that the red armor meant my armor was supercharged. To top it off, my preferred movement buttons were the arrow keys.
---
Yeah good answer.  Can easily do the lasher packs, and if you are able you could get that first two bosses to be able to talk to Tree dude, open the last hall, farm more lasher packs and do the last boss.  Tons of rare herbs and then the rich thoriums if you make it to the end.
---
We'll build the Dam and make the dwarves part for it. 
---
I was pretty good, but I also was in my 20s and was used to min-maxing from having played many other RPGs prior to WoW.
---
They got nerfed hard after like 2 months though. I remember it well; it was the catalyst for TotalBiscuit quitting.
---
Umm they did get it right. Did you guys not read turdas post?
---
Charge puts you in combat in PvP situations because it stuns the opposing faction. But in PvE on a neutral mob it was coded differently and didn't place you in combat until you actually swung at the mob.
---
buddy i remain bad. ima click my spells and play on a macbook air with no mouse and still have a ton of fun chilling in a fantasy land with my old friends. being bad rules.
---
Wrong it does matter. It functioned differently on neutral mobs than it did on hostile mobs and pvp. I remember it specifically. I used charge to literally get to my destination faster and I remember needing neutral yellow npcs to make it work.
---
Yall need to stop assuming you know everything....
---
extremely easy to beat. thunderbluff trainers are cheaper.
---
Rolled a warrior because hey they can tank right so they can take lots of damage before they die right so questing should be easy while I learn the game right?  Right?!? 
---
At least the tanking bit was right, although that never happened, frustration set in very fast so I rerolled a mage, making my own food and water was a greatest thing ever haha
---
Looking for info on how this works, couldn't find anything with Google fu. 
---
Charge worked differently on neutral mobs and non hostile mobs at that time in vanilla. You all should re-read the interview. He was specific about it being neutral mobs. And hes actually right about that too. Although you had to hit escape to cancel your autoswing or you would enter combat.
---
Their reference server is right.
---
WoW was my first RPG, i started a mage and tried to sell muffins i conjured, did not understand why they didnt sell and why they kept dissapearing when i logged back inn the next day. I also rolled on all swords with more damage, since i figuered i could be a melee mage... didnt know what wands were before level 40. Rerolled shaman and once i reached 60 half a year later i had finally learned about the different stats and what the different classes were about.
---
I mean look at how many doomsayer posts about debuff limits being gone, something that they explicitly said was going to be in the final product, because of the demo. Retail has people freaking out about a missing portal to ironforge on the PTR, not all portals missing, just one, and people are trying to say ironforge is going to be destroyed out of nowhere. 
---
Saerdna is my favourite vanilla mage.
---
i dont get it. whats wrong with balance?
---
Yup. I've always thought Saerdna was the better player.
---
This is probably the best if all those rich veins remain.
---
only reason you would watch og is if you want a lesson on how to not play mage. The kid ranks to 14 twice but still doesn't know how to properly use his abilities; frostbolting sheeped rogs from maxrange, running into blinds to skull it etc, his movie is straight up embarresing.
---
*No game rules forever, my son.*
---
(Unless it's WoW Classic)
---
I was going by the charts from my guild on Nost. We had 4 warlocks (I was one of them), and after a bit of epic gear, there was only 1 mage that was ever in the mix with the warlocks. We didn't do T3 content though, so that may differ.
---
hex of weakness and shadowguard are too.
---
8.1 wins in my book because of the Dark Souls reference. 
---
Any Dad's out there with not a lot of free time? I can't wait to play classic, but it's going to be a bit hard for me to find people to play with who have a similar lifestyle.
---
I'm from New Zealand if that helps, would love to find an oceanic guild or people to play with. 
---
I meant the ambiance, not price. That being said TIME IS MONEY FRIEND.
---
Agreed. Some of the other suggestions in this thread are cool, like warlock and paladin, but moonglade clearly takes the cake. 
---
Really felt like it’s own neutral little enclave, and it was very cool that druids got to teleport and hang out there whenever they wanted. Made druids feel like the most neutral class, like they were more loyal to the cenarion circle rather than their faction. It was the biggest space dedicated to one class. Was also a Warcraft 3 map, so that’s a bonus.
---
Never leveled either to 60, but I remember rogues and warlocks having very cool trainers tucked away in secret chambers which I thought fit perfectly with their class's reputation. 
---
The warcraft rpg mentioned a "Tauren Plaguebender" who's purpose was to cleanse Lordearon of scourge taint.
---
Here before the storm hits
---
You probably don't know this since you're 12 years old but vurtne defined mage pvp for the years to come, taught millions about proper keybinding, movement and how to use engineering. At the time his vids were made everyone was keyboard turning and the main reason they weren't in the years after was because they had watched players like vurtne or those who imitated him. 
---
Started the game when I was 12 a few months before BC launched. Played human warrior. Early on I distinctly remember putting points in the Protection tree and using sword and shield. Have some memories of getting completely rekt over and over by the fireball casting whelps in redridge and doing Deadmines runs that were so fail I didn't realize we weren't even in the instance yet by the time the group fell apart after wiping too much. 
---
Definitely bought white gear from vendors and didn't have first aid.  WoW was the first game I played that had 3D camera controlled by the mouse and I was very frustrated at times trying to figure out the controls. By the time I was in the 30-40 range I wised up and went 2h arms, thank god.
---
Fast forward half a year and I'm 70 hovering around 1800 rating in 2s as arms warrior/felguard warlock combo playing my first arena team with a friend. Times were different back then.
---
Become Warchief :D 
---
Its funny that WotLK is exactly where things really started going wrong for WoW (I mean you could argue that Late Vanilla with cross realm BGs or BC with flying is where things started to go wrong but I feel wrath introduced a lot more of todays problems with easy epics and lfd).
---
I was on the right of the curve for the day. I wasn't nearly as good at the game as I am anymore. Watching old videos of "good" players sometimes makes me giggle.
---
The difference is that the playerbase knows so much more about the game than back then. It was rare to watch people making extensive use of engineering in that day, for instance. The number of people raiding AQ40 and Naxx was minimal (my server had only one Naxx guild on both sides and I don't think either ever even downed 4HM).
---
Technology has played a part too, as internet speeds are overall better.
---
Wow, first one of these I've seen. That was fantastic. **Please** keep making them.  
---
You won’t be able to. Any modification to the item or equipping the item makes it soulbound. Always has with loot trading.
---
Night elf hunter.
---
Rolled need on an int staff the mage wanted and I defended myself for needing the mana.
---
At least my pet had taunt turned off...
---
It's easily the worst raid spec in the game. It's terribly mana inefficient and brings almost worthless raid utility. In pvp it lacks survivability and is, again, mana inefficient. Feral is better in every way for leveling.
---
There's just no place in the game that another druid spec wouldn't be better. 29/11/11 hybrid for pvp is the closest to viable that balance gets.
---
I guess you didn't see the blizzcon presentation or read the dev watercooler article? Check it out, they're really insightful.
---
I want to play this with my daughter who is 11, any advice for introducing her to the game? I assume she will just pick a race that looks cute, and give little thought beyond that. I'm ok with that, but is there any good content that might help a 11 year old get excited to play a new game with dad?
---
Thank you! I certainly will :D 
---
You ran out of mana in like, 2 seconds.
---
So while you could easily fuck up a player who didn't have nature resistance, the average dungeon/raid encounter made you look like a goofy idiot.
---
There's a reason they were nicknamed "OOMkins".
---
I honestly think MoP is where it started to fall down cause of LFR and warforging (thunderforging i think) but i still liked MoP. WoD was terrible, legion was okay but also not that good, and we don't need to talk about BFA. I don't believe retail will ever be good again because all the people that worked on the older (good) expansions left and some new people and activision took over. I am glad that classic will come out this summer
---
Underperforms strongly in PvE on long fights due to mana problems. Has its uses on bursts or farm content, moonkin aura on current content does not make up the usual dps loss though.
---
But its not so bad. Only people who "know better" and think they are hardcore will say no to you, because obviously you wont give them world 10th.
---
Let's just say there's a reason they were called "OOMkins". They had no mana return whatsoever, and their abilities were super mana inefficient.
---
whats divine blessing
---
Not really. I never took to any of the factions.
---
Look, if you feel faction RP is important to you then don't switch. Are you missing out on half of the game? Yes. But who cares, enjoy whatever parts of the game you want to.
---
Nah more like TBC. Beta of the LFD system, it was just rough and no one used it. Different difficulties for PVE content which broke up the community. Dailies replacing real, organic content. Dead community and all you knew was your guild due to flying and cross realm BG's. Catch up mechanics were in Sunwell area before WOTLK. Arena was a mistake like the lead devs said and led to class homogenization. AV was butchered because they made a smaller minigame (Arena) all that mattered instead of the larger one they had. BG's were ruined because healers with resilience are stupid and they had to last through CC chains that the game should never be balanced around.
---
TBC only gets a pass because a ton of people started in TBC, the leveling experience was still fun from vanilla WoW and then they did Kara, which is why there is so much nostalgia for Kara . Outside raiding TBC is complete trash. WOTLK did the minigames better and it was still not a good MMO. The only reason community kind of worked in WOTLK is the raids were so easy I pugged them, so I got to know lots of people that way. Wintergrasp added to that as well. Then LFD killed it all.
---
Everything past Vanilla is bad though. The rose tinted glasses doesn't apply to Vanilla. It's TBC. WORLD of Warcraft became WORLD of MINIGAMES.
---
uhhhhhh
---
Panda may have been the the obvious point. But the flashes of the future were clearly in Wrath. LFD instead of folding dead severs. Moving into cata talent changes to make it Easier to understand for people that just came to the game. The 4 different difficulty of raids. Looking back its easier to see the issues leading to the decline than it was when we played.
---
wtf you talking about? 24/0/27 is the best raidspec.
---
I am inclined to agree, since WOTLK was the final nail in my retail WoW coffin.  It felt to far away from the original game I loved.
---
who was talking about boomkin shit?
---
No, you can start with as much gold as you had in vanilla, but it will be deleted off your vanilla character, just as all your items on your vanilla character will now be bound.
---
I’ve actually seen a video of an ele sham in naxx in top 10 dps, for what it’s worth. That seems more than viable to me.
---
Moonglade is a clear winner here.
---
That said, the secret warlock demon summoning chamber hidden underneath a bar in Stormwind always amused me. 
---
My first character was a Tauren Warrior on a trial account when I was 12, a little before TBC came out. I died at least 6 times while inside the quilboar den near Camp Narache because of over pulling mobs. Same thing happened with the gnoll camps once I got past the starting area. I probably got to level 13 or 14 playing pretty regularly within that 10 day trial. I couldn’t afford to buy the actual game yet, so I made at least 5 or 6 other trial accounts and played a different race/class on each doing essentially the same thing each time until I could buy the game and chose my Troll Rogue. While leveling up, I couldn’t manage my money at all because I kept buying small upgrades to gear off the auction house and chose enchanting and engineering as my professions because I thought the benefits from both would save me money in the long run. Couldn’t figure out why my auctions never sold when I didn’t list BO prices with the item. My bank space was always full because I kept meaningless items left over from quests and holiday events thinking I may need those items in the future. And on top of all that, I essentially used only Ambush, SS and Eviscerate while clicking abilities and keyboard turning with the arrow keys.
---
I broke up with two of my girlfriends already! two more to go... Wooo!!! Summer time, Come On Downnnn
---
Meters lie with mages in Nax. They are still among the top dps but rolling ignite skews things. Warlocks are fine in every tier in 1.13 (Classic). The only time they sucked was Tier 1 and 2. 16 debuffs solves that. They might initially be a little lower due to hit talents on mage, but as soon as they get a few hit items, ring or whatever they might actually be ahead because frost kind of sucks. 
---
Hunters on the other hand are complete trash in Naxx. They are really going to have to fight for those spots.
---
Was 12 at the time, played a warrior, and tried to raid as arms... At least PVP was fun
---
This obviously shouldn't turn into an epeen thing so I'm curious what made pvp today different than prior. Vanilla was a very easy game to figure out. 
---
Are you really going to speak for other people?  I knew plenty of rank 12s and 13s who had 0 clue. And plenty of people who didn't pvp much but did.  
---
So yeah. What great tech came about?  Btw i maged and only maged. 
---
Sounds like you really love casual, unorganized PvP on large objective maps with PvE gimmicks.
---
that shit adds up.
---
Ravenholdt is this on another level. Very exclusive, tucked away, and very hard for any non rogues to get reputation.
---
/r/humblebrag
---
Naxxramas shoulder enchants could be applied to another players shoulders through the trade window on retail. I led weekly runs during TBC and sold the enchants to twinks.
---
Why should this be stopped? The whole point with vanilla is that the babywheels come off and you can do and invest as much as you want into what you find the most fun. People don't start twinking because it's balanced and fair, they do it because they want to run around and destroy players who barely understand what's going on.
---
What about stealth aggro range and Pickpocketing?
---
... what?
---
&gt; Arena was a mistake like the lead devs said and led to class homogenization
---
I agree 100%. This is probably one of my most unpopular opinions of WoW. Ranked instanced PVP destroyed class fantasy and the RPG feel of classes (lfd helped as well though). When Blizz introduced Ranked arena PVP with small group numbers, suddenly every class needed to be viable or people would complain so classes become homogenized. We also can't have unique classes on each faction anymore as one may be more viable than the other, so Alliance got Shamans and Horde got Paladins. 
---
I only say wrath was worse because it is when Blizz really ramped up their attempt to kill social community feel in the game, but you are right that they beta'd it in TBC.
---
In a lot of ways Ironforge is a War bunker. After seeing Grim Batol fall into such disrepair I'd hardly imagine the Dwarves being lax at all about protecting their city under strict laws and curfews.
---
Heroic raids was the first major turning point for me. So after Ulduar everything has been going in the wrong direction. 
---
WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT BOOMKIN SHIT?
---
My bad, had dark souls on the mind. Meant Divine Protection.
---
I loved WotLK actually 
---
Get the Winterspring tiger mount on my main, which will be a gnome mage.
---
Kek.
---
Sad but true. 
---
Don't get me wrong, it still had some good elements in it that made it enjoyable. I am just saying that when looking at the journey from Vanilla to BfA, you can see the stat of some decisions that led to WoW being in the state that it is in today (though as pointed out TBC also has a lot of blame).
---
You can still like a game while exploring and understanding its flaws.
---
Agree with everything but catch-up mechanics. Vanilla had more effective catch up mechanics than TBC.  They just required more effort/theorycrafting to realize.
---
I don't think I ever ate or drank in vanilla. I was definitely well into my 30s before I got rid of the refreshing spring water you started with. I felt as though I always needed to save it for some "special occasion."
---
Perhaps it wasn't as bad as I thought, though, as I was playing a shaman and thought that spirit was the most important stat for shamans. I had at least 2x the spirit as any other stat. Paired with troll regen, I might have actually been able to make it through areas without eating or drinking (or doing any damage). I would however make sure to press X to sit down for the very slight boost to hp regen.
---
First off Classic is 1.13 and many answers don't take that into consideration. "Classic" is not real vanilla and it's also a different ruleset than on private.
---
1) SL Lock beats things way easier. Frost Mage is in no way bad at 1 v 1 though and is much more bursty. This is with their best duel spec though. Both classes have specs with more burst that sacrifices survival for more fun. Both classes are fun because you can switch it up when you get bored with one spec in pvp and play something else. 
---
2) They are pretty even all the way to the end under the Classic ruleset, mostly due to debuffs. Mages might start off slightly higher due to hit talents. Then locks might be a little ahead, then when mages go fire they are close and it depends on how fast a guild kills something.
---
3) Locks can farm DM fine. Mage is probably easier at it though. Once you learn to Blizzard AOE, it's a joke. Dire Maul is in at release in classic so the big advantage farming Mage had is gone. Locks could farm elites though in the world before that. Locks were never really bad at gold farming, mages just could always do it in a instance easier
---
4) Under 1.13 probably the same.
---
5) Mage tier 1 is garbage. Mage Tier 2 is ok. Lock Tier 2 is nice. Past that you are going to have REALLY nice gear from PVE and in many cases it can be better than rank 14. Both classes do well in tier gear. I think I should mention that most tier 1 is awful for pvp though and some classes have to wait until AQ/ZG to get good gear. So both classes are in a real good place here.
---
6) Leveling Lock is stupidly better at wpvp, because the aoe spec blows for mage. In raid spec lock is better at wpvp. With PVP spec I would say they are really close. Mage can get away when outnumbered easier though. 
---
In premades Locks are more about damage while mages are more about utility. Mages are not a good class if you want to lead dmg in a BG. You can lead kills in AV, but any ranged can, except maybe shadow priest. They will go oom too much, range is a little too short. 
---
t. wrathbaby  
---
I love to circlejerk!
---
Weird how so many people here just didn't play properly. I don't understand why you'd play a mmorpg and not even try to play it properly. 
---
LK is when tanking died as an art form. No more pulling groups back, no more marked targets, no more skill needed for threat-building. And it's when people stopped talking in groups. Every dungeon was a boring-as-fuck, completely silent speed run where all you had to do was auto-run through and mash the buttons. 0% effort, 0% engagement. Also, DKs somehow usurped Hunters as the most annoying class to have in your group, which is fucking impressive.
---
I will never understand why so many people look back on LK so fondly. It's when the game died for me.
---
I love this idea! 
---
I leveled as holy on my priest. I can still remember being in stv and being stoked to finally get holy nova 
---
Casual PvP
---
&gt; what made pvp today different than prior 
---
Specs are much more clean and efficient. Instead of the top 2-3 players in a given BG downranking their spells and playing properly, everyone is. People are juking out fake casts etc to bait interrupts, just as they are in high ranked arena play in retail. Players are using weapon swap macros to use various weapon procs and stack effects. Players are VERY very macrod, including cancel attacks etc etc etc, which allows for combinations that werent being done in retail vanilla. Itemization is very fleshed out and players are using perfect sets of gear collected from both PVE and PVP to produce insane numbers AND are using addons that manage gear to seemlessly swap between entire sets in quick succession to flesh out more through put depending on the situation. 
---
&gt; please don't say stuff like wanding and engineering. It was known.  However if you want to say it wasnt widely used I'd agree with you 
---
Engineering is on another level than you remember... CONSUMES for that matter are different than you remember. They are using EVERYTHING. Everything. You are in a random BG in WSG and not even premading and you will run into a TON of players using consumes like pots, scrolls, engi and VARIOUS world items like magic dust. People spamming deviate delights for effects... Its ridiculous. I think I used more than the average consumes in vanilla, especially as I was so active in pvp. The list these guys are using for consumes and the consumes they are stacking are nutty.
---
I am one of those weird people that love the Undercity (once I was able to figure out how to actually get to the city). I have fond memories of visiting the different quarters to train spells, specifically the magic quarter for warlock stuff and the war quarter for priest stuff. 
---
Had a guildy's gf bring a rogue to a Karazhan raid without poisons. If I could go back in time I would have whispered her to ask her to apply some... but I was a young, immature asshole and called her out in raid chat.  Embarrassed her pretty bad.
---
I was pissed off because everyone else was really trying and this person just showed up in greens without even knowing their class, but I still regret how I handled it.  I could have been much more tactful. It was a life lesson and I like to think that I'm better at dealing with people nowadays.
---
everyone can access moonglade, druids are just the only class with a teleport
---
Right in the feels 
---
The eternal darkness, got to get to 60 somehow!
---
I like the Forlorn Cavern in Ironforge where the warlock trainers reside, pretty peaceful compared to the rest of the city.
---
So you have a vanilla character without money? 
---
Then we might as well transfer every character.
---
Items are a non issue.
---
1. lock
---
2. equal
---
3. mage
---
4. pvp/dungeon: mage, ally raid: lock, horde raid: equal
---
5. lock
---
6. lock
---
difference isnt big in any aspect
---
Well seeing you thought WoD Sub Rogue was good I can safely say you are a bad rogue and I have forgotten more about the class than you will ever learn. WoD was when rogue became accessible to people like you in PvP due to being redesigned by a guy who played on a stencil tablet (Celestalon).
---
BTW since you are none too bright and actually think arena still matters (it's dead at high rankings which you have never seen) the reason AV was good is it got PvE players into PvP (so you actually had people to play against unlike now), and PvP players into PvE. I would be one. I thought PVE was a joke. . I came from Ultima Online which had much more complex dueling specs/classes, where if you died you lost all your sh@% and only started playing WoW because I heard mage and rogue were kind of fun. The people who loved PVE mostly came from Everquest which I thought was a gigantic pile of sh#% (no offense to those who liked it). AV got people to engage in a large team activity and get to know people from 2 very different demographics. That was the whole point of original WoW btw. It was a CASUAL MMO that delusional people like you think is an esport. 
---
Get it now or do I need to draw a picture in crayon. Anyways enjoy the garbage tier bracket of Arena. You will never get higher than the sell bracket, where you can't even beat the carries...
---
it took me a full second to turn 180° bad
---
I was a night elf hunter who ran out of arrows around level eight and melee'd my way ever since. I got kicked out of the only Deadmines run I somehow got involved with as I needed on every single green I came across (This was my first MMO and the whole roll system was new to me). So yeah, pretty bad.
---
I say that WOTLK was the perfect balance of offering both casual and hardcore content.  After this it went too casual 
---
That garbage bag is way too nice to be BfA.
---
Then you have a vanilla character with however much money you didn't decide to copy.
---
Items are an issue as you could then dupe any non-bound item.
---
49 was dead on every pserver I've been on
---
*/g Anyone still need to do their daily random heroic?*
---
WotLK was a major turning point. IMO it was the first time all content besides raid progression became a roflstomp DPS race.
---
Many times its work smarter not harder. 
---
When i played vanilla i was a software architect for an investment bank. 
---
Now, it's the same deal just a different firm, but upgraded technology.   Pretty much doing what blizzard went through. But ill be super casual this time around.  No time. Family etc. 
---
look on private servers, ive seen people do commissions there 
---
As a hunter I used to shoot rats in dungeons to fool my party members that I ninja pulled. Only they were the feet of elites, bodies hidden by objects. I did this twice in one dungeon and when I tried to explain myself my space bar didn't work. It came out like ohgodimsorryitwasntonpurposeiwasjoking:((((
---
This sub really turned into /r/fuckretailwow
---
WotLK was a major turning point. It was the first time in the history of WoW that all content besides raid progression became a roflstomp DPS race, which continues to this day. The are only three classes now: tank, healer and DPS. If a couple people are aware of a CC mechanic, you can make it through most of H Uldir facesmashing the keyboard. Ever take an alt into a mythic Taloc pug that wipes in the elevator twice then disbands? Some of these people have made it to the absolute highest level of end-game PvE content and still can't deal with "avoid the lasers".
---
I leveled as dual-wield Arms on my first character. I was not a smart teenager.
---
For me, I feel like it was mid WotLK where things went south. Class identity was vanishing quickly, dungeons in general were stupid easy. And being able to just que up for one, instead of engaging with people to form a group hurt the game almost as much as arenas.
---
 All through (the last 6 months) vanilla and TBC, I worked hard as a tank, to earn a good reputation in my community! There were times I even passed up loot and let someone else take it, because I knew as a tank it was easier for me to find a group, than say a ret pally, or dps warrior. So when I logged on, I got shit loads of whispers asking me to tank stuff for them. A lot of those were from strangers! I got to know some amazing people!....and some ass hats too. 
---
Then in wrath, that quickly went away. With lfd, it seemed like no one talked to each other anymore. Except guildies. And by the end of LK, I could log on every day for a week, and not meet a single new person. And over the classes all becoming re-skins of the same thing, raids and dungeons getting stupid easy, and pvp battlegrounds just becoming several different types of zerg rushing, it was the community break that killed it for me. 
---
The only reason I finished WotLK was because of the story. I wanted to see how it ended. But once I did, once I killed the LK himself, I quit the game. 
---
I always enjoyed seeing all the other Hunters running around our class hall, which is of course the area from the Purple exit to the Portal entrance of Maraudon.
---
WOTLK is shit compared to Classic.
---
My Orc Hunter spent all his gold on shitty blue BOE swords from the AH, and didn't have autoshot on my bars. I exclusively engaged combat with serpent sting or arcane shot. If either of those spells were on cooldown, I waited.
---
Depends on the class. Locks could lead dmg in some garbage crafted blues in TBC, even later on. TBC had a better progression though and I would totally agree there. You actually had to do things to get to the next step. I would never do it again and we were exhausted by the end of TBC, especially with all the respeccing, Arenas and no dual spec.   
---
It was fun once. It was fun when I didn't know the raids and we had to figure stuff out and when we were trying to screw eachother out of warglaves (never again). TBC was just bad imo. Most people are going to hate it if they ever do it again and I don't even think they will get people to even get pre raid stuff in Heroic before population nosedives. Look at what happened when they tried to do it again in Cata (5 mans being hard). Vanilla? Still holds up. Casuals can raid. Hardcores can get ahead and the leveling is fun. Things are just timegated. Even Naxx is just timegated. That time becomes obscene though in Naxx, which is why it will still be rare to see people clear it.
---
Okay, looking back we're both wrong.
---
This is the context:
---
In the demo this happened https://clips.twitch.tv/GloriousAmorphousDoveCopyThis, Blizzard looked at the report and said it looks like a bug, they checked and it wasn't. To be even clearer, using Charge while having Bloodrage up is still a bug, but the neutral mob not attacking you isn't a bug. The person using charge IS put into combat.
---
The reason in my eyes that "neutral mob" was specified was not because they were neutral but because they won't aggro you by proximity (ie. "only the offensive momentum actually triggers the fight"). In other words, by charging a hostile mob and not attacking it, the mob is going to aggro onto you anyways because you're in range of it. For this reason I thought it was reasonable to extrapolate this to PvP, where combat is determined strictly by abilities and not proximity. In fact I still believe this to be the case. However, I am still wrong because the debate isn't related to the user of the charge being put into combat just the target of the charge, you too were wrong about this (this is what that translation comment is saying as well)
---
I'm wrong on one front, but I'm still not sure about the other. However we should be able to test this come a beta/release. If a warrior charges a rogue in PvP, and the warrior never autos him can the rogue stealth after the stun? If he can't this really is hyper specific to neutral mobs for some reason.
---
this is so wrong, forge of souls and halls of reflection were noob detecting machines. i distinctly remember seeing many people get kicked from these groups if they weren’t coordinated... plus people were doing achievement runs back then which meant you had to communicate as five and be a competent player. no one that’s actually played wrath would say they didn’t have good memories in ulduar or icc, because both those raids were great. they had some simple dps check fights but there were plenty of hard times too, it’s not like the entire xpack was a cake walk, even the world was still hard. the game didn’t start to simplify itself hard until cataclysm, no talents, cross realm everything at this point, introduction of looking for raid, class ability/spell tuneups, the world was changed (physically and difficulty)
---
You have to take in account the options classic players have compared to retail. Every class has a movement a heal a cc and an interrupt. In classic those things were called niches. And therefore made simple mechanics like adds, hard if tuned in a way. 
---
I’d still say that vanilla is harder with the context of the classes at the time. If you were to throw retail classes in classic, it would be a faceroll. Just look at the time walking MC raid. People ignore mechanics because everyone can do everything.
---
Yup
---
I didn't know how you were supposed to move, tbh. So people would diss me years later when I was on a pserver because I was so slow. I was turning with WASD and clicking the buttons instead of using hotkeys.
---
I was playing runescape before wow (about 11 years old I think). So I thought that grinding mobs was the best way to level, basically didn't quest at all, save for class quests on my warrior. Played that way for almost 2 years, grinding mobs with cheap low level food. I also ran a lot of dungeons and would take easily 2 hours each one. Was only level 50 something when TBC came out.
---
Nah WOTLK was casual and shit. 
---
In tbc I usually raided, but I preferred using the hunter arena season 1 gear over tier 4 because it looked better.. 
---
The only advantage of a private sever player compared to someone who isn’t one of those people, is Pvp knowledge. Inherently players who have played classic for 10 years know how to Pvp really well. This will show in bgs and in world Pvp. People would be able to catch up in a couple of years, but you have guys who theorycrafted a perfect WSG permade and what happens when rogue uses X to stop the FC from doing Y.
---
&gt;Arena was a mistake
---
:( This was my favorite part of wow BY FAR. I always thought they didnt do it quite right, but once TBC came out and until I quit playing toward the end of WotLK all I did was arena. PvE was always super boring for me. But 2v2 arena kept me playing for years. I leveled like 6 different alts just for the challenge of getting 2k+ with every class. It is the sole element I will miss when playing classic. 
---
MOP had the best Arena by far. I wish Blizzard would just do WOTLK/CATA/MOP seasons or just MOP in their most balanced patches. Just make it like a Tourney private server and make it F2P. Give people the stupidest looking gear ever and let them transmog from the retail game if they have a sub or pay MT's for outfits. WoW would instantly be 1000 times better as an esport, they would get many new players and they could separate Arena from the main game so they could make WoW good again as a MMO.
---
I stopped caring about raiding in Cata. Skillgating things and different raid design caused a lot of fun people to quit and also was the start of more hardcore guilds that just weren't fun to play in. To progress I had to leave people I had played with for years. It was just dumb. I do think they should have content for hardcore like the Mage Tower or Challenge Runs, but it should have never hit raiding. No one will ever say they quit WoW because they weren't good enough to raid anymore, but it's one reason population fell off a cliff. 
---
The best raiding guild tank in the world at the time quit as well and said raiding was a curse. I thin Kungen is 100 percent right about everything.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MNFWhCw8dg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MNFWhCw8dg)
---
I keep in bank the shards I made by killing my mind controlled guildies.
---
Yeah wotlk was when game turned garbage
---
I thought u couldn't do it during vanilla, i guess i was wrong tho :p 
---
Just didn't want it changed but if u actually could do it it's fine :)
---
Yeah see my content on what I think they should do with Arena with the tourney realms. I only played Arena mainly from Cata until Legion and stopped raiding completely. The classes are just bad past WoD though.
---
If they had a MOP tourney realm I would instantly sub back to WoW. Sub Rogue was soooooo fun back when the class had complexity. You can say the same for most classes. WoD just destroyed everything.
---
Yeah I hear people say this a lot.  And I agree to an extent.  I think that the addition to stuff like xrealm bgs started a trend of adding new and cool stuff that eventually killed wow but I don’t think that system itself killed it.  I think if they kept WoW the way wotlk was it would have been fine. 
---
Well locks were the PvE flavor of the expansion for TBC, so hard to use them as a metric.  Again, agree with everything except:
---
&gt; TBC had a better progression
---
I disliked TBC's linear "gear from every raid is across the board better than the previous raid" progression.
---
The only high points for me about TBC were Kara and hybrid viability in end-game PvE.
---
PS Realized I originally meant to respond to you but responded to Likesgames instead.
---
This is one of the most disgusting things I have ever read.
---
In before people who never got out of Kara who mainly enjoyed Vanilla leveling in TBC tell me how amazing TBC was (even though they claim to have done Sunwell(). Or people that only raided in WOTLK and think that the game was always that limited and a collection of instanced mini games.
---
That's fair about the raids/later expac achievements being difficult. I honestly didn't raid in LK because I was so disgusted by the leveling experience that I quit a few months in. My server was also experiencing serious brain drain because all the better guilds had moved onto greener pastures, so between that and the cross-realm bullshit and the phasing, the world looked empty and the community aspect was absolutely dead. Might have been different on a higher-pop server.
---
they were different times back then man.  You just heard about this 'world of warcraft' game, that it was a huge world to explore and so many quests to do.. you just jumped on a server and started playing.  There wasn't a huge wealth of information and most people didn't even know to look for what was available.  It took most people well over 6 months to even hit max level on a single character... so much to do and explore, trying out other classes..  The game wasn't streamlined, there wasn't a huge amount of information available, people were still figuring it out, plenty of people in this thread were very young kids... there's a lot of reasons why this happened but really it was just a more innocent age of gaming.
---
Druid?
---
You actually contradict yourself in this comment.
---
&gt; "This means that unless you take an action that causes the mob to aggro you (eg. auto-attack them), you will immediately drop combat."
---
&gt; "I have a suspicion that the demo actually worked exactly as it was supposed to in this regard."
---
Looking at that [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/GloriousAmorphousDoveCopyThis) again the warrior is very clearly in combat after the charge. Either "you will immediately drop combat" is wrong, or the demo was wrong because the warrior was still in combat after the charge.
---
Booty Bay rogue's trainer!!!
---
I admit it...I clicked.
---
Post raid finder is where it really started to go down hill. Absolutely destroyed the pug scene making it impossible for casuals to even join normals because they have such high requirements. And the groups with lower requirements are absolute trash because the members are so inexperienced.
---
Has to be Moonglade. Loved that zone since first seeing it as a lvl 10 druid, just so peaceful and beautiful.
---
Because gnomes are awesome
---
I don't think you know what the difference between objective fact and opinion is.
---
Tbc was legendary. 
---
I never got out of kara, and really loved TBC.
---
I'll certainly wait till after it comes out so we know what software we are working with.
---
Not nostalrius and im sold. 
---
I agree wholeheartedly 
---
For me it was the Sunwell patch in BC. Achievements have no place in WoW. It’s when it started to become a collecting game.
---
Sunwell was also a dull raid. And the epics you could but there were too good.
---
M Night Shyamalan's Avatar: The Last Aribender is the pinnacle of cinema.
---
Everyone will have their own final straw.
---
For me WoW died at Trials of the Crusader.
---
I think that's because he uses Bloodrage.
---
Bloodrage was bugged, that's why he could charge with it up in the first place.
---
EXCELLENT VIDEO!!!  I’m an English teacher who loves WoW, so I love the analysis and dissection of the music score to create meaning for our upcoming journey. 
---
I’m also learning how to play piano— so it’s really fun to see all the notes you put on the screen. 
---
Grizzly hills next? 
---
If you want to be real, there's 2 tragedies that occurred in to this game starting in Wrath that led to the downfall.  
---
1. Gearscore: No need for explanation. This addon started it all. 
---
2. Sharding/Phasing: Everyone basically turned into a rogue. Vanish out of thin air walking into anywhere. 
---
I honestly have to say WotLK gets way more praise in hindsight than I figured it would. The dungeons and raids were extremely easy. 
---
The biggest complaint early on in Cataclysm was that the dungeons were too difficult (because people got used to facerolling in wrath). 
---
I used arrow keys to move and clicked my spells. When I mounted, I changed positions of my hands, so my right hand was on arrow keys and left one on Spacebar.
---
You know, so I could jump while riding. Only learned how to use WASD once I started playing Minecraft and there was no other way to move.
---
You just have to go through the timbermaw hold. Which is easy if you get to unfriendly with them.
---
Or just naked corpse run it. Once you get the Moonglade FP you'll never have to do it again.
---
This illustrates how subjective it is, the point where one feels like WoW lost its way. Personally, WotLK had great zones, but I also remember hitting level cap and then being immediately summoned to Naxx 10 by the other 9 level cap players in my guild. It shouldn’t have been that easy to start raiding, but it was. That, to me, was a big indicator that things were too casual. 
---
WHAT?
---
Hi, I'm 13/18/20 paladin. One loot please.
---
Left handed, didn't pay attention in elementary school, and grew up with the PC. Hope that helps.
---
But then you're just reducing their effectiveness. Might as well take a priest or a dps instead if your druids are going to stand there and do nothing half the time. In a real raid you might bring 4 because you have 4, and it'll be fine, but it's not really ideal. 
---
You cannot and have never been able to trade enchanted items with the 2 hr loot trade. If you enchant an item it becomes NON TRADEABLE.
---
Stop posting lies about loot trading to rile people up.
---
Never quested until level 50ish because quests were confusing 
---
That's nothing new. You could always enchant low level items with high level enchants.
---
Well, I used to prioritize Spirit on my casters so I didn't have to drink as much, so you tell me.
---
WotL was garbage too lol. Naxx was recycled... and every server cleared it in the first week. Litterally ran out of things to do in less than 2 weeks. So easy I got board and quit for good. Classic is my only hope now.
---
10 years later and I'm still heartbroken that his TBC video got lost on a harddrive
---
Is Kungen gonna play Classic?
---
Ulduar had heroic too. But they were done in a very different way. I loved how it was handled in ulduar, much more fun and immersive.
---
I leveled as Arcane Mage up to level 45 or so. Constantly OOM. Groups hated me. And I didn't even take Improved Arcane Explosion, which was the only reason any sane person would go into Arcane in early versions. O\_O
---
I'd rather watch flashy overediting than Saerdna 3 which was recorded at 11 fps 
---
I used to watch ashens for this sort of thing.
---
TBC onwards sucked
---
Yes, in Ulduar they were kinda optional. When they added heroic they made ir part of the progression and forced you to progress through the same raid multiple times since now 10m heroic was now also important all of a sudden. And its only gotten worse since then. 
---
TBC was good, but had bad ideas like flying. imo the original trilogy is WoW and the only things i would change are, keep it simple and only have normal mode, heroic TBC dungeons are great and that i would keep but for wrath raids i would only have normal 25 man as a option. I would also bring attunements into wrath as wrath lacked those, i would also keep achievements to general achievs and remove all achievements related to raids and i would also remove the ability to use a addon like gearscore. And i would minimize the amount of dailies and make some of them more rewarding (and harder) normal quests. 
---
Now, what would be interesting is if we removed flying from outlands and northrend, it would also be interesting if we never implement cross realm BG's and never put in LFG at the end of Wrath.
---
:/
---
Yeah, and its a shame too as the dungeons in early Cata were just AMAZING. Not nearly as hard as TBC dungeons but man, that is how dungeons in WoW should be handled imo.
---
I won't lie, I really really think WOTLK is an amazing game. Great content and a perfect balance between casual and hardcore with nearly all of the vanilla and TBC quests available for that craving of nostalgia (or at least part of it) and the ability to freeze your level.
---
It felt even better due to Druids being the most unpopular class at the time, almost like you had your own little club you shared with the other faction. I always loved how peaceful the zone was, not a single hostile mob in sight. I used to explore every nook and cranny.
---
And then the Lunar Festival came around and I discovered the hard way there can indeed be one hostile mob in the zone. 
---
Only shame is the cost of training being higher than going to your capital. Though for Night Elves it's amended by Moonglade being conveniently close to Teldrassil, so even if I don't train in Moonglade I always stop by on the way to Darnassus. Helps that there's no trainer in Ironforge, so unless you're close to Stormwind you always went to the good ol' tree. 
---
And that felt nice too. Being a Druid meant you got to visit your home more than any other class, cept' mages who took a liking to the city. 
---
Oh I am not sure if this is bad or admirable thb. But Ive played priest and since I didnt know how raiding worked I only played 5 mans. I really liked the Warlock T0 and since I never understod what spirit is for, I prefered to get it over the priest T0.
---
The admirable part is, that over the year I actually got it, with the head piece being the last one I obtained :)
---
Played a shaman, was 12, made it to 60 and raised with brain hacker because it was my only epic. Couldn't understand why everyone always told me to stop using flame shock, constantly oom, just a terrible player but had so much fucking fun and actually could excel in the hybrid playstyle during 5 and 10 mans.
---
Easily the best Addon so far! I felt so mighty getting my t9 from TOC 10 man (I was a noob and it felt like a huge victory to me) after that I found a guild that took me as their main fury Warrior for 10 man ICC runs (we never got Arthas prenerf but it was still so rewarding to kill all wings as a „casual“ guild) 
---
Oh well, looks like I’ve joined you.  Lol.
---
Wotlk dungeons were too easy and were essentially loot hallways. There were no attunements, and zone quests were sharded. Naxx 10/25 were too easy compared to the prior tier of content. Our raiding guild jumped in to Naxx 25 still in T6 and hardly any quest upgrades and got the no deTh achievement after about 3 or 4 Naxx 25 clears. Wotlk was not only too casual, it introduced LFD which paved the way for the causal slogfest that became LFR in Cata. Cata is often called out as being the expansion that killed wow's community, but I'd argue it was actually WotLK. Cata was the eventual result of the changes implemented in WotLK. Had they not had LFD, sharding of lore quests, more complicated dungeons, and raid attunements WotLK would have been much better. The ICC &amp; Ulduar lore, zone questing and storytelling were all great. But there was a lost sense of community in WotLK.
---
Wrath introduced the underlying mechanics and mentality that eventually fostered and diverted the game into what it is today gameplay wise. Wrath’s story, lore and questing, however, were just as solid as BFA. 
---
think ur aim should be to calm down and just enjoy the goddamn game. with your overthinking and overanalyzing you would ruin even the greatest experience. 
---
I was quite good, I played Quake prior to WoW so it was easy in compiaron.
---
I was voted the best PvP Druid on the server by a few people, which is nice.
---
I only remember the Druid and Warlock, but seems they're quite popular.
---
Druids obviously had Moonglade. While not the place you trained skills, it was a convenient hub, especially for Alliance. Great for getting to Kalimdor and then taking a free flight to Darnassus to train your skills. Not to mention you get an entire zone to yourself. Unless it's the Lunar Festival it's just fellow druids there. Not even any hostile mobs. Super chill. Should mention Darnassus too. I loved going to that tree every time, making sure to visit Bearmantle in the middle since he was the "main" druid, listening to Fandral being an ass, and then on the way back throwing longing sights at the sabers, waiting to buy one of your own. 
---
Warlocks on the other hand found the darkest nooks and crannies to do their business. I loved how you had to go into basements and crypts to find your trainers engrossed in dark rituals. Really sold the feeling you were dealing with darker powers. And while it's not a zone, that bar basement in Stormwind is pretty damn big.
---
The only reason not to play a mage is if you are tired of playing a mage. They are top tier. 
---
Execute moves are what get you on the killing blow list. It's shodowburn for locks and execute for warriors. I don't remember another class having an execute style attack but i could be wrong. Any class with an instant burst style dmg attack should be able to do it though.
---
Hunters in AV can go out 100+/0 if they play accordingly
---
Are warriors dependant on a healer to stay alive
---
I know what the game was like! I mained mage and regularly topped the dps charts in raids. 
---
When I went for rank 11 (lt general) back in the day I was still in school. For the last couple of weeks I had no life outside of WoW - I did the minimum required things at school, went home and farmed honour late into the night. I remember that I felt like puking the last week due to the amount of honour farming I did, it was crazy hard even though I was on a medium populated server and I was doing it with 2 friends that each went on to become a lt general and a warlord (and we were good together, when TBC came around we made a good team in the arena and got our weapons in season 1 before quitting that kind of pvp since we thought it was boring).   
---
I actually talked with my brother about the pvp ranks today, and he just laughed and said that he'd never be able to become a commander again, we don't have enough time to dedicate to it pve is the way to go.
---
I love that tower. It's such a random place and very easy to miss. Just a couple warlocks doing their business in the middle of freaking nowhere. And then further down barrens there's a warlock that gives out a warlock-exclusive quest that nets you a weapon. Just randomly. In The Barrens. In some ruined camp. 
---
Leveling to 60 isn’t a grind of killing boars, for 10 hours a day, but I’m not going to spoil the journey for you.
---
Paladins had hammer of wrath, no? 
---
What’s the glitch? How do you work around the problem?
---
Pretty sure you’re just wrong. So please cite a current source. 
---
This is why I like classic, idiots like that hunter get blacklisted
---
Good post until that weird passive aggressive last line lol
---
Well it’s going to be very hard to open world AoE farm for Classic launch considering the volume of people. Mages are much slower than other options for 1-60 but  they’re certainly not the slowest, even without AoE options.
---
Oh and how can I forget, the freaking Shaman stones. They're not exactly hubs per se, but I loved how there were little hidden locations that you'd normally never discover unless you were a Shaman. 
---
One of the things the Draenei got right, all their locations are on Azuremyst and Bloodmyst and it's a treat finding those. Especially the wind one. 
---
Depends on the situation but mostly yes. The thing is all classes are gonna need a healer to do reasonably well in PVP or WPVP
---
On my mage, I used to fire blast low-health enemies in BG’s. Not the most optimal, but I got killing blows 50% of the times, lol 
---
* Great solo pvp
---
* Great group pvp
---
* Great levelling, even without aoe grinding
---
* Easily the best 5 man dps class
---
* Teleports save you literally hours of travel time 
---
*String dps raiding from T1 through to end game
---
Warriors seem to get mentioned everytime with needing a healer always though.
---
For most killing blows I would say a Warlock that just dots up everybody.
---
For 1v1 I would say a mace spec stun lock undead rogue. They are annoying as heck unless you are a prot paladin with retribution aura.
---
I rolled a Dwarf Hunter mostly because of the boost to guns. 
---
I remember seeing the mechanostriders next to the engineering trainer near Kharanos and figured I would be able to construct them.
---
Professions and exploration became my shit, I crafted a gnomish death ray in my 30s &amp; it was my go to for PvP because I was terrible.
---
I never got to 60 by myself, my Hunter ended up level 42 with about 32 days played time running around mining, leveled a troll shaman to 53 and then was given a few BWL geared characters from an older friend who had burned out.
---
Never learned to play until WotLK, I rolled a DK when they were overtuned, joined a very casual raiding guild and topped the charts spamming Howling Blast.
---
Admittedly I liked the attention and wanted to improve, found the elitist jerks board and raiding logs.
---
Are rogues able to top BGs?
---
Take all of my upvote. 
---
Kungen is without a doubt a true WoW dinosaur. His words have a meaning, at least to me.
---
Although his artistic qualities can be considered BFA quality, he is a nice guy who has done a lot for the game.
---
Lately he had some health issues and I really miss him a lot on twitch. Let‘s hope his light will shine again someday in the World of Warcraft.
---
&gt; Well seeing you thought WoD Sub Rogue was good I can safely say you are a bad rogue and I have forgotten more about the class than you will ever learn. WoD was when rogue became accessible to people like you in PvP due to being redesigned by a guy who played on a stencil tablet (Celestalon).
---
I'm going to stop you right there. I have mained Rogue since 2004 and my arena rating in WoD was no higher than it's always been. Since TBC I've always been a washed up 1x Glad many times Duelist rat.
---
I acknowledged that WoD Rogue was worse than previous designs. At least it still felt like a Rogue. I've always had fun playing Rogue until Legion.
---
Anyway, have a seat. I am not your enemy here.
---
Achievements were a Wrath feature so they were only in BC during prepatch.
---
ACTUALLY lol'd 😂👍
---
He makes a good point, but it only applied to the best of the best. Very good guilds clear mythic content in 3 weeks and get BiS in another month or so. 
---
But average to good guilds? They take months to clear the content. It's true that raiding has become a huge part of the game, but it seems to me like it always was. He even says it himself, in vanilla, he would raid hours a day, and when he was done raiding, he was farming mats *for the raids*. 
---
In my opinion, wow feels empty now because catch up mechanics have gotten out of hand. The only content that's relevant is not only the current expansion's content, but the current *patch's* content. People barely run the first tier of content when the second one is out. That wasn't true in vanilla and TBC because of the lack of catch up mechanics. If you wanted to run Naxx, you'd need to run MC to gear up for BWL and then run BWL to gear up for AQ and then run AQ to gear up for Naxx. ZG and AQ20 helped, but it never made the old raids obsolete. 
---
But to the hardcore raider, it's true that their playtime becomes very limited, and vanilla increased it because of consumable farm. The best pserver guilds atm spend very little time raiding, which matches his experience on WOD, raiding only 3 hours a week to clear the content. People needed a bit more for consumables and gear as it was less plentiful back then, but again, this helps the top of the top play for longer, but hurts the middle of the pack that doesn't clear content within a few weeks of release. It's a balance to strike, and while he makes some good points, he completely ignores the average player's experience, which blizzard has to take into account. 
---
Definitely. It does get a pass from people because of it having the best story/narrative, arguably the greatest raid in Ulduar.
---
Maybe if they can camp a graveyard.
---
Before I ever got the game myself, I played on a friend's account he let me play his low level warlock. She was a human around level 12 in westfall. It was so much fun.
---
After going to there house and grinding the warlock to about 17, I got a group for deadmines. And it was amazing! That's all I wanted to do. Not instinces, just deadmines. I grouped over and over for it. By the time I got my own copy, the loc was level 27 with the most random gear. But she was so high level only the last boss gave xp, and it was less than 100xp at that.
---
Enchanting BoEs does not bind the item to you. This isn't a glitch and is irrelevant to loot trading, which concerns only BoP items. 
---
In serious PvP rogues defend flags (both AB and WSG) a majority of the time or are stealth capping bases in AB. Which isn't particularly good for getting killing blows. In pugs you might be able to do okay with daggers but I imagine a hunter/warrior/mage/warlock would be much more effective.
---
one of the best dps end game  
---
good lvling  
---
some really damn good utilities and some really good ways to make quick bucks  
---
but sure useless class i mean 
---
\^this
---
The end of wrath was the end of my wow journey also. Fond memories up until cataclysm. I did read a post about an employee at blizzard during this time that mentioned it was about half way through wrath that Activision got it's claws into the company and implemented it's changes. It definitely reflected on the content and service provided. I remember there was a time I could call blizzard and speak to a real employee on the phone. By the end of wrath it was all online.
---
&gt;Everything past Vanilla is bad.
---
He literally says tbc and wotlk were awesome. Did you even watch the video?
---
God that raid was so unexciting from top to bottom. 
---
Loot was ugly and sucked.
---
Encounters were boring as hell.
---
Whole thing took place in 2 rooms. As a MT I hated logging on for ToC nights 
---
I think that it was stated that  /sitting was not going to proc talents?  Honestly a lot of things depend on how many players in total are from private servers.  If private server players are 1% or less of the total players then they will hardly be noticeable besides forum posts claiming server firsts.  From everything I have heard they would not have much of an advantage in PvP besides the slight gear advantage from leveling faster (just as any hardcore player who no-lifes it) and being slightly more familiar with their class ahead of time.  Besides druid power shifting, fury warriors being OP, and grabbing every world buff possible what other raiding meta's have changed?  I imagine healing is still down ranking appropriately and mages/warlocks spam one spell over and over(slightly simplified)?  I imagine the most successful people will be those who data mine classic the fastest and redevelop the meta for the correct values that blizzard gives (which again is probably something private server people would do).  So yeah private server players will have an advantage but if you play as much and are just as dedicated you would probably "catch up" before BWL bucket is even released.
---
Oh I agree, but the level on competence of the average player in retail is SIGNIFICANTLY higher.
---
The most efficient way to level is with frost AOE farming yeah but you can quest the old fashion way and do fine. Also I dont think playing a mage is boring at all. Pyroblast is a really fun opener in my opinion. They are half death as soon as you pull them. Lol!
---
Wrath of the Lich King was the highest peak for WoW.
---
Oh yeah I loved the early Cata dungeons, talking dungeon strats in guild chart for first time in years!
---
I clicked instead of keybinds until approximately Chrom/Nefarian in BWL, and I used max rank flash heal almost all of the time, so yeah, I was bad.
---
Hi, /u/sullski
---
if vanilla had proper balance/viability and decent pve gameplay, sure  
---
Hmmm...
---
Yep, there'll still be plenty of shittalk. Just follow the usual rule of "don't be a c*nt" and everybody will have fun.
---
I never saw Sunwell, and the only tier I cleared when it was current content was Kara/Gruul/Magtheridon. TBC is amazing. Fight me.
---
I want to raid at 60. Never actually raised in Vanilla, since I'm a PvP guy. 
---
Second goal is to have 2 twinks of each faction. Especially a gnome warlock, to just dot up everyone as I die and watch them all die with me. 
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Kungen is an odd one. His main problem with the game is that it became too difficult and he couldn't stay relevant anymore. He tried mythic raiding in WOD and failed miserably.
---
He may talk a lot about how the game was better in the past but it comes from a very selfish place and not because he actually preferred the design philosophies of the past. 
---
You can skin in forms in vanilla
---
ele shaman.
---
I'm not sure there is a class that doesn't have repetitive rotations for raiding. Once mages get past bwl ignite rolling is fun and I don't think there is really a mechanic like that anywhere else. Even in Frost spec you can take engineering and do other things to push meters. 
---
And he's only 2........then everyone clapped.
---
Yes but it has a cast, a travel time, and a cooldown.
---
For sniping KBs, Id say Mage and Hunter. Hunter simply because theyre far back and have free reign to pick targets, as well Cheetah. Mage because you can blink in and Fire Blast and AE to finish people off.
---
Shadowburn is good, but Warlocks lack the mobility to opportunistically snipe kills. Warriors have the same problem that they cant really snipe killing blows, just fight the people in melee, if someone is running away from you, a ranged is usually going to steal the killing blow from you in a group.
---
Pretty much every class is pretty good 1v1 PvP except Druids, Holy priests and some PvE specs.
---
&gt; Why should this be stopped? The whole point with vanilla is that the babywheels come off and you can do and invest as much as you want into what you find the most fun. People don't start twinking because it's balanced and fair, they do it because they want to run around and destroy players who barely understand what's going on.
---
You said it yourself. It should be stopped because it's just a way for jerks and losers to destroy players who barely understand what's going on.
---
And before you start in with the usual apologia, nobody wants perfect balance in PvP any more than we want every single boxing match to be a 50/50 proposition.  But if someone finds a loophole that lets them smuggle a 130kg fighter into a 50kg division that ought to be shut down because that degree of imbalance breaks the game.
---
My first character's (NElf hunter) main weapon was a fishing rod because it has higher damage values than my weapon before it. I sold my bow because it has less damage than my melee weapons.
---
Early Cata dungeons before people got geared and before they got nerfed were actually fun, T11 was also pretty decent pre nerf
---
Damn man. That was a long time ago, crazy to think about.
---
Anyway I often flip flop. Sometimes, my favorite version of WoW was vanilla, sometimes tbc and sometimes wotlk.
---
Wotlk has a special place in my heart, the dungeons especially, and my from then on until I quit main, death knight. Sadly wotlk also brought in a lot of the "features" that killed wow, easier quests, enemies, reputation and of course group finder. Wotlk was, at the same time, peak wow and the beginning of the end. Everything after group finder was total garbage.
---
But in any case, the game is indeed total trash now, and it'll be great to play classic. Let's hope blizzard takes out the trash.
---
Hi, /u/BetaLess
---
He says the raiding was good in TBC. He says the community was dead. MMO's are about community. He also says that "raiding is a curse" and that since the game was focused around raiding it's bad. I suggest you watch the video.
---
"Do you want sharding? Because that's how you get sharding" - blizzard

Of course it wont. Big Brother is watching you. Barrens chat, world chat, are all not going to be the same... They will ban you for saying anything, griefing and all included...

All classes are viable. All classes have to respec between PVE and PVP. Heal hybrids should be offhealing in PVP. IF you don't want to learn how to heal then you should be playing a pure. Now have fun CC'ing, which you also won't do, which is why no one should have catered to you in the first place.
---
Nobody knows that these mages are gathered here, summoning demons, trading dark secrets.
---
In I ride to learn from the great Sandahl.
---
:)
---
The mages had their tower with portals and it was all bright and knowledge-y. Our basement, just up the block, in the basement of The Slaughtered Lamb, felt truly RP-like.
---
There isn't really anything more fun then ganking in Stormwind/Ironforge as a Horde Rogue... the feels.
---
To be totally honest from a technical standpoint BFA is better in every way, but technical achievement doesn’t make a game great. 
---
WOTLK was Awesome, but it sewed the seeds of WoWs destruction. It had convenience without lack of community and  the classes were mostly balanced and viable while remaining distinct and unique. The story telling was much more improved, and  it didn’t seem as if they were  trying to ram you through content.   If they just wouldn’t have continued down that path, if they could hit the brakes a little. things wouldn’t have come to this point 
---
I was a warrior too, mostly OT in raids had a few epics. I was not very good and didn’t understand most of the mechanics. I just remember my Internet was so bad id dc from mc raids and people would be pissed
---
My wife’s first character on retail was a hunter, and she really enjoyed it. However, despite that being her main since end of Cata/beginning of MoP, she has found that she prefers playing a resto shaman. She created a shaman to play casually on a pserver as well, and will most likely do the same when Classic drops. Of course it is all up to personal play style and what role she would feel more comfortable being in.
---
Vanilla was the hay day of Roguelyfe.  Back when PvP fights were quick and the element of surprise in world pvp..
---
you won't regret being a rogue in vanilla
---
&gt;  Honestly a lot of things depend on how many players in total are from  private servers.  If private server players are 1% or less of the total  players then they will hardly be noticeable 
---
Playerbase will always opt to follow trends produced by the top 1% and those trends will become the meta.
---
Cata talent changes were the best imo. The old talent system flaw was most apparent in wotlk where so many talents were “mandatory” that there really was no choice. Pruning them back to 31 was good for the illusion of choice people clamor for.
---
Yup my internet use to dc me all the time during raids, I was an OT warrior lol
---
Doing what?  Knowing a few people in your guild with a server community that was dead? Or was it leveling in Vanilla content which has nothing to do with TBC? Or was it running around a pole in a horrible esport in the 2's bracket, because no one bothered with the 3's bracket until Blizzard forced them to play it, because they admitted any balance in 2's was impossible. Or was it doing dailies like a zombie because the game was no longer a real MMO and they needed content for idiots?
---
Mouse-over description says that Spirit affected mana regeneration.
---
I stacked, "... of the Owl"-gear on my Warlock, so downtime drinking went faster. I had no idea how to drain-tap-aoe grind on my first playthrough. Plus it was on a PvP server, so the idea of lifetap just seemed stupid to me. I needed high passive regen to have less downtime...
---
It's not though.
---
Nice meme  
---
game is based around pve content (didnt even have battlegrounds at start)  
---
if class/spec isnt viable for main content, then its not viable for main content  
---
If this isn't in the game, can we get a Cap v2.0 that DOES do this? PLEASE!? So cool!
---
I leveled a rogue to level 49 choosing my gear based on armor value. 
---
You can also do Strat Live round robin orb runs, given tank and healer the first two orbs, rest of the orbs to dps.  
---
You can do these on repeat fairly easy. Build up a large inventory of DPS who want to do these runs and you can always have a Strat Live farming run any time you want, and since you're the tank and healer, you can control when they start or stop.  
---
Raiding wasn't even planned as a content until way later one the developpement of wow.
---
Most people weren't even raiding. Raiding only became a focus later.
---
It's actually sad that people that were 1000 times worse act elitist about raiding and think raiding is what makes a MMO good. The best tank (and if you weren't a tank you were nothing, because they are all that mattered in the first two expansions) on the best guild for 3 expansions is telling you Blizzard's obsession with raiding (Ion ran elitst jerks even though all he did was press chainheal) breaks the game, even though his main income was from raiding. Meanwhile unethical people who put money before a game being good, sit there and prop up raiding and mythics to protect their income and Ion is delusional enough to think people only started playing WoW to raid as a esport...as if anyone will ever care about that.
---
&gt;I suggest you watch the video.
---
Sure thing. In fact, that's how I quoted it.
---
https://youtu.be/9MNFWhCw8dg?t=349
---
He states that TBC and WOTLK were awesome but flawed. Far cry from "bad."
---
They’re really useful for solo ninja capping towers in Av as well. They can deal decent burst damage is cat mode, but not rogue levels. They’re fun for messing around in world pvp. 
---
They’re good 1v1 since they can disengage and re engage when they want, it may not be the quickest kill but they can control the fight really well. I think they excel in a more support based role in group pvp. I’ve heard balance can do decent burst as well but it’s a bitch to gear. 
---
I need to connect with these people when Classic launches. I'm willing to pay for addons that I want.  
---
&gt;Raiding wasn't even planned as a content until way later one the developpement of wow 
---
Completely irrelevant. PVE/raiding was the main part of the game since its launch.  
---
&gt;Most people weren't even raiding. Raiding only became a focus later.  
---
because most people were bad and leveling took very long  
---
kind reminder that wow was the most casual mmo when it came out, which is why it got popular  
---
I do, many  comprehensive pros and cons lists for this particular subject have been created. Cons win every time. That's the data, and it dictates fact until proven false. Which it won't, because for every 1 instance of loot trading where a bop item was accidentally assigned to the wrong person or other positive scenarios, there will be 100 instances of groups of douchebags outrolling a pug - loot bullying, people secretly trading for gold, ninja looters holding loot hostage etc.  
---
Noone of sound mind and body will argue in favor of the loot trading system. It's a trash system for trash people.
---
I'm actually in a less popular camp, where I want the technical complexity, fluidity and beauty of BFA combined with the game-design and spirit of Classic.
---
I hope they do continue developing Classic in a new direction, with the same mindset. No convenience improvements. No vertical design. Keep it horizontal, new raids and dungeons but no level-increase. That'd be amazing. Similar to Runescape. They had the right idea on long-term sustainability (although they ruined it with their combat revamp which necessitated OSRS which is flourishing now). 
---
Agreed. I think that's the patch that introduced LFD. 
---
Their toolkit can be great with people. You're always a welcome complimentary part of a team but you have to know your weaknesses and know how to adapt. A druid is never going to do the most dmg at 60. Period. We know this. If you're with a warrior, root the other teams healer and throw a HoT on your mans. Toss a few moonfires out there and do your thing. I think druids are really versatile and can handle any situation, and I think they're amazing for PvP, but if your mindset is to just be a cat and try to DPS, I hate to say it, but roll a rogue then.
---
This is coming from a place of love - I played a druid on a certain private server a few years ago. Downed Neff with the guild I was in, and because I had been so consistent with raiding I absorbed a lot of off spec pieces (along with healing pieces or set pieces). Eventually I made a really interesting hybrid spec and went to town PvPing with all the sweet gear I had. I highly recommend it. Just know your strengths.
---
Sorry but what vanilla WoW did he play to say only 0.1% raided and it was barely a thing? Sorry but that is so wrong. Everyone who wanted to equip further than dungeons had to go to raids or spend time in pvp for getting a higher rank. And most people did that. Only a few raidgroups per realm had the chance to really clear the newest content, but still nearly everyone I knew back then in WoW did at least MC or Zul'Gurub. 
---
How depressed were you? After it ended. When it was over and the lights came on. What was your general feeling inside? Did you google maps "nearest gun store" like I did?  
---
It's actually hilarious how delusional you are. Kaplan flat out said that pvp is where "you can show what you got". Every game before that had PvP from Blizzard. Warcraft? Was Dune II with PVP. The next game Kaplan designed turned out being all PVP. In the beta his GRANDMA raided. WoW was supposed to be a PVE/PVP hybrid that was casual to begin with. Delusional people like you and Ion are who ruined it. Raiding was gated around gear progression. They just allowed try hards to make consumables all week to get a few months ahead. It was never designed to be impossible content until the last raids in an expansion. This all changed with new leads that were trash.

**Northshire Vineyards - Elwynn Forest**
---
The second page of his Sketchbook depicts a young, tranquil vineyard growing between large leafy trees. A small note attached to the page reads as follows...
---
####*"I remember when I first started to get my lay of the land, I had the pleasure of spending some time at Northshire Abbey. In exchange for fresh food and the warmth of a nice hearth, I spent some time working for Millie Osworth, the owner of a nearby Vineyard, I remember it had only been planted a few summers past and the vines had barely begun to fruit."*

What are you talking about? I fell in love of his telling of the Avatar Ahhhng and his bison OOOOHapaa!
---
I just want mother fucking talent trees back. And I want people to be able to make wrong decisions when they level up. I want people to be able to do niche situational builds with their talent tree.  
---
To be fair, agility and spirit stacking while leveling a shaman with 1h/shield is an underappreciated build. You regen so damn quick.  
---
The Harnessing Shadows Series convinced me to main SL lock in vanilla and I loved it. It has a very interesting Kite / CC / Tank / Drain playstyle.

I used lesser heal on the shaman my first MC and I didn’t have a raid frame addon

You mean when there was 16 debuffs, with later talents that made it a joke, with itemization that is a joke? All those nerfs are in Classic btw. When he talks about raiding he is talking about current, just like modern WoW. No one calls themselves a raiding guild who only does old nerfed content in catch up mechanic gear and there was catch up gear in Vanilla in the form of blue drop BOE, crafted like bloodvine etc. The raiding guilds can do MC with 20 people after those nerfs. They WILL do that in Classic to gear faster btw.

WotLK was the best WoW experience for me personally. Vanilla and Tbc was me just trying to get my rogue to Max level and once that happened I was too far behind to get invited to raids so I just Pvp'd, had fun. But I decided to make a priest and do end game content. Funny enough about 3 weeks after hitting Max level I was invited to a guild and I spent the rest of WotLK raiding with my new guild (we got kingslayer a month before Cata released and it was magical.)
---
During Cata towns felt dead, lost guildmates and the guild never recovered.
---
Have you played BDO like he suggests in that video?  It never really sustained any popularity, I'm just wondering why.
---
Sunwell a dull raid?...
---
I absolutely loved Arena and probably accounts for 70% of my total WoW time over the many years I've played the game. However, I completely agree with your points. I would have liked a system similar to Guild Wars 2 for WoW Arena - make all Arena PvP almost a separate game entirely, like the tournament realm. Gear given to you, auto max level, and heck they could even balance the Arena PvP separately. Their inherent refusal for a long time to balance PvP and PvE separately is what caused so much suffering for both of the playerbase, imo.
---
That helps, thank you. I had no expectation of shredding people in cat form, so I'm not let down by that fact.
---
The most alive? We had very different experiences, SW was always bear empty and Ironforge was packed to burst.
---
Because they got as greedy as Bobby Kotick and Activision. It was still a better game at the time than modern WoW. Modern WoW isn't even a MMO. It's two failed esports where the main audience is viewbots by "pros" that often make less than a Wendy's employee, dress up barbie and a badly written RPG that people only think they are good if they have never played something like The Witcher 3. 
---
You can't even do anything MASSIVE in WoW like this. If you do the modern zones will crash with 1/3rd the number of players.

Hemorrhage is the best way to quickly stack combo points on a target, allowing you to perform the infamous 10 sec "stunlock" combo in PVP but it does inferior damage compared to SS.
---
Riposte is a very nice skill for leveling, since it does nice damage almost for free (10 Energy) disarms your enemies (if it's possible) dramatically reducing their damage done you and not allowing to use certain abilities which require weapon, so it does not affect casting. Of course disarm effect is not going to work if your target is a beast or something, but it still does damage. Also it's quite a nasty surprise in PvP vs other melees as well. 
---
Disagree.  You can have all-around viability without homogeneity.  They just did it poorly.  Every arena season in TBC and WotLK had vastly overpowered classes, so they didn't even solve anything.  They basically took the easy way out.
---
Which is interesting since the entire city is peaceful. So if that's even more peaceful, it's pretty cool. I like the back of the water pool in there.  
---
&gt; you WILL be screamed at in chat
---
I will eagerly await this and enjoy it more than I can describe.
---
What’s your in game name? You post this same comment every time my name comes up, so clearly there must be some kind of history between us.
---
Would really like to know who you are in game! Cheers mate.

moonfire spam brings back memories

You don't have to sell me on classic WoW, or the failures of modern WoW, I'm just wondering specifically about BDO since I never played it.
---
Things I enjoyed during my time in retail TBC:
---
\- Doing heroics for badges with my friends who were 100x better than me.
---
\- Grinding reps and farming gold for JC recipes to try to collect them all. (I indeed didn't collect them all)
---
\- Farming Kara with my guild even though we were all terrible, we had a great time mucking around on vent. My friends were super hardcore and they would do kara at the same time - one night they cleared kara with their guild while I was in combat with Attumen/Midnight with mine.
---
\- Flying around helping random strangers with low-level elite quests (Nagrand was good for this)
---
\- I didn't really like dailies much, but would do the bombing quests (skyguard and ogri'lar ones) every few days because those were cool.
---
\- In the WOTLK pre-patch (so had new talents and achievements but no northrend) I got my bloodsail rep by abusing the OP paladin talents. I could pull like half of booty bay at a time, made me feel like a god for the week or so before they buffed the guards level.
---
Don't get me wrong, I also love vanilla. I'm just saying that just because you didn't enjoy your time in TBC, doesn't mean that everyone else had the same experience.
---
Maybe, they will probably make the item become soulbound and be untradable, might work for other items/enchants though.
---
I don't care about getting to 60 within the first month 
---
The Ravenholdt manor!
---
From my personal experience Druids are great at running away and staying alive. For the most part you kill enemies by out lasting them. I had a ton of fun with that in world pvp.
---
That mostly means you will be healing in group pvp settings. If that sounds like fun for you there is a decent skill cap and a lot of fun to be had. Yes you can play balance or feral in pvp but balance (not boomkin...) is more 1v1 wpvp and while feral works it’s also not too hot in a group setting. Druids healers are very useful in pvp groups. I thought of it as a “pvp tank”. Yes a tanky pvp healer that can escape a lot of danger and outlast the enemies.
---
I don't think you understand what you're advocating for. The game is littered with these loopholes because everything isn't streamlined and enchants are far from the worst offenders. At level 39 melees can spend a thousand gold and get a 4.0 speed 2-hander that resembles a crappy level 60 weapon while everyone else is running around with outdated garbage. In the low level brackets you can stack more HP than the rest of the players in the entire BG has combined. The only way to normalize the difference is to take the retail route and squish all stats to the point where they mean nothing and everybody ends up losing.
---
If someone doesn't have the social skills to participate in endgame with people who fight back and instead wants to sit in a queue for hours just to annihilate the same helpless baby deer, who am I to tell them they can't. At least they're putting money back into the economy and helping lowbies get their mount funds together quicker. Having exceptionally valuable/good items available from low levels makes the game a more interesting and well rounded experience.
