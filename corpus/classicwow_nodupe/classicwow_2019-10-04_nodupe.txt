But you'd be hopping between 2-3 layers. It wouldn't be nearly as effective as people claimed. That's the point. You'd be going back to layers you'd already been in that wouldn't have repopped or had the same competition you'd previously been trying to escape.
---
---
---
Absolutely, I’ve gone that route on every vanilla warrior I’ve played. Defintely need the swing timer add on to properly use it. 
---

---
When you get slam alongside the WW axe at 30, start popping it straight after every auto (unless you’re vsing multiple mobs, that will push the cast bar back to irrelevance). You will notice a much better dps that only gets better with imp slam.
---
im glad i dont participate in drama like this, a lot of these kinds of people that get on other accounts or whatever to whisper seem like mentally unstable or very childish
---
nice!
---
thanks
---
" My cooking fire burns more than you do. You ember you."
---
That makes so much more sense! I kept waiting for a deeper story to kick in.
---
Im level 34 and have 7 gold. Though I d/e most greens. Which is actually benefitial because the mats sell for more than the items. But I store them and use them for enchanting
---
Why not just farm gold somewhere more suitable and buy the mats on the AH?
---
For what you are looking for I would say survival would be a bit of a double edged sword. It is great for running around in the world and staying alive/avoiding death, but you will never out dps a MM or BM while leveling/farming those BoE's. Although if you can learn to kite well they can kite mobs better than a MM or BM can.  
---
You are also extremely gear dependent as survival due to the Lightning Reflexes talent. But if you did get BiS gear you could potentially outdps a MM hunter by Naxx just due to this one talent alone. 
---
It's an oddball spec for sure but go for it, could be a fun challenge for you.
---
Legendary quest. It has to be this.
---
I'm way late here, but are you sure rend doesn't trigger overpower?
---
This is not how the game plays out.  I've got the luxury of being able to play wow all day at work - I've done hundreds of dungeons so far, pugging quite a few people along the way.  I've seen at least 8 BoE epics drop in groups, every single time the whole group Needs without worry.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You cannot apply the same rigid set of rules to boes and bops of 3 different rarities that allows for zero nuance.  This is common core education levels of EVERYTHING FOLLOWS THIS STRICT ARBITRARY RULESET and you're asking to have items actually ninjad from you if you do this. 
---
If you're in a full guild/friends run and you have a different set of rules to go by, then whatever.  PuGs should always need on items that are valuable on the AH.
---
Is the remedy that good? I carry around a couple of stacks on my non-dwarf rogue at all times, but I have yet to use it even once. The thing is, it shares cooldown with healing potions, and  so far I would much prefer to pop that extra little health to secure my life in a 1v1 or especially 1v2 wpvp scenario.
---
JUSTICE DEMANDS RETRIBUTION!
---
Ah, I see. Double cast, nice.
---
A few of us play horde.
---
Don't try to use reason with someone that comments on TheDonald, is pointless.
---
I’m referring to before the hotfix. Back then there were many more layers.
---
That has literally nothing to do with what is being said.  Someone is saying (implicitly) "Here's a perk of staying on Skeram or Stalagg: instant queues!"  The reality is that this point is a terrible one, because there's instant queues on Heartseeker as well.  I didn't say "Why stay on Stalagg or Skeram?", I said "Why stay on Stalagg or Skeram \*for the instant queues\* \[when you'll also get them on the alternative\]".  
---
The idea that there might be other good reasons to stay on Skeram or Stalagg has nothing to do with whether or not this individual point is a good reason to stay on Skeram or Stalagg.
---
Yea you won’t find a big main story like in retail, however classic takes place four years after Warcraft 3, so you could brush up on that lore for a better understanding of the world and lots of the zones.
---
Warriors are one of the worst solo levelers. Doesnt matter your build. You need to spend gold twinking and on consumables just to make them ok at it.
---
By then the spawns would have been up though. It doesn't take long for them to spawn back.
---
I’m not saying having optimal gear is not important. I’m saying if you can’t understand that a bis list isn’t going to give you objectively the best gear set for every situation then you ought not to use them.
---
Did you even read bruh?
---
&gt;5 keyboards infront of me customized to have a single key that i press with different fingers
---
May as well, a 30g windfall is nice at level 30.
---
&gt; I dont know them that well since they are so many levels below mine. I havent been grouping with them really.
---
This can be awkward, I was in a similar situation where I joined a guild, and then a week or so into it everyone left for a raiding guild.
---
I was left as the highest level at like 51, at which point I'd get a bunch of tells from guildies asking for help with quests or farming, and initially it was fine, but after a while it got a bit bothersome since some of them would expect me to give up like 1-2 hours to farm tusks in STV so that they could get their WW axe.
---
&gt;I guess they will catch up soon though since some are in their early 50ties. But right now it kinda sucks.
---
You can always wait it out and see if it improves, maybe give it a week and if you still feel like it's not the right place for you, reach out and ask if you can join another guild.
---
I think you have the wrong view of what the stock market actually is if you think it doesn't work like that.
---
Remember when nintendo share price mooned when pokemon go was released even though they had nothing to do with the app?

You're looking for the story during Classic WoW? I'm not too sure of any sources other than wowwiki. You'll need to piece everything together through individual wiki pages.
---
You can get pretty much all the story through quests.
---
[deleted]
---
arathi and hillsbrad tend to be more alliance than horde on my server STV is always a shit show because horde can fly to booty bay, zeplin to their outpost or sail in from ratchet.
---
What about the EU servers?
---
Wait. You are late 50s. Why shouldnt they leave to go off to start their WoW careers? It sucks when your leveling guild breaks up. But its just what it is, a leveling guild. Youll have to move on for endgame content
---
Yeah I'll probably end up just doing that. Not sure the best places to farm gold though. I've watched some videos, but all those places didn't really seem good when I tried.
---
I think RP servers and small servers favor need for upgrades more.
---
And you're have the ability to be the tank, imagine being a pure dd class QQ
---
I can feel your pain. Godspeed, Stalinwolf. Godspeed.
---
Point of a turtle type pet is to aggro, not do dps. Dumb joke is dumb.
---
My classic guild would tell new trials to GTFO when they got the guild invite. Some fun new member hazing.
---
Everyone picked herbalism as a starting profession thinking they will make money. All the guides recommended it
---
&gt; You are the only upset lmao. My other post spells it out so 
---
No actually it doesn't, you have no logic and are just throwing a tantrum because you don't get your way. "And the I know you are but what am I" grow up.
---
&gt;i wont bother repying to you anymoore while your being obtuse.
---
Wrong yet again, you wont because you cant, youre wittle feelings dont equal facts.
---
From what I've been hearing. RP is mostly dead in retail due to getting lumped in with normal players.
---
I managed to do the 27-32 grind last week and it was awful. I’m a shaman too so it’s ridiculous until I get WF totem.
---
Maybe you should learn to take a joke.
---
This is absolutely fantastic!!!
---
I am a priest named Warllock and also support this!
---
I especially hate the wow gnomes. Look at their stupid faces.
---
Classic layering experience yo.
---
Merging two dead realms doesn't make an alive realm, I've been there before.
---
Memes are visual idioms, seeing an image like this further binds the community while defining its values
---
For instance every shaman can commiserate with this quest. Now ever shaman that commented/posted here feels a little less alone. And any of his/her anguish from this ... memorable quest has been transmuted into humor.
---
You know, I'm something of a SHAMAN myself
---
[removed]
---
That’s not how it’s supposed to work. Everyone needs gold duh. Need is supposed to be used for something you wear and/or need for your profession, NOT for selling because ooooo money. You are legitimately wrong in your interpretation of the need/greed system. Blizzard did not intend for it to work the way you think.
---
What's the point of sharing the account? I don't get what the "big guilds" would get from sharing it. Then it's not even theirs.
---
I agree that I'd rather someone put together a service for me to pay for most things rather than me investing time for a one-off product but I think it's funny that you call him an internet tough guy after you making what sounds like a threat haha. 
---
But anyway, check out the site Printful. You can upload a digital file and have it printed and shipped to you. You can even get it done with stretched canvas or a framed picture. I have never used their print service for artwork/photos or any of that but I've used them for t-shirts and my experience was 10/10 in that regard. [Here's a link if you want to check it out. It would](https://www.printful.com/custom/wall-art/canvas-prints/canvas-in?technique=CANVAS&amp;size=24%C3%9736&amp;region=USA%20and%20Europe)[ probably take you 15min to do from start to finish.](https://www.printful.com/custom/wall-art/canvas-prints/canvas-in?technique=CANVAS&amp;size=24%C3%9736&amp;region=USA%20and%20Europe)
---
That said you should get permission from whoever the original artist is if you can, out of respect.
---
It’s a 5 person levelling dungeon. We should be better than this.
---
I’ve got three between two and six. And I’m a self employed truck driver so it isn’t exactly a good idea for me to be tired at my job haha. 
---
I’ll get there eventually. Probably by phase 5 hahaha
---
I'm still waiting for you to present an argument why is isn't a dumb choice to equip an item that you can sell for 100g, if you don't get near that much value of it compared to selling it and buying more applicable gear. It is dumb to choose an option that makes your character objectively worse off. 
---
And yes, saying that you are entitled to a 100g sellable item is at the expense of your party members. They each deserve 20g worth of equity from it through  rolling, you are taking that away from all of them just because you believe you deserve it.
---
I had that happen to me the other day. Freaking out because i was almost dead, expecting to be one shot. I had just snacked my VW as well to get out a hair situation. The undead mage was just being friendly.
---
Not going there.  It's like drinking.  Just Say No!
---
Hah, this never even occured to me but it’s simple enough. Jeez.
---
It's probably as much the same people playing less as it is people leaving. People always wind down their play time further from release. Also people being spread out around the world vs clumped in starting zones is huge for having fewer layers. It's as much about local zone crowding as it is total realm population.
---
&gt;Terrible strawman, I'm calling you a piece of shit because of your beliefs and actions.
---
Uh, yea that is why you are a self righteous prick. You think anyone who values aesthetics or rare items is a piece of shit. It would only be a strawman if I said you argued something else, which I clearly didn't. You see someone with different priorities than you, and you demonize them, because you think your way to play is the only way and you can't imagine someone actually caring about how their character looks.
---
&gt;its what you believe and why.
---
That is the same thing as calling people a piece of shit for not agreeing with you. I don't agree with you, so I am a piece of shit in this situation, get some self awareness.
---
How is only needing for bigger numbers more moral than needing for rare aesthetics? Haven't you ever noticed how people will spend an extra 1600g on runecloth just to use another races mounts?  Or farm 1000 hours to get a off color frost saber? Are you fucking stupid?
---
guy sounds like a min/max tryhard dictator, find someone else to run with. The current content is nowhere near hard enough to demand that people build their characters around the raid leaders whim.
---
sorry for irish potato famine quality
---
What about my post indicates that I think /who is layer specific?
---
I did lbrs last night at 58 and the healer told me to use my 2H until bosses...
---
Beautiful map. I only saw a couple things missing from it.
---
Incorrect MoonGlade Flight paths.
---
Missing Alliance Flight Path on West side of Thousand Needles.
---
lmao, awesome
---
shazzrah eu best realm &lt;3
---
What’s the irony?
---
Tbh I fought with 100 people for quest mobs anyway, so... 
---
It's more of a question on how fucked do you wanna be? We didnt get as fucked as bad as it would have been without layering. It was nuts on launch when I spawned in right as it opened up and there was like.... a thousand lvl 1s all spawning in at the same time, lol.
---
&gt; D tier DPS
---
ah, an optimist I see
---
and then we would have ended up with dead servers, because clearly enough players left that they were able to remove so many layers
---
I swear half this subreddit is mentally challenged
---
Hit X. Free rage.

#nochanges
---
I don't know who is handing all this meth out to DPS players but they need to dial it back,or cut it with weed. Twitchy rogues throwing knives to pull and fucking up my charge gets annoying fast.
---
End game content is a lot more spread out and a lot more instance focused. Also, a lot of people are no nowhere near level cap.
---
toon: level 57 UD Lock
---
gold: 150

---
next goal/hope: get to 60 by this weekend and knock out my Ony attunement. After that start gearing for phase 2
---
Rattlegore?
---
Gehh is one of the most populated realms on EU.
---
Raid environments just need concurrent subevents where shorter casting uptime, dots, and mana reliant offtank specs are useful.  So like a side path where a mini dungeon needs defeated to pull a lever or something so that the rest of the raid gets a major buff or similar.
---
The actual talents, abilities, even gear, shouldn't need to change. They're already fine for 5 man and pvp.
---
This would be really cool without the flight paths
---
LOL, just because YOU want it that way doesnt mean it should or always has been, your feelings dont mean shit and 2nd time with the "I know you are but what am I" Can you think for yourself? like at all?
---
I feel very very sad for you, being this emotional over losing an item, maybe video games aren't for you.
---
This is part of early game mmo. Join a leveling guild, or a few until you find the right one. Mass spam invites, tons of people. All fun and games, but then the newness wears off, and some start logging in a lot less. The diehards outlevel, and soon find they have to search out of guild for groups. 
---
That initial group of high levels will quit and join a "end game" guild. Tons of endgame guilds will start raiding, then that same cycle happens. Burnout, failure, and then raid guilds start to fall apart. Some merge, some stay as a guild and raid as an alliance. Eventually it works out to have a few great raids on the server, some alt raids of those guys, average raids, and the ones that couldn't beat the trash but keep trying. 
---
It has happened since 2004 for this game.
---
Thank you kind stranger for the silver! GLHF!!!
---
Do you really think you’ll be able to 1v1 a competent level 60 warrior at level 40?
---
It's like I always thought it was En'zoth, not Ne'zoth. ;s
---
I have a kill list that I have names typed into of the opposite faction lmao. But also it’s not a guild or server wide list of course haha
---
Pretty sure that's Kingsblood, a pretty worthless herb by comparison.
---
Ok thanks.
---
it's normally where horde gather when going to blackrock
---
If my wife catches me awake before 7am she makes me go jogging with her.
---
Near the later versions before we got personal loot, it was fairly common to just agree that everyone rolls need on BoE. 
---
I found that absurd because sometimes it would be a legit upgrade for someone. But that's why playing with friends is better.
---
[I love this shit, you think he can even loot the thorium while having that much salt?](https://i.imgur.com/0hQyd5L.gif)
---
Maybe I'm a nitpicker, but on Moonglade the druid FP and the normal FP are not in the same place
---
This is why I play a tank. I have more groups than I know what to do with.
---
At that level range, you don't have to worry about dps and tank warriors competing for plate
---
she gets skipped ma boi... just bring it up with the group ahead of time, people are usually ok with it. clearing the trash too her can get groups wiped if they don't pay attention. I don't know how many I tell the melee to "NOT STAND IN THE GREEN STUFF"... doesn't always work
---
No. Classic is not cross-realm. Layering is copies of the world within a server. So say a layer is 3,000 players. If there are two layers, that means the realm capacity can be 6,000 players. However, only 3,000 players will be sharing a world at a time. Them removing layering is so those world copies are now united into a single world again, as intended.
---
Is it high pop? Literally every zone I go to is overrun with mages aoe grinding everything in sight.
---
Holy mild batman
---
Find herbs
---
Na days or weeks of gameplay is easily possible. Not everyone plays like you.
---
You want Mythic, go play retail.
---
Fuck you, shamans shoulda been tank first. Gimme my goddamn Earth Warden.
---
:)
---
Yeah single with a career. I definitely made WoW classic a priority and had planned to. Gave up working out as much and some other hobbies to play until I got 60. I didn’t take any days off work however. Mostly only played WoW after work and slept as little as 5 hours on some nights. I had ideal routes planned and never wasted a second in game though. Made it exactly one month after release and I took like 3 days off because of the initial depression from transferring servers lol. Now I’ll just have to do another month of the same I guess to have an alt on a more populated server.
---
&gt; What's the point of sharing the account?
---
You get to play on a rank 14 character with great gear and kill lots of folks
---
Your guild gets to claim "we have a grand marshal" 
---
I mean this is the game where people spend a bunch of money to have a cool mount.  People do it for lots of reasons, but probably most because its the only way they get to play a r14 character, which was very dominant back then.
---
Why do people always complain about this? Just mute the video.
---
Robe of the Void is BoP...did you mean something else?
---
I still laugh about how warriors, and of all things, troll shadow priests are eerily similar in this respect. it's just a matter of "hit me, so I can generate some rage and smash your face" and "hit me, so my shadowguard can melt your dick off and I can get some nice fast mind controls off with berserking".
---
when 75% of your raid group is on indefinite trial mode with no set end date, you aren't building a raid group, you're making the trials carry you for free.
---
not true, the attack speed definitely affects dps in classic. even the blizzard tooltip says so when mousing over damage. I saw a dps increase when moving from a 1.3 -&gt; 1.0 pet
---
Nowhere else have I seen such a concentration of stubbornness, gatekeeping, elitism, socially and mentally challenged people than in classic WoW.
---
From all of these posts with identical rolls, I've noticed that it always seems to go to the person whose name is first alphabetically...
---
Dont you mean orcs?
---
Fire above, ice below
---
This brings me flashbacks of trying to complete the set in vanilla. And that one warlock in my guild who snagged all the gear from the other locks because she was a girl. Always asking favors and never returning them... you took advantage of our kindness, Dragkhari!
---
I don’t want world quests and rep grinding to be endgame. I love wow as a whole but wod legion and bfa endgame has not interested me. All I want to do is lvl characters and then do nothing. I want a compelling story and less rng. Get rid of lfr so having guilds can take you to the next level instead of handing out raid loot. Dungeon finder is fine but don’t give so much xp boost so we can enjoy the world more and not just grind dungeons
---
Yeah, I liked legion though. But the changes they made sucked after they removed all the weapons and extra abilities and modifiers.
---
Extortion is against the ToS
---
Anyone have Tim's POV lol or was he afk there
---
That's what EVE Online does. Here are some spaceships and some asteroids to mine. Go.
---
Check the AH first is ideal. These sell for only 12s on my server.
---
Can someone explain layering to me in stupid form? I’m confused
---
Yep i remember, you could purge the initial aoe CC to help break others in some situations.
---
God i miss that game lol
---
Thanks for sharing, this is fucked and we shouldn't have to put up with it.
---
Someone should make an AI bot that you can turn on to converse with these people. I say "AI bot" but I just mean a script that blurts out a handful of phrases, such as;
---
* My Dad works at Blizzard and he's going to ban you LOL
---
* My level 60 friends are going to come and gank you LOL
---
* You're on KOS list for all major guilds on alliance LOL
---
* Follow me to Wildy
---
* omg ure such a noob, u think this is my main character?  LOL my main is 60
---
* U THIKN U KEWL BUT U GAYE
---
That's what I'm saying. Resetting combat several times Ina duel is too much. I'd laugh in vanilla dueling people who had to pop long cooldowns, pots, thistle tea, blind, etc just to win.
---
Curious what you did? I got the hide tonight. Debating if I should complete this or stick with Crimson Felt Hat
---
If you're pugging a raid you don't get to also have a loot council because you don't have enough of a guild to deserve it.
---
Marry her 
---
xD
---
Target canceled my preorder :*(
---
Report him. Blizzard takes people telling others to kill themselves extremely seriously, and it sounds like dude needs a break from the game to calm down.
---
the bass drop kek
---
I dont believe that for a second
---
*prot paladin twitches*
---
I mean it’s all pretty decent for world pvp and bgs. Most players are never gonna raid.
---
Ahh well, I ran from Mulgore to Barrens, to Durotar, to Barrens, to Somewhere else in Durotar and to the Barrens again.
---
Careful, he might bring his main as well. His uncle works at blizzard you know!
---
I did enjoy the leveling experience by the way and enjoyed every second of the nostalgia and beautiful zones.
---
This is from someone who's played classic a ton - My work affords me the luxury of being able to play during those hours.  
---
The half of reddit who holds the strange utopian "only need if you're going to equip/use" rule is by far the minority of in game players and are asking to be taken advantage of.  The vast majority of people see a boe epic/blue and slams the need button.  This is the smart thing to do, it allows everyone in the group an equal chance at a fat sum of money.  I've done hundreds of dungeon runs, seen at least 8 boe epics alone drop, and no one greeds on them.  If you greed, you are a sucker.  There are some blues that are actually worth good money that should be needed on as well, but in that case I'd just wait to see what the rest of the group does if you are not familiar with the item.  There are plenty of BoE blues that just kinda suck and most people will greed.  Again, wait to see what the group does for these. 
---
BoP items are completely different.  If you cannot equip a bop item, it must be vendored or disenchanted.  Theres no possibility of buying the item from the auction house, so need/greed works well here. 
---
This is how it works in game.  Do not be a sucker and greed on a warden staff because you're a rogue.  Do not be a sucker and greed on an axe of the deep woods because you're a mage.  The rogue/mage next to you WILL need on that item and you just removed the ability to possibly win 300+ gold because you stuck to some strange moral high ground.  This is about practicality.
---
I dont know about rogue leveling that much, but how would you ever use a level 19 twink weapon for WEEKS of gameplay time? 
---
If you're just fishing and roleplaying for months without getting any xp, does that even count as "using" the weapon?
---
If u roll need I expect u to equip it
---
If another player in ur group clearly benefits more from an item classwise than you I expect you to ask if it’s ok to roll need
---

Yeah the balance druid Quanta is actually a Feral druid. Checking the logs show that this balance druid is doing a ton of damage with cat abilities. I think its an issue with the way the logs class dps druids. Both balance and feral dps are given the balance tag
---
Oh, alright, that makes sense. Thanks for the reply.
---
Lol we only been together like 3 months.
---
This is fucking sweet. Reminds me of like a comic cover or indiana jones or something.
---
It was a "duel" to show off the weapon ceremoniously. thats why he was just sitting there
---
Not
---
In BfA if you toggle your war mode on then you suddenly have an arsenal of abilities to use in pvp you can't use if you had war mode off or if you were in a dungeon. How they justified this, I truly have zero clue
---
Searing Gorge was legit the worst wpvp experience I've ever had. For a few days I legit couldn't play my main, I've never been camped so hard. 
---
They had my corpse on lockdown, the FP killed and camped, as well as the GY. The horde has huge groups of patrols running around slaying any who thought they escaped. Honestly I had to just not play for a few days, it was a perfect storm of fuckheads ganking. This was last month, when I was 48ish, and there were like a thousand or so lvl 60s on my server. A shitload of them legit ruined that zone, lol. 
---
Btw I was never corpse camped in stv once, and I was only ganked there a handful of times. Desolace was no issue either, but fuckin searing gorge, good lord that was bad.
---
Yo what's that ui tho??
---
I don't know what part of "did that" doesn't communicate that I tell people to wait for me to establish the pull before they go ham.
---
If this is their first dungeon at 60, well... They gotta learn somehow.
---
Stands for not in stance 3 which is beserker stance,since you cant switch from beserker to beserker. idk if you get an error or not though
---
Context? I mean if he was there waiting for it to spawn and then you came out of left field and tagged it, I would understand his frustration. The whole blacklist thing is lame tho. CONTEXT?\~!
---
around 230g on my server atm, wish I had the gold... and the level to equip it :|
---
TROUT
---
That took me hours. Hours. Took me 3 different days of questing to finally get it
---
Couldn't agree more. No point to leveling if the world levels with you
---
Not by your definition.
---
You can't say "X is botting but Y, which does X, is not botting, because I say so."
---
Your argument is internally inconsistent.
---
It is against tos but is generally not enforced. My understanding is that they only take action if people REALLY abuse it/ spam the hell out of it and annoy everyone.
---
No. If something valuable drops that sells for a lot you hit need. Its how it has always been unless agreed otherwise by the party.
---
Your GF is very talented.  All the mages I know just make boring bread.
---
yeah i remembered about innervate about 20 mins ago haha
---
Honestly I wouldnt mind it, if there was more to choose from. I feel like there isnt enough sets in classic to get enough diversity.
---
noone cares
---
&gt; Warriors that refuse to tank are weird man.

As a warrior player I don't like tanking because I don't like setting the pace or the pressure with ensuring shit goes smooth. I just prefer to swing my axe and kill the dude with the skull above his head. I'll probably do endgame dungeons as a pure DPS ~~spec~~ class instead.
---
The correct logic is that if let's say a BiS dagger drops that the rogue can use right then. No one else can use it. The rogue says, "that dagger is BiS for me, I am going to need on it." The group says awesome and he gets it. The wrong logic is the mage or warlock or whoever's saying, "well I can take it and sell it and then use that gold to buy my epic mount so that I can progress quicker." I don't see how you guys see this and say "yeah that seems rational." When the same people saying this would lose their minds if it happened to them. 
---
The whole, "well if someone does need it they can talk about it." Is dumb af too. "Oh you need this item? I will sell it to you for x amount of gold." I mean hell using this logic no one should farm anything right? Just buy everything. Hell since we are all lazy af let's get blizzard in on it and just be able to buy the shit with real money. Then no one will argue.
---
The logic you guys are using is, "I am greedy and want a chance to sell the item that another person can use." Because fuck them right? This nihilistic approach is what makes the community unhealthy. But then that's seen in real life. No wants to work together at all anymore. It's me and my own vs everyone else.
---
Yup, the only thing I can think of in that same vein is missing an Ambush or Cheap Shot as a rogue.
---
OFC it's multifactored, but it's mostly down to either the new CoD game going on open beta or Classic.   
---
Google trends gives you that answer. [https://i.imgur.com/Tm6310c.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tm6310c.png)  
---
red = wow, blue = cod, yellow = wow classic  
---
And no that's not the only factor, but articles like this: [https://www.wowhead.com/news=295273/classic-triples-wow-subscription-revenue-in-august](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295273/classic-triples-wow-subscription-revenue-in-august) and [https://fortune.com/2019/08/28/world-of-warcraft-classic/](https://fortune.com/2019/08/28/world-of-warcraft-classic/) which TL:DR says that wow has risen to be the 3rd highest grossing game in the world, trippled subscriber count, increase from 50k viewers to 1.1 million concurrent on twitch (last 2 from [fortune.com](https://fortune.com) article, which investors sure as hell look at)   
---
You would be either naive or stupid if you think this hasn't had an impact on share-prices. Not the only factor, but it ofc has had a big impact.
---
I get the idea... but in actuality the average class in classic has so many more buttons than BFA because retail is so pruned down. 100% agree about talents
---
&gt;This can be awkward, I was in a similar situation where I joined a guild, and then a week or so into it everyone left for a raiding guild.
---
&gt;I was left as the highest level at like 51,
---
Yes, this is exactly my situation now. I feel bit left behind haha
---
&gt;bunch of tells from guildies asking for help with quests or farming
---
&gt;expect me to give up like 1-2 hours to farm tusks in STV
---
I havent been asked to pull people through content yet. I dont mind helping people,but that sounds awful lmfao
---
&gt;You can always wait it out and see if it improves, maybe give it a week and if you still feel like it's not the right place for you, reach out and ask if you can join another guild
---
 Yea i guess thats the most resonable approach. Thank you!
---
Orange?
---
And that's why you invest hundreds of hours in a production profession for the explicit purpose of creating A E S T H E T I C matching armour sets for you to wear.
---
This is literally the only reason I've been levelling Blacksmithing. The things I do for fashion...
---
Top notch advise. Wish I knew all this 10 days played ago. 
---
Especially arms leveling.  I did 2 h fury swapping to arms was the best choice I made. So much faster.
---
Joke's on me, I moved out of state in December and finally threw both of those away after having then stashed through owning 3 different computers in ~12 years. 
---
Then I found out about classic a few months ago. RIP.
---
does
---
just kick all of your warlocks except one and replace them with good classes, that way you dont gimp your raid and your spec
---
Did I get the drop on him?  Then yes.  Kite outside of intercept range in cheetah.  Use traps, scattershot, wingclip and a few others if he gets lucky.  A warrior who is slowed and out of range of intercept is dead, period.
---
With talents, my range is over 40yrds.  The biggest question is if I have enough ammo, mana, and don't fuck up.
---
The mechanics are all there.  Sure he can use bombs or fap, or whatever.  And even then, I can still outrange him.
---
Dead does 0 DPS. A warrior is a tank and doesn't die when it draws aggro. You sound like you don't even know what DPS stands for, or how a dungeon gets cleared.
---
This is really niche I guess but is there an add-on that, either intentionally or unintentionally, provides English quest text while playing non-English versions of the game or generally translates quest text?
---
I have been playing in Chinese and while read Japanese and can pretty easily figure out most things in the game with minimal study and intuitive knowledge of the Chinese characters, the quests are a bit too dense for my level of Chinese and skimming the quest text for directions only goes so far before I just go open up WoWhead. 
---
I want to be able to read the quest in English without a) putting the entire game in English (and then being unable to talk to people) or b) spoiling the quest for myself by going to WoWhead.
---
Maybe just don't look for excuses to be an asshole?
---
It's an issue they created so IMO it's an issue they need to fix, even if that means everyone can transfer for free for a limited amount of time
---
Its not the case for any item. BOP is a thing, thusly it is greed if I cant use it.... what you describe is impractical. Why do I get denied potential upgrades because I'm not the right class in the moment? That item could fund my bis items. BOE=/= BOP the sheer fact that you can fund your own progress literally means I need it as much as the guy who gets it directly. 
---
Here is a scenario if you like: you're in a dungeon group with a priest healer, frost mage, rogue warrior and you're a shaman. This is completely  a pug and nobody shared guilds or even had any relationship prior to this pug. Freezing Band drops from a trash pack. You're telling me that youd pass on an item that's worth 4 auction house upgrades to you just because there is a mage in the group? 
---
Obv he needs it as it's a direct upgrade.... but what if he doesn't use it? He can get by without it obviously. So what if that gold on the AH is worth more to him than having the ring... why does he get to ah the item and you dont? 
---
My point being that, in order to protect yourself from potential scammers-ninjas, EVERYONE should roll need in that scenario. If you're not an asshat and the mage is going to equip it, sell it to him at a deep discount. That way you get to celebrate your epic loot skillz and he gets that item still way sooner than he otherwise could have.
---
I guess i was hoping it would be more than a leveling guild. I could be mistaken though.
---
Depends on the use-case. Many (not all) uses of focus frames can be replicated in classic by other means.
---
Forced focus frame removal is actually a change, since you could have focus frame addons/macros in actual vanilla (as well as many other kinds of abusive addons/macros that aren't possible in the modern API).
---
You got me there
---
This!
---
Because you'll be like my group where 2 will get ravager and just not really care when there's a hint that we should move to cathedral.
---
Aoe farming isnt for druids dude,  make a mage if you're interested in that type of thing
---
Hey guys, I was told I should post this video here :)
---
me and a group of friends started playing classic WoW when it launched. I'd played wow back in BC, and have been playing retail since Legion, so none of us have ever had the vanilla experience.
---
We went into stockades blind, and we had a fun time. and I turned our experience into a meme video. I hope you guys find it funny :)
---
thanks!
---
There are a lot of other zones you could try. I would give them a shot.
---
Called Fashion Souls in Dark Souls games. Gotta look good while demon slaying.
---
I mean, they're not gonna be worth 27 silver forever. Even if it only doubles ive made several hundred gold at this point.
---
Thats amazing
---
Looks neat.  Seems like most do not have every feature im looking for.
---
Just thought I'd add some trivia; your wand is classified as a ranged weapon, so Agility will boost its damage and crit!
---
It's in the settings for shadowed unit frames. Just type /suf to bring up the options. Then it's Unit Configuration -&gt; Target, then at the top tabs it's under "Text / Tags" then you can choose what shows up on the health bars &amp; power bars. Oh yeah and what u/greater_being mentioned I have RealMobHealth v2.5.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/An0vH7m](https://imgur.com/a/An0vH7m)
---
Nothing is preventing you from doing that now. My server does WPvP events and it's pretty awesome. STV remains a warzone.
---
&gt; Majority of players still won't be able to reach endgame raids though.
---
The biggest factor (from Bliizard) in people not seeing endgame raids in Vanilla was that people were way behind and either couldn't or didn't want to spend months playing catchup, this is fixed by releasing phases when a reasonable amount of players are ready, not just the top %.
---
It took about 30 runs to get a ravager for both me and a friend. Rng is a bitch
---
I have it macroed in my SS, just dont have something i wanna put on 1 for now
---
I honestly don't even remember the guild name i was in it for so short a time
---
you could farm strat for righteous orbs, fish for water essences, or do go to your farm spots during off hours.
---
Yeah, Blizzard didn't really start making expansions tell a single cohesive story until Wrath. Classic is just all over the place.
---
devil's advocate: the tank wasn't planning on rolling on dps gear to start, but after the dps warrior started rolling on tank gear he decided it would be fair to do the same in reverse to him?
---
imagine rolling a spellcaster and running ubrs for jed drop
---
It’s not worth it. All 19 twinks will go for gravestone scepter from BFD. You pick it up in BFD and just have to kill the last guy. Totally free and way better dps plus stats on it. Only a few people would consider buying your wand. It’s not a hot twink item for anyone who knows what they are doing
---
Did you skin his kill? Cause then you would be the asshole here.
---
Good for pvp though
---
&gt; YOU FELL FOR IT, YOU FOOL
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; OVERPOWERS
---
My Overpower is actually macro'd to say this.
---
No, but they stated it never reached the double digits.
---
In ZF spinning to this day
---
Greed:
---
-Items that would not be a significant upgrade to your current gear.
---
-Items you have no use for besides selling for gold.
---
-Items your whole party has previously agreed to go all greed for.
---
Need: 
---
-Items that are significant upgrades to your current gear, and you plan to use.
---
Idk why people are downvoting this post. It's hilarious good content. 
---
Gz get rekt
---
If this is genuinely the case, then yeah I’ll agree that 2h is more threat. I was under the impression that no way it will proc as much as 1h+shield.
---
Whoa, what is this from?
---
Thank you brotherman will do more
---
Lmao, it actually made me sad though
---
This is what alts are for.
---
Is aoeing a bunch of AFK people that weren't expecting two full raids really world pvp though?
---
Yea don't trip bro. I found out about it an hour or two after announcement and it was already sold out. I had just gotten to work at like 11am and my day was immediately ruined.
---
I regret not buying up all the devilsaur leather now. The prices have been going up and every time I go to farm it there are always multiple groups now. The pants and gloves got me halfway to my epic mount with almost no effort.
---
Unless you're raid MT, warden staff is the poo poo.  I use that 2 crit/1 hit mace when I do 5 mans, threat is FAR more valuable.
---
You mean gold?
---
Ima just put it on the AH and see what i can get for it then. Ty
---
This is just a result of all warriors levelling as dps, the chances of you finding an actual main spec tank while levelling is slim to zero and so when a warrior joins the group immediately tries to convince him to tank so that they don't have to look for one for another 10 mins, which would probably be a dps warrior who just accepts to tank anyway.  
---
I'm playing Warrior too, I've been in this situation in almost every dungeon I've joined. I gave up on the 1h + shield though, it's impossible to hold agro because everyone goes 100% flat out and in the end that is the best solution, you don't need a dedicated tank most of the time anyway.
---
Big brain joke
---
That thing does NOT drop.  The hell with it.
---
&gt; my skinning is only 225 lol
---
"And your father smelt of gasoline"
---
shamans are good for healing and can easily get groups by queuing as healer, although your dps specs are considered “2nd rate” ppl with still pick you up for your utility. Honestly though, classic is all about playing the race and class you see yourself as... bc if your heart isn’t in it, you’ll pretty much give up before you hit 60.
---
"That dumb clown face of yours makes you look like a clown"
---
&gt;skinning is only 225
---
No
---
I'm beginning to think something is askew here. Will he love it? If he'll love I'll do it.
---
It’s not really a big ask. Tanking isn’t hard. Help the group dog. Or just leave he group and get back to soloing or find another group. Like most “problems” it’s pretty easy to solve.
---
I dont really see this as much different than killing an afk priest, its just scaled up larger. Lets see some non-afk steam roll pvp fights...
---
You know how you get better at things? You do them. Open world pvp is the literal best thing about vanilla, and it's so sad that so many people are missing out on it because they think it will be shit to level.. mate it IS leveling. I have barely been ganked and I'm almost 50, and I play on an Australian server, everything is packed.
---
I found this out the hard way :(
---
Discuss with your group. That's basically the only way to protect yourself and also not be a ninja. If someone goes against the negotiated terms you can report them.
---
How much gear do you need as a hunter to reliably do the mara solo farm? I can’t play that often so would it be better to play a rogue and do stealth runs instead? Also, how similar are rogues and warriors in play style?
---
Edit: I did cancel the trade. He /bowed and then immediately went to another guy and gave him the bags.
---
Bless
---
If you think everyone that does something you PERSONALLY dont agree with is an asshole then you have a lot of growing up to do. Not to mention a sanctimonious prick.
---
I emotionally connected to your story real hard
---
This guy needs help irl. Sad thing is he probably wont get it
---
/Pat
---
No, I'm not. 5 characters versus 1 character is 1v5. It's not 1v1. Whether those 5 characters are controlled by 5 people or 1 person is beside the point.
---
Do you think a level 40 character should reasonably expect to win against 5 level 40 characters?
---
Each of their characters don’t individually gain power that would otherwise be inaccessible to you or have their progression accelerated beyond what you could otherwise gain.  THAT is pay to win.
---
A multiboxer doesn’t have extra levels granted to them. They don’t gain gear faster (such as extra rolls or higher % chance to get the gear they desire). Those are what are considered “pay to win”. They are only paying extra to streamline what you could achieve with 4 other players, removing the factors that are out of your control.
---
My example was only to show a flaw in your poor logic, as you can spin it to suit your agenda if you make it ridiculous enough. We are all paying for the exact same thing. They are just *fairly* (that’s a big part) paying for multiple iterations.
---
One of the biggest things I thought Cataclysm did right was making the daily dungeon be 7 randoms that you could do whenever in the week. Not only did they take that minor piece of flexibility away (and ultimately make the concept of ordinary dungeons obsolete), they actually made it worse with world quests starting and stopping completely at random.
---
Wtf who cares
---
Because a lot of people on reddit cant grasp basic logic.
---
In Vanilla I played on a PVP server with a huge imbalance, and I played on the lesser side. In hindsight it was most great. Because we were outnumbered people would group up or immediate switch to mains to come defend. Getting ganked sucks but overall it was still a lot of fun.
---
JUSTICE!
---
I'm not the one weaseling lol
---
&gt;The correct logic is that if let's say a BiS dagger drops that the rogue can use right then. No one else can use it. The rogue says, "that dagger is BiS for me, I am going to need on it." The group says awesome and he gets it. The wrong logic is the mage or warlock or whoever's saying, "well I can take it and sell it and then use that gold to buy my epic mount so that I can progress quicker." I don't see how you guys see this and say "yeah that seems rational."
---
This isn't logic, this is stating two scenarios and saying one is wrong and one isnt without stating why.
---
&gt;When the same people saying this would lose their minds if it happened to them.
---
You are assuming everyone acts like a toddler when they lose a roll.
---
&gt;I will sell it to you for x amount of gold." I mean hell using this  logic no one should farm anything right? Just buy everything.
---
The most effective way would be to farm whatever gets you the most gold per hour and then buy things. That is why money was invented, and why blizzard implemented the trade window and auction house, so players can earn gold in various ways and create a community built around trade. If you had to go and farm every item you need by yourself you are making the game an order of magnitude more difficult. You can't physically farm world epics and if that is on your BiS list it is impossible to farm for it. The only things that make sense to farm directly are non tradeable items.
---
&gt;Just buy everything. Hell since we are all lazy af let's get blizzard in  on it and just be able to buy the shit with real money. Then no one  will argue.
---
This is a completely irrelevant statement that does not follow from any previously stated premises. Also how are you lazy if you are spending hours farming gold?
---
&gt;The logic you guys are using is, "I am greedy and want a chance to sell  the item that another person can use." Because fuck them right? This  nihilistic approach is what makes the community unhealthy. But then  that's seen in real life.
---
Not giving people free stuff is nihilistic?  Also we have established multiple times that I can use world epics not designated for my class. What about world epics that you can use but you make the judgement you will get more use for selling them and trading them for someone else? Is that nihilistic or just making a logical value judgement?
---
Out of all the people I have argued with today on this topic, YOU are the least logical. myci43's points were far more cogent than yours.
---
Well, quest rewards should be sufficient to cover that part - if you can complete them, especially the Deadmine/Wailing Caverns quest chains that ask you to kill all the bosses. You get rewarded with your first blue weapon.
---
u dont because the addon is trash. 
---
If you want to make money use TSM. Scans faster, has an automated central database for prices and much better auction interface.
---
&gt;Here is a scenario if you like: you're in a dungeon group with a priest healer, frost mage, rogue warrior and you're a shaman. This is completely a pug and nobody shared guilds or even had any relationship prior to this pug. Freezing Band drops from a trash pack. You're telling me that youd pass on an item that's worth 4 auction house upgrades to you just because there is a mage in the group? 
---
Umm...yes.  Yes, I'd give the item to the mage because that's how the Need/Greed system works.  If you were intended to just roll Need on every BoE, why does the game even ask?  It would just be roll or pass.
---
&gt; Obv he needs it as it's a direct upgrade.... but what if he doesn't use it? He can get by without it obviously. So what if that gold on the AH is worth more to him than having the ring... why does he get to ah the item and you dont? 
---
There is an honor system involved with the Need/Greed system.  For every drop, there's always the possibility that the person doesn't actually need it.  This doesn't change when it comes to BoEs.  
---
&gt; My point being that, in order to protect yourself from potential scammers-ninjas, EVERYONE should roll need in that scenario. 
---
How do you not see that YOU are the ninja scammer in this scenario?  You're using the possibility of someone else being an asshole to justify rolling Need on an item that you very specifically DO NOT NEED.  If you get everyone on the group to agree to it then fine, it's "fair"... but you're still throwing the Need/Greed system out the window completely at that point, the system that forms the basis of the loot system for every pug group in the game by default.
---
lol ironic bc I stopped playing retail during wotlk and was part of the pserver movement that helped get us classic.
---
I’ve had no problems in runs with sword and board tanks and Druid tanks
---
Arise, arise, Riders of the Alliance! Fell deeds awake, fire and slaughter! spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the Lion rises! Ride now, ride now!

DEATH

I had 0 gold at 30. Wanted to get all skills i felt like, level up tailoring and enchanment to relevant SP. Got the mount at 41, just vendoring everything I found and didn't wear from 30 to 40. I was lacking 10g at ding 40 so you could start with that.
---
Whenever I login to my toon all my macros are labeled with a ? even though i have #showtooltip's for them. Is there a way for this to not happen?
---
Most of the Anathema pop is between 30-50 right now.  Give it another month.  The server is certainly not dead.
---
I wouldn’t sacrifice Holy Shock for anything, even if it is Blessing of Kings, in my mind it’s a must have for a paladin, but I guess that’s a preference thing. 
---
I am aiming for somewhat the same thing you are, but I also want Blessing of Kings, so I figured I would forego Seal of Command and use both Judgment of Wisdom and Seal of Wisdom with a faster hitting one-hander in order to get in swings in between heals.
---
There are way more one-handers and shields/off-hands with intellect/healing+/spell crit than there are two handed weapons with those stats. Of course this means your DPS will suffer which makes this is a poorer choice if that’s what you are going for. 
---
As far as mana gain and support goes I think one hand and shield is a better choice, the bonus is you can go deeper into Prot and off-tank I sticky situations. 
---
TLDR; God damn I love the versatility of Paladins, but yeah don’t give up Holy Shock for Blessing of Kings.
---
Shadowy bracers.  Which I get, it's only 4 shadow dmg and the felheart are awesome, obviously. 
---
But they are bracers with stats and spell damage.
---
Silly Alliance should learn from the horde and bring a full raid for their ganks.
---
Questie is both a life saver and a curse. It took a lot of the detective work out of the game and reading the quests to see what i was doing. But at the same time it has saved me so much frustration over finding where things are for quests, as well as hours of self doubt questioning myself 'am i killing the right mob to get the item i need?'
---
I would say questie is a net positive though
---
Naw, don't be a bitch. You want to join as the 2nd warrior you're tanking dog.
---
I honestly never though it was an issue before, I dont use reddit that often so probably that.
---
well you haven't said anything of substancial value mate.
---
 So the numbers linked in the wowhead article regaridng revenue are false.. or; Meaning SuperData is not a reliable source of information.
---
Wait. Is this Mankriks wife?! That quest was almost as bad as the hooves. (New to WoW, husband converted me. Please be patient)
---
Humans find pattern in randomness
---
You could find a swapping service but most are probably scams and you have no way to get your gold back after a scam.
---
I feel like pure dps roles are good for soloing, though. Solo warrior is *rough*.
---
Tomorrow's karma is yours for the taking, my friend
---
CHARGE - resist.

MOOORTAL STRIIIKE - Dodge.

*Internal screaming*.  
---
**unmistakeable sound of a cheap shot**.  
---
***you died***
---
People like that don't wait and see they get all up in arms for months and months and ultimately it works out 9 times outta 10.
---
Yes, but bad troll is bad.
---
Can you explain to me the five second shaman rule
---
pretty sure that is the case but gotta double check once theyre online xD
---
He was understandably angry. And apologized after.
---
Then this casual player is a dumb dumb because if the weapon is lasting then “weeks” (meaning playing less than 3 hr a week) than selling it would’ve saved them months of farming gold
---
You can go into your list of KoS players and add a reason to why they are KoS.
---
Did you guys read to the end? He apologized. He was understandably upset. Think if the circumstances
---
If it takes 10-20 hours to farm an item worth 200g, the classes that can farm 500-1000g in that same time frame would happily pay the gold for it because it’s more time/gold efficient.
---
Yeah but only one of him exists!
---
Reputation bar. You can turn it off in the addon Settings.
---
&gt; and then we would have ended up with dead servers,
---
Because less than 2k pop = dead server.
---
Removing layers =! players leaving. It's more likely because players aren't all logging in at the same time (ie. all day) every single day as well.
---
Also, remember how blizzard used to merge servers that were super duper low population?
---
If you're a dude that plays female toons ur gey af
---
Haha exactly.
---
Ah man. That’s rough. :(
---
That’s the joke
---
Luckily from what I’ve been seeing so far, the classic blizzard team have been closely monitoring ALOT of stuff and working off of a lot of feedback. I can imagine that when P2 comes out when the PvP ranking system becomes live this will be the main focus. If they follow suite they will want to focus effort on trying to reduce and iron out these issues as much as possible
---
Guy literally apologized at the end. This is the kind of emotion that makes this game great. Report him? For being mad? Could have put him on ignore
---
Okay man! No worries I'll keep being a scumbag And you let yourself potentially be a victim because hundreds of gold means nothing to you! You're nieve to think that person is gonna just equip that. Also how am I a ninja if everyone rolls need? Its equal opportunity.
---
trash GM. leave ur guild
---
People love to regurgitate the negative shit they hear others cry about. Even I find myself barfing out reddit opinions sometimes and then realizing I'm basing that completely on what I saw some crying dude say.
---
Take screenshots, you? Lol
---
Because wanting to perform the role you joined for is definitely a "snowflake" attitude.
---
Its called etiquette. When yours drops you get yours, when my drops i get mine. The RNG decides. You are in a group with 5 people, your not gearing yourself, you are all gearing each.    
---
You dont want to talk about BoP, but its the same etiquette/ result.  
---
 As a clothie i need a str bop plate piece. If didnt always do this you probably missed out on 100-200g+ or more as you keep running things. Now the plate has to run it again, maybe many times. You effectively slowed down his progression and wasted his time, to speed your own.   
---
A 500g BoE BiS weapon drops, one person will equip it on the spot, the others all need and the AH wins. Yes that gold could progress anyone. Again you have effectively slowed down the weapon users progression, and wasted his time farming for something that already dropped, even though this was an item that wouldnt waste anyone elses time, standing as a progressive barrier ahead of them. WHY? You say its because the AH winner will sell that, and get an upgrade of equal value.   
---
Every BoE is a different price. Not every class need some uber pricey epic off the AH. There is very little chance it is of equal value at all. More like he gets his epic for 200g and has 400 going towards a mount fund. Meanwhile the weapon user has 1500g to farm out for both his mount and weapon.   
---
What if the AH winner uses that gold on only his mount? sure all gold has value in progressing, and everyone wants an epic mount, but is it really equal in value to the weapon user?   
---
What if the AH winner only spends that gold on buying things on the AH to re sell for more, now that he has that nest egg? What if he only buys deviate fish/ cosmetics/ gambles all of it away?? Maybe he just sends it to his level 10 alt?  
---
There isnt a way to know commit what he does with it after he won, and saying its equal value in gold/ progression is some best case scenario bullshit.   
---
Meanwhile the weapon user equips it on the spot, probably using it the rest of the run.  RNG has blessed him and the RNG gear system we all play with can be appreciated.  The timing and location of rare drops is actually significant in this game, it should be respected.   
---
I am about 70 plate drops away from buying my epic mount, and i could get those so quickly just gearing/running groups as I normally do. It could very well be the best path i can take to progress my goals. But the 70 plate drops and the people who can use them just waste their time.   
---
The etiquette is and always has been Need &gt;greed, Equip gets priority. You can always run your own group and say "all need BOE" at the start if you prefer it that way.
---
At 60 or with a single target shatter build it's roughly 8 int to 1 +spell damage, for aoe build int is King
---
IF there's a warrior in the group and edgemasters drop then it SHOULD go to the warrior since those are his best hands till around Naxx, they are worth 500g for a reason because there are classes that buy it because they NEED it, its that good. If you needed a boe epic that someone else in the group actually need you're a friggin' ninja, because you're just gonna sell that and make gold from it at the expense of said warrior. Making a rule where everyone just needs every damn boe epic or blue that drops is just a huge FU to the people who actually need it as an upgrade.

Druids provide a lot more than HoTs.

Does x5 give you 5 rolls at once?
---
I challenge you, Neptulon! Elemental lord of the Burning Legion!
---
I agree with xgogurtx it’s more than likely the experience bar or the reputation bar. The experience bar with bartender usually goes away at level cap but the reputation bar doesn’t. When leveling the experience bar generally hides the reputation bar. If no reputations are being tracked it’s a solid gray bar. I’ve had it happen to me in retail. Both can be disabled in settings as stated by xgogurtx.
---
The guy seemed to have been apologetic after he calmed down. I think people are over reacting.
---
Imagine sitting for 3 days waiting for 1 spawn and you die and come back and someone else took your spawn.
---
Id be irate too
---
at the end of the day, the choice is 100% up to the rogue. he has all the power in the transaction. if he doesnt want to unlock it for the group then he wont and there is nothing you can do to make him do it
---
*cries in poor money management*
---
On my lock i saw a group looking for a tank and 1dps for SM. I joined and there were already 2 warriors in the party. I LUL’d at them and left.
---
Good memories of this place. I got some sweet Hunter gear here way back when.
---
I think so too. I was helping kill some alliance that were killing some questing horde and added them to one of the kos add ons, not the spy one. When they run back and rez it would flash yellow when they're in my vicinity and I just had to look around and find them
---
Oh holy crap. That's a lot. Thanks for the help.
---
Because it's a shite opinion and also you complained about downvotes. Instant downvote from me.
---
Main is a 29 mage, enjoying the blend of questing and AOE grinding (early hours of the morning as competition is rough)  
---
Deciding on an alt that I am duo leveling with a friend, torn between Warrior/druid combo and Shammy/Hunter, I would get to 60 with a pocket heals as warr which is appealing. Though something about Heals x burst hybrid pvp monster gets me excited.
---
You are a druid.
---
You see Teebu's drop.
---
You are a Ninja druid.
---
You roll need.
---
You win Teebu's because everyone else rolled greed.
---
You sell Teebu's.
---
You get nice gold.
---
You use nice gold to buy staff.
---
You get called a ninja and get blacklisted for needing an item you didn't actually need.
---
The symbol for Greed is literally gold, I wonder why that is and what it was intended for. The whole system was kept in check by the server, it was agreed all over the server that if you did shit like this everyone would blacklist your ass and you'd be seen as a dodgy ass player to play with and no one would wanna invite you to groups because of it.
---
It wasn't mainstream like it is today. It was for kids. I'd agree that it was more fringe for adults. Those kids are now adults and they still game.
---
mfw I rolled Undead originally because it was the race I played in WC3
---
After being downvoted by people last time for saying "shaman can't tank" 
---
Turns out he can. Oh boy can shaman tank at low levels. 
---
even with trash gear I absolutely topped the DPS charts, healing chars and damage taken charts... as tank shamy in WC and SFK.
---
How were they supposed to know the guy refused to tank?
---
&gt; What blizzard said with that post wasn't that there is an issue with not enough people doing raids.
---
That's a flat lie. Blizzard has specifically said that the reason they tried 25mans originally was because of low raid participation in Vanilla. They also said the amount of groups that cleared Kara and the reception it had were major reasons in changing to 10/25 raid formats.
---
&gt; And you let yourself potentially be a victim because hundreds of gold means nothing to you! 
---
Not enough to steal an item from a party member who needs it.  No worries, though, anyone who tries to act like they were entitled to roll on items to sell on the AH will get booted from my group real quick.  I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
You can do the instant scan within 10 seconds if your computer and internet connection isn't from the 90s
---
It’s always funny when they show up with their buddies and you kill their buddies too
---
Good for you. Awaiting the TED talk.
---
He probably yells something about Ragnaros (and the other elemental Lord's) not being able to handle the old gods.
---
Prominence?
---
Yeah we have that too although it’s doesn’t always happen.
---
The interesting thing about that patch update is that it definitively codifies the designers' intent: if you "need" on a BOE it can only be sold to the vendor or used by the person (not even BOA--must be the toon that rolled). That puts a nail in the coffin in the argument that the game otherwise allows/intends for players to "split" the value of high-value drops or that certain classes don't "deserve" to need on an item simply due it its value on the open market. All of those are deficient justifications for ninja-looting, but at least this is evidence from within the game itself that items, regardless of their binding attributes or value, are intended to be worn if need rolled and greed rolled to keep them open-market sellable.
---
35-40 on Gandling Horde as well.
---
Anecdotal, but I've spent the last few days in Badlands, and I see the same two Troll hunters camping for Broken Tooth every time. They both come over and/kneel in front of my Broken Tooth (I got REALLY lucky) and I /pray for them. 
---
I'm Alliance, but some things are more important than faction hate.
---
Yeah analogies are really tough man I'm sure you will figure it out eventually. Meanwhile I only need 50 more plate BoPs for my epic mount, I get it while im gearing/progressing normally since i cant equip it, and its the fasted way to progress so theres nothing wrong with it.   I NEEDIT  
---
Its frankly hilarious how you cant see the difference between your greed, and something you actually neeed.
---
Stop pretending like its 2005 and no one knows what they're doing anymore. 2h tanking is generally fine, is a huge dps boost for the whole group, and is better threat.
---
You kill things faster, the tank holds threat better, and takes a little more damage. 
---
I have a couple other things while we're at it!
---
Warriors can and will use staves. The dps gain for them is better than the like 80 mana and 10 spirit the casters get.
---
Holy pals will roll on int cloth. Its the only gear available to them.
---
Look, the devs did a ton of stuff right in vanilla wow, but itemization and class mechanics were not one of them. Everyone wants to hang on to their fantasy tropes of "paladins MUST wear plate, tanks MUST use a shield, int staves can only be used by casters!" but the reality is, given how the game works, none of these common fantasy tropes are optimal in this game.
---
I understand why people would pay for it, but that has nothing to do with economics. Price is dictated by supply and demand. I'm stating that with how many players farm the whelps, I can't believe supply would be low enough to dictate a 200g item. Especially since I've seen little to no demand for the item.
---
I’m lvl 38 on Kromcrush. No problems what so ever, just the right balance of world pvp and groups for questing/dungeons
---
Was inna guild named "HOES MAD". every time someone joined, everyone would say "HOES MAD". blizzard made the guild name change hours later. Very sad
---
"Farewell for now." Lol

Being slightly lazy? lol what. ever. you. say.

Dance naked on mailboxes for tips.

pro tip: just take 1 Priest, 1 WL and 2 Mages, call it "Aoe farm" - no matter where you go.
---
Fuck off pleb
---
How do I find out the attack speed of my pet?
---
I'd say having 25-30g would be ideal. You'll get a lot of gold from the 30-40 grind. The bigger issue is to STOP spending gold. Hold out on skills you don't need, and give your professions a break until you get the gold you need.
---
Wonder what they're going to do when the population increases by 50% for 2 weeks every time there is a content update.
---
Can I buy one?!
---
So you do care?
---
Unless you meant couldn't?
---
As for Transmog, no.
---
If you have random gear you should look random.
---
If you have a set, it will match. Simple as that.
---
Less about removing layering. More about the abuses exploits level hacks and economic damage caused by layering. Disastrous failure.
---
If all you need is to kill quest mobs, whisper them and ask them to inv you, and turn on master looter.  They get the loot they want, you get the quest xp.  You don't get loot, but you'll be finished sooner at least.
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/index.php
---
No it wasn't. I layer hopped like 6 times in a row in the cave in Burning Steppes to farm Thorium/Mithril.
---
This is a beautiful thing
---
Anyone remember the post from week 1 where the guy talked about being the "Bag Man"?
---
Nice job. Next time I might suggest waiting until right before loading screen and then doing it. If you drop them out there they'll land in fatigue water and the only way out is hearthstone or Rez sickness
---
In these situations i tell everyone to neee but like you said theres a lot of new players, they might hit greed before i can type "everyone hit need" do we all greed and risk someone else ninjaing it or do we all need and screw over the noobie?
---
You ask too much.
---
I remember getting ganked in WPvP in Tanaris on my Mage, on the western side of the zone by Un'Goro.  I said "screw this, he's not getting the kill on me" and jumped off, into Un'Goro and the Alliance attacker followed me.  Sometime during the 6-8 second fall, I remembered I had slowfall, and I gracefully landed and went and jumped around on his corpse for a while until he released.
---
accurate to the battle of Helm's Deep then
---
Just renew me, damnit. It's no mana at all, and it'll heal everything -- and we keep on killing.
---
I've had groups where priests refuse to heal my taps. So I eat, fine -- BUT I have about x3 more HP than I should for my lvl (at 40 I am pushing towards 3k) so... yeah... food doesn't work in one go, nor two helpings... so... I just end up afking if Im forced to do that while I eat and it slows the team down immensely. Or a bitch healer could renew me for 0 mana. Hmm.
---
I do not regret leaving Blaumeux. Having Lv say "ding" in world chat five times a day was getting super annoying
---
farming mobs is slower than with dps classes but not by that much. ill buy epic point with gold from felcloth, also it make you farm demonic runes which is kind of mandatory to raid.
---
Can 100% recommended this. Yes they will hit harder but not as hard as the rest of the buddies they would bring along
---
lol holy shit yikes
---
Really? I feel like most of the guides I read suggested the skinning and mining dual gathering route.
---
An item that wont be replaced for years that is cheaper than it will ever be vs a mount at a static price when you will keep earning more gold over time. Pretty logical choice tbh.
---
I’m not condoning the other dudes actions. He definitely needs to chill the fuck out.  But that being said. People who ninja skins are jackasses. OP in this case did not ninja said skin and is not an asshole.
---
ok
---
Well no shit. He still transferred to a shit server. I feel bad for the dude. Shame he rerolled horde here or I'd give him some gold.
---
You are probably right. At this point i'm happy if the dps let me hit the target first.
---
Counter point - you can't put enchants on the AH so it takes up a lot of time but is far more social than other professions. I think alchemy is far more useful especially during these early phases without some of the more iconic enchants
---
You can literally replace shadowfang in a couple levels.  You can use the money you get from shadowfang to buy your first mount and still have enough left over other stuff. 
---
If you equip shadowfang while leveling, you are a dumb dumb.  Full stop.  And if you're a twink, you shouldn't be in shadowfang keep in the first place lol.
---
Off spec tanking gets difficult in later dungeons. If you do not have appropriate gear or suck or both, you aren’t going to have a good time. Despite having good gear to tank as a DW fury warrior, there are still dungeons I’m generally going to try avoiding as an off spec tank unless I know the group is good.
---
I ran a strat UD earlier today where the tank had an awful time managing aggro between myself (a nearly full pre-bis fury warrior) and another nearly full pre-bis rogue. He was still wearing some mail gear (at 60 wtf??) and had an awfully slow MH weapon and would get awfully close to dying very often. Our very competent healer just didn’t have the heals to manage him as well as the rest of us.
---
Nice
---
It still is.
---
... yes? that seems to make sense to me?
---
4d play

ARISE RIDERS OF VARIAN
---
You wouldn't, this guy is clearly just speaking out of his ass.
---
Imagine that in bfa the game would crash before the first attack
---
Woa, it's the battle of 8 armies
---
It's honestly like you're deliberately trying to miss the point
---
Maybe if this wasnt your first release you would know that loot has always been this way. Sorry i triggered your condition by mentioning your "entitlement".   
---
You should feel sad, you're drowning in greed over a fake online currency. You're so desperate for it you want to publicly argue for cheating and stealing. Dont worry man summer will come and you will have all the time you need to farm that epic mount, one day. Carefull not to cheat or steal anything IRL till you get there tho, ethics are just so hard.
---
I usually only stick people on my KoS list that genuinely deserve it. Body camping me more than once? KoS. Ganking grays? KoS. I usually don't KoS enemies (except rogues) unless they set off my KoS ping. *Then* I'll actually KoS them.
---
&gt; You are probably the only class that can dictate the speed of instance runs
---
I really enjoy tanking, and tank a lot on my warrior, but this is the exact same reason i **dont** want to tank *sometimes*.
---
Sometimes i want to be able to be in the group and be lazy like the other dps, charge in and spam sunder on whatever the tank marks as pulled. Sometimes I dont want to be leading the whole group and setting the pace while everyone else gets to relax.
---
I don't have the time to raid, so need a class that is awesome in solo pvp and battlegrounds and can do a little bit of pve for gear.  Need to be able to find a group easily.  I can do hours of BGs on the weekends and sometimes during the week but can't stick to a tight raid schedule so going to pvp mostly.
---
Green boes, main spec rolls. Blue boes, if above 50g, all need, otherwise, main spec rolls. Epic boes, tell everyone "all need" and need that shit. That's what ive been doing since release, no problems yet.
---
Yeah, I never got much into raiding because I really didn't like feeling obligated to be shackled my chair for any amount of time. I play for long ass hours, especially when I got nothin to do that day, but it's usually while also just randomly standing up and walking around to check on something or work on something when I get motivation to. PUG raids are their own beasts with a new list of reasons why to avoid them, but I definitely have felt like I've spent every time I play this game trying to find a guild that has a similar playstyle.
---
The other responses were pretty good so I'll just mention that you will lose 4 slots to totems. Not as bad as an entire bag space, though.
---
no, before retailers and twitch kiddies it was never acceptable to steal an item someone can use so you can sell it for gold
---
It clearly says "black list"
---
next time go with eat a hot bowl of dick
---
I played DAOC on Pellinor, and Albion had more people than Hibernia and Midgard combined. This was partially our fault as Hibernia, because we used the catapult exploit to steal the midgard relics in the middle of the night before anyone was close to geared/leveled enough to do it legitimately (as revenge for midgard's aoe stun BS), and then they royally screwed up trying to get it back and, with the help of some taunting, most of their realm ragequit the game or rolled on different servers. Having the albion zerg gave us something to fight against and made hibernia better,  but the few diehard midgard players were just absolute beasts. You'd never know when you were in the frontier if they were going to pop out of a bush and murder you. Or roll in behind your siege of an alb castle and wipe out your healers.  
---
Good times. Miss that game, wish it had been properly balanced.
---
Nah, there's just one dude at the top of the dps charts that gets most of the aggro. It's pretty obvious who needs that first heal by the third or fourth pull.
---
This is the result of everyone but maybe holy priests leveling as dps. 
---
You get a mage in the group?  Chances are he's probably frost blizzard.
---
and then a hunter rolls on a sword with no stats but on hit effect and you're back in the "no hunter" zone
---
&gt;Good type up, commendable effort all wasted again... what you are describing is an artificial intelligence not an automated process.
---
Self-regulated system without required a human is not Artificial Intelligence. It's the definition of automated, as per the linked dictionaries from earlier.
---
Artificial Intelligence is this:
---
Google - *"the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages."*
---
[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence) - a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers / the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior
---
[Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) - Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. 
---
[TechTarget](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence) - *"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. "*
---
It's safe to say that you don't know what artificial intelligence is. A self-regulating system not requiring human input doesn't mean the system is intelligent. It simply means it can continue on its own. Saying that I'm describing artificial intelligence is a huge mistake on your part, because yet again you ignore the actual definitions of things to suit your narrative.
---
&gt;This is the second time you have ignored someone pointing that fact out to you.
---
You have pointed out zero facts.
---
&gt;Your comprehension skills need to exist outside of 2 sentence snippets
---
Says the person who ignores every single definition *with sources* to suit his own narrative. At no point have you said anything correct regarding the usage of terms with automation, botting, and artificial intelligence.
---
note: actually grouping up with a mage as a druid is awesome. the druid can easily collect the mobs for the mage to freeze, then they can do a blizzard+hurricane combo to kill them extremely fast, and there's always bear+swipe form for any stragglers.
---
Yea, they tried 25 man to make it easier to form groups for raiding. 
---
But not in the same reply as the one they mentioned that only a small amount of people raided. That was strictly a statistic they brought up at blizzcon I think. Where they talked about which endgame content was the most popular.
---
But regardless, not everyone wants to raid, nor does everyone have to raid.
---
There are more to wow classic than just raiding. Thinking of only raiding is what caused wow to forget about professions and other content.
---
Edit: here is what I am talking about.
---
https://youtu.be/Falm0H7VEiQ
---
Timestamp around 4 minutes 
---
It's actually the oppsoite. The people that do raid are not a small minority according to these numbers. He didn't mention percentages, but it is a lot more than "the top %" (whatever yiu meant with that) that raided in vanilla.
---
Seriously?
---
Don’t feed the troll. Depending on how much time you spend on this sub you will see this person frequently and almost always negative or arguing. They are a sad human being.
---
Ya I've seen several vids where this isn't laggy so . Go make some more fake shit
---
More spawns there is a hill and a cave near.I was there recently and while there were ppl farming i managed to get tons of elementals and even stay farm em for money (full server)
---
enjoy never finding groups
---
cheers!
---
So *almost* a heal per minute, best case scenario 2 heals over the course of a boss fight (10, if you're healer group). Don't get me wrong, I love MST, but water is objectively the weakest totem
---
its still, "give me your shit or ill tattle on you to the server"
---
&gt;I'm still waiting for you to present an argument why is isn't a dumb choice to equip an item that you can sell for 100g, if you don't get near that much value of it compared to selling it and buying more applicable gear. It is dumb to choose an option that makes your character objectively worse off.
---
It's dumb to misuse a system.
---
&gt;And yes, saying that you are entitled to a 100g sellable item is at the expense of your party members. They each deserve 20g worth of equity from it through rolling, you are taking that away from all of them just because you believe you deserve it.
---
Nobody deserves equity of gold off an item. The roll is for the item, not for the gold.
---
How do they maintain a monopoly on the market? Does it have anything to do with government regulation? Or just naturally high entry costs into the market?
---
10 seconds of auto attack when you can feign or vanish to drop agro? wtf. I agree to start with SS or two and then slice and dice to start, but if you have to wait 10 seconds to deal real damage, you need to find a new guild because your tank is AWFUL.   
---
My guess is that the tanks didn't FAP when pulling giants (they stun), so dps couldn't go. Tell one of your tanks to go fury/prot and just wear high stam (valor)/hit gear, FAP, and just stand in defensive stand spaming bloodthirst/revenge/sunder/HS, agro won't be an issue. MC is in it's nerfed 1.12 state and items/talents are in their buffed 1.12, no reason not to just go ham in MC. Raids will get harder in AQ/Naxx, but thats a ways away.
---
its okay to be stupid but its not okay to be this proud of it
---
I can't help but smile every time someone pretends blacklists are a real thing.
---
There is like one Hunter needed per raid, yet about 12% play a hunter.
---
That was about as interesting as watching grass grow.
---
The group finder still exists. Only difference is you have to run to the instance.
---
Don't forget strength of earth! 1 warrior + 2 totems = 1.5 warriors. The end result is 6 warriors worth of damage in a 5 person party, and still enough mana to heal.
---
Btw why are there never news here for eu servers ? :-(
---
Both your gank and the follow-up gank (including rude emotes) seem like fair game on a PvP server. Is it butthurt-ness, or just PvP?
---
Anyone know a good, customizable combat text? I'd like to color my HoJ procs and sword spec procs differently from my other white hits and each other. No real reason other than my own satisfaction.

&gt;I really want to go through my comment history and necro those arguments
---
Did the ClassicLFG addon break Classic yet?
---
que? que paso?
---
That'd be like randomly hearing your dad yell "yolo!" or something lol
---
30h
---
God your so edgy, using insults online wow. Are all thiefs and cheats like this? If you want to get your epic mount  I would stop typing and start farming, Im sure you will get it eventually. Just be carefull not to steal or cheat anyone irl before you get the chance man! I know ethics are hard.
---
I can't control what other people play.
---
What's the game on the left?
---
Thank you for your service.
---
I think it's reliant on that spell being in your spellbook. If it's not, you get that question mark.
---
Yeah no I’ve healed both, the damage a 2H tank takes is far worse than occasional loss of aggro
---
If you want your group to follow specific loot rules other than just "roll need if you are going to equip" just say it at the start instead of waiting until an item drops. Having everyone on the same page about what the expectations are does a lot to prevent any drama.
---
My biggest worry seeing this is what's going to happen to TM vs SS when phase 2 launches... when honor ranks come out there will only be world pvp to get those ranks and that along with BRM is going to be a farm zone
---
The reason I don't play a tank in classic is because I tanked in vanilla. You're expected to know EVERYTHING, and to be good, you have to.
---
It was exhausting. I don't envy those who order actual troops around.
---
What can I say except you’re welcome
---
What fool. Devoting his  life, sleep ,stress to a video game.
---
Shadow priests no question. They have the least counters and no direct counter. Maybe rogues but dwarf priest abilities can counter them.
---
its sad people are eo greedy over pixels. this happened to someone in my group and we just rolled off for item after 3 greeded and 2 needed.
---
Hot damn, nice catch! I bet they were trying to list it for 30g and fudged the numbers. my only steal thus far has been the black tabby cat on the neutral AH for 5g. I remember seeing it for 100g back in the day, even on Horde side as only Horde can kill the mobs that drop it.
---
Nope, thats Not it. Turned it off nothing changed. Thanks though
---
You mean spam mage aoe and sappers. Jokes aside it is pretty dumb and i hope it gets fixed, its like this on retail too
---
Sorry for a dumb question, do they tank or just dps? I’m sure the damage has a lot of threat, just curious.
---
Thunder Bluff buff
---
All need, if you win give the noobie a chance to beat your roll for the item. Good enough for me.
---
&gt;Yours is someone who got his main, we all do that haha.
---
Speak for yourself.  I don't get my main if someone the same level as me kills me once, and I think it's pretty sad that you do.
---
Ew
---
Mate your art is always on point, great job!
---
If you're throttling your DPS when you're not at risk of dying to aggro or pulling the mob out of AoE/Cleave/Multitarget damage, you suck as DPS. If you're a warrior, you SHOULD be tanking to some extent if you're doing your job right, because you can hold aggro without dying (And then doing 0 DPS). If you're not Doing Damage, though (For example, holding back on DPS even though pulling aggro won't kill you or move the mob), you're not "DPSing".
---
The goal is to get through the dungeon as quickly as possible. The way you get through the dungeon is maximum DPS. You just have to prevent things that reduce DPS, like Dying, or Separating Mobs (Unless it's something like CCing to Prevent Dying), or Stopping Every Damn Pull To Drink.
---
It's interesting that you resorted to the, "if Blizzard wanted to," argument because later Blizzard changed it to where if you rolled need it became bound to you while greed allowed it to remain open-market sellable.  
---
By your own logic, you're violating Blizzard's design intentions. They haven't gone back to the game and changed that for Classic because they explicitly stated that they were not going to devote resources to figuring out and coding fixed/changes to this iteration of the game. The reason you can roll need on a BOE and sell it on the AH is because Blizzard hasn't coded that in even though that's how it's been in the game for a very long time. Once people recognize your flimsy argument that the only reason you can do what you're doing is because Blizzard doesn't want to code it in, even though they did historically and it's the way things currently function in the game.
---
Weird. Sorry, good luck!

I’ve seen worse from the high level alliance on my server.

Me (druid) and a friend (Warden) were able to lock down the Albion portal keep in our frontier for over an hour, killing every group who came out of it, even outnumbered 4:1 or 5:1 at times, just through coordination, good gameplay, and pvp healing (people hadn't figured out the power of healing in pvp yet at that point). It took them a whole raid of 40+ people to clear us out. Games where smart play can turn a regular player into a raid boss are what the gold standard should be.  
---
Of course DAOC had huge balance issues and some serious design problems (endurance buff + left axe, endurance buff + savage 4 proc multi hits), but it also had some amazing moments.
---
As a member of the Horde, I'd say an owl, because they're cool. Until you are high level enough to tame owls in winterspring, your only other option is to get one from Teldrassil, by braving the dreaded night elf capitol. Any true orc would of course do this at level 10.
---
Biggles its getting congested. The  Horde horde is growing by the day.
---
Well it’s not zero mana, but ya really easy to do as a priest or Druid. 
---
Shaman though? I fucking hate warlocks that refuse to eat or use 2 of the 6000 runecloth they get as a bandage. It would be fine if they were consistently in range of my chain heal, but that’s usually not the case. We don’t have a renew or quick cheap heal. And Shamans already struggle enough with mana as it is. 
---
There’s also a difference between life tapping from 100-1 expecting a healer to fully heal you , and life tapping when you need to for enough mana to finish a fight. 
---
If the healer is drinking, the warlock should not be life tapping away but drinking/eating as well.
---
Never said it wasn't "fair game," champ, just that logging your main after drying to someone your level is a little bitch move.
---
Gaming has been around since the 80s, it was not fringe in 2004.
---
Part of guild (pitter patter) a letter Kenny themed guild on bigglesworth horde side. Our tradition is when someone joins, or says afternoon we say "Howryanow". If we do a guild dungeon run we say," Time for chorin" when we start.
---
Update: i needed to track any faction repu to make the bar disappear. Thanks guys
---
Do you guys not like this idea?
---
Not to be negative but oh man I forgot how crap the druid set bonuses are.
---
It was a pretty epic fail of a comment to a group of hardcores that have been playing the franchise on PC since forever.
---
80 mana a minute assuming you are standing totally still either dictates really bad time to kill, or other large issues.
---
You couldn't "need" on any ole loot token, either!
---
Are these all pserver players coming over here with this corrosive culture?
---
It was bouncing between 550 and 650 on my server when I was looking to get one, but that price is completely unreasonable if the .5% drop rate from pservers is to be believed.
---
However it did take me nearly 22 hours of farming to get it, so who knows, might be much lower drop than that, but it could just have been me being unlucky.
---
"just tank with 2h, it's fine bro"

We press “F” or type “RIP” when someone leaves.

---
BGs will not be like retail.
---
Alliance always got absolutely steamrolled in vanilla and AV was also Horde controlled, always, just incase you were hoping for that one too.
---
When AV was intentionally changed to give Alliance an advantage, only then did they start winning, but that was a long time after vanilla and that version of AV tilted toward Alliances' favour is not the one coming in classic. 
---
So I'm not sure exactly what it is you're hoping for when the BGs are released? Shorter queue times maybe?
---
Alliance has FP struggles in Kalimdor and Horde has them in the Eastern Kingdoms. :)
---
&gt;Is the quest to kill the 40 elite for the WW axe doable at 30 with a level 30 priest there to help?
---
No, definitely not.
---
I personally used /who for alterac/arathi and offered high level players nearby money to help me with the quest. A friendly dwarf warrior ended up running over and doing it for free.
---
Get spy, it'll even play a sound when someone on your kos list pops up.
---
Need before greed doesn't really apply to BoEs, as outside of being an item that can be equipped they have a monetary value that can be leveraged. Anyone who shrugs and gives away a warden's staff to a druid because he can 'use it' is dumb as fuck.
---
You have to slam right after you swing because slam resets your swing timer.
---
and yeah, it is totally usable, but mobs that run are going to infuriate you
---
Purchase. Its specifically clear on that. Gold for gold is simply gifting. Scamming is ignored
---
Wow I was supposed to learn today but instead  i was reading your comment that was full of details and a thought our points discussing the topic.  Thanks for your well written response that wasn't personal or pissy at all.  
---
Ill try and learn it later though. First I need to finish grinding the last 50 plate pieces i need for my epic mount. I cant equip plate so its easy, I just get it while gearing/farming dungeons i was already running. Its literally the fastest way to progress my goals so theres nothing wrong with it. Thanks for the support.
---
World first pulling a grey nosehair while jumping on one leg and chewing tobacco.

Maybe stop. It's as lame as yelling world star.
---
I just put em on my ignore list
---
I respect the hustle.  Not sure if I’m going to 19 twins again this time or do another bracket.
---
Is it late 2019, lol
---
2h tanking is good at low level and tanking with 2 1h is good later. i dont know whats your problem tbh
---
If the goal is to get through the dungeon as absolutely quickly as possible, then just bring a bunch of mages and tell everyone else to fuck off.  If you want to be a ZOOMZOOMGOTTAGOFAST meta fuckboi then be my guest, but it's pretty irrelevant to the topic at hand.
---
Sweet Jesus, what’s that monster Golding Sulfuras??
---
Wait, you don't have a profession..?
---
*Boooooooooooooooooo*
---
Can one buy a practice lockbox from the AH and use it if they don’t have engineering as a profession?
---
Don’t get a laptop. Worst things to game on
---
Especially with that budget
---
Just because it's around doesn't mean it's not fringe. I think of fringe as in, most adults didn't play video games or at least admit they played. Today it's FAR more popular with adults because the kids who played video games all the time in the late 90s and early 00s are now adults. The OPs point is that the player base is far more experienced when it comes to video games in general and there's far more information out there about video games. Therefore, it's very easy to look up how to AoE farm.
---
Well either the item is reserved or they just don't invite people that can use that item.
---
I'd rather it be reserved.
---
You have a very reductive view of the game. There are too many situations to reduce down to what you are saying.
---
Do you have this without the level brackets/bosses listed?
---
 Every time I see a great world pvp video my brain queues up "Where Eagles Dare'

I've done something like this for ESO. I did 5% cut but only among guild mates.
---
Probably because it has such an immediate and strong meaning when read! No ambiguity there.
---
It might be okay but just fyi, bear form is strong as hell during 1x and your party speed might skyrocket if he gets it. Like the damage is unreal as soon as he gets it.
---
You aren't allowed to roll need on a trivial upgrade? An upgrade is an upgrade bro.
---
How many players does a realm have at full or high?
---
Whyyy i don't get it ?Mages do not out dps locks and stats are amazing for warlocks.. Don't tell me people prioritizing them cause of the name rofl ?
---
Damn. Never thought of this problem.
---
So is the person you're whispering here the one with the guild advert? If so they're obviously not experienced at all with wow if they don't know what stv is
---
Old Blanchy is pretty much dead anytime other than full peak. I think things dropped way more than they expected.
---
Bgs are xrealm. 
---
Y'all will get rekt cause worst case scenario for you is a fair fight, and every other fight is a outnumbered steam roll. :d
---
Broken tooth is basic. Everyone has one.
---
Yes, consistently high but never full.
---
Did they ever mention when they'll allow paid realm transfers?
---
Or in ashenvale it’s on the way to the azshara one. Dunno how he managed to get Felwood but miss ashenvale.

15 year old code.
---
Blue rares very often vendor for half as much as DE. Soulbound rare that DEs to a small radiant shard (2g) VS vendoring for 75s? Easy money. Use an add-on that tells you what you're going to get and that % chance. Many rares are 100% for a small radiant shard.
---
That hasn't been my experience, but I'm not max level so I could be wrong. When I went back to play BFA I literally couldn't play my mage anymore because I just don't have space on my keyboard for all the little one-off spells that proc. I honestly wish they'd just autocast when they proc or something so I don't have to have a button that I use maybe once a fight for a little extra damage (and if I ignore it I gimp my dps).
---
Big if tru

I'm getting flashbacks to pouring over the Atlas add-on, pretending to know where to go.

Rank 1, save mana and minimize their AP gain.

Nice.

I appreciate the Primo Victoria in the beginning

A BOE is worth exactly the same to everyone. Therefore, everyone needs it equally.
---
This is a fundamental law of BoEs.
---
Cool ty
---
The totem has a 30 yard range on it. You can move pretty far away before you lose the effect.
---
You can also use your 30 yard lightning bolt to pull mobs into the effect range.
---
If you are farming in a spot that has less than one enemy every 60 yards, then YOU are the idiot, not me.
---
There wasn’t 25 realms when name reservations were a thing.
---
Hi, this is amazing work!! Any chance of a version of this map without the flight path lines? I'd love to print the map with the town names and dungeon names. In my opinion, the flight path lines are a little too much for me.
---
MC is dead easy content, they simply had the organization to level quickly, efficiently, and collectively to pull off the world first MC run.
---
PvP is more about skill, which P server players have no advantage in compared to great retail players like Venruki or Cdew.
---
That just comes across as "Don't ninja unless it's worth a lot of money" tbh. That said, if your whole group is on the same page (ideally discussing what to do with BoEs before starting the run) then I honestly don't have a problem with it.
---
If on the other hand you join a group that specifically mentions loot rules that you don't agree with either follow those rules for the run or find a new group. 99% of loot drama comes from two things: not talking about loot rules and people being unwilling to find new groups if they don't like the loot rules for one they joined. If you decide mid run that a particular item should be exempted from the loot rules and just decide to ignore them: that makes you a ninja.
---
Sorry I was going to completely ignore what you said like you choose to do for my post, but Im busy finishing my epic mount.   
---
I only need 40 more plate pieces ! its easy because I cant equip it, and i was already gearing/farming these dungeons anyways! Its literally the fastest way to progress my goals so theres nothing wrong with it.    
---
This has always been the etiquette, you just have no manners and didnt know, I was also there.  It was alot more common to set loot rules at that point too.    
---
Thanks for all the support!
---
So you're level 46/47 fighting some 41s?
---
Wow I actually have this as a poster in my room, the only problem is I think it’s out of date or something because some of the flight paths aren’t there
---
Commenting to check later, as I have a similar situation. Learnt charge off a boar, have it in my list, but can't teach my bear. I had assumed it was because the Charge I learnt was rank 2 (which means I probs need to head to Westfall to tame a lower level boar for rank 1), but can't investigate until I get some playtime tonight.
---
$400 wtf...lmao.
---
So you’re saying you’ve literally never done it? I’m sorry if I don’t believe you 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
gotta be a dwarf priest for that fear ward xd welcome to classic!
---
I was going to put in the generalisation that Alliance are mostly full of immature angry raging kids and thus why they always lose at everything, but I'll just leave you to it.
---
Straight up incorrect. Check again.
---
they ganked me first while questing 6 of them 5 from olympus
---
Yeah uh... Private servers have been like that since ever.
---
#BOVINE FROM MULGORE
---
For shaman, melee you want a 2h.   Staff, mace, axe.   You can 1h with a shield but won't do equal DMG.   For that you can use daggers mace and axe.
---
If you want to cast.   You get a staff, dagger, mace or axe to boost into and later on spell DMG.
---
Wands are not available to shaman.
---
i hope he did haha
---
Run just east or Dalaran and swim the lake then run around undercity and poof.
---
It’s a lonnnnng way especially without the mount but I run up from Southshore, myself.
---
Obo
---
Right, but what's impressive about nuking someone 5 to 6 levels lower than you? Level is kind of important in this game.
---
Now I want some bitch potato home fries.
---
Make group,  Add guidlie,  Promote guidie/friend.   Log alt and add to group.  Promote alt to leader(remove guildie).  Now you can log to alt and reset the dung and do this till lockout.
---
I think it’s pretty terrible to roll Need on a BoE that you’re not going to use, with the exception that if you need it then put it up for the group to roll on, that’s okay.
---
Is it like a 15 minute walk or not so bad?
---
Well, when you say things like "then you would be the asshole here", implying theres only one, means that he would be in the wrong and be the asshole out of the interaction. While stealing skins is scummy and a piece of shit thing to do, threatening blacklisting is a step above that.
---
Who's on whitemane?
---
We've tested it with a rock and it sold instantly since it was listed for less than vendor. What are the chances someone was actually looking for that item and knew it vendors for more right away? I know there are add-ons, but for a rock? It's a bot.
---
5 casters and a warrior? 5 level difference doesnt make up for the fact that they are 5 more than me and have different cds
---
It's much more likely that they offered free transfers off the overpopulated servers, since, you know, that's exactly what they did.
---
Ok thank you
---
No it's not, not even close.
---
&gt;stigmatism 
---
Lmao
---
That is atrocious game design. Wow.
---
Pvp server EU ....maybe thats the case for US but balanced here
---
My fear is I walk the whole way trying to get a PUG and then it falls through and I'm stuck outside cold, lonely and far from home.
---
Really anything will run wow classic.
---
I'd say go for a ryzen apu based build for that price range.
---
For comparison my spare parts build I use for streaming in my living room has an e8400 dual core. And a 5770 1gb with 4 gigs of ram and runs classic at 80-100fps on classic graphics settings
---
Look up your pre raid bis list and start farming those dungeons. Even if you don't plan on raiding being in the best gear you can manage will help you quite a bit in other areas of the game. Start saving up gold for an epic, start training professions (especially if you're working with gathering skills instead of crafters, being at 59 will make it much easier to gather) work on attunement quests, start grinding timbermaw/frost wolf/ardent crusade rep.
---
You sound fun
---
I’m on the same server - but have never seen CHAD.
---
No dude, this guy is gonna tell you what you thought and felt as you played.
---
Azuregos and Kazzak drop some quality stuff and are cake to handle, always a fun time.
---
People are saying it's ok because he calmed down and apologized after that bs? Are you fucking joking?
---
That kind of behavior is a big thick yikes.
---
He should not play WoW and work on himself. I imagine people like this have WoW and its achievements as a replacement for life success. That's the only reason I could see a pet farming setback be that psychologically taxing. 
---
If I was his psychologist I would go a step further: force him to ninja loot as a pug in a guild raid or something equally douchey just so he could see the results of the worst blacklist in WoW womt affect his life that much.
---
Damn man those pictures just pissed me off
---
My main is level 26
---
I think the "intention" was always very clear back when I played vanilla. I don't recall if it was in tooltips, the manual, or just explained to me by other players because of the icons (Greed for gold, like it has gold on the icon).
---
What we're seeing now is 10 years of OTHER arguments having evolved into a new meta-"intention" if that makes sense.
---
If the greed/need choice is basically a prisoner's dilemma, then everyone clicking need is like [the strategy in this video](https://youtu.be/S0qjK3TWZE8)
---
It doesn't matter if it's an upgrade to someone. Really. It doesn't. Only BoPs matter for that, because they must be equipped and must be farmed in that instance. 
---
A warden staff is bis for my bear tank for the whole game, but if one drops I'm instructing everyone to roll need.
---
It's worth the same to everyone. I can buy it on the AH at any time. I'll hope I'll win a fair roll on another BOE that I'll sell.
---
The other method simply causes problems while providing zero advantages.
---
Had my first group where I could tell I wasnt getting any heal ups.  We were constantly pulling 5+ mobs without cc and no mage.  Basically turned pack clears of about 30s with me going ham and tapping, to pack clears of 60s with the tank now  requiring more healing because shit was dying slower. 
---
Healer didnt realize they just traded healing me a little to having to heal the tank a lot more, and doubling the dungeon time.
---
Items aren't sorted by cheapest buyout, it's cheapest bid. This results in pages of the non cheapest buyout being first in many cases. Add-ons bypass that page surfing.
---
On your tanks try to only PWS if you need to, say they got hit harder than you expected and you need to shield them and then flash heal. If you can just flash heal that's better. PWS is better used on yourself or other casters if aggro slips, because it prevents you from being interrupted, which could allow you to get a heal off on the tank and then yourself maybe before it pops.
---
This isn't retail. Go bitch on the retail sub.
---
Sorry about the double negative, but you're agreeing with me and i with you here.
---
dude calm down. the game is perfect, don't disturb the circlejerk!
---
Meanwhile, several MC runs and haven’t seen one Nightslayer pc.
---
Yet you pulled out your phpne opened camera app lined  it up and took the picture
---
All take more effort than pressing printscreen.
---
Dynamic respawn is based on population. Not how quickly you kill something.
---
Yeah I agree, however the map base map was already  in existence. I have simply highlighted areas and added a few things.
---
Get a lock to summon you. #locksrock
---
Hello,
---
New to WoW and I apologize if this has been answered.  I am a troll hunter, lvl 40 and I abandoned my pet for a new one today.  How do I teach it the stuff from the spell book? Do I need to earn training points again?
---
I'd probably be a little salty if I lost a need for a major upgrade to someone who only got a trivial upgrade, but not enough to blacklist them or anything.
---
That's just people being extremely desperate for tanks after all the warriors said no :p
---
And once he sales it...
---
 He can just contact Blizzard and get the account back. Does anyone purchase accounts this era?
---
Tailors can basically sell their 4 day moobcloth cooldown. I've been making ~4g a day by just putting my mooncloth on  AH
---
Looks like ElvUI and Grid.
---
What is it
---
It's not a flank if you go through the main entrance... but ok.
---
Home is where the hearthstone is, but I’ve been there... you’re not wrong.
---
So the hammer itself. He bought 8 sulfuron ingots by himself?
---
link it :) There's some number tresholds where below those numbers it isn't laggy. We had a 40v40 encounter that wasn't laggy. But this was 120+ vs 80
---
Inb4 the guys who play female, "i dont wanna look at a guys ass hurr durr!"
---
I have warriors and druids blowing my chat up offering 50g, and after a little research apparently this ring is verrrry good.
---
You're defense level is possibly 25 points higher (less if the warrior is prot spec) and you possibly have higher agility allowing you to dodge more.
---
Casters are squishy and pathetic if you close the gap and silence them.
---
Ok this I can answer, unfortunately only boars can learn charge. All the abilities bears/ different pets can learn can be found here:  [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=bear](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=bear)
---
Dude I love Sabaton, but that's just so wrong. I can think of tens of bands that were more frequent until the 2010s.
---
At least 1 copper
---
No changes damnit
---
They should bring back getting stuck in the looting animation too
---
So the dudes shitty toxic guild wont group with him anymore? The horror...
---
Dozens of us!
---
Definitely depends on the server but in a mature economy where everyone has epic mounts and spoiled alts are starting to come up, several hundred gold at least.  6 week old economy of today, I’d say at least 150g.  There’s not many rings before Molten Core that’ll approach this one, but when Dire Maul comes out that changes the math.
---
HoTs are the main reason you bring a *Resto* Druid. Innervate, Rebirth, and spot heals can come from any Druid.
---
And greed to use for an alt.
---
I know that MS Paint arrow! Finally, another player with class!
---
Honestly, they will just release WSG early because the dad gamers are complaining that they are getting corpsecamped everywhere, rather than fix this one problem.
---
Yeah don't sell that
---
Even as a rogue I had no issue getting SM groups. It’s even better to be there and messaging in /1 as they know you’re already there and don’t have to wait for someone to make the journey. 
---
If you don’t mind 1-2 corpse runs the WPL run is the fastest. Once you get past the bulwark you’re safe (unless you run in to some horde).
---
It vanilla it was common to set loot rules before the run. If everyone was unsure, it was discussed on drop. And if everyone greeded and someone needed, who wouldnt equip it, they were and are a ninja.
---
On the point of gear location. This all need mentality basically turns all epic BoEs into gold tokens. Setting aside my other problems with it, I think this goes against the spirit of a gear drop and how epic a drop is. I have nothing against the AH but its poor ethics.  
---
 No one wants to compare BoPs but I what if only need 40 more plate pieces  for my epic mount? its easy because I cant equip it, and i was already gearing/farming these dungeons anyways! Hell I could even get more value sometimes DEing it. Its literally the fastest way to progress my goals so theres nothing wrong with it?   I waste others time forcing them to farm for a progression barrier that wasnt in my way. The same etiquette applies.
---
Clearly 3 gold
---
Yes, so they get a complete poker hand
---
ayeeeee many of the tanks on my server are now selling their services for any dungeon that A) isn't a full guild group, or B) doesnt guarantee them an item. Guess I'm not wrong for selling my services, or are you about to tell me that every one of those tanks are also not doing their job by tanking dungeons for others? xD
---
I mean, if the lands are *this* bad already you don't really want to make it worse!
---
Oooh baby talk dirty to me you filthy little slut
---
Oh man, I really rustled you up.
---
Technically yes, check my main comment. There is a link to the original uploader and editor that has one none of my modifications. That’s the original Brady games version.
---
Yeah we type F when someone leaves and -F when someone joins
---
Well this doesn't include instances of which there are 6 currently:
---
1. ST
---
2. BRD
---
3. LBRS
---
4. UBRS
---
5. Scholo
---
6. Strath
---
And in Phase 2: DM
---
Plus the raids:
---
1. MC
---
2. Ony
---
Odds are Phase 2 will be fairly brief, since it is only adding the Honor System and Azuregos and Kazzak.
---
By Phase 3 you will have people in BG's (WSG and AV), and BWL as well.  Plus the darkmoon fair will be around.
---
So it isn't like everyone is truly consolidated to those zones, in fact an awful lot of time is spent not in those zones.
---
Gathering will be interesting with that many people though. There are A LOT more people on each server and that is gonna mess with the economy a fair bit.
---
Grats man, such a cool set!
---
It is like that for most people, but the elite hardcore WoW players have all been Ninja looted so they are trying to change the culture to do what they want to protect themselves.
---
And yet you all roll on the  gear anyway.
---
Its not the hunter  needs  the  gear  he just wants it.
---
It was stupid back then and it's stupid now.
---
The buying, not the selling, that is. If someone pays him $400 then he deserves the cash and they deserve to be out $400.
---
Dude..... its useless with this troll.
---
Yes, I added some flight paths cause a couple were missing.  I think they were added very late in the game.
---
Oh man, that blows! Thanks for coming back to me.
---
Arguing that the extra revenue didn’t cause the jump is almost as pointless as the opposite. Stocks are unpredictable and have so many variables. The news of the increased revenue could cause a mass buy. It’s definitely possible, any positive news definitely can cause a blip.
---
Yea it stinks but I think it more has to do with the servers working fine for 99.9% of cases so they don't want to spend for the .1% of cases.
---
Oh wow, actually saw you a few hours ago thats so nice!
---
I’d like to know as well. Only a few hundred gold off my epic mount.
---
I’ve had some success farming WPL with holy nova basically the same way as mages AOE farm
---
I just hit 40 on Kromcrush a couple days ago. I really haven’t had any issues outside of STV.
---
Just open up your pet training window. 
---
Each pet has its own training points, so you'll need to level them up.
---
If by one you mean three then you're totally right.
---
Hunter ring.
---
Add [] between the "/cast" and the spell name.
---
e.g.
---
```
---
/cast [] Charge
---
Hemo/CB is fucking terrible for dps.  If he's horde side there's no way to compensate for the talents you lose from the combat tree.
---
To get Hemo he spends 0 points in anything that increases his dps.  
---
He misses 5% hit, 50% increased offhand damage, 5% chance to proc a free mh hit, 5 weapon skill (3% hit, .5% reduced chance to be dodged, and ~15% more auto attack dmg), blade flurry (no cleave), and AR.
---
You can't "compensate" for that with gear because other ppl will have the gear too.
---
Instead he gets like 50% increased poison damage and a couple free crit eviscerates per fight.
---
Indeed, its in the works.  Thanks for the feedback.
---
This. These large scale battle look cool the first couple times you see them, but the mechanics are actually stupid boring, it's all about sending in a bunch of sappers.  
---
1v1s are way more interesting, like that prot warrior clip that was posted earlier where he noggenfogger slowfalls into the frostmaul area and ends up fighting a hunter for a vein.
---
Not from me. I be given the files to reddit so you may do as you wise. The large file I linked is decent enough for a large format print.
---
When I play my rogue I usually put the group together because I’m the least essential component, thus I’m the organizer.
---
Sweet - Remulos
---
Ur a clown
---
We're the Busch Light Slurpees and we say "Slurp" instead of almost everything else.
---
That was my guild mates whelping, he was so pissed. Meant to post for 30g not silver xD
---
Female orc warlock with a full Felheart set.
---
Are you me? My main is a female orc warlock! I collected the whole Felheart set a year or so ago. Very nice.
---
same as the druid quests...running around like crazy constantly
---
This. This. And more of this.
---
Aus Army here. I rely tenfold on the subbies who have a far better idea of the finer details 😂
---
What uni frame is that ? I like that one
---
Yeah this sub is honestly one of the biggest shitholes I've been in. Since launch I only skim through here once every few days now but it's just so much circlejerking and stupidity. Kind of a shame honestly
---
As a mage, I honestly don't see what the problem is?
---
Perhaps think of it in practical terms. That 250g could buy someone gear they CAN use that would be an upgrade.  In essence, the shadowfang is an upgrade.
---
The player who lost the roll can just as easily spend 250g on a shadowfang.  BOEs are not subject to dumb as shit "Morality" They are gold in item form that can be used to upgrade ANYONE's gear.
---
What are the three tanking classes for horde again?
---
I'm on a medium pop server, I'm gonna put in AH for 250g and see what happens
---
Depends on if he's a PvP spec or not.  It's far easier to keep it up w/ 30% duration and SS compared to no bonus duration and Hemo like most PvP builds.
---
Plays an mmo and is antisocial as fuck acting like a group invite is rape lol.
---
Calm down bro people like to play an mmo with other people...
---
Happened to my rogue alt many years ago. Was like winning a lottery of loot. Good times.
---
How are you referring to the two items?
---
I bet you're using their names. Try using their bag id instead of name.
---
I'm an H. pally :(
---
Dire Maul for that sweet Rod of Ogre Magi and Crystal Water for mages
---
Huh... Never thought of it that way but that actually makes perfect sense
---
They invited you twice get off your high horse lol
---
I am the lock :(
---
Those buns they make the women wear are hot
---
Not op and not saying you “faked” it because varying results is definitely plausible but here is a pretty large fight with almost no lag https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dcpl2b/when_wow_turned_into_a_lotr_battle_scene/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Varies per server. At the time that dropped to my party, I agreed to buy it for 75g because it was in AH for 150g when I lost greed roll. I believe that BoEs should be ffa roll. Anyway, I've since few times checked and price has been between 150-200g on my server. So I suspect it'll be 100g+ on your server too. As I suspect there were none in AH, it might be worth trying to sell it for 200g first.
---
Bro I havnt lost a BoE so go practice writing out your fantasies in your blog or diary. I'm really not intersted in your meltdown no matter how entitled or triggered your feeling okay. You actually have to pay a doctor for that problem, you cant cheat them though sorry.
---
I have to go farm some plate gold but goodluck on your first multiplayer game.
---
No, that Blue post was before launch.
---
Cool.
---
Plus, I’m sure all the chad chaddingtons at MCCC don’t even play wow 😚
---
Nah man its really just you .
---
Most people i meet will throw me an invite or i will invite them if we are doing the same quest  and usally theres no dramas no need for me to ask them for consent.
---
Its only you who needs a letter of consent before being invited LOL.
---
*waves from alt*
---
It's actually faster to stack spirit because so much of your DPS is based around your weapon. 
---
Every mob requires X number of weapon swings to be killed, the strength/agi required to reduce the total number of swings (2.7-3.2 seconds per swing) enough to even come close to how much time you save by just having on spirit gear is astronomical. 
---
Never having to sit down and eat will save you loads more time than killing a mob 1-2 weapon swings faster. Sure, if you could reduce mob kill time by 5-6 weapon swings you might end up breaking even on time to kill + resting time, but you're going to be hard pressed to have gear that good while leveling. 
---
Things change a bit when MS and BT are available, or if you have a partner. While leveling I switched between a full spirit set (90+ spirit) and some str/agi pieces based on the situation I was in.
---
Then you tank?  I don't get how I can make someone else play something they don't want to.  What a cycle of bullshit and toxic that would ensue.
---
Is it kind of shitty that this other player won't play the spec that you want him to play?  Yes, but it's a lot of me me me involved to trick another player into another spec.
---
It is, yes.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I don't know, 3 raid groups in this one and I see no lag.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dcpl2b/when_wow_turned_into_a_lotr_battle_scene/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
---
yeah. it's just slightly more convenient than combat log and /tar name
---
The targetting doesn't work if the person with Spy is in combat and the coords it gives are the coords of the Spy user NOT the enemy player.
---
As a gnome, gnomes are KOS
---
It's got to take a lot of strength to move those goalposts so far. You must hit the gym every day.
---
Classy, do you drop silk cloth?
---
Also known as: the literal definition of greed.
---
It's a bit concerning that you believe morality to be "shitty" though, lol.
---
Your professions are what make you gold, sort them out.
---
Operation Enduring Whelp
---
lmao imagine being so triggered you comment on every post someone makes. BECAUSE SOMEONE DOESNT AGRRE WITH YOU ONLINE LOOL.  
---
Its a big world out there, goodluck dude. Getting "entitled" tattoed on your face might help. This way people know they should just go away if they dont share your opinion.
---
UPDATE -&gt;bought him subscription and I deleted my 44 hunter on Stonespine and started from 0 on Shazzrah :)
---
Mez?
---
yeah had 0 trouble creating groups at 39, you're just fucking lazy
---
Wait... are you complaining about the removal of layers? Oh God, we’ve gone full circle.
---
So true. Then a enh shaman with rockbiter comes in and a hunter uses volley on the group of mobs X)
---
Why is someone wanting to upgrade their gear greed? You could just as easily say the other person wanting the blade to use is being greedy. Why is your point of view the only one that should be used?
---
I’ll one up and offer 4 gold for it
---
I see ravager drop every 2 runs, as a hunter, still haven't rolled on it, one warrior even said he was fine if I did, I was a bit like ehh I shouldn't be meleeing things anyway
---
Depends on the server really.
---
They dont know your done the quest.
---
The invite is sent out as an invitation you can say no.
---
I hate people like you fucking idiot yeah we should  all stop  and read  your  mind because how dare we send  you an invite after you finished the Q.
---
Just say "done but ty" and stop being a fairyqueen about it.
---
Don't give it a BO. Start it at 200g bid with no BO, then see what happens. It's definitely worth more than 250.
---
Alright at this point your just a salty PServer fanboy.
---
Cool
---
How do i open the high quality map on my phone(note9)?
---
An exclamation point appears instead.
---
Ty
---
Yes it is Mankrik's wife. But almost every Horde player remembers that.
---
Ah the hard life of a thief
---
Gotta burn the ships sometimes
---
Lbrs. You’ll be 60 in like 8 hours.
---
Hunter named "Onlymelee", huh? How's that working for you?
---
That just backs up my point. Finding people in the lower level areas shouldn't be based on if people are playing alts or not.
---
BO?
---
Let me know if you need an additional friend because I am in desperate need. I can’t get my friends to play this game whatsoever. Really bums me out.
---
i'm js man, this aint no 'battle' lol; took 2 guilds to kill afkers? cmonbruh
---
As an individual where this is my first experience ever playing WoW, what does this mean? ELI5
---
Thats the answer im looking for thanks!
---
Okay so a BoE blue mail chest dropped in Blackfathom Deeps recently, which was an upgrade for the tank so he needed on it and 3 others rolled greed. A mage who hadn't rolled yet got pissed that the tank needed instead of the group all rolling greed since "it's a BoE, that's what the culture is. You don't get to take it just because you can use it when you're gonna replace it with a green later."
---
So, which is it? I keep hearing both sides argued. Some people say everyone should roll the same on them for a chance at the gold, others say that if it's an upgrade for someone in the group then that person should obviously get it. That mage was pissed and ended up leaving group.
---
Awesome healers.
---
Yes, but you do carry 4 totems - can ditch ur hearthstone tho.
---
T2 levelers i believe. Simply enhance till 60 or respec at 40 to Ele.
---
Storm, Earth and Fire are our pets.
---
Most definitely, you can even heal in enhance gear really easy.
---
And they probably aren't even playing anymore. A nameless swarm of internet hivemind incels that move fleetingly from game to game.
---
Yes, and given all the problems it causes merging servers was a way word idea than having layering.
---
Got any screenshots of this happening? Seems pretty easy to report to blizz.
---
...Did you even read his post?
---
they should just restrict the free realm transfers to the higher populated faction.
---
Please express this opinion at the beginning of any dungeon you run so I'm never forced to play with you, please.
---
Are they earned at a faster rate? I hope it won't take as long as the first time training.
---
In dkp systems this type of thing happened. Some focused on set pieces as they weren't as fought over while some put 3 times the dkp on a single bis amu/ring/trinket/etc. So even if the raid had 2-3 warlocks, it could be that one fairly got to 8/8 while the other two didn't have more than 0-2 due to different priorities.
---
I assume youll know if/whenyou get your mageweave back
---
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
You're missing the part about BoEs being available all the time though...it has no more value now than it did to the wearer before running the instance. The only thing that's changed is now the wearer is richer than they otherwise would have been. This NOT the case for BoP. 
---
For example. Imagine a hypothetical scenario where the BiS gloves for a tank are an epic BoE that sell for around 200 gold. Tank 1 pays out of pocket to buy them on AH and equip himself to advance the guild. Tank 2 is stingy, and won't spend the money. Then on a raid, those same gloves drop. Does tank 2, who could have had them AT ANY POINT, save for their own stingyness deserve them more than tank 1 who can make their own money back? I'd say they both deserve a shot
---
Last ps guild I was in we'd all say Welcome when someone left the guild as well. 
---
It got to the point I had to make a macro.
---
They aren’t already on your server? They are on mine.
---
Where should I farm for the epic mount when the server is packed af? I don't get ores, I don't get Satyr kills, fishing is ok but it does not earn much these days
---
Even as a joke this is distasteful.
---
I'm not 60 and I haven't quit, am I never going to hit 60?
---
Yup, new generation of cringe gamers, ruining every game they come accross with low iq logic. These are the same people defending layering exploiters.
---
Can we turn EXP off already?  I was under the impression we couldn't
---
Damn dont overwork yourself dude. Gotta save some energy for stealing later.
---
You cant buy a cross faction mount unless you are exalted. I am assuming that is your plan since you asked about rep.
---
Buy out
---
Bro it's not that bad lmao
---
Ahhhhh yes. Needless wipes, especially in RFD/RFK without someone that can rez. That walk back to your corpse is the WORST.
---
Druids are amazing levelers and pvp class ,no1 can chase you down 1v1 if you do things right.Sounds like you just need experience with the class.Harder to play than most
---
I totally understand the mentality of wanting someone else to play something that benefits me, I used to be the guy that wanted everyone to play how I wanted the game to be, because me me me me me me.  That basically sums this shit up, and anyone that was once childish and always wanted their way would understand this.
---
I'll be keeping an eye out for that breastplate. Thanks for that.
---
Some people just don’t know how to have fun.
---
So....a Rogue?
---
Don't spam people after they said "no thanks"
---
I would take you.
---
It's happened every day for the last couple weeks. And I don't mean to random groups, I mean posts on this subforum. You're late to the party.
---
🤣🤣 Chad chaddingtons 🤣🤣
---
That's just fantastic hahaha. But definitely a valid statement.
---
Also it's the NCOs that Leroy shit. Our specialization is #teamwingit 🤙🏻
---
My computer experience doesn't influence my understanding of English vocabulary.
---
I'm curious. Have you ever taken an english class?
---
That life restructuring is a Yikes from me
---
I've seen a lot of people talks about it ruining the economy
---
Which I've yet to see play out lol
---
it doesn't matter what spec you are, you keep up slice and dice in dungeons. just don't waste cp on other finishers if it would cause snd to drop.  its pretty simple but many rogues seem to fail
---
Already added OP to my ignore list.
---
It was for my guilds first rag kill. Now it takes like 5 mins to put any new people in a good spot and a quick rundown of the fight and then he dies before submerge.
---
Yes. Also happy cake day.
---
Reverse that. He was the one who said NTY.
---
Eventually all phases will release, and then it is done.
---
Don't alliance have a flight point in booty Bay?
---
You could for alts
---
This is exactly what ruined LoL for me. Love the game, hate the playerbase.
---
Hoping Blizzard does the heavy lifting for me and releases a Switch or iOS version soon. I know there’s doubters, but blizzard can’t help themselves.
---
&gt;the skill needed for the game or the challenge presented by it
---
LOOOOOOOOOOL you're actually fucking trolling if you think classic has skill needed for it. I went into molten core fully expecting it to be completely brain dead and I was still taken by surprise at how fucking easy it was. When I was levelling I thought there was some magical point you reach where mobs start getting harder which is why people always talked about how tough the levelling was. Nope, it's as easy as it looks. 
---
Multiboxing just makes the game more convenient, I don't think making classic easier is actually possible
---
Don’t be sad, locks are awesome. However, it’s still the fastest way. Join a group with a second lock and have them summon you.
---
Probably TBC next unless they really wanna push things and do classic+(I doubt they would at least until wrath classic comes out).
---
When I'm solo grinding I only use 1-2 heals per minute anyways. So a free heal per minute is hugely significant.
---
What are all phases?
---
Oh, that's my bad
---
If the healer drinks as soon as you leave combat you have to wait, if he drinks when you’re about to pull he can drink while the pull starts. ALSO if the healer has to constantly drink either you are not geared/leveled enough as a tank or the dps are idiots (usually the 2nd) mana doesn’t just magically disappear.
---
I can't open it on my chromebook with 4gb of ram, it runs out of memory.
---
The person with the stat upgrade helps every player they play with during the time they have the weapon if youre gonna play it that way but its not really the point
---
Coming back to Blaumeux? 
---
I hope you do, it’s a great server! 
---
I logged on tonight and for the first time I saw it say “full”. No que still, but I think it’s popularity is growing
---
Soy un idiota
---
I actually woke up early one day before work at like 5 am to get that quest done. Had almost all of them to myself
---
You don't even have a point lol. You sound like some butthurt kid that got shit on by a MB'er.
---
... There's a boat in Feralas?
---
Not its the not for example the rogue cant use the BoE staff that just dropped.
---
So how is him selling it more of a windfall than a caster using it as an upgrade.
---
Just an example... BTW if somone in your group fan use the BoE as an upgrade they should get it.
---
Its a dick move for 4 people to need and sell the item over the 1 guy who actually needs it.
---
Well, I better hurry and get to 60 before everyone starts farming me for Honor.
---
Go find where I said it was ;). 
---
We are not a hivemind mate
---
Everyone seems to be able to send bnet requests even for randoms
---
This helped so much!!! Kiting wide is essential.
---
I was able to manage her several times without improved aspect with this tip
---
That was some Battle of the Bastards shit if I've ever seen it.
---
200 posts crying about losing an item in a video game?
---
Everyone is is melting down reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
To lazy to get the rest of the text but comes to reddit to ask this...if you cared enough you would find the rest of the conversation and send it in for proof.
---
I don't think anyone much cares
---
Hey could you not make memes so relevant to my personal experiences? It's weirding me out.
---
At some point it’s yours if you edited it enough.
---
Spirit int considering it will give u dmg and reg = less downtime and faster leveling
---
Yes, from the forgotten coast to Feathermoon Stronghold.
---
On my server it would have been the opposite. Gandling-EU is full of assholes who play alliance. Not to say that all allys are assholes, but on my server they are. Constantly getting ganked by lvl 60s in horde territory. They even go so far as to kill horde quest mobs over and over again just so you can't progress.
---
Oh hey thanks I was looking for my combat log.
---
Haha. They cannot even spell realize.
---
You lost out on a hundred gold or more to let your guild mates know to blacklist this asshole. Eventually the assholes have no one else to raid with besides each other
---
no, I would prefer to play on classic for the next few years. I'm just predicting that it's gonna happen.
---
I feel you. My entire bank is filled with meat. My cooking is 225, but I'm too low to complete the artisan cooking quest, and I want to save it for skill-ups.
---
Martha!
---
Seems insane to have 4months of no BG's after the honor system releases. They're going to kill off a lot of casual players doing that because people aren't going to deal with being camped at a flight path for 4months
---
Look for non quest mobs to grind on
---
Wthats wrong there ? Moo as a cow and Lester as favourite football team
---
A warlock will spend more time farming soulshards so they can use their abilities to help the group over the course of their classic career than a rogue will spend levelling lockpicking. 
---
A warrior has to level up their weapon skill. They level with 2H normally so 1h levelling to tank for you is time they’ve spent just getting ready to tank the dungeon. They also have to spend time farming gold to pay for extra repair costs that you don’t.
---
A healer without a mage in the group spent time farming gold to buy water to keep things moving. 
---
A hunter spent time farming gold to buy food for their pet and bought ammo to be an effective party member. 
---
Everyone pays their class tax in one way or another. 
---
If you get summoned to the instance, the healer buffs you up and drinks when they need to, the hunter has their pet at full happiness and bags fully stocked with arrows and food, and the warrior has 100% armor durability and capped weapon skill, you’re an absolute dick if you don’t unlock the chests for the group. 
---
Lockpicking is a rogue ability. It’s not a profession, it’s a niche rpg element that you can use to help your group and thank them for the time that they spent to be a good teammate for you.
---
A love that a whole other raid group joins from the other side.
---
dont think you know what youre talking about mate.
---
Yes, this is a joke.
---
I farm herbs and dungeons for runecloth or other things, stonescale eels with fishing and sell transmute CD when its available. It's not much but I'm sitting on 491g at level 58. I've learned all my skills from trainers, but avoided buying items or recipes. I also have stashed away some items like swiftthisle and wicked claws for when they become more expensive.
---
Now they need to take care of the multiboxers
---
I'm pissed I can't do this.
---
and theres a fuck ton of others not helpin as much as they could if youre whole raid is failing.   
---
Maybe that player sucks at his role but its clearly doable. XD Sounds like just making excuse for a bad raid.
---
Make friends with alliance players who like to pvp and let them know there are some juicy bags of fun hanging around where you are.
---
Responding to help you remember!
---
I totally get you on choosing the name. On my main it took me about a month to finally decide on one that would stick with me for probably years to come. But in this case it's just a rouge alt that I'm going to fully embrace the pvp fuckery that is a rouge so I needed a fuckery name. And buttsack was something a friend of mine called someone when he was pissed, and it just stuck as a funny name to call someone.
---
I second this question
---
Just don't be lazy and tank. We have enough dps classes we don't need warrior dps
---
I mean it takes way more time investment, commitment, and co ordination with organized premades. I’d say that’s harder than clearing bwl.
---
What's the addon for those loot roll frames?
---
5 alliance can easily take out a higher LVL player. My friend and I(both LVL 52) took out a 60 priest last night.
---
Need to spend a ton of gold to level them up or spend a ton of time on farming it, def the right option but thought i could just grind somewhere here and there, that plus some quests and green/blues from dungeons should get mW there in 2-3 weeks
---
Had a player do this with a low lvl blue drop.
---
We are both grouped doing a quest blue chest drops and its a nice big upgrade for both of us .
---
He wins it i say GZ man and he turns around and says do you mind if i auction this for 2-3 gold somone will buy it.
---
I sat there thinking wtf i can use that upgrade aswell hell he could even use it.
---
So i said to the guy i rather he atleast equip it or trade it to me if hes just going to sell it.
---
Some people are goblins....
---
There is literally, absolutly literally nothing in the world lowest than people corpse camping who get mad when other people get involved to kick their ass
---
Always all need BoE and if you win, and someone is butthurt, offer them the piece if their greed roll beat your winning roll. Simple as that
---
The guy doesn’t know what he wants.
---
OP don’t make the mistake 99/100 people do when envisioning how a laptop will serve their needs. Get a desktop.
---
Did the interviewer ask how many players they are allowing on a single layer?
---
That is the burning question!
---
Because they are pretty easy to do and have their own audiences. After the easier stuff then they can work on new stuff they were going to do back then.
---
Did not know that, thanks!
---
Shadow priests thrive on survivability for a clothie. Shadowform and stacking stamina is essential for a PvP Shadow Priest.
---
The spec you posted is like what you’re doing for PvE...silence+shadow weaving with points in healing...ya maybe that’s pretty good with a squad of like 8 warlocks but outside that it looks really weak.
---
You just simply won’t be in a good spec one way or the other. Either you shadowweave heal for PvE and have a crap PvP spec, or go full shadow and pull mediocre-bad Dps and heals for PvE and be a god in PvP
---
It sounds weird and socially awkward, but always state the trade that is about to take place in chat (unless you trust the person implicitly) ie. "So my 60 mageweave cloth and 6 silk for x of your mageweave bags?"  
---
If he replies yes to this, and you trade him the goods, a sort of binding agreement has been made and he is 100% sure to get punished if he decides to run off with your stuff. Unless you don't report him for it of course.  
---
If you don't state the trade, you're shit outta luck.  
---
Chats are logged, so you don't have to provide screenshots.
---
Was all focused on leveling, thought about going skinning before since its very smooth but got completely lost in the leveling, close to 250 first aid atleast
---
Complete with Epic Music as it should be. =)
---
Must be nice but most people  learn life aint that happy and fair.
---
People will walk over you with that attitude.
---
Why does everyone hate layering?
---
Interviewers never ask the actual questions that we want answered.
---
There is a huge problem with that "someones upgrade" bullshit. Because this favors players geared with garbage to get all the loot because everything is upgrade for them against others who spend their hard earned gold on gear! Also you can abuse this just by changing to garbage set before joining dungeon to make EVERYTHING an upgrade for you! So yes there are no doubts about "Need all Boe" becoming default rules its just a matter of time when everyone will realise it.
---
I'm just going to repeat the arguments I made before that you decided to ignore. 
---
Pretty much every piece of software that you write is going to run smoother/faster in the future. Yet I think we can agree that not every single piece of software can be considered 'ahead of the times'. That would make the phrase meaningless if everything qualified.
---
If you think "I wrote this brute-force algorithm that solves the traveling salesmen problem! It runs like shit, but in 10 years it will run a bit faster! I'm ahead of the times!" is a sensible statement and proves your point then I'm perplexed. That phrase would make any software developer I have ever met laugh.
---
People always want to give this shitty advice when they're on the upper end of the 90:10 server.
---
This pleases the ATVI shareholder
---
If you are a warlock, necrosis has dot timers built in along with a ton of other useful warlock features.
---
Almost thought this was the start to a porn clip
---
He is literally saying preferably a laptop. He didn’t ask people their opinion on desktop vs laptop lol. I play on both and it’s situational which I use. Both have their pros and cons. Maybe op wants to chill in a lazy boy recliner and play wow on a laptop.
---
Ok I need to clarify here. That raid that is running in is the non-raiding part of the &lt;Progress&gt; raid in the video I linked. After they were helping protect the raid's buffs in the massive 200+ person pvp they went of to have fun at Kargath since they weren't raiding.   
---
So on the initial charge it's maybe 40 vs 80 (with a decent amt of afkers) and by the time &lt;MAXIMA&gt; shows up there's maybe 20 people alive, making it a 80 vs 20.   
---
At no point is there more than 120 active people.   
---
above clip it's atleast 120 vs 79 (we have some screenshots of 135+ people, but lowballing) who are all activelly casting spells, moving etc. 
---
So objectively my clip above has around 2x the ammount of active participants.
---
I'm so jelly. I need that staff, but it's just out of the question for a while!
---
Been looking for this addon too...
---
We ‘Knights Who Say Ni’ always should Ni! When everyone joings the guild or comes online. It makes great banter if you know Monty Python and the Holy Grail
---
The real purpose of tanks are to take damage so that the healer doesn't. If the tank is accomplishing that with a 2h then job done. Is the healer ooming after every single trash pull? Problem. Is the healer actually healing the entire fight instead of idling/dpsing? No problem.
---
If you like both pvp and pve realms the obvious solution is to roll Horde on a severely imbalanced pvp server. Skeram is very Horde dominated. Then you can pvp once in a while when you find the occasional Alliance toon out in the world but mostly it's just pve.
---
Though the pop is pretty high so while there are no queues you will face competition from your fellow Hordies for quest mobs and such.
---
So I'll just start needing on everything unless my entire party pays me not to. That makes sense, right?
---
nah you just need to stop bitching
---
[Please see the OP's comment here for an **UPDATED** image.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dcu95i/one_map_to_rule_them_all_one_map_to_find_them_one/f2bbq2v/)

SUF is buggy for me, slow to update missing health, expired debufs,etc

Trigger warning
---
You dont .
---
But at the same time all those things you said is infinitely less annoying than a fuckwit needing on it just to sell on AH.
---
If you cant equip it dont roll need thats my thoughts ..
---
You need an item you cant equip and sell it  how the fuck is that not ninja looting anyway ?
---
All these poeople saying it stops ninja looting when its really just another form of ninja looting.
---
"Weird macro" lol

I play on Trollbane (pve) and since they introduced War Mode it's turned into huge battles/world pvp. I play  on a  PvP server on classic and it feels exactly the same, lol.
---
I thought it was gonna be the tiger or smth
---
Lol can't have good servers now, that would cut into precious profit margins
---
This feels similar to the scenario where a 40 toon multiboxer would go into Warspear and pop all his toys to lag everyone out while he casted aoe.
---
Everyone is saying shit GM, and while I agree he shouldn’t micromanage guide chat, I think it’s somewhat honorable that he’s trying to get people to join discord and chat. Unless he’s doing it for his own agenda then that’s lame.
---
Watch everything from nobbel87 on yt
---
I remember people used to ask "does anyone need?" And if everyone said no we would just all need. So i dont think much has changed. 
---
But there is definitely less repercussions for ninja'ing without a dedicated community forum, the censorship of public blacklisting and the age of baby talk on online games.
---
Is this true? I’m a level 43 elemental and lately I have been regretting rolling a Shaman.
---
Yeah, I've actually just had a real hard time earlier got it to finally work by buying "Game Time" rather than a subscription. It's basically the same except instead of auto-renewing it every month, 3 months or 6 months it's a 1 time purchase, so I'll have to do the same again later on.
---
Uh no? People don't want to get to shitty retail. That's the whole point of classic. You rush this, next thing you know we are at cataclysm and wow dies again.
---
What were you suppose to learn from Leeroy?
---
cominginhot baby.
---
It's one of those things that if you have to ask about it, you're not in a guild where the point you made matters. Which is why it's such cancer to the scene. I get min/max happens with players and guilds, but there is way too much of the playerbase chasing it when they don't even comprehend why the BIS gear list they are chasing is BIS.
---
&gt; Why is your point of view the only one that should be used?
---
T his is the point of view of blizzard. As of patch 4.2 rolling need makes an item BoP. Need system is intended for people who want to use item. Case closed
---
I very seriously considered using wow as a speaking point for NCOA, but I didn’t want to out myself. 
---
Then again, my raid guild in legion was entirely made up of guys from my unit so...
---
no
---
NCOA?
---
That's simply not true. We've been single digit number of layers since at least Sept 5. [Here's](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/layer-switching-is-the-problem-not-layering-itself/286941/19) a blue post about it.
---
Look at you trying to look smart. Okay. Lets dumb it down even more for you.
---
Yes. Give the other warrior a free 500+ gold item for running the same dungeon as me. He clearly deserves the 500+ gold more than I do because I already spent 500+ gold on said item. Clearly because he has more overall gold to spend on items before he is fully geared, he deserves 500+ gold more than I do for doing the exact same work I do in a dungeon.
---
See the parallels? Of course you don't.
---
Both the warriors are doing DPS -&gt; Both of you are working the same job.
---
Warrior A needs to spend (X - Edgemasters) on gear to be fully equiped, Warrior B needs to spend X -&gt; You live in a $500 apartment, He lives in a $1000 apartment
---
Instead of you taking home $750 and him taking home $750, you decide to not be "selfish", and give him $250 of your paycheck so he can pay for his $1000 a month home, and you can still pay for your $500.
---
How about you stop being selfish and pay for your co-workers mortgage since you don't need all the money?
---
Feel better?
---
Or I would say all need and everyone would say ok because no one wants to just pass that much gold to a random pug member.
---
There's not that much leather out there with enough str to make it worthwhile.  A lot of it that does have str also has junk stats for war like int or spirit.
---
Europeans tend to use the S instead of the Z. Both are acceptable.
---
3% difference.
---
It is but they want to sexure the item because rhere greedy.
---
Its the same as ninja looting to me and it makes me laugh  to see all these cunts try to justify there greediness .
---
I main warlock and sometimes when i get low by tapping and tank is also low like if a pull goes wrong etc, i tell priest focus healing on tank, i ss priest and continue pumping my last mana/life and sometimes end up dying, but my repairs are cheaper and if the tank dies we all do so the math is quite simple imo.
---
NCO Academy, AF E6 PME. 
---
I’m enlisted scum.
---
&gt; As of patch 4.2
---
Good thing classic is well before 4.2
---
The intended use and same as in my experience, but judging by the comments the P-servers/streamer/hardcore culture is very different to the game you or I play.
---
I think Rogue should share the spoils of war. Yeah they had to level lockpicking (probably just spamming trade to do it for tips) but they depend on the group to get them to the chest. No free rides, Rogue friend. 
---
That being said, I honestly don't care about loot before end-game. If you have to have this fight over and over again for what? Some bolts of silk and free water? Yeah sometimes there's something juicy and you could make some mount money, but honestly it's so much easier to just get the dungeon done, get those quests done, and get back out in the world where you're in control of how and when you get your money. 
---
Also, at max level, your friend list actually comes in handy because you won't end up being too far apart level wise. You find people you trust/like and you farm gear/drops/money/etc with them. Fuck those greedy pricks, you got homies now.
---
There's gold in them there ponds.
---
I like trying to do the same thing for half an hour with no visible progress.
---
Now delete this orc and reroll undead cos no one has stuns at lvl 10
---
Probably the single greatest thing I’ve seen in a while. Sadly I was on the other end.
---
Why do you think everything is on reserve and asking for "ranged dps"? All the tanks are gathering DPS gear.
---
Holy mother of high res maps
---
I figured it out! It's Omni CC and classic aura durations. Need both to make it work.
---
Wow grats man that’s excellent! It was selling for roughly 225-250 on my server today.
---
Okay so you agree with me?
---
Nobody actually needs boe items or crafted gear or mounts or anything like that?
---
In which case nobody should be needing, which further means that since no one person should be needing, everyone should just need so ninjas can't ninja.
---
So its good to agree.
---
Just go level it up. It takes 10 minutes of fighting mobs spamming hamstring or rend.
---
I dont really wait out the timer. When something like this drops I just say "Everyone need".
---
Noway was there only 2 or 3 layers at the start.
---
Because he can equip the item and you cant .
---
Its really rather simple.
---
Im going to start rolling need on BoP items for the vendor price with your logic..
---
WHY DO YOU NEED THAT UPGRADE I COULD USE THE 50G VENDOR PRICE"
---
Fucking retard honestly how can you not get that need means you can use the item greed means you want to sell it.
---
Greed has meant you wants to sell the item always and need is for needing..
---
but you’re in the AF. I think I picked the wrong branch 😒
---
Report the ninja, save their name, if they dont get banned, band together with other jilted players and brigade Blizzard and donate money to that hacker kid from a few weeks back. You know his bail fund is going to be very high. I am sure it will be effective.
---
Sadly, because people have the perception that Blizzard doesn't punish toxic players that always roll need, we now have semi-nornal people also declaring that everyone should roll need to combat the loot ninjas. 
---
To me, it just seems like Blizzard dropped the ball years ago by not outright banning bad, toxic players because they wanted that sweet monthly sub money. Instead, they just send canned responses and how for privacy reasons they can't say what actions they took. 
---
Blizzard, you aren't giving me any personal information by telling me that LoOtNiNjA was banned. You didn't tell me his name or his SSN or password. You caused this crisis by not acting against it, and everyone suffered. You mashed multiple servers together  so we couldn't even warn others LFG on our server to avoid them in retail, and here we are back at square one in Classic. Even this mindset of the playerbase shifting toward this "solution" is sad, but understandable and inevitable. It sucks, tbh.
---
Alchemy is too expensive to be useful without hours farming every day
---
You're sacrificing spellpower for survivability (int/stam/FR [int is survivability for locks because you tap less]) in this case. The only except would be the hit on gear, which I would argue is more important than any amount of spellpower for a warlock in the current phase. 
---
This all depends on the guild you're in too. For turbo nerd guilds, spell power and max hit for a lock will trump survivability, but if you're in a guild who's naturally progressing and hasn't seen the content then the survivability is actually stronger.
---
Rather play the game than wait for content in a sub game. No reason honor and bgs should not be in the game now
---
Just run from Southshore and hop over the island in the lorderan lake.

You could go to chillwind camp in WPL then run back into Alterac and follow the mountains west along there.

No. I word for word wrote down what you stated and asked you to elaborate. You may have felt like I was trying to string you up but that wasn’t my intention. You said that if you give a shit about doing any dmg that wasn’t the spec to use, I asked you to point out your preferred spec for maximum dmg. While I’ve played this game far too much, I won’t pretend to know everything about it so when someone says this is better I’m interested to know why they think that so I can make my own decision. That’s how you learn.

Kind of why I don't post pictures, but really all I'm saying is why do people have to say this everytime someone posts cell phone pictures..... does it really matter... not really. I'm sure people know that its not as good as a screenshot.
---
Why are you telling me that, instead of the guy I replied to?
---
Seems like a better answer to his comment:
---
&gt;That's bollox, mate. If the boss has a loot table in a dungeon, and the group announcement says "LFM need healer for BRD"(or whatever your flavor), then that boss is at least attempted, time allowing  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\[...\]  
---
&gt;A dungeon run, unless specified otherwise, is exactly that. You start at the beginning and kill until the end, or until you wipe enough to call it.
---
yeah but since other people allready fill the 1/40 hunter quota, why did you pick one? How are you so selfish?
---
the game wasnt complete in classic so you cant judge intentions of the devs solely by what was in there. fact they changed it later on shows what it was intended for
---
Shhhh
---
People keep saying this, but what is bad about merging? I cant think of anything. A dead server has no community so you can't say it messes up the community.
---
Thanks for the service, Captain. Doing us nerds and the country proud.
---
My paladin on the other hand. "Top that off, this is eas--EVERYONE IS DYING, BALANCE THE HEALTH BARS", followed by "Mage used full combo? Guess I can save mana"
---
Exactly why this pisses me off so much.
---
Your ruining the fun of the game some people  like rolling on an epic BoE thats a huge upgrade.
---
If i had to kill bosses recieve gold/tokens and buy gear off the AH i would not play this game.
---
Where the hell is the fun in that ?
---
And you could apply the same logic to BoP it has a vendor price ..
---
then you will be ignored and not invited to further groups and prob kicked but sure
---
Those sounds around 40 seconds sound like that video of that British kid punching his wall over call of duty

lol called you out eh its a 15 yr old game stop being a greedy loser over ot lmaooo
---
Rogues I went with rolled greed. Rogues are there to give their abilities to the group.
---
I'd prefer a bit of an edge if any, but not super dominated. I dunno.   
---
I do prefer horde a bit, because I spent so many years playing Alliance (But originally was horde), so it's more fresh for me.   
---
Also, wonder why this got downvoted? lol
---
That’s your name?
---
Edit: cominginhot &lt;—- is that you haha
---
It's not that you even want it for DPS spec only, but a lot of DPS gear is really strong for keeping threat which is arguably the most important thing for a tank to have. More threat = more ham. I get where you're coming from though but you should probably just always have it in the back of your mind, some tanks are kind enough to give important DPS gear to the DPS if they really need it and some are not. It all depends.

I play on Herod as Horde, an EST server. Between 5am-8am there’s almost no one online doing much. You can’t do any group content really, so the 1-2 nights a week that I play at that time, I farm. 
---
I’ve done /who on Ungoro and seen 15 people there, once there were only 2 people in the badlands.

Playing at a more popular time, questing and group content is likely more consistent and fun then farming.

Phase 2 with Dire Maul East gets a lot better for Priests, especially with mining/herb. You can farm easily as a holy priest there.

If you don't want PvP don't roll on a PvP server. I play horde and I've been ganked by Ally's countless times it's just part of the game, deal with it.
---
&gt; Doesn’t understand basic economics, and how a BIS item for a mage has identical value to a rogue thanks to the Auction House? Check.
---
The amount of people who don't understand this is astounding.
---
Westfall?
---
Why didn’t they include bgs in the release? Why are they waiting to drop them?
---
When the boe bow drops you can be the only one to roll aswell.
---
You can apply your logic to BoP items... .
---
 Why do you need that BoP upgrade when i could easilly use the vendor price .
---
Thats how silly you sound to most people ^^^
---
Yeah mashing it definitely works but I end up de-targeting it and with the game menu open haha. I think spamming a macro instead might be the key to solving this.
---
Sounds like a bug
---
I mean every group I've been in have all agreed to roll need on BoE's worth cash regardless if someone could use it or not, it's worth a ton of money.  It's just the smart way to handle it since it just stops ninja looters.

Yeah if you choose to ignore all the replies from people disagreeing with you then you must be correct. I can guarantee that not everyone who disagrees with you is a cheater even though you seem to think they are. I can’t guarantee none of them cheat, but I know that I’m  no multiboxer, I’m a 1 click = 1 action kinda guy but I still completely disagree with your stance. I do agree Multi boxing isn’t fair and it shouldn’t be in the game. It’s not botting though and unless they change their EULA or ToS it doesn’t even appear to be against the rules unfortunately.
---
I'd be stoked to have a map like this (or this one) where the flight paths are just shown as the faction-colored dots without all the stripes everywhere. (boat lines stay ofc)

Not enough rage.

God, as an alliance I'm sorry. These guys sound like jackasses

Are you using any shortcuts? If I’m holding control and heal it heals me instead of target.
---
Out of curiosity, what was the take back from this? I can guess but I'd like to know why they actually used that clip.
---
was this on whitemane? someone in my guild was talking about this
---
&gt;before or after =/= on

Dude warrior dps pre raid BiS is mostly leather...

Nope noooo shortcuts honestly? I click my target and use my F G T keys to heal. And I’m 100% of what target I’m picking

These people are idiots, blizzard said they were going to remove layers and even said "there will not be any layers by phase 2" wtf.  Glad this post happened and kind of wish i had saved every moron who claimed layer was staying so i could tag them all in this.

That was supposed to be an inside joke lol the real reason I left is because there were 200 million mages in all my aoe farming spots

Yes, you are. You are having the conversation you want to have, not the one they are having. You're just being stubborn.

---
I want to say that blizz said that phase 1 was going to be the longest phase and that phase 2 will probably be about 3-4 months long just so everyone can catch up for BWL/BG's. With only WPvP for honor farming, the rank system will take about 2-3 months for the most dedicated to reach R12+. 
---
As for casual players a lot of them are not even level 60 yet and will still take about another month to hit 60 and then they start the MC/Ony gearing in prep for world pvp. If phase 2 hits late 2019 so november/december in time for winter break you can imagine phase 3 would hit sometime by end of february/march which isn't too bad of a timetable.
---
"classic gonna last forever you guys, classic better than dumb dumb retail, can't wait till they add more layers/servers, classic won't be dead in three months you retard...sh-shutup!" I could go on with the laundry list of hate and bad arguments everyone made when I said servers are eventually going to get merged.
---
Since there aren’t a lot of high end Druid pvp players the info can be hard to find.  But after doing my own research ( level 60 Druid btw ) what is best in slot for that particular build is wildly different depending on player meaning your free to mix and match and find what fits your play style best, this is what makes druids so fun to pvp with.
---
They did all agree on one thing tho regardless of build
---
Number one: Stam 
---
Number two: int
---
pretty sure that doesn't work unless they are on the mob's aggro table
---
The same goes for real life fishing! Except I usually got a cooler of cold Busch Light with me.
---
And retail servers die with more than 5 players in a 10 mile radius
---
Wait what ...
---
Your saying you prefer to buy upgrade  from AH compared to dropping it from the boss  and winning the roll?
---
Thats the oppposite of most people.
---
Your playing the wrong game btw , no im serious bro theres alot of games that focus on that kind of gameplay more like Black desert online.
---
Games where you can  buy the best armour of the AH and never need to raid you just need to farm gold.
---
Thats not wow ... wow is about getting  that epic drop and adrenaline rush as you press need.
---
New raid with no attempts on the boss is perfectly reasonable, later on ull be clearing mc in 1-2 hours total tho.
---
Tactics should always be discussed BEFORE buffing though, never buff until everyones ready, thisll save you money when someone accidentaly pulls rag with their pet ;)
---
Omg i have walked into BlackRock mountain so many times and seen so many skeletons.  I smile every time.
---
Why? Over the course of a few high level dungeons every bop that drops quickly adds up to 50+ gold. I worked equally hard for that, why should you get priority just because you'll get a few more stats vs me getting a few more gold.

If you ever checked out FFXIV, that game has support for playing sounds *in other people's client* so you can put in a chat macro that plays a mishmash melody from the available sound bank and they'll hear it, kinda funny.

First time it happened to me I was in the linkshell (kinda like guild chat) and asked why I kept hearing a bunch of loud drums while fishing.
---
Yes. RS revolutionized the genre and was as popular as WoW. It also launched expansions that grew to almost twice the user count of the original game when it transitioned. Both games also have their mainline/original still being developed with their respective companies being in similar financial situations. The playerbases also campaigned to bring back their original versions in similar fashions and for the same reasons.   
---
Yes, their histories and the intricacies of their development and the content they provide are carbon copies of eachother.  
---
I totally see it now. They're basically identical.
---
Does this work for both factions? Can I note someone that ganked me so I can do it to them when I'm big and strong?

From the PVP Bluepost:"The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12." In 1.12 you were only able to purchase the updated versions so thats what it will be.
---
Because BG's weren't in vanilla when it was originally released and the community said they wanted "no changes". I really wish they would reconsider and put BG's in at the same time as the honor system so that being out in the world doesnt become such a shit show on pvp servers...
---
Whats stopping you playing the content? Already at full raid bis with 10k gold?
---
Coincidentally, I work with Rails where throwing a bigger server at it is usually good enough 🙃
---
All jokes aside, I do get what you’re trying to say. Classic is how classic was back then, and back then it was still a problem.
---
If you say so. I had no trouble with yellow quests or blowing my long cds for a few group ones. Only thing I bought was a 1g blue wep in my 20s then a 2g one in my 30s never had any trouble
---
The fact that you think buying it off the AH is more exciting is weird...
---
Its blwomg my mind why do you even play wow ?
---
Wows not the kind of game where you  farm gold and buy the best raid gear you actually need to raid.
---
I think you might need a game like Black desert online . You can earn gold and buy the best gear in the game just from the AH without doing raids.
---
WoW is more about dropping your gear in raids not buying it m
---
 Check through the BiS lists for DPS warriors and you’ll see a fair bit of leather and mail. Truestrike Shoulders, Edgemaster’s Handguards, etc. Many of those pieces give AP instead of Str/Agi, and in a lot of cases, it’s the crit chance or hit chance that DPS warriors want.

Check the combat logs.

IMHO the difference been tiers of groups is generally based on the following:
---
How many players X/5 or X/10 etc don't know the basic buttons to make thier character function? If this is more than zero you will only be strong if the other players are top tier/geared enough to carry.
---
How many players in the group are not proficient at the utility portion of thier class. Sheep, trap, innervate, bres, seduce, blind, sap, etc? If more than zero you will struggle with any accidental ads, tougher bosses, tougher than usual trash packs etc. This can also be made up by carrying and is easier to do since at least the "carry" can fulfill thier basic role.

Is your group comp reasonable? Bringing a shaman tank, healer that is dps specced and three moonkins to any difficult dungeon is going to end poorly. Bring at least one relevant cc. Don't bring offspec players unless you know you can carry etc. (This applies at higher levels such as ~40+, bring 5 moonkins to rfc if you want) This also means bringing level appropriate  players, especially  tank/heals. 
---
How well can your communicate and work as a team? This is the only thing I think you can't carry. A player that either can't or won't behave reasonably is going to cause wipes and frustration  because thier bad behavior tends to scale with how much of thier bullshit it seems you can handle. I am speaking mainly of players that do things like chain pull as a non tank, don't dismiss pets, dont care about threat, pull random extra trash in the middle of fights because they wanted to make sure they get a node or quest item first etc.
---
The last thing I will mention is gear. I think this is the least important factor unless you are on the extreme high or low end. Obviously  bringing even a couple max geared players into BRD you can get away with a lot more shenanigans and things will go smoothly.
---
All in all the separation between great groups and ok groups generally is that great groups have all the players that can do the things listed above sans gear.  
---
Ok groups are missing a small amount of coordination, have a player or two that aren't very good at utility, etc
---
Rough groups have noticable flaws in coordination, might be under level or severely under geared, players are unfamiliar with the dungeon or even basic dungeon protocols, very low utility proficiency etc.
---
Hell groups are ones with a toxic, arrogant, or just absolutely awful player in them that is actively causing the frustration.
---
What you got against dad gamers child?
---
well, obviously 0+0 is 0, but Ive seen servers in dramatic reduction that could have easily been saved had 2-4 low pop servers been merged into a medium+
---
Are you upset? No one said it’s identical?
---
This is the officer shit that makes me stay cleaning the mopo till 1900?
---
So the rogue who farmed the hell out to buy that BiS dagger cant roll on it but some lazy rogue just gets it as the only one rolling need? 
---
Also you understand that this can be easily abused and someone with that BiS dagger just switch to smthing worse before joining dungeon so he can get that dagger again for gold! Or even change all his gear to make EVERYTHING an upgrade!
---
Thats why "Need All Boe" should and will become default rules its just a matter of time when everyone will realise it! But people like you will just continue to get robbed by ninjas or "worse gear abuse" trick.
---
I’m 100% sure there isn’t I see my target cast my heal my mana is used up but no health is restored! 
---
The heals missing the is more of a title than anything. I’ve asked people and it’s not just me having this happen too
---
Any faction exclusive pets, they sell very well and most people are more than happy to pay a little extra for the service.
---
Only problem is that the pet market isn't exactly hot right now because people are prioritizing BiS items over cosmetics.
---
It doesn't really matter what you want, the community wants to play classic wow, as it was, not your preferred version of it. The world doesn't revolve around you.
---
Yeah I figured you for a PvPer lol. Why would you even rush to 60 when you know theres months before any significant pvp action?
---
Does she have a sister?
---
Are you near a mob that can bash, do you have heal macros that stop casting?
---
Heals don't misfire.
---
Classic did not have bgs? Wow til
---
Nice slippery slope
---
Sure is lol. Tauren warrior
---
Arise my champion
---
You mean “winning the loottery”.
---
And what's the screenshot of your combat log say? Did it say that you healed for 0? Did it say you healed for 300 and they got hit for 300? 
---
The answer is in the combat log.
---
I'm looking for a new MMO to play, and surprisingly I've never played WoW. Naturally I have a few questions;
---
1) Is Classic just a fad? I love the idea of playing classic rather then retail, but will it last? have they got plans to expand it over a few years or is it a once off experience?
---
2) If by chance it doesn't, have I missed the boat with retail wow? (I know this question isn't related to classic wow, sorry...)
---
3) are their dedicated Aussie servers?
---
Thanks guys!
---
Run brd for mc attune  
---
Do your Onyxia quest chain  
---
Avoid professions now more than ever (they will take your gold imo)  
---
When you group up with level 60’s, at the end of the dungeon (if you performed average or better) ask them if their guild raids mc currently and if they’re recruiting.  
---
Head to Azshara to start on the Hydraxian waterlords quests (mc rep quests)
---
No. Warlocks get a quest to get their epic mount that requires mats
---
60s lose honor for killing anyone below level 50. Theres also a limit on how many times you can kill a player and still get honor.
---
Nope. I’m in the back in ZF most the time. My heals cast time is complete. Mana used
---
I always thought it was to inform everything the driver might sometimes get distracted with a child on board.
---
Oh my goodness, is perception on use? I'm an idiot.
---
Find a warrior and be poor together.
---
My best guess is the fishing trinket. Which is dope. Also, happy cake day.
---
Me:
---
&gt;If you are playing BM and are dropping 4/5 frenzy with a 2.0 pet you are doing something deeply, horribly wrong.
---
You:
---
&gt;Why is 4/5 frenzy with a 2.0 pet deeply, horribly wrong?
---
That's the basis of my accusation.  Again it's not the spec that wrong.  It's actually the best possible BM spec, but what I'm saying this that broken tooth is unnecessary in a PvE context for the maintenance of the frenzy buff.
---
If you genuinely want to do damage as a fresh 60, the 2/31/18 is preferable.  If you have enough hit gear you can go 17/31/3 or 20/31/0.  It's possible that BM does more damage in an absolute sense if your gear is bad enough but if your damage and gear is that bad no one cares what your spec is.  Once you get even a handful of drops from BRD/LBRS you'll be better off in a non-BM spec.
---
Whatever you do, don't follow the icy-veins or wowhead guides.  Those trees are objectively shit.
---
DEATH TO THE STORMCLOAKS!
---
Roleplaying shit aside, Blizzard didn't change the loot system aside because a few people couldn't learn to play nice, it's that people on reddit complained and whined incessantly that they got ninja'd when a perfectly fine solution already exists they just simply couldn't understnd it.
---
He was hit for roughly the same amount of healing he received. It happens a lot. It's also why you can NS heal someone who then dies anyway. They're simulating the "server ticks" instead of running the game with a kind of refresh rate that makes the classic/bfa comparison **feel** like how 15 fps vs 60 fps **looks**.  
---
Heals don't miss or just disappear or w/e.
---
I love them.
---
They hold aggro better, do more dps, and I don't have to dps while healing to stay awake during the run.
---
Wow that’s lame imo I’d rather be in a social guild that uses guild chat to chat with each other as intended who wants to tab out of game to chat
---
1 month = rushing, and im not a pvper, I do both, it's just pve is not fun when you clear the raid the first raid
---
Trying to get attention by riding on a successful person's coattails
---
I can respect it
---
I bought a fiery wax axe on my warrior alt for 40g. Now I'm realizing that its not that amazing for warriors so should I try to resell? Or just use it because I have it now?
---
Which makes sense!! I did have a priest complain about it today though. I think I need to dig into this more
---
And here I thought someone was going to apologise to me for corpse camping my warlock outside SM whilst he was trying to summon our healer until he gave up and logged out, ruining our run completely.
---
Although tbf that warlock was quite a special guy
---
Because of the existence of the auction house, I can easily sell a freezing band and buy a warden staff (bis for me) with that money. So a freezing band dropping is functionally the same thing as a warden staff dropping. Why would I roll greed on something that is essentially my bis in a different form?
---
ELI5?

And we're walking to mordor!

Anytime I see blacklist talk I assume it’s Faerlina.

I honestly can't get this macro to work. I can't make the x5 work.
---
This is footage from the same guild on the same server, within the same hour. Only difference is there's about 100 fewer players participating.
---
Assuming you are going affliction (using dots and avoiding shadow bolts).  
---
Send in vw, cast siphon life (if you have), agony, corruption, and then either immolate or wand the mob to death.  
---
Generally you will pull aggro when the mob is getting close to dying.
---
Also when you fear mobs and they start getting close to other mobs
---
Use curse of recklessness
---
If he starts getting close to you, fear could still be on him and when you put curse of agony he will then flee in fear, again.
---
You’re stupid
---
Quite possibly, what are your professions though?
---
Let it all out.
---
you can try asking for a senior gm?
---
I love the dude's expression
---
We're &lt;Zug Zug&gt;.

Omg this is what i have been looking for!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ty

He has to be memeing right? There’s no way his voice is that over the top.
---
You have enter it 5 times. The macro would be:
---
/roll 13
---
Sorry for the confusion.
---
I haven't seen anyone sniping, since they're regularly going for 30-40g at this point, but yeah when I farmed one it was definitely not to sell. I used it the second I got it.
---
If you’ve fully quested both plaguelands, there should be 4-8 quests for strat (not sure how many)
---
So, what you're saying is, I'm a dumbass. Lol
---
Gold is gold, mate. I NEED gold, so everyone should be needing everything. Greed was put in by Blizzard for no reason!
---
What if you wake up at 4, game til 5, then pretend to be asleep til she leaves for jogging?
---
On my shaman, I've found the 3.0 ish range on weapons to be nice.  Wind fury is 20% chance on hit,  not procs per minute,  so faster swings mean more procs. They don't hit has hard, but they hit more frequently. A slow 1h and a shield can be better than a slow 2h. Marginal difference in overall damage,  and much more mitigation
---
I am not subscribing for  that long without bgs
---
maybe he likes ending up on ignore lists? :l
---
Na i was just being lazy lol
---
Priests casting Fort while you were healing them, Warlock using Life Tap?  Casting down ranked spells and not healing as much?
---
I’d have to see the logs, something logical and explainable is going on.
---
Love the music selection
---
Almost all of my runs have been without a “real” tank. It’s usually just a warrior that can two hand aggro and my pet that tanks casters
---
This crashed my browser. Well done!!
---
Work as a unit and don’t run in to danger by yourself ?
---
Maybe you just started the heal just before you target switched?
---
Worth so much? He just said it’s 25s
---
Got a self cast button pushed? I think the default is alt key
---
Confusing wording. 3 mins apart 2 days later.

Rammstein works too
---
Is there an add-on that gives notice/ warning when you’ve found an item that will likely sell for lots on the ah?  
---
Eh some boe blue drops and you aren’t sure about selling for 20g or 200g it would help out.
---
Please tell me what it's like in scarlet monastery for alliance players in your server.
---
Beautiful
---
ive been camping for a few days, but no such luck.
---
Saw her twice, the first time I gave her to a dwarf hunter because he was there longer than I was, and i helped guard him while he tamed her. The second time there was another dwarf who was a higher level than me, and as I tamed it he killed me then killed BT ;\_;
---
all the freaking out about layering for nothing
---
Actually 3 times check again.
---
You dont need much. I would stack as much intellect and spirit as possible. Go BM spec and have your pet max out nature resist. Pet tank princess, you only use your mana on serpent sting and mend pet. Weave mend pet in between your auto shots. Beware of the rock throw spell she does because it locks your mend pet if it hits you while you cast it. It takes a long as time, so the more agility you can stack as well will make it go faster, but you will run out of mend pet mana quickly if you arent careful. Your normal dungeon blues with as much pre bis as possible, with some high int replacements in a few slots should be fine.
---
I agree with the other guys. Nice job.
---
That's true at 60, but in leveling dungeons (which is what this thread is about), dps warriors really can only top dps charts if they're higher level than everyone else.
---
There's another one at the thousand needles border!  
---
Major oof.
---
&gt;Thankfully it seems like more people are joining classic instead

This is not correct at all. The only way you lose honor is by getting dishonorable kills, which comes from killing NPC’s marked as ‘civilians’. Stop spreading misinformation

You know, there’s a way to play the sound files in game? I used to have a rogue macro with garrote that would play this sound, and a PoM pyro macro for my mage that played Rag’s “BY FIRE BE PURGED!”

Boohoo, I leveled warrior 1-60 it’s not that hard to hold your pride and slap on sword and board. Sucks they said LF DPS, but crying about it on reddit is hilarious! Hahaha
---
I'm in a similar boat, but looking to settle down  - At least before p2 hits.   
---
I've got numerous 10-25, but nothing higher. I figure the first step is settle on server. Then settle on class.  
---
Then enjoy.
---
Best combo for leveling imo. Troll potions, extra stats, and healing make it a good choice. It's also very easy to level.
---
Hmm theres orc further down, I couldnt find any ledges tho. I tried all edges of the mountains

I like this schedule.  I don’t want the phases rushed too quickly.  Im in the high 50s now and I’m still looking forward to end game dungeons, MC/Ony, BIS phase 1 items, epic mount, swapping professions, and finishing some reps.  Might dabble with an alt.
---
My sympathies to the PVP crowd though, who will be very antsy for BGs by New Years Eve.
---
I love when that happens had one guy gank ne while questing in un’goro in vanilla and he didnt know i had my main which was a 60 rogue so switched and noticed he was doing the escort quest and let him get almost done before killing him from stealth. He had a second account with an horde character and went crazy messaging me told him its payback. best time i ever had. His messages made my day!
---
very eu comment
---
Pretty sure this is on Benediction. I got the exact same message from Tupac today.
---
No rush loving the grind

“I had the right guy selected, bugged game must have switched it!”

on zandalar tribe eu I bought mine from someone for 150g and I've seen it in the AH for 250

Fun to watch, but the voice was off. I also always wonder if all of this Asmon stuff is all semi-staged.

Nah. Crz is disabled on rp realms (except the small realms who are linked) except for the latest content and the main cities. The rp scene is thriving in Wyrmrest and Moonguard NA and Argent Dawn EU. But the Crz always seems to break every patch on Tuesday until blizz reverts it :p

Tank Druids are best used as off-tanks and have plenty of time to Innervate, Rebirth, and decurse.

If you really think someone rolling need on BoEs and selling them will get them blacklisted on a server, you are delusional. I've never been in a party where that wasn't the method of handling BoEs.
---
and others think it is asocial jerks like you... see this system lets us add each other to our blacklists and works out after all.
---
One has BoPs that you can always use, whilst the other has BoEs/1-time use items that you always need to craft.
---
'some/most' people choose the bop/permanent item path first, then drop, re-level and keep the other path. You do get to keep and use everything from the other path though.
---
Phase 2 I thought, but I don't think it's worth waiting, unless you just don't have the time or motivation to grind the 900g before the phase hits
---
Usually it is whoever starts spinning.
---
Because its gonna cost them more from the vendor. You are in control.
---
Sure you can just give everyone free everything but the endless pms in cities just get annoying with time and you cant be arsed to make more drinks if theres nothing in it for you
---
Looks like the Path of Glory was brought to Azeroth
---
They were looking for DPS... when people /w me saying they can DPS I invite them for DPS
---
That's a bandaid solution to something that needs stitches
---
And asmon said he could kill this guy??
---
But that doesn't apply, since they invited him to DPS. If it was a problem, they could have gotten a non-warrior.
---
How sad do you have to be to add someone on bnet just to talk shit
---
Complaining about complaining...
---
Also, if you have enchanting (i think) there's some rep items that are must-have.
---
So, instead of turning in your feathers or necklaces, hold onto them as mobs stop giving rep at...honored and then it's only turn-ins
---
I mean, if you want to post a screen shot form a month ago, sure.
---
Are Rogues fun while leveling? I like the class fantasy of a female night elf rogue and dual wielding, but if their rotation is the same exact thing throughout all of leveling then that might not be as entertaining.
---
Broken macro for your heal?
---
Sure you can, it's your life, you can do whatever you want. I'm a DPS warrior and I get groups all the time without any problems. People like the fact that my DPS is better than most classes and I don't die easily.
---
Good news, there’s a version of WoW that allows you to turn off PvP!
---
haHAA
---
Leave the gear at the bank. 
---
There's no point wearing cloth int gear when you could be wearing str plate.
---
It always has been I think. Or maybe they're just way more likely to talk about it.
---
15 year old's brain cells.
---
Druid. PvP is so much fun as a druid. People will take you in dungeons in any role, if you have the gear, which is easy to find. Soloing is super easy too.
---
I can easily defend them, BFA is a much more fleshed out and well designed game, and it's not even close. The amount of times people have had to defend some of the shit design in Classic with "OH BUT THAT'S JUST CLASSIC HEHE" or "they hadn't thought of it yet" is astounding. And they're not wrong, but that's the way it is.
---
But the real answer is that you should let people enjoy what they like without having to call the other one shit 24/7, they both exist side by side and are on the same sub for a reason...
---
Edit: I want to add, I say this while tabbed out on break after tanking and killing bosses in MC, having a ton of fun with Classic, but yeah.
---
Brady Games originally sold this back in the day. It has since been lost to time. Some other redditors uploaded some high-res scans about a month back. I've linked their posts above. I took those scans and played around in photoshop to highlight areas, add level zones and add the missing flight paths.
---
I'm a warrior who tanks. People like you need to learn that classes are not roles. If someone wants to stick to a role (e.g. DPS and not tanking), then they have every right to.

I sold a my [almost] BIS T6 druid in TBC when I realised my addiction was too much, I didn't want a job because all I wanted to do was play. I got £700 for my account which settled my debts at the time but 2 weeks later I reclaimed the account. Felt horrible and expected a PayPal dispute which never came, so I was £700 up and got to continue my addiction.
---
Why the screaming tho. Bleh

 That's what the servers actually look like right now surprisingly.
---
The caps might have changed.

Yeah, when I run by someone, the last thing I’m gonna do is stop and consult/review a list of names. Dumb kids.

...is complaining.
---
My brother and I are warrior priest combo and it’s been an absolute blast.
---
I completely agree. But sadly no, not to my knowledge.
---
Facts, can't deny.
---
My ears already hurt thinking about how discord (or whatever voip you use) must have sounded.
---
Yeah, you'll have to have it on in big picture mode.
---
I know. i wish it were so. I have learned to embrace it.
---
No citation needed, only feelings! 
---
If you feel a certain way it MUST be true.
---
As per your request, I have downvoted a post that is doing nothing but complaining. Yours.
---
The value of an epic mount is 800 gold. The value of a skeleton mount in Classic as alliance is many many many many many many times more gold
---
You’re a complete idiot or a troll
---
I dunno man they get frosted pretty well
---
1 is true, 2 isn't true for classic because they rely on the desktop companion app which doesn't work with classic, 3 is opinion.
---
They can, but many people can't say no to that intellect boost that comes with being a gnome. Personally, even with such a juicy racial, I will never roll a gnome.
---
Yeah he kind of sounds like a douchebag.
---
I love how the argent rep is just tossed in the middle of that. As if they witnessed you entertaining this idea and went “well that’s a swell fella for listening.”
---
Both of you don't seem very bright
---
420
---
If there were items you could vendor for 200 gold you bet your ass that's exactly what would happen. 
---
My logic is that if the item is worth more in gold than it is as an upgrade then it doesn't make sense for people to pass on their chance for the best use of the item (to sell it) just because someone else wants to waste that extra value by equipping the item. 
---
So if you think the vendor price for BoPs is worth more than equipping it then yes, you should advocate for everyone needing on them. 
---
But I don't. So I won't.

Pws is bad for rage producing classes. They make rage from attacking g And being attacked. When shielded they gain 50% the rage they normally would. A rage staved warrior cant grab and hold aggro

I know hunter pets have a pet bar and if you right click the attack feature it gets a boarder meaning it auto attacks when you join combat? Maybe locks are same

I’m confused. Are you speaking to the opposing faction?
---
Beat it tonight! Didn’t have a taunt, but me and another paladin swapped aggro and pre bubbled the sleeps. We had a hunter that could feign death, and we bop’d the other two teammates. It was such a challenge, but felt great to beat Eranikus
---
Explain to me how it’s terrible to want your character to look good? It seems like you people just blindly hate anything retail has.
---
 Another tip is to learn about using lower rank spells. With +spell power a rank 2 flash heal might norm heal as a rank 4 flash heal and crit even higher but cost a lot less mana. Good for long haul fights
---
It feels all to late unfortunately. I personally know people who made a five digit amount of gold from layer abuse. We were promised layers were only for the starting zone and were let down tremendously. Changing it now almost doesn't make a difference now. Everyone who abused this is now rich to the point where they never have to worry about gold again for the rest of Classic.

good way to kill classic lol

Rogues get a decent kit and unique gameplay options with stealing, stealth and lockpicking.

How do you do this , send bnet friend request.  I always just add people as their character name, and somehow I often get requests as a bnet friend thought I would prefer to convert it somehow to a character one.

In any case once I was asked to add as a bnet , and I have no idea how you can do that with just the character name.

Gratz!

There is no picture of me on reddit, so I can’t look like anything. You seem to be lashing out at pretty much anyone who responds, so I won’t mince words this time. No one is going to type out a huge guide when you can literally look up dozens of videos or use detailed resources like classic wowhead and classic icey veins. Maybe if you helped yourself every once ina while and stopped acting like you’re 12, people would troll you less.

As a feral druid leveling I've died exactly two times in pvp. One was a similarly leveled warlock that killed me as I was doing an escort quest and had 2 mobs on me. I eventually camped his body till he seemingly logged off, leaving his corpse there while I redid my quest. 
---
The second time was a 8 levels higher warrior that killed me as I was fighting a raptor in stv. 
---
Every other pvp scenario I either won or had the ability to escape with my life. I'm Alliance, if you think Horde players are any better you're delusional.
---
Ecksdee.

How did it ruin a major part of wow? It’s literally just appearance.

Actually bad but only for PVE. And I wouldn't consider it a min max thing. The spell power differences are huge:
---
Felheart Slippers have 18 spell power. Maleki's Footwraps (blue from Strath) have 27 shadow power.
---
Felheart Horns have 20 spell power. Green Lens of Shadow Wrath has 34-36 shadow power.
---
Felheart Shoulderpads have 9 spell power. Green "of Shadow Wrath" shoulders have 29-30 shadow power.
---
The Felheart set makes up for its lack of damage in huge stam, so warlock T1 is great... but only for PVP.
---
That’s just complete bullshit. Prices are just fine
---
As a hunter i generally help people kill things if they look overwhelmed, no grouping needed
---
Demon skin
---
Wait really?! I'm horde and I feel stalked and hunted there. If I step outside of tarren mill I'm fucked. I had no idea that it is generally worse for Alliance.
---
Macro bug? I farsighted from orgrimmar to taurajo no issue
---
This guy got the reference.
---
No its like the real world. 3.99
---
Personally I think the 25% stun resist is much more valuable plus the burst racial but both have their benefits
---
&gt;So I respawn a bit further away and run away. Nope, this guy follows me in travel form. Like, you go out of your way to kill a player who's running away and rewards you nothing, when you could be killing mobs and levelling. Just...why?
---
To be honest, this is my FAVORITE thing about pvp right now. There is no honor, no pvp gear, no single reason to kill you. I killed you just because I can, because I wanted to, and because you are horde. Let the faction hate reign supreme!
---
As a side-note, I'm also leveling a priest and whoever decided to INITIATE the attack on you are idiots. Spriests are THE best class/spec for 1 v 1 and sometimes 2 v 1. I regularly kill horde up to six levels higher than me 1 v 1 and regularly beat people my own level 2 v 1.
---
That sounds like fun, I'll have to try this out!
---
Went through every back door like coward Alliance, too.
---
You respec to shadow and then respec back when you want to do healer things. That is how.
---
Makes me wonder what they had planned for cat form, or travel form even. That would be interesting. Running around the world so you can run around the world.. faster
---
Sure, if you scroll passed the 15 high/medium population servers.
---
Stop trying to manipulate data to prove a point that doesn't exist.
---
It's very strong early levels and high levels with good great. I cant imagine it less than 20-25 mins maybe with talents or something.
---
Right, but bans went out for people abusing layering. 
---
I can't see how that's possible if there were only two layers.
---
Very true. Enchanting is useful once per item, alchemy is useful once per raid (flask / elixir) and like once per fight (MP potions)
---
Where’s the apology? Sure wasn’t in the image or in the body of the post. 
---
And not “for being mad” but for lashing out at a complete stranger telling them to kill themselves over a minor setback in a video game. 
---
You think that such emotions are what “makes the game great” but I think throwing a tantrum and telling other people to die is what makes a community toxic.
---
I love you.
---
Yeah. But then you're limiting yourself to zero communication in a heavily team based game. It's unfortunate it worked out this way; just not worth the grievance for me to try it again.
---
Spirit is your best leveling stat buddy.
---
unless you force him to play as OT, there are only 3 fights that a druid cannot MT. Additionally, when first getting to MC they have by far the highest threat generation of ANY tank and allow your dps a lot of freedom in dps.
---
Does anyone know why technically this happens? Player position being checked server side more often? It would be really cool if they would do a tech write-up on the differences, but I know they won't.
---
#PREPARE FOR RAMMING SPEED!
---
Right, but bans went out for people abusing layering, no?
---
There is a lot of unused content or ideas that were only played with. I'm thinking mostly of zones such as Azshara and areas in the game files such as the Emerald Dream and Old Outland.
---
You can reset after 5 seconds:
---
Priest psychic scream 8 seconds
---
Warlock fear 10 seconds
---
Hunter freezing trap 10 seconds scatter shot 4 seconds
---
Warrior intimidating shout 10 seconds
---
Mage poly 30 seconds
---
Rogue gouge 5.5 seconds if specced else vanish 5 min cd
---
CD on trinket swap 30 seconds. Only warrior cc cd longer.
---
So in conclusion 5 classes can reset as much as they want.   Keep drinking that Kool-aid
---
What you're supposed to do depends on whether you play Alliance.
---
Hit is huge, but Warlocks need to shake the idea that it's the end all.
---
Hit is worth 16-18 spell power so you're still going to replace Ban'thok sash with Sash of Whispered Secrets given the opportunity.
---
Thought this might be about Chestnutz.
---
&gt; At 60 or with a single target shatter build it's roughly 8 int to 1 +spell damage
---
What does that mean exactly?
---
I find it hard to believe that if you could choose to get a bracers enchant with 80 int or 10 spell dmg, you'd pick the spell dmg.
---
This is true, espeically with layering. But once layering is gone and a person makes enough of a reputation for themselves, KoS does actually start to mean something.
---
Back in the day there was a hunter on my server that was infamous. People were spamming in trade with bounties to kill the bastard.
---
Alliance isn't sending its best
---
Ha! Is that all!?
---
because they literally just announced it, all are down to at most two, about a dozen are all the way down to one.
---
The worst is when they spam “LF1M DPS” and the. They say, sorry not looking for warrior.
---
Im wondering if they just never release phase 2 until the population thins on the big servers?  Which would be really bad for the low pop servers
---
I haven't seen scorpids mentioned, but they are OP in pvp when combined with viper sting. Scorpids apply a 5x stacking poison, which makes viper sting really hard to dispell. Expect to see more of them in P2.
---
wtf my guild has been doing that too for a while now lol
---
It's nice for leveling so you don't have to go to a major city to visit AH. I'm currently only in barrens and after I log I just mail all my crap to my alt and she puts it on the AH. Saves a lot of time for me
---
Was the person an orc?
---
Orcs have a racial the can drastically reduce healing, to the point you might not see it if they're also taking damage.
---
&gt; 60s lose honor for killing anyone below level 50. 
---
This is not correct.  You don't ever lose honor for killing other players. Just NPCs that are labeled "Civilian".
---
They literally said 2 at most for even the big ones. [https://warcraft.news/2019/10/03/layering-and-phase-2](https://warcraft.news/2019/10/03/layering-and-phase-2)
---
I use to do that a lot with my Priest. When I see someone with half life, I use MC on them and then Renew or Fortitude
---
It is really funny because their first reaction is to run away xD
---
Literally the reason I went nelf over dwarf or hunter.. radials were way more juicy but I knew I’d regret it in the long run
---
Nooooooooooononono there is not hahahahha. There is 2 pieces of loot per boss for 40 people. There is not. Lol.
---
Its a weapon for 40-49 twink bracket, how long it will take for the bracket to develop is hard to say.
---
Leave and find a new guild
---
I play Ally, but I was Horde the first time around.
---
How does lazy stereotyping about the "type" of person who plays a given faction account for those of us who rerolled this time around to see how the other side has it?
---
No ones gunna say anything about the 420 69?
---
&gt;S3 now
---
F
---
But ... the list ...
---
I agree that we're not on the same page lol, I'm trying to follow your argument to its logical conclusion but one of the assumptions is not making sense
---
I've started to refuse using the word or concept of "Bis". I just call it my preraid gear on my gearing list, and there are several sanity downgrades from true "bis".
---
It's petty, but god that mentality/term has gotten annoying.
---
I still try and kill players when I get notified they are on my kill on sight list. I may not remember what they did, but if they are on my kos list, they did something dirty and I need to charge them
---
And if you can’t grasp how that isn’t a major part of the game, you better be prepared to get a lot of negative comments on this sub....  appearance is one of the staples and should be one of the staples that make an mmo great.
---
You wear what you wear.  If you’re a pvper you should look like a pvper.  If you’re a top tier raider you should look like a top tier raider.  If you’re a trash can you should look like a trash can.  It’s part of what makes your character show its progress.
---
When you have transmog you have top tier raiders that look like they are level 2 and people in quest greens decked out in low level matching gear like Defias or Scarlett gear sets. 
---
When I go to attack you in vanilla, I don’t know your health, I don’t know your mana, I don’t know what spec you are.  But if I clearly see you’re holding a rank 14 weapon or tier 3, I’m fucking right off.  But if you’re level 60 and I see you are still rockin the clown suit with a mask from ZF, I know you’re a free hk.
---
Find a new guild and cry myself to sleep hoping that the merge causes dramas and the whole guild falling 2 shit
---
Look at my other comments it’s more of a title I’m 100% right there is something going on.
---
Well, this wins. Definitely they stupidest. I would’ve left this guild tbh but you do you!
---
Yes. Death coil will 75% chance he will pop WotF. If not, he will pop it when you fear right after. Cor, CoA, SL if you have it, immo. By now felhunter would have eaten the priest's shield. WotF immunity is now over so you can HowloTerror, shadowbolt, fear. Renew corruption and drain life. Should be close to dead by now and he hasn't got so much as a Pain on you *and perhaps a mind blast, if felhunter didn't counterspell him.
---
I have had this on my priest a few times. For me it happens when just switch to a target. I had a few people die before I noticed the log stated that I didn’t heal my target but instead healed myself (usually 0 healer xxx over healed).
---
Name collisions are a much better alternative to dead realms or cross realm zones though.
---
Upper end chests were nerfed at some point to make farming the chests not super profitable. Saw someone mention this in another post and it sounds familiar to me from Vanilla
---
That's Thalanaar
---
The .1% of cases is a pretty fucking huge deal.
---
This
---
that really never happens tho, outside of low level noob hunters
---
Play at your own pace. Don’t play a class you don’t really like because you’re afraid of falling behind. It will just ruin your experience when your at 60.
---
The Namielle alpha set on a male is pretty much the coolest armor set I’ve ever seen. I’m putting together a hidden elemental damage build just because the set looks so sweet.

Wtf... so it’s a bug then? That has to be

My girlfriend and I returned to WoW for classic, and she plays on an HP from Walmart near that price range. WoW Classic would run off a toaster imo. You should be fine with whatever you can pull off.
---
What is this “realm layering update”?
---
Even good gear looks bad in classic LOL look at any classes pre raid bis or post raid bis and you look like a clown.
---
As a warrior I will jump in and taunt if someone is about to die.
---
One time though... I taunted a level 35 turtle off an orc hunter when I was just level 30. The hunter just bailed and left me to die. I WILL NEVER FORGIVEEEE
---
That addon only showed characters on your faction.  Were you seeing 6000 or 3000 and doubling it?
---
you'd think "don't be an idiot" and "listen to advice/peer consensus before making unilateral decisions" could be taken as read, but it's military pme. you assume everyone knows literally nothing, and then teach them what they need to know
---
not exaggerating. there was a guy in my row in basic who couldn't figure out how to properly swing his arms while marching. in the air force, where our concept of "marching" basically just means "all casually walking the same way and at the same time." his arms worked perfectly fine while walking outside of a formation, but put him in a formation and tell him "you're marching now," and his arms just go fucking haywire
---
i've had to counsel someone and find them a barracks buddy to remind them to eat food daily.
---
you assume everyone knows nothing, because any piece of information you assume is common sense, someone will show up not knowing it and find a way to hurt themselves because of it
---
There’s nothing going on. Heals don’t miss. You’re just wrong. That’s all there is to it. If you want to tell someone who mains healers that heals can be dodged, more power to you. But that doesn’t change the fact that they can’t miss.
---
Over one kill, not even camping or griefing or letting me die to mobs to take durability? Nah that’s sad
---
Arathi honestly has some great world PvP.  As a 36 Enh, a 41 Mage tried to 1v1 me.  He opened up with sheep and fireball...Boy did he ever start running with his tail tucked after I threw down grounding totem and spammed Frost Shock/Earth shock.  He had a bad day.  My heart rate tho...over 9000.  He didn't mess with me after that.
---
A better question is how does someone who says they literally re-prioritised and restructured their life for the 60 grind, including minimal sleep, say with a straight face that they didn't rush to 60?
---
53 agi is 1% crit at 60. At 49 it' takes less ago for crit.
---
Depends, how bad graphics are you willing to tolerate?
---
Vilod: JUSTICE!
---
Sounds like operator error.
---
No I’m not. Lol LOOK at the other fucking comments people are agreeing I have guildies agreeing fandoms agreeing. SORRY
---
One thing I loved about GW2 was the WPVP maps. Those were truly epic and the zones to conquer and hold was so much fun. Especially in the early days of GW2 playing a Mesmer hiding within a building and then creating a portal was the best since it had no limit on how many people it can take before it runs out of time
---
Sphh, I invite any shaman to my ubrs groups. The totems alone makes it worth really.

Nobody forced you to race to 60 lol

holy I love this

I’ve played on a laptop that I bought back in 2016 for $200ish. I’m pretty sure you can get a decent HP laptop with an i5 for $500. Should be more than enough.
---
It’s not laughable it’s a piece of the puzzle that ruined wow for sure.  I just explained it to you how it does, accept it.   If you wanna look cool and awesome, then have cool and awesome gear, not quest greens.
---
And most people who wanted classic DO care, which is why this is a dumb opinion.
---
Makes you mad
---
Shaman DPS has terrible mana efficiency, but totems are godlike
---
Hunter t3 is so ugly.
---
The only problem I have with warlocks is those who doesn’t drink or eat in between pulls with their healer. Like if the rest of the group is waiting for the healer to drink you might as well spend that time drinking/eating. The last thing I wanna do after drinking is spending ~30% of my mana on a warlock that’s been staring at me for half a minute. Because as a healer I’d like to be close to full mana for the next pull just in case of an emergency.
---
Oh yes they are
---
And I stated now 5 times. The miss was like a title. Read the thread understand it see the comments I’m not the only one...

I hate that damn place. No noticeable rewards and zero quest objects!

Mace is technically better for the one weight stone you can put on it.

It says it there. The realms has been reduced to either 1 layer or 2 layers. This is in preparation of moving every realm to 1 layer by phase 2.
---
Why is it hard to get there? There's literally two alliance flight paths in Feralas.
---
I dont know why it's becoming a trend to post pictures of basic chat logs and put some edgy title on it.
---
You never greed on a boe epic. If you wanna be fair, everyone should “need” it. The second someone says “everyone greed” without rolling first, you should be careful. There is no reason for everyone to greed, the outcome is the same when everyone needs. 
---
It’s best to discuss it before the dungeon though. The game should never guard players vs ninjas, that’s literally going back to retail. Players should be the one to dispute these kinds of interactions.
---
Ahhh, now I get it. Thanks!
---
You mean the 3 other people, one of which didn’t experience it himself?  Compared to everyone else who says you’re wrong?  
---
Heals don’t miss. That’s all there is to it.
---
Lol your so ignorant
---
Use Divine Intervention on the mages to help them AOE the IED's
---
It just makes you look like a selfish weirdo.
---
Wearing threat gear with a healer you don't know is probably a bad idea this early. But decent healers can keep you up, especially if you know them well and they know what they're going in to. And they will only have to worry about healing you considering the amount of threat and rage you gain as compared to having full mitigation gear. A lot of good players tank as fury DW at the moment and just switch to a shield whenever they're tanking heavy damage. Later on it's entirely possible to tank with 2H as well (dungeons that is), a lot of the high end tanks are actually going fury/prot with threat gear late into the game because threat is much more important even in Naxx. Optimally of course you wouldn't want leather but plate with high agility. You probably also need mitigation gear on trash but it depends entirely on the pulls and mobs.
---
Play whatever class you like the most. If you choose the druid you'll catch up in no time now that you know what you're doing and don't think of the time spent as wasted if you had a good time. The game is not a race and there really isn't much content at max level yet so you can take your time if you like.
---
I would spend that $500 on a desktop, especially if you have long gaming sessions. Laptops get really hot when gaming and won't last nearly as long as a desktop. You also get less bang for your buck and less upgradability down the road.
---
My phone freezes up when I try to open the 400mb file.  Poop.
---
Is there a separate feral set?
---
I know nothing about computer specs bul im playing on a shitty 200 dollar laptop i bought from Walmart like 3 years ago .
---
KOS works for 20 minutes max.
---
Did you add the add on correctly?
---
Did you put the correct folder in the add on folder?
---
Did you put the add on in the classic add on folder?
---
Basically to handle the huge amount of people in the start every server had many layers to ease the crowding. So instead of having 5 servers u can have 1 server with 5 layers that would have the same effect to spread out players.
---
Now that people are more spread out in the world they have started remove layers to ultimately bring it down to 1.
---
and as a healer it's very frustrating when the tank uses blood rage
---
Yep, failing the jump at caverns of time would get you in that scenario. I think sometimes you eventually died, not sure. You could also start drifting across the entire map. Either if those kept you moving without being able to control anything.
---
Being lazy is probably why he only has 300$ to spend on a *gaming laptop*
---
You’re*
---
And if you say so. Look it up. Heals can’t miss. You’re just low IQ trolling at this point.
---
Seeing stuff like this really makes me want to play again but i already sacrificed 2006-2010 to this game.
---
Shit If you're on Incendius, Sons of Thrall is going to start recruiting for raids for midnight server time some time this month.
---
Well yes that’s part of the social aspect. So when you find a trustworthy guy you know they’re trustworthy and friendly. 
---
Sometimes you get crooks but then just ignore and remember their name, put ss on discord’s etc to blacklist the guy. Honestly if you spread the info enough he probably suffers more than you
---
Everyone of those guys is an armchair general until it’s time for them to tank, then they usually crumble under the pressure.  That is why they play dps.  They aren’t worth your time.
---
First one I saw on Gandling went up for 500g
---
Grats on the gquit
---
What about your ret set?
---
yeah, you pay the right guy $20 and 8 hours later you're blue
---
wait... what?
---
LOL  you are one of those people got it. Not trolling general question.. most people never argued they were generally curious and asking questions no one stated I was wrong really. Get off the thread
---
Short answer: no
---
I've always rolled on DPS gear as the tank since forever. I also can't recall a single instance of people complaining about it either.
---
That's FG, not GZ
---
The second one seemed to get pretty choppy, the first one seemed to be pretty smooth. Are you sure you didn't get them backwards?
---
‘Even good gear looks bad in classic’
---
Then why the fuck would you want/care about transmog in the first place you moron?  LOL
---
Full tier sets look amazing.  If you don’t think so, that’s your opinion.  But you are going to look exactly like the gear you are wearing whether you like it or not.
---
Genuinely not to trying to be a jerk but this just seems so snowflakey. Idk your age but if you are an adult and allow other plebs to ruin an excellent game for you by just nerdy troll communication you may find a lot of other confrontations difficult in life. I think if you tried maybe a bit more you could find a cool guild that ya vibe with and then you can just rock with those people. Idk I guess I just don’t think you should allow others to steal your joy. Besides, other than the pixels your seeing they basically don’t exist in your life. Ya know, metaphysically speaking.
---
I'm a  mage, today i tried to kill a shaman that was farming my mobs....boy did i get my ass handed back to me at full force...
---
I certainly don’t have to accept your opinion when you think someone wanting their character to look cool is something that ruined wow. Now that’s a “bad” opinion. I’m a mostly pre-raid bis rogue with a krol blade and I look fucking stupid lmao. I can understand people not wanting transmog in classic because of #nochanges, but transmog certainly didn’t hurt retail.
---
You mean 4 months?
---
Hmm that makes sense. As of when Classic released they were waiting for everybody to kind of “stabilize” in their respective servers so they could cut layers until there’s one for each?
---
IMHO, having a level 40 tauren druid you enjoy playing is going to be better for you than grinding out a level 60 warlock that you are "meh" about.  You aren't competing for server first progression/achievements so why stress it?
---
Other standard responses.
---
* Play the class and role that you want to play and gives you the most enjoyment.
---
* Launch is over.  Don't worry about being "behind" the progression curve or what others are doing.  Classic is more about the journey then the end game destination
---
In classic, just like in Vanilla, DPS are a dime a dozen.  If I’m not enjoying a run because of some arrogant dps ruining my fun, I’ll just kick them or find another group to tank for.  I have no qualms whatsoever doing so, I won’t enable bad behaviour.
---
It’s a scumbag move for sure.
---
Maybe I should’ve used quotes. The point was the Need selection in game is generally considered Need as in usable. NOT Need as in “need” gold. The fact that they are Needing an unusable item is in actuality a “greedy” thing to do. I understand the option to need it is there in case nobody in the group really needs it, or maybe needs it for an alt. But I would much prefer the game would only let someone that can actually use it be able to Need it like they do in FFXIV. If nobody can use it then a Greed would win.
---
Your details are insane; the small difference in the eyes makes him seem super crazy. Love your style!
---
Stop whining, warriors are tanks in classic. Deal with it.
---
That's not what projecting means. Quote me where I said you were ignorant. Is English you 3rd language or maybe you have a learning disability?
---
Anyone know the rogue going price for the Dark Whelping pet?
---
Not really
---
The only thing I would factor in is the fun I am having. Do you have more fun with druid ? Play druid. 
---
Do you have more fun focusing on one character ? Multiple character ?
---
These kind of questions always seem weird to me. It's a game do what you think is fun.
---
Then why is there specs in the first place? Why does the Warrior have a talent tree named "Protection" if not to tank? Yes, a class can be better at a role than another, and they can decide to try and tank in a different spec. But you're wrong about one thing. Warriors are **NOT** obliged to tank. It's very clear how the class is intended. The class can be either DPS or Tank, and the player can choose whichever, at whatever level they want. 
---
I say this as a warrior tank. Trying to force the concept that someone has to play a role they don't want to play because it *can* benefit the group is a shitty thing to do.
---
It has nothing to do with retail. People like you don't understand that a class is not a role, and a role can be chosen by the player who plays the class.
---
LMAOOOO
---
The problem is Warriors are both THE tank class *and* THE dps class in classic
---
 Neat detail I just noticed for the first time today, first time playing  again since cataclysm and it's interesting seeing thing's I missed even  after so many playthroughs.
---
Oh actually fuck off with your condescension.
---
When I feel like grouping up, i do. When I prefer to solo, which is often, I will do that
---
I’ve yet to see one that’s actually funny.
---
Lesson learned, I'm sure!  Stick to killing warriors haha.
---
Yup same
---
You know you guys can save a post? No need to comment.
---
No, no, they are not. They may both be technically not-incorrect, but that is not the same as “acceptable.”
---
Yeah. Rattlegore is super fucked. Spent the night in feralas farming herbs and ran into more than 20 horde and around 5 alliance players. Only got team ganked once because im level 54, but im pretty sure those census addons were wildly inaccurate and horde are more dominant than thought
---
I don't think everyone should roll need to combat loot ninjas..
---
I think everyone should roll need because BoE's have the exact same value for everyone.
---
It just happens to make it impossible to ninja and is ultimately fair for everyone. BoE's don't need to be equipped on the spot, so there's no real reason to arbitrarily require it.
---
Honestly it’s best to have 2 factor on your account. Even if you logon anywhere else they can be pretty sure it’s you. Also yeah public computer...
---
You cannot proof to them you weren’t the one cheating from the cafe pc.
---
Did you know warlocks; who are commonly regarded as having some of the best looking tier sets have god awful set pieces and bonuses and they’re better off just using greens with shadow damage on them? Didn’t you reply to my other comment a second ago saying greens look like trash and they let you know who you can gank?Oh no! How are you gonna know which warlocks you can kill if you can’t tell if they’re in BIS shadow damage greens or just greens from quests?!? Nice way of backing up your argument by resorting to insults as well dude.
---
No, hes tanking if hes the better tank
---
That’s too bad. It’s still an amazing resource!
---
According to the post they made a few hours ago that is no longer the case in any servers which is why even the largest ones are down to a pair and about a dozen are already down to 1. And a server isn't going to be able to support a million 60's in the end game zones when they all get there, all using layering at all does is encourage the creation of player populations the server can;t support once they it is removed.
---
Of the eagle is the best, coming from a warlock
---
Nah, but honestly you can cheat it if you have the money by buying the drops off the elementals off of the AH, i think i paid around 4g for all of them.
---
The trolls are level 32-34 i beleive so you could solo them at 30 i'd say, it would take a while though.
---
Just need someone to help you with cyclonian though who is a 40 elite, i just asked a guildie.
---
GL, weapon is a beast.
---
if there are 4 loot goblins in the group, nothing's gonna stop them from needing. ffs.

i didnt quest it D: im deep prot now so questing is horrible. il try though.
---
Dick
---
My guild and I.
---
If you want to look cool go earn it. It’s part of the process that people enjoy about classic.
---
I would leave no question asked. You're a tank and you've put the effort to get prepared for raiding, you'll have no probleme finding a guild that value your time.
---
Right? Everyone knows what “secret television is” 😂
---
I’m happy this game has brought back a lot of the original players. It’s so obvious the people that are new to the game. It’s cute. 
---
Disclaimer: my memory is crap and I don’t remember a lot from 13 years ago but it’s cool how it comes back.
---
Except rogue boxes arent BIS items. Cant disagree on the "cash is fair play" argument either, specially if its a mage item, cause im a tank and honestly fuck mages
---
Some solid items though
---
well the way you have phrased your posts, gives the impression that you are in the greed if greed, need then equip group.
---
If you aren't, well maybe re-read your first post because you certainly are in the roll greed camp.
---
Where'd you get it?
---
Woman!  I just did the swim with my night elf like 2 weeks ago - it's WAY better than that corpse run through the Wetlands.
---
1. People have been playing Classic Private servers for around 13 years.  I don't think it's just a fad.  There are no **current** plans for post-Naxx content.  I'm personally hoping for the next 2 expansions.  Others want new content.  Some just want Classic.
---
2. Retail WoW is designed to quickly push you into the most recent expansion's content.  In fact, you get one character boosted to level 110 when you purchase the expansion.
---
3. I believe there are Oceanic servers, but not necessarily dedicated Aussie servers. 
---
Since you're looking at both Classic and Retail, let me give you a bit of a breakdown:
---
* Classic is about the adventure, Retail is about the story.  The story is told better in Retail, but experienced better in Classic.
---
* In Classic you are an adventurer, in Retail you are a Hero.
---
Paladin was killing the air elementals in Arathi, so being the good little shaman I am the first thing I do is spam purge and start auto attacking while my warrior buddy catches up. Cpt Genius decides his best option is to flee when we very rapidly drop his health - through the field of lightning bolting, earth shocking mobs without using Divine Shield. We happily watch him take the durability hit
---
How was disc/holy leveling?
---
You can. Undercut is one of the other addons that comes along with auctioneer, like Enchantrix. Check the tooltip settings for Undercut specifically. I would screenshot it for you but I'm on mobile.
---
The difference being that NCOs are expected to adapt the plan whenever necessary.
---
Literally click the link op posted, he rages for a while but then apologizes saying he’s just frustrated. 
---
Not that the nerd rage isn’t super toxic, but at least he apologizes.
---
the question is: would rag be immune to sick burns?
---
Just got pattern: truefaith vestments. What's it worth? AH has it at 150g. (won it off a greed roll)
---
Yes i did... I actually just deleted my entire WoW folder and every addon off of my computer and tried to relaunch WoW and still no Addon button.... im totally out of ideas.
---
what addon is that for the stats?
---
42 and barely free time
---
You do have to accept it when it’s part of the game dipshit.  Just like if I were to play retail now I would have to accept transmog because it’s in the game.
---
And yes, a lot of people do think transmog hurt retail, because it did.  It allows shitters to feel cool and awesome when they shouldn’t.  And this is coming from someone who doesn’t have the time to get that cool looking gear anymore.  But that’s what made the game great.  In wotlk when I was full season 8 gear with t2 weapon people would literally sit there and inspect my character all day while I waited on ques.  Transmog got rid of that because everyone got to play dress up with their trash gear on.
---
Oh, lesson not learned at all, i will still try to kill every horde i see. I will die or i will succeed, but you can be damn sure i'll still try !
---
Don't worry, half the sub is going to need on it because apparently "you're an entitled little shit who doesn't deserve upgrades".
---
Their words.
---
Never got to hear that myself. I was on dialup so I never got to the point I could enter 40 mans - even AV was too much for that connection so I had to stay away from battle just skinning wolves and back capping.
---
20 man ZG was already 800-1200 ping, then if I was asked to get on vent to hear instructions, it would go up to 5000+  so that was a huge restriction.  TBC made it easier by a bit but I still had difficulty keeping rotations going in SSC and Gruul's Lair. 
---
I did get upgraded internet for WOTLK release but only played it for the first content patch before leaving.
---
It's all bs. Guilds have their cliques. You're just fodder for them.
---
Auctioneer or TSM should work I think
---
Probably your only chance is to open a ticket and hope a GM takes pity.
---
Your playstyle could be called greedy as well. You are depriving everyone a shot at 100g because you get an upgrade you can use. Just because what you get is stats instead of GOLD, that people seem to automatically associate with greed because its money, doesnt make it more valid. Its all numbers in a game. Your numbers arent more justified than mine. I can get stats too with that item even if i cant equip it.
---
Also, Im advising everyone to need on BOEs, im not trying to take advantage of it, and youre insinuating that I would need after someone greeded. That IS ninja looting, no one argues that here.  I just think that expensive BOEs are a jackpot item and everyone should get a shot at it, and everyone should just roll need on them to avoid getting screwed over by ninjas or uninformed people, because of a flawed system.  
---
And of course there is a difference between a 5g item and a 100g item, dont be naive... If it was a 5g item you needed you could have bought it already... But why should you get to save 100g on an upgrade over your teammates.
---
Yeah, you can judge how good a person is based on appearance.
---
Imagine seeing an enemy in dungeon gear, you're in tier 2, think this is an easy kill...SIKE! Hes rank 14 with transmog
---
But is it actually extortion if you don't have any kind of leverage?
---
it's not retarded, i think it's just pure stubborn-ness.
---
They refuse to think about the logic for needing, plus you have the fact that the person who can equip it would never have received it if it hadn't been for the group. 
---
open world is murkier, but you literally wouldn't have seen the item if it was not for the group, therefore, the item is 'available' to the whole group as everyone can use it (in some way). Just because 1 character can equip it, means jack.
---
So you just call everyone a snowflake? I'm as far from that as you can get.
---
That's not what I'm trying to say. 
---
A linear increase in player density results in a exponential, multiplicative increase in network congestion.
---
You can't just simply add servers to help this, because there ultimately needs to be one master server reference.
---
When you get to a certain point, you have to make compromises. Culling people at a certain distance, reducing position updates, nowadays layering/phasing.. stuff like that. But if you still put a ton of people in one spot, all doing abilities that require processing and bandwidth, it's still going to break down.
---
Private servers had these problems too despite your insistence otherwise.
---
Actual vanilla was much worse. A standard raid fight that would run smoothly in classic would crash the vanilla server.
---
As a holy priest who just got their truefaith, what should I respec as my 2nd profession?

---
This one through me off course.
---
Yeah thats a pretty good point. Depending on how quickly that first add goes down, the tank should not be worried about keeping aggro on that target. Then by the time you move onto the next target the warrior has solid aggro on all of them.
---
It's not about how you look to yourself. It's about how others see you.
---
Would you compromise that you can get transmog, but the only player that can see it is you? Maybe people who have you on friends list?
---
Like a mod thay changes your tier 1 gear to look like tier 2 gear? Only people with that mod can see the changes.
---
Thanks for this!
---
I could explain the actual logic behind it but I’m guessing you won’t get it. 
---
Look up the prisoners dilemma and maybe you’ll be able to figure it out.
---
on my server i would ask someone to run it on horde side around the same time as me, there were about 11k online players between horde/alliance and only 2 layers.
---
Thank you!
---
You are bored. Time for a new coat of paint.
---
You're saying Blizzard is lying in a blue post? That's pretty edgy. I'd love to hear how you know "for a fact" that there were 3+ layers.
---
When did Blizzard last lie?
---
I think a lot of central time zone went EST since those servers are physically located in Chicago, a central time zone city lol
---
It's less than 1/20th of my health pool in the 40s.
---
My mom
---
it really doesn't, I got the mace out of sheer luck then the scepter same run, when I was initially only hoping for the staff. If I had to farm full runs for that shit I would be in brd farming for the next month
---
Real pvpers don’t act this way in my experience.  Its always the casuals / pve dragonslaying nerds that are dabbling in pvp who over-react, because they’re not used to the “drama” of pvp and take it too personally - instead of simply avoiding the fight or finding a way to get even.
---
He literally straight up told you twice that it wasn't his.
---
Getting gear from dungeons isn't hard, every dungeon grp loves a mage. 
---
Raids however you will have to accept that it can take a long time, you'll have atleast 5 other mages and have to compete with all other casters on trinkets and rings etc.
---
In your skills you have one called "beast mastery".  Open this and you can train your pet
---
Not a bad tradeoff for being able to play the first week and not have dead servers after the first month I say!
---
If someone actually needs the item, they would have already bought it off the auction house, right?
---
Loaded question. It's very fun to play, to me the most fun. The burst and utility is the best thing about it. Lacks some control but you can still do some neat things. Chain lightning and clear casting procs sounds pretty nice. Talents eye of the storm is neat but the crit talents are king. For more info or more in depth answers tune into the stream some time. Enhance is very fun too tho! gl
---
Don't add fuel to the fire.
---
The only way to find out for yourself is to just try it. If you don't like it, you will return to another character with more excitement.
---
So two warriors, one with hands and 100g, one with no hands and 600g.
---
The hands drop. The warrior with 600g just automatically deserves the hands? He deserves 600g and the hands, just bc he LACKED INITIATIVE to utilize the AH and buy himself an upgrade? I'm sorry but in this case if the warr with 600g acted entitled to the hands they would be just that, entitled.
---
I was in a ZF grp on my lock and underworld band dropped but I had the decency to say "all need" right away.
---
I remembered quite a few voice lines, especially from SM, but the that always stuck with me the most was Hakkar in ZG: "Pride heralds the end of your world. Come, mortals! Face the wrath of the Soulflayer!"
---
Really don't need a shield for most of the packs and taking more damage actually helps you generate enough rage to keep up with the DPS slamming as much damage in as possible.
---
Without shield spec/imp shield block there's not a whole lot of point to running the shield. Chances are you're not going to block enough damage to really smooth out your spikes. Keep one around for bosses/sticky situations but expecting a shield to make a significant difference in most content up to SM is just gonna give you grey hairs.
---
My guild has done it 2 times for ony buff, send a scout out if there is a huge group there find someone in the guild to layer us - then again we are outnumbered by horde 2-1 so it might be less useful on other servers/factions. Maybe a better example is capital city raids, city raids are essentially a vanity thing and its pretty much lost when 1/2 of the potential victims are in another layer. Setting up world PVP events is also a nightmare 
---
"hey why wernt you at tarren mill at 6pm?" 
---
"we were! where were you? pussies!"
---
Because everyone’s HS is set in IF by the time they are 60
---
Not bad. Kept a “solo leveling” gear set on me and swapped to +healing gear for dungeons starting around 30. Wand spec/spirit tap is very strong. Respec’d talents at 55 to ditch them. Fortunately, I benefitted from the 10-man dungeon farm at SM pre-nerf and up to 46 before the demo shout nerf (ZF cleaves). Getting into groups was very easy as a healer. All-in-all, easier leveling story than my RL rogue friend.
---
Been very happy on Incendius tbh, its high, there was some ques, but its been very enjoyable hardships
---
I don't understand. It's working every time, unless it's a bug. Casting Aimed Shot during the Red charge up allows auto shot to keep charging as if nothings happened. Casting Aimed shot after auto shot makes you wait til you shoot the aimed shot to charge. What else is there?
---
If they do that, then you'll just bitch about bad tanks, lmao. The people who don't want to tank are especially prone at being bad at it.
---
A class isn't a role. That's why there are specs. And just because someone *can* doesn't mean jack shit. I *can* just pull the mobs on purpose and do nothing and let the party rue the chaos. Warriors aren't tanks. Warriors are a class than have the **OPTION** to tank or DPS. That's how it was intended.
---
It's about how others compare their strength to you. 
---
Trinkets are pretty trivial and for the most part you can predict that which ones they have.
---
I've seen that statue a dozen times turning in Hydraxian Waterlords quests, but what I never noticed is shortly before it by the bridges is a crystalized troll. I stood there for 15 seconds just staring at him and wondering what the hell he was planned for, there are no trolls in Azshara or any of the neighboring zones.
---
This is incorrect.  
---
There is no such thing as the pet training window, and you are likely going to cause OP to go looking in his pet character screen with its stats, or its ability screen with its skills.  
---
The correct answer is to open player skills, select beast mastery, and that is where he can train his active pet.
---
at 720p though I guess
---
Nailed it.
---
You're correct. Need is for gear and greed is for gold.
---
So does this mean the player base has dropped like crazy since release?
---
This happened to me joining a trash run. Now I can’t join guild run tomorrow...  not even a warning. Feels really bad
---
Shadow. Priests.
---
Because you can't buy bop gear off the AH.
---
See, you literally can't 'need' boes, because if you actually needed it, you would have already bought it.
---
Except what happens when BGs come out and the market gets flooded with twink blues that everyone is holding onto?
---
Amen, end of discussion.
---
Yeah he was being tongue in cheek playing that character. Dont be so sensitive
---
Sorry, a day late so I hope this gets some views.
---
Resubbed a few weeks ago - 22 Shaman, 19 Hunter, 14 Mage, 8 Warlock. I was a MT prot warrior in Vanilla-Ulda, second toon was mostly a warlock, but I've dinged 80 on every class. I just don't have time to be a MT again, but still want to see raiding. 
---
I like the Shaman for it's versatility, but it's a bit dull to play. Enhancement leveling is a lot of waiting for white hits and shock timers, but at least everyone likes them to heal in raids. I've known some amazing mages and hunters over the years, so I'd love to really dive into either class. Warlock is only an option because I'd love to go back and do the class quests I didn't do in vanilla, and that class I already mostly know how to rock the dps and PVP. 
---
Idk, I just can't freaking decide, so I play a different toon each night, really enjoying it, but next log in I'm lookin at the screen and goin, "oh... I should really play that one instead..." I don't give a crap about FOTM class or topping all the charts, I just want to be needed by a raid guild.  I'm Horde on Azuresong, if that makes any difference.
---
I have only encountered one rogue so far that knows that Crippling Poison is a thing. So many instances are easier with some form of mob slow, and Crippling Poison on the OH is one of the easiest ways of doing this.
---
Considered a warlock? Caster with a pet!
---
Click on any of those and they say added in phase 6. The ilvl 63 ones say added in phase 2, like this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=361/champions-pursuit
---
Click any of those.
---
i tank - when i can be bothered to.
---
what i don't like, is seeing another war in the group. I don't join those groups XD
---
The only thing I can think of then is Winterspring, Burning Steppes and then onto Plaguelands
---
It's been on the game since vanilla, so why?
---
Idk if hand of justice is trivial man. An extra swing on an enh sham or arms warrior will outright kill you if it crits.
---
Theres alot of mages, but every group loves a mage. So even if there is a lot of you there is high demand for mages. Especially good ones.
---
Not in the era of instant gratification. Act now - sacrifice later.
---
Oh yeah there's that too. Weave that shit in Hunter style.
---
Bans were only given out to the people who were using it to respawn raid bosses within a single lockout. No one was banned for layer hopping to grind mobs or mine or herb or whatever.
---
1 or 2 games, fine. But if you're subjecting yourself to toxicity *over and over* it becomes exhausting, even with the thickest skin. And unfortunately, there seem to be toxic players in almost every game.
---
but they already had a tank, they were advertising for a dps not a tank
---
Renew is actually very mana inefficient.
---
You can do better though. People CAN care about you, it doesn't have to be this way.
---
This. You shouldn’t have much trouble, as tanks are in very short supply.
---
chances are it wont proc and is a waste of a trinket slot. PvP trinket, and AB trinket are the usual loadout for pvp
---
Typical magetard response
---
It seems it’s not a pug for the gnomies though
---
if you were a normal player it wasnt that big a deal, i did it a little bit in STV, but yeah
---
That's why the leadership structure is the way it is though. Commanders can't run everything, so they task it out to subordinates. It's just efficient (assuming you have good subordinates/good commanders that give their subordinates enough leeway so they can accomplish commanders intent).
---
I’m new to wow . Lvl 30 warrior spent my entire day today helping people with counterattack and Issa awak quest. Payin it forward
---
there's an item restoration service that you can use every 15 days to re-obtain any deleted or vendored item
---
If you get it you'll mostly use it to stand around showing off in orgrimmar how cool it looks.
---
Ah, my bad.
---
Main is a 23 Dwarf Hunter going Skinning + Leatherworking, alt is a 12 Dwarf Paladin going Mining + Skinning and 12 Gnome Mage going Herbalism + Alchemy.
---
The thing here is that I want a profession that will make me feel “useful” for other players while making some money (no need to be RICH, just don’t wanted to be broke) and that’s useful even after hitting 60.
---
I have the impression that going Leatherworking will be useful for me and my party while leveling and going for pre-raid BiS BUT after this it won’t be useful at all.
---
Should I keep my hunter with Skinning + Leatherworking or try Mining + Skinning til 40~50 then go Mining + Engineering? 
---
(Any suggestions on what to do with my alts is appreciated as well)
---
Thanks!
---
I sense jealousy lol. Sorry your mom doesn't cook nice things for you
---
Thanks for that! Was looking for a birthday gift for my buddy
---
Can you buy a bop off the auction house?
---
You don't have to eat after every mob unless you're fighting enemies that aren't level appropriate. Spirit Regen only occurs out of combat meaning travel time between enemies, you will still need to eat eventually between enemies unless they are spaced extremely far apart.  This means spirit is only really beneficial if it allows you to kill an additional enemy before having to stop to eat. If added crit or AP would allow you to kill even one enemy one swing faster it ends up evening out having to eat for one tick longer.
---
Spirit benefit is really good, a lot better than it was given credit for back in the day, it is not some kale/acai/chia seed super food of  stats.
---
Ours will randomly yell "Blunt check!" And then it's time for everyone to dab up.
---
there is no need for 1h+shield for dungeons below 58 (and you can do the 60 dungeons w/o one, although they may require a bit more coordination - idk this for sure, just heard it around)
---
Tl;dr someone much more dedicated than I did the math and concluded you could easily spend 8 hours a day for 2700 days running Strath Undead before you get it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csxnzn/psa_you_should_not_try_to_farm_deathchargers/

It’s pretty bullshit. Like do they really expect that people would never log in outside of their home country?
---
Baaah giving me nightmares about doing this quest back in the day. Had to have guildies help with that ritual since no one else wanted to. And here I am rolling lock again 14 years later.
---
The whole attraction to classic, for me at least, is enjoying the journey.  Playing the warlock cause it's higher level,  but less fun, is going to drag on you in the long run.  
---
I'd play the druid if your enjoying more, your lock isn't going anywhere.  In the meantime he's a great bank alt.
---
insane at 1:40pm est. Kirtones server I went to badlands and looked around and nothing. afkd for a couple minutes came back and brokentooth was in that same spawn. i was freaking out. mainly because i had camped him a coupe weeks ago but got killed by horde scum. I caught him and i am happy and i will unleash him on all the horde
---
F in chat for our brother.
---
Doubtful. You're saying blizzard should merge or they lose money. Grow the f up.
---
Have to have engi for pvp and took mining to level engi easier.
---
If you actually needed BoP gear, you would keep running the instance until you beat everybody in a roll. Doesn't matter if you're going to equip it, I need the vendor gold too. I need the vendor gold to buy my BoE epics. So really you could say every piece of loot that drops is one step towards my BiS gear, so I'm going to roll need on everything.
---
See how this goes? 
---
I know you understand need vs. greed. You're trying to justify your greed, that's it.
---
Shit I’m not even 50 yet.
---
was this on kirtones? because ur posting lines up right when it would have spawned again
---
We're both wrong. 
---
It's called Beast Training. Not Pet Training or Beast Mastery.

Obviously:
---
- Druid
---
- War

And, at a distant 3rd:

- Shamans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKQnV-kpDhU
---
Oh you are right, it works like that on retail only
---
I have a fiancé, but sure, I'm jealous of your dumb ass posting fucking cupcakes on the internet.
---
It is and Blizzard take it really seriously too. Back in MoP a friend had moved to horde on the same server. One night were getting shitfaced and we decided to whisper people jokingly, saying shit like hey haha ive got ya in my sights pay up or else, didnt take more than 1 hour before I got a 2 day ban
---
Some of the first 60s on the server but you didnt *rush*, yet took you almost a month...so probably not the first 60s. You dont even know where you are anymore with this argument.
---
They don't have to accept it, because it's not relevant. Those people need to learn that a class isn't a role and not to **EXPECT** others to tank when they cry for a DPS.
---
People didn't know about PrtSc then^^^/s, it's important that it stays that way even now.
---
#\#NoChanges
---
Was that you or something? Nobody cares to see an apology after 4 pages of 12 year old bullshit.
---
I’d say keep your mage. Personally I really like the ideia of summon water/food and the portals. And the AoE is just delicious so yeah.
---
Underwater breathing for people in desolace farming the traps.
---
No, you're wrong, sorry bro.
---
Or he mistakenly targeted the wrong player.  As it’s the easiest explanation.
---
KOS lists work when you don't use them for kill-on-sight.
---
They're great for letting you know when you should corpse camp someone for an otherwise unreasonable amount of time. Since the faction divide is already a KOS filter and you *should* be aggressive, a note that reminds you that you should ramp that up to 11 is handy.
---
On Herod, and I only started a day ago, but mining has been a nightmare once I got up in level to where people are actually farming it (so mithril and up).  I can circle Ungoro multiple times without a single node.  I’m sure her bing is just as bad.  
---
Honestly, something’s gotta give, because the economy cannot support the demand for these mats with supply as low as it’s about to be with no layers.  Thorium is just so rare at this point.
---
Exactly this. People who compare needing to sell on AH to needing to vendor are literally just creating this ridiculous strawman argument.  
---
When you are vendoring, you are effectively "trashing" the item. That is the main difference. Where as with a BoE that item will benefit another player on your faction. It will help bolster an active and vital economy. It does contribute to the social aspects of an MMO.   
---
These are the main points people miss when they make the strawman "well let me just need on everything BoE or BoP hurr durr how is needing on all BoP's any different?" All the people who make that argument sound the same and they all sound retarded.
---
I rolled a warrior with the intention of tanking all my dungeons. I'm so fed up with dps not waiting for aggro. So I'm dps now. If dps want warriors to tank they need to learn how to manage their threat and treat the tank with some damn respect. So many dps will pull mobs for whatever reason. If they want to pull so bad then they can tank.
---
I think the level 58 death knight is a parody of the people that hate everything about retail and think vanilla was the best thing wow has ever had. And how am I being the sensitive one? The guy insulting me was the one that got so angry he started flinging insults like a child.
---
Oh good, at least OP should be OK now :P
---
Cheers
---
I love this, thank you for uploading the maps.
---
That’s a Texas sized 10-4
---
Yup. I haven't trained the additional ranks yet lol.
---
Exactly.. wtf? If you were to act out like this in real life you'd get your ass kicked or have the police called for disorderly conduct. No need to act like a childish chode, apology or not.
---
Did he give your ass the succ?
---
I mean you didn't even address the point.
---
You can be obtuse all you want, but I'm going to be over here rolling need on the boe epic with the other 3 people in the party and you are going to be rolling greed.
---
Okay Eeyore
---
It's so naive to actually believe *random* people respect the need/greed system when it comes to valuable BoEs. Even if a person could use some BoE that dropped, he can just not equip and put it in AH. Nobody in their right mind is going to equip a 500g+ BoE on their alt if they need gold for their mains epic mount/gear. Everyone needing is the fairest way if you play with strangers.
---
Yep that's about it.
---
I do it so I can empathize with the tank.
---
Three tank classes for best faction.
---
Yeah and he was channeling that character as a joke.
---
It was a joke. You taking it seriously makes you sensitive
---
Real girls have dicks mate
---
Yeah that sucks dude.
---
Do you have alt 3 bound already
---
It’s can’t be. I was in Mara, rez’d my target went to heal. Target never changed and it just got like “absorbed” the heal disappeared... my mana went away I was 2 feet from him and we were out of combat I triple checked everything.

Next time it happens I’m going to check the logs and re posting this cause I’m sure it will say healed for 0 also
---
I had an Alliance mage watching me outside the entrance to Uldaman today. I ended up pulling too many guys and wasn’t going to make it... he walks over, waits a little bit, and did his best to get the killing blow so I didn’t take the durability hit. thanks dude!
---
Did you report him?
---
&gt; However,if you need on BOE gear that you won't wear, you're showing that you cannot be trusted. 
---
???
---
I don't trust anyone in a pug anyways, that is why in every pug we all roll need.
---
seems like they are very aggressive on account selling, so they probably just ban any account that doesn't play in the same ip address.
---
So do priest shields still ignore melee crits?

Thank you for your input
---
Big oof.
---
Thank you  so much!
---
There will be less warlocks in raids at level 60, plus it has amazing group utilities like summoning heal &amp; spirit stone.
---
It's also a really really good pvp class.
---
Supply and demand my friend
---
There isn't really going to be that kind of stuff for HK farming, its going to be camping popular flight points with sappers and aoe.
---
Yeah you will need tons of memory to visualise the 400mb one. Even the high quality jpeg will be a problem for most phones
---
And thats a case where having a lot of RAM is good folks
---
I learned to enjoy lol by not listening to toxic people and pretending it's a handicapped 4v5 Match.
---
I've won so many games where we were 4v5 by not letting people rage me out.
---
Ill try this when I get home
---
As far as I remember, nothing. A GM started looking into it and will possibly contact the OP if anything comes up. No new news regarding it.
---
No... they arent.
---
I don't inspect anybody in modern WoW but I definitely inspect people in classic
---
I mean, your logic is just flawed. If transmog ruined the game for letting bad players look like good players by wearing great gear that's hard to obtain.......... how did they obtain the gear to use for transmog in the first place? They obviously earned it. Its not like you can transmog your Soldier's Axe of the Boar into Ashbringer at level 15 anyway.
---
The "recognizing PVP and raid players" is ridiculous anyway. If you're in a battleground, running away from a geared player is not an option unless you want to make no impact to the BG. If you're in the open world, maybe you can make someones gear out before you jump them, but skill still trumps gear. And if you're getting jumped by a fully geared rogue it was over before it started regardless.
---
Yeah I spammed SM from like 29-42 tbh
---
Is there anyway to just combined the two boxes?
---
Well if you worried about falling behind being lvl 36 you are already behind. End game content is cool and all but it’s not all the game has to offer. Based on the speed your going you probably won’t enjoy end game content that much so play what you like. I will say only playing to level 10 is not a good measure of wether you really like a character or not but that’s just my opinion. And let’s say you get to 20 and are like “hmmmm Druid is kinda boring” its no big deal to start another. People will constantly be leveling alts and there are still new people starting everyday at that. Classic isn’t going anywhere and even if they add to classic past the original phases that won’t be for a long time. One thing I will say though is your definitely gonna want something that’s 50+ by the time phase 2 comes out (don’t know when that will be) because the gank station will be in full force at that point. But still there’s no rush. Unlike retail the fun of classic comes from leveling once you hit 60 there really isn’t a whole lot to do other then grind faction rep or gold and raid and that’s something you can only do once a week anyways. A benefit though to pushing a little further on your main though is having more gold that you can funnel to your alt which things a little easier and sometimes more fun when your not consistently worrying about wether you have enough gold for that skill or maybe you really need an upgrade and wanna buy something off the AH. I’ve recently started focusing on 2 characters I have my main and an alt that I enjoy playing both. Will that slow my progress? Yes but I find it fun switching between 2 characters I enjoy instead getting burn out on one.
---
LoL is actually really great if you mute the whole lobby at the start of each round.
---
So you're just ignoring when the conversation turned to population caps.
---
May I ask why?
---
Lmao 😂 are you on grobbulus?
---
Threw*
---
Shaman Warrior?
---
Does it not give the warning like it used to? You have to accept a disclaimer that you're accepting the lockout when you zone in?
---
Pretty crazy if not
---
Blizzard should have been more careful with this option already though.
---
What's happening, on Skeram for example, is all of the Alliance are using it to leave the server since they are out numbered, causing an even bigger imbalance. 
---
Blizzard should only have let the higher populated faction transfer off for free.
---
yeah the first one is very smooth. Except nobody is moving or doing anything and it takes like 30s for any hp bars or positions to update, yet on the pserver one that happens within 0.1s even if it's laggy.
---
I have my own "KOS" list of people who did stupid shit to me and deserve to die.
---
High level ganking lowbies and questgivers? I'll kill you a few times if I spot you when we're at the same level.
---
Rogue and Mage combo only 2v1 and only fight on their terms? (it's world pvp, so it's kinda fair but still) Yeah, I'll kill you when I see you.
---
For me it's something I do for fun. Imagine running around and suddenly you see a familiar name; you open up your list and see that whoever you spotted is on it. You walk up to them, kill them, and then you feel a lot better because you got revenge for when they did X against you.
---
I think that's how a large majority of people see it.
---
So I guess you saying i'm sensitive over and over again disregards my argument. Got it! Just like how you said Hand of justice is wasting a trinket slot. Guess my rogue is better off just not equipping it.
---
Deadmines levels off a bit
---
No, the guild supplied some and he bought the rest from other guilds.
---
I'm a tank warrior. It doesn't matter how high in demand a tank is, it plays differently and people don't have to play it if they don't want to.
---
Also, acting like every warrior wanting a tank are annoying is ignoring the fact that they just might be a shit tank.
---
Thanks! it isnt quite what i normally like but its the best one i can use thats avaliable to me on the twitch launcher
---
Sorry, I'm too old school now. Mesmerize. Basically, crowd control where the target can't do anything (move or use abilities) but which breaks if they take damage or anything like that. Unlike a stun, where they are helpless even if they take damage, or a root, where they are merely unable to move but can otherwise act normally.
---
Zoomers wont even know what this means
---
"Fire can't melt steel beams"
---
Enhance and resto YES
---
Elemental NO
---
Call them, it'll be easier to explain your situation and actually get heard.
---
I bet a bunch of these people change their minds when they only see one epic BoE drop in their entire play time.
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
---
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
---
If it's the US Army, yes
---
And then that same warlock wonders why nobody wants to tank.
---
yeah, does not work for me either.  Really odd but I have had people somehow add me as a battlenet friend.  Really wish I knew how to turn that off, I just want in game character based friends.  I also tried to figure out how they did it thinking maybe it would lead me to a path to turn it off.  No luck,  I can only add my factions players by character name or tag name, but I need to know the tag name to do it.  Weird.
---
Should be 150.
---
No disclaimer, just instantly locks you -- believe the disclaimer was added in Wrath (possibly BC).
---
Yes they are. They so much amongst themselves they wonder why horde rules the servers.
---
&gt; Paladins don't have that ability to fish for procs so thats nice on a warrior.
---
Well, Paladins do get the Seal of Righteousness which effectively doubles their proc chances, and by seal twisting it with Seal of the Crusader you can get some very competitive proc rates even when compared to things like Hunter Wing Clip spamming.
---
Warriors also have exclusive access to the Diamond Flask, which is one of only 3 items that scale with +healing in the game.
---
I generate aggro so much better as prot. Dunno what you are smoking.
---
If I wanted to get this printed out like a poster what size do you think would be best?
---
Find another guild.
---
Four months is way way too long. Eight months of only MC raiding is gonna kill off so many guilds. I'd say three at most. By month four or five people will already be pretty stir crazy. With Blizzcon being at the start of November I'd bet we get the announcement for phase 2 there and it drops one or two weeks after.
---
Lok'tar homie.
---
Do y'all find rogues engaging to play while leveling? I want to play a class that dual wields, but warriors don't unless fury and until deep into 60. Curious if rogues will be a fun class to play throughout all stages, or if they have a super tedious and boring stage.
---
For phalanx you are probably going to have to look for full BRD runs, the from guzzler is at a weird point and usually the only groups that go that way are those hitting emperor and not doing the lava skip.
---
What got you and your wife into WoW? I'm intrigued.
---
How are you both finding it?
---
Same
---
3 minutes apart....2 days later...
---
interesting wording
---
The benefit is the same irregardless. If an item drops worth 400g, it provides the same utility to all members in the party. I'm supposed to give a shitter rando 400gs for free just because they happened to be of the class it would work for? If you need it so badly, make the money and buy it instead of relying on a super low drop rate that is unreliable
---
What, got our armors dirty with their blood? 
---
Silly horde.
---
Tha God himself, fuck dude.
---
A prerequisite? Lmao
---
Wow that sucks. I'll have to be careful.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
For classic as well? I know that’s a retail thing
---
He's not going to respond to logic. He's just flinging insults because he can't argue a point besides that he can't gank people anymore because he can't tell if they're undergeared and that ruined wow for him and "a lot of people".

I want Edgemaster's Handguards. It's my BiS glove, 500g on the AH. You want Briarwood Reed, your BiS trinket, BoP. Gloves are a marginal upgrade for me, trinket is marginal upgrade for you. 
---
I don't have 500g, you don't have Briarwood Reed. If Edgemaster's drops, you want to roll Need. If Briarwood Reed drops, I should also roll need because the gold helps me get to Edgemasters. 
---
Do you follow now? You're trying to justify your greed, plain and simple. A party member needs a piece of gear to equip and because Blizzard made it BoE you think you're somehow equally entitled to it? Ridiculous.
---
He sounds like a tank. If you don't like it then you tank.
---
What about locks?
---
And you’re a ignorant moron who has no idea what’s going on :) take your keyboard warrior by somewhere else
---
30 years hmmm to catch every fish in the sea. Okay challenge accepted.
---
that's an awesome compliment, thank you :3
---
Yup. These days I'd be lucky to get three rounds in, and I'd be flabbergasted if more than one of those was a real game without inting
---
But you said he ran in with 1 mob on his tail?
---
Just FD and start mining?
---
Edit: ahh u wanted him dead. That’s a whole new level of hunter. I must try.
---
Never accept a random friend request, what are you thinking?
---
Nah.  You’re dumb. Goodnight.
---
Night dumb dumb
---
yeessssss &lt;3
---
So everyone should roll need on every item that drops because everything can be sold for gold, right?
---
You say that like Classic goes away after that. :(
---
Lock rocks! And if I'm feeling *extremely* generous a soulstone
---
Yup. Troll.
---
What do you personally find appealing about rogues?
---
It's funny that leeroy is used as a bad example when literally my brother told me that the reason the US army is so terrifying is because they dont stick to the plan. Tactics arent shit when the enemy has split tactics in large numbers
---
Meanwhile, I've got a handful of level 20s on various servers, and can't figure out what to main or where to play.  
---
Oof. Gotta get my butt in gear. lol
---
you bet!  :D
---
I like em to
---
Nope not a troll just don’t understand why you need to take it to personal level lol it has nothing to do with you get lost
---
Thanks man &lt;3
---
Just graveyard. Far as I know, there are one quest asks for 20 hearts of zeal from random mobs, two quests about finding a book in the library, one quest from the dreadlord that sends you kill all four end bosses in the other three wings, but nothing about the graveyard.
---
LoS FTW!
---
thank you! :3
---
Not personal. You’re just stupid. End of file. Stop replaying.
---
I hate the loot system in retail so much. Maybe classic isn't perfect but personal loot is awful.
---
It sounds like you have alt 3 bound to something already. Maybe a specific action bar or something more specific like targetting or a camera keybind.
---
And you’re an Idiot you have no idea what’s happening go away off my post sir
---
There are way to few multiboxers to ruin a realms economy, I think a bunch of people are just salty that some are willing to spend x5 more money and time to set it up and then be ganked by one of these. I'm not worried at all tbh, iv seen one in total and iv played since launch of classic, seems they are not much more common now than what they were before.
---
Dude nice saving this
---
Shit post.
---
Not many people are raiding yet. Just the guys that have nolifed since launch.
---
I don't invite dps Warriors to anything except SM for this reason. If you're a warrior you should almost always be tanking until 60.
---
Yes you are a shit poster good job :)
---
Well stealth as a core mechanic is awesome - allows you to do a lot of stuff other classes couldn’t like passing mobs you wouldn’t like to kill or ambush enemies (and I’m a fan of stealth games so that contributes to feeling).
---
Also I like dual wielding and rogues are aesthetically pleasing for me overall - I like class fantasy.
---
Did you know Hand of justice also gives you 20 attack power? Or how about the chance for hand of justice to proc is 2%? Just like the 2% crit that blackhands gives you. Hand of Justice also procs on sinister strike and eviscerate too! Not just autos! You literally said HoJ is a waste of a trinket slot. That's actually incredibly and impressively wrong. I'm baffled as to how you're gonna explain this when some people are running around with carrot on a stick still.
---
I can very clearly remember it being commonly accepted for everyone to need on all BOE blues and epics during vanilla. It's not hard to communicate with the group and it's pretty much the only way to ensure someone doesn't ninja loot and bail.
---
Maybe it was just different from server to server, but I can't imagine having the kind of trust in a pug required to roll greed on anything of serious value.
---
This reminds me of when I was 12 and got my first boyfriend. I would tell anyone who would annoy me that my boyfriend will beat them up.
---
Elemental do way more damage than enhancement, and in dungeons the mana issues arent as bad.
---
I shoot on the red bar too OP. I found that to be the best time to use aimed shot.
---
And away we go. Your grammar needs some work. Please stop replying. You sound retarded.
---
wait till you see the stockade and the other upcoming alliance posters this month :D
---
So?
---
It will literally show anything that is under vendor if you set it that way.  I buy basically anything -1c from vendor because why not?
---
:3
---
Sadly this. Skillz just like the pve.
---
those 50's adventure novels! &lt;3
---
Pretty sure you used the word Replaying earlier... when you meant replying 
---
Typical keyboard warrior. Goes to personal insults, troll comments and grammar comments... lol you need a life
---
Fight me.
---
Less layers means less server load, less people on the server at a time, the lag is probably because of layering.
---
Ok
---
I believe it's because some people are allowed to grow up with mispronunciation, with no one to correct them, and they just type how they talk.
---
Darn goblins
---
A few times I’ve come across someone in the wild  about to die to a mob, on both sides, and I’m always quick to heal them or dps the mob down for em, it’s part of what being a priest is all about
---
yes! im happy you notice it, they are committed with their leveling &lt;3
---
Thunderfury? =D
---
Maybe because they have to expend all mana healing dumbass 2 hander tanks who die without heals in 2 seconds
---
thank you! &lt;3
---
i think that's a reasonable assumption, i assume most customers are casuals who are rich and just want to get to raid asap
---
idk if im slow or not, but im 120 hours in and im only 49, been doing everything solo so far, can't find a group cause i'm a druid
---
The Tauren of wallstreet
---
&gt;Well, it's not really that hard to understand  
---
&gt;you have a priest tag meaning you only witnessed spellcleave from a priest perspective  
---
&gt;Yikes
---
By this logic, because you currently don't have a flair, this means that you've never played the game.
---
Weird way to shoot yourself in the foot.
---
Obviously the real answer is that I played vanilla during the original 2004-2007 run while I was in high school and know more about this than you, but that's far less interesting than why you think someone's flair on Reddit sums up what they know and only that. I definitely need to hear more about this perspective you take.
---
What other information do you gleam from people's flair?
---
A bunch of neckbeards raiding after no life leveling in the first month doesn’t count as ‘MC time’. And if it does, nobody cares how bored you guys get. :P
---
I play a lot, but also work full time and commute 3hrs a day, and spend a few nights each week doing other stuff and I’m level 54 which is still higher than most players on my server.
---
Don’t fucking aggro all the whelps!
---
Lets be fair. There were a few outspoken individuals. I'm sure a lot of the staff were very open to the idea. And we need to appreciate the nightmare of resurrecting old technology. The code itself is absolutely atrocious by today's standards. Thats why classic still has very noticeable gameplay issues and not just "bugs"
---
I just wanted to see how long this would go on. No hard feelings. Lol
---
Okay, so what you do is; buy it all, and relist at 4000%
---
I had fun lol
---
Auto attacks are useless in pvp. 20 AP isnt much
---
Black hands adds 2% crit to whatever crit you already have. So it's not a 2% chance to crit. It makes a 25% chance into a 27% chance.
---
If you're choice is carrot on a stick or HoJ, yeah take HoJ.
---
But it's not BiS at all, if you had pvp trinkets you take that
---
Oh, in that case no. You can't do that. The other 4 would still respond normally. They'd just stick around or kill you until the one sap wore off. Then put on their follow macro to sync back up.
---
if you guys break up you can rename as knights who say icky icky icky ptang zoop boing?
---
85g on my server would be bought instantly. 20g per leather and rising
---
It's kinda useless. If the boat isn't there. You may as well swim. And if you're a druid you should swim anyway.
---
The boats only faster if it's there when you are. If you don't see the boat, it's faster to swim.
---
You are the only one who pointed it out, would you like the high quality art of one of those posters? lemme know and i'll sent it to you &lt;3
---

That ability can be the difference between being able to a quest, and not being able. But it also shares a CD with shieldwall and recklessness!
---
If /u/IAmAndrewWK taught us anything, it’s that it’s never to early to learn to party
---
Now many of those players (and CoD) have returned to WoW or started anew and brought their newly founded pisspoor attitudes with them.
---
Yeah, I understand. I've been playing league since 2010 and the last couple years I haven't been enjoying as much. It feels like the community has been getting more and more toxic.
---
When someone leaves my guild, people will say "Back to retail"
---
They mentioned today that phase 2 will be out by the end of the year.
---
*Frostwolf*
---
If your spellcleave group in BRD went faster than any other runs, something's wrong with the way you're playing or grouping. As a Priest was did both two spellcleave attempts (mages were shit) and who did it with a proper, protection Warrior and mixed DPS, I can definitely tell you how the mixed group with more resources went far, far faster. Not waiting for Mages to drink up after every pull saves far more time.
---
But please take this in context. You disagree about spellcleave being boring. Cool. There are 9 classes in the game though. It's not a sustainable group to really run and push on people. Many can't do it.
---
Love this. 
---
I met someone in a party who said the weather was getting nasty... asked where he lived, turns out hes 10 minutes from me and the same storm came and dumped on me as well 😂
---
Had just enough time to go and move my Japanese maples under cover
---
This sounds something from TES: Oblivion’s NPCs chatting amongst themselves lol
---
It sounds to me like he or she is #winning
---
Yea, that's how I'm using it pretty much too. It's not any "now I'll spread your name around and you will be on everyone's KOS list! waaah!" but rather a reminder to myself that this dude has ganked me or done some other shit deserving of a gank themselves. 
---
I dislike taking out revenge for ganks on other innocent low levels that has had nothing to do with ganking me and I seldom even initiate PvP (but it's fun to have the thrill of PvP and that's why I'm on a PvP server), so I have the list to remember who has ganked before so I can get revenge and that this dude is fair game to jump when low health/outnumbered etc.
---
This man plays alot
---
Very much this.
---
*Eyebrows rise*
---
I’ve bought herbs in bulk cleared the ah and sold for a profit. Usually 10% or so. If a stack went for 7g I would do 8g. Takes a while to move. Sometimes lost , sometimes have gained . 
---
Undercutting him in bulk if you have and getting those sold would be the best thing to do
---
It makes a ton of sense. Let me know what you're struggling with. I'm always available to help.
---
Something I love about going to Blizzcon is the Horde fans in public places. I’ll be in the Dallas Airport and hear someone yell loudly Lok’tr Ogar. Non-gamers players usually look around anxiously to see if shit is about to go down. To be fair, I might feel the same if something similar happen and I didn’t know what was being yelled.
---
Diablo?
---
This really puts in perspective how massive this world is
---
Yes.. we knew this from day 1 when Blizzard told us they planned to down-port the game to a shard-designed client.
---
We thought maybe a multi billion dollar company would have the foresight to invest some resources into making the client better at handling large scale fights because they WILL happen in Classic.
---
We thought wrong.
---
If only Blizzard had several million of $ rolling in every month to spend on this..... hmmm.
---
Blizzard is trying to deliver Classic with just the bare minimum and it is glaringly obvious how fucking awful the result is.
---
Smae thing happened to my friend in his first mc clear on rattlegore. He was a rogue but there was a fucking 55 druid in the raid who walked out with goddamn 3/8 set that night because he was the only one  LOL
---
If I join a guild and am greeted with "whalecum", I leave.
---
I miss Zug Zug, i left to join a friends guild. ZUG ZUG!!!
---
Reminds me of airline route maps lol
---
Easy there, chief!
---
It's definitely the wrong way when your way of playing doesn't just exclude others but even sees players getting kicked and passed over for a strategy to nowhere. Rogues need gear but I've witnessed twice now two different Rogues get kicked from groups or not invited because people wanted to hold out for mages. I left those groups quick but clearly that's not just a few occurrences.
---
sabaton is actual trash
---
I swapped my chat text to "legendary" color and dont even notice that spam as it doesnt stick out,
---
What do you require ‘knights until recently said Ni’ lol
---
I think it's hilarious
---
n^2
---
That is all.
---
Just /gquit and move on.
---
Howd u get the additional stats??
---
#LookUp
---
The list would be long, but i guess it would all boil down to:
---
"Give players a feeling of being unique, without making them the center of attention in the world"
---
Thats what classic does well, your character feels unique, your journey feels unique and your encounters with other players feel unique, but never once do you feel like the center of the universe.
---
I'm not lost
---
Dungeon set for hunter is meh. But luckily hunter BIS is the raid sets
---
Why the fuck would you respec, tell the whiner to give it a shot while you sit and watch
---
\#showtooltip
---
/dismount
---
/cast Stealth
---
That will let you stealth from a mount. 
---
Having a weapon timer is good because it can let you optimise your strikes. You don't want to start running away from someone when you were a fraction of a second away from hitting them.
---
I used to do that back in classic on my mage, same spot!
---
You need energy timer. Swing timer is not that big of a deal for you.
---
Yeah but the thing is. With the wow community if you could have varying items like weapon speeds and frost can go 2h ect. 
---
People will just fucking sim it all. And if you don’t get the wep best for your class your trash. 
---
“Lol 2h enhance is dogshit” 
---
And slow or fast weapon will be the same deal. 
---
Go ahead and downvote the fuck out of me. But it’s facts and everyone knows it
---
Is energy timer on twitch app
---
Are you using VuhDo or Healbot in this clip? Your panel styles are designed differently than what I'm used to.
---
I'm a Frost Mage and Freezing Band dropped the other day. We didn't discuss BoE beforehand, but the group of random people were kind enough to pass it for me since it's BiS. If no one needs the item, I'd say all need on a chance of getting some free cash. If it's actually really good for someone, why would you also need the item. Wouldn't you be pissed if someone needed an item you actually want to equip, only for the to sell it on the AH?
---
Yes but if you undercut him you'll either have this cheapest price or he'll buy yours for a stupid price
---
Gotcha, thought you couldnt have horde and alliance on the same server.
---
Yep. I feel more people care that I'm a mage than they do about anything else. I mean I personally dont give a shit but itd be nice for someone to spark up an actual convo for once instead of either 1) demanding food and water or 2) sending me their copy paste of lfm dungeon spam in a whisper. Bitch you too lazy to type out to me imma have to decline.
---
Check the auction house for the current prices for an item. 
---
If there are no AH listings then you're free to make up any price. Look up the item and see if there's any secret use you don't know about, the item might be BiS for a twink or it might be good for future content. 
---
You can make up any price you want. Hop onto other servers and check their prices too if you want.
---
What is the hitcap for fury warriors (human using sword/maces)?
---
I read it is 8% normally but did weapon skill lower that?
---
Yeah but he was like super peaceful
---
The thorns part is right. But HoTs can't crit in Classic.
---
Dosent work like that in retail anymore. Your spec gives you your baseline not your class. 
---
Classic you choose what spells you wanna buff. Retail gives you actual abilities/passives to add to your arsenal.
---
You made me envious. I think high pop is the only appeal of PvP server. My old server was PvE with a pretty low population, my guild never even made it to the first blur dragon boss, and there was no other guild I knew able to go any further, and that was practically where my journey of WoW ended. If I were on a high pop server back in TBC, I may have the opportunity to join a guild for Sunwell and down Kil'jaedan.
---
To the 'which is it?' question I think the best answer is to communicate with your group. If everyone is happy to roll greed unless they need it then that's great. If people all want to roll need then go for it. 
---
If a few people aren't sure and it's looks like it might cause an issue in the group I'd rather everyone agree to roll need and move on so the dungeon group doesn't fall apart, but each to their own.
---
lol

Why spend enormous amounts of gold on an item that you could get from a drop? Not everyone has the cash to buy shit off the AH.

Saw a post that didn't credit these guys for a hilarious video earlier, but luckily someone in the comments pointed out the source.

I decided to check them out and while it isn't a very big channel in terms of content amount, it's full of absolute gold, but this one's my favorite.

I hate that a lot of people are like this. Just the other day i had a tank for a mythic waycrest on retail and it was obvious right away that he didnt know what he was doing so I tried my best to teach him what I could but he played on a Brazilian server and didnt speak english. I try to help the new guys as best I can because that's what i'd want if I was in their shoes. Its just a better mentality to have than just putting people down for being interested and just starting out in the game that youre also passionate about. 
---
EDIT: add onto that that this game is in desperate need for more people playing tanks. Retail and classic alike. No one should be shamed for trying to pick up a role that is thankless and terribly in need of players.
---
A simple flight path or  boat would be more than enough.
---
"we control the one town/flight path in this level 50 zone that has decent quests, vendors and profession farming."
---
In this case the low level farmer aiming low wins
---
Exactly correct, their attacks cause a large amount of threat, coupled with the odd growl - they hold threat no problem.
---
Their armour modifier is low but they have high damage. I really enjoy them for leveling.

I've been wearing the Spirit Hunter Headdress for this reason for like 10 levels. I haven't found anything better than it yet in terms of stats, but I'm going to be real sad when I finally have to drop it. It looks fantastic with the troll mohawk.

Congratulations on playing an MMO entirely on your own!
---
there was a rare fish to catch too, named old ironjaw
---
Yea but he may have irrevocably changed the price on the server. Whoever buys from him is gonna lose money if the change it to lower and anyone who puts a lower price get bought by him
---
Bgs are phase 3 (AV and WSG). In phase 2 only the honor system comes. Welcome the wpvp, baby.
---
I’ve done /who reports at several times of day with two accounts, one A and one H. People who are saying it’s 80-20 don’t know what they’re talking about. I generally counted 10 to 15 times as many level 60 characters in alliance capitols. I once counted more level 60 *druids* in Ironforge than the horde had level 60s in Orgrimmar of any class. 
---
Spend 10 minutes in Tanaris, Booty Bay, Blackrock, wherever, around prime time, and you’ll see ten alliance for every horde. Org is dead at 9pm while Ironforge is bustling. 
---
It’s a shame — the factions were even before the transfers. The situation will probably get worse as horde re-roll due to constant griefing. I’m actually quitting classic because I don’t have the time or energy to level to sixty a second time and I’m certainly not going to invest more time into this server
---
I have a second account I was using to scan both sides. Before they broke the add-on we determined out server was at 2 layers, then scanning at prime time with queue I was picking up 6500 horde, 5500 alliance give or take.
---
You can in PvE servers. You cant in PvP(only after cata you could)
---
Okay lmao. Enjoy your game that you can gear out in less than a month of lvl cap. And that’s it. 
---
Enjoy your 4 specs that people only wanna bring to raids otherwise you just get canned. Awyup good game
---
Classic WoW is, to me, about enjoying 99.9% of cases, but actively looking forward to the .1% of them.
---
They never go under 400 since server launch on my realm, ive been checking every day.
---
Cool thanks I was super worried that It was gonna mess everything up in the long run and it's a talent that I will get eventually just worried that I may have messed up getting it to early
---
Yup I'm using ardent custodian as a druid tank it cost me like 20g haha
---
I just see the funny shapes one guy posted a few days ago. Help me please
---
Hey can u add me to your giant black list too? Because id like to sell BoEs in my groups ty.
---
Yes your auto attacks are filler. You do damage from abilities and 5 combo stacks evis crits.
---
Those guys on discord arent as good as me either. 
---
I did mention the 20 AP. Insaid it's not that much
---
BUT it's running on linux, which is quite important for some people.
---
That area is not discoverable, it’s a plateau above the caves you can’t reach.

Asking to a warrior if he wanna share loots with someone else lul
---
Fuck, congrats!

The point is that a shared list loses all credibility the moment someone puts a target on for petty reasons. If you have your own list that's just a personal grudge and often leads to some pretty fun rivalry.

Feed your owl bro

I’m not sure I’m going to play without layering if I’m being honest. I only get to get on for a few hours a night and tonight I spent the entire time running back to my corpse because of gankers. Layers are gone so I can’t swap. Go to a different zone -&gt; it’s the same thing. It’s always at least one level 60 or a full group gank squad.

---
Noob question. What is a raid lockout? how do they work and how long do they last?
---
I'm only level 40. It does not need to speed up.
---
Not everyone is an engi try hard tho
---
I am but just saying
---
You are not lvl 56 and in full bis lol
---
PSA: WW axe is good when soloing. Ravager is good when doing aoe stuff, like cleaving dungeon farms. Warriors are going to want both regardless.
---
“You’re lucky you’re my brother too or I’d kill you”
---
Everyone complaining at the price. If it took him just 100hrs to get to 52 (probably way more) that’s $4 an hour. Seems fair to me.
---
This is me. The only draw back is your sleep schedule basically sucks, but it is nice to pull through STV or badlands and see 1, maybe 2 horde around lol.
---
Don't worry about it until level 40. Maybe then you should respect.
---
I always say, "one of us"
---
I said almost and i meant Pre BIS sryy haha
---
agreed!
---
A gold is a lot at your level, I recommend you wait. Keep going with whatever you're doing and consider switching to the drain tank spec way later on like lv 30 or 38
---
I play horde so I don’t have to care what my shoes look like.
---
Demon skin is caster only
---
No u.
---
Why would you respec to carry people through Deadmines? Are they paying for you to respec and then fix your talents after? If not, your friends are being massive asshats. That you would waste 30 minutes doing them such a favor for free, spending your own time and money on repairs, is already way more than anyone should be expecting. To ask for more is just insane.
---
This isn’t retail where a cap level player can pull the whole dungeon and instantly nuke it down. Carrying through even a low level dungeon is a time sink that the cap level player gets literally nothing for doing.
---
Entitled little shits should be happy :/
---
Those PvP are not pvpers
---
Nice one pal
---
Whatcha say about me typey boi?
---
Many people also play humans can gnomes are an eye sore
---
It was pretty rare to have a gaming pc that could run above 20-30 FPS in instances like AQ. Even in TBC when it was 25 man stuff a lot of people suffered from 10 FPS in raids.
---
Alright thanks but what's the drain tank spec the only class I have ever played is rogue so I'm really new to warlock.
---
Because sometimes you just don't want the responsibility or stress of tanking/healing and just want to deal damage.
---
Just because your class CAN do x or y doesn't mean you want to, other players shouldn't expect the same also
---
They get invited to dungeons but I admit that I didn't really think my reply through.
---
Horde side is dead, Alliance side is full and happy and will remain so into phase 2
---
Did the 60s show up???  I hate cliffhangers!
---
It isn't. The problem are the not the ninjas. The problem are people like you making it toxic in the name of "ninjas".....
---
That’s kind of mean..
---
Just plain toxic
---
But when you do /oom, the character says it in their voice (audio que). (also. can make some hotkey for it if you really want)
---
Meanwhile me as a tank can kill one mob in the same time :(
---
Guy probably rubbed one out to that lmao
---
The creator of this is a g
---
I used the bloodrobe til about mid thirties and don't feel gimped. The spell power is killer.
---
Checking the Auction House is the obvious and best option. If there isnt anything on the AH you can search for similar leveled items and then use the info to take an educated guess. All else fails you can usually ask for a price check in trade chat.
---
Amazing dude, great play!
---
Honestly just be glad warriors are even grouping with you and giving you the opportunity to roll on it. When trying to get corspemaker, Ravager and then lastly gatorbite I never took another warrior or shaman until I had them first. After that I would continue spam it to help others get gear until I reached my breaking point for spamming one instance.
---
In modern circles this is known as a "dick move".
---
Doesnt change the outcome.
---
About the same gold ammount i had at that level.
---
As soon as i got to a zone with thick leather and iron ores my earning potential spiked. Dinged 40 with 140g. Back to 200g now at level 46.
---
Great movie :P
---
since sunder is an attack skill, overpower will proc when the enemy dodges.

Good gear doesn't look good IMO. I don't like 90% of the tier sets, and chances are that tier set actually sucks for your character anyway. I DO like the sets like the Scarlet set, and there are a low of good lower level cloth and leather items.
---
You can't make it so it drags against the grid automatically just gotta be precise with your mouse i supose.
---
You can set it to look like raid in your party famers options.
---
Remove the portrait and power bar. Remove pets and so on.
---
Make them the size that you want. At least thats what I did.
---
Well, yeah, rogues have it a bit better. Not too much better though, like mages and ofc locks/hunters
---
To each their own but I really do not understand how people can enjoy aoe/dungeon farming from 17-50 like that. To me that's like skipping the game, one step removed from having someone else level your character for you.
---
Lok tar ogar
---
If you're 40 a month in you'll already have done plenty of MC raids in four months time.
---
Alright, that was next level
---
Lol, on Grobbulus that shit sells for 1g PER Wildvine lmao

No lifers or raid dungeon spammer
---
It's ok -- so in retail wow you can only get loot from a boss one time ("loot-locked") but can run the boss as many times as you want. 
---
In Classic this isn't the case -- you can only run one raid of each Molten Core and Onyxia per raid lockout... For Molten Core, that's once every 7 days. For Onyxia, it's once every 5 days. 
---
Think of it as a dungeon instance that doesn't reset until the # days have expired. 
---
At some point in WoW development, when you zoned into someone else's raid, it would give you a disclaimer asking if you wanted to save/lock yourself to that specific instance. 
---
In Classic Wow this is not the case (and probably wasn't for vanilla). What this means is if you zone into someone's raid, you will be locked to that specific instance for the remainder of the lockout.
---
Its kind of amazing that the classic wow community is so large and active ATM!
---
Can someone explain why he would pay that much for the staff. Is a level 43 item BiS at level 60 or something?
---
Maybe you shouldn't be carrying such ungrateful lil brats
---
What he’s doing is actually how a lot of the gold capped goblins make money. They take control of the market and crank prices. Once they can afford to control it they set the prices and offload their stock at huge markups.
---
Only problem is that you need stock with a high demand and a slow enough production rate that you can crank the price, limit or buyout competition, and corner the market on an item that people need to buy.
---
I’m not sure this guy picked a great commodity to do that with, as this herb isn’t exactly high level or hard to farm, and I’m not sure people are tripping all over themselves to get it, either :l
---
Until you catch rabies in Duskwood...
---
maybe that's why he leads pugs
---
I think they gave it to a level 25ish druid for later :p.
---
Nothing, steal their mining node.
---
Thanks, mate!
---
Won't that still be true in phase 2?
---
Heals can’t miss, make sure you have the right target selected and aren’t using a bad macro or the self cast key. 
---
If someone leaves your range or line of sight the heal may not complete but that isn’t a miss
---
what class is he playing? seems like only palys get sulfuras on alliance side
---
Sounds like more magetard
---
2s, and i have 50 bag spots left so thanks. Or maybe I'll use it if im in a hurry and don't want to use my expensive ass shop food.
---
im not happy but whatever
---
How much better is 1H+Shield though? With the talent it's 10% chance to block, and blocking doesn't even completely mitigate incoming damage.
---
I think the problem with 2H tanks isn't the lack of shield, it's the itemization. They'll gladly wear cloth if it only gives them bit extra DPS. So they have no armor. So they take a shitload of damage.
---
Hey, whats that addon on the side under your map? :)
---
Thanks
---
Mages do outdps locks first 5 phases by A LOT, where they after phase 5 only out dps locks by a little bit :)
---
Better damage and more mana for off heals.
---
We found out with my guild that /pray-ing 4 times will get u the item 90% of the time. Guildy got like 4 preraid bis items in a row like that.
---
Hating mages is obviously hating the player. /s
---
OP is obviously sensitive. /s off
---
Thanks, mate! I magined him liking cutting a bit too much and not only on others.
---
A necessary sacrifice
---
So am I. Even if you can layer hop instantly, if there's only 2-3 layers you're going to be continually returning to already farmed layers.
---
there are always people popolating all ranks,
---
there will be imidiatly rank 14 players at week one.
---
the ranks are always split by population, for example the top 1% are rank 14, the next 2% are rank 13 and so on
---
If even 4-5 days later.. if I was in a major guild I wouldn't give a shit about any of that. Am I supposed to keep a list of people on my computer and cross reference that with every ally I pass by? Unless they have a very memorable name there's no way. And even if it was someone with a recognizable name unless they were did something completely reprehensible I wouldn't care.
---
Thanks man! Gonna tame one.
---
Now that would be funny. Every time a warlock sees someone they buff THEMSELVES with demon skin and then keep on going, thinking to themselves how generous they are. LOL
---
It would take some dedication to not look when it's very tempting to. Goodluck!
---
The WoW economy is actually kinda nuts. 4g is three months wages based upon costs of food. You could buy ~285 level 5 meals with that much money, assuming one meal is a drink and a food item. At 3 meals a day, that 4g will last you 95 days.
---
For further reference, and just fun, the 100g cost for riding and a mount would get you ~8,333 meals, which would set you up for almost 8 years. Having the 1k gold for an epic mount is the equivalent of being a millionaire.
---
Few of us were stuck on a dead realm (Judgement EU) and the only choice we had was to transfer to the Spanish Mandokir realm, so we did, fk it, and we're enjoying the game again on a very active server with no queues either and picking up a bit of Spanish along the way plus a very active and decent Auction House.
---
It's pretty fast preferred phase 2 end q1 of 2020. I'm in a guild with 800 none has hit 60 atm. Thought classic was for relaxing leveling (currently lvl 30)  more things to do on a day then 10 years ago. If phase 2 comes in Dec lot of use prob never seen a raid from phase 1..
---
The secret is leveling at multiple zones simultaneously using yellow and sometime green quests. You can kill quest mobs faster and while someone wastes half of hour camping quest mob you can complete several quests.
---
Thank you! I'm happy it's relatable to fellow players.
---
You can also have a resto shaman assigned to mostly totem work using it. No need to waste the slot on a subpar dps when you can fit in a support to do healing and get all the same benefits.
---

---
Wut
---
what does that macro look like?
---
can you send me the details?
---
you say that like that's not what I said
---
Hello fellow ResetEra-er.
---
I find it ironic you hate this much on "neckbeards" when the whole reason classic is even a thing is due to that type of wanting a more time investment required experience.
---
this is my favorite character in all of wow, i wish he was in heroes of the storm
---
Haha, thank you! I got swamped by work quite a bit and this one was delayed. But we keep traveling!
---
Depending on your server, "world" and "lfg" channels are also used heavily alongside "lookingforgroup".
---
I have a macro which switches between battle and defensive stances and also switches between my 2h and sword + 1h.  It's not always what you want to do but most of the time it seems to work out fine.
---
Also, have you specced into improved demo shout?  Will help with threat.  If you want to aggro a pack before the mages go crazy, you can try:
---
&lt;battle&gt; charge, clap, bloodrage, demo &lt;defensive&gt; revenge, tab sunder everything once, another demo shout, more tab sunders.
---
If you are over levelled / geared for the pack then try, charge, bloodrage, sweeping strikes, zerker stance, WW, demo, MS, Cleave, WW again, burn them down.
---
Any warriors with alternative rotations / improvements / other ideas lets hear em!
---
My only gripe with mages, as a mage, is when another mage in my party throws out flamestrike, blizzard, or coc before the pull is ever complete. Feels like so many mages are so competitive with meter dps they screw up each pull to *prove something*. Funny watch them die each time
---
Here's a thought, it's not retail and whatever other bullshit has automatic queues and assigned roles. You don't join a group as a dps, you join a group to do a certain dungeon. No one really gives a fuck what you want to cosplay as, people just want to clear the damn thing and move on with their lives. Same as you. I'll ask (and have, successfully) a hunter's pet to tank if it gets the job done. Can you imagine a hunter throwing a fit when being asked to turn growl on saying he signed as a DPS? How stupid would that sound? Well, it's even stupider with warriors. You're playing a class that has every tool at their disposal to clear that dungeon and you're refusing to use those tools it because you want to play a role. How is that not being a snowflake?
---
Jfc this is awesome

I'm more concerned about getting destroyed in PvP as a casual player. I won't be raiding (no time) but I love PvP and Bg's, so i hope i still have a chance with my (hopefully one day) blue set from scholo/strat..

Back when? The hotfix the previous poster is referring to went out after September 6th. See: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/layer-switching-is-the-problem-not-layering-itself/286941/20

the top 0.1% is rank 14

so if there are 1000 ranked people, the best one is rank 14

"I will avenge you, my fallen friends! But first I need to find another group..."
---
You work off a cost-basis to begin with and depending on what the difference between demand and supply is thats your margin. 
---
Its all voodoo and gut feel really but you can try and find comparable situations, like for BoEs or other crafted gear to get a rough idea.
---
Fear juggling like this is awesome. Read that tip on this sub a couple weeks ago. Game changer.

I don't believe it is a Fad and yes they have dedicated servers. I am in TAS and get 25ms
---
I am talking about the launch week
---
Respek!
---
Holy shit you're completely delusional.
---
I agree. I don't know if it's intended but the common guides I read say otherwise. There's no animation but you can clearly the white you deal
---
Well then they have to accept that they won't get invited to groups, and they can't bitch about it on reddit when people don't want a warrior dps.
---
That stealth click kills me
---
Well, I do believe that the pvp gear will hit eventually, so you'll be able to farm that up with honor--but for all I know that'll be phase 5 or 6. I remember that it happened late, just before TBC hit...
---
How? It's the only fair way to conduct looting.
---
Everyone deserves the same shot at the item that's worth the same to everyone.
---
The winner then earns the right to do what they want with it. They can have the group reroll because blokes like you opted out of the roll, they can give it to someone who needs it, sell it for themselves, sell it and split the money to the party members, store it in the bank, give it to an alt etc. etc.
---
Describe the problem?
---
I'd have to do some digging on when it actually adds it, a quick search seems to point to after the hit.
---
Not sure what happens if you cancel it though.
---
I mean, that'd make me rich right now....
---
&gt; Not setting foot into ubrs or MC is simply a lack of motivation on your part. Others that are more motivated have already been doing it.
---
Good for them, they are the tiny minority though. In the LFG channel right now on my server there are basically zero people opening/looking for UBRS groups. Just yesterday I had somebody in my LBRS group who was willing to give each person in the party 10 gold just so they don't roll need on the last gem he needed for the UBRS key.
---
That too, who will be fighting for rank 14? Because only a certain amount of people can get it:0

Just confirmed by two streamers, today, that it's still on u retard hahahahahaha

keep trying scrub, you'll post something useful some day!

It's from a movie. Geez.
---
You mean literally the most recognizable character in WoW after W3 majors?
---
I think we're thinking about it differently. I'm thinking of it as a character to character interaction (like RP) and you're thinking of it as a player to player interaction. If I was a Nelf and saw a fellow Alli member in trouble, I would, in character, defend my bro and spit on the corpse of my enemy. It depends on the context. Did he spit because he wants the player to feel bads or is it for his immersive satisfaction? No way to tell.
---
Yeah GY is totally skippable. The only reason I ever run it is to get the off hand to pair with the healing mace from Cath.
---
yeah and its 100% fair, but for some reason people seem to think that the need/greed titles are ment to be taken literally.
---
need/greed is for BOPs, boes are primarly for money so everyone needs on em too prevent theft. but some dont see that
---
imo if its over 100g its fair game. thats alot of money
---
Purely optimal, no rewards besides satisfaction. Not even honorable kills are counted. 
---
In phase 2 the gear rewards are in but no BGs to farm honor.
---
I think Nat is referring to playing MMORPG in grand perspective. We are all fanatical fishers in a way.
---
I bought mine for 50g, the guy selling it tried 4 times on AH for 100g. (I'm on a full server that had multiple rings on AH)
---
I have no intention of putting this specific GM on blast, which is why I removed their name. I'm sure GMs process way too many cases every day and have very little time to make decisions, that is not their fault. Judging by the number of similar reports on reddit right now, the problem is clearly not with GMs themselves but with how their system flags and deals with these situations.
---
P.s. Don't take pay cuts.
---
don't know why you cant find a group. you literally have the ability to fill any role
---
the dps isn't amazing, but I still pulled about the same dps as hunters and warriors.  you won't beat a rogue or mage, but you bring much more utility (FF, innervate, brez)
---
feral tanks are pretty much the best 5man tank, and druid healers are just as good as every other healer, minus a normal rez.
---
i have had literally zero issue finding groups.
---
Same thing happened to me, you're not on Arugal on Alliance right?
---
Honestly this has been my issue with druids/paladins/hunters, in that order. 
---
- can I need this for my tank set?
---
- can I need this for my heal set?
---
- I'm respec'ing soon can I roll on this for dps?
---
- I'm rolling this for solo questing
---
- it might have spell power but it also has 9 heal power I'm taking this btw
---
- guys can I need this boe for my friend/girlfriend/alt?
---
..
---
Its never ending.
---
Ours does the same thing.
---
Think the point is to use voice chat.
---
Doing dungeons is the best thing to do. Not saying is faster or anything but do you have any idea how much gold you can make at 60 if you saved all the plaguelands quests and the xp is converted in to gold?
---
Ah right makes sense, thank you. Do you know how it's calculated at your level?
---
I'll just play pvp with some pve for gearing up.
---
Literally didn't complete a single step. I accepted it and abandoned it shortly after to make room.
---
The extended stat page
---
Hey if you like being used go ahead, I just thought you'd like to know
---
if a boe drops and you need and they greed. thats them being stupid
---
you always roll need to prevent ninja'ing.
---
if they all roll greed vs your need, you can reroll the item. or if its a big enough item you keep it. because they clearly need to learn the lesson the hard way.
---
let the market games begin
---
If you're using the swing timer addon and not the correct one it doesn't account for the latency
---
No condescension. 
---
Play solo. Get ganked. Bitch about how you can't level up.
---
IT'S AN MMO. 
---
Make friends or get farmed.
---
Yup.
---
Used to be that fishing had a couple of items that could go for a good amount of gold. On my server fish that went for 1g+ in vanilla are currently selling for less than 15 silver a pop. Lots of markets are super over saturated right now. It may be that they’ll eventually level out once more people are raiding and fewer are out in the world farming and leveling as much, but who’s to say?
---
Best you can do is scan your server’s ah for stuff that’s still got a good price and target that.
---
Okay cool thanks for the help
---
I forgot the Barrens had grass like that. At first I thought you were just one brave motherfucker over in Westfall.
---
/r/titlegore
---
Era of entitlement and instant gratification. We are no longer viewed as people, just make believe tools used so others can benefit from us. Narcissism is rampant, even if it's just pretend behavior.
---
I mean seems a little over the top, but why waste your time and their time pvping in the first place. I see so many asshole players grief each other, what happened to the golden rule...
---
Never gonna happen, epic pvp gear will be locked to pvp title. What you are referring to is TBC prepatch which will never be include in classic, that would be a TBC server.
---
You can't get 14 ranks in one week.
---
I really don't understand why they can't just release bgs with the honor system. Main part of why I ever played wow, was for pvp. I have very little interest in raiding. I mean I am only lvl 35 now, and it will take me probaly until the end of the year to hit 60, but I really am not sure if I want to keep playing, if they don't release bgs soon
---
That's why you always buy an herb you will find useful in bulk and that is necessary to level. For me, it was khadgar's whisker- bought all of it, relisted for 20% more than I bought it for, bought out all undercutters, made a tidy profit and saved some to level. 
---
if I was richer, I'd have done it with sunglass or blindweed, and bought all the cheap superior mana potions at the same time to raise all prices
---
If they guy doing this does it right he will just grab all the lower priced entries as they appear and his will continue to sell at the much higher price, this requires the person doing this to have a decent stack of change to fund the start up phase.
---
That's not how it works.
---
The maximum amount your rank can move up is capped very strictly, even if you are the \#1 CP rank every week it will be 3 straight months of that to hit R14.
---
Keep opening tickets and hope you get a different GM. Remember they're short staffed and not everyone will have the same amount of training. Or check to see what happens if you go to the trainer in org and just talk to them.
---
Especially considering Teldrassil is present, so it ain't like this is a few hundred years old or anything either. I don't play retail anymore, I wonder what it looks like now?
---
you can still calculate an expected time of getting it
---
&gt;it was recognizing they could bypass the week long mc lock outs, and abusing that. 
---
Yes. Abusing the layering. Really don't get what you're trying to argue.
---
It is just one of many avenues the game gives you to level. I simply had fun grinding the dungeons. Pulling big gave me a thrill. I also like healing and it gave my many opportunities to do just that.
---
fucking hell, i want do this now all day long :O why nobody told me i can help cows with buffs :O
---
I'm convinced. 
---
I'll join
---
Yep, just waiting for this kinda shit to start happening on my server.
---
I appreciate that there were a whole bunch of people trying to be good and help out by putting up materials at vendor prices, or even sometimes less than vendor prices, but that kinda nonsense can't last forever. All it takes is one good goblin who has enough to buy up the entire server's stock of an item, and they can set a new, higher price through a simple sniper operation.
---
Exactly. This guy is throwing his weight here WAY too early in the cycle.
---
Seems like he got an AH add-on, saw it was "undervalued" and did this without knowing what he was doing.
---
Unyielding Maul is actually better than Warden Staff in p2, since you can put an Iron Counterweight for the 3% increased attack speed to the mace and there are no effective weapon enchants for the staff
---
No, because money
---
I mean... if you're into that...
---
No.
---
come transfer to Earthshaker, 1 layer realm, tons of people from LH, 2 guilds from Lightbringer are here also, server is 50-50 balance and it absolutely donged the other 3 transfer realms in traffic
---
Here comes the discussion if ninjas were a intentional part of the design(be it planned from the start or incorporated later on when they found this interaction) or just a flaw in the Need/Greed system. But in the end yeah the existence of ninjas makes you care more about your own rep on the server, if trust was not needed why bother building it.
---
Imho for product like Kingsblood this is not profitable. You only make other people profit. Bigger profit will atract ppl who can collect kingsblood or have some stacks in bank. Now these new sellers will undercut Original seller so original guy has to either buy overpriced or he never sells his. Now common sellers will usually undercut themselves pretty often so price will drop. Ofc some ppl will profit - if you manage to sell your stuff for 175% of original price, that's sweet. But this is not worth. 
---
For this action to work you need limited supply. For example rare recipe for high demand item/consumable/enchant.
---
Ahhhhhh, the good ol "Fear yoyo".

What's that cat doing?
---
So you sincerely believe that because you chose to play "x" spec in the character create screen, I owe it to you to pass on 500-1000 gold and let you take it? Feel free to put me on ignore, I'd rather not play with you.  
---
Schreien-Noggenfogger.
---
&gt;	Yes.. we knew this from day 1 when Blizzard told us they planned to down-port the game to a shard-designed client.
---
Server, client is not relevant.  
---
But it makes sense, the old server could have been used but it sos fill of known exploits and other vulnerabilities that it just wouldn't be a good idea, and they would have had to spend a lot of development time to fix all those issues that are already fixed, again.
---
They probably could just scale up their server instances used for classic. Whether it's a VM or baremetal server doesn't really affect performance. But I am willing to bet that they're only allocating resources for the bare minimum to keep the servers running.
---
So tldr, current server infrastructure is fine. They just need to scale up resources for them, just as if it was a physical server.
---
Using his post history as a source of your argument makes no better than him, just saying.

tbf, the armor loss as it increases almost never gets close to evening out the ap gain. Not to say you should be using max rank, but you can usually afford to use a little more than rank one. I usually go with two ranks below the highest rank CoR that I have.
---
His mechanics basically guarantee that anyone dies quick regardless of level if you don't do it properly, right? You can't just do what we did and run level 80 BWL for funs.
---
edit: nvm wiki says "As of Patch 5.1, it is now possible to solo C'Thun. ". Jesus power creep.

It's simple.
---
You are a kid and cant use your empathic part of the brain untill well into your 20s. So you can only see issues from your own point of view. 
---
And if you are a adult, well you probably smoked too much weed in your teens leading to a mental underdevelopment.
---
As said by others- always state the exact terms in chat with the other player. I know it sounds stupid, but if I say "making bags with your mats"- that doesn't mean I'm making bags FOR YOU with your mats. Only deal with players that state specific terms- anyone legit should have no problem with that, and even welcome it.
---
The response you got means they could not verify the exact terms, so you are out of luck. However, GM's hate scammers with a passion, so they might be taking a look at that player to see if they can find something actionable. Scammers don't just do it once, most likely there will be other reports.
---
Last thing- all you need to provide is the players name and an approximate time it happened in your description. No need for a screenshot- in fact a SS is not considered proof. Everything a GM needs is in the logs, and only the logs can be used to take action. Blizzard will never tell you about action taken on another player, that's been policy for as long as I can remember.
---
Don't beat yourself up over this- it wasn't a big loss and anyone can  get scammed.  It's okay to trust- just be sure to verify.
---
Who the hello would call them self IpswichTown lmfao
---
I dont think most mages are bad, there are just so many it appears that way. I see a lot of mage hate on this sub, but at the same time groups always have 1 or 2.
---
Being on a KoS list for a guy like this is meaningless anyway.  Any player of the opposite faction, so long as he has a huge advantage, is KoS.  Being on a list doesn't change anything.

What was the oops? Did he mean to tell some other group of people he needed to get off and eat?

They killed the Furlbrows!?
---
That's it, farming Defias

Absolutely! That fits!
---
Instead of making fun of him. You should be happy for him that he had the awareness to show humility.
---
Oh, personal attacks. The classic behaviour from a successful man with a "big house" and a "good job" and an "actual successful life". I thought the game was 2 truths and 1 lie, not 3 lies.
---
I doubt that the phase release schedules will be equally spread out. Phase 2 has arguably the least amount of content for players to chew on, especially once a significant % of players reach 60. I would expect phase 2 will be the shortest of all the phases, imo.
---
XPtoLevel I believe.

I was in a group that had Robes of Insight drop in ZF this morning!

A second raid group makes no sense. It wont happen. If you are good geared as you cisim, and a decent tank just find another guild.
---
My guild does the same thing, which makes me think its not totally original
---
dinno we have same 1 gold per one. Its a rare herb, why would it be 1 gold per stack...lol
---
Surprise LPT
---
He was probably thinking of Astranaar, man that would have been painful
---
I think phase 2 is being released to fast. I don't know how many people are max but doubt it's a large percentage. 
---
If I was bliz I'd wait until at least 50% of classic accounts have one max level or players will feel under pressure or missing out.
---
That's actually a really good point, I couldn't quite date the map but with Teldrassil that points to it being after the Third War. That means it's also missing the islands of Kul'Tiras. The biggest difference from retail is the lack of Pandaria, but that's not exactly surprising.
---
Constantly remodelling my UI, I am quite happy with [this](https://i.postimg.cc/jtgHLvnq/ASd.jpg) so far. I have tried your Grid-profile on Onyxia, Molten Core, UBRS, Strat UD, Scholo and... one BRD run. Found that spotting debuffs would be a lot easier if it worked like my party frames (Shadowed Unit Frame). Which besides the tiny icon underneath also colours the health purple when a player has a debuff. Because there are so many icons in that tiny square something that catches your eye a bit more would be an improvement.
---
I heard that dudes dad also is a trained navy seal man.
---
Gotcha. What makes it rough and what happens at 30 that makes it better?
---
Since you explained this so well, could you comment on what I've been doing? I'm casual and don't dungeon often, but when I do, I usually just pass on everything unless I have a specific need for it, though not necessarily main related. For example, if it would be a decent weapon for an alt as long as it's not stepping on some other person's class in the group.
---
Is this a weird practice? It seemed to make sense to me, but I dont know.
---
How is this not low effort content?
---
Warrior here - don’t be a fucking DPS pussy and tank.
---
I'm in the same boat, lvl 33 pally and continuously get stuffed out in the world.
---
That is their problem. You can tell them they can roll for tank gear and nothing else.
---
Stop being a yes-man for tanks.
---
Also if you set your thresholds right you can convince these people to buy half your stockpile above fair market value.
---
You post the correct amount that they don't think twice about buying it. They spin that mousewheel.
---
When they do you post more. They spin that mousewheel.
---
You repeat this until they catch on, send you an angry whisper and act like your Robin Hood shenanigans are more dastardly than the shit they're trying to pull. Then you give them shit for not paying attention while they spin their mousewheel. You finish with some disgusting aphorism like "don't hate the player..."
---
Most of the playerbase aren't lvl 60 yet. This isn't retail as Blizzard can take their time. The majority should enjoy the ride because they provide the cash. If the rush crowd starts to get bored I believe thats not something they really care about. It's an old game, noone really bats an eye what they are achieve.
---
The thing is how long can he stand buying all stock? If price is high more ppl will farm it for easy profit. And weekend is comming so ppl will have more time to farm. And if you put it for price just a bit lower he will not profit as he has to pay auction fees. Its a good strategy but used on wrong product
---
Zug zug
---
I'm confused...
---
if you enter a raid at all, once you leave you're locked out?
---
if not, why wouldn't your guild just go to your instance? all they would miss is the trash, and they still get to raid with a guildmate
---
No it is not... If people want to use you denie them the chance to roll need and use it themself.
---
I did it. We found a decent epic shield Wall of death worth 100gold ish.
---
I rolled need and equipped it and tanked with the other guys for the rest of day.
---
Your attitude is greed. Nothing else. You want money Mc Duck.
---
I had more problems with all need people then with ninja looter...i had zero ninjas
---
Only a place like silithus should take more time to get to by then for any alliance member, it's not difficult, it's just a bitch to get there
---
"I liked my own post, therefore I win"
---
Ok then.
---
Do you? Depends on how many on the AH, how long you wait. How is it always guaranteed the same price? I am not seeing how from what your saying?
---
For some reason I don't think it is hardware issue (poor servers). Servers are cheap today. I don't see reason they would actually save with server capacity.
---
My best guess is that because Classic uses same code base (and engine) what modern WoW uses, we have these problems. With modern WoW they have solved these problems with sharding. So they never have needed optimization for situations when there is huge amount of players at same area. With Classic thing is different  and we start to more clearly see that modern engine of WoW is not meant for hundreds of players.
---
These thoughts are based on what I have experienced on my career in software industry. Sometimes no matter how much you increase server resources, problems still do exists because actual code just is poorly optimized. And then we are in situation where software uses absurd amount of resources but still performs poorly because code has poor optimization. Current technology is far better that what it has been but we are not in situation where software (like WoW server side) could be done with idea "hey as long as it works". It does need thought put into it.
---
I just think no matter how much they would invest into hardware, we are not going to see difference until they really put time and effort and optimize their server code so it can handle these large scale PvP fights.
---
Very neat.. 
---
Although, as previously stated by others, relying on anything but  /roll, will make it possible to cheat, because this would have to be run from someones macro, that only the player can see.
---
You could remove some of the less desired possible values, or just change to math.random to only give the higher end of the values.
---
/roll prints the possible values, without you being able to interfere with it.
---

PvP does not equal arena player I guess

Leaving a comment to save this later!
---
Does cutting edge raiding really matter in classic? I get raiders want to move on but pushing to fast will leave a drought at end game I feel blizzard need to pace themselves unless they have something lined up ready to go. It's not like they haven't done this before and seen the result.
---
they doing it wrong then
---
I sold my account in actually vanilla for a lot more than $400. Months later I got sick of getting emails from blizzard because the dumbass never changed the account email. I just responded to one of them that I sold the account and to please stop emailing me, got a response saying it was locked and call if I'd like it back.... It might not happen now, but the threat of it happening at some point will always be there.
---
There are no new raids in phase 2, and it's not like they're deleting Molten Core when BWL comes out in Phase 3. Take your time, you don't need to do content as it comes out.
---
im worried that some people from guild will leave after they saw this :( leave wow i mean *  Too long for a phase..
---
Classic isnt hard, why would you think more classic would be hard?
---
You should report that behaviour.
---
Or because they can’t down rank their spells?
---
Obviously 2h tank isn’t gonna work too well when you’re brd+
---
Not hard yet.
---
Sometimes when i loot a mob, the loot box opens but it's empty. when i close the loot box, the sparkly effect on the mob indicating its lootable disappears. Is this normal?
---
In my experience.. all alliance kill on sight regardless.
---
Good for you
---
seriosuly i lucked the hell out finding this out as a hunter main. seeing all these fury warriors being fake rogues and warlocks in + shadow dmg gear, meanwhile hunters are styling in full tier gear!
---
Floor inspector on duty!
---
To be fair it could be very differently on different servers, but ye /lfg on my server is 95% end-game dungeons.
---
That is the only qol thing that is missing. Both for adding guildraids, events and such, but also see holidays, resets, Darkmoon and so on :(
---
Here's how this is going down at BlizzCon:
---
"Hey guys, so ... wow ... you REALLY like Classic, eh? We're amazed by your committment and because you're so awesome we're gonna give you Phase TWO... TOMORROW ,bam" - and everyone loves blizzard.
---
Why would more easy bosses be hard? Nothing is hard about aq or naxx. The hard parts were the resistances and class stacking. 
---
Resist doesn’t matter when you don’t get hit by mechanics and class stacking doesn’t matter when you already have too many warriors.
---
We already seen how fast they have done it on private servers.
---
As a rogue I always take the chests and ask if anyone needs anything from what I looted. If something particularly valuable dropped then I will roll it off.
---
In my opinion the chest should go to the person who can open it just like mining nodes or skins, but most people seem to disagree with that so this is a fine compromise.
---
Yes theres no reason to play alliance. 
---
Im just happy some people do, so i have someone to gank when im bored with grinding.
---
Whats wrong with asking ''you mind tanking?' '
---
You can simply say no, but I agree with other cases
---
For the few fights you need a second guy in tanking gear, sure. But 31/5/15 does competitive dps using a real weapon and more than prot warrior in a raid is mostly a waste
---
Came to the comments for the song/artist, but now I know to hate them! Fuck sabaton!
---
This is the best
---
No not really.
---
I went gnomish to get all of the BoP items and then rerolled goblin for sappers and the mortar.
---
Big brain play right here.
---
Take it from someone who played a class they didn't enjoy for *years* because it became stuck as their "main." It is definitely *not* a waste of time to start fresh on a new character you love. No, the only waste of time is every minute you continue to play the one that you don't.
---
I tanked Cath with my eye of killrog, come at me.
---
This picture is dumb but so is everyone here saying a 52 rogue can't beat a 60.
---
Have to get the full vanilla experience.
---
I don't see what the big deal is, it was just Ricardo
---
Funny how you are the one who benefitted from that, while I encourage a more fair option, and you call me greedy.
---
I'm not sure if you're serious, a troll, or just simply unaware
---
I was initially using twig of the world tree for raw strength and bonus to human racial but I upgraded to the Obsidian Edge Blade Two days ago.
---
Difference between a skilled set of players and randoms.
---
Best time to pick up tanking is at the beginning of an expansion or with a group of four friends who can walk you through each dungeon and the pulls. 
---
Any time a guildie said they wanted to tank I would tell them to wait til the next expansion.
---
However, you never know a dungeon until you tank the dungeon. DPS usually know kill order, but they barely have an understanding of NOC abilities unless they can die from it. Healers usually know abilities that deal large incoming damage.
---
A tank needs to know all of that, plus tank debuffs, positioning, aggro for each mob, call out dps that are targeting wrong priority, picking up adds, abilities of each mob, etc.
---
You never know a dungeon until you tank that dungeon in a non-overgeared PUG. In fact, I love PUGGing as a Tank.
---
I think there's diminishing returns similar to overleveling. Like attacking higher level mob (red) will net you less exp, similar to attacking green mob would only get you like 50-75% (numbers pulled from my ass, just and estimate )base exp.
---
Run in to the middle of the fray and start crafting ruined leather to light leather. Just make sure you have enough mats to last the whole battle.
---
Shit like this scares me. I am in Europe, I play on us servers, and I intend to still be playing when I eventually go back to the us. Scary.
---
Good luck with your account, op
---
Bruh, in Vanilla Bloodrazor dropped for my Warlock. 
---
Guess who used it.
---
Everyone will be antsy for BGs 2 weeks after phase 2. You'll have neck beards camping outside every popular quest hub ready to farm you for honor.
---
Someone tested it at 60 and you get more hp from crusader than lifestealing
---
4g is a good price i guess, droprate is not so good, i farmed it for like slightly over an hour.
---
As a Rogue, the only way I really know to be helpful is pulling mobs off someone who looks like they're struggling.
---
If I can save someone a repair bill and a corpse run, that makes the whole interaction worthwhile. Sometimes it doesn't work out and we both die anyway, but i hope they appreciate the effort
---
while I wouldn’t agree with enforcing it, you are correct that it forms a solid foundation for guilds.
---
My current guild has been awesome to hang out with and chat even outside of WoW. Really makes you appreciate the players behind the screen that bit more! 
---
I also am playing with a group of rl friends that are new at the game and the discord has helped them learn the game at a faster pace then I can teach them. One of my buddies has even outleveled me to 60 (Im 44) and is working on getting rep recipes to craft with help from guildies.
---
All of this has made the game much more enjoyable.
---
If a guild is capable to efficiently farm MC/Ony now then it will be ready to efficiently do AQ and Naxx. The only problem for them will be keeping \~40 people playing for 2 years+. Smaller guilds and alike will have to PUG and may skip or struggle with some AQ bosses, while in Naxx without good raid leading you can't do much, maybe farm frozen runes and a bit of trash. Those guild will have to merge, there will be drama and no everyone will end up doing Naxx.
---
No time wasted, I'm thinking of doing the opposite to you, sorts of, I main a lvl 40 druid, but thinking about going and rolling a warlock for an alt.
---
Druid is much fun and fits any situation, I mean you open as a rogue, weather big hits like a warrior and harass from a distance like a caster, even better you get healing toolkit too.
---
just remember not to stick with one style in druid, if you stick to just bear, or just cat, or just balance or just resto. You will find the class much weaker in each area than any of the other classes. Even off spec the other toolkits don't lose much potency, so use them all.
---
No I do not since it's a random world chest. Anyone can take it, just because you kill some mobs around it doesn't automatically mean it's yours.
---
There is one in the desolate that gives you 3g it’s along the coast you find keys for a chest and it’s super easy.
---
"stigma" lol.
---
My stigmatism kept me from reading what I spelled.  👀

In openfield hunter is indeed the superior kiter, but any LoS and shaman can now take advantage  to heal, cleanse, hide some nice totems so hunter doesn't snipe them  ...etc
---
Also care about LoS, since pet will eagerly follow, and shaman can kill it without receiving much damage back from the ranged hunter due to LoS.
---
Bis for feral tank, there is no better item in the game
---
Question for priests. At what point is it worth swapping out of shadow and going Holy? I would assume BRD and above aren’t the most feasible healing as shadow, right?
---
After endless hours playing this game, I tgink you're right it'd be nice to have a reason to have some downtime lol
---
Can also use Divine Intervention.
---
That's hilariously stupid that they would do that for a print. Glad it didn't end up being super noticeable or anything given the content in your case - but I'm imagining them doing that with a family picture and the family deciding to hang it up anyway - wide ass family pic
---
Well the original plague was the ones used in Stratholme. She masterminded the use at wrathgate (we assume) but put the full blame on Putriss and then went and used it on the worgen. Her story has been going downhill since then
---
City raids = dishonorable kills.
---
Serious pvpers going for ranks won’t do city raids

The problem is that WoW in 2005 was constantly getting new people by word of mouth, advertisements, etc. There was always a fresh flow of new players for several years.
---
Classic WoW will not have that and will have a population wave that you have to ride to avoid those issues. People who wanted to play classic were not going to wait a month or two to start playing. There won't be organic word of mouth and a flow of new players. I don't think this is at all unexpected.
---
Started one soon after posting this.  Lvl 11 and so far it's fun.   :)
---
The thing is you can list your stuff in a way that reseller always lose if he mantains set price. For example if this kingsblood has auction fees 10s for 8hours (dunno exactly) you can put it for 1g31s or more and he either
---
 a) buys yours and doesnt profit from resell
---
b) buys yours and list it so he profits (and you place your next stack higher accordingly)
---
c) doesnt buy yours which means noone will buy his stuff.
---
If you have enough cash like few thousand gold you can take control of the market but is it really worth it?
---
List your addons PLZ!
---
Yo I’m bout to go to the board for ocs acceptance very soon (army)
---
Any tips?
---
Hunter can dual wield.
---
Extra points if it was the tank or healer
---
Really nice UI.

Probably just a lot more spread out now, so you don't have to render all of them in one place
---
2020 in phase 3
---
phase 2 is coming at the end of 2019, so phase 3 will be like march or so
---
The simple answer is because thats how it was back then. Honor system came before BGs
---
There’s a real missed opportunity here for employers. People who can successfully run a serious raiding guild for years have some serious people, management, logistics, and organization skills.
---
If I was hiring I’d look for this on resumes, yet there’s a damn stigma on video games. Probably have a better chance putting multiple DUIs on your resume and getting the job. It’s more socially acceptable to be a drunk than an adult gamer.
---
Pretty much everything stated here already get gnomish to like 235/245 get all the tinkers from gnomish that you want. Then you drop it and level goblin and get all the grenades
---
Yeah it´s arbitrary. I just threw it out so we talk about the same.
---
For Two sunders you need 3s of GCD, when you are tanking 5+ mobs there is no issue in getting 12 rage in every 1.5 secons. Also when tanking 5+ Mobs Revenge will be up for the third target 90%+ of the time. With LOS pulls you have (thanks to bloodrage) enough rage for 1 thunder and as already mentioned rage will come in faster then you can get it out with only thunders/revenge. DDs have to be patient when tanking multiple mobs. I normaly mark them on mob so they can nuke it down while I build threat on the rest of the mobs.
---
I agree on the AoE spam. You will need about 10s (build up thread on 4 targets, taunt the 5th as soon as it runs away) of threadbuilding before AoE spam can begin. And  no mage will give you that time. But that´s true for all tanking classes. 
---
I don´t say a warrior is a good AE tank. What i say is, a druid is by no means better. A druid is king in single target threat.
---
What happens to servers with queues still, due to filling more than two layers?
---
I blame Activision.
---
Please any insight from pro tankers, is it important to put 3 points in Improved Revenge and 2 points  in Taunt as a high-level Warrior tank?
---
Ahhh the true vanilla experience
---
I feel like I’m being attributed an argument I’m not saying. It has nothing to do with honor. 
---
If it’s an upgrade you need, if it’s not you greed. If you don’t do this when everyone else in your party adheres to this, you’re an asshole. If everyone in the party needs nobody is the asshole. 
---
I couldn’t care less about gold once I got my epic mount, if you’re really that desperate take the 300 gold BoE and enjoy being blacklisted by half the server.
---
If they removed every RNG element in the game outside of boss drops of likely still play.
---
Of course I benefited from that and that you don't see the problem makes you really... What is wrong with you?
---
I am the only one who can carry a shield why should other roll on it for some gold?
---
Next thing is I roll on mage wands for gold because it does NOT matter if it is worth 50 or 2 gold. It is gold.
---
It does not matter if you steal a plane or a car.... Still not good
---
Till your T2 set. It has a massive buff in damage on it.
---
Wish someone did this with iron on my server.
---
We need some stability in the mining industry.
---
Of all the fonts tho ... Papyrus?
---
That’s about 16 months too long to be honest. It’s really just not that much content. It wasn’t enough content when it was released. We used to all bitch about how slow they rolled out content, and here we are 15 years later at the same speed.
---
Impressive
---
My guess is that bottle neck might be within database sync calls. Blizzard WoW devs are notorious for inability to optimize large scale zones to eliminate possible lags. I’m playing since late TBC/WotLK prepatch and experienced plenty of many participants events which resulted in lags and disconnects, starting with zombie rushes on towns and capitals, starting zones of Cata, MoP, 2nd opening of dark portal, infamous opening garrisons issues which finally leaded to the good but least resistance way solution - split players in smaller chunks to increase parallelism of the whole system. Which in turn resulted in shards in Legion and BfA and layers in Classic. 
---
What if there issues are in the way they are syncing player updates to db? I’ve once read an example of mmo architecture and this problem was highlighted as very hard to solve easily. This also might possibly explain why private servers can handle it easier, they simple care less for data integrity, use different databases and have less players overall.
---
What level are the mobs around the traps?
---
wich is exactly what we did. but apperently im the one who has no idea\^\^
---
This my me in vanilla wow . All the other warlocks in the guild went for gear that was actually good. I wasted my dip on the felheart set
---
We're not saying you're wrong, you're just hyper focused on comparing the items while disregarding the opportunity cost of being 400G in the hole.  What if in the time you farm 400g, you practice your rotation for a couple hours and become a better player?  Or buy consumables that your DPS might otherwise not be able to afford?
---
Bruh I just wanted the teleports

Yeah like when I learned that the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar isn’t a cave and you can see the sky.

You can feasibly make money at any stage of this process.
---
RemindMe! 11 hours
---
You are being really inconsiderate
---
It's also basically the only bad thing to happen so be quiet.
---
I'm a bit worried about how hard this will enforce the faction imbalance (...again). Once honor is made a thing the PvP participation will obviously increase, and the only place we have for that is the open world. I somewhat do expect to see what happened back then on retail servers over time just in fast-forward.
---
If you're horde on a PvP realm you're fine, if you're alliance and happen to play on one of the already more common horde dominated realms you'll be suddenly be a target everywhere. Getting ganked every 5 minutes because there's already a higher horde pop probably won't be that much fun for casual alliance players and I fear that the whole faction balance thing tilts hard (...again).
---
Sure, this also works the other way around, horde just tends to dominate harder because of the racials. I don't really look forward to realms that are (...AGAIN) heavily dominated by one faction. Before they overhauled wPvP and made it irrelevant my server was like 94% horde, and even as horde player wPvP kind of suffered because of it.
---
Not sure if there's anything that could or should be done because of that, but I wouldn't be that surprised if we somewhen do end up with the old red or blue realms... What kind of sucks if they want classic to be around for a while.
---
What is this quest and where can i get it?
---
Do you like, drop a group of totems and pull mobs into it one at a time?  Hard to see how that would be time efficient if not.

Not sure why you think the first week of September classifies as “nowadays”. That was a month ago.

was wondering the same thing
---
Undead rogue, I /spit on people.
---
I play rogue and I always allow everyone to roll on these and free open (no tips) boxes in a dungeon. I’ve gone to a specific area three times in total to level up but otherwise have always done so from my own boxes or by advertising in Org. Anyone who thinks that it takes effort comparable to any crafting profession is crazy. I make bank off of pickpocketing already so why should I be stingy in dungeon groups?
---
I multiboxed 5 toons and every time I crafted new bags I gave away 5 sets in whatever town I was repairing in. People were super thankful for something I would have just vendored. A couple of people even mailed them back to me when they upgraded to a larger bag.
---
Like the sisterhood of the YaYa bags.
---
You need a shield so you can use it on the warlock eye.

The raids will be easier compared to 2005 for sure, but AQ/Naxx will still be a step up, you gotta remember that the MC we face on Classic is a watered down version compared to Vanilla, since we have access to 1.12 Classes, talents, debuff slots and itemisation which all in all make a pretty large difference, the 1.12 Class changes isn't talked about much, but Blizzard did buff the Classes a fair amount over the 2 years of Vanilla. Not saying Naxx will be hard, I can't predict how the average guild will find it, but there definitely will be a steady increase in difficulty.
---
"wale cum" will make me gquit every time.
---
Ah, good to know. I thought something was off about that; I think the talents changed around then, too. Or perhaps it's my aged memory failing me. Thanks for the clarification.
---
No :( 
---
Car broke down, had to take the train...train was cancelled, went over to the bus...missed the first, second one was full, got on the third and suffered immensely. Now I am at work, 1½ hours after i initially planned on being here, and the coffee machine is broke...People asking for tanks for WC is just that little nudge that makes me fall off the edge... :(
---
I don't get it. How is this bad for someone who tries undercutting him?
---
So he has 1g40s a stack. If you place 1g30s or even 1g a stack and he buys it to see at his price, you're still profiting more than when the AH has many randome competitors undercutting you and dropping the price to something like 20s or less.
---
I'd drop everything I had to give it to him and make more than I would otherwise, but I may be missing something.
---
Our guild actually does the same thing.
---
I'm on one of the fuller pvp servers.
---
If they couldn't use the item either, then this is just scummy as feck.
---
Best proffesions foe Rogue?
---
I am currently running Mining + Engineering.
---
I've seen most Rogues use Skinning + Leatherworking. 
---
Should I swap? I am quite advsnced with both proffesions atm.
---
You can hardly abuse it.
---
People like you who whine, do you even understand how it works anymore? You cant just jump between layer to layer to farm infinite mobs.
---
You get ONE extra clear of mobs every hour, if even that. That is pretty hard to abuse
---
They used the clip in ROTC about 6 years ago when I was there.
---
Also, S2 here, I credit being a raid leader as to why I am good at briefing.
---
Yeah he killed my bear druid and the healer had no chance of keeping me up. I'd probably try kiting it instead of facetanking. 
---
Also, it deals nature dam. not phys :(
---
One of us!!
---
You are pathetic for doing that
---
&gt; seem to suggest that you in fact do not believe that the lag in player-dense areas is a problem.
---
You are literally insane. LOOK at what you fucking quoted! READ it! WHERE in ANY WAY does it even REMOTELY allude to the idea that I don't think lag is a problem? How could you fucking POSSIBLY get that out of that?
---
Don't answer. Ya blocked son
---
tl;dr
---
Aggroing mobs off of the group is literally your job as a tank and it‘s not useless. We healers thank you for doing this. Tanks dealing the lowest dps is normal (excluding healers of course).
---
Maintanks are not in very short supply tho, as you only need one...
---
Vanilla is 70% guild management and 30% execution.

And then consider people trying to tame broken tooth the rare cat in the badlands. Most people are now reaching badlands level, most hunters are reaching the level where they can tame him and his 3 spawn locations are all in high traffic areas.

Being in the most densely populated bracket for levelling is not great, haha. 60 will be even more fun once everyone catches up.

Thanks, i gonna look into it when i will arrive to home.

Well that sucks. You'l have to leave work early to make yourself feel better.

That's why my Assassin's Blade is sitting in my bank for the time being. I'm not even 40 anyways, so why sell it now?

If somebody truly has a good use for an item I would gladly pass it to them. Again you're totally derailing what the discussion is about, like, whoa.

Sadly some people started to get pissy about it however there are still those of us that think it's all the more funny because of how tired other people are of it.

Spent two levels from 37-39 looking for BT. Two days ago I woke up in the middle of the night from an odd dream and decided to log on to scan for BT and voilá there he was.

&gt;If you have enough cash like few thousand gold you can take control of the market but is it really worth it?

absolutely, if you can set and maintain the long term price floor to 3 or 4 times what it was the amount it takes you to cause that change will be minimal compared to what you make in the long run.

That's BJ not KY

Isn't that dragon taming orc clan camp, there should a path to get in there, I think that there also an entrance between the tunnel from wetland to dwarf zone.

Hey man,

Tahnks, finally some critizism! ;)
---
The theorycrafting made behind the healing columns on the sheet is more of a versatile BiS setup. I'm sure you and I both know that there is no #1. BiS setup of items when it comes to healers. It all depends on the role you have. There are potentially 4 BiS sets for a healer; raw healing, crit healing, mana reg or a more versatile setup. To best cover all requirements in one column, I chose the latter.
---
I hope that somewhat answers your question.
---
the region is america and more than (as an operator) does not include 3. the one that does is "or more". so the bluepost is talking about realms in america had 4+ layers the first week of september.

none of that applies to what im saying in my comment.

or Dec 1st., one of the two.
---
At 33 you should just stay in instances until 48, more or less. SM &gt; ZF. If the realm has a high enough pop, it should work out just fine.
---
Otherwise you'll most likely have to play during off times.
---
Google server sided issues, sorry...
---
I've never played classic SM before because i started in MoP (or late cata to be precise), and it's crazy how they just gutted the whole instance, removing several parts of the original one!
---
i love the old one so far!

I agree, blizzard plants are totally unclear, they are totally green!

And we're going to farm this shit for months.

1) Sounds like an issue either on your end or your ISP. Not having it.
---
2) See 1
---
3) If you're fully kitted, play other games, roll alts, do professions. There's a ton of stuff to see/do besides hitting 60.
---
4) See 1
---
5) See 3
---
6) Somewhat legitimate but we'll have to wait and see.
---
7) People knowing things is good, and means we'll have a larger selection of players and healthier playerbase at level cap.
---
8) Must be your server.
---
9) Known about at the beginning, weak argument.
---
10) Untrue

Use leatrix map and you will be able to see that part without discovering it :D
---
Literally noone cares about reputation on big servers. And he calls it a tip in his advertisments.
---
I think most I ever caught was like 4-5 but Im not on one of the highest population servers. I bet there were never over 15 anywhere, and they would have only been in the first days where they couldnt impact the economy significantly.
---
Wow this is really hard for you, huh?
---
Probably what I will do. I want to get 60 first though. Maybe once world pvp is up, I will have the fun with pvp that I need. Because at the moment, killing the other people is useless
---
Died while dead?
---
I think I did this accidentally :D bought some 250 Kingsblood over the weekend for like 1s/piece... then on monday there was a time when there was 0 Kingsblood on the AH, so I listed mine for 2g30s a stack, probably resetting the price for the week. Also sold many stacks in trade chat for 2g/ stack.
---
Someone tried to gkick but they typed gquick. So now we threaten to gquick everyone.
---
BG's aint in phase 2 though are they? Have to wait till phase 3 for that :/
---
It's smoother with a tank.
---
Seeing "STV 30-45" always makes me not want to make an alt. God I hate that zone just from a leveling standpoint since I don't play on pvp servers.

What an awful zone

yeah same

Then move to a pve server

Oh I didn't know it was nature, how could you see? I survived with my warrior but it was a close one !

This is one way to look at it. Another way is to observe how the unregulated market unfolds. This can be really fun (and perhaps even profitable for you) to track over time.

The vast majority of people aren't even 60 yet, this gives everyone time to get to max and get some gear ready for pvp.

Well to be honest I have had almost no server lagg problems with large amounts of people in the same place.
---
All other small flaws that exist are kind of part of the classic experience, yes there are things that are completely broken but that is also kinda fun.
---
The fact that people already know what content is coming I don't see as a problem. People just love some games and will always return to them. Also classic is way more grindy which will keep most people bussy for quiete a while.
---
Yes a part of the population might get burned out at some point, but there are currently more then enough people to keep the classic servers running for some years to come.
---
Layering never really presented a huge issue for me once I understood it. Before I knew how it worked, I stood in the exact spot my boyfriend was in in the barrens after travelling for 15 minutes to meet up with him, staring at his laptop screen wondering why we couldn't see each other. Then I invited him to a group through the social tab and he magically appeared in front of me. Slight pain for a bit, but we got it figured out lol

I could kill Tinkerer without problems but Princess was impossible. She has 25k hp and hits me for 250. I was oom when she was 50%, just by dotting and mind blasting + vampiric embrace.

No. It's not an emulation. It's the old data and scripting modified to run on the new engine, along with some engine changes to accommodate some old behavior that had changed over the years.

I assume OP is talking about lvl 60 farming, cause if he doesnt, he is dumb as a stone.

Ofc I'll have the Warrior 2h tank the instance instead of whatever bad crap we already had when we invited him.

If anyone is &lt; 60 and asks a warrior to tank with a sword and a shield, he is beyond hopeless.

I'm guessing he was trying to make "Elchapo" new party leader but instead kicked him.
---
I agree :(

What makes ya wanna go sp next?

Fireworks and smoke rings, also made the little folks rich.
---
Think of each realm has having several layers, like a cake.
---
Now, imagine that each realm had a population cap of 10,000 people before there were queues.
---
With layering, those 10,000 people are split into different, well, layers of the game world. If they split it into 4 layers, in an ideal scenario, there'd be 4 virtual worlds, each with 2,500 people on them. 4 Eastern Plaguelands, 4 Stormwinds, 4 Ironforges.
---
That is what layering is.
---
I find it smoother with more DPS. Melee or hunters, not someone who has to sit down too much.
---
Yeah the talents changed to the new ones. I remember destroying pvp with the newborn Felguard! :D
---
&gt;The net-code feels like garbage. 30-500 ms spikes constantly. This is even during "down times"
---
I have 50-70ms since launch - no spikes whatsoever. So try to find out why you have these spikes.
---
&gt;The current pace of phases feels WAAAAY to slow for the small amount of content being phased in for some of them.
---
Speak for yourself. Not everyone has time to play 16hrs a day and I think this is going at the best pace possible. Or do you really want to get to Naxx as fast as possible and then just drop the game for no new content. It should take a long time to get to Naxx. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. If you really wanna just go through it fast, go to a pserver.
---
&gt;bg's and bwl come out at the same time (WHY?) wsg should come out for Phase 2 if you want classic to survive.
---
Classic is gonna survive anyway, it's been surviving for the last 15 years and now it's reborn with more players than you can imagine.
---
&gt;This one is actually pretty big. The "melee leeway" code was created by a 5 year old. There is no predictive scaling to it. Its simply if your back is turned at any time to a melee, regardless of movement, speed, or ping , then melee range becomes larger then the range of frost nova or cone of cold. Its really silly. This did not come close to existing in this way in original classic and i think its going to ruin and unbalance pvp even more.
---
Leeway existed in vanilla because of shitty internet back then. Please do research before posting.
---
And it's not if your back is turned. Leeway starts when characters are moving. The movement triggers leeway.
---
I agree they should change leeway back, so it's not as big of a range.
---
&gt;People know the content, nothing is new, everything is known, best leveling paths, methods, best gold per hour farming spots , best gear you should have for every upcoming phase, how to beat every raid boss and whats the best strategy to use. The chosen place to start? A buffed gear and nerfed MC starting point.. making EVEN PVE right now very dull and boring. Theres no grind for flask or potions to use for raids because there is no need the content is to easy. The economy suffers from this as well.
---
What are you doing in classic then? Go play retail.
---
&gt;Lack of a strong community. I personally feel like one of the reasons wow classic had such a strong community was because the grind was long but rewarding. Sticking with a guild and helping the guild itself progress was the reward and having a strong guild/community was necessary to achieve this. All these streamers and easy content have turned the current wow classic experience into a very selfish experience. 
---
On my server the community is very nice and strong. I'm also in a nice guild where everyone helps each other and it's been long since I had such a nice online experience in a game.
---
Streamers? I don't watch them and I don't read about them. They don't affect my gameplay at all. There can be a thousand streamers and it won't affect how I play the game. 
---
&gt;Class imbalance. Its a well known fact which are the best classes for doing what and you can see it very clearly when you do any big raid.
---
Again, go play retail. We love classic for what it is. I'm a druid. I'm not optimal, but man I have so much fun playing this game than anything on retail. Any class I play brings something to the table and classes have personality in classic. You know what they are and what they do. It's just...classic.
---
Can confirm, no need for mount either.
---
&gt;ok i ranted enough but its my going away wall of text while i become a tuesday only player and decide if thats worth my $15 a month sub for 8 hours of my time a month.
---
8 hours a month for $15 is still a bargain. This game entertains me much higher than stupid cinema movies.
---
I hit 27ms last night, it's the end of the world I tell you!
---
Keep engineering, buy your leathers.
---
Seriously though, showing the Leeroy Jenkins video is a good example of how not to attack irl lol
---
I joined my guilds MC run, we went in and did about an hour of MC trash to grind epics. Great.
---
Then an hour later someone else was doing Trash MC runs, so i joined.  During the run I noticed in /raidinfo It said, Onxyia Raid #:349494, then Molten Core raid # 348959 and I went beserk thinking they locked me to an instance.
---
They and other people claimed their raid info was empty... So i left the group.  Then I got invited by a level 40 who made the party to a raid and zoned in, I mind visioned my way and say Lucifron, Magmadar, Gehensis, Garr... So I am confused if I am really saved or if this was a bug from being in two mcs' maybe???
---
Scared I wont get to guild run tomorrow...
---
Anyone else have this issue???
---
Something I gotta do more often in WoW or games in general is to look up, so many nice details everywhere. Like yesterday when someone posted a pic of the ”roof” in maraudon and it was beautiful.
---
Depends on level. BrD can be done level 56+ with no tanks. 2h plate wearer is def doable.
---
34-36 if i recall correctly, its got a repeatable quest there for horde however for turning in 5 shellfish for 55s, you can usually get about 40 shellfish in 30 mins tho, so its worth the farm just for the money if its not busy
---
Thank god, now I can level my warrior alt in peace.
---
Seeing all these posts make me really worried. Im currently On a 6 week trip to China and Like to play Wow when i have free time. Atm Im playing with 4g hotspotted from my phone and using a vpn. But Im still worried that i Will Get for no reason

With layering, those 10,000 people are split into different, well, layers of the game world. If they split it into 4 layers, in an ideal scenario, there'd be 4 virtual worlds, each with 2,500 people on them. 4 Eastern Plaguelands, 4 Stormwinds, 4 Ironforges, 4 "layers" of the entire world, each with it's own contained players.
---
The only way that's true is if you believe he's entitled to a spot in the group.
---
Good
---
Yeah it can go smooth with all kinds of combinations I quess. In pugs I like a stable tank that sets the pace and navigation. I mostly heal so it makes sense I likr tanks. :D
---
Full servers are literally unplayable with 1 layer FYI
---
I'm having fun and have no issues besides wanting to play more.
---
That is what layering is. It's a bit more nuanced (as each zone contains X layers, and it's not always the same across zones etc).
---
Yea I feel like they definitely reduced the layers too fast for prime-time players.  
---
But alas, it's too late to change now anyway. And yesterday actually wasn't too bad in STV. :P
---
I dont get why he is best pirate? this makes no sense . Still nice save tho
---
Stupid gnome aggro'd dungeon, Gandalf straight tanked Balrog to save the party. Can't disagree with the rest though.
---
nice! i followed you on twitch also.
---
So we had a huge recruiting spurt there for awhile and this guy got recruited right as a raid member logged in, now whenever he logs in we hit him with every welcome copy pasta we got.
---
You hate yourself?
---
That's like saying BRM is a bitch for horde because everyone's hs is in Org. But it's not.
---
A very useful macro that will use max rank in raids and r1 in groups/solo:
---
/cast [group:raid] Curse of Recklessness; Curse of Recklessness(Rank 1)
---
Layering is purely for improving the player experience of questing in what would be a crowded area on an unlayered server.  It has absolutely zilch to do with server stability.  Layers are continent wide, not zone wide, which indicates that you are incorrect when you claim that too many people in one “zone” will cause instability.  Both layers are on the same physical machine, the only difference is that the client can’t see shit going on in different layers so the game feels less crowded and more ppl can get their quests done.  The server has to actually handle MORE load with layering because it’s dealing with multiple times as many mobs as an unlayered server.
---
I feel so skeptical about all these "look at my character posts" Until layering is gone, who knows, this guy could've have abused the mechanic to get all those pieces
---
So layers are like hidden realms within realms.
---
Wouldnt that make the world more sparse and therefore a bad thing? Eg youre LFG or WTS in layer 1 but everyone who wants to do that group or buy that thing is sitting in the other 3 layers?
---
Thanks! 
---
Mind controlling people off the Zeppelin must be the funniest shit!
---
Maybe 15 years ago it was an issue. I have landed jobs just due to the raid lead bullet point. Video games don't really have much of a stigma anymore, those of us that grew up playing games are now the ones doing the hiring most of the time.
---
If you know what things are worth this can be a good tactic. I mostly use it when people undercut the market price a lot. Some people can post it at 50% of the nearest competitor so I can just buy does double the price and just undercut the fair prices. It will probably sell in minutes if it is a commodity. Maybe not kingsblood though never had any luck with that herb.
---
It’s ElvUI
---
Yes. https://clips.twitch.tv/SpoopyDoubtfulSnailKappaRoss.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why. It doesn't exactly feel like we lack Priests or anything.
---
I get paid to tank dungeons, I'd say good tanks are still pretty relevant
---
Like some ganker described it: "I prevent enemy players from gathering reources, be it exp, quest mobs or trade goods, so our faction can be stronger"
---
No, the game is about setting goals for yourself and going out and reaching them.
---
Am priest, please bring six pack and I’ll bring the heals!
---
the pattern dood
---
We say "Guild's gone to shit!" everytime someone joins.
---
Id rather just pick to heal for groups with actual tanks, luckily theres no shortage of demand for healers
---
This guys a dick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OYmcfU5pTc
---
Sort of. For open world things, it'd mean you see less people. But you are able to "hop" layers by having someone invite you to theirs. So if there was player 1 on layer A, and player 2 on layer B, player 1 could invite player 2, and he would transition to layer A. Once again, there's more nuance there (there is now a cooldown period between hopping layers, etc), but that's the jist of it.
---
However, with the massive population on every realm, it was a necessity at the launch. I'm not sure if you played day 1 or not, but starting zones literally had thousands of people in them, and that was *with* layering splitting everyone up.
---
Why does it matter if people want to speak in Gchat or discord, I much prefer gchat unless im doing a dungeon, I dont wanna voice with someone 24/7
---
...and there are a good amount of people at the AH most of the time, so what's your point?
---
I made a decent amount of money in the early days of Classic, simply by sitting at the AH and buying literally anything listed for less than the vendor price - even if it was just a single copper less.
---
I sometimes still just sit at the AH (for much shorter time periods, though), when I log into my bank alt.
---
It's sorta like those people who will tell you, that they know someone at the company and they can get you banned: "My dad owns Blizzard :) Goodbye your account :) Say farewell to all your gold. He will transfer it to my account now :) Goodbye :))".
---
You mean that beautiful human priestess, Thighmane?
---
see, you're not even taking into consideration the healer's experience or how hard you drain his mana lol
---
This is how I play as well. I group up with my IRL buddies and siblings and we quest together. Every so often I tell them over discord to watch my back so I can go pee or get a snack. We haven't done any dungeons all the way through or anything yet, but I play because I think the game is really fun and the world is huge. I'm new to wow and I'm so happy that all of my friends that i play with are as well. We're all on this hard ass learning curve together and it makes it way more fun and a lot less stressful.
---
Why’s that
---
Lmao, did not know that was possible...
---
Straight up bullying.
---
I agree, for the player who got time to play 4 hours a day and weekends, I would prefer this amount of time or more...
---
YOU
---
FUCK YOU

Dump the girlfriend and grind to 60
---
We hit em with the :O
---
AOE-grind or normal grind?
---
I already want to leave this guild
---
Grats
---
and these will be the guilds that spam inv the whole zone and no one speaks in
---
Anywhere high level seems way chill.  Strange
---
And perhaps some alt leveling for other professions/fun. There's loads to do! I won't be running out of content anytime soon.
---
The hero we needed.
---
But I absolutely am. The marginal extra damage I take is offset by the fact the mobs die a lot quicker, and that I hold aggro a lot better so the healer doesn’t need to spread heals. If the healer is struggling with 2h, then I’ll switch to shield - but the difference is generally marginal with slower kills.
---
Lmao sweet summer child
---
We did MC with 27 people earlier up to Rag, we teamed another guild to do it. Plenty of people are raiding MC without 40 mans now, everyone who is raiding right now knows what to do.
---
We have a guy named Ibombay that’s only ever said I am ibombay. We hope he sticks with it cause the guild flips shit when he does it.
---
This reminds of back in vanilla, pre cross realm BG’s.  AB started and it was our full premade alliance group vs a solitary horde. In the short time before BG closed thru lack of players we found and MCed the one horde guy and buffed him with every buff we had, including full pally buffs.
---
Hopefully, it gets a GM too. The amount of non-RP names is absolutely staggering and reporting them does absolutely nothing. I mean, one of the bigger guilds is named &lt;TRASH&gt;...
---
You only pull stunts like this when the prices are a lot lower then regular. You don’t buy from people undercutting you at a fair/above fair price. You cancel your own auctions (or you don’t post all of your stash at once) and post them again undercutting any undercutters.
---
Can anyone recommend a place to get this printed so I can make a poster?  I don't have a ton of experience getting large things printed online.
---
Whenever a DPS dies while I'm healing, I say "You probably deserved it"
---
This is gold
---
Forget the devout mantle, that boss drops the TRUE pre raid BiS belt for priests. So still a very valid point. I brought it up a bunch of times and am shot down everytime but being as all i still need is the rune off jed, i dont do full runs anymore and i love when people ask me to heal a full run, "ha fuck no". I settled for the second BiS belt from undead strath and now i have my T1 belt. Fuck UBRS lol
---
I feel the same way! I had too many quest items taking up space in my bag so I ditched the quests while I was on the other continent, then completed a few there and went back and picked up the ones that I abandoned.
---
I usually work on leveling my professions when I need a break from leveling.
---
Oof.
---
doing more dps than the average warrior in my stratholme pugs really makes you think
---
Wait a second where is your eye of the beast!
---
Nice power word shield frim this priest...
---
Serious question, are they going to have this fixed by AV coming out? Because that BG is where all my fondest memories from the game come from. I really hope they are still the full scale 4 hour+ tooth and nail fight for an inch battles and not the hugely scaled back final version ....
---
Yeah and my alt is always at the AH with a scan going.
---
But how does crusaders str buff compare to LS's 30 damage procs ?
---
This is really the truth. I think a good amount of people will be excited right out of the gate, but in practice a lot of people that aren't hardcore WPVP'ers could get fed up with it (I'm referring to servers with heavily lopsided faction populations especially). I'm on a PvP server mostly cause my friends chose the server and while i enjoy pvp and while i'm gonna focus on BG's much much much more than i'll ever do raiding this time around (I got way too much of that in OG vanilla for my own good), I still am not gonna be making hunting squads and going gung-ho for every opportunity to WPVP.
---
 I'm gonna be how I always have been; Wanting to farm alchemy mats in peace or gold grinding in peace. Even now I'm very often just ignoring the other faction and playing passively unless they're jumping be first. 
---
I'd MUCH rather just have BG's alongside the Honor phase 2 release. Give us Warsong phase 2, alterac and arathi phase 3, then have phase 4 saved for PvE AQ and phase 5 for Naxx. I already know I'm not gonna commit to shit in phase 4 or 5 cause I dont wanna raid with my time outside of very occasional pug MC or BWL if and only if it just so happens to fits my night's availability for it.
---
Hopefully he’s a sexy female irl
---
Are we to assume you're level 60?
---
you'll be fine
---
Thanks! I really like using some of these older songs again :)
---
Ah yeah. An addon by the same name aswhat you called it
---
That's awesome!
---
Is it possible to have this kind of mape in-game as an addon? That would be the perfect blend for me!
---
Auctionator (addon) can help by also showing a rough auction value on items you pick up. You scan the auctionhouse from time to time to keep up.
---
What nameplates addon are you using? Would like to see my debuffs on them like you :&gt;
---
You can still dps in berserk/arms. Imagine respec for heal/dps twice a week for raids. You'll go bankrupt.
---
People advise to take gnomish and the relearn for goblin but this is just a waste of money in my opinion.
---
Just take goblin and buy all the gnome trinkets from a gnome engineer. Afaik there are only 2 BOP gnome trinkets. The death ray and the battle chicken. The death ray is fun but not not really important for a hunter. You also get a different teleporter (Gadgezan) but I learn gnome engi specifically for that.
---
&gt; Ele shamans do great dps but mana is a big issue drinking all the time. I went herb alchemy so I can chug mana pots as I instance too.
---
There are ways to reduce the downtime of drinking mana [this goes into a solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0-17Sp62eI) involving equiping Mp5/spirit gear while travelling.
---
*cries in prot war*
---
LEEEEEROOOOOY
---
Damn nice
---
Swingtimer is absolutely mandatory for rogue.
---
I aint in a rush. While i enjoyed my friends telling me when i was uust starting in late BC about gearing, im just taking at one step at a time. In 37 now and im proud of it. There's  a bunch of phases. When naxx hits the other raids will be on farm for most guilds and so i feel no need to rush. Im most looking foward to BGs and honor really.
---
You can use gnomish trinkets when you are goblin engineer ? 🤔
---
I have never had an issue staying alive, just threat. So it’s pretty true.
---
Could be someone just happened to looked for items that sold under vendor at the time. Auctioneer can search that up pretty quickly. Or maybe he just happened to look at rocks and then saw the price. I was spambuying Runecloth for 1g10s (a really good price on my server) from a guy. I thought the AH was glitched or something, since the auction seemingly never disappeared. Then he sent me a /w along the lines of "stop buying all my runecloth lol".
---
I have also bought up items sold under vendor price thanks to Auctioneer filtering. This shouldn't be possible on one of the biggest EU servers if people run bots capable of instant sniping.
---
So either confirmation bias or someone sit on a very powerful in house tool.
---
while we don't have Honor yet, we always have Lulz
---
Ah yeah it's an addon on the twitch app. I saw it suggested in another thread here
---
You should have looked up the video - it tells you about how much mana you need to have to even do it. 
---
I’ve done princess with mostly leveling gear and a few BiS pieces
---
Theres a lot of links here. Is there one without the flight paths and without the (levels) I did find one without the flight paths but it only had the major city names and it was a bit bare.
---
It's always faster to swim from the coast to feathermoon, but if the boat is already there it's faster to take it from feathermoon to the coast.
---
The death ray is important when you're deadzoned by a mage.
---
Yea fuck liquidated. 2 of their rogue straight ninjaed a whole dungeon run full of greens
---
The anal meme doesnt work as well on classic unfortunately. It just shows up as words, not links.
---
The 1% is much more important to me than the shit building up to it.
---
Are you serious ?
---
Nice to see a fellow shaman exploring an unconventional spec. Myself I play a Raid Shaman TANk and Im always interested in seeing others play something out of the loop and rewarding in the end.
---
hear the tune of the 56k modem?
---
dark ages all over again
---
A very small minority of players have cleared MC so far and even those will raid it for a long time, so no need to worry
---
Excuse me, what? Are you saying the eyes *only* drop from the Solakar waves? If that's what you're saying then you're lying or delusional.
---
Level 50 hard to see sorry
---
Oh yeah that’s right. But I wouldn’t recommend solo AoE grinding, the spots are very contested. And normal grind is honestly very low efficiency
---
I had to ask my friend earlier to stop sundering, he got a rank up on me and I couldn't hold any aggro.
---
He's 48 and dw fury, his icyveins guide told him to help get to 5 sunders asap.
---
If you can find a way to insert wow into SHARP training you deserve a medal sir.
---
You did the ”exploit” leveling and only now hit 60?
---
How dare you have things to do before being 60 out in the real world. Shame sir.
---
Why bring his dad into it
---
Only time I've ever had that happen was when I used to play on some pservers...was honestly amusing.
---
doesn't take more than 30 seconds to find out if someone is a bot or a real player at least if you've been taking part in the mmo for a while. paladine / mages with Hrduutugggx names doing the same skill rotation 24/7 for over 2 weeks at the same spot after several reports and screenshots/videos to proof, even a newbie should know that this is not a real player. or the friendly hunters with boar pets named "Boar" killing all wild animals, skinning them and after 2 seconds turning exactly 180° go for the next mob over and over again.here you can definitely differentiate from grinders and bots ... Duskwood near the ogre resort Vol'Gun as well as STV near Gorillas/Tiger/Panther Spots are massively affected atleast on my Server DragonsCall.
---
Normal clip of warrior using recklessness.
---
Every time someone leaves the guild, the leader or an officer will say "add him to the kill list" and everyone replies "agreed". It's silly but it makes me smile.
---
If ur not my healer or his mana bar, you dont get my soulstone.
---
you need to kite with only dot.
---
I've heard of making shaman tank work in dungeons but don't think I've seen much of it in raids. That's bad ass dude
---
Bc you’ll b Pals For Life now
---
I have a fulltime job and other things i do besides wow, but i have still cleared MC and ony twice. 
---
I know it's not the norm, but we can still have a life :D
---
We do this as well, but went with &lt;Zug Life&gt;
---
The one thing I agree with in this whole post is that BGs should be in phase 2. It's bizarre to me that PvP is being so heavily staggered. I suppose it reflects how PvP was rolled out from start to finish of Vanilla, so in a way it's authentic, but it really is a crazy amount of time to wait for any PvP content besides world...
---
troll lvl warlock
---
I hate people who roll for offspec while leveling. Saw some shitty green item drop, but it’s better than their 20 levels too low green since the last time they healed, so they are rolling need. 
---
At the same time I understand the frustration against warriors. If you won’t tank a dungeon to make it happen, I would rather get a different dps. Because the tank I do find doesn’t want you taking his gear.
---
You don't talk to people inside? Weird.
---
&gt;rogue is one of the hardest classes to level
---
Excuse me what the fuck now
---
Well your opinion is the very definition of greed and there’s a button for that.
---
I suppose that’s true.  It just appears to be a lot as everytime I’m in a capitol city I see people decked out in raid gear.
---
No we don't.
---
Servers won't be able to handle. FPS might he good, but network feedback will make you lagg anyway.
---
How much would he have made doing something like this?
---
More like they were wanting to combat the fact that there would multiple hundreds of people in the starting areas. No one would really be able to play if there were 400 people in the starting area, so they created multiple layers in each server to reduce this overcrowding. Each sever has X number of layers and each layer has approximately 1/Xth of the players on that server. Now that not everyone is in the starting area, and everyone has spread out across Azeroth, they can reduce theses layers because the significant overcrowding of a single area isn't much of a problem anymore.
---
The problem is that the entire playerbase didn't start on the first day of vanilla and as such they didn't have to wait so long. EU actually had a very short wait even if you did start at the launch.
---
Here's a tip almost no one knows for Jandice trash: if your healer is a priest or paladin, the magic immune mobs can be killed by their holy spells.
---
Solution: Use a druid. We don't have any of these problems. We can hold the damage, dish out a lot of threat and decent DPS at the same time.
---
Kingsblood is one of the easiest herbs to find in the game. There's very little reason to buy it. This was a poor choice.
---
would have better result if this was barrens chat
---
What ui is that?
---
very VERY true, those were some of my worst memories from playing paladin back in the day
---
guild officer: hey we need you to heal tonight
---
me: ok but I'm currently specced prot for farming
---
guild officer: well respec
---
my internal dialogue: there goes another 50 gold
---
day after the raid, still stuck in holy, might as well be someones healbot in pvp because I'm broke as f**k anyway
---
non hybrid classes have it so easy they don't even realise the hassle of having to respec everytime you want to do some solo stuff or actually have some fun with your class, this is why I've decided to not raid anymore, unless the guild foots the bill for my constant respecs, I'm not playing this class so I can be the guilds healbot, so they can get sweet new gear, meanwhile if I wanted dps gear I'd get the shaft because I can only get healer gear first.
---
I want to have some fun too bro!!
---
;)
---
No, no one is successfully running ret or shockadin in raids.
---
In vanilla cool downs are cool downs. 
---
Not ”once per fight” godmode
---
And it shares CD with reck and Wall.
---
Your loss
---
In my guild they sometimes when someone comes online start spamming "Shazaa" or "Kazaa" or something like this.
---
me too
---
What are you doing here then?
---
The problem with almost all professions now is that there’s too much supply. At high level even fishing should be profitable, but many people aren’t focusing on the things that enable fishing to be profitable at the moment.
---
It’s the same reason why selling silk, for example, isn’t making any decent money at the moment.
---
You may want to edit your original post and use a low-res version of the map, because the preview thumbnail still took a minute or two to display the image for me on a fast connection.
---
How were they able to scan this image in such high detail without losing quality?

Haha, when you tell a PVPer that PVP be coming his way ';...;'
---
What is HP?
---
Sure man, I'm playing Horde on Faerlina. 
---
Feel free to message me for my IGN!
---
Improved revenge is good for running dungeons, especially if you're prone to dying. Not so much for raiding.
---
Improved taunt is good, as many things can go wrong.
---
GY is really worth the spam for rare elite spawn. The blue gear they drop is pretty great.
---
marginal? lol
---
idk man, some of these warriors are absolutely getting trashed must be in zerker stance or something but thats really how they think they should tank
---
People also didn't stop doing MC once BWL was released.
---
I can tell you it’s really not that much fun, also I have to put a lot more thought into tanking than dps. Once you get shield slam and stuff, I think tanking is fun.
---
Yeah because I don’t have any downtime lol. I kill like 8 mobs (double pull, single pull pattern) then pop a mageweave bandage and move onto the next pull.
---
Lol.
---
thx.
---
You're comment makes it seem like you used it. If that's the case, you can't sell it.
---
For some reason I always have "release the hounds!" stuck in my head.
---
Wow you are really on top of your comment game today, ey son?
---
Good point. 
---
OP just has to decide if it is worth it to him.
---
I'm going to do his quest soon and I fully intend on rewatching River Monsters while I do it.
---
When a BoE epic drops, it is an equal upgrade to every person in the group regardless of their class/spec, thanks to that thing most people call the “Auction House”. Not sure if you’ve heard of it, you should check it out though :D
---
I'm using the basilisk bone, which is +8 (or 6?) all resistances. Pretty lame, but better than empty.
---
Bleaumeux?
---
That's what ruined CS:GO and basically any other competitive game for me.
---
Should be able to if you add a second trigger.  Select the WeakAura on the left pane, then the Triggers tab, then the green plus sign to add a new trigger.  Then configure it [like this.](https://imgur.com/9TDf0DA)
---
Can't test it at the moment, but that should do the trick.
---
What? They're raiding for 3 hours a week. They hit 60 during their rush and excitement and now they log in to raid. Why is that unbelievable?
---
I'm in a guild called The Lovely Lads where we call everyone LAD (always in all caps) when someone leaves everyone types notaLAD.
---
It’s sad that this is basically the norm because I used to occasionally friend request people after a ridiculous game to laugh about it but they would always decline :(
---
He can only do this for so long and will result in him losing money.
---
If he has done this right he picked an item that is undervalued, otherwise it's 100% a game from his side.
---
I think you have to learn leadership from guy called "Dave" from  **Wipe Club**
---
can u tell where pls?
---
I don't blame anyone, I just said how it looks now compared to the good old days, while we pay the same amount of money. Anyway, fucking insensitive is to ban people who did nothing because GM is pushed by corporate rules and speed of "resolving" issues. If you want to talk this way....    
---
Anyway if you can read, I even said that there are great GM's, so don't blame it all on corporate. It's up to the individuals how do they want to handle things ;)
---
which means it's not nowadays

This is AMAZING! I've been looking for a great map of Azeroth to print and hang on my wall, and this might be it 😁
---
the stamina skill seem very lackluster tbh. You get something like 400 more hp for your pet with endurance rank 10. Whereas the armour one is great, it's something like a 10% increase to your pet's physical damage reduction.
---
The resistances are quite good since they give your pet a good chance to completely resist some spells which include debuffs and cc.
---
&gt;For this action to work you need limited supply. 
---
Exactly. Until you're dealing with end game materials this will never work. Maybe one or two gold of profit for all that effort....when you can literally just kill a single mob in a level 60 zone and earn the same payout.
---
Thank you, I prefer people who can backup what they say, you’re one of them.
---
Yea I was hoping for more time as well. Phase 2 maybe in March or something. I don't want to start playing "fast" just to not feel left behind. I get why they're doing it, but I'm disappointed
---
My life for the past 8 years.

Lots of people say that wow is an expensive game, at 15 a month, those same people buy one or two games as 60 a pop per month, some of those game has dlc that costs quite a bit for sometimes very little content but the price adds up. 
---
Wow is indeed very cheap for an incredible amount of content.
---
Even in the game. What would you report?
---
what
---
I really don’t understand this closed minded thinking, gear will scale better and we’re going to gain the benefit of spell power in our itemization that we lack in MC, not to mention better weapons — I don’t understand how this statement can be made other then sheepish regurgitation. 
---
There’s more to someone’s raid potential other then class and people forget that the player can make a big difference.
---
It gives you easily accessible knowledge of nearby players.

Let me paint you a picture. A lvl 29 horde player is walking through STV, killing tigers and shit, when a lvl 35 alliance player spots the horde scum - poor little horde player gets obliterated, and runs to his corpse. Before ressing, he checks if the alliance player is camping his corpse - he is nowhere to be seen. Horde hits the res button and is IMMEDIATELY targeted by the same alliance player, who was hiding behind a hill. The alliance player couldn't be seen, and should not be able to see the horde guy.
---
How does he instantly target the hordie? Spy-addon. It tells the alliance player that the hordie is alive again, even though there was NO WAY for him to see that on his screen.
---
That addon is cancer.
---
ye
---
They used to allow stuff like this a loooooooong time ago, but now it gets you banned, don't touch stuff like that, even if it's harmless.
---
fucking
---
I get your point and it's well taken, but it's not what dev's are thinking. They are actively trying to integrate original dynamics to appeal retail to the larger classic base
---
Did I miss something or why is everyone just suddenly completely okay with cross faction chat through battle.net and the ingame option to right-click-add-to-friends for enemy faction players, as a normal human being I dont actually read any TOS, but wasnt this not allowed?
---
If someone whispers me through battle.net and i sense a stinky smell of orc or rotting corpses from his words I immediatelly block them. Its really a damn shame that you only see someone's battle-tag in friend request and not the character name.
---
&gt; Imagine respec for heal/dps twice a week for raids. You'll go bankrupt.
---
It's 7 gold per day, that's nothing.
---
Also i play on Ashkandi Alliance if anyone would like to play
---
The right side loot window is just a normal part of the interface isn't it? Drag it out, set to.loot channel only, background to black.
---
Spy gives you a notification about KoS players near you.

LBRS worg is the only pet with furious howl rank 4, other than that you're correct. The rare spawn in Duskwood USED to do shadow damage in earlier versions of the game but it's no longer a thing.
---
You will be surprised...
---
Thanks! That's me!
---
I do the same thing. I login to raid lead MC on Wednesday night and then you won't see me online for the remainder of the week. What's wrong with that? Many people in the guild do a whole variety of things during the other days, but after getting everyone ready to raid I don't want to get burnt out from the game and it will take a long time before we will see new content. Nobody in my guild is against this decision of mine.
---
poor priest, trying to smite you ... never had a chance
---
Good to see someone say it, looks fucking horrific!
---
You're not a very good troll.
---
How do you feel about all the guilds having really shitty names?
---
Theres still major difference between not being optimal and blizzard saying "You can't even use your abilities unless your playing our specific niche way"
---
That sounds really hopeful.  Could you expand on what you mean by catchup mechanics? Do those raids invalidate the gear from Tier 1, etc to allow people to jump in to later stuff?
---
I don't even think you can interact with the NPC to port you in if you're feared, nor would getting feared into BRD work...I'll be honest I"m at a complete loss as how this could have occurred unless it's a clone of that one glitch from WAY back in the day when on a super rare occasion multiple groups got put into the same raid instance.
---
It's a really nice server.  Very chill.
---
Amazing map, great job. I know from personal experience how much research and work goes into a piece like this.  
---
Has anyone in the comments pointed out yet that the Moonglade FPs are slightly incorrect? The FP in Nighthaven is *only* the free ride to Rut'theran / Thunder Bluff. The 'regular' FP in Moonglade is south-west of Lake Elune'ara. This is an incredibly small fault that I found after minutes of looking, and it's likely only important for my fellow druids. 10/10 map, keep up the good work!
---
And all people was raging about how layering is destroying game. But it seems most of the time there was 2 layers at most for whole month. Exluding big streamer servers ;) where was 3 max.
---
Regarding phases release date I am curious. This game is finished, most hardcore guild did mc/ony how many times, 4? 5? And they are already bored with content... if they release everything after 2-3 months what will you do when there is nothing more than naxx?
---
For me, let them leave and never come back. I am sick of gogogogogogo i want everything NOW mentality.
---
Thought he smelled a fish.
---
I was merely stating a fact, I am not wasting time on here instead of playing wow, I’m at work.
---
Huh.... after all this time I had no idea crit was shown if you hover over autoattack.
---
I guess nobody joins your groups.

I know this is somewhat off-topic, but I keep meaning to ask the question.  I know the benefits of different AS pets like Broken Tooth, but apart from AS are there other stats that differ between pets in classic?  IE if I tame King Bangalash, am I getting a stronger tiger than if I tamed one of the regular mobs?  Do any of them have unique skills/abilities?  I'm leveling a hunter alt and I'm about 20, starting to try to really understand hunter pets.
---
I got killed by 7 alli on the zep from UC to org. I didn’t release because I wanted to wait to get to org and run back to my body on the zeppelin. Little did I know that when you switch zones on a zeppelin you get rezzed. An alli priest loaded in faster than I do and they mind controlled me off the zep into the ocean ):
---
I'm only 49 on my.mage and I play... A lot.
---
Gonna put some friendly pushback by saying that for a lot of dungeons, and even into endgame dungeons does warriors can tank quite easily. Tanking in classic is not like retail at all, and I feel like even if everyone playing was an original vanilla player they might find it difficult to escape the live mindset of threat never being a problem and having to focus on a bunch of mob mechanics / super deadly mechanics. Most of the time, especially as a warrior, you should be able to work with your party to survive and honestly, why would we wait 30 minutes to finally get a tank when you can do the job well enough? Tricking you into tanking is toxic, but man, I get really peeved when I see enough warriors who unilaterally refuse to tank that it becomes a discernable pattern. I agree if you're asked to go off role that you can roll for both gear sets, it's only fair.
---
LEEEERRRRRRROOOOOYYYYY JENNNNNKINS!
---
I'd argue you can submit a ticket to ask them about any steps you can take. But aside from that, I'd assume they have an algorithm that monitors from where you login. It probably raises a red flag if one day you are on one end of the world and then on the other end the next day. They probably assume it's more likely that someone abroad stole your account than you going abroad and playing WoW on your holiday.
---
Hello sibling!
---
Ah really, interesting!
---
Will I be able to find a group for blackphantom villanity on alliance side? I dont think I have ever seen anyone run it but drops for priest look super solid until 40
---
all true, but sometimes guilds can be quite anal, like who takes improved might, improved wisdom or bok and other tiny things that ultimately don't matter for most content
---
but sometimes I just wanted to run around with ret/reckoning ;) which is a lot of fun!
---
My old guild was called "Oof"
---
Everytime someone joined they were greeted with "Oof"
---
When someone left the everyone said "Poof"
---
Hope you learned your lesson regarding pesky dwarfs
---
The island Telderassil is on existed before they planted a big tree of corruption on it.
---
Thank you
---
WC has a little iffy damage sometimes due to it all being magical. But otherwise you just let the DPS run amok and clear the dungeon in notime :P
---
You should roll greed. People will think you are lying and rolled Need to sell the item, unless they know your alt
---
nono,i mean the plate in the middle-right part of the screen.with metal-black background. Not chat window

I think the official lore answer is that the ocean is much bigger and that the map is not to scale in this regard

It's going to be really bad man. People don't understand.

I played private servers for years and I was last on Kronos 3. Kronos had a habit of adding their own quality of life features to the game, some worked out and some where huge busts.  One of the busts were they allowed you to que for a battlegrounds from anywhere in the world by a .join command. Sounded great in theory and most people were pretty hyped for it. Then the flight path camping began. Horde was the dominant faction and what they would do was go to a place like Morgan's vigle or refuge point and que for their BGs. They had long que times so they would literally execute everyone in this area. They completely annihilated any levelers as soon as they were worth honor. What happened was alliance players just quit playing or rerolled horde or on northdale. Only the truly dedicated stuck it out and the balance was even worse than before. It was a massive problem and had long lasting effects on the alliances population. Twinstar(the people who ran Kronos) eventually made it so that level 60s couldn't use the .join command which made it better but by that point the damage was already done. Alliance suffered from population issues the rest of the server because of this incident.
---
This will be the reality for anyone not level 60 when phase 2 hits. They will be camped at flight paths because it's the most efficient and steady honor. If your fraction is imbalanced you won't get help from your 60s because they also don't wanna get camped and waste their time vs fully PvP  speced and consumable carrying try hard pvpers.
---
Four loc'd out night elves going craaazy
---
Death Row is the guild that paaays me.
---
What's fucked is taking sub money for an MMO and delivering next to no multiplayer because there aren't enough players. Merge this early solves this issue rather than looking at merging around cata with 7 year old toons cus realms are dropping off.
---
Maybe your target was affected by some curse or spell that reduces healing received?
---
Ferals don't get their BIS weapon...they farm bags full of them because it's consumable.
---
Blizz will probably release the phases based on player progression. They will wait until a good amount of the playerbase reached the rag clear until they release the second phase. If the complaints about open world PvP grow too strong, they will probably preemtively release BG's.
---
Looks fine to me. 
---
You go first.
---
The real achievement here are those bag slots at level 40.
---
This is literally the gameplay of that warhammer mmo... kinda sad they fucked it up
---
?
---
+10% rep tho
---
Gotcha, tyvm for the info! I’ve heard Mara gives a pretty good bow too from a quest so will definitely have to check that out
---
It seems to me like Blizzard are still using some form of per zone shards, which is resulting in lag when there's a spike of player activity, since the shards probably only have enough resources to handle a zone under normal activity plus a little headroom. So when something like this happens the under powered shards just shit themselves.
---
The reason I think they're still using shards for zones is because I've seen weird lag spikes when going between zone borders, like if I'm on a FP going between searing gorge and burning steppes, there might be hitch when going across the zone border, like as if I'm being handed over to a different shard. Not only that but I've seen other players movement hitch for a second when going between zone borders.
---
hes saying a green pair of gloves with just + frost damage would be better then atal'ai with frozen wrath
---
revenge is only useful if the mob can be stunned (bosses cant). So it is a good talent for dungeons, but loses value in raids. The 2 points in taunt can be seen similar, however you will more often end up in a situation where you need taunt, and wished you had the 2 seconds less cd, than with revenge. In my opinion.
---
You’re reference a low pool of players, most who in all reality aren’t that good.
---
Save higher ranks for people you dislike
---
Did you forget that there was this little thing called name reservations?
---
 Hunters don't compete with all warrior gear. If you know what you're farming you can know what to take. I'm not going to take a rogue or warrior to farm Hand of Justice. I won't take a Warrior, Rogue or Hunter to farm Blackcrow. And I won't take a Hunter or Warrior to farm Deathdealer's. See the common thread? Virtually never a warrior.
---
They would rather people not have fun, than to upgrade their servers.
---
The only thing I can think is he accepted the teleport from the npc at the same time as getting feared, then just accepted a summon when he was inside
---
Huh, there's a guild called "it burns when I PVP" on Ashbringer EU also.
---
A few  FP's are missing some connections, it seems that the original map and many others online are based on some very early  vanilla sources, like beta or patch 1.1-1.3 or so. 
---
No way that Astranaar has only 1 connection to the north.   You can also go to Stonetalon and Azshara from Astranaar and maybe more. 
---
I will try to find a reliable 1.12 patch flightmap
---
I have seen a lot go for a smite/healing spec when they hit Blackrock dephts, especially if they want to be healing at 60 since there is quite a lot of good priest pre-raid bis from BRD. the smite spec allows for somewhat solo outside of BRD aswell.
---
Yeah this shit is fucking inexcusable.
---
I just did that tonight faking my way through a full brd quest run.
---
See my post above, I think they're using per zone shards.
---
*cries in shadow priest
---
I honestly just picture a warrior yelling VERY LOUDLY. Every time he demo shouts or battle shouts or taunts.
---
U FORGOT DISTURBED???!!!   
---
SACRILEGE!!!!!!!!
---
You don't have to, you could just stay holy.
---
They're for rogues to craft one of their DPS cooldowns
---
No! Besides doing their job, tanks work overtime as a first grade teacher on an excursion. I've pretty much tanked exclusively and the amount of shit you have to put up with people is just tiring. 
---
As a dps you're just another idiot pushing your three buttons while following the person that does the leading for you.
---
Stop boosting those assholes. And as a fellow holy pally i also do it in around 30 minutes except my friends are more gratefull. I do have a prot pally in mu guild that is really good at boosting and does it in 20 min though. Its more down to what gear you have and how big you can pull.
---
I wish to be in your guild.
---
You only need 20-25 to clear mc and onyx classic raids easy af
---
Not to mention there still only being MC. MC is like the raid I'm least stoked for. I want to go BRD+
---
They can't even begin summoning of you are not in the instance already...
---
Eh, a decent meleecleave group will be going too fast and taking too much dmg for healer to be dicking around like that. If tank dies, sure, but on regular pulls just save your mana for heals. 
---
Just drink heavily between pulls. Druid healers are fine for meleecleaves.
---
Reminds me of verycoolguy

Not to a 9 year old rager lol
---
I was questing in felwood. Killing some of the goat people. I (a human rogue) pass by a troll hunter who seems to need to kill them as well. I wave at him seeing if he’s friendly. He waves back. I go to pull a couple mobs, I have blade flurry up I should be okay. Suddenly his pet flies in behind me while I’m at half health and kills me. Okay frustrating but that’s a PvP server for ya. 
---
I go back and obviously make it my goal to kill him back. I throw on my crippling poison because good luck fighting me in your dead zone. I kill him...I may kill him a second time he comes back because I’m still irritated he griefed me. 
---
Then a bunch of alliance people rotate into the zone, me and a shadow priest group up start killing things. There’s also another duo of Mage’s. All four of us are standing in the center of the camps and the hunter respawns, stares at me for a moment surrounded by members of my faction and sends his pet on me. Needless to say he gets blown up almost instantly.
---
The saga doesn’t end there. Time passes I finish my quest and start running up the road through felwood. Who do I pass on the road? This hunter. Who dismounts throws his pet on me and I didn’t care to keep this fight going so I continue riding north.
---
I get to the alliance flightpath up north, vendor some stuff. Start heading to the timbermaw tunnel. THE HUNTER IS HERE. He chased me halfway up felwood. 
---
I killed him again, and left. Sometimes you should just let it go. 
---
—-sorry for crappy formatting, typing from my phone
---
Its only relevant at 60 tbh.
---
Were you the guy who joined guild, posted some cringy stuff, then posted even more cringe after getting gkicked?
---
Honestly don’t blame the GM there. Like if you’ve been in the guild a bit and drop that cool, but I’m gonna assume you’re someone who I don’t want in my guild if you lead with that
---
I think he added him on bnet and is pming that way
---
Show me where you can buy BoP dungeon gear for gold. I'll wait.
---
BoP items are not equivalent to a pile of gold because the conversion only goes one way. You can go item -&gt; gold, but there is no equivalent gold -&gt; item option.
---
As for why I should get priority on BoP gear, it's because if you don't give me priority then I'll start rolling on your BoP gear so I can vendor it too.
---
It's a simple prisoner's dilemma with repeated games. The best overall outcome comes when everyone cooperates. If you defect, I'll start defecting too, tit for tat. Now you are always worse off than if you had just cooperated. This is the incentive to cooperate.
---
yes. Is that not the standard way to play shaman? seems pretty natural.
---
It was a fake story, so he took it down.
---
Just think one second: Totally new, super noob player (Barely knows the basics, so I'd call him a first timer who doesnt even use wowhead etc). That total noob is lvl 32 is two weeks in, which I dont even believe, but lets say thats true.
---
Add to that, that this noob levels from 32 to 60, on his first character, as a super noob with no one to help him in less than two weeks. And he is already out tanking UBRS.
---
A true total noob is at best a clueless lvl 30 right now. He is not tanking UBRS 1 month after release. OP just fabricated a feel good story without thinking about the specifics, thats why its deleted.
---
Dude I forgot Bullet for my Valentine.
---
Its been a long time, but I just dug out my CD's from then and am currently listening to Ten Thousand Fists.

So jealous. Target let me order one on August 1st, then September 20th-ish the sent an email canceling it. I was livid!
---
Looks great!
---
Dude, I believe not even vanilla hat 50% max level characters.
---
But when does it start :(
---
football is so early 2000s. We in the future now!
---
This is what I thought before people started to talk about it being an emulation.
---
Read the first part of my post...
---
Im assuming he thought not only the fear would just run out but also he wouldn't be summoned that close, so he didn't think much of accepting the summon while feared
---
yes sorry, definitely ment blackfathom deeps
---
do ppl ever use lfg? I played on 2 servers, one with low pop and now on a high pop and on both the lfg channel looked kinda dead
---
This deserves more up votes.
---
Blazefury Medallion from Kazzak that scales with spell damage. It's stupid op and was only fixed in TBC. This neck alone makes cat druid viable in pvp.
---
&gt;  It's just nice to have a change of scenery with what you're farming, and I dunno if people are gonna be happy farming MC and Onyxia until 2020.
---
Yeah, I dislike the orange and brown of MC/Ony's Lair, bring on the orange and brown of BWL. 
---
It's the same scenery. People just want items that are actually good lol
---
Most people only log in to raid after 60. Not much too do classic content is easy
---
"I have a girlfriend, you don't know her, she lives in Canada"
---
You're asking why I would believe something that has no indication of existing doesn't exist.
---
I dont think so. From business perspective this is investition. And investing in Kingsblood has profit pretty low and long term - if noone sabotages it which is easy for low level mats. Investing same amount in better product (high level trade mats, limited supply stuff) would net you more profit or earlier. In volatile fresh economy you cant reset market easily.
---
Is it effective to dps in holy in raids? Don't know much about that. But it can aoe farm low dungeons with holy boom boom.
---
Settings -&gt; Sound -&gt; Uncheck Error Speech.
---
Esfand.
---
Anyways though, molten core is so laughably easy you barely need 40 players, let alone the correct specs. If your group is half decent a few people can go meme builds and be fine.
---
We are located on Zandalar Tribe EU, if you're interested. Amanih is our Guild Master.
---
There are pugs going you'll be fine
---
Wrong. Someone can be a dick without someone being entitled to a spot in the group.
---
And i wpl you have stacking -20 str+stam and some other mob casts -10% hit....
---
Did you just assume my class?
---
Lol this is me on smoulderweb... Love being a druid!
---
I got 5/8 as well and I'm 57
---
Zug zug!
---
Logs please.
---
Oh okay. And people were using layers to glitch and cheat, somehow?
---
But if the warrior that joins is 5 levels higher and way better geared than the current tank in the group it would only make sense (and he would end up tanking most fights anyway as he'd always get aggro). If he was still allowed to main need on dps gear, why make such a drama out of it? It would make for a way better and smoother run for everyone in the group including himself, that's just showing the average expected ret\*\*ed warrior mentality.
---
I thought I saw dual wielding as a buyable skill on my shaman, though. But if you're right I must be mistaken
---
I haven't really checked it that much, but this is something I saved from this subreddit that probably is useful

---
Otherwise I heavily recommend tradeskillmaster, scan the ah with it daily. Some items might also be worth hoarding on bank alts so you disenchant them later
---
Since no one really answered your question... it took me 33 minutes to solo it as a 49 hunter. 30 as a 60 hpal is fine
---
Maydie would be proud!
---
I was 20g off buying freezing band when some dude bought all ~8 for 400-500 gold and reposted 1-2 for 800. 5 days later freezing bands are 1399gold. Fuck this. :/
---
Man absolutely right but I’m not going to pass on BoE equipment.  If you follow need and greed system it’s perfect , if you need it you roll need if you wouldn’t mind it to sell greed. When you talk about specs and that greed is in case the person uses it for another spec then ok but just need what you need and greed if it’s for another spec
---
that doesn't answer the question in the slightest
---
&gt; non hybrid classes have it so easy they don't even realise the hassle of having to respec everytime you want to do some solo stuff or actually have some fun with your class
---
What do you mean? I play a hunter and I have to respec for raids.
---
Classic isn't retail, doesn't matter if you hit 60 in phase 1 or 6, you'll still be doing MC.
---
I joined a ZF group yesterday which had two warriors in it. Me, a druid, tanked.
---
(but it all went well)
---
Wait till Biggus Dickus hears of it
---
I'd probably just open a ticket saying you are only opening it to put on record that you are making this trip so that if they do decide to ban you, you'll have it on record saying this will happen.
---
It's a combination of customised Roth UI (for the orbs, art, unit frames), Bartender4 with Masque (for the action bars), and Neatplates with Roth theme (for the nameplates). 
---
In addition, the map is from Sexymaps, the top panel bar is Titanbar, and ElvUI handles little miscellaneous stuff like tooltips, fonts, buffs (skinned with Masque).
---
Sorry you didn't like it!

He has ashenvale, its the endpoint of his flight. Azshara connects most of northern kalimdor for alliance
---
The problem is, MC is not cutting edge raiding. Raiding only became hard with the release of BWL. MC was even for players back then relatively easy. And players today can pug this in 25-30 man groups without gear check.
---
Hush, neckbeard.
---
Highly recommend the Classic Addon Manager posted on this sub over the twitch app. One button press updates everything, simple import/export features and great dev support.
---
I just see the the "owo" pattern IF got on the top of its walls.

What should I open the files with? Every programme I try to view it with blurs all the detail as soon as I zoom in?
---
Can't believe mahnoman left
---
My spriest in almost pre raid bis is 3k hp, 5k mana and 250 spelldmg (most only in shadow tho). Still need burst of knowledge and jeds trinket.
---
When Ragnaros AoE knockbacks melees, he also reduces their threat, so perhaps they are above the OT in melee threat and get decimated before MT/OT gain aggro?
---
^This.
---
The warchief blessing is from a dungeon, you can 5man him easily.
---
&gt;Mana efficiency doesnt really help because of life tap.
---
It's the only reason why you would consider this set, -15% is amazing. The less gcds spend on tapping the more dps you do.
---
3 set bonus is also something which I used in pvp til Naxx but yea in raiding it's not useful.
---

That scene still gives me goosebumps :-(
---
Just take the file and upload it to an online poster/picture store.
---
It's not that expensive and since it's for personal use, copyright is not an issue.
---
The blizzard cloud is optimised for power efficiency and uses very low power and performance parts, it's the main reason sharding was invented, because they didn't want to have dedicated racks for each server with lots of performance unused.
---
To me it's very obviously an issue with their hardware, it simply doesn't have the boost clocks to be capable of this type of content. Because before this their whole design goal was the complete opposite of what this type of content needs.
---
I played a Rogue in Vanilla. We didnt expect our tanks to pay attention to everything, the melee DPS with them would point out certain things.
---
yes, most of them are BoP but doesn't require gnomish engineer to use so you can up engi to 260, craft them all and then relearn goblin
---
congrats, same spawn location I got mine yesterday in the early morning. Right as a gnome mage walked by too, bet he'd have killed it had I not been taming it.
---
More than you can afford, pal...a purple.
---
Shows exactly what kind of people play mages and priests :P
---
I never take hunters on instance runs when I'm the leader. I'm yet to meet one that knows how aggro works, doesn't pull shit by random, knows how to manage his pet and doesn't need on stuff is in reality useless to him. My party - my rules.
---
15 bucks a month is the price of a movie ticket and snacks. The points you have brought up are entirely subjective.

Meanwhile I've cleared MC 3 times and seen oe pair of Felheart Gloves which I am wearing.
---
Then what's the point of greed?
---
They also used this video for military intelligence basic officer leader course
---
Samse issue there, seems to me like a soft reset on aggro for a short time after knockback of rag, i taunt now every single knockback, and i only had one death of melees in our last kill
---
I dont wanna be that guy but maybe you should go back to retail and play LFR?
---
In my mind the list is simple:
---
* Revamp Azeroth again. Get rid of this Cataclysm state. It's been years, and it is really upsetting to act as if Deathwing just busted out five minutes ago.
---
* Return to the old gearing system. What does this mean? Essentially taking out these arbitary RNG tables and chests. Just give us drops from dungeons and raids, tokens from PVP to buy gear, and useful gear from crafting. No more Azherite gear, Artifacts etc.
---
* Don't make the expansion too bloated. I feel this was a problem with BfA. It intended to do so much (return to war lore, several new zones, loads of new races, azherite gear and so on). Just deliver a new land to explore with a straightforward story, with maybe a hint at something new (or old) at the end of it. Or not.
---
* Increase incentive for player interaction and cooperation. Perhaps through group quests with actually meaningful rewards (either really good gear or even mounts or something). Could make it so that you can grind for reputation through some cooperative content or such. Anything that makes the playerbase feel more connected would be fantastic.
---
Those are some thoughts of mine that I feel are much required at this point.
---
“Mmmmm” *whooptishhhh*
---
What’s the speed on your bow?
---
Humanoids over animals. All day. At least they drop weapons and other good vendor trash. (Depending on the actual job)
---
A dungeon run is only 100% a success when every boss is defeated and the gnome is dead.
---
You can get both
---
Rogue, trade people flavor items from pick pocketing
---
Honestly yours is better. They are concerned. Yours is concerned with a hint of hidden trauma. Your dude should be whispering "the horror! The horror!"
---
&gt; Blink will put you on the ground even if you're in the air as long as you're sufficiently close to the ground.
---
Not quite, it will put you on the ground even if you're high up in the air. The reason it can fail is if you're like jumping from a mountain because it will probably make the calculation based on some part of the slope.
---
Hell a lot of gear sucks. There is exactly one healer weapon that is decent in MC and it is only marginally better than the one I got from BRD.
---
I’m on Mankrik and part of the guild &lt;Hydra&gt;. When new people join the guild there’s typically at least 5 guildees who type various welcomes like:
---
“Hail Hydra!”
---
“HH”
---
“HFH!”(hail fucking hydra)
---
And other variants. We also say it to each other when we’re out and about; waiting for a zeppelin, in Org, etc. I love the personality of our guild. We also have the real Mankrik in our guild so that’s pretty cool too.
---
I just hit 40 and got my ravager. Currently Arms. How do I get from here to there?
---
Could say that about any add on
---
I’m trying to get my wife into it so I can play more. 😈 the old “it’s something we can do together” trick
---
Single digit is still as many as 9. That's "many more" than 2 or 3.
---
You are thinking about unsubbing for 6 months because you cant reach 60 in 4 months and chose a PvP realm?
---
This is why waiting for casuals with the content release is NEVER viable. Most of the people posting here "im only 30 lol" will never even reach 60. 
---
Delaying the phases forever just fucks the game for the people who are actually interested in playing the game.
---
Thanks for that idea, so you mean a temporary (or permanent?) threat reduction after knockback (no matter if resisted or not)?
---
*laughs in warrior*
---
The first 10 levels we can't dual wield, nor use swords or maces. The class is built on dual wield so not having it is bad for everything. Then, it's also made around poisons being up. Don't get those until 20, realistically 23 if you're solo, since you have to kill a 24 elite goblin. At level 30 you get blade flurry if you went combat. This is great for your DPS and by then you've got stealth rank 2, vanish, probably riposte, Sprint, and evasion. At level 34 you get blind, which is the last piece of your basic arsenal, you can finally actually play the class.
---
After that, with the exception of safe fall, you just get more damage and speed. Might be missing something, but that's the gist of it.
---
Makes sense
---
&gt;Nah that’s sad
---
Nah, that's wpvp
---
85???
---
Too much???
---
Wild
---
they are added in classic
---
My friend and I have 1 goal and that's to be 60 in at least half raid gear by the time phase 2 comes out because once that happens,the world will become a much more dangerous place.   
---
50-60 zones are going to be swarming with people doing pvp. I'tll be all about those HKs
---
The map is high-res enough to be printed out and framed. I definitely plan to do that in the future.
---
And not a transmog in sight 😃
---
There's a bunch of pieces that have hit/crit though. It's not an amazing set by any means but it isn't terrible.
---
Lock pick.
---
Yeah but you don't get the suits of the cards. why not just play a round of yahtzee instead?
---
But can't I teach any wolf furious howl rank 4 once I learn the ability?
---
Im guessing that based on activity and desire for pvp ranks there will be plenty of wpvp besides just pking.
---
My prediction is that certain hotspots are gonna have wpvp like youve never seen and theres gonna be a lot of city raids. 
---
Im actually really excited for the in between stage before it becomes organized. It exemplifies one of the main reasons were here honestly. Activity out in the world.
---
It says greed right on the roll window, why are you greeding?
---
Good thinking! Sitting at 750g.. saving for my mount so seems risky haha
---
It could but I believe you can't summon someone inside the raid until that person is actually inside so even if he got feared outside just as he ran in, it would still take \~3-5 seconds until he actually got the summon. At the end he says himself "I was feared for some reason" as if he was surprised himself that he was feared.
---
I should definitely start joining random guilds in my alts and trolling reslly hard
---
Hey ty for fast reply. Is there a nice spot I can chill at somewhere in between 35-40
---
Killing lowbies and flightmasters isn't though.
---
As a vanilla 19 twink I salute you sir.
---
yep it's obvious they are still using sharding, although there is only 1 shard per defined area. This is often visible when something unusual happens and you're at the border between 2 of those zones, you'll see disappearing resource nodes, disappearing or appearing mobs , walk a little back and see them appearing / disappearing again.
---
All those "in the matrix" moments just shows that your character is being moved from one shard to a neighbor one
---
Read his reply...
---
Everything that a holy Pala also brings, but they can also heal pretty damn well on top of it.
---
ya they just wanna justify their selfish behaviour they have no reason to actually believe it works that way other then personal convenience. realy shows
---
I always laugh when I see this. Entitled hunters thinking they have some sort of leverage.
---
It always seems to be Eastern European countries in these stories. I suspect Blizzard treat Eastern European logins on US accounts as automatically bad. Really makes you think 🤔
---
Your a warrior, go tank SM till 40 and move on to other areas.. 30-40 is always gonna be a shitshow both sides. Just gotta shimmy around it..
---
It’s always elvui :D
---
downvote for killing dwarf ladies. you brutal and evil
---
The complaint wasn't about numbers though. The complaint was that some people were abusing the layer swap to farm or avoid conflicts.
---
Blizzard did ban some of those people, where the boss abuse occurred. I don't think its as a big of a deal as people made out. However I can still understand the initial complaints.
---
I don't really understand what you are saying.
---
I get it that you're using an autoshot timer. I've had one for a little time, it was pushing a white cooldown bar to the sides of the frame and then there was a red bar rapidly going back to the center, where I would should.
---
Because I understand that each autoshot has a 0.5s window cast time or something, which is probably the red bar in the addon.
---
I think you're saying that you can use aimed shot before the animation of the autoshot plays, to which I agree. I used to do this on private servers, and you'd kind of start casting aimed and then shoot an autoshot.
---
The problem I'm having in classic is that the animation may bug and you'll just sit there with your arrow drawn, while the damage keeps showing on the mob. You have to move a little to reset the animation.
---
I've since turned off my autoshot addon, I really don't like having to watch that bar instead of the mob I'm fighting.
---
With enough practice, you can learn your attack timers and start aimed shot just before your next autoshot goes off. Don't forget that arrows/bullets have a travel speed as well!
---
You can pretty much communicate everything you need with pings in LoL. Chat is not needed at all.
---
Also kalimdor was only discovered in WC3 iirc
---
What are you talking about? You rank up at the same speed with or without bags, rank14 is 12 weeks minimum
---
Well, that's APES, not a random noname pleb tank who saw someone monetize the tanking services :D
---
Apparently not though, considering a large portion of the "Give us Vanilla realms Blizzard" crowd was pointing at Private servers having thousands of players on them and that it was clear people wanted to play Classic. I have no idea honestly what those people were doing day to day but apparently people want to do it!
---
You can consider yourself super lucky that the other hunter didn't just murder Broken Tooth, or screw up your tame so you'dd die to the mobs and then tame it himself.
---
And dont you forget it :)
---
&gt;Are you serious?  Do you know how many times i've died on my warrior leveling?  
---
&gt;It is not fast, and if you consider auto attacking, heroic/mortal strike "active gameplay" then i'm Oprah.
---
Yeah but I think the biggest problem will be players trying to lvl 50-60 in p2. It will become a pain with people farming honor without bg:s.
---
Warrior AoE taunt is also only every 10 minutes.
---
One advantage druids have over warriors is the ability Swipe.
---
Swipe makes it much easier to hold multiple enemies and warriors don't have anything that fills that same niche.
---
Uhmm, why would you?
---
The robes are one of the only ones you can get with +hit in this phase, despite having pretty bad damage overall. The gloves have crit as well as 9 damage, which is pretty damn good for dropping off the first boss. Crit BTW is worth about 14 spell damage, so slightly less dmg overall than Gloves of Power for a ton of raw stats.
---
Whats HoJ?
---
I’m educating in cloud infrastructure to become solution architect currently and it is basically how any cloud would run I would imagine. Moving from dedicated hardware to cloud will affect how things are working indeed but I wouldn’t blame infrastructure here in particular. To me it looks like a complex problem with several weak points which works fine separately but brought in together fail to achieve the required level of service. I don’t have any proofs whatsoever, just some experience, education and gut feeling
---
My guild is hitting raids this weekend and as a level 56 i am one of the slower levelers... I love this situation
---
No,
---
If there are 5 players then all 5 players receive data from the other 4 players. 5*4 = 20 ~ 5^2
---
5! is 120
---
300 confirmed kills?
---
Not to mention that even people who have trouble gearing up won't be as long as they have the money. My guild will soon offer BRS buy runs, where you pay for the items you want. And a lot of us also plan to get alts up that can then offer MC runs. 
---
Guild leadership does not want us to offer MC runs on our mains, because they say there is so much gear we need from MC that we will not be geared out by the time Phase 3 hits.
---
Ganking lower levels will negatively affect your honour score so will prob see fewer high level players Ganking in stv
---
wait, battle shout does aggro?  
---
Man, so that\`s why my tanks sucked ass.  
---
Also as a tank, is it better to sunder or heroic (asking specifically for lower level dungeons such as dm and stockades)
---
Fun fact: The classic/vanilla leveling experience was all over the place. You were expected to be constantly killing things when questing and in between quests. Then when you reach the point that you have, a lot of time is spent traveling between zones. Since you brought it up in the P.S., mob drops were not really all that common. Classic/vanilla is nothing like retail in that retail *figuratively* holds your hand and gives you everything for basically free.
---
the yeti cave in hillsbrad was packed with people all fighting for the mobs and the horrible drop rate of the quest item. good thing people did not know that the snow yetis further up north drop the item too. after that I left that place because to many allies there ganking
---
You know, if you blink just before hitting the ground you'll reset your fall damage? In other words take none.
---
Mages are just too good of a class
---
A 60 making 30 minutes of his time available for some unappreciative shits is indeed a long time
---
Lets not forget the plate repair bill too that nobody helps you with.
---
Why is that?
---
For the luls I guess. I get a kick out of salty people. Especially when it's over something so trivial.
---
Thank you. Is there some resistances that are never used or should be prioritized over others?
---
&gt; This was when people were complaining about queues after the first week or so.
---
Did you forget how to read?
---
Le sex and le drug number. Epic. X)
---
The trick is to toggle it on and off between mainhand swings. While being queued your offhand acts like yellow hits so it doesn't suffer the hit penalty. More forgiving in raids where rage becomes less of an issue.
---
And I get everything to myself because I’m on Hawaiian time. Very rarely many people on past 8-9 my time.
---
Isnt that the “real” vanilla experience 🤔
---
You didn't use the secret handshake.
---
Professions are also a good way of making money. Everyone has Skinning so leather is cheap. when the price is right in the AH, you can get mats craft an item and sell it to a vendor for profit. I had 160g at level 36.
---
just fuck me up now
---
Make that 80%
---
Its a great site, but Im looking for more of an overview of how to prioritize stats.
---
It’s already working.
---
There's an any class FP in Moonglade that's not mentioned.

---
even though you resist you still get the aggro loss, just taunt after knockback/resist and all should be fine.
---
Whats a good mob to grind on around lvl 53-55?
---
It's not really a problem of specc. Fury is the best for tanking too.
---
If I train a new pet, how long until it level up? I imagine it will take some time bringing a level 50 up to speed?
---
I got mind controlled in STV's troll temple where you are supposed to collect tablets, after that they tried to steer me into pack of mobs.
---
Long loading screens could account for a lot of these things, doesn’t know he’s fears when he loads in. Summon starts while he’s still loading and he accepts it as soon as he’s in without ever noticing the fear. Is the video English? I didn’t watch much if it cause I couldn’t understand the people talking
---
Shit, this is why I switched to pvp lol to each their own!
---
casuals will cry when phase2 is out but no BGs
---
Flightpaths will be camped and all lvl 55+ zones will be full on pvp.
---
I really dont think blizzard has thought this through :D
---
In a guild called "Knights who still say Ni"
---
Every now and again we all spam Ni! In G chat.
---
It’s not that you are automatically a good DD just because you rolled a Warr or Rogue. In a Casual Guild you can shine as a ret that is always prepared. I’ve seen plenty people that are supposed to do well on the Damage Meter failing to spriests and get palllys just because they suck.
---
Your general opinion on this just doesn’t apply anymore. Welcome to 2019 where people can make a lot more viable than 15 years ago. Let them prove it before you falsely accuse them what seemed to be true 15 years ago.
---
Lol if you cede your stake on a 500g item, you are essentially giving that player 500g of utility. The person who class fits is not entitled to the item. It provides them 500g of utility, as it would anybody in the party. They have no higher claim to need than anyone else in the party.
---
Do you understand what that page is showing?
---
I wish the tanks I get would use sunder armor at all.
---
battle shout generates aggro for every player you buff and that threat is divided upon all enemies you are in combat with. At 3-4 enemies it generates more threat than demo shout.
---
It also generates threat on that one pesky range mob who refuses to get kited and attacks your healer. It's so easy to kite range mobs like that. You just battle shout once or twice then go out of line of sight and the range mobs runs to you. Obviously won't work if your healer already threw out some big heals but it's a good initial threat generation
---
You can even get the staff that conjures food for you and give him that.
---
Calm down, my guy. It's just a game.
---
It only ever worked for what it was intended to do, cutting costs, everything is secondary to that metric.
---
Players have been complaining about sharding since day one.
---
Here's an interesting read for you.

I play on a medium /medium-low pop realm and it's bustling with activity. /Join lookingforgroup
---
It's a tightrope act, but when it works it's incredible.  During Cataclysm, my ex wife and I owned the gem market on Area 52 (which was a fairly huge server).  Gem prices were absolutely ridiculous at a time when everyone needed tons (during Dragon Soul) because we were able to maintain our buyout lock for months.  The amount coming in was so far in excess of what we had to spend to buy up every undercut that was posted.  
---
In the end, she used her share of the gold to buy every mount and companion pet that existed (aside from ones you can't get with gold like CE ones).  I saved my gold and bought years of game time tokens and still have a small fortune despite not playing the market for the last few expansions.  
---
So really, if this person is adequately prepared to keep up with the buyout, then they can make a fortune.  If not, they're going to lose their shirt.
---
You don't need the best dps for dungs holy shit.
---
Suge what?
---
Seemingly true in every military. You use **only** Internet Explorer in the IDF as well, if you want to actually be able to work.
---
Right? Salt this good is gold!
---
Every class is worth playing!
---
^(Well except Paladin of course.)
---
Got a similar guild on Pyrewood, called 'Wiped on Trash'. They're actually a nice bunch whenever I've grouped with them!
---
Nah I really doubt that. They just have a confused moral constitution that is somehow deeply connected to the "Need" Greed" buttons, thinking that standard BoP dungeoning etiquette applies to BoE epics in pugs.
---
No, you can't play as Alliance with a Horde... Wel, you can kill mobs together, but not group up or share Quests
---
Got suspension from doing this back in wotlk
---
Loading this map killed my poor laptop rip
---
my story yesterday in Blasted Lands: just killing dem boars, when ra dom dwarf runs past me at 20% hp with 2 mob.  i was like its nice red beard. one mob reseted, then i taunted the other one (it was not even tagged and would give me q item so why not). kill it, dearf pops bandage on homself at 10% hp. and in tht exact moment the undead rogue pops out and Baaaaang. :/
---
Its not so bad, you sit in frost nova only when you are not sheeped
---
Unless you know everything by heart, you're going to have to grind. If you use a guide that shows you were the quests are and do everyone dungeon at least once with all its quests, you should almost never have to grind.
---
What about the other 99%
---
I'm assuming this might be it, but I've never considered the fact that Food/Water-as-a-Service might be a very viable, and lucrative, busineds ingame
---
&gt; They aren’t saying they are expecting to top the charts but are asking if it is viable.
---
And they objectively aren't.
---
&gt;  if someone doesn’t take you because you’re a certain spec (and perform well in that spec) 
---
Yet, no one has managed to show me a well performing paladin.
---
&gt; then they’re likely to not clear the place anyways
---
Can you stop acting like playing ret wont be dragging down 39 other people?
---
also, when you're not happy with the condition a group sets up, just leave, OP.
---
This is not a wedding, this is not a job, if at any time you're in a group doing things you dont like or dont want to do, you can always just leave.
---
I do this all the time, if I'm not satisfied with how things are going, after some tries to turn it back into the direction I want, I just leave and find another group, nothing wrong with that.
---
Like yesterday I was invited to tank for ZF, as lv48 war, I still said yes because I knew the healer.
---
From the start, people are laggin behind, don't follow, and basically expect to be carried. Body pulls are legion, etc.
---
After a couple wipe, I state that now we"re going to refocus, play well and be done with this fast and proper.
---
Next pull, some body pulling of adjacent  packs happens again, we almost make it but wipe again, I say nothing.
---
3rd corpse run in 30 minutes, ok... Get back to it, all rez, run back to where we were, but no mister hunter is apparently afk, without warning, and just stays at the entrance.
---
I propose we kick him and find a mage instead, feral druid says no, and then whispers to the hunter about it, who then complains to me, saying " so you wanted to kick me, boy ?"
---
I didn't even reply. Next pull again goes horribly wrong, I just leave and put hunter and druid on ignore, end of story.
---
5 minutes later I'm in maraudon with another group, and we rocked the entire instance, the 3 branches, without a single wipe, nobody tried to ninja, nobody body-pulled mobs, paladin healer was outstanding, we all thanked each other, added every one to friend's list and almost did a second run but decided it was really getting late.
---
Don't let other players ruin your gaming time, it's YOUR gaming time, you do with it as you will.
---
mate!!!!!!! I FKIN LOVE YOU!!! I didnt even think of this idea! 
---
Will be looking into this asap, and getting it set up! Thank you! :D
---
Yeah. 
---
My friend, who is hardcore Horde lover (he isn't hating Alliance tho!) said we should play WoW on other server on Alliance side, bcs his old guild was forming again. I was so excited to play Night Elf, again. Gosh. But we never had time to do it. 🤷🏻‍♀️😥 Anyway, my point is - hate for another fiction's players is not the good way. Hate for a certain character, who did something - that's the way. But not for the whole faction or actual players, that's ridiculous.
---
5k Would be an epic mount? I believe our countries have different assumptions on what a great horse is. My local riding stable regularily sells horses for above 25,000€ and there is a breeder a few kilometers away from me who's horses usually sell between 70,000-120,000€
---
For 5k you would not even get the seed of a good horse, these go for 10k.
---
YOU NOOB?
---
When BGs drop
---
You are not garbage, u just do it in your pace.. me and my friends are also former wow players so we knew kinda where to go and stuff. If youre brand new it can take some longer time ofc
---
Heartseeker could use some more Horde and definitely Mage, it's most definitely not the most overplayed class at all.
---
Uhhh maybe for PVP, but you sorely lack any sort of damage or hit stats for threat or damage of any kind.  It's definitely significantly better for Resto that it is for any Feral spec.
---
The Marsh Inkspewers in SoS and the Owlbeasts in Winterspring want to have a word with you.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Princess is a little trickier, but definitely not impossible. You need to led Shadow Word: Pain do most of the work and kite around the outside of the circle for quite a while. 
---
The only times she'll really be hitting you is when she chucks a boulder at you. If you have DBM (Deadly Boss Mods), you'll know when this is coming and will be able to shield yourself in time. She usually follows up shortly after with her AoE fart move. This is when you get the distance back, and if you have time before she starts moving again, only then do you cast anything (Heal, Mind Blast etc.).
---
Keep yourself healthy with Renew and Vampiric Embrace only when you need the healing, re-apply SW:P as soon as it ticks off, preemptively use PW:S as she's about to knock you down and make sure you keep Inner Fire up on yourself at all times. Keep kiting in large circles and once she drops below 8k\~ish HP, she moves significantly slower so you can cast Mind Blasts into her a little bit more.
---
its fun like once every 30min

Yes it is.

SURE BRO LOL. Proving my comment right about huntards. Class full of clueless dickheads.

Agreed. Does lose that rpg feel

Don't need the best tanks either.

Depends on the Humanoid really. A typical humanoid I kill has 5 Silver worth of coin. Typical BRD mob has 10-20 silver worth of coin. Not to mention other items they have in posession.

Theres no pvp tricket that removes fear om pretty sure :-)

I dislike how folks forgot what literally means. Might as well make irregardless a word while you're at it, seeing as folks don't know what regardless means.

I've been doing a bit of AH shenanigans lately, mostly with thorium. I've noticed I can get 20 ore for about 8g and sell the bars for 10 to 11.5
---
This became extra apparent when someone tried to do the same thing as this kingsblood boy and started to corner the price on bars by controlling the entire stock... except he left ores alone.
---
I made 30g profit in the last couple nights just buying cheap ores and selling my bars for 11g, while he is trying to sell for 12. I've also been buying bars for 9/stack and reselling. It's been a pretty easy way to profit when you get a bit of an understanding for the AH.
---
Of course. Everyone needs BoE because it's worth tons of gold. I don't deserve it anymore or less than you do.

My wild guess would be broken isles

Aesthetically they’re the most ‘edgy’ race. Plus if you don’t really dig the ‘tribal’ style of the other horde races, they are the most unique pre-blood elves.

Agreed on food, but not sure about water. Even for RP matters, it's not harmful or anything. But selling specific food for people does sound fun !

if you are horde.....and as druid....I can only suggest you go to shadowpray village and grind on the mobs as you farm the shellfish nets off the coast. There is a repeatable quest from the guy on the pier called "fish in a bucket" for 5x shellfish turn in, which gets you 55 silver per turn in. 1 hour farming here, will get you 12-15g easily. Also the mobs are level 33-35, so good xp to grind on to, so not wasted time leveling. 
---
I basically did this from level 35-40 (no more than 1 hour a day early morning or late at night when it was empty), and went from about 40g to 140g. Gained a level or two grinding the mobs too. Dont get me wrong, its pretty boring, but will 100% get you your mount as soon as you ding 40! 
---
Good luck.
---
That's because the real winners are the poison cleansing totem. And if you go resto. Mana tide totem.
---
Then no. You could be a druid and your bis until AQ40 is manual crowd pummeler. Go for bis or pre-bis.
---
This is an astonishing amount of work!  
---
And at the same time a damn good one too!!!  Insane result, I hope you are proud, because you made Azeroth proud!
---
Yeah so I've done everything that isn't STV and i'm only 42. And rfd only gives like 17k / 35 min per run, so needing to run that 9 times to get a level sounds...awful
---
Just started getting into streamers and stuff, mostly just watching old clips/highlights of them on YouTube.
---
I knew "everyone hated" Asmond but watched some of his stuff anyway. I must say, I don't get it. Was there some specific event that caused the hate? Because I found him no more or less annoying than any of the others.
---
Learned this the hard way with Dream Dust. Lost about a hundred gold before I bailed. If you think you have enough capital it means you probably need more.
---
Except warriors totally destroy rogues. Maybe it will be better over level 40 once you have plate
---
Anything in Felwood or Ungoro.
---
That's fair, particularly for things like jewelry or weapons where you're not giving up armor by taking the dps piece. 
---
And like I said, I don't want to stop them from rolling, I just like to know who's going to be rolling. Let's me temper my expectations a bit :)
---
Btw in retail, mythic raiding works the same way as the old ID system, one lockout per character (with the disclaimer)
---
The horde flight path in felwood is way off. Should be a lot more north west by the river.
---
yes, if there's no AH listings at the time. :) otherwise if I advertise in chat I'm always below the lowest AH price, but it saves me the AH cut, deposits, and time selling
---
it's not the ping that matters, though. It's the time for the server to treat your data. Ping means nothing if the server takes 500ms to register your corpse looting, for exemple, or 500ms to register your use of a trinket.
---
Reputation i feel is less of a factor in this modern version of classic. I've had to leave groups before for real life reasons, and every time i leave theres a guy who claims his entire guild 'know' about me now and won't interact with me.
---
2days later I'm selling recipes to their guildies.
---
I don't know if its because of the larger cultural shift, or if people are just more fickle these days and less loyal/more self orientated, but reputation  i've noticed is considerably less ingrained in the community.
---
yeah, then why didn't you farm instead of begging and spamming chat?
---
Who.
---
Yes you should be able.
---
Also weirdly enough at 39 I ran it solo for a warlock friend and it only took like a hour and some change.
---
you know if you're not working a known bug, this game is very hard to jank and punishes you quite severely.
---
good work
---
It rly is in PvE :) But amazing in PvP!
---
I'm specced holy
---
55 silver is the quest reward or you have to vendor/AH the shellfish?  I know I did the quest so I can finish catch of the day but I dont remember the reward
---
Saddest post on the subreddit :(
---
Because undead is the choice of men
---
wasn't aware of this. This could explain it
---
This might be in response to single layer servers? Maybe I'm overthinking it but the supply should drop a lot if the server is limited to one layer, right?
---
About the gear:
---
Seems like most of the members had at least a few pieces of their BiS, if not most of it.
---
The maintank seems really stacked, having T1 and T2 gear, Eskhandar's Claw with Crusader etc.
---
So it's a mix between people who hasn't stepped foot in MC yet together with some people who cleared it multiple times most likely
---
Not 100% sure on this but...
---
#showtooltip has to be the first line
---
The execute along with the others wont work. The macro wont fall through to the next line if the first ability doesnt work.
---
Raging blow isnt in classic.
---
Fairbanks server zug zug guild member checking in!
---
World of WAAAAAAAAGH!craft
---
I think it's way better to prioritize the more casual player base who can't play 40 hours a week instead of focusing on a few guilds that playing as if they are racing against a clock.. btw this is what blizzard want's, now they hope that those bored players will swap to retail until phase 3.
---
I've been playing since classic released and just hit lvl 37 last night..
---
Just the general hate that people throw at people who are smart but egocentric and use their intelligence to manipulate their thousands of viewers and have become an unstoppable deathball of greed in the game by mostly standing on the shoulders of their fans.
---
He most definitely is tanking. Same as if shadow priest joins the group he's healing. Or a feral druid joins as dps he is either tanking or healing. Unless you are a pure dps class you will have to play more roles then dps, thats how Vanilla wow works.
---
The worst group i had was with a paladin who refused to heal when we overpulled and i was oom as a healer, becous he was 'a ret paladin'...
---
Disabled it and it's working now, thank you
---
but, theres people out there :o
---
Lately one of his guild members ninja looted quite stupidly and people got very uspet, quite a few misleading posts about asmongold apparently supporting the behaviour were posted later that were incredibly out of context, many redditors would have taken it at face value.
---
The situtation was resolved quite humorously however a lot of people were unhappy with how it was resolved because the ninja was not kicked. The vast majority of people do not hate asmongold, however there is a significant number of people who post rather stupid messages in his chat and then get banned - the type of people to go on reddit and then make posts about him.
---
Pretty boring stuff I only wrote this out because I am on a very long classic wow flight path atm.
---
Only low lvl npc kills are dishonorable kills, players just give zero honor when grey
---
I got it for 40g 2 weeks ago to replace my WW axe and it gave me such a big boost as a warrior. Gatorbite Axe is a good alternative, from Maraudon. The Uldaman mace and sword are also very good, but I didn’t see either drop and I prefer axe spec.
---
You should have a raid ID for any raid instance you enter, but only be locked if a boss is down.
---
Not sure about your macro functioning, but #showtooltip is basically how you choose a picture for your macro (aside from the ones you can choose from while naming the macro)
---
#showtooltip Overpower
---
would make the action button use the same icon photo as overpower, for example.  If you're choosing your own icon from the list then you don't need that line.
---
Wish I was a class who got fed gear lol, we have a shaman who has 6 piece and his bis weapon. Same shit, classes like shaman, warlock and Druid get geared fast.
---
Oh wow, that's a bit of a downer. 
---
Surprised they didn't follow private servers in having honorable kills in from the beginning, they've already followed them in starting from 1.12.
---
What's some decent gear that a level 40 Druid so go after?  I'm feral for solo leveling but I love healing.. except I spend most of my time tanking for groups.  I also love crit chance in cat form.
---
Probably wanna focus on agi/str with some int/healing until I hit 60 and then I can look to carry around 2 sets of gear.
---
Brilliant work OP, the map is so detailed and so big that it takes as much time to load on my office PC than downloading porn pics 15 years ago ! This will be much helpful.
---
Where is pandaria???
---
It’s 55 silver per 5 shellfish you hand in and it’s repeatable. As a Druid you’ll move between pots so fast, so can stack up 20 per stack and will easily get 5-6 stacks per hour if you are there alone. So easily 12g an hour. You also get vendor crap and the odd green out of the traps. Also a Chance on the Big iron fishing pole, which normally sells for 1g on the AH.
---
Confirmation bias or not. But I tried the drop quest and pick back up strat from wowhead. Farmed for like an hour with no luck. Tried this and got it second kill.
---
&gt; My guild is full of professional and successful people who make good money.
---
i make big monies working at  the business factory.
---
No abuse was done. I don’t want my account banned for a year tbh.
---
alright, so where's the proof?
---
You know, STV raptors drops strange boe greens, epics etc. Or it's just my luck.
---
Sorry, for some reason I never think of hunters as a raiding class, don’t know why so please don’t take offense. Back in the day in our guild we had maybe a couple of hunters but they were alts iirc.
---
very close \^\^
---
ZF is easy. Uldaman is a bit annoying because the last bit is often much higher level than the tank. People try to tank Uldaman at levels 43-ish, but the mobs go up to like 46-47 in the end.
---
Dont get me wrong I love tanking, but its a task that requires a moderate amount of concentration and since you set the pace for 4 others in your group its best to have your head in the game, but sometimes im to tired or busy on discord or anything else and I just want to go in automatic dps mode for a run can you blame me?
---
I play on a PvP realm. this set is amazing for PvP :)
---
are you guys just playing non-stop since launch wtf
---
Thats wrong tho. The times when 1 realm = 1 server are long. Nowadays you have server clusters. You could have 50 layers with 2000 players each on the same realm and it would work fine for the most part. The problem is having too many people in the same place at the same time. Since every player gets updates from every other player in close proximity
---
So I've been testing it quite a bit more.
---
i found out the epic dagger from princess can crit. It proc'd for 112 instead of 100 earlier for me. 
---
 i'm trying to document everything w/ that dagger since I got it from princess a week ago and there isn't a ton of information about it online. It doesn't scale w/ SP though.
---
It did end up proccing twice in like one second too once. I'm not 100% sure what proc'd it twice quickly because I had three DoTs on the enemy but as far as I'm aware it can't proc from dot ticks. Well I was drain lifting at the time and I think drain life made it proc twice. So I'm thinking it MAY proc off channeled ticks. Will update you more.
---
Ravager is BiS for Warrior AoE fight even at 60 so your point is invalid
---
No there isn’t.
---
on my PvE set : p
---
I think an organized attack would have the same outcome no matter who the attacker is, eighter horde or alliance. 
---
Battleground on the other hand would atleast on even starting both beeing organized more or less, depending if people que with premade or not, but atleast both sides know what to expect.
---
What do you mean 31/5/15?
---
You mean specing elemental?
---
We are little over a month from launch, having a level 60 by now most likely means an average of 3-5 hours played a DAY since then. I would hardly call that casual.
---
That much defense should give about 1% dodge and 2% less chance to be crit/crushed. Defense is not bad.
---
Does this guy exclusively crit? Lol
---
Haha why hate him lol he's doing well and the drama is hilarious too watch
---
yaaaaaay go shoot some guys!!
---
What about mages then?
---
I'm a member of both but on my realm at least LookingForGroup as much more widely used and it's my default if I'm LFM.
---
Could be gold transfer from horde to ally
---
That would be a gold buyer* not seller
---
I've played on RP severs forever, enjoying the atmosphere and the odd light rp when i can get a giggle. I just can't see RP lasting long on classic :(
---
thanks. I often also mistype laugh and love, thinking phonetically.
---
Pretty easy way to fix this "LF1M MAGE"
---
Amen bruv
---
I never understood what layering was and how it worked. At this point, I'm too afraid to ask..
---
okay, I dont even have berserker stance yet so raging blow was just from what I copied  
---
but I'm not sure it won't go to the next attempt to cast if the first one isn't possible; this one has been working:  
---
    #showtooltip Charge
---
    /cast Charge
---
    /cast Rend
---
    /startattack
---
Shaman for sure.  Theyve seemed rare from 20-40 but also the ones that do exist are killing the game. Top dos charts and can self heal/rez.  Very good at solo and dungeons and can play multiple roles
---
Have 2 account or do as we did back in the Day boost for boost
---
That could be payment for a interfaction bounty. Seems fishy tho
---
Imagine being camped. \*Laughs in rogue\*
---
Only 29 here.  But that's only because I rerolled on a diff server leaving behind a lvl30 toon.  I'd prolly be in the low 40's by now if I didn't reroll.
---
Sign me up. But as a priest with no jaw. Some water would really help me get the bread down
---
the point of battle shout is that you buff everyone. If you only buff yourself the threat that you generate is only 1/5 of what it could be.
---
(I'm by no means an expert at making gold, but I guess I've managed to err on the side of profit enough to be comfortable.)
---
Not having to pay for a mount helped. Otherwise most of my gold comes from selling Engineering products (profits of which have surpassed double the leveling cost by now at 282 Engineering), selling limited/out of the way vendor recipes on the AH for 100%-400% markup (buying recipes whenever I pass by Booty Bay or Vendortrons), and buying some Horde-common/Alliance-rare items off the Neutral AH and reselling them to the Alliance.
---
More nefariously, I also passively acquire cheap bargains skimmed off the top of the auction house over the week, stocks of which I then resell on the AH during the weekend. These markets have to be relatively low saturation but high demand so I can temporarily monopolise them, and extra stock that I couldn't sell before natural prices reassert themselves post-monopoly will still be sold at a small profit anyway, since the average price will be higher after my influence. It takes time and risk to figure out the tide markers for such markets, but once you have a bit of gold it's worth doing some prodding around.
---
Spriest isn’t really a spriest until they get shadowform tbh, until then you’re just a wand spamming ‘priest’.
---
When levelling just focus on spirit &gt; intellect. Keep some +healing gear with you for healing dungeons too.
---
What the fuck do you mean B, Esfand getting rank 1s on ret Paladin and still being in the middle-top end of his raid team of players who are parsing purple on the “actual” dps classes on like half the bosses in MC.
---
Battle Shout aggro was nerfed after it was used to cheese the Nefarian fight in vanilla. It's good for initial aggro, like demo shout, but after that it certainly is not worth spamming.
---
Only use Heroic as an excess rage dump, you don't want to use it under standard low rage conditions because it replaces your swing, which means you won't get rage from that swing.
---
Depends on your server I guess, here MC and Ony are already on PUG and people are doing it with 30.
---
Not like you need to be skilled but lv60 people from now are either no lifers (crush the content with these OP blues they already farmed) or just efficient and plain good players. Sometimes they're even both.
---
I like MC, I like Ony and I like my role, but people already raiding will probably see some drops in their numbers due to the repetitive nature of the endgame.
---
Rerolling wasnt in my plans AT ALL and here I am.
---
I may reroll for this. No joke.
---
I am tired of waiting of bg's.
---
You might wanna split the psd up into regions and splice the end result together, then you can work on specific things without loading the whole behemoth. :) Great work btw!
---
Try Tanaris, it should just be coming into your level range. There are lots of good quests there for you to do, they are all close together and are decent kill quests! Give it a whirl!
---
How ignorant can you be? If bg’s are in phase 2 then there would be no Waco, have you sustained a head injury? Or can you only see your opinion
---
I once had a guy ninja loot a chest in a dungeon and then quit the group.  We cleared the rest without him while wondering the whole time "Who even ninjas a chest?"
---
Saying "Toon" instead of character...
---
there is no proof since i didnt feel the need to record, upload and post some random testing to reddit.
---
and im not even sure why im branded as some raving crazy person.
---
all im saying is that at the beginnin on MY server there were 8 layer and 12 didnt seem extremely far from that. (especially since there are more populated realms than mine)
---
last week i used 3 layerhops to check for a rare spawn.
---
im not talking about flat earth here.
---
The only macro of all these that makes sense is one to swap to battle stance and cast overpower which has already been shared.
---
Revenge should only be used when you're tanking and you should ignore it the rest of the time because it deals very low damage with very high threat (unless you're prot spec for the stun).
---
Execute should be given it's own button because you spam it against any tough enemies when they get below 20% anyway.
---
In other words, exactly like it was in vanilla.
---
FUCKING BLIZZARD FIX THIS SHIT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt;Nothing is keeping you from sending this file to a quality print shop and getting it printed though.
---
I mean, the law is stopping you, but I won't tell if you don't. (I have a0 prints of several images from the chronicles), if blizz sold them I would buy them, but they don't.
---
I chose prot (and did all of the necessary research on how to spec it properly) due to the sole fact that I love tanking in MMORPG's.
---
Do you think switching to Arms/Fury at this point is worth it? I'm on the fence about it. Part of my brain is telling me to stick with Prot because I'll continue to familiarize myself with it for when I raid eventually. The other part of my brain is telling me I may have more to gain by switching to a DPS talent tree for now. It feels pretty smooth as is currently...
---
Ops might be in trouble here if we learn from the great Mr Jenkins.
---
There is a great crafted helm for you that is bis even at 60 that you can get from the AH at lvl 40 called the Wolfshead helm and it’ll only cost you about 5-6g depending on your server!
---
Mmmm it’s strange that main tank would Raid lead. 
---
For us (vanilla) it was hunter, mark + he is far away to see the field ( remember it was time befor discord and stuff, and not everyone had ventrilo servers)
---
It's even more true irl.
---
Lmao. 
---
MY DAD OWNS BLIZZARD ILL HAVE U BANNED
---
Unless a hand actually comes out of the PC, it is not "literally".
---
because once BGs go live those kind of raids are a thing of the past anyway ...
---
Wait, how do they know that's a real girl?
---
Yeah because morons keep using it wrong they made it a rule.
---
Try to look at the average. If you struggle healing the average group it's you. If you can heal multiple groups just fine like you did and then 1 group blows up on you it's them.
---
Well if the chap has put it on COD at your request you could have to decency to complete the deal.
---

If it can somehow comforts you, it gets better.  Having played private servers i said to my friend early on "don't worry about the aoetards, "the great filter" will take care of them". Unfortunately it wasn't really accurate, classic turned out to be way easier than private so you can still play like shit until the late game and you don't get punished hard enough to learn to play better. Although, the filter does exist! It just starts later than i thought. ZF should usually be the last dungeon you see 2h tanks. Maraudon and BRD are so fucking long to complete, some of the trash/boss are actually hard, the walk back is atrocious. It just take one wipe to make everyone realize that they don't want that to happen again.
---
&gt; In the 40s now I just leave when I join and see a warrior 2h tanking 
---
You should, especially now that you're in the 40s.  People praise the aoe meta but they don't understand that taking 10 more minutes to finish a 1 hour+ dungeon because you play it safe is better than wiping ...
---
Isn't the feral 3% crit party only?
---
Even so, the difference in resources is monumental and Blizzard should have no problem. When world bosses drop this is going to be the norm, they should know that.
---
Fury warriors are the new frostmages. Change my mind.
---
Bought the shoulders last Night on My priest for 40'ish Gold. Since they require a BOP item (dark runes or something) i didnt wanna bother a guldie to farm them for me. They also drop from demons in felwood and are very nice for Shadows and warlocks :)
---
Yep. I'm lvl 38. Thought I would have the time to do Onyxia, dungeons and MC with my main as well as a twink I'd like to level. But Looks like the content will be faster than me and I have to hurry, just because some people wanted to rush to lvl 60 and clear MC as fast as possible.
---
Definitely not during leveling. Maybe should have said that
---
Census basically doomed Skeram/Stalagg by indirectly confirming horde dominance.  If that census addon was actually correct there was already a 63/37 split.  Now its probably close to 80/20.
---
He is the most popular so his named is used the most often but most streamers in his position use their notoriety to gain unearned advantages and gear or gold. They act as if they are sharing unknown insights and are privy to such information and skill when in reality they are being carried by their fans. Asmon specifically is incredibly rude and  condescending to other content creators and players. 
---
Look up a video where he reads comments on the blizzard forums. He literally tells his fans to bully commenters, why it’s okay, why they should do it and for what reasons he has made up.
---
fuck, you're right.
---
Now I know what I will print and but in the last empty space in my gaming room, thank you!
---
99% of the time the joke will be mistaken for a real comment because it's incredibly common to have an American correct your spelling when using British English on Reddit.
---
I think your just bad at finding pugs, I see 4 guilds looking for people to fill mc raid everyday
---
All the phase 1 content will still be available to you. 
---
This just means that the more serious players are getting something to do, and even that isnt until 2-3 months from now. Stop worrying.
---
.... how is it even possible? You tell her "baby, I laf you" and she doesn't punch you? :P
---
I see you're getting peppered with downvotes, but i agree so much with this.
---
Stonks ➚➚➚
---
Is it or does the AH seem like it's flooded with mats right now? I did dual gathering skinning/mining while leveling and auctioneer is recommending that I vendor my stacks of leather.
---
I leveled as prot as well since the beginning and obviously while being fury or arms makes leveling quicker, I'd say stick with it if you prefer the tank and spank style of playing plus it's fun in dungeons if you prefer tanking. In the end its about whether you enjoy it or not. Considering you have been leveling as prot so far, I assume you aren't a min-maxer and don't care about leveling speed that much. Just don't let others talk you into a fury spec for leveling if you want to play prot and don't care about fury all that much.
---
They're already in prot gear, they're not gonna be doing much damage anyway.
---
I'm going to take a guess here:
---
use /cast Pick Pocket
---
not /cast Pickpocket
---
I saw an ad for this guild once, they boasted they had one "verified female" and asked everyone to join their ranks of neckbeards. The chat filled up with "Feeeemale?" type comments. They even promised for a small fee you could talk to her on discord for 5 minutes.
---
Honestly I don't understand why people camp this pet for so long, the levelling curve is around level 40 now, badlands is starting to get visited alot and all spawn locations are on high traffic areas, one is literally next to the area entrance and a couple of mining nodes.
---
In addition to this you have the competition of every other hunter who got to level 37 in this time.
---
Think about it logically for 5 minutes after camping for a hour and realise its not worth it. Just log your character out in badlands and go play something else, then check the spawns in the early morning.
---
self reflection to see where and if i could improve, but sometimes you just end up meeting with asshats and no amount of skill is gonna help there.
---
so most of the times i get liquored up, and cheeched as well so i dont worry about that stuff
---
Listen. We were all new once and you have a long road til the end of the game. You'll get new abilities and spells to help heal knuckleheads like this. You have to realize when someone points a finger at you they are also pointing three at these. This isn't retail you don't get too do some farm with a healer at 20% Mana. Their behavior says more about their poor play style and social skills. Personally I block people like that so I don't have to waste another second with them in the future.
---
If you think content has been rolled out too slowly you've played classic wrong by speed running and rushing to 60. I've been playing almost every day since release and I'm only almost level 40. In my guild of 150 people there's only like 5 level 60s. What did you expect to happen, not burnout?
---
Pretty sure he called her $g priest: priestess;
---
That's really not relevant to my question or the point I was making.
---
You claim that simply because you posted a rock for less than vendor price and it sold instantly, then it must be a bot, because no ordinary player would ever search for a useless rock.
---
**Here you miss the fact that most sniper addons will (unless configured otherwise) not search for specific items (e.g. your rock), but instead refresh the first page of unfiltered auctions.**
---
When someone points out that *major* flaw in your reasoning, you said:
---
&gt; But it won't tell you the moment an auction is listed since you need to be at the AH to do that.
---
I then pointed out that there are a lot of people (characters) at the AH most of the time.  
---
I was implying that since there are a lot of people, there's a high chance of someone running a sniper scan. You completely missed that.
---
Hell, if I was online (and on the same server, obviously) there's a decent chance that I would've been the guy buying that rock.  
---
While I haven't done it in Classic yet, in Retail I'd sometimes just run the sniper while playing other games and simply tab into WoW when it found a deal.
---
Your conclusion is heavily flawed. Come up with a decent methodology to test your hypothesis, then try again.  
---
If you can't reasonably prove that someone like me didn't buy the rock, you can't reasonably prove that it was a bot either.
---
Oh, and take off the tinfoil hat, it's not a good look.
---
If you check boosting sites it's not actually that far off...
---
Was Rogue afk when you charged and priest reading something? Their reaction is close to zero, when you attack. Nice crits tho.
---
guild vs guild was a thing in vanilla as well..
---
I mean hey, I'm glad to die. Thank you for killing me Blizzard, I hadn't expected that you would.
---
Honestly at this point you might as well stick with Prot and start doing some ZF AoE runs.  As an Arms warrior, this is the only situation I've come across so far where I've thought it would be nice to have a Prot spec so that I can pull larger packs safely.  
---
I've heard that Thrash Blade is the minimum point at which you want to switch to dual wielding Fury if that's your goal.  The ZF runs will carry you to the point you can comfortable complete a Mara run and you can make the transition then.  At this point you will also have just enough points to go full Fury and also full Tactical Mastery which for me is mandatory for smooth tanking.  Not sure if that's better than Arms overall but that's the route I would take if Fury was my goal.
---
It's not my mother tongue, therefore I think "love" in my head but write "laugh", because it sounds the same. I'm no Shakespeare, shit happens. No reason to be snide.
---
There are always groups that exist that don't play for fun, like this sounds like, but you can heal just fine if you've done higher level instances than they were running. Who cares about exp per hour? Just have fun. Keep going with your healing, it's not you that will be in trouble at end game, it's the idiots that can't get a group because they think they know everything. I play a priest and have run into groups like this, I just don't join them :D
---
I got lucky and got there shortly after someone else had done it. So I sorta hid and watched as people would check and then pass through. Was able to get 3 of them.
---
I'm tired of my Youtube feed being filled with this pencil necked weirdo. *Asmongold reacts to Insert New Thing*
---
His reactions are fucking BOOOOOORING.  "Oh, huh, I didn't know that.  Really?"  
---
Click on ONE WoW video and suddenly you get a ton of the Asomongold.
---
What are you talking about LOL. You can clear ony and mc in under 3 hours easily, you’re so dumb and clearly not 60
---
You might not realize it because you play druid but there's like 99 warrior for every tank druid  so it's really rare to get one. Like seriously i leveled from 20 to 55 almost only doing dungeons, i've only seen 1 feral druid.
---
How many times did you die to get there?
---
Except 60s farming anyone lower than 51 don’t receive HK’s
---
Thanks for this detailed input! 
---
As I see, I have to level up atleast to 55, so I will be able to farm higher value cloths for crafting.
---
orc female warlock or troll mage &gt; ud casters
---
LMAO yeah LV saying "Ding" 5 times a day was super annoying though right? &lt;Eternal&gt; haha
---
Interesting. I'd not heard of this before.
---
Damn boy. Who hurt you this morning? Let everyone have an opinion. Just because you don't agree with mine, no need to cry about it
---
Not everyone wnats the same? There are plenty of people like me who want to enjoy wpvp
---
It's really deeper than this.
---
Entry raids are easy and it will be hard to keep the retail PvE players until BWL, which will show some challenge but not much.
---
Then AQ40 will be pure hell for most and will need a solid roster while Naxx will be progress on most servers.
---
But how will Blizz keep the players until Naxx ? That's where the game knowledge is at. If you know that It's gonna be even more fun than now you stick around.
---
If you believe the "Naxx is easy and puggable" bullshit then yeah you should quit. Because you'll never wait enough, and you'll get trampled to death for weeks when you realize that your guild sucks.
---
I like Asmongold.  He's a good person.
---
You do realize most guilds want to clear Molten Core in as little time as possible, right?  And any guild which doesn't care how long they take might not be desirable?
---
By your logic you dont "need" any bis item, I always wonder what these players "need" to use their gold on instead? You wont "need" an epic mount before P4 either but it seems to be a common answer..
---
This is a colossal work, an epic map, a marvel of this time.
---
However, where Mankrik's wife??
---
I think you're greatly overestimating how not hardcore 90% of classic players are. We're here to have fun.
---
Original vanilla timeline had this content launch in 3 months roughly. We are already over 1 month in so I dont really feel this is "rushing".
---
But the swich is such a lovely place.
---
And that's good for you. Never claimed that my opinion needs to be enforced on everyone. I enjoy world pvp too. But I would just like to have world pvp and bgs at the same time.
---
I was actually having more of an issue with the hunter scattershot and having his pet dps an unmarked target
---
I hate laughing so hard at the fails. Poor me.
---
It's MONTHS from now and also only dire maul unlocks. You won't miss shit as regards raids, jeez.
---
This isn't BFA. Not everyone gets to experience all content in vanilla. Content was released even faster in actual vanilla.
---
Got Robes of Insight on my first run and The staff on my second
---
You should've sold the gold for cash, sounded like you could've made a pretty good buck
---
Damn that does feel kind of fast. Feels like I just started classic and I've been playing since day one. Hopefully some of these phases are a lot further down the line. Phase 2 coming before the end of the year sounds great because of the pvp. The rest though, I think they need to pump the brakes a little bit and spread this out some more unless they have ideas for after phase 6.
---
Why you hate him?  He rectifies anyone on his guild who ninja loots and deals with that all the time. One exemple: the crown helm dropped and his best friend Mconnel wanted to ninja it when there was another pally in the raid, and asmo ignored Mconnel and rolled it and the other pally won. Don't be to quick to judge!
---
I’m not hurt? You’re just posting really stupid comments, let’s release battlegrounds so there is no wpvp (which will be amazing content and some people prefer this to battlegrounds FYI) which will also shorten classic over all life cycle. So smart, any more ideas?
---
Wow, you are completely right, that macro is pointless.
---
Hahahahaha, you're a funny one :D
---
&gt; I have been hearing that leveling as Fury is better until endgame.
---
Arms is better as leveling until you have some gear as 60, then you can go fury. You want atleast 9% hit before you switch imo.
---
You shouldnt go fury before level 60, if you want to level as a damage dealer go Arms.
---
Because they’re not the golden girls?
---
Back in the early days of WoW my brother in law sold his Everquest  account with a level 60 Druid.  Got $350 from some guy in Japan.
---
Soon after Everquest and WoW started cracking down on account sellers.
---
Must be "The Pants of the [Defenseless Anus](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1309320-fate-type-moon)" of legend!!!!
---
Maining Hunter but need an alt for pvp and guild runs. I'm stuck between rogue, warrior and Warlock. Rogue is great in wpvp and obviously great dps but in bgs they are a bit weak. I've also mained a rogue from wotlk to bfa. I really really want to play a Fury warrior, it looks fun to be an unstoppable duel wield berserker but there's two problems, i hate using slam and i won't have a pocket healer as i mostly pvp solo so i doubt I'll be able to kill much. Warlock, i love the class fantasy, vanilla and tbc were my favorite Warlocks and what i mained and likely what i want to play, HOWEVER, i can't play a gnome, i tried and i can't and human males/females look kinda terrible as casters but I've never really seen one in gear and to be fair a lot of races look bad before gear.
---
 So there it is, thoughts?
---
Does anyone have an informed opinion on Bone Slicing Hatchet (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18737/bone-slicing-hatchet) as Orc warrior tank weapon? I feel like it should be pretty decent and better than all the swords you find in the BiS lists out there specifically for Orcs. The only two other axes out there seem to be Serathil (not gonna drop 100g+ on a mediocre sidegrade) and Tooth of Eranikus (hate that dungeon, and if I get 6% hit from somewhere else also worse).
---
The game launched less than a month ago.
---
&gt;I was apart of the implementation team of a billion dollar business, and our T1 to T3 supports would send us tickets to handle because they were out of their scope, does that make me who was a person who was above a T3 support(Our team actually didn't even handle tickets normally) now a T1?
---
Please ask for ITIL training. Your question is inane and unfitting for someone who claims to know as much about support processes as you are.
---
I just realised he’s probably going to draw Sally Whitemane soon...
---
You know him?
---
Im positive you do not get your money back if the item doesnt sell.
---
You lose the AH deposit if the item does not sell.
---
Nah bro you don't which is why you should consider vendoring some greens if they aren't worth that much anyway. Might not Well = wasted deposit :)
---
No. 
---
You get deposit back only if the item sells. 
---
Also, if the item sells, the AH gets a cut off the sale price as well. I don’t remember that percentage so you need to look that up.
---
Right!  My dwarf hunter laughs at every disease and poison.  And lemme tell ya that dealing with the Undead and Worgen in Darkshore that racial is so damn great.
---
Nah business deals fall through all the time so it's not about "decency" to spend out 30g on something I may not want or use after seeking advice, he volunteered to send it COD anyway. I've had several deals fall through after I've sent things COD to people at their request and hold no grudge against them.
---
Drinking two fire prot pots in an ony kill upto 6500 health. The1000 health you gain from this set pale in comparison to proper protection. 
---
You won't be gaining the +80SP in other consumables though.
---
It's great in PvP and open world, however in raids it's just not great, no other way to describe it.
---
I read it the same... I MAYBE get an hour or two on the occasional weekends... I’m only level 26 and been trying hard haha
---
Well saying I sustained a head injury because I have a different opinion than you, is pretty butthurt. World pvp will be just as active as it would be with BGs. There are 1000s of people still getting to 60 and even when they reach 60, they will still be out there farming mobs/mats. I really don't see the problem of releasing both at once
---
You're a moron. I know exactly how it works. Everything is processed by the server. Everything. Every, single, thing. That's because every client needs to have the same information. That's why you need a server to begin with. If "most things" where done client side you could just run the entire game P2P.
---
thx for killing innocents, helping the imperialistic superpower grow and spreading war arround the world! very nice
---
That's how language evolves my dude.  Otherwise we'd all still be talking like it's 1819.
---
Warriors are not a very complicated class and prot is probably the least complicated spec (not saying playing as a tank is easy, but the spec doesn't add any new mechanics to tanking, just improves you ability) so I wouldn't worry about familiarizing yourself. Tanking while not being prot is basically exactly the same except you have 1 less CC ability, 1 less threat building ability and 1 less oh shit button. 
---
I would personally say it's worth it but it's up to you how you want to level. Prot will be slower for sure but you'll have less downtime from having better defense. I find arms to be the quickest by miles though due to the aoe you get from sweeping strikes.
---
https://i.imgur.com/snPaNzU.png
---
I found a way
---
You can accept and return this quest while dead btw.
---
It's a good thing IMO. of course its harder to farm and everything. But man the zones in BFA look soooooooo empty it almost creeps me out.
---
Downranking is less mana efficient while levelling. You need some +healing for downranking to be good..
---
No it's not I live there 🤣🤣
---
i have been doing this since launch, and its been a week where it stopped working for me :(
---
see also : varian, tirion fordring, etc
---
Paladins asking newbie's questions, Mages being salty, trolling and toxing and priests being helpful and friendly is like every stereotype of WoW community in one screenshot.
---
Cannibalize in world PvP to frighten your enemies and continue the fight.
---
i know, i remember. And that put me off back in the days to :/
---
Because by the time I'll be ready to do MC runs, it'll be impossible to build a raid from scratch, I'll just end up joining one that's already half- to full-geared, and we'll just roll on everything, and I'll never know what it is to actually do high level content as a group.
---
Without having a video or something the only thing that comes to mind is that he cast then stop to bait the CS.
---
[Insert comment about one of the designers saying something about there being a lot of cool stuff on ceilings that players miss because their cameras are pointed towards the ground that i stole from a thread from like ysterday]
---
&gt; They're going to kill off a lot of casual players doing that because people aren't going to deal with being camped at a flight path for 4months
---
PvE realms exist for those mega casuals who wont hit 60 in 4 months and also cant endure any hardship in a video game
---
The answer is Paladin.
---
Call/open a ticket and ask. It’s the same if you were to travel without notifying your bank, they’d shut access down if they noticed suspicious activity.
---
*cries in horde bias*
---
As a hunter that sometimes has trouble finding the right food for my pet I would sign up for a service that sends me a daily stack of the correct food.
---
You can take jokes? Bit up tight are we? Carm down. Like I said your stupid. You think the devs don’t have reason for realising them in phase 3? Maybe you should open your mind and look at the reason it’s phase 3. And again a stupid comment saying it would be the same, it really wouldn’t and if you think that there’s no helping you.
---
The constant talking in the background is too much to have this on
---
Sunk cost fallacy. He already spent the time, anymore time would be wasted.
---
So you’re one of these people that flew to 60 as fast as possible huh?
---
Especially as you are taken along mostly for utility in the beginning as warlock damage isn't that great. Go into the raid with 20% preBiS and gear yourself in 3weeks to 8/8 T1 not having to grind out abyssmal to farm pieces like Skyshroud or Ban'thok is a godsend.
---
Spell baiting maybe
---
Yea I thought so, but there are some extremely misleading info like  [https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/classic-auction-house-guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/classic-auction-house-guide) which simply says you get your deposit back
---
5% from your faction AH and 10% from neutral AH
---
Yes, I know. Although I'd like to do world bosses and stuff, it probably won't be much of a difference. But still my BiS list will change and I will probably need to go a lot into DM, even if it's just getting buffs for MC or so.
---
That doesn't change the fact that we don't ever get an item upgrade, which was the whole point of the discussion
---
Are you not an honorless target when coming off flight paths ? Seems kinda pointless to camp them
---
Thats like ignoring the scoreboard in CSGO, I have always been amazed (and sometimes a bit jelous) of people who can play multiplayer games without any competitive spirit.
---
the scale of the fights are very different. One is cool, the other one is gigantic and epic as fuck.  And it lagged.
---
But we did want #nochanges, this caused massive lags in  vanilla :)
---
As a warrior who is too lazy to do cooking and to buy food, I'd appreciate it too, just getting one stack of 1k-food every week or so would be A+
---
Maybe, but just like with account sellers you're putting in tons of hours of work for a pretty low wage when you look at it that way.  I did fine at my job at the time, so selling my wow gold never crossed my mind.
---
Well, this caused massive lags in vanilla, and we should still advocate for #nochanges.
---
What nameplate are you using that shows the mana regen intervals, and also the addon that shows the CC over each mob?
---
No they wont, finding New people takes forever, explainig takes minutes at most.
---
Asking everytime, Ive never been kicked.
---
S priest does incredibly high dps, lol, their problem is that they need to drink every fight.
---
I mean just a couple of weeks ago on the podcast Countdown to Classic they were very sceptical and unwilling to believe they will dissapear despite what Blizzard has been saying and doing.
---
Then again at the same time they thought everyone was abusing layering, that it is a huge issue and has fkd the economy and it is all Blizzards fault the instance "layering bug" was abused because "iT iS In tHe gAmE" and you fall so far behind if you don't do it too.
---
The self projecting was strong in that episode lol.
---
I don't get the hate. He brings such a huge community together, streams are somewhat entertaining to keep in background, loot decisions are alright, what to hate about him?
---
I really appreciate the feedback. Thank you for everything that's been said so far. One of my big reasons for sticking with Protection is just to master the rotation and build of it as I reach endgame. I am not in a rush, but I understand it is important to go outside of my comfort zone and cross-train. 
---
Feel free to comment any more advice! A newbie like me can use any warrior/tank tips that could save me hours of research. &lt;3
---
what addon do you use for gear sets?
---
What's even sadder is that the mejority of times trying to explain the difference nets you downvotes simply because you undermine the ignorancy or spread of misinformation about retail.
---
Did you try calling in LookingForGroup channel?  
---
I see LFG BFD there sometimes. Also I run it myself, without even using them.
---
The guys saying the increase in damage taken is marginal and offset by the kill speed are not taking in account the fact the healer can't manage his/her mana efficently if healing is more like putting out fires than scheduled maintenance. Healers generally like using efficent heals and abusing 5 sec rule and can go virtually drinkless the entire dungeon when they and tank both are geared and played well. Drinks are only needed after misspulls or other surprise factor.
---
I too enjoyed 2h tanking in lowbie instances, but by ZF i feel it's way faster when momentum is kept up by endless healer mana and rage pooling for initial rage. Sure if you go every pull with zero rage it's a real pain, whereas pooling some 50 rage and keeping it up with bloodrage during movement if needed really does away with all threat problems outside full on aoe.
---
Many of the dps specs can follow through without drinking (rogue, warrior, Hunter) and with efficent healer mana the pain train truly never stops. Mages and such can drink during the pull back and join in later to the fight, meter padding is the only reason not to do so.
---
i watched one wow video on YouTube and now his face is everywhere in the recommended... reacting to said videos?
---
It's kinda shameful too how the reactions get more views than the originals too.
---
Jesus H Christ they are moving *fast*.
---
People who don't make sure that the healer has enough mana for the next pull are big noobs imo
---
I think it might be Northrend, with the explanation that it has not been fully explored or they've drawn the ice as water.
---
They would not
---
I enjoyed it man I think you did well not being too invasive on her play and just letting her check things out at her own pace. Wish me luck in getting my wife interested in playing!
---
lol he very happy
---
Yeah, but as stated previously. Those two are listed
---
It's impossible, he had a full duration fear (took 4 secs to get to half duratoin, full duration is 8sec), for him to have that when he pops in he would have had to be summoned same exact second he got feared, you can't do that with the zoning in, the summon being required, and the fact that we saw 2 seconds of footage where he was not being summoned.
---
Its funny cause we do the exact same thing in our guild when people leave. Im in notorious on fairbanks horde side.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
While I 100% support the fashion over 1% more effectivness, fashion souls is on a whole other level. Aside from PVP armor has little to no impact in Dark Souls. There are a handfull situation where you want heavy armor (Looking at you capra demon) but most of the time you can wear whatever armor you want without having a huge impact on progression. Poise beeing the outliner naturally.
---
Exactly. Back in the day I used to game from ~7pm to ~3pm+ every day and never closed either T2 set OR moved beyond knight-captain. Dog farking gamnit.
---
You’re not allowed to change the email? But it’s cool of you to scam someone and then brag about it. Could’ve just sent the emails to your spam folder.
---
I wonder how much of the less EU servers being on one layer is due to lack of servers and not abundance of players.
---
If I master loot everything that's not fair to the rest of the group, I we all roll for it then it is. That was a silly statement.
---
Nah, not too broken. They are simply good at what they do - heck, not even exceptional, just good PVE and somewhat funny PVP.
---
Sure we have 2 tanks. 2nd Tank ist waiting out of Knockback range to intercept if the MT gets knocked back.
---
Melees run ofcause in and out. But as nejkyat pointed out, that may be the problem as they avoid aggro reduce while the MT does not
---
Was pretty I got a Frostbolt Counterspelled, but right after he got close and used a Frost Nova - as if he couldn't continue FB. But from my understanding Nova and FB are considered the same school, right? - I could be wrong tho, might have just baited.
---
Side note: if you want a better version of the carrion bird with the same abilities, get an owl. You will run with the carrion bird for a little while to learn screech, and teach that to your owl.
---
At 40 Badlands is perfect. If you have int/SPI gear and Mana pots, head to Uldaman around 42 - some nice loot, quests, gold and a 14slot bag reward. If you did not do RFD, you can head there at 40, before Badlands. 42-43 finish off southerns STV/BB (I left a few undone) and then you can head to Tanaris at 43-44. Finish it, do some feralas (screecher spirit quest from steamwheedle port, Tanaris is important as it leads to a dungeon chain), run ZF around 44 once you got all quests and then go Hinterlands. If you did not do all ZF quests (gahzrilla) head there once more if you feel like it, and make sure to do the elite Jintha'alor quests in hinterlands. You will be around 48-49 or so at this point, run a full Mara run and some Princess runs. Searing gorge should be doable around 50. Next Un'goro, and then Sunken temple, do some Felwood, start running BRD and questing in WPL/EPL/winterspring when level permits. End game dungeons and 60.
---
Why the underscore?
---
I was only just informed that it doesnt exist in classic. I copied the original macro.
---
&gt; Possible sickness I’ll admit lol. 
---
No, spite is a healthy response to wpvp shenanigans. That's why KoS-lists are a thing.
---
Yeap! I remember getting one of my finest kills with slowfalling into goldmine and then pompyroing a poor ud rouge. 
---
**JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE**
---
Someone is doing the benidiction quest, gz man!
---
I think the diminishing return comes in when you calculate that the higher amount ofxp you get from a red mob doesn't make up for the extra time and risk you'll spend
---
gear sets? I have extended stats but all the gear is just meticulously cropped from screenshots in paints to surround my character sheet
---
Should have just left tbh. Save yourself time.
---
My worry about blizzard saying very easily is that doesn't give a time scale. If I where a betting man I'd bet they are currently waiting it out to see if/what drop off in subs there are before investing in next X-Pac.
---
ROFL ahahahahah. Sry I just had to come back to you whining about people who have more time than you being more powerful in an mmorpg.
---
I really hope that your friends are not as pathetic as you but let be real. They are. ROFL hope you enjoy getting stomped in classic wow and in life. Peace bitch.
---
Brush it off. You like me probably have a way to play the game that you personally enjoy. When someone gets all in your face about that then you got to remember this is a game. You are playing to have a good time for yourself. WoW is a big place and I promise you’ll find people to enjoy the game with!
---
Thanks man, very thorough
---
BGs aren't in Phase 2.
---
Whole thing was scripted anyway, was a fake story made up for content.
---
Ad shammy I had 2 separate sets, one for Enhancement and another for healing dungeons. You're going to want to have a separate bank bag for the alt set, or pick it up for when you expect to do a dungeon - bag space will be limited at that point, though.
---
Works fine depending on gear and group. You will most likely have to switch weapons at certain points, Baron for example.
---
JETTINESS
---
Do me a favour and try reading the comments I originally replied to, no shit they aren’t.
---
All those flying numbers give me goosebumps
---
If its your first character probably not? I spent 30g and grabbed it for my alt and have been using it and I'm 52 on war still using it. As an orc this thing is amazing for its level. It's still far better than gator bite imo with the hit and raw strength and gator is a bit too quick for my liking.
---
If you dont got your mount yet just sell it.
---
Gangganggangganggangganggang
---
That's a funny way to spell tauren.
---
First?
---
Most likely a commie
---
I dont hate asmongold. I do however hate the fucking people that watch the reaction videos making it pop up in my recommendation over and over.. WHY DO REACTION VIDEOS EXIST??????
---
Always sunder don't use heroric only if you have way too much rage but even then I would have better ideas for that rage to use.
---
Who doesnt have a thing for uber-thick, skull-crushing meaty, musky and sweating man tights?
---
Dunno about master hunter but during vanilla I was the only mage in the guild with full arcanists **and I intend to repeat this**.
---
I don't think that's the reason people dislike him. He's just an enormous douchebag. I've seen 2 videos of him and in both he's extremely toxic and annoying.
---
classicwowpvp was unfortunately taken by somebody who wasn't looking to personally use the subreddit, but was looking to hold the name ransom.
---
You are gonna need a shit tonne of mageweave and silkcloth to get to 225 so my tip is find a nice place to grind out cloth for about 2-3lvls and get then start making that sweet ass dreamweave!
---
I wonder why everyone is into the idea that it's ok to pay 11£ for a game monthly that is an HD remaster of a 15 year old game , I mean wouldn't it be better to be a one time buy of 20£ not sure why people accept being ripped like that
---
Not a guide but (assuming you have the gathering profession to match) if you notice what sells well (good price, and sells for more than the mats) and it is still giving you skill points, just go ahead and make that instead. When it starts changing color to offer you less/no skill and nothing else you think is profitable is currently learnable, or you run out of those mats, make what the guide says to get you to the next goal.  I typically use the guides only to see what I can make to finish out a stretch of skill so I can get another higher level recipe I'm after.  I use it as filler basically.  Seems to work well for me.
---
Spec Imp WF and spam Cath till 43 and then ZF till 52 with 3 warriors and a priest that can manage his mana. 2 hours per level in an average group of randoms, it aint fun and its not honest work but atleast its quick.   
---
After that you can either quest or start farming BRD gear for 30k exp per hour and slowly die inside.
---
Or just getting kited by locks and hunters who are out of range and not reachable.
---
Some people are dicks.  
---
Add them to your list of dicks and move on.  
---
As a frequent healer main I can tell you that people often blame their bad play on the healer.  "hey man, I pulled half the dungeon you should be able to heal me through that."
---
[Your experience is a common one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQTl6lxQhoo)
---
This exact same thing happened to me today. Mage just shooting left and right in that same area of Gadgetzan. If you tried to fight back, guards would immediately aggroed on you. I reported the guy but god knows if Blizzard will do anything about it.
---
Its never to much!
---
Sounds about right. Whoever misses a few weeks of MC doesn't miss much at all.
---
It gets much better, hang in there. :)
---
Don't forget that you NEED warlocks in raids for Curse of Elements, Curse of Shadows and Curse of Recklessness. :)
---
Are there any notable tailoring recipes to help my priest in levelling? I try to keep it basic. I just made spider silk boots. I am lvl 29 currently. Thanks!
---
Okay, I agree.
---
So they really are just saving gold by getting the boe? Like everyone else is getting gold?
---
Gonna get some popcorn
---
This is about to get spicy
---
Yes. I’ll dm you.
---
Yikes dude
---
There are couple of threads on forums about this, the cooperation is done outside of the game but the actual threats are done ingame. Not sure if Blizzard has taken any action towards it.
---
No prob, this is the route my Shammy took (now 59). Not following any guides so there might be more efficient routes, just going on average zone quest level and took it from there.
---
I'mre there were some slightly slower points during the leveling, but those can often be solved with a dungeon or two - I made sure to do every single one so far, except Gnomeregan. 
---
I was Enh until 52/53 when I went deep resto, but could heal everything just fine up to ST as Enh. In retrospect it would have been smoother to level from 40-52 as Ele I believe, gear is more similar to Resto (easier on bag space if you want to heal some dungeons) and damage is steadier and less RNG than with 2h WF.
---
Oh, for early 50s, Blasted lands is also great if it is not too crowded. Forgot to add that one.
---
i don't get this, i've seen people say that because of streamers there's way more people together than there ever were on say Light's Hope, and that might be true, but there also would literally be like 5x ally raids taking over Orgrimmar on Light's Hope and RP'ing it like a fucking Alliance city lol, i don't see how this would be possible on classic.
---
&gt;This isn't retail
---
Exactly. That's why they shouldn't timegate everyone for the sake of the casual audience. Like they do on retail.
---
If you enjoy that, go play BFA.
---
Yeah let's be honest. Even if it is an upgrade for the warrior, he 99% won't equip it and sell it for hundreds of gold.
---
Don't hate the streamers, hate the fanboys.
---
Which makes them have 33% chance of winning the roll instead of 20% if they had rolled need first.
---
Gnomies is sort of the halfway house for those who have joined these MC/Onyxia pugs over the last few weeks. We don't even have a tabard. :D
---
Stacks of 5 mana potions on tuesdays are roughly 6g and for one potion it's about 70s or so to make

I'm on Faerlina so the market is flooded
---
&gt; I just think its unfair if someone got lucky an an item they could use drops they would't get it so that people could sell it for gold. 
---
Equipping a boe is equivalent to the same amount of gold you're saving that I could sell it for. Why should you automatically get it just because you can equip it instead of the other four people getting a chance to roll for it and sell it for a boe that's bis for them?
---
Large scale PvP is really fun. It all about coordination, using rogues and hunters to scout the enemy and avoid traps, know when not to get baited into using ur sappers and cd's when u dont need them, setting up traps and flanks with diffrent groups to sandwitch the opponent etc.  
---
Large scale pvp isnt so much about individual skill but how well organized and strategic u play. Thats why some 40 man groups can wipe double their numbers.
---
Why no Bejeweled?
---
All of this would be solved if they allowed you and your friends to free transfer to a new server, and let you choose which server you want, not just force you into one selected server. My friends and I were seriously considering RP PVP instead of regular PVP for the added immersiveness and creativity people get into, such as Warlock Uber.
---
A man on a mission. Too bad creating a monopoly on AH usually fails
---
Hello! This is mostly a question for (probably) more experienced players: When it comes to BoE's as an Orc fury warrior, should I invest into Devilsaur set, flurry axe, Edgemasters, or Axe of the Deep Woods first? Which would you invest into first and why?
---
Yeah I'd be surprised if anyone was wanting to pay 90g for a cosmetic item currently but who knows. Best of luck.
---
Easy way to get content out there and fans will watch it and make the creator ad revenue.

Worst part of sheep isn't the incoming pyroblast, it's the fleas man... the fleas.
---
That does not even need to be communicated. DPS gear *is* tank gear and if people disagree with that they can honestly go suck it and find another tank.
---
Can you read? I said if you have a group of 3+ people who need the eyes, you need to kill the Solakar waves so everyone can get the eyes.
---
The second I saw this, I thought: "This must be Zandalar Tribe". Glad I was right :D
---
haha... still on the fence about that. I'm a bit tempted to leave the final encounter for the Alliance series ;)

well vanilla was 2 years and few mounths

's articles on Classic wow have straight up wrong info on Classic wow, so basically disregard all their shit.
---
You do realize this was a 5 guild coalition set up hours in advance for the sole purpose of wiping this Alliance guild.... and they only managed to kill one rogue what do you mean they didn't have organization.
---
There were like 5 simultaneous streams from Horde PoV you can watch, including a very funny one of one of the dudes claiming they "Lighted so hard". (Spoiler: they didn't)
---
I think I’m in too deep. Plus for a regular officer I’m sure it would be a career killer. It’s already insanely competitive, and starting over as a AF Captain I’d be way behind.
---
I think there's lots of different ways to enjoy classic, so you do you, but saying "Most of the guild members are only logging in for a handful of hours per day" is very far from what I consider casual. A handful of hours per day is a lot of playtime.
---
Fuck yeah Forteresse! They were also great live.
---
The latest Moonsorrow album was good too, didn't really like the couple before that.
---
I got invited last spot with a ready group and they want me to switch role just like that?? Like it is not a big deal for me to equip the shield and Change stance!?!? What the fuck is this???
---
Preposterous!! Bring back groupfinder!! This is getting ridicolus. 
---
Thought these snowflakes were stuck in retail...
---
I find the only people using LFG are for higher level dungeons, so for lower level ones I tend to go to the zone it's in or near and ask in Zone Chat.
---
So I have to grind level first of all, to be able to farm locations that has megawave.
---
6%
---
I can already tell 90% of the posts are gonna be questions people could've googled in 2 seconds.
---
Good reply. Really convincing proof you got there!
---
You literally have no proof that it was a bot, yet you’re convinced it must be. Why?  
---
Right now, you seem to be dumber than the damn rock you sold, lmfao.
---
So is that a correct usage for "probably"?
---
On boe greens it doesn't really matter. It's polite to ask if anyone minds if you need.
---
On bop gear you should need for mainspec upgrades and it's polite to ask if anyone minds for offspec/sidegrades.
---
On boe blues/epics there are two different schools of thought. Some people think that people who equip it should automatically get it and some people think that everyone should have an equal chance to roll for it. Personally I'm in the latter camp. Whatever your opinion is, it's generally a good idea to communicate with the group what they want before you roll.
---
Fun fact. The army uses ventrillo for their chat software for battalion hq and higher.
---
yes! I switched to Track Resources linked below. works fine so far, no issues.
---
He's popular.
---
sqeakers
---
Why hate him? I think everyone mostly likes him when I sometimes watched him he would have like 500 viewers or so (long time ago). Now he's pulling 50k+. Big portion of the WoW playerbase likes him a lot.
---
Or make a disenchant alt.
---
Looks amazing. One small error I noticed is you have deadmines listed as a 24-32 dungeon.
---
Druids are gangsters at endgame. A lot of the reputation they have is based on previous patch cycles because before I think 1.9, they kind of DID suck. But they buffed the crap out of them and changed them a lot after that.
---
Resto Druids are a solid, very efficient tank healer. They are vulnerable to snipes and have no traditional rez, but are absolutely viable.
---
Feral Bears are one of only two truly viable raid tanks. They can comfortably main-tank EVERYTHING save a few fights in BWL/Naxx. 
---
Feral Cats are capable of some very high single target DPS and are probably the best choice for somebody looking for a true challenge. They require that you farm a ton of Crowd Pummlers and have a punishing rotation/playstyle but its very rewarding.
---
Balance Druids...are sub-par. No way around that. To many things resist nature damage, they have mana problems and just are in a constant uphill battle.
---
So unless your a chicken (and even than if you work hard enough your probably going to do acceptable damage) than you are absolutely a viable endgame player.
---
i'm sure they must feel ashamed to have miss northrend, pandaria, the borken isles, kul tiras and all those areas who kept spawning
---
Yeah this is the impression I got also, though admittedly cleverly done. I didn't catch on until he watched the clip of the guys "apology" and then they watched the clip of the other gm ninja looting also.
---
Sounds like a 1SG problem.
---
Moonkins have innervate for healers and combat ress though
---
4 silk bags will give you 56 slots in inventory.  
---
That's more than enough to keep second set of gear.  
---
There's no "cross gear" that give all the stats. And stamina is only useful for tanks, other classes don't even "weight" it as stat.
---
I tank 31 fury 20 prot, duel wield and only shield for bosses that hit real hard or when it's a huge pull, I don't loose out on dps in the world and actually am more effective as a tank in dungeons as I pull a shitload more threat although you need to make sure your healer is aware otherwise they might not be healing you frequently enough and you lose your ability to stance dance as you don't get anger management but yeah all in all very effective way of tanking
---
The times ive made tickets in the past ive had to wait a day or so before i got a response, longest wait was 2 days. This is between vanilla and wod.
---
tiger gear is the right direction for dps. make sure you also pick up a wolfshead helm.
---
but really, you shouldn't be having issues holding threat as bear. spam tab swipes for 3 or more enemies and tab maul for 2 or less. if someone pulls, either taunt before it leaves melee range or charge and taunt, then drag is back to the main pack.
---
also, mark kill targets. casters&gt;healers&gt;ranged&gt;melee. so long as dps follows your kill order, you definitely shouldn't have threat issues.
---
I am willing to bet naxx gets pugged. people kept severely overestimating how hard these contents actually are
---
I've been playing loyaly since the end of wrath and I've never seen this.
---
if your friend would rather leave the group and keep searching (which forces the other 4 ppl to keep waiting aswell) just so he can spam heroic strike instead of sunder armor, then he should also stop acting like an idiot! :)

What about +25 agility?
---
Deep fury DW tanking is a high end game thing (maximum threat build for guilds with very good DPS who otherwise threat cap in fights, requires solid gear on everyone in the raid). It's not really good for 5m dungeon tanking due to the lack of strong AoE, which is kinda the point of dropping the shield in 5m dungeons.
---
2h arms dungeon tanking is a thing, if the group is good enough for it. With Sweeping Strikes and Whirlwind you get very solid initial AoE threat, and then due to incoming damage you have a lot of rage to build more threat. This allows DPS to go ham and bomb the group down. This method works very well when it does, and completely falls apart when it doesn't, the breaking point being "can the healer keep the tank alive until the group is dead". This requires a bit of levels, gear and brain on everyone in the group, and enough AoE damage in the group comp.
---
Got my Robes a week or so ago as well, did MC PUG on Tuesday to get it in before reset and Staff of Dominance dropped from Golemagg and I rolled a solid 96.
---
May as well quit til P3 now
---
Orcs already have +weapon skill to axes so id avoid edgemasters altogether they are mainly for non human/orc warriors who don't have racial +weapon skill
---
Can you share your Talent tree with me? I may try it out.
---
I could care less.
---
Or a guide you follow :)
---
HAOSHASHAAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Yeah, probably had to wait a day or so before you got responses, maybe its an eu thing.
---
BGs wont come put untill phase 3. And averything you mentioned looking forward to wont go away in phase 2. MC and ony will still be the only raids in phase 2
---
Tf are you talking about? Servers like nostalrius had more than 6k online at any time and furthermore I am sure there are plenty of people on this sub who are pretty knowledgeable about the topic, this is not even relevant to the discussion anyway. 
---
I bet this is just because the game uses a new architecture compared to 1.12, back then it was ran on a single machine and the project was designed for these kind of events while current versions are sharded so you can easily deal with load by splitting up players into more layers so you can spread the load to multiple servers. I am sure there are a lot of changes that happened to the server code since then to make it run worse for these kind of scenarios.
---
Just like this subreddit :)
---
Its a multiplayer game. This is what makes it great and bad in the same time. Just shake it off, do a different dungeon with different group and you will get into good mood again. Best if you can do dungeon with friends chatting over disc.
---
It wont die off. The fact that people played years and years on private servers proves it. there are people who only want to keep playing classic and if they wont keep atleast one classic server it will be just stupid. Also they can go for seasons (??) after all phases comes out, they can open new server with phase 1.competative people would like that very much so they can race for 60 again, and new people who come to classic wont feel so far far behind joining server thats 2+ years old
---
Faerlina - human warriors
---
Probably because Mages do bigger dmg than Warlocks, so may as well make your strongest stronger to make the run smoother for most.
---
reading the comments here I just realised how TBC is much more thought through and better than this crap
---
TBC waiting room...
---
Yes, I’ve found a nice guild and got a lot of support there. But we are few and hard to find groups.
---
ull never win
---
Nah. Its a bunch of idiots hating on someone kz hes popular. 
---
Whats funny is how smart he is about it as he says and do stuff on purpose knowing that it will trigger those same people and thus he gets more free PR from posts like these.
---
What is absolute though is that his chat has some of the most retarded people ever.
---
Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.
---
Soo yea often we just Leroy it.
---
that's true, especially for regular, quest dungeon groups. LFG is just SPELLCLEAVE all around, at least on my realm
---
In a perfect world that sounds awesome. The reality us that BGs will kill 95% of the world pvp because wpvp just wont be an effective way to farm honor anymore.
---
Fuck you too buddy. Yeah they dungeon grouped them. Big whoop.
---
So based on the video alone, you think horde was organized? Since alliance were the one attacking and got all the sappers off and horde gone none? And does it look to you that there were 5 horde guilds there?
---
What unit?
---
They will be there to camp the level 51 plus players, lower levels that happen to use that fp will just end up as collateral.
---
"But look at my damage numbers"
---
*Drools into keyboard*
---
You're sacrificing the time somewhere. How's your sleep? How many hours a week are you working? Are you married? Have kids? Pets that need attention? Do you do any type of exercise? How long and is that number different from before classic launched? You don't need to answer these btw. 
---
I work full time and could be 60 already (I'm only 43 as it is) but it'd mean not going to the gym for 90-120 mins every day and ignoring my wife in the evening. I'd have to cut down to 5-6 hours of sleep a night instead of the 8-8.5 I normally get. I have a 2 hour commute round-trip every day so I normally end up with legitimately 1.5 hours free time a day tops and half of that is spent feeding and playing with my dogs after dinner. 
---
So, sure I could be 60 but I won't pretend I wouldn't have to give up my "life" to do it. I'm okay that folks rushed to 60 but they do need to step back and realize while it's not the norm, it's definitely not even close to being barely uncommon. It's rare and they shouldn't be expecting Blizz to cater to their time-line.
---
You know that you can just click “not interested” and then ignore his entire channel?
---
&gt;vast majority of people do not hate asmongold
---
I'd argue that the vast majority doesn't really care one way or the other. Didn't watch his stream, don't intend to and only heard of him because of the obsession this sub seems to have with him.
---
If you don't like him - don't watch him and stay away from the server he plays on. Luckily it's not being pushed in your face like with some other streaming personalities in some other games.
---
I too play a warlock, the random act of kindness would probably be the infernal summons on top on lowbies.
---
Is it bad to roll on resto gear from end game dungeons if i am running those dungeons as a druid tank?
---
&gt;Personally I dont care how much imaginary gold I could sell something for. I'd rather have someone on the team benefit the most that they can from the group's effort. There'll be other drops and more gold along the way.
---
So if a boe epic drops and I could sell it to buy the boe epic that I want then I don't benefit from winning it?
---
This argument only holds up if gold doesn't = character progression. But since it does it's only logical that everyone in the group have the same opportunity to roll for an item that has the same value to all of them.
---
I can't imagine being able to make almost 30s, less auction fees, profit per potion, I'd be rich if I could do that
---
IIRC engineering is the best profession for PvP and even PvE for a hunter. But that's chasing the last 0.X% DPS so I wouldn't feel pressured to go for it. If you wanna go herb/alch that's perfectly fine.
---
With Asmongold it's more just years and years of him being obnoxious starts to build up a healthy hatred. Years of just sitting on stream accepting gold trades, "reacting" to videos with "yeahhh" "wOw" and "TRUE", being genuinely shit at the game but being carried to major achievements and then organising groups of players like hes a ww2 general.
---
Ya know, the usual stuff.
---
Why would he mind?
---
Jack Sparrow
---
Yeah, no, everything has been going well, I was having a blast. Both in groups and solo.
---
I’ve looked forward to this one! 
---
My main is a priest, but I’ve started a warrior alt. I saw some people suggest macros for tanking, so you can charge in with a 2hander, demo shout, switch to berserker and whirlwind, then switch to defensive stance as well as equipping a 1hander and a shield. How do I go about doing this? 
---
Also, I’m a troll looking to go DW at end level, but when can I do this and is there anything I should make sure to get along the way, gearwise?
---
Currently level 15, going for anger management and planning to go down the arms tree, is this okay, or would a different spec be better? 
---
Lastly, I’m leveling cooking as well, should I get any specific recipes that will help while leveling?
---
I can imagine a fair few would be, but as time passes there will be more discussions than questions.
---
Just use a vpn to your home location
---
This is factually wrong. God I hate when dumb uninformed people spout out nonsense. 
---
Druids are EASIER to heal in MC before Warriors get decked out.
---
Druids are superior on pure threat fights.
---
Druids are stronger on patchwork, both as a MT and OT.
---
Yes
---
don't think there's much more than that... and I don't know of any such lists
---
I just reached level 24 with my Feral Druid.  My Warrior (current main) is at 44.  I am curious if there are any specific dungeons that my Warrior can solo that would be beneficial to my Druid?  Specifically, is there any gear that I should farm now that will last him SEVERAL levels.  I enjoy doing regular questing, but I sure do enjoy it when the blue gear adds up that makes life easier. 
---
Cheers All and Happy Friday!

How do I figure out what's coming in phase 2 later this year?

Yeah I’m working on having a heal ready and cancelling if not needed.
---

Combat ress is more valuable. If you need resses so much someone is fucking up. Most of the time when people die it’s a wipe anyway and a combat ress might prevent that wipe.

People like me who get to max level fast want blizzard to timegate stuff like when raids open? Did you actually think your post through before posting?
---
Why do you want the content to be released SLOWER and being MORE timegated than it was 15 years ago? Because there are people who are ahead of you and you want daddy blizzard to bottleneck them until you have caught up in 6 months?
---
 Sounds like the exact reason why retail became what it is. (People like you)
---
Say "Ding" when you level or /gkick
---
Yes.
---
You should roll for the stuff you are joining the group as, regardless of whether that is your spec or not. Roll for the role you are filling in the group. If the healer does not need it you can ask if you can need it for offspec, but snatching an item for a different role than what you're currently playing would be something I'd kick for. 
---
How'd you like it if some healer or druid kitty DPS rolled on your pre-raid BiS tanking loot and won it? Please do not do this.
---
I play a gnome and my friend does this every time. "Don't worry guys, it's just a gnome. Nothing of value was lost."
---
He's low key just salty that he can't play a gnome pally ;)
---
The initial mistake Blizz made that could have been corrected with Classic but it wasn't, was not to define faction balance mechanisms. It would be easy to do it setting some rational limits (e.g. 40-60 to 60-40) for the "balanced PvP realms" - could only be a subset of servers with this enabled.
---
And ofc some anti-abuse calculation method, to prevent making 10000 level 1 toons on faction A in order to unlock some additional slots on faction B. I do not have any prescriptive solution how to handle (although a few ideas), but certainly it wouldn't require a regiment of Einsteins to figure out an effective method to control the faction balance.
---
It was a business decision of Blizz not to do this. A bad decision imo.
---
I like Asmon, think he’s a genuinely decent guy that gets way too much shit from people for petty reasons. He’s good at what he does and handles the negativity better than I would for sure. I will admit I don’t enjoy his content as much since McConnell has been more involved, literally every stream he’s a sidekick who seems to purposely try to be an instigator and devil’s advocate, but I still watch sometimes and enjoy the content.
---
Anything else than Classic+ would be rejected by this community, so I'm not sure there's an actual choice from there. Azeroth has tons of places to create content from.
---
What I really don't want are expansions that render anything accomplished before obsolete. I remember entering TBC and seeing greens as good as the best epic from vanilla... this was depressing. 
---
No level increase, no QOL changes, just more content.
---
You see, in classic, a players reputation can make or break them. There is no X realm, so ninja looters and ass holes soon find themselves with no one other than their own. Go to a city, let everyone know what happened through general chat. The response you'll most likely get is 'stfu lul' by some ADHD kid, but the silent majority will start to take note. They do it enough and they get isolated.
---
Block em and move on. And not ALL pugs are cancer like someone else claims.
---
https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/content_plan_pve_and_pvp/
---
Depends if you wanna run dungeons the rest of the way or quest.
---
If you play alliance. Don't play warlock pvp.
---
Your right about solo-warriors.
---
What do you mean rogues are weak in bgs?! Go rogue.
---
Maybe were not greedy pieces of shit tho?
---
just don't join spellcleave groups in the future, you can't expect anything else from them. it's where all the cancer congregates, just avoid it and you'll be fine. there are plenty of reasonable people and groups out there.
---
First time warrior here! Thought I would give tanking a good this time around instead of hunting and its been a great experience....outside of leveling. It feels like I hit a wall at 40 and am sluggishly moving through content. Currently in STV since there was to many cluster mobs in badlands. 
---
Does anyone have any recommended zones, mobs, or dungeons for leveling more efficiently without dying so damn often? Much appreciated!
---
did all servers drop their layers?
---
And you still use the carrot trinket? xD congratz tho on your set items!

As a healer i have joined a group few times, getting whiper from a warrior to join a random dungeon.. only to travel to the instance and ask whos the last dps.. and the answer is, we need a tank.
---
Like geez, i could have farmed/whatever for 2 more hours.. just tank. Let us know that you are out of spec and learning tanking. Everything is still doable and you get to roll the dps gear just same.
---

---
Lower drop rate + best stats for 19 twink clothy = $$
---
Sentry cloak drops from more mobs from more areas. It’s not as vital of a piece of gear. It has farmable viable replacements from dungeons/quest
---
So yeah, with even a slightly healthy twink population it’s very safe to say that it’s worth more than sentry cloak. A lot more.
---
Massive mana cost difference though.
---
yea, I know. Check my main comment. It has the updated file as well as other info.
---
You would think so.  But it seems a lot of people upload Asmongold stuff.
---
I'm a casual player. I dont know what items twinks will pay exorbitant amounts for and I'm to lazy to check everytime something drops (or install addons). If I see a stat increase I like, I'm equipping it, simple as that.
---
They should go to sanitised safespace of pve realms :D
---
Not him, but i share his opinion on this. In my case, my healer is my wife and i am always aware of her mana, and she tells me if my damage intake is too high and i should change to 1H+shield. But she rarely does.
---
It's your game play it how you want, depending on what you want to do endgame. I went resto at 50 and grinded instances for pre raid BIS until I hit 60. My theory was I'm going to be farming this stuff anyways may as well get a head start on it. Once I hit 60 I still had more to farm but had a huge head start.
---
There’s so many mages rn I would go warlock. You don’t have to worry about respecs until late game and since ur new that will take a while. Just pick what you enjoy.
---
This absolutely has to stop. Barring easier solutions the GMs **MUST** give you the opportunity to prove your identity and reactivate. 
---
This is normal procedure when you get locked out for geographic reasons or using different credit cards. Why aren't they doing it?
---
Fuck the army
---
good end game 2h swords for warriors pre raid?
---
what? he gave it to Mcconnel prematurely
---
Ye i have a feeling this will be the case. If things get out of hand in phase 2 and faction balance is at risk i think they will rush BG’s through
---
Kuracmaster hahahah
---
If you ever watch his stream without a preset of emotions like hate or dislike you realize that he is like evey toher streamer out there; talks big to hype stuff up then fails, exaggarte stuff for the sake of entertainment. Most if his hatr is coming from people only seeing black and white about what he says, foe example: "never lose to druids" after wins a few duels, loses once and "lost to druid lulw" gets spammed for days in his chat. And most of his hate is probably from darksouls stream clips on lsf
---
&gt;Out of curiosity, what was the take back from this? ***I can guess but I'd like to know why they actually used that clip.***
---
&gt;&gt;[meowtiger's response]
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;that doesn't answer the question in the slightest
---
Someone give me a proper reason to truly "hate" Asmongold
---
:O 
---
I wonder if there is something alike for the radeon.
---
Some "Explorer's League"
---
For the first 20 levels yes. Afterwards every zone you can level in will be a contested zone.
---
what size would i ask for this to be printed in?
---
I'm not a big fan of asmongold by any means but the guy has thousands of hours of content online and you've watched two videos that im guessing were specifically meant to show him at his worst and you've drawn the amazing conclusion already that he must be an enormous douchebag...

You got what you deserve for helping the enemy.

It's not in their policy. Their policy is you get to show ID and your account gets restored.

This is happening because their CS staff are undertrained and understaffed because Activision doesn't think they're important.

They're important.

At what point does the additive dps of dual wielding become less effective in damage output than a 2h? I understand the idea of skills doing more damage for 2handers which is why 2h is recommended for levelling, but does a 15.5dps 1h and 12.7dps 1h beat a 19.4dps two hander or the other way round? This is for a level 27 arms warrior!
---
P.s. my main hand is a slow 2.8 speed mace with almost comparable damage to the 2h sword that is much faster at 2.1
---
would they resist the fear?
---
Doesnt ele shaman kinda counters them? Tremor totem , purge , silence
---
Thanks god, no human loss.
---
Shaman tanks actually work pretty good for dungeons. Its a nice change as a healer at least. Not that many shamans doing it but the one i had on my last pserver was good.
---
You can literally see 4 guilds with several members in the clip on the corpses, &lt;Zug Zug&gt;, &lt;Washed Up&gt;, &lt;Seems Good&gt;, and &lt;All Purpose Rejects&gt;, along with others.
---
I'm not disputing they got destroyed--they did, but that doesn't mean they weren't organized.
---
There are clips and clips now on Stalagg of ally wiping these BRM stakeouts, the first 3 MC clears of the server were Alliance, and I think the 7 of the 10 top parses for raids are Alliance.
---
Despite the 30:70 split or worse, the Ally guilds are just way better on Stalagg, not even just GRIZZLY here.
---
I don't think that is true. They have value all the way up to 310...
---
No, its not possible at all. It is however possible to avoid highly congested zones, but your friend will be missing tons of quests.
---
&gt; Does not mean I only have 50€
---
Indeed, you have two kidneys!
---
He used recklnessness, so yes
---
How did u get Roth working? I've searched and there wasn't a working classic version, must have it! Plz share link?
---
usually if the warrior is higher lvl than any of the other dps/tank then they end up tanking anyway
---
&gt; WAY before june
---
well it fucking better, p2 brings very little. i'd be fine with p3 in Jan or Feb.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
About only way i can see to sort it out is to either force X number of horde players (and therefore ALL their horde alts) onto low horde pop servers and cease the ability of players to create e.g. horde characters on a server when the horde-alliance ratio dips too far in the favour of horde (and visa versa for alliance dominated servers)
---
To be fair, he probably just wants to turn you into a Burger
---
Well RIP any chance of me getting Runecloth Bag or Runecloth Glove Patterns without paying 70g each.
---
Everyone is at different progression, just join a guild who is still doing earlier raids when new raids releases. Also, almost no raid become obsolete in classic imo.
---
You are right, the huge shift made me pause quite a bit because it could / would mess with people who were already going down the Elemental route :( but ultimately I opted to think ahead to the \~2 years of WoW Classic still ahead of us and all the Shamans who could use a better path..its just more sustainable / better to start getting some Restoration talents once healing dungeons becomes a more serious business in the end game, and this build supports the "frontload -&gt; finish enemies off with melee attacks while regenerating" style better, as well, as you want to constantly fish for Elemental Devastation procs with the Elemental spec, otherwise there was 0 point in going down in it (thus not allowing time for the 5 second rule to kick in).
---
Hello friend, first off, 36 is def half-way to 60 in my opinion, atleast in how it ”feels” to level. Secondly, warlocks are alot like warriors in my opinion, they arent that strong until you reach later levels and dots etc can feel kind of lackluster. Class envy and regret for the class you’ve chosen is a classic vanilla thing because we spend so much time on them therefore we worry. 
---
Warlocks are one of, if not thee best 1v1 class in pvp and also one of the most coveted classes to bring to any raid or dungeon. It takes some preperation, levels and gear tho :) 
---
But if you still feel strongly that it is not a class for you then druid is an option for sure. I just want to point out that getting second thoughts about your class in vanilla is very common and in reality all classes shine in many aspects and no class is inheritly bad.
---
130 for gloves, 230 for pants
---
You should be fine, the original scan from another user is a smaller print size.
---
I can read, but you worded it oddly.
---
Asmongold is a ninja looter and promotes ninja looting
---
Some t1 and t2 pieces are BiS, namely t1 belt and t2 helm and pants.
---
Then you should join the dungeon as a healer
---
No I hate the streamer.
---
It's not that good of a PvP ring at all though..
---
Yeah, I’ll hop back on, just a few days detour.
---
I don't have any strong feeling about the dude but his community definitly suck ass
---
I know it might be easier said than done but you need to brush this off and forget about it. 
---
There's a certain bunch of players that only care about speed and numbers and getting gear and levels as fast as possible. They don't care at all about the game itself, they will never read any quest text, they will never stop to take a screenshot of a great looking sunset or atmospheric forest clearing. They don't care about any of the main characters in the game lore and they will very quickly get all the gear and numbers they want, get bored and then leave the game because they are bored. 
---
Don't waste your time with these people, they are a lost cause, kinda like zombies. In a few months most of them will be gone and mostly we will have people on the servers that actually love the game and enjoy playing it like an RPG.
---
I would almost certainly let people know that i would be rolling on healing gear.  Its weird because not doing it like this would make it so much more difficult to gear my character for raids.
---
Trying to farm out 140g asap for the legs
---
Paid 65 for the gloves
---
No it is not, if a pet kills a mob entirely by itself that mob yields no experience or loot I believe.
---
Im not taking away alliance credit for the win, not my point, any prolly 4-5 guilds had members there, but its different from having 5 guilds trying to stop alliance entering BRM or 4-5 guilds having members togheter forming a raid and they got wiped :)
---
1st phase is the longest, casual players should be on their 20s low 30s, regular people on the 40s. This sub is not a good estimate of casual players.
---
Who is manipulating the Kingsblood market...they know there are mats there are genuinely valuable, right?
---
Thanks, good to hear.
---
I already knew you had no arguments left to support your conclusion, but when you begin trolling, that just confirms it.
---
I won’t bother replying to you again.
---
Grow up, instead of acting like a child whenever you run out of arguments.
---
He’s a normal streamer honestly. About as stupid as the rest. He’s interacts with chat more then anyone that’s why he’s so popular
---
I was in SW and it was so cool to see so many people! Really was alive! But I had to turn down my graphics cuz it was lagwind lol
---

---
You absolutely do not need improved taunt but I play with a bunch of fools who don't know how to manage their own agro so that's a personal choice probs better to go with imp sunder for the rage reduction or get a few extra into defiance maybe?
---
I saw gloves for 80
---
from 1.8
---
 A flight path has been added between [Stormwind](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Stormwind) and [Morgan's Vigil](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Morgan%27s_Vigil).
---
Had more fun on LH than classic so far.
---
2 me
---
That looks so good, do you guys have an Etsy page?
---
Respecing goes up in cost every time you do it and caps at 50. Not a viable option unless you play the AH well and can make bank without much effort.
---
Dont do solo content, stay in instanced content as much as possible.
---
Tank spec in classic as a war really is rough for everything but tanking pve really.
---
Money &gt; player experience
---
I watched one because it was the first result when I looked for wow streamers, and now my recommendations are 100% asmongold.
---
It's as I described, you don't stay online long enough to get lots of exp, it's just for the boss loot.
---
I'm disconnecting by just disabling ethernet in windows
---
I think it's a server lag or spell batching issue, because I generally try to use as much mana, weapon imbue/ totems/ lightning shield/ some healing, before I start drinking. I think if you time things correctly, like a dispel and a lesser/ instant heal, it'll batch the heals onto your last target.
---
If I were you I wouldn't abuse this mechanic to much.
---
I just heard “start at JFK, fly to Dallas, fly to LAX, drive to city through SoCal traffic.”
---
Do you work for American Airlines ?
---
what kind of computer do u have to have a raid fight, recording and not skipping one frame?
---
I never said anything about all loot council's being corrupt, jus the ones that are operating using a majority of "trial members" as their raid team, when there are more trials then regular members the trials are being exploited.
---
I wish.
---
Check my main comment for an updated version.
---
Whats your gear/stats that makes this possible?
---
The more I see the name Asmogold mentioned the less I want to have any idea who he is.
---
I remember watching one once. I forget what it even was about.
---
Just remember it was two girls overreacting. Like crying overacting. Fanning herself with her hand to "keep calm" and what bot. It was by far the cringey thing I've seen in a long time. Now that I think about it it may have been the kh3 trailer wayyy back then.
---
Can confirm. Me and my guild are like 10 people with 2 weeks /played and are barely doing ubrs. We have most prebis gear and are ready for MC but the prospect of filling the group with 75% randoms is just horrendous. Hoping the gm will Form a raid group with different guilds.
---
Is not that complicated. He DC's his alt and kills the boss on his main
---
That's why you watch reaction video? I think you might be in the minority bud. Most people who watch them just think it's fun to see someone's reaction.
---
There are far more enjoyable streamer out there. Asmon is sh*tshow to watch compared to those.
---
LT’s turn with the map at ranger school land man was not one of them, lmao!
---
Well can you explain how I am wrong instead of just insulting me?
---
You are the one who is for blizzard releasing content slower than they did 15 years ago, just to timegate the content being released
---
Could you explain plz ?
---
Yeah... mistake on the upload but check my main comment for an updated version.
---
Whilst fury is pretty good, I'd stick to prot, especially because of hit rating.
---
I even used to agree with most of the shit he used to say but most of his classic WoW arguments were so damn hypocritical that now I can't stand that guy.
---
For PVP?
---
Stratholme both live and undead last bosses drop good swords. Undead one is epic so it's very rare, but live shouldn't be too bad to farm.
---
Talk to the group about it. Often the healer will be a priest, and then you're at least good to roll on leather healer gear.
---
If it’s a stun it won’t. I thought it was another root. Can you shatter from the stun like deep freeze during wrath I wonder. 
---
Kinda hipster I know but it’s piqued my interest.
---
Jesus christ
---
how does this post as humor???
---
Our guild is just a tiny guild for our buddies. As fans of Tim and Eric we are called “Child Clown Outlet” and when we travel anywhere we shout “BUY MY CLOWNS!”
---
just memorize the devilsaur pathing friend
---
You can tank dungeons as non tank spec till about 50.
---
My bro is fury and I'm shadow and we tank/heal instances with 0 issues. That'll prob end at around 55 though.
---
haha thanks for responding for me. many people keep asking my permission. I'm like NOOOO, I don't own this.
---
So, I’m confused, you are a new player but are both excellent at making gold and know enough to extract some art from Roth Ui and make a customized UI with that and other addons?  
---
I mean, congrats but it seems a little suspect that someone playing for 5-6 weeks max is like that.
---
&gt;People were insisting dozens of layers were active, too.
---
**8 is not far away from 12.**
---
was my whole point. i dont have videoproof (duh) but i tested:
---
8 layers at one point
---
and i used:
---
3 layers last week.
---
someone didnt read right and thought i contradicted the blizzard statement with that, wich i dont.
---
i know since i made the claim i have the burdon of proof but i dont have any\^\^
---
how is what im saying "feelcraft"?
---
im not saying i feel like things were like some way. they were and people just dont believe me. wich is fine but some idiots misrepresent my stance to gain some karma or whatever they get out of it.
---
I'm not. You fail (or refuse) to recognise that your blanket solution for BoE items is just as fragile to deliver an unintended result as your opponents. This is inherent in the discussion. Stop trying to deflect arguments by unilaterally deciding "they have nothing to do with it".
---
Moonkins need that innervate for themselves, trust me. For CR? Rarely used. Tanks are stonedand everyone else who dies doesnt really matter much.
---
Eh, during the ddos attacks layering was turned off on skeram and people had no issues playing beside the ddos. Most people were excited in chat to see so many people and that the world felt aljve.
---
Nope, let's take a reading excursion. The topic in question was literally this:
---
&gt;(e.g. warrior needing item with 10 stamina 10 intellect because his item  is only 8 stamina when there is mage and priest in the party ... Guess  who wins the roll everytime this happen)
---
Nowhere was it said this was about cloth. You were the one who introduced 'cloth' to the discussion. I pointed out that not all items are cloth, and some are shared with warriors (rings, amulets, trinkets, belt and cloak to be exact). Then you went on a rant.
---
don't offer work for lower than market price.
---
Hmmmmmm,
---
You're saying that slower weapons make you do more multishot and aimed shot damage?
---
I think you're wrong. What you are saying is that weapon damage is not normalized.
---
Normalized means that aimed shot and multishot use 2.8 as weapon speed.
---
If not, it would mean that the slowest weapons benefit the most from aimed shot and multishot. I specifically remember that it was patched like in 1.10 or so, since the Steelarrow crossbow was better than the epic hunter bow since it added a ton of damage with its 3.4 attack speed.
---
So, dwarven hand cannon...well, it has 2.9 speed, which is nice!
---
However, it's still a bit too fast for your rotation, coming down to like 2.46 with 15% quiver.
---
So you ideally want a slower weapon, up to 3.4 slow if possible.
---
For dwarf, using a hun, you need 6 hit from what I know. So, you might want to use it.
---
There's also the option of flawless arcanite rifle, which is a bit slower, so it might suit you better.
---
Then you get the blackcrow crossbow at 3.2 speed or the stratholme crossobw at 3.3. Those are the hardest hitters and fit the best with your rotation, since you want a weapon with speed as close to aimed shot (3 second), so you don't lose too much attack time on aimed shots.
---
For hit, consider you have voone's vice grips (+2 hit), +1 trinket (horde only), +3 from surefooted, which I advise you spec in until you get some gear, mara ring +1, truestrike shoulders +2, mask of the unforgiven +2. I know some are leather, but they're good still. You can also use a warmonger for +3 hit if you want, losing some stats.
---
So really, if you have that weapon, sell it. If you don't have it and consider buying it, unless you have your epic mount, I'd not buy it. Rhok should be quite easy to get, and it's way better!
---
Hell, I'd advise you to keep using your level 39 sniper rifle, it has 10 less dps, but awesome speed. the dps will noly affect aimed shot damage, so you lose like 30 damage on aimed shot, but you gain a ton from autoshots (3.0 attack speed from 640 ap gets 40 dps -&gt; 120 damage, while 2.8 gets 112).
---
In the end, have fun! I love huntering &lt;3
---
I don't know the percentages on the set, but ye buffs you even more.
---
I started watching recently for Classic and thought it was entertaining. He knows his audience, it's like Jerry Springer. Problem is some of the fans and otherwise seem to take what he says serious. Dude makes bank by having over the top personality and generating fake outrage.
---
Yes, but they can activate when areas are overcrowded too from what I understand.
---
I'm warrior lvl 31, you can hit me up in game if you didn't  finished it yet.

---
Hate is a strong word
---
I love how much light these sub-reddits give him, it's like win-win for asmongold. Free advertising
---
Humor?
---
Wowhead comments say shatter works, so i would say yes.
---
At least he brings his own opinions and insight into it. But yeah it's pretty bs having all these reaction vids all over the place.
---
Yes, most are BiS on twinks. Waste of gold if equipped on a main
---
I am totally not wasting my time at work browsing reddit and researching flight paths............    but hey, it's friday!
---
ahhahah! I didn't make the orignal. Yell at Brady Games. I just fixed up the parts of it.
---
Try to think about this from the perspective of a leveling healer who's still gearing up for his pre-raid BiS gear set **for his role**. Why would he want to join a group where he's healing a guy who might compete on the rolls for +healing gear in a 5man (or 10man, for the matter) group? 
---
If you have very bad healing gear then yes, probably things will be difficult - but everyone has bad gear at some point. Get some greens/crafts/quest rewards suited for healing (int/spi gear is pretty much OK as a start) like many people who level as a DPS/non-heal spec do. I leveled as a DPS spec and healed most dungeons (rolling on healing gear when I did) and split quest/dungeon quest rewards between my DPS spec and healing OS, then I respecced for BRD to full resto with my semi-crap gear and took it from there. Gotta pop a lot of potions when your gear is not up to scratch, but that's just natural. Perhaps ask a guildie to do the tanking and get some high DPS people to come along and speed things on, that will shorten fights and make them less mana intense. Joining a group as one role and rolling on gear for another role will be perceived as greedy, and putting together a group where that happens will probably be quite difficult. I don't know what else to tell you, this is as clear as it can be put.
---
This guy watches reaction videos.
---
Wowhead is grasping at straws, making uneducated guesses - and they're not somehow magically in the know, remember when they got half the database wrong prior to the actual announcement about how loot tables would work? Yeah.  
---
Literally everything else has their 1.12.1 stats, it makes NO sense to give us the retired rare set and also give us the updated insane r12-13 armor sets and r14 weapons that are BiS until Naxxramas.  
---
No chance. We're getting the ilvl 71 sets for sure. It's the logical conclusion.
---
Teebus can only drop from mobs or bosses over level 60 at a ridiculously low rate.
---
Seriously where do you guys get this nonsense.
---
I found CaptainGrim's WoW machinima's after seeing Asmongold watching them. He went from 15K to 70k subs in a few weeks, because of Asmon.
---
Thank you! I've been so confused lately as we started talking about layering. Now we have sharding, phasing, layering...
---
I didn't realise that Battle Shout generated that much aggro, but wouldn't it be possible to make a macro that cancels the Battle Shout buff currently on you and then casts Battle Shout, in cases where you have another warrior with Improved Battle Shout?
---
You know what, I agree.
---
Chances of op success are 33.3333 repeating ofc
---
I was just correcting his 20 man onyxia Statement as a side note 
---
Mechanically it’s not hard 
---
I remember my last heroic raid in retail and I swear it’s just death everywhere and gimmick mechanics and fire and soaking 
---
And grouping but not all 
---
Mobs separating bc otherwise they buff and you die 
---
I like classic bc it’s chill af
---
Ran DM last night with a healer that had never healed a dungeon before
---
He was upfront about it and got guidance from the rest of the group
---
Honesty is generally the best policy 
---
If they are a dick about it then they are not a group you want to run with
---
Gone forever are the time that I was 100% loyal to one game. I actually only played wow for 3 years. From start of vanilla and some good time into BC. And then I think warhammer online came along to drag me away for 3-4 months. 
---
I expect I will take many breaks from classic. In my breaks I will play the other games that I have on rotation, including wow retail. 
---
I have started to get the urge to play swtor again but I will hold off that urge unthil the 22 as their next expansion drops about then etc. 
---
But currently loving it in classic. And my goal is to get 40 and a mount. When I get that I suspect that I will take a break lasting from 1 to 3-4 months.
---
That's not how it works in Vanilla. This isn't retail. Just stop.
---
You play at your own pace, no one should cater to the lowest common denominator. You have Retail for that. Please leave.
---
I honestly don't know... I haven't had that issue with any of the version I've observed.
---
What? I'm on a full pve server and haven't seen a single raiding pug yet. And I no life the shit out of this game and would know if someone posted that in LFG.
---
I thought it was funny that we had this huge drama about ninja looting surrounding Asmon and Royson, then yesterday we had that post about how you should always ninja BoE epics because "gear is just gold lol"
---
One guy gets scammed and now everyone is so paranoid and distrusting. "Roll last, always need, gear is gold and I NEED gold." It's pathetic.
---
I love playing a warlock but hate wearing robes, thankfully I found a tunic (+40 shadow damage) so I could get ride of that damn dress
---
If your healer needs it and you didn't agree beforehand yeah, that will make them very upset, cause them to leave the group and possibly call you out in global chat.
---
Unless they're a priest and you roll on leather gear, in which case everybody should be fine with it (unless you're horde and have that rare ele shaman in your group).
---
Not sure how other druids gear up, because doing dungeons with a healer that has 30 minute CD on revive can be uh, not ideal.
---
Nah man, one was a mount off and the other was from a raid group of his, they weren't to make him look bad I guess. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater of his but I'm not about to look through so many hours of content to better educate myself about this dude.
---
Yeah none of what people are saying makes any sense.  The dude is dead to start off, and accepts the rez as he gets feared.  That's the only thing I can think of that would cause this.
---
No summoning was done though like tf lol.
---
My wife took the pattern and printed it with a cricut
---
I loved to watch asmongolds videos back in MoP, he was really original and actually pretty funny. But once he started streaming he changed completely. 
---
Also, his reactions are so fake, it's like he is watching a video for the 100th time and pretends that it's his first time watching. 
---
"mmokay" "oh okay" "kay" and then he speaks for a bit then it's back to "okay" "uh huh" "yeah ok"
---
nah, i'd rather hate both
---
Dude who's going to do brd/lrbs/urbs when all of BlackRock mountain is going to be one massive tombstone to the dead?
---
Brd especially is going to be camped to high heaven. Every reset will be a corpse run.
---
I did not say it was casual. So you might have a reading peoblem. :)
---
I’ve joined 3 mc pugs already and seen at least 8 guilds advertise pugs, your realm sucks or you log on at really bad times.
---
Standard dick move. Did they want money or something?
---
Exactly. I've listed Asmo as uninterested but still get reuploads of his content. The YouTube algorithm drives me batty
---
Oh I was sure the numbers were white. I may have forgotten though x)
---
Same way Logan Paul does. Literal children.
---
Guess that’s a downvote lol... but what would you like me to set flair to...?
---
ITT: reasons to avoid pugs :D
---
Leeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
Really? explain, but if i wrote I ran a guild for over 2-3 years, recruited, develop strats, did interviews, etc they'd look at me crazy.. but you really do learn some skills that in useful in other fields.
---
I also played a few years of competitve CSGO before getting back into WoW, and a lot of my decision making ( on the fly, ingame ) slowly help in real life.  I always thinking 1-3 steps ahead of what I needed to do, and always anticipated what the people around me were going to do.
---
r/wow and r/wowclassic *
---
If your question isn't ironic or rhetorical, then: [why I watch Asmon](https://youtu.be/KlkzcqY10HE)
---
Unfortunately, I can not edit eh orignal image post, I even ask the Mods. I did not scan it. It was scanned my another reddit hero who I credited in my main comment.
---
Generally his opinions are weird and that made me stop watching a long time ago. Also his followers are obnoxious. He thinks himself as a wow expert and thinks he is better than most people.
---
Lately it was that guy from his guild who ninja looted an epic BoE and Asmon stand on it, is that its fine to ninja from pugs but not from guildies. Well funny thing is its bannable so dont ninja.
---
Why? It’s all an act to get more views
---
There's always a guy in my guild that says, "Bye, I hope you find your dad" when someone leaves.
---
Stupid shit like this made me quit netflix / streaming services altogether and go back to using illegal services. Missing subtitles, dubs and sometimes a whole season between the first and last. It just boggles my mind how gaming companies think they can run business with these garbage tier customer services. Giving them money doesn't necessarily even guarantee the base gameplay one could get for free on some private server.
---
It’s like a disease click on one and youlll never get rid of them 
---
People love the reaction videos 
---
His viewers beg him to stop playing and react to videos 
---
They even begged to let them pay him to watch videos 
---
He has a couple hundred thousand people hostage and they all Stockholm syndrome
---
Why do people camp dungeons entrance? Especially ubrs
---
kick the complainer and invite me instead. its free real expstate
---
Nice baseless bragging there mate. Meanwhile I bet you're just some random neckbeard like the rest of us.
---
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. Correct me if I'm wrong but Are you implying large scale battles lag in classic because of these technologies whereas in vanilla it didn't? I don't think that's true, large numbers of people in a limited area was always laggy. What's interesting here is how did people in their moms basement fix this and Blizzard couldn't? I don't think it's because of money, I think it's somehow related to the entire battle.net architecture and that kind of stuff which these Nostalrious dudes didn't have to confront.
---
[Ye](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/bejeweled-classic/)
---
Uh... hate to break it to you, but spirit is your most important stat while leveling.
---
Man, your issue is starting every fight with zero rage. You should hit just enough sunders to keep the enemies glued to you, no more.
---
Start the pull with pooled rage and burn it for initial threat. Then hit zerker rage to regain some and keep the rage levels steady, only spending when necessary. This way you should end up with +50 rage after the fight. Pop bloodrage to keep yourself in combat to prevent rage bleed during movement and drinks. Rinse and repeat for easy tanking.
---
30 minutes seems a bit excessive, but you should never try to keep them alive. Tell them to stay their distance. If they get into combat, that's entirely on them.
---
Problem is its not the best threat generator so in these fast grps its better to stick with revenge and shield slam for max threat since they die too fast to stack it anyway and theres multiple mobs most of the time.
---
ahhh yeah. the addon thats giving that info is Bagnon, and it just pertains to which of my characters has the item, and where they have it
---
Surely half of them are hate watching.  It's lije step 3 towards becoming Asmon fan boys :)
---
Look into Robe of Power and the Dreamweave items
---
You probably just beccame mature enough not to want to waste your little free time arguing with 15 year old boys about who deserved that blue buff in a ranked game that nobody gives a fuck about.
---
Every DPS increase is “worth it”. Both of your examples are relatively minor upgrades, so if you find yourself struggling to be able to afford expensive ammo, don’t use it. Maybe save it for the last boss if you guys wiped a few times due to lack of DPS.
---
He’s a fuckin gremlin. Ugly fuckin poser
---
I said it only dropped off the dragonkin, that's correct information. Only the elite dragonkin drop the eyes.
---
Lol it's literally just a SS of your character.. and you didn't even show the tunic
---
You will use leather too. Don't be discouraged by armor type. BRD, LBRD/UBRS, Strat, Scholo will be your gearing partner for centuries to come. Also do quests, all of them like in EPL, WPL, BRM related ones. They give exp and when you ding 60 they will give hundreds of gold in total plus lots of gear to choose from - mostly vendorables (but at a nice price) but from time to time a nice upgrade.
---
And whats the deal?
---
Nessek - Horde Mage, who tried to help me with a Blazer boss. Im really worried that he is still sitting there :( damn. And I just tired of deaths and choosed to teleport back home :( Nessek,sorry bro! T\_\_T
---
I main a mage, so I didn’t want a priest because I don’t want to grind 90% of the same items again. So I went for a shaman. So since you wear plate already, why not stick to the priest? If I had rolled alliance I’d have chosen Paladin.
---
Why would Blizzard put multiple layers (world instances) on the same server when they have an option not to? Scale out is always cheaper than scale up.
---
Yes, in your 40s (once you got your mount and start getting spare money), you should look to make a shadoweave/dreamweave set. The former has bonus shadow damage but almost no other stats, while dreamweave has good stats *and* spell healing+damage. Dreamweave can be pricey (like 10g for helmet) but it's absolutely worth and is still good even at lvl 60.
---
You can learn these patterns around 225-250 tailoring level, for alliance the shadoweave trainer is in Stormwind near warlock trainers (bottom left side in the basement of a pub) and dreamweave from the artisan trainer in Theramore. For horde I didn't check but I would imagine it would also be near warlock trainers in org/same place you learn artisan?
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Asmongold.
---
My guild either does “F” or “yay”
---
My chat is then spammed by not only LFG, LookingForGroup, Trade, and General, but now green as well.
---
Hillsbrad is maybe one of my favorite places to level. Then, as a higher level, try to keep alliance honest and not gank all my low level buddies with their high levels.
---
Shh dont tell them.
---
So you ran into some assholes. The internet is full of them.
---
It sucks when people do shit like this, but remember that none of the ugly things he said have anything to do with you, and everything to do with him not wanting to admit his own fuckup.
---
So take a breath, square your shoulders, and walk back in there with your head held high. Though, maybe avoid cleave groups in the future... They seem to attract a lot of assholes.
---
Nah, the amount of people I see in WoW just repeat Asmons opinion from his reaction video is surprisingly high. I understand not everyone does this, but a lot of people do.
---
I hate the people who let him bother them so much that they have to mention his name on this sub every goddamn day.
---
[This goes in depth on it](https://pikach.us/posts/2019-07-16-MisconceptionsSpellHit.html)
---
Worth noting that this isn't all that important to consider in phase 1 as the gearing doesn't really have hard choices with items that give hit vs crit.
---
That’s the whole point homie...  read the title.  I bought a tunic so I don’t have to wear a dress anymore
---
I didn't know Trolls could be Warlocks in Classic!
---
I most certainly have that then :) Thanks for the update!
---
Like movies? Or cartoons? Or porn? Or cinematics in the game?
---
Irrelevant you can get away with it right through to naxx as long as your healers can manage the lack of a shield is not the end of the world just pop stoneskin pots in endgame but early you can tank in dps gear if you really want to but I stack agi for dodge and crit rather than strength for damage and block rating that's basically it
---
Damn you took all the time to write all of this out as fact when ive been having a blast with the game. Maybe classic wow isnt for you dude lol
---
Holy shit, brb - rerolling mage.
---
If you don't like him, just don't like him. I don't see why people have to vocalise their hate for him. It's like he's living in your heads, rent free.
---
Gratz guys! Greetings from &lt;Requiem&gt; ;-)
---
I don't know though how far I agree with you though, I understand where you are coming from but it feels like druids just get shafted for this.  Most dungeon runs I've been in or seen ask for Shaman or Priest healers for the rez.  Tanks are so in demand right now that me joining as a healer would likely be a disservice to my group, since they could find a better healer and may have to spend a long time looking for another tank.  Why would my contribution to the group as a tank not give me the right to roll on the gear that I needed so i could progress forward with my character, this seems like a lot of drama surrounding the briarweed where dps call dibs and get mad when healers roll too.
---
Tbh I think I'll just look for groups that are looking for a tank, tell them I'm rolling on healing gear and if that is a problem I'll just need to find another group.
---
Keep in mind that these stats are a little outdated because Blizzard broke the addon that was used to collect these stats, but it's unlikely that anything changed in a major way.
---
Asmongold made watching someone play retail enjoyable. He can't be that bad.
---
Watching a fake reaction isnt fun, its basically stealing someone else content and just talking over it
---
I use both. And I always make a macro that seaeches in general lfg and world
---
Respeccing at 52 would be rough all you can do is BRD and sunken Temple you can't do the other dungeons until realistically 58. I would highly suggest staying in your levelling spec until you're closer to 58
---
I must have been blackout drunk when I sent that...
---
Yea just way less entertaining and likes to stir up controversy
---
Most people in that camp "Don't watch, don't care for him" now actually kinda hate him, well they are just fed up of seeing his name everywhere when it content doesn't provide much value to them or the community at large
---
Isn't that common in entertainment?
---
Im on a beach and I forgot my sandals, Im gonna out roll you bro
---
You should get a life.
---
I think it's batshit insane to have blind faith in blizzard that they are gonna stick to thier promises but hey maybe that's just me.
---
I watch a lot of stuff that my friends don't watch, plus we're older with families now so we don't see each other as much. It can be nice to get another persons take on what happened during the show. There are a lot of bad reaction videos on youtube, with over the top reactions which are clearly hamming it up for the camera but there are a few good channels that have some decent insight and discussion about the shows they watch.
---
Hehe nice! Sooner or l8r you'll have to though :D
---
This a solid argument. Also agree pvp system should have been implemented since release.
---
I'm happy to throw someone struggling with a bad pull an ambush and a couple backstabs.
---
I loved it up until people wanted me to heal every dungeon i did, quested for the most part. Stacking spirit with spirit tap is very nice.
---
I actually lvled slower in a 2man group then solo because i didnt get last hits 100% of the time. Taking 1-2 mobs at level 35 with vampiric embrace is a way to keep your mana flowing and keep you at a steady 90% health. Can definetly recommend it!
---
Just watch it yourself and have your own reaction. Then later on watch his, then you wont just be copying his reaction and you'll be one step closer to having your own personality.
---
Yeah your second paragraph is my main worry.  I am hybrid specced so I have a few healing resto talents, but yea its mostly the rez that concerns me.
---
by that logic, even if it's a BOP i should roll need, because i need the 4 gold from vendoring the item
---
Exactly this, I'm just sat here like who the hell is asmondgold?
---
Of course it is. Everyone on youtube is trying to get more views lol
---
I mean if you don’t care if half the stuff he talks about and all his reactions are bs
---
We type "F" when people leave. We also encourage people to type "DING" as most of us migrated from a guild where the Guild leader had started kicking people for typing "DING"
---
His popularity sky rocketed when he decided to shit on blizzard for little to no reason. So when he noticed bitching gave him views he bacily started just saying shit that sounds like  it's thought through but is really just hot air... Other than that he backpeddles on statements he has made, his friends on his stream are like the most awful people ever, and over half his content is non content made from the fact that he has a lot of views. It's cheap, annoying, weird as fuck and has very little to do with wow even when he is playing wow. I could go on...
---
Wait Blizzard are not greedy?
---
people want the easy way out
---
if you were a "pvper" who wanted less challenge and just safe pvp to get honor in p2, you would go to a server with plenty of population but is also your side dominated.
---
If you were a raider, you'd want to join a more populated realm with your faction.
---
Rarely do people want to volunteerly join an empty realm that has your faction being outnumbered.
---
Look at retail, for the more hardcore servers (IE they are trying to progress) they are almost always one side dominated with plenty of players https://www.wowprogress.com/realms/rank/us this is what happens when you open up character xfer and these kinds of stats is easily gotten (number of guilds progressing in mythic). People pile on to get easy shit, not to make it harder for themselves.
---
Has anyone had success farming eyes of shadow? I'm a little short on gold after getting my mount+truefaith and thought I'd try to farm it instead of buying one, but after a couple hours of killing succubi in winterspring I'm thinking it wasn't the greatest idea (after all, they wouldn't cost 200g+ if it was that easy). I also can only kill the succubi by LOSing their casts, the felguards and dogs absolutely destroy me so I have to be super careful there.
---
He usually repeats everything twice
---
Warlock vs warrior/hunter tips? Especially warrior, I dont really understand the class. How does the fear immune thing work for warriors and hunter pets?
---
Pops a 30min CD to attack an unstealthed rogue 4 Levels below and a holypriest who probably hadn´t any Intention to fight in the first place, and goes to reddit to brag. When will you release your PVP Clip with a black and white intro to Linkin Park tracks?
---
pathetic
---
I mean ... why Hate Asmongold?
---
i love him. He's like a Shepard for all the idiots i would never want to play with. He watches over his flock and keeps them in once concentrated place ...... that i can avoid like the plague. Because at least with him, they are all quarantined on one server instead of spreading to the others.
---
So i say thank you Asmongold, be a good Shepard and keep your flock well tended and well watched. Keep them away from the rest of the playerbase far far .... very very far away.
---
If only we could get all guilds to meet like this, maybe raids would good smoother xD
---
I'd literally always take a priest over a hunter or rogue. 
---
Less competition for gear and a dps that can ress, beautiful.
---
Remember when regular instances were hard enough that you had to do crowd control, wait for the healer to get mana before pulling again, and watch your threat as DPS or you'd wipe?
---
r/emojipolice halt! you have  used illegal emojis  you must only use state approved  emotes like”:D :P :) :(  XD”  if you commit such a crime again i’ll have you in jail i am confiscating these emojis
---
&gt;I'd argue that the vast majority doesn't really care one way or the other.
---
But that is definition of "not hating" just a lack of response.
---
The base emotion towards someone is to not hate them, since you have no reason to.
---
So the statement is actually true that the vast majority doesnt hate him, since the vast majority doesnt even know anything about him and therefore doesnt feel one way or another as you suggested.
---
&gt;promoted ninja looting
---
&gt;Not understanding sarcasm
---
I dunno, if it was like “I GET STABBED IN THE FACE - Crazy Reaction” I would watch that.
---
This changes everything, thanks !
---
Yeah everyone have problems with their isp. Everyone that plays wow. Makes sense.
---
Before you say I don’t. Have you raided a major capital yet?
---
I will never understand peoples urge to "watch" someone play a game.  I much prefer actually playing the damn thing, I guess I'm old fashioned...
---
That's my big issue, youtube keeps recommending me him reacting to stuff. I don't watch him, I'm not subbed, and I've never searched for him. 
---
I look up one shaman leveling guide, and suddenly youtube thinks I want my feed to be nothing but that annoying dumbass reacting to stuff.
---
So, It's common to swap from Gnomish to Goblin engineering, and then you get put to 0 engineering.
---
Is it worth saving blues from BRD/LBRS/UBRS, then disenchant them all when i respec engi?
---
We’ve known that’s been a lie for a while now though. Blizzard legit called it out as a lie a while back. 
---
What is funny is just yesterday people on Herod were claiming that some people, without realizing they we’ve been on 2 layers for at least 10+  now,  that people were committing large later exploits. People will lie about anything tbh.
---
Is there a decent guide for playing in dungeons as a mage? Or just some general tips? I never played a mage back in the day and I really enjoy the play style (I'm level 20) but I really don't wanna be one of "those" mages.
---
DO IT!
---
God damnit now I have to spend massive amounts of money again. How much is it?
---
Once you get to sholo  /DM you can easily cause a wipe if you pull while a  none raid geared healer is drinking.
---
Well I hate the people who hate the people! Wait ugh.. Yeah it's all pretty stupid isn't it. Yeah it would be nice if the youtube algorithm would actually learn I don't want to see 900 asmon videos by as many channels.. but it's not his fault.
---
Ive never approved more of my tax dollars. You go team!
---
&gt;good channels that have some decent insight and discussion about the shows they watch.
---
Yeah, that is called a review. There are no good reaction videos.
---
They cost you your pug. They should be hung, drowned and quartered. Emasculated, eviscerated and have their bowels burnt before them, beheaded and cut into 4 parts sent to the corners of the realm.... 
---
(I was reading up on William Wallace recently).
---
That and they recently got rid of the "I'm not interested in this channel" option... I mean it never really worked anyway, but it gave me a rage option to hit.
---
I used to not like the idea of watching a streamer. Then I did one day, (different game, not asmon) 5 minutes watching is enough to curb my burnout, and go back to playing. 
---
Sorry streamers, watching your boring gameplay makes me want to play more. And no I will not surrport you. More power to those that do.
---
Even watched a couple of streamers play a game I was interested in, helped me decide not to buy. Fortnite for example. God I thought warcraft was cartoony. Apex, better visually, but still dull for 3/4 of a match. I think the genre does nothing for me.
---
Just letting you know what you can do if you just know what your doing in the game. My goals are to raid and clear content so I set myself up for that. 
---
I'm busy during my school terms so I knew I had to knock it out during my fall break. Trying to show that you can have neckbeard results with a short initial hardcore time investment. Cause now I can play and do the things I wanna do at my own pace. I just started a term in school so I don't have a lot of time anymore. But that's okay cause I can fit in an hour for MC and ony easy in my week now.
---
You can DW tank trash in e.g. Scholo without raid gear? (I read your reply as a yes, but my warrior is only 21, can't try it just yet. :-)
---
True true.  But still I’m tryna see these orc tree trunk legs.  Homie doesn’t skip leg day
---
yea I kinda did already for 90% of it :p
---
Weird how it seems that "everybody" hates Asmongold here, but every other day the top post on the sub is about Asmongold... 
---
This post isn't even funny or original. Can we just tag Asmongold hate so we can filter it out?
---
Redditors rather than players. Dude still get like 25k viewers for some fuckin reason.
---
&gt;Human Resources Command
---
Why do I find this combination of words to be oddly amusing?
---
Why would you hate asmongold?
---
I played holy pally back in vanilla, and up until Legion, wanted to try and change things up again. I was considering it again, but warrior has been SUCH a grind, idk if I could put myself through a similar grind.
---
Good good.
---
Let the procrastination flow through you
---
that came with wotlk
---
It got more confusing when they added a layer hop cooldown, so you could invite someone and still not see them if they switched layers recently.
---
Just because i like raiding doesnt mean i want to subject myself to a shit game in every other aspect.
---
I like watching some reaction videos, like black people who have only ever listened to rap listening to old country music and finding out it's kinda neat.
---
if you think people wont still be farming MC and ony when naxx is out you are very wrong
---
Only BM hunters can stop the fear on their pets, all other hunters can't avoid that unless they specifically put points into shadow resistance.
---
U went from 58 to 60 in t
---
Stratholme in like 4-6 hours.
---
Unpopular opinion, I think he's funny af. But I haven't really watched his stream lately so I wouldn't know what's going on.
---
Fuck this shit I love Asmon and I sub to his channel on twitch. I really don’t get Reddit’s toxicity to him.
---
I think Feralas is just more horde heavy in general, it's *really* out of the way for alliance. And the quest hub is on a freaking island.
---
I play WoW while I watch Asmongold on my second monitor and because I like it for the background noise.
---
It's almost like you are playing with other people who also want to enjoy and talk about the game you are playing and when playing wow classic there's a lot of travel time where it's nice to see something happening on the 2nd monitor.
---
I watched an old DBZ video once and my god the shit that started showing up on my recommended sweet lord.
---
Can you post a link to that addon? I'm using the twitch app but I do not like it and I'm too stupid to find what you're talking about.
---
they have absolutely no customer support. Their default policy seems to be "no", no matter the request
---
Oooohhh!
---
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about asmongold. u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol.
---
I normally do but they stopped playing classic to play Borderlands 3.
---
I've never liked the game so I'm stuck in classic and pugs now.
---
I remember Asmon gathering I think it was 4 full raids in either late Legion or early BFA and heading to Org and the game just shit on itself. 
---
It's like WPvP stopped being a thing years ago for the most part so Blizz decided to stop trying to account for it.
---
I tank with 32, 5, 15 right now. I can stance dance and still play 2h solo, but also get the shield block and threat benefits of prot. It's not cookie cutter, but I'm not in the highest tiers of raiding it works well for me.
---
I'll probably switch to furyprot if and when I get better gear for it.
---
The schedule isnt bad though i feel like it'd have been better to combine p1 and p2. Then make that phase last significantly longer
---
&gt;The reason I don't play a tank in classic is because I tanked in vanilla. You're expected to know EVERYTHING, and to be good, you have to.
---
Tanking is nowadays a lot more in depths, in classic there's not a lot to know.
---
found the 60 dwarf priest
---
Maybe add additional filters on Top of the game like reshade or nvidia's inbuilt filters.
---
Prices atm are so dumb. Why would people pay so much for this when the content is so easy anyway...
---
Shit yeah it Will last till UBRS.  Add the trinket from hinterlands and youll feel hit capped like a god-king sir.   DO IT! 
---
Tank with 2h!  Sweeping cleave whirlwind. Who gon’ do more threat or damage???
---
That's still a lot of availability. Basically means you are dedicated to play outside of school/work. I'm guessing most players that return to vanilla since they first played it are in a position in their lives now where they can't afford to do that.
---
Because I felt like it?
---
ubrs most ppl are waiting for group to form, jed id to find or until its their turn to get buffed.
---
His demographics show the overwhelming majority of his audience is over 18. Just because you're utterly humorless doesn't mean others automatically must be children.
---
JesusChristItsJasonBourne.png
---
Alliance?
---
I'm on Dreadmist alliance, only 32 though but friends are always welcome
---
Sweet
---
I just tested this with all shaman heals. if you select a target and start casting a heal within a 0.0- 0.5 seconds window (rough estimate since I don't have a stopwatch addon that shows fractions of a second), the heal will go off on your last target.
---
And he's so toxic.  Even if it's just a character and he doesn't really feel that way, pretending to validates all the other toxic people and makes the community as a whole worse.
---
2which trinket is that???
---
And that's the day you found a waifu.
---
Because these posts are a joke.
---
I’m more interested in gimmick builds than min maxing right now. I’m yet to get Thrash Blade or Ironfoe, but how would it work with sword specialisation + windfury?
---
I’m assuming there is an internal CD on the additional weapon procs, but what can proc off what? 
---
My guess is windfury can proc off any attack.
---
Sword spec will proc off main swings and not additional swing. IE thrash blades additional attack cannot proc sword specialisation, but can proc WF?
---
Ironfoe only procs off Itself and WF.
---
&gt; The fact that people played years and years on private servers proves it
---
Yeah because their characters kept on getting deleted when the bootleg servers got C&amp;D'd lol
---
Yeah, thought as much, it's virtually impossible to police in this day and age. Every server has a Discord with both factions constantly communicating, not to mention Twitch.
---
It let you farm the same area twice, basically. Not a huge deal because with the increased population, most farming spots had more people than you'd normally encounter there anyway. There was a bug where you could layer inside instances and basically farm any boss endlessly without having to clear, but that was patched out quickly and offenders banned.
---
Whats the drama now?
---
I think you should stop and think about why you feel the need to write THIS.
---
I've just had like my first run with a mage in the group in brd the other night. Been avoiding them since my buddy plays a warlock and I'm the tank so we just never invited any ^^ dps is easy to find anyway
---
the sens of a pvp realm, or?
---
You make it sound like that's a bad thing
---
My guild always spams Whale Cum!
---
Just as your told to go back across the world for the fifth time, the devs should have made that female orc shaman emote:
---
“Where is your God now?”
---
Guard Captain something.  Its from the elite quests in Hinterlands!  Youll probably get it late 40s. Think i did it at 47.   
---
Its like 30ap and 1% hit.
---
That looks pretty stacked, even though I disagree with using Feet of the Lynx over Trailblazer Boots.
---
For me personally, the idea of getting AGM ever again obnoxious enough that I will probably skip 19s for the most part this time around except maybe 1 or 2 of the C-Tier classes to fool around with. 
---
I'll be trying out something new and will play 29s and 49s for the most part.
---
Seriously
---
You can find a-holes in any role.  But lets pigeon hole the DPS....  Regardless I agree with one thing Dr. Phil has ever said.....  "People treat you the way you let them treat you..."   If you end up in a group full of a-holes hit the road...  Especially as a tank, you will probably be hit up for another run immediately anyway...
---
Asmongold is a piece of shit with a dumb face and he's driving a douche Mustang.
---
DKs probably need some tweaks because it is rife for griefing. You could party with someone, they DK and you get tagged as well and whoops, there goes a week of honor farming down the drain. 
---
I'm all for the main purpose of them (questgivers, flightmasters, etc) but it probably needs to be changed a little to account for some things.
---
When tanking, do you look for a faster weapon for more hits/rage generation? Never played warrior in vanilla until now.
---
Where's his 50k twitch fans? I don't hate him and id be most his viewers don't either
---
Speedrunning is interesting, people have accounts in certain games I would never get close to so seeing them play is interesting, some people are really good at games I play and watching the pros can be entertaining, and some streamers are actually entertaining to watch.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I think he’s entertaining.
---
It’s like a sitcom based out of wow. I don’t watch the streams but some clips here and there on YouTube.
---
You don’t have to respect and agree with someone in order to find their content entertaining.
---
Yeah I watched a few reaction videos and then I kind of realised 90% of the time is just yup and uh-huh and I'm like why am I watching this rather than just the original video... 
---
Also, reaction videos should get a LOT more hate they basically leech revenue from content creators.
---
You’re not missing anything
---
Lol we actually do the same
---
&gt;  full wipe / Pantheon system
---
Maybe it's just me but I genuinely wouldn't play anymore if they had that system. That's way too much effort just gone.
---
Nearing 60 on my warrior, played one in Vanilla with a progression guild back in the day. Do you think prot is required on anything  below MC? 
---
I'd really just like to stay Arms for PVP but still be a viable tank in pre raid content when needed. If I decide to hit raiding hard I'd definitely be prot.
---
May I see your talent tree?
---
I dont hate him :/
---
Ive yet to watch a single one but they keep popping up on my youtube sidebar. I dont get it.
---
What's fake about it? Sure, he might overreact to certain things, but he also regularly pauses the video to provide his own opinion and insight on the matter. It's not just him sitting there watching the video while making faces; he gives his own point of view as well. And the people whose content he's "stealing" sure don't seem to mind much, because they regularly reference him in their videos (and not in a bad way), and even appear on Discord on his stream. It's huge exposure for their channels, you can't ignore that.
---
Sweet found it, I can do it next level! Cheers man I'll buy it tonight and do that
---
just ghost run its fine
---
Faster better
---
True you grab the Shaman for Totems and BL if Shaman is top dps then he is overgered or dps are slacking
---
Resort to calling names. He has really got you lot on farm 😂
---
Felsteed
---
😩
---
Happy chopchop-ing.  Lunch is over. Zugzug.
---
Honestly, I didn’t know about the dude until I followed this subreddit and saw all the hate posts about him. Went to check him out and yea he’s super narcissistic but I kinda enjoy watching his streams now simply for the classic gameplay. I don’t think you guys understand how much you’re helping him get viewers by posting this hate stuff about him.
---
Fair enough
---
Use the transfers blizzard offered?
---
Farming Reddit spergs endlessly
---
Still only level 40.
---
The staff is pretty good even for 60
---
The poll had around 30,000 replies, I believe.
---
As a previous hardcore WoW player, anything less than 12hr a day feels casual.
---
Im really trying to enjoy myself, but being the one who inspects people rather than the one being inspected is hard.
---
I hate the haters more. Don’t see any pro asmon posts.
---
*tink tink*
---
get a druid tank and everything is fine? ;)
---
This is my thinking, currently the big wave of players who started at launch are hitting Dark Whelpling level so prices have tanked.
---
For your herbs, I recommend making a bank alt or two (or four) for keeping stuff that's selling far too cheap now and then flip it for some profit when more people start leveling alts and the economy stabilizes. Easy way to empty your bags while questing too, just mailing it all off to your bank character.
---
Wait till you get to MC.
---
..and more threat generation..
---
..and cheaper sunder...
---
..and revenge stun for 3s..
---
..and 10% more armor..
---
..and a skill that just pops 30% more HP to you on demand..
---
Yeah not worth it at all if you can get HURRRRRR DAMAAGGE!!!
---
but your wife's boyfriend plays on Herod
---
Except 95% of wpvp is what everyone in this thread is saying: camping flight paths and mobbing anyone who lands.
---
You know what kills wpvp? People leaving the game because they can't get anything done.
---
If its in your advertisement reserve what ever you want, people may never join but you can definitly reserve.
---
All subs are circle jerks and echo chambers, is this your first week on reddit?
---
Have you been playing warriors before classic?  I ask because playing without tactical mastery sounds like the most demanding and high skill ceiling playstyle, especially when you're still getting comfortable with some dungeons, mobs and layouts, I feel like this would be a recipe for disaster with less experienced players or am I making too big a deal of it?
---
"Both Reddit communities"
---
I've never said that I have a problem with their current release schedule, even if I personally am a part of the top &lt;1%. I am in no way advocating for content to be released for people like me. I just dont think having phase 1 take a year is reasonable either, just because there are people who are not 60 yet on any characters. That would not be vanilla.
---
My problem was with people saying that even this is too fast and that the phase releases should for some reason be even slower than they were 15 years ago when people were really bad at the game. 
---
They want Blizzard to timegate the content for the sake of casuals instead of releasing the content in a true to vanilla way. That was my problem. If you want timegated content you can go play BFA.
---
Also don't worry about me enjoying the game or having fun. Despite what people in this subreddit think you can absolutely still have fun even if you are playing efficiently or 12 hours a day. For some people, like me, that's the fun way to play and I am having a blast.
---
Yup, I know. But if Phase 2 was tomorrow it would set the expectation of Phase 3 in December.
---
&gt; standing on the shoulders of their fans
---
Lol name a celebrity that *doesn't* do that and why it's a bad thing. Don't you have to "stand on the shoulders" of fans in order to be a streamer in the first place?
---
is this arugal?
---
Maybe for UBRS, a 5-man can be tanked without problems as Arms.
---
why do you give a shit about what some other neckbeard thinks, just watch it and make your own opinion, that is what adults do
---
There was bug where reck/crits couldn't hit through PWS. I hope its fixed now.
---
But it’s still not entertaining. I watch some people but the reaction videos suck. 
---
“Watch this person watch a video! a AMAZING!”
---
Exactly this, it just has to be someone I find entertaining and think has interesting opinions.  Just because you find someones opinions interesting doesn't mean you have to agree with them.
---
I love it, great idea :o
---
Best comment with the most sound logic. 100% agree mate.
---
Ours descended into a long line of whalecum. It's just to let the new guy know what sort of guild he's in.
---

---
Technically, it's proof that there is only one "true" gender ;P
---
Manchildren
---
I sort of don't want to be that person or get a reputation for being like that. But yeah if I set out the terms and people are fine it with then everyone should be happy.
---
I added you! I have some time now if you do as well? Im already in SFK! If you dont have time we'll plan a later moment if that's okay for you? Much appreciated in any case!
---
Pretty standard for tanks to reserve an item of decent value if they need nothing from a dungeon. They struggle to farm so this is monetizing a niche they can fill that has demand
---
 Keep in mind the expectation is a smooth run when you do this.
---
I'm generally not a big fan of this whole thing with reserving drops.
---
But on the other hand ... people can be waiting for hours for a tank, and if it's announced up front and they agree - then fine.
---
You seem to be in the minority bud.
---
Sounds like you got a case of *Asmongold Derangement Syndrome.*
---
So youre telling me i dont have to continuously spout my hate for someone like it matters?
---
Its not a must but I want to start making gold to try and buy it. Would like to have it by at least 42.
---
You can also tempt them with killing [Ribbly Screwspigot](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=9543/ribbly-screwspigot) and his gang in the bar for a chance to drop 16-slot bag.
---
It's not that you are automatically a good walker just because you have 2 Legs. In a wheelchair race you can shine with one leg if you are always prepared. I've seen plenty of people that are supposed to do well on walkways failing to people with limps and using canes just because they suck.
---
Your general opinion on this just doesn't apply anymore. Welcome to 2019 where people can convince themselves content was a lot harder 15 years ago. Let them prove it before you falsely accuse them what seemed to be true 15 years ago.
---
Hi guys!
---
Please, help me decide, should i choose warrior or druid. I really like tanking and it's the most interesting role in pve for me. I also enjoy variety and utility that druid provides.
---
How do I delete someone else's comment
---
Druids tend not to be main tank in high end raids, but rather off-tank. However other than that they can cover all content. If you want to play one, I absolutely would.
---
Nope. I actually made a thread about this and was suggested by other redditors and a speed booster video that holy is better before 40. I didnt believe them still and got mindflay level 2 and saw how pathetic it was which finally convinced me.
---
The issue is the early shadow talents just aren't very good at all except for spirit tap. And since you get holy fire for free now, it's actually better to spec it until you get your damage talents. 
---
What you do is you put 5 points into spirit tap, 5 points into wands and maybe 3 more into shield. Then you go into holy and get the cast time talents and finally the damage talents at 35-40. You then respec at about 46 to keep the shield talent on disc and have shadowform but you can respec at 41 if you're impatient.
---
Why do you lot keep saying "unpopular opinion". Reddits opinion is the unpopular one, look at his view count.
---
Cross that bridge as you approach it though. If you're finding people complain, or take issue with it, you can stop and find another strategy.
---
Is it just for the leather or do they drop good items too?
---
I've only briefly watched a video or two from him but my retail gm used to watch him and said he'd do shit like beg for loot and basically just try to make it so he gets everything. Just sounds like a piece of shit.
---
Same with "lost in vegas", hiphoppers digging into metal. (imo, they were better before they went to a "better" more high tech setup)
---
I think he means deep prot brings nothing on the table in terms of mitigation.

With Narga, there probably isnt that much touched up.  In her IG you can see her just standing in a bathroom in the costume as well as a video and it looks pretty much the same.  Narga's attention to detail is pretty insane.  Most of her stuff looks amazing.
---
There\`s a ton of Kingsblood around. And now everyone and theirgrandma will start farming it.
---
A chat log of someone being mad on wow, that's not something we see literally every day.
---
As long as you make the roll rules clear while forming the group you can reserve whatever you like.
---
Also 5 percent pleasure!
---
According to some people it is still funny...
---
I’d wager 70%+ of leveling priests are shadow anyway, honestly it’s very easy to heal regardless of spec as priest.
---
Lol I'm one of them. I'm brand new to WoW and had to go three days without internet while I was moving and couldn't level q.q I watched so many vids about WoW history and tips and lots of them were reaction vids where Asmon added his own commentary. I'm annoyed with Asmon after seeing him ninja from his own guild when they did their first 20 man onnyxia raid, but all the reaction vids were cool to watch.
---
There isn't one.
---
As you can see they dont need any tanks.
---
100k viewers
---
So they worth ~1% hit chance for orcs/humans + 10% glancing blow reduction. That is definitely not negligible. As soon as you are done with the devilsaur set it might be worth it no?
---
Having your rez on a 30m cooldown is a pain in the ass while healing dungeons. That's the only downside of playing a Druid healer.
---
People can like him if they want.  Lots of people have bad taste.
---
But I think he looks and acts weird and I will not be surprised when he is arrested as a serial killer.
---
&gt;I sort of don't want to be that person or get a reputation for being like that. 
---
Kinda answering your own question.
---
Can't really compare a show done by professionals with a dude sitting in his loft talking into a webcam.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Yeee essence of fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
He’s just successful and not that good at the game and people are salty bitches pretty much
---
Are you ok bro? Anything you want to get off your chest?
---
Well from 40+ your gold intake naturally jumps up a bit just doing dungeons and quests, censoring rewards so you shouldn't have a problem
---
Leveling is a pie chart between three things: damage, downtime, and travel time. Increasing your efficiency in any of these is really important for leveling (more DPS, more mana per 5/spirit, more movement speed), and at level 40 increasing your movement speed by +60% sometimes is huge.
---
I'll start out by saying that reserving items in general is just a ridiculously greedy thing to do considering 5 people will be taking part and putting effort into clearing whatever dungeon. That should result in equal chance at reward.
---
With the semi-negative part out of the way, it is your gaming experience. If you capitalize on the limited availability of tanks by monetizing your time and effort, then thats your right. If you advertise your price, and it is accepted, then there is no harm, as long as your intentions are clear.
---
You do you, boo. Being a tank is expensive af.
---
Or use for once your brain and kite or bandage yourself when you don't have aggro.. I run ZF from 43-52 mostly with melee cleave groups and most warris had absolutely no awareness about my manapool. Its just charge, cleave, wait for ravanger proc and look at the big yellow numbers.
---
For the gear and gold part. I dont get the hate on that one. Every does what they want with their stuff. If i give away my gold than that my decision. If he gets the loot he want and everyone in the group okay with that whats the problem ? I get not everyone likes his acting on the camera but thats just stupid in my opinion. Cdew getting the same comment because people helped him with Sulfuras and he doesnt even accept gold after that and before that. He farms ores just like an average player yet people calling him out. Its just envy.
---
Im on my way to work atm, i'll post mine when im back home. Dont worry
---
&gt;Seems insane to have 4months of no BG's after the honor system releases. They're going to kill off a lot of casual players doing that because people aren't going to deal with being camped at a flight path for 4months
---
I can't see that being a massive problem. You don't get HK for killing someone who are not within 10 levels of you. Introducing the Honor system can help with the lvl 60 players ganking people level 40 and below.
---
Yes, the final 10 levels can be tough, but introducing the Honor System will probably help the casual levelers (until they reach level 50)
---
What I find, is that a lot of current 60s, like to go to lower level zones to get their power kick, because once the targets are around level 40, they have enough of their class kit to be a potential threat if a couple of them gang up on one 60.
---
We might also see the return of Tarren Mill vs Southshore as the unofficial BG.
---
It’s not really a status thing, but more of a massive quality of life boost. I’m leveling my first alt and it’s painful not having my epic mount, let a regular mount. You just get used to the speed.
---
Yeez this brings back memories from my school days where someone got mad and literally waited outside with a group to fight one dude 😂
---
As long as you state your demands before you start the dungeon you can make any demands you want. If people doesn't agree then they can join another group. But if you make your demand when everyone has gathered at Stratholme and are ready to begin then it is kind of an asshole move. I would gladly give up one orb (I would probably agree to giving the tank all orbs) to have a good tank for the run.
---

He turned into an insufferable dickhead when he started dating that Thott who flaunts her tits about on camera
---
&gt; I am curious if there are any specific dungeons that my Warrior can solo that would be beneficial to my Druid?  
---
It's not worth. You are looking for specific BoE blue items, but their chance is so low, that you better spend this time leveling as druid.  
---
Also druid is one of the classes that don't rely on weapon, so gear have very low effect on them. For cat your weapon is just stat-stick.  
---
Buy\craft bunch of agi\str elixirs, send to your druid, buy/craft some green leather pieces - and just play as usual.
---
charging to stun casters, taunting chasers and put in passing damage from a passing swing
---
Not really, since I've seen quite a few people doing it and I personally don't mind them doing so. If they're going through the effort of making the group, tanking etc then it seems fair. 
---
However there often appears to be some salty people in world saying "LUL RESERV".
---
If you really have a problem with this,  then farm kingsblood.
---
Tauren, and yes switching to fury at 60
---
The odds of winning the encounter are low in general but not impossible.  20 levels for physical damage against a player isn't as high as you think.  It is doable.  I've beaten a level 40 warrior as a 20 hunter before.  It's just a matter of not making any mistakes.

dont buy anything off the ah and craft bandages and vendor them and yeah sell a heap of skin

whats DW ?
---
Yes sharding is designed to optimize performance, alleviating "pressure" by moving people between the shards. But it is also designed to try to keep people in the same raid within the same shard. The game obviously supports raid vs raid (in the sense that they even let you do it) and it was always a thing in the game. So I don't think "Blizzard loves money so they refuse to fix this feature" is a good argument. We KNOW they don't like too many people descending on the same zone. The question is, where is the limit? What's the "intended" pvp raid vs raid size?
---
What is your class? i’m new too but feel i’m picking it up quickly
---
Yeah I'm not there for the gear, which presumably all the other members would be.
---
If you make the group and find people who will accept your loot terms, it's reasonable. I tank as well and it can get to be expensive at times IMO. The only etiquette issues would be if you didn't tell them your loot expectation or deceived them. 
---
Generally speaking, it is most often considered each player's own responsibility to bring food, potions, and consumables at own expense for PUGs. Structured guilds may have loot rules to cover this type of expense and if you aren't already in one, consider finding a guild like this.
---
Lmao you're literally clueless, you have 0 idea about what you're talking about.
---
Sometimes a broken compass can lead you north.
---
Or xp or both. I think asking for something is reasonable. I would even go so far as to ask for all things other people odnt need in scholo, as it has nothing for most tanks.
---
Thanks ;) with shipment to other UE country 110 euro. Other countries - we need to check. But we could make some other stuff too. Just saying ;) check us out on FB @szklonawarsztacie ;)
---
Yea like if a shooter came into your workplace with a full buy and you were still on pistol round. Gotta have a plan of attack for that one.
---
I do this quite regularly.
---
The market is saturated with people undercutting each other so often that the price of items can massively fluctuate over the course of a day.
---
As long as you don't get greedy with the resale cost you can make a decent amount of money.
---
Lol okay you show me a capped toon with /played 30 mins and it’s 420-430 :)
---
No, I don't see anyone doing Naxx pug. You need a roster of people in t2, as someone that was in a guild that got stuck on the third boss.
---
Theres no way pugs can do Naxx. Theres no way you can get a full roster of 40 people with t2 in a pug.
---
Yeah people stop going into BRM to raid ?!
---
If I'm working on quests or gear and a tank just wants the first orb, I can't click invite fast enough.  There are so many groups that need tanks and aren't looking for crafting materials, I don't mind a heavily geared tank who knows what he is doing getting paid for his troubles.
---
&gt; And Tier 13, which had the infamous LFR loot exploit
---
The only "loot exploit" I remember doing at that time was filling the raid with 22 alts and 3 mains (for the 3 different tier tokens) and just running it over and over again, cycling through alts and 3 mains in order to funnel all the gear drops into those 3 mains. That was considered an exploit?
---
So I (55 Hunter) ran BRD for the first time yesterday. After killing Angerforge, HoJ dropped. From the guides I’ve read online that is one of hunter BiS trinkets pre-raid. I hit need.
---
The warrior in my group went full tilt and whispered me for about an hour telling me how retarded I am and that it’s only a melee trinket. (I did learn after that it’s BiS forever for Melee).
---
I feel bad but just wanted to see if I really fucked up that bad or if this guy was being unreasonable in assuming I wouldn’t try to get my BiS gear as well. 
---
For context it was a PUG, not a guild run and no item reservations.
---
Feel free to let me know if I’m a huntard piece of shit.
---
Those pservers has peaks of 12k and min pops at 6k. Theys mins are classic servers peaks and that's without layering.
---
Kinda wish ZG was in phase 2 rather than 4. Would really make more sense overall
---
What kind of logic is that? Why would a US resident have no business in eastern europe but travelling to France is fine? People can travel to wherever the fuck they want. Maybe some guy wanted to see the Red Square, maybe he was doing a Eurotrip. Maybe he has relatives or friends there and a free place to stay.
---
What kind of gatekeeping is that?
---
As a warlock i would reccomend.
---
Dont use void use imp for hp boost.
---
Give tank a few seconds to grab aggro.
---
Good habit to open on the mob tank pulls.
---
if its a big pull i would say 3-4+ mobs give tank a few extra seconds to get aggro on em all and use aoe.
---
Don't life tap like a maniac during fights.
---
Targets are usually Skull first then X and Square is usually a sheep for mages so avoid aoe or dotting it till tank aggros it.
---
Soul Stone healer not yourself. 
---
Dismiss pet if jumping of ledges to a floor below.
---
Need on gear you need. Greed on rest.
---
Bring Water. Dungeons can be long so having spare so you dont have to rely on spirit tap is always helpfull.
---
/roll for chests. Don't just loot it.
---
Moat important if everyone dies, do not rage or quit gives you a bad rep. Shit happens, run back, rebuff and continue to kick ass. ot let healer ress with soul stone and ress all going bk to top tip.
---
probs more but these are some common ones.
---
Oh yea and do not be offended if your told your too low, dungeons can be punishing with underleveled players.
---
Join /Lookingforgroup to find dungeon grps faster.

Were you in the German Army. Speaking of, I’m receiving the German Armed Forces Badge today!
---
Agreed. Just play how you want. If a mount isn't that important to you, then don't worry about it
---
Yeah, I see your point. It's just that their production value is through the roof compared to independent content creators.
---
Being successful is a talent in itself.
---
Unless you are literally born into stardom, which is extremely rare, you have something that people admire/like/get entertained by etc, and that is a talent on its own.
---
To have a successful stream that thousands watch everyday means that you are talented in some way dont you think? Or how do you explain their success otherwise?
---
My little niece was looking at little ballerina videos. Youtube thought I'm pedo for months.
---
&gt;Then they get inside Org and Asmon targets Saurfang.
---
There you have it
---
The mistake
---
You're vastly overestimating the difficulty of vanilla raiding.
---
So all EU realms where half is high and 2-3 are full and rest medium every evening and during late afternoon, you feel equals a majority? What number do you have in mind behind the word “majority”? 50%? 25%? 90%?
---
Thanks for posting that. I had seen that also. Very Nice work. I tried to reach out to that user for some assistance but I didn't get a response.
---
His personality is very different than others I've seen. I don't watch a lot, but I really didn't like watching him.
---
I didn't like how he heavily overreacts to anything and how he manages to blame blizzard for everything else.
---
&gt; The game obviously supports raid vs raid

Horde lvl 52.5, about to head into Un'Goro, thinking of Western Plaguelands after that (have quest asking me to go there). What zones are good after those?
---
try to find a very basic youtube guide... its really not that complex for basics operations, like what i mentioned above.
---
you need to invest max 1hour to setup everything
---
What’s the cost for a 100% mount? Somewhere around 500g?
---
I think the mount cost change was 1.12.2 and were just base 1.12
---
Exactly. Paladins have the same thing. T2 is well rounded and pretty amazing for gameplay outside of raids.
---
I'd much rather look like a complete clown while casting Flash of Light for a few hours every week and have my cool looking tier sets for the 6.5 other days. It's better this way.
---
depends on the group but yeah generaly it's faster, especially with a good healer who understands the 5 second rule you can keep going for a while untill he runs dry. 
---
Assuming you're doing normal pulls and not playing leeroy Jenkins :p
---
Humble brag!
---
240-70 on gandling horde
---
Definitely
---
You are missing an important part of the equation here: you need to do this with something people actually need. No one need Kingsblood that much.
---
Confirmed asmonstan
---
Life tap with reserve. It's a contested skill, but the number one thing is never spam it.
---
Personally, I say use only when someone isnt taking alot of damage. Never use it out of combat and expect to be healed (it's great to hit it a few times and eat while u drink. Can use cheaper forms of food and water together.
---
I'd argue that anyone who write LiKe ThIs is a hopeless cause. Asmongold is talented, its a fact. Otherwise he wouldnt be so popular.
---
Hate him all you want, no idea why you would hate him for producing content not catered at you, but you do you mate.
---
Go soutch Shimmering Flats just north of Gadgetzan. There is a lake with Basilisks with good respawn. Farm and skin them and sell all of it to the vendor or AH if you like.
---
Bonus points for trolling people with a cleared instance, saving/locking them to a fully cleared one.

This was (I think) the reason they implemented the conformation later on.

Classic winds, the youtuber did a whole video on this.

[Classic\_winds\_video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaVmoxse1_4)
---
Maybe it was 1. Can't remember lol
---
Yes, that's a huge problem! For example in some guild there are like 5-6 fury warriors and 4-5 rogues. Imagine the competition for Vis'Kag and Brutality Blade for a second. Would it hurt the game balance if there were like 1-2 ferals, 1-2 ret pala/ench shammy spots?
---
But nooooo, pplE picked easy classes like rogues, locks, mages and warroirs, and now are wondering how to get a spot in ubrs group and compete with like 4-5 ppl for dal'rends with ~10% droprate.
---
One of the best examples that comes to my mind is mythic Kil'Jaeden from the Tomb of Sargeras. Inbetween phases he flies off the platform and casts orbs at different corners of the arena that push you back when they hit the ground. And of course you can fall off. You will also probably get knocked off if you aren't fast enough, since there are other mechanics happening as well.
---
After wiping 100 times to the boss it becomes mostly muscle memory but from the first time getting to the intermission until those 100 wipes happen it's hell.
---
Here's the part I am talking about: https://youtu.be/8it5rki5I10?t=226
---
Later on there is a second one but this time around you have to kill adds in addition to dealing with the orbs while the whole room goes dark. Of course people were able to cheese it with a bit more gear later on.
---
Just because it is listed 1400 doesn't mean he's selling 1400
---
C'thun has some of the best/creepiest voice lines. I cant help but *feel* it when he says "your heart will explode"... Totally creeps my out.
---
It is absolutely unreasonable mate. End of discussion
---
Because blizzard picks and chooses what they like with no regard to how the actual patch progression was.
---
That's why we have bindings in phase 1, but no lv50 class quests, we have pre 1.12 mount system with 1.12 talents and 1.12 itemization except 1.10 items aren't in the game, meanwhile we have 1.5 items released but no 1.5 dungeons. 
---
It's a mess, but that's how it is.

have fun in the higher dungeons and raids ^^
---
Wow the leather on Herod is about triple that.
---
Dont forget warriors are porbably the best tanks and the best dps so you already have variety there.
---
I gotta say tho, I am maining a warrior and I got a druid alt that im gonna use mostly for gathering herbs and engineer maths and ofc I will love to raid with it once it hits 60
---
Why?
---
Talent at being born in a time where being a manchild earns you money if you can manipulate children.
---
It's pre-PreBiS.
---
The perspective continuity on the right (left) hand is off, along with the sword. Otherwise fantastic work.
---
&gt;no QOL changes, just more content.
---
Some qol stuff would be fine, as long as its not cross server shit, or things that hurt the community.
---
Definitely don't want the reset system of the expansion cycle, just kills the game
---
So does everyone in the army
---
Guess we're actually paying for the updating of the retail game and Classic is just an extra fan-service included. Or you're paying for them to keep re-releasing the old content in phases.
---
Could you explain why?
---
Damn you won 71 Briarwood Reeds? I can’t even get one!
---
He's playing a warlock
---
It's not no, but if there's something actually useful on the AH it's gonna be expensive as hell, and grinding dungeons is actually decent exp but I still wouldn't recommend farming out pieces.
---
Why i have a strong feeling that this post has nothing to do with chat boxes and you wanted to show us your mats and gold in your bag lol
---
Not to mention good damage in open world :) little meh for dungeon dmg but you can dps better than other meme specs;)
---
Why are you as well as your forsaken rogue brethren the most aggressive characters in the open world? What is it that makes you two so bloodthirsty?
---
The cost is 900g
---
Your negaitivity is priceless, your lack of inability to see excitement when it screams in your ears is dumb.  
---
This was the best moment in raiding since i cleared BC content back then - and yes, i was the one shooting the last frostbolt.
---
The build up, people dieing, submerge, having no healers, going down from 100k with barely any mana and anyone alive was just the best moment ever.
---
Talk that away from us how much you want, with our "stupid fun", if you can't feel the difference between a serious WORLD FIRST clickbait video and a video out of pure joy andhappiness, then you can sincerely gtfo
---
Prettg sure it's 900 (100 but you're gonna be honored so 10% off)
---
These look like screencaps from the WoW anime we never got.
---
Stick to arms til 55. Then respec to a good tanking spec and grind dungueons that gives you good exp or good dps and tanking gear so you can raid by the time you hit 60
---
Yeah I always think that tent looks like a duck too
---
"I follow this ruleset and I judge others based off of this, but I don't have an agenda"
---
effing BS. your agenda is the everyone should roll greed. idky it's so hard to admit that.
---
Idgaf about what he is selling them for, i want them back at 400. There was enough supply for the early demand. He's just a wanker destroying the fun of people who actually play the game.
---
1k for training + mount (before discounts).

&gt;upset with me for one reason or another

Can't help you mate if you're not gonna tell us what the actual issues are.

Players can still run MC after BWL is released, it's not like they're going to remove MC.

Yea you fucked up mate

Axe for trolls too?

Mounts were changed in 1.12.1, not 1.12.

Well yes and no it's honestly not that hard to manage mobs and the dungeon layout is not a game ender just need to be careful with pulls and ensure you LOS any big pulls around corners to ensure runners can't cause you more trouble, tactical mastery imo literally just allows you to charge or execute as a tank there are plenty of other ways to compensate for the lack of charge/execute the rage generation that you get from the talent is made up for by the extra rage generated by DW.
---
But in reality yes it does take time to get used to and it's not a traditional tanking style so it does get some getting used to but I would say starting earlier is better to get the hang of it
---
I'm at work right now, maybe tonight and if not definitively tomorrow in the afternoon
---
Do you even believe that yourself? Do you honestly believe that you can just start streaming randomly while being a whiny bitch and become a millionaire even though you have nothing to appeal to the audience?
---
Do you realize how ridiculous that sounds? Asmongold is a talented streamer, end of story.
---
And once more, I dont watch his streams, cause I dont like his content, I am just a normal person with a rational mind that does not understand why you need to hate people for no reason at all.
---
I watched hundreds of people fuck around in westfall yesterday and didn't notice it too much
---
Yes it's incredibly hard to explain through text but I believe u got what I was saying. I got my second auto shot off faster when casting aimed shot directly before shooting my first one, compared to casting aimed right after shooting it like everyone says
---
It is an exploit because you are supposed to not be eligible for any loot from that raid again until the lockout expires with the weekly reset, just as it was for every single raid before and afterwards in any other difficulty.
---
you can reserve whatever the hell you want, but if it's too much then people won't join. That's the dynamic.
---
Oh man, THIS might be it. I think it's like 2.5
---
asmon by chance?
---
Same. I'm trying to be efficient, but combining work, a healthy social life and wow is hard.
---
What I've seen is usually the first orb is reserved for the tank because they need nothing else from strat live.
---
A recent patch actually mutes team chat by default for you. I haven’t turned it back on.
---
30min/day for a week (7days)= 30min/played.
---
okay
---
As I see it you are offering people a boost through the dungeon as for example a Warlock can do with mara when farming rings. You don't need to do the dungeon, but you have the abilities a lot of players needs to be able to do Stratholme. No one needs to pay the Warlock for their services, they can join any regular group if they prefer. But there are a lot of people that rather "pay" for a tank the to spend hours searching for one. It is a win-win situation for everyone involved and if someone is against it they don't have to join.
---
I agree with the other guys sentiment. I liked how I could recognise certain people by their gear. I knew who was hardcore and who was casual just by looks alone. I feel looking good is one incentive to keep progressing end game along with character power. Not being definable is kind of boring and no Ody really looks special in retail anymore.
---
I would agree that transmog is one of the downfalls of modern wow, along with lfr, multiple difficulties, the whole "catering for casuals" approach. But then again, it was a good business decision from blizz and I'm glad more people can experience the content since after all, it doesn't affect me. Just something I think the game would be better off without.
---
He learned very quickly that day. Saurfang is not to be fucked with.
---
Fury warriors who refuse to tank are the worst , so not much supoort from my side tbh.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames. It's fairly customizable.
---
CAn't tAKe a jokE. I reallt don't have a horse in this race. Don't care. Just thought your comment, as i said before, sucked.
---
Here are a few tips. I've mained mage since vanilla, so at least I know a little about how to play the class. 
---
* Sheep enemies marked with moon at the beginning of the fight (sheep should land just after tank pulls, never before), and keep them sheeped till the group is ready. I usually don't sheep otherwise, unless something unexpected happens (extra pull, patrol, etc). 
---
* It's the tank's job to pull
---
* Normally don't AoE without having discussed with the group beforehand. It pulls agro really easily.
---
* Be mindful of which enemy the tank (in particular) and group (in general) is focusing. Focused DPS makes the tank take less dmg.
---
* Don't frost nova enemies next to the healer (or other ranged dps). They will attack party members in melee range. 
---
* Don't take agro from the tank. Even if you lose it again, they can go for the healer.
---
* If you do pull threat, don't run away from the tank. Run towards him/her if you can (unless the tank isn't paying attention, in which case you need to solve the problem yourself somehow) 
---
* Mana efficiency is often better than slightly higher dps
---
* Use your counterspell carefully. It is powerful, but scarse. But do use it. 
---
* Keep your mana up as best you can. You can sit through a trash pull once in a while if your group doesn't need you. 
---
* Have some stacks of food and water ready for the beginning of the dungeon and offer to the group.
---
* Don't stand in fire
---
* Be a pleasant person.
---
Obviously these are general guidelines, and sometimes you have to break them. But if you keep these in mind, you won't be a meme mage. Just work with and listen to your group, and you'll be fine. Communication is one of the most important skills of classic.
---
sell it for less than him but close enough to his cost that buying yours and selling it at his price causes him to lose money because of the ah cut. then he's just fucked if you have enough to do that.
---
You will get a lot more gold now from questing alone. I suggest instead of spending time to farm it now just keep leveling and you will have it soon enough
---
How many tanks are you getting for strat live?
---
It was nicknamed Molten Bore and Molten Chore for a reason
---
The worst part of this criticism is that it's based on bullshit. He's literally one of the most mature minds of Twitch. He is business minded, focused, self aware and honest.
---
He is acting cocky and narcissistic which causes him to end up in extremely humiliating situations at times which he handles like a boss for the most time. He can make fun of himself, he doesn't take personal attacks personal, he acts very little on his initial emotions.
---
He is fucking a hot bimbo (gold digger or not) that most of his haters only can dream of fucking. He is a millionaire and most likely already made more money than most his haters will in their lifetime.  
---
His audience as you say are typically older than other streams viewers.
---
The only reason these people hate Asmongold is because they hate, that acting like a confident asshole will give you a better life, than being the pussies they were raised by their single mothers to be. Now they don't understand how a guy like Asmongold who acts completely unlike anything they were told to earns 100 times what they make and can get all the pussy they dream of. 
---
They should direct their anger on the society that raised them to be bunch of pussies who will never get any money and never make any women wet.
---
Do it please, all the videos are bullshit
---
Lmao, dps warriors.
---
I don’t care about my joke, I’m right
---
I did read a few but most of the Mage one tend to be for AOE farming which I don't have the spec for.
---
I really do like this built  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0p0xhMxsZZxtckxq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0p0xhMxsZZxtckxq)  but it's not the more efficient one.
---
Feral/resto is always a good pick, good for healing, tanking and solo farming
---
Negative to a few tbh. One is just super hated
---
I'm not talking about EU.
---
It is a very rare drop that sells for little compared to the time it takes to farm it. So if you spend your time farming gold somewhere else you probably get it faster.
---
No, because the point I'm making is you're mistaken. It was never a 1v1 scenario when you're fighting a multi-boxer.
---
 You either didnt read what i wrote or just dumb. You keep talking about that guy and me hating him like a mindless reddit zombie while i was talking about streaming in general and how manipulating children gets you money. Such talent. If you actually competed in anything or worked hard and got a degree in anything you would know what talent and work is and wouldnt be arguing with me. I wouldnt call you a lost cause like you did to me , i hope you grow up and understand one day
---
Ok good, just going to ignore the "latency" things lol. I've physically tested it many, many times and shooting on the red and skipping the autoshot animation is the best. The only thing that may change that is that I have a 2.5 gun, and maybe it's different with a 3.3 like you're supposed to have. I can't see that being the case though
---
Keep em. You will use them for over a year, probably.
---
Dude power level me
---
I'll have to take a look at that one if I start to have problems. I like how customizable it is.
---
slight amendment: battle shout generates aggro for every \*target\* you buff. Pets count. So with a hunter and a warlock in the group, your battle shout does significantly more threat.
---
How can a fresh 60 be bored. You have months of content
---
Yo, benediction is the best, just gets crazy at night.  Almost full, equal faction representation... best server NA
---
So what? It's five characters, that's all that matters.
---
Kek imagine reserving the mount
---
You think you are, but... you know how it goes man.
---
You can be right or wrong all you want... still suck tho.
---
Cool, but how do I see my spell crit?
---
I posted a similar question earlier but I feel I should be more specific: should warrior tanks roll on two handed swords?
---
F, upvote
---
Still makes sense to explain the tank-reasoning. For example: If the warrior LineOfSight/corner-pulls and the lock starts dotting before the ranged/mage units walk to the corner, the ranged units will stay ranged and the LoS-pull is useless.
---
Dude what a piece of work you are. I question your logic on a forum dedicated to discussion and you go all defensive like a child. Cuts my "raid vs raid" sentence in half to misrepresent it and cries about Blizzards greed as if that alone explains the issue. Grow the F up.
---
Yeh boonatix shut up
---
You wanna see my bags after fishing for 6 hours?
---
It actually has huge downsides.  
---
You are running a low level dungeon on your alt. Notorious twink item drops. Some idiot hunter needs the melee weapon that could sell to a twink rogue for hundreds of gold and equips it.  
---
It also has the effect on the economy on the flip side on the economy of making BoE's more expensive.  
---
The "need automatically binds it" is basically a step towards personal loot.
---
Whaaaat. Oh Lord. I deleted a few to make bag space yesterday whilst in SoS....
---
I’m L39 with 50g...
---
I don't care what people say. Min max for me is like playing this game as a job. I want full tier 1 2 and 3 as my prot warrior. I don't want to wear a fucking lvl 48 epic boots til naxx. I don't care if it makes me 0,05% more tanky. I love tier bonuses and the way they change classes. Example being earthfury. Some people say it's dogshit and I have to disagree, it fundamentally changes your playstylw from aoe healer to maintank healing aswell as that healing also healing the other melee. It's fucking awesome
---
I'm the same level. Done Blasted lands? Azshara? I would wait on plaguelands the mobs are usually 54+ I tried and got stuck on second cauldron quest
---
Swamp of sorrows and badlands. Finish up desolace/arathi/alterac
---
On Zandalaar Tribe "The Defias Brotherhood", anytime someone leaves their name is put on "the list".
---
&gt;People are severely overestimating how fast players are clearing the raid content.
---
Not saying you're wrong but my experience differs quite a bit:
---
I took a week off work at the start, but otherwise have real life commitments still. I'm currently 4/8 Tier 1 set and my /played is under 2 weeks. I also didn't play Vanilla so it's not like I have any prior knowledge that put me at an advantage.
---
Not super desperate for new raids though, still plenty to get done before new content, but it's the gap between P2-P3 that imo could be a problem.
---
Because this thread is totally not forced and righteously provoked.
---
You never questioned my logic, you just didn't read. And now that you do, you have nothing to question as expected.
---
It's a great server!
---
Ahh, I remember the day I got my Perdition's Blade in vanilla on my rogue. Seeing it drop and knowing it was mine was one of the greatest feelings I ever had in a game.
---
Well, I cant do anything with other people thoughts =/  But if you want to speak about this: im level 55 player, there are like 20-30 gold on materials , so its like 320 gold wealth totally. I did nothing for earning this money , just playing game (and not wasting money on craft). Which means this is NORMAL amount of money for a player. So,the question - why would I trying to show basic amount of gold to other people..?   
---
Like I said - I just was pleased with another player attitude and thats why created post. Maybe thats nothing special for other players (while 300g almost at max lvl - is special,heh) , but for me that was cute :3
---
That’s your opinion? I really don’t care. Stay on topic and stop being a social justice warrior
---
Dude, not cool posting NSFW content here
---
Also me, have a 34 druid, 22 mage, 22 pally on pve.
---
Started up a a horde shaman on another friends pvp realm. Got to 20 a few hours ago.
---
Help.
---
felwood/winterspring, blasted lands if ally
---
Your reading is atrocious.
---
Thanks mate, loved Arathi but just elite quests left and I’m struggling to find people for hem since general in zones below 50 seems dead
---
Hold till phase 2
---
Drop skinning, you only needed it for some quick vendor cash really. Keep herb at 60 so you can farm materials for pots/flasks. No contest.
---
they are honorless 30 sec after arrival, so they only give honor on their first death
---
well you are right that actually shows BRM. I might be wrong and it's anecdotal at best but I was thinking more about city raids and actual pvp raids and not the random meetup of two pve raid groups. back in the day open world pvp after BGs were released was pretty much non existant on the EU server I was on. few ganks here and there but no big raid groups.
---
I’m currently traveling in former USSR and worried about this.
---
Just make sure you sort your shit out on Bank alts every 30 days
---
Total or for each?
---
You are a honorless target for 30 seconds after landing (even now, with no honor system in place). So a group of 60 farming people landing in a zone would get a grand total of ZERO honor.
---
Keep them and use them over other pairs on BiS guides?
---
Be careful saying the words ‘MT’ and ‘my guild is paying for me’ around these parts: much of r/classicwow is under the impression that tanks are crybabies that should farm everything for themselves and have no redeeming factors
---
Also, preventing the other faction from doing what they want/gathering resources is important to me.
---
Let tank lead the way and dont be too trigger happy. Follow tank's path. Don't aggro other packs because you went left side of tunnel while you cleared mobs on right. 
---
Dont over life tap and be ready to bandage yourself. 
---
Have phased imp to give your party stam buff and tank fire shield. Do not have it set to aggresive. Manualy force him attack specific targets. Also when jumping down dismiss your pet and summon again.
---
Do not fear unless told to. 
---
Keep soustone on healer, trade healthstones to tank. Keep track of how many soulshards you have to always be ready to make some healthstones. 
---
When you mess up, apologise. Shit happens people will understand. Nobody is perfect.
---
Chest at 53, HoJ at 55.
---
I barely have time to play WoW, sounds like good advice thanks.
---
i leveled a warrior to 32, got my WW axe with help from guildies and got fed up with no good place to lvl, lvled a hunter to 22 and now i'm somehow back to thinking i should lvl a warlock, priest of rogue. (lvl10ish).
---
so yeah, i ruined my classic already.
---
Inb4 post removed
---
Yeah I saw a graph one day, saying that most (80%) of the player base were between levels 1 and 40, with a solid part of those being level 1s and between 20 and 40. At that point, I was 46 on my priest.
---
I've by no means played efficiently, I've been goofing around, afk'ed and stuff. I have been online a lot though. So I agree, most people are around that level, most likely.
---
Husband skill 300
---
zones usually only have a handful of quests that are level appropriate, meaning if you dont want to fight higher level mobs you need to travel.
---
Pro tips : have fishing and go farm some murloc -&gt; money, grey, cooking item and the thing you fish.
---
This was a really interesting read and I appreciate your take on this!
---
You are right. Sorry my bad :/
---
But u can just fear them...
---
Amateur unloads on two babes in the desert.
---
This is what I was wondering. I haven’t played since TBC where there would definitely be more than 1 group. I just didn’t know how it was normally with 40 mans. I just see them rotating out people, which won’t be tanks lol. Thanks for the insight.
---
Go farm the fire elementals in Arathi Highlands. The burning chrests sell for 40s each and the fire elementals sell for 2g a piece on my server. 1 hour of farming got me 46 burning chrests and 20 elemental fire. Easy way to get gold.
---
:O  &lt;3 No problems,friend :)
---
It's not that common i think, but people that want to min max everything and have the time probably make the BOP items from gnomish and switch to goblin.
---
*laughs in blessing of freedom*
---
Go get a pocket pally, it'll change your life.
---
The thing is that currently some people gank low level zones for the hell of it since they have nothing to do and want something to do. Kind of like a let's fuck around type thing, where people still can do stuff a majority of the time.         
---
But once people and hardcore rankers have an incentive no one's going to be able to level past 50, seriously. It's not going to be a single person roaming around killing, it's going to be organized groups.       
---
I don't see why TM vs South Shore would return apart from people fucking around, because the people that want to rank are going to be camping BRM, and any higher level zone that has a flood of people coming through.    
---
Like right now BRM could be a bit of PvP depending on the time, and people wanting to wipe other people's buffs out. But we don't even have real incentive yet. Once that comes good fucking luck casuals
---
So many streamers: “send me gold/mats and I’ll say your name on stream” and it’s more the attitude - very self aggrandizing. People defending them and calling it “envy” doesn’t help, you’re disregarding players legitimate opinions. You’re making your favorite streamer look worse.
---
laughs in mage, then dies of a minor disease
---
You dont have to drop any of them yet, i mean it would be great to have both herb &amp; skinning when you're 56+ in Ungoro for devilsaur+herb farm.
---
Tailoring wont make you money yet on lvl 42, most bags go for ingredient prices and the margins are low. You're gonna want that tailoring for the epic recipes, mooncloth bags and all that, but thats more lvl 60 stuff than now.
---
tldr; moneywise it would be best to swap after you done farming and got your epicmount at 60 imo
---
I bet you only started to hate him when he blew up on classics release.
---
The period before bgs was the most fun I had playing vanilla wow. The silly SM/TM zergs, random world pvp all over the palce
---
Yeah, thats nice. Still getting both so early is rare.
---
I just quickly ran the Fight Club spreadsheet to put some numbers on it. Full Pre-BiS, except I swapped Devilsaur Leggings for Cloudleeper Legplates (to remove the set bonus from the equation). Dal'Rend set as weapons. Set is above hit cap regardless of weapon skill. Standard buffs and debuffs, no weird shit.
---
- Human, Devilsaur Gauntlets: 681 DPS
---
- Human, Edgemasters Handguards: 686 DPS
---
- Night Elf, Devilsaur Gauntlets: 624 DPS
---
- Night Elf, Edgemaster Handguards: 677 DPS
---
So a human gains less than 1% DPS from Edgemasters, a non-human about 8% if you disregard the indirect DPS increase due to swapping out some +hit items from other slots. I would definitely not spend epic mount amounts of cash on Edgemasters as a human.
---
Download it manually, not through app. That’s how I got it
---
&gt;The less gcds spend on tapping the more dps you do.
---
You gain more dps by stacking +shadow gear then you gain from saving 1.5s each time you tap.
---
too soon?
---
From what I've heard, for tanking, you'll want a fast weapon for rage generation. Thus the Bone Slicing Hatchet with it's 1.7 speed would be superior to the Tooth of Eranikus. Hit percentage is of course important, but as you said, that can be gathered from other items. I am no expert however.
---
Most time spent from 1-60 is like moving around so the 60% mount is a massive boost reducing that time.
---
Does it not get better? I was forced to dps SM yesterday and it just sucked. My dps was fine, I guess, but I was just allllways oom. I'm shadow speced for soloing but until now had only been doing dungeons as healer.
---
Can barely use MB because it's an aggro machine so I basically just stoof there mindflaying all dungeon long. Then get low on Mana, and wand forever.
---
The most fun I had was trying to snipe lasthits with mindblast so I could proc spirit tap
---
Lol who gave it away?
---
Living rent free in their heads.
---
Bah! Knew I should have specified melee weaopns...
---
When I plan on using lifetap a bunch I bring bandages and inform the healer. Keeps them from wasting mana on me.
---
imagine being upset about DM being a little off the beaten path when you have a bulk of first few phases in your Blackrock backyard...
---
It is actually the other way around - speaking of diablo and not d3 - wow took so many core things from diablo games. I remember reading some interviews where D2 devs even wanted the next diablo to be mmo like, which was in conflict with wow which already took so many of the things from diablo, so they weren't allowed to continue with what they wanted and eventually parted ways.
---
D3 devs arent they also wow devs if i recall right? then moved back to wow. Either way, if you loved D2 it's a looot of elements that went to wow including loot systems, talent trees etc.  That's why it was so natural for me to progress from D2 straight into wow. It was more of the same for me.  
---
Blizz owes so much to D2 for paving the way, and they shitted on it and made a game(D3) for an entirely different audience than the people who brought them to where they are.
---
For most pulls, when farming for efficiency, yeah obviously stealth just slows you down. What's the better opener to use when you just want to sneak the fuck up and kill something, say a gnome mage got instance?
---
 For me it was more of a “dead server” - I know it’s a meme but AH was dead, cities were dead, rare to see any more than2-3 players in zones... add on it being a BR transfer option and that’s that.
---
wow! thanks for this!
---
Grats lil gnomie, cool ui!
---
As long as you make it very clear at the beginning, that sounds reasonable.  Just a quick "FYI first orb is on reserve if you guys are good with that." I would let people know right when/before you invite them; if someone doesn't want to run with that rule, better to let them know now than after waiting for a group to form.  Even after letting people know individually, I would do another reminder again at the start just so it's super clear.
---
Not much to do there. Blasted lands is ok if you're alone, but when I did that there were tons of people trying to do the beast quests and it took me like 2 hours for those 5 quests, absolutely not efficient. Azshara has very few quests as well. They're not bad, but it won't get you far. And the zone layout is terrible.
---
Tbh this isn’t pathetic it’s literally apart of the game, it’s not that crazy or impressive given the circumstances of the opponents but I think it’s steep to call it pathetic. This is what world pvp was and what it will continue to be.
---
No you are very wrong, you have no idea hahaha. People want the gear and bg’s is far more go or efficient than wpvp sucking majority of the players out of wpvp if you want any gear.yes there will be some wpvp but no where near to the scale as if bgs weren’t in the game. Please stop claiming bgs won’t effect wpvp it’s really really stupid
---
that's why you want a dispelling priest on your back. solo, it get's frustrating incredibly fast.
---
\#nochanges
---
Loot Best Practices:
---
-if you are a hybrid class and filling a role you are not spec’ed for you should only roll NEED on your role’s gear
---
-if you want different gear just let the group know upfront!
---
Somehow our healer paladin rolled Need on mail pants with +20 agi and + bow skill for the measly +9 isn’t because “it’s an upgrade for my healing set”
---
Yes he won
---
I always starts with:  
---
Stealth &gt; Tiger Fury *(TF dont break stealth)* \&gt; Ravage &gt; Faerie Fire &gt;   
---
Now after F.F if im with a tank, SHRED, if you are solo, Claw. and then finish with Ferocious Bite.
---
I dont use RIP and Pounce on PVE Environment, only on PVP.
---
Has anyone sold theirs yet? I just got one and wanted to know if people are buying them. I am lvl 40 and I want to use it to get my mount.
---
Well far enough into the game you might get a group together where only the leader doesn’t have it
---
Yea definitely, especially if you DPS and manage your aggro well.
---
Bluto smash! Smash ‘em gud!
---
No they won't.  The real try harders will be farming people that actually give them honor, and the people who don't may grief, but will get bored of it before too long.  Nobody is going to spend an hour camping a FP, because it means they will rank slower, and if someone does, it's probably a good time to take a break anyway instead of feeling exactly the way they want you to feel.
---
As an added point, hanging around opposing faction strongholds is dangerous because of potential DKs.  In fact, if you aggro on a flight master, they're some of the most dangerous NPCs in vanilla, because they'll sick a horde of mounts on you.
---
Well clearly he's about to learn the time-tested lesson of "If it smells like Trout get the fuck out"
---
Honorless for all of 15 seconds.
---
Also, nobody said the campers were smart.
---
Damn those pig men. *wipes away a tear* damn them all to the twisting nether.
---
When you on westfall server and try to see if there is anyone you know
---
How do you chat with the enemy exactly?
---
People who think it’s bad to reserve are people you never want to play with anyways
---
Hotw/ns ain't no meme spec
---
Couldn't
---
I mean, is this really such a bad thing?
---
If you consistently need large quantities of Kingsblood, you shouldn't be buying it up from the AH to begin with, you should be out farming it. If you only occasionally need kingsblood, it still isn't that horrifically much to buy it. If you're trying to sell kingsblood, you can either undecut this guy by a lot or a little, either way he's probably going to buy you out and sell at this higher price, so nice, there's some market stability.
---
Nobody really seems to lose here. The AH is a completely optional part of the game. If this was a rare, hard to obtain item you *really* need, it would be a different story, but it's kingsblood. As more people get gold, the economy is going to inflate over time, and if people are willing to spend this much on kingsblood, people are going to keep charging this much.
---
Ah, this faction thing is too much RP bullshit for me. I don't identify as "horde" or "alliance". There are people on the other side too and they want to have fun. I'm not really impacted by this guy getting another flower, now am I?
---
(Except of course if I'm a herbalist and it is 'my' flower. But even then I would only fear someone lower level then me and not kill him)
---
I am whelmed.
---
HhlHHHHHHOOOOOOOOO
---
Basically the reason I left a guild. I don't want to be on fucking discord if I want to chat to my guild.
---
This was an interesting discussion. Why tf was it removed?
---
No, I meant they would be taking OP as a DPS as a opposed to a healer. They still would still probably prefer priest heals in the ideal group anyway.
---
Damn can you tell me your ingame name if you’re horde mograine so I never encounter you in a group ever ? Would be nice
---
This. In Classic you can just add them to the douchbag list and move on and never see them again. Just in case. Stay away from what people call "cleave" meta. Those people do not share your mindset and mine.
---
The thing is, you can get these right now for the cheapest they will ever be. And cheaper than the meme price in OP too. Might take some whispers and waiting for Auctions to expire. But 200-500 gold is cheap for a BIS forever mitigation item.
---
thank you, I now know that it wasn\`t me tht sucked at tanking, it was the others :))) (had a dungeon run with 3 warriors, and the tank could not hold aggro for the love of god, even tho he was like 6 lvs over me)
---
There's nothing to discuss. 1 character against five equal level characters is 1v5 and never a balanced fight.
---
Because I´m a lazy son of a bitch I just copy a former reply.
---
Please don´t see this as disrespectful.

The Need to brag on reddit that he stomped someone that isn´t even a Competition is what disgusts me.

Just like any other big tech company :-(

You are that guy. Don't be that guy.

Kingsblood isn't used for anything important, usually just a way to level alchemy cheaply.  People will find another way and won't buy this.
---
[This](https://www.thoughtco.com/reading-comprehension-strategies-7952) might help.
---
You are particularly dense.
---
Yes, it's one human character... with the power level of five in-game characters.  Hence why it's broken from a gameplay perspective.  You need five IRL people to beat one IRL person.
---
I don't know what part of this you are having so much trouble with.
---
My point why does it matter to you or me ? They do whatever they want. If i want i donate all of my stuff to someone. If he asks for it and someone gives him its his decision. Asmon or anyone doesnt Hold a gun to your gear and say : gimmie your gold
---
They drop big mouth clams IIRC.   Those clams have a chance to drop golden pearls, which are always in need for higher end tailoring etc.   If you can get a few of those pearls, they can sell anywhere from 5-10g (or more), depending on the server of course.
---
Unless you're horde, fk em. It is your BIS until phase 2, how dumb would it be if you weren't allowed to roll on your best in slot? Sure they get a lot more out of it, and some people expect you to honor that, but you're definitely not obliged to. It's not like you're going to raid with them regularly and should care about their upgrades.
---
If it bothers them they won’t join easy as that 
---
I personally would much rather save 1 hour than a 1 in 5 chance to get some orb
---
Unless you're on an incredibly active pvp server, there's no way you're going to be able to find enough pvp to rank up anywhere near as fast as a BG will allow.  Additionally, classic will presumably implement the honor decay system, which means you get less (eventually no) honor for killing the same person repeatedly.  So on most servers, when you factor in decay, it will literally be impossible to rank that fast.
---
Nah, its pre raid bis for hunter and youre running a pug with basic loot rules. Sure he will tilt but its pre-raid bis for you as well. Not needing wouldve been a huge favor for him, you might have wanted to try make a deal with him I guess
---
Ooh okay, thanks for the info
---
Sounds like both.
---
I get it,  no one likes to admit they're over tuned,  but  dude,  get real lol. They have every single tool it's possible to have in this game, as well as the best offense and not bad defense.  Vanilla mages are very obviously op lol.
---
The amount if times I was bitched at for rolling need on Essences of Fire when I actually needed them to craft with, makes me not inv these tanks that demand reserves for orbs.
---
Handies behind the Crossroads Inn.  5 silver extra for less crying.  1 gold extra for more.
---
Not that I condone it, but 600 is pennies for some people - literally negligible.

Restorative/FAP potions

And he is called Oralius of all things..
---
There is an API that allows the add-on to grab the entire suction house in less than 10 seconds but you can only activate this every 15 minutes. Auctionator has it at least.
---
The worst is 2 warriors, where one is supposedly being the tank, but they both do the exact same 2h bullshit thing. Now neither of them is holding aggro properly, while i have to heal 2 tanks at once. I have to pretty much blast my full mana pool every pull and they blame me for the speed.
---
The main window lets you pick one reason among a wide selection. I don't think you can select several reasons.
---
In the stats list, you can type a reason like "Ganked me with a higher level character, while in group with a 60 warlock, while I was fighting a mob for a quest." 
---
With this comment, the rogue will stay on my KOS.
---
Exactly. If you are doing something that is illegal/not allowed you should pretty much expect to get "scammed". especially if you are stupid enough to not change the email.
---
Honestly real pvpers aren't so much into world pvp in vanilla because it's so bad. Pvp really took off for serious players in TBC with arena. A lot of "pvper" shitters got shown up badly.
---
Honestly if you really want to raid tank I would just stick it out a bit and see what happens. Continue working on your gear between raids. Mergers almost always have some clashes that end with some people here and there leaving. 
---
There's alot of people that are telling you to just leave as if it's so easy to find a guild that is recruiting a tank. Listen dude, it isn't that fucking easy. Raid tank slots are very minimal. I wouldn't fault the guild too much, they probably had to do this merger just to get enough people to raid and that comes along with some compromises. They are just trying to do what's best for the whole team.
---
Work on your gear and get active in your guilds community. I'm not saying it's supposed to be a popularity contest but when you are out running 5 guildies, in discord chatting, and especially when you are running with the officers you get a chance to show people you know your stuff. Also the ones who are most active socially tend to correlate with the ones who are loyal to the guild and want to stick around long term. You don't have to be a social butterfly, but the one's who are hermits are usually the first to get left in the cold because they just have no idea who you even are. Start talking to people.
---
You gota play the game dude. Don't let people in here tell you that you're so valuable that the guild should be sucking your dick to get you in the raid. Truth is you're not. People on Reddit like to give advice they themselves would never follow. Don't be a kissass but just get active and show people you're a good tank. If it doesn't work out start browsing around for a new guild.
---
Why is it not be be trusted anymore?
---
My server official forums had a post saying the horde has no honor.  I wanted to log on and say that's because it isn't implemented yet.
---
not true, with BGs/honor, ZG/AQ20 (3day reset?), tier 0,5 etc, you can easily skip gearing up in MC and/or BWL, depending on spec
---
Well considering you are an honorless target for 30 seconds after landing, they won’t be farming HKs.
---
90% of Alliance have downs. The other 10% are just retarded. Good job fellow Horde.
---
Great news! The longer the better, so the casual people like me can catch up soon
---
I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Am I missing something?
---
It scans everything. I tested it because I couldn't believe it. Buy the fast scan Ford the dame indexing as the slow scan. No need to wait 10 mins, done in 30 secs.
---
I thought I was on a smaller server now every zone is filled with images aoeing everything down. I'm seeing guilds I've never seen before, running in to people ive grouped with in the open world
---
I didnt 100% understand layering but I didnt think it was so deep that I'd never see a huge portion of server
---
Yea but the screenshot shows the guy has 211 gold saved up which is a lot for a fresh 40 newcomer
---
I would have to look it up, but I think it's 11.  That was a real thing in vanilla, and it will be presumably implemented in classic.
---
No one is taking anything away from you. It's awesome that you managed to wipe and kill him at the same time. It's just all of this "WORLD'S FIRST.. [insert anything possible]" that kinda grinds my gears a little.
---
Campest boss ever
---
Too fast.
---
Depends on how gear dependent your class is. For casters - yeah not so much, quest rewards and dungeons drop are good enough to keep you going. As a warrior it’s a different story though.
---
Roll rogue
---
His game, like many others is the AH.  People undercutting and pricing low are destroying his fun, but do you see him complaining?
---
People can play different ways.
---
Lmao people can form their own opinions while simultaneously still enjoy hearing the opinions of others. Just because you like to hear someone else's point of view doesn't mean you automatically adopt it. What kind of weird logic is that. Horribly binary.
---
That’s how you make serious gold in WoW people have been doing this for years nothing new
---
It's probably not your fault. You should be able to tank and hold aggro IF your DPS wait a few seconds before attacking. This is classic after all.
---
All the tips people can give are things you already terribly failed 
---
The biggest things are to save money 
---
Don’t waste on skills you don’t need 
---
Only buy weapon of ah and only if it’s a massive upgrade or if you have trouble clearing mobs 
---
Have skinning plus mining or herbalism 
---
Pick up all the loot you can get 
---
As for farming spots idk I heard of some earth elementals in badlands or sth, just google gold tips and 50 videos about it will pop up
---
A sword warrior has 7% extra swing. Charge into an affray and you have 35% or even higher with WF chance to extra swing *something*
---
No way around it until loot with + hit starts dropping. That’s why everyone says don’t level as DW.
---
Although it's going to start getting kind of hard to be motivated for another MC after you get close to all the gear you need lol.  That's why PVP is going to be so important I think.
---
Join the fight club (classic warrior) discord. Its a fantastic resource
---
I think everyone on reddit and the forums should get a computer science degree and fix all of this.
---
This is reprehensible.
---
/s
---
Same, but how can you not love the sound of chirping crackheads in the morning.
---
The upper right area of the map what is actually there?  Is it unused even in Retail?
---
Cool. Did it occur to you that other people might be interested in his opinion though? I know, amazing.
---
Retardo detected.

Casual reporting in. I'm at 35 on my highest level character.

I'm seeing the contents of this post deleted and replaced by the word, "removed".

If you aren't seeing that yourself as the OP, try opening this page in an incognito window.

Make pet battle playable as a mobile app. I would not care about anything else but this I would play when I can't log in to play Classic.
---
I find it hilarious you can't fathom the difference between bind on equip and bind on pick-up
---
Just go play retail if you think phases should be released slower than they were 15 years ago. 
---
Timegating for slower players is a retail thing, it's not vanilla.
---
If you are an Orc warrior in arms spec get this item, I bought this badboy at level 43 and didn't replace it until I got dreadforge retaliator from emperor. It made life so much easier having this. The +hit allowed me to efficiently kill mobs above my level which as a warrior feels really good. Not to mention pvp moments. If someone mistakes you for a warrior still lumbering around a WW axe at 50-55 they will soon regret it.
---
Mash that downvote button it'll make you feel better.
---
I think is the opposite in my case... for my personal experience i dont want to be with people that  try to reserve something, and i never invite them on my groups
---
Oh, thats right, mr Oxford english sir!
---
That’s what I said in the first place.  “If you are geared enough to push crits off the table, perhaps you won’t want reckoning”
---
I realize that, but switching layers to alleviate some of the over crowding is also part of the intended gameplay. It's exactly why they added layering. So apparently they missed the entire point of their own game. And I'm a tailor/enchanter, don't have a gathering profession.
---
I'm not seeing Bonereaver's Edge here! Lot of room for improvement here.
---
You 100% need your mount around 40. Zones like Tanaris will slow your leveling to a snails pace without a mount.
---
If you get crit while sited it'll not trigger the crit effect but if you sit and stand up at the right time, you'll get crit and the game will think you're standing so it'll trigger the crit effect, that need some practice
---
ninja edit
---
Back in vanilla, I was in a guild that was nowhere near top tier and I had 3 characters fully decked out in T1/T2. You shouldn't have any problems as long as you are dedicated and show up for raids. Eventually people get more and more gear and there is less competition for drops, particularly T1 armor pieces.
---
Years ago I remember Atlas and Atlasloot working together (one window, with map + loot). Is that not possible anymore? I have them both installed, but I have to go between 2 addon windows.
---
I vendored my gloves in a near exact scenario. Completely worth.
---
Weird flex
---
Or just, you know, dont open gifs if he asks for pics
---
Feleras and Tanaris
---
My guild does DING as a meme because it pisses me off. YOU SHOULD ONLY ANNOUNCE DING FROM LEVELS 50-60 DAMNIT!
---
I normally have access to a private room for shows.
---
“Dedicated racks for each server” what are you talking about? Blizzard has entirely their own cages in their data centers. You literally have no clue what their hardware infrastructure is.
---
See my edit, the auto-mail I got said it will be back up after I chose a flair, so I guess I'll have to wait, but have gotten some nice replies already, although would be nice with more, seemed to be an interest for this type of question for ferals.
---
Won it 3 times in a row some 6 years ago. Try it out, get better at and win it, I believe in you
---
looks like jar-jar binks
---
There's no fucking way that holds aggro at 60.
---
Can i disregard the axe racial bonus that orcs have, or does it make a pretty hefty difference in end game? I’m interested in undead warr but if orc racials are great, I really like orc as well.
---
The sit macro does not work in classic.
---
As for mounts, are you talking about the level 40 mount?  Definitely grab the kodo, it'll be a while before you can even use other mounts anyways
---
&gt; Aren't you sick of walking for 40 levels?
---
Not to the point of spending 100 gold on a horse, yet. I like exploring, and like I said, this is a totally new game to me, every new location is an unexplored mystery.
---
Some consumables used in PVP will jump up in price too. Such as Swiftness potions etc.
---
Yes that was an error, check my main comment. It has since been adjusted.
---
7pm to 3am I take it.
---
It is?  Word...What dungeon? BRD?  I wanna contribute!
---
You sound mad butthurt.
---
Just your hit cap play what you want man
---
You're going to need it sooner or later, and there's no better use for gold. So why not?
---
Question bashguuder vs mirah’s song which should I use? Is the proc of bashguuder worth the slightly lower damage and agility?
---
I’m a human warrior so I have five weapon skill for either weapon.
---
It's early in P1. Everyone will be running BRD for random BiS pieces for a while. They're just gonna have to run it again.
---
When I tanked as arms I would pool rage at the end of packs so I could charge tclap sweeping strikes. Switch to D stance demo revenge slam cleave all that.  Tanking  in arms is more aoe threat than prot to be honest assuming you use sweeping strikes and the fight isn’t that long. You will want to go prot for a little extra mitigation and the threat against single target in raids though .
---
I’m pretty new so I don’t really understand what I’ve done wrong just yet. So I figured I would ask for general tips and then try again. Excited to be here! What are your general pet peeves in dungeons?
---
&gt;Faerlina even a month ago had 2-3 hour queues now I can get in at peak times &lt;30 minutes
---
But now an entire other server of nerds from faerlina is high pop. That's not hype dying down. That's people moving servers so they can play MORE
---
Arugal alliance is crazy
---
Badlands is perfect at 40. Rock elementals are quite contested but the rest are all fine.
---
Just hit 60 yesterday and I'm not a big PvE/Raider. Thinking about unsubscribing from WoW until BGs are released :/
---
It's not a dps spec though.
---
That feeling when you're an object of a joke...
---
Yeah, of course, I agree.
---
The comment above me is usefup for all classes. I was just answering the question if he wants to provide some warlock-specific tips.
---
I mean, he has a point. Retail fits into schedules like that perfectly. Having casual people dictate the pacing of the endgame is exactly how retail got to where it is. It's literally history repeating itself.
---
Im playing on Ten Storms and really like it. Been there for a few weeks and it feels like home now. In the evening its usually Full but without que time. This is also one of the servera with only one layer as of a few days ago. And you really notice it, ALOT more people at the quest places. Yester day in Alterec at Dalaran there were ten horde killing quest mobs plus some allys here and there.
---
Yup. Chrome is faster, but doesn't run most of the extensions..so Chrome is the "I'm wasting time" browser, but you use IE for actual work.
---
That's a funny name. Made me remember that episod of "How I made your mother", where the guy renamed himself to CrapBag; "if you can't remember my name, just think of a bag of crap" =))
---
I'd leave your name alone, but it seems someone else got offended!
---
The orc racial means that instead of getting +9% chance to hit off your gear, you’ll only need +6%. So it’s a difference of +3% hit which means you can prioritise other stats instead of hit. As to how much of a difference this makes it’s hard to say... lots of good gear already has hit built into it
---
Fury just mentally feels better to me. But the numbers are about the same. If you're ever spending time grinding mobs and have a damage meter, be cognizant of your dps on each pull. From my observations, they are nearly identical in roughly equal gear. Any string of lucky crits can cause some outlier situations though, and when that happens, I think arms ends up being a little better. But it makes sense, since that spec relies heavily on critting.
---
Using the system by design vs ninja looting by needing everything for 15 years... yup, I think I know who the dickhole is, buddy.
---
Ah good so you don't need gear!
---
I'd be gone in an heart beat. I don't understand why everyone insist on discord when there is a perfectly good guild chat. I only want to voice chat if its raid or dungeons. Finding a guild that actually uses guild chat isn't easy..
---
Wonder what the map looks like in current retail compared to this.
---
additionally the fact that the BWL gear in many cases was not THAT much better then what came in MC or at all better
---
Perds is just as good if not better than DFB, CHT has no equal out of BWL. Toep, rings, T2 legs, hunter/priest qusts, legendary and so on 
---
we realistically didnt stop raiding MC until we were in AQ on HuHu
---
I've been seeing this more and more lately. I have a feeling it's the same people that take photos of their screen.
---
If you are a class that excels in a non DPS role expect to be doing it. I'm an elesham but 2/3 of the time I am healing dungeons because healers are harder to find than DPS.  Tanks happen to be the hardest to find so that's what you'll be doing in most dungeons leveling up, get used to it.
---
Sounds like you need a better computer
---
🦀🦀 $15 🦀🦀
---
yep, usually there is 1 or 2 rambo cloth users, easy to resolve with a good threaten to kick
---
Never said fuck you btw. Typical salty ass retarded alliance.....
---
I want to tank but I do not want to go deep prot until it is absolutely necessary. Should I stay arms or go 2h Fury for when I am not using 1h+ board?
---
Hard work does not always pay off. I have no idea who that guy is for example.
---
Asmongold is successful, and he is entertaining to the audience he caters to. That is talent. Call it luck all you want, the absolute wast majority (We are talking 99.99% here) could not have done what he has, and become as successful as him.
---
Sounds like some entitled ass level 20s you get there. Tell them to run it normal and see how long it takes. I would have quit straight away at such a comment. Fuck those guys
---
&gt;are dead in the popular farming zones
---
&gt;How is Blizzard planning to address the overpopulation issues
---
They dont have to? You know you dont have to farm the best spots right? There're suboptimal spots that aren't filled up because half of the nerds playing just look up "pre raid bis" or "classic wow farming spots" and put 0 thought in.
---
&gt; If you're not 1) Casual, 2) Heavy PvP player, WoW classic is just not for you.
---
i disagree with this
---
Who really wants to voice chat ALL the damn time? Personally I'd rather listen to music than a bunch of chatter. I know it's my personal preference but I prefer voice for raid/dungeons and all other chat in guild chat.
---
While I don't think you are necessarily wrong with where people are at (I think it might be in the 40s/50s now), since Blizz killed the census functionality, any type of player level / class / race information you have gotten since September 19th is outdated/incorrect.
---
Your a member of both, as in you are always in both channels? Your chat box must be scrolling at a million miles a minute.
---
Personally, I only join lfg when I need to group up. Then I leave it asap. Don't even fuck with world chat.
---
The real question is... did the 4 60s appear?
---
Threat meters are not accurate so I wouldn’t rely on them too much. We had a dps warrior pull aggro on Golemagg this week when the meter showed him ~20% below the MT.
---
the issue is not the content difficulty, its the difficulty of getting 40 or so people together to do the things
---
JFC people dont read...
---
Any updates for EU? Strange this is only US
---
Somehow I made it from vanilla to a month ago without ever knowing world chat was a thing... /shrug
---
Thanks a lot for the reply man!!! This is exactly what I needed to hear. It also shows that you've probably read most of the wall of text, thanks for that.
---
I would have noticed if it was a normal buyout from a faster person. In that case yeah, tough luck. It would have sucked, but I probably wouldn't have felt as bad.
---
But in this case, I am 101% certain it was a both, for which I refuse to let this slide because at the end of the day, I didn't lose the stuff because of a risk; I lost them because someone was running scripts/bots against ToS.
---
I actually got a response later last night from a GM. She said their Customer Support cannot help with AH bots (she confirmed that in her statement), but forwarded me to their Hacks team so I wrote them an email with all of this. There's going to be a further investigation about all of this. Dates, time, characters, items, how quickly stuff was bought and with what interface etc.
---
There's still light at the end of the tunnel. I just have no idea how long this would take :(
---
What the fuck quest is this lol
---
Found the horde camper.
---
What level and spec are you?
---
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
This sounds like it could get weird / dangerous pretty quick.
---
Same thing happened with our last guild run, druids are scare out here
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=18499](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=18499) 
---
Can be casted when already feared.
---
I gotta say, the people that are clamoring for no phase 3 until mid 2020 are out of their damned minds. How the hell do you advocate for an even slower release schedule than the original patch cycle? 
---
I won't even get deep into how phase 2 doesn't particularly add a trove of new content that's worth 3+ months.
---
At the absolute latest, phase 3 should be out by April. The big features of it are BGs (1.5) and BWL (1.6) and those came out slightly less than 8 months after the US launch. Personally, I feel like if phase 2 is late 2019, you could probably release phase 3 in February. There was only a 3 month gap between Dire Maul's release and BGs back in vanilla afterall.
---
These flair rules are dumb as hell.
---
I agree, the first cpl of bosses will get pugged, but Fankris/huhu will is issues for pugs as as well as some of the end wing bosses/ patchwerk in naxx
---
There are degrees obviously with Asmongold and Alexensual being the most hated streamers but pretty much all of them are disliked more or less.
---
seriously... coming from Path of Exile, i was amazed by the quality of various wow content creators who make guides. or should i say by the lack of quality. they all spew out the same useless shit, stamina = hp, str = melee damage, and they make the vids last 15 minutes!
---
Dont listen to this person. Literally all i have in my groups 45-60 was enh shams
---
You’ve got bag space and shop food?  Weird flex, but ok.
---
thank for the post! I'm actually thinking the same thing! except I'm going for the 4 set bonus and still use the bis mask and chest
---
The only assumption I make on people is that as soon as you play the "TaLeNtEd StReAmEr" card, you opinion goes out the window for me. The chance of having a discussion is already over by then.
---
Make all assumptions you want on me, it honestly does not matter what you believe about me. I can however say that you hit basically every single major point regarding your assessment about me wrong. Im basically the opposite of what you describe me as.
---
Anyway, Asmongold is good at what he does, and has a huge audience. That is talent.
---
Lemme guess.... You still waiting for those 4 Level 60's to this day? :D
---
Similar situation here. Playing from Japan on US server, will be going home for the holidays at the end of the year.  I’m considering opening a ticket preemptively to inform them that I’ll be back home for a few weeks, just to cover all my bases... 🤔
---
Oof
---
Lol if you think a feral druid will be DPSing dungeons.  Most of the time tanks are either gished with a shaman or two pets or you wait forever for one.  Yeah you might be able to DPS when a paladin or something joins but otherwise you'll be tanking.  Forcing people to take you in a much less needed role when you can fill a much harder to find role is just selfishness.
---
Is this some kind of warlock joke I'm too priest to understand?
---
Is survival hunter viable for wPvP and the future BGs? I love to pvp, but i just made a hunter to make money to fund a warrior. But i'm really liking the hunter.
---
Altholic btw.
---
Well that's not the GMs decision.  They're in triage at that point, trying to figure out how to deal with the problem.  Probably better to port out an alliance than have the server crash like with the Asmon one a while back.
---
Could you share the UI? Looks sick!
---
I'd rather be 3rd or 4th tank anyways, then you can DPS most of the time!
---
You'll still get tank gear, but just a little slower.
---
Personal preference here.  
---
I enjoy 2H fury personally as I think improved demo shout is nice while tanking and piercing howl has actually been very helpful at times.  
---
Increased Crit is nice for additional threat.  
---
That said missing out on tactical mastery is a bit of a pain.  
---
No reason to go prot until you’re tanking the 60 dungeons, so like level 58 or 59.
---
Yeah, just use auctionator xD
---
Ally has level 55 quest in nethergarde i think
---
hOw CaN yOu HaVe A fUlL sEt WhEn I aM nOt EvEn 60?????
---
You must be a layer abuser and cheater!!1!!
---
Now for real: Nice and congrats!
---
And we're going to be seeing a lot more of that .1% in phase 2.
---
During leveling? Absolutely yes.
---
For high level instances I feel this is something that should ideally be talked about before. As a tank I will usually tell others when I am looking for off-spec items to prevent drama during the run. But I don't think it is morally wrong to be interested in DPS items, just because you happen to fill the tank spot. Otherwise it would become even harder to fill that role.
---
Pls no bite daddy
---
I've seen a tank build with the arms talent "impale" (something like 17/3/31 iirc)
---
Did someone try this, and does it give really a meaningful damage increase compared to the more usual (for me) 11/5/35
---
Yes, but using pounce also means less damage, so I don't know, maybe it evens out? Maybe if you're attacking something that will be harder to take down, a pounce, a shred, a faerie fire and an auto or two might be worth the start then.
---
But whats it stand for?
---
Just carry Freedom of Action potions and Swiftness Potions and you pretty much counter every class.
---
No he isn't
---
tf you on about
---
I couldn't tell you, I don't use Kui.  
---
I use ShestakUI as a UI replacement and it has everything, it supports RMH without config.
---
Greedy people piss me off. "I won't run this boss because he doesnt drop this BIS item"

"I will only join if everyone passes HoJ for me" 
---
Shit like that is my pet peeves. Don't be greedy and you should be okay :-)
---
i can he that DING sound of him leveling up already
---
Arms at low level, Fury end game. Tact Mastery/Anger Mgmt are a must have for tanking.
---
Isn't it the one that tells you to go talk to the horde warrior?
---
FYI any server that is high to full pop have two layers, medium is one so while there are less people over all there is probably about the same amount on the single layer.
---
Feels like a wasted debuff slot
---
I played Warrior in WotLK and Mage in Cata/MoP, playing priest in Classic and the one thing that is standing out to me:
---
In a PvP setting I feel like so many priest talents are good it's hard to choose or build badly. You can hybrid holy Main with disc or shadow for some interesting things, you can hybrid shadow main with disc (ps is Shadowform a necessity? Feels like you could do mainly Shadow with no shadowform and dip holy too)...
---
The one thing that is of interest to me is: what's better for damage: Spiritual Guidance or Darkness?
---
Rogues=Delta Force
---
Tanks=Marines
---
Hunters=Snipers 
---
Mages=
---
Priests=
---
Warlocks=
---
This is what I feel some people aren't too keen on.  With the demands for that kind of content, all resources should be a concerted effort.
---
Whatever the equipment demand is, the guild should be producing it to help with the needs of the raids.
---
This map is so impressive that it causes my reddit app to crash every time I zoom in for the details. Well done
---
&gt;Lol if you cede your stake on a 500g item, you are essentially giving that player 500g of utility.
---
No, because you don't own it.
---
&gt;The person who class fits is not entitled to the item. 
---
Yes they are, because that's blizzard's intended system.
---
&gt;It provides them 500g of utility, as it would anybody in the party. They have no higher claim to need than anyone else in the party.
---
Yes they do, because that's Blizzard's intended system. Nobody gives a shit about your gold.
---
You can call spitting RP character interaction, immersive, satisfying, whatever.... the one thing that no sane person would ever call it, no matter the context, is “wholesome”.
---
If you want to min/max orc is the way to go and it will make the journey to end game gearing easier. If you really fucking like undead, then play undead
---
LOL, the sandals of the insurgents did not age well in this day and age.
---
Something like a clothie I’ll ravage&gt;rake&gt;rip&gt; claw/keep rake up/ shred to ferocious bite. Something like a plate wearer or a rouge I’ll do pounce because the ravage is a little less devastating for someone with armor and the long bleed on a rouge helps to keep them from getting a restealth, but after the pounce it’s the same, rake&gt;claw/shred&gt;rip&gt;claw/keep rake up/shred to ferocious bite.
---
Looks like a Weakaura to remind the player they haven't got Battle Shout buffed.
---
No no no, you just don't understand!   
---
When a mage tops the damage meters, it's because of raw skill pressing Frostbolt or Blizzard, and when they don't it's because they are under geared or under leveled and that is the only reason.   
---
When a mage wins a fight in PvP it's because of their incredible individual talent, mechanics, and decision making! How else do you think they got Rival on their mains some seasons? If they lose to anyone in PvP, it's obviously because &lt;CLASS&gt; is broken and the bad guy just got lucky RNG.
---
What is the best way to produce threat against many enemies after the demo &amp; battle shout fixes? (e.g. the dwarf packs at the end of Uldaman)
---
Was just about to invite you to r/classicwowscreenshots again, but recognized that asthetic. Carry on, my dude.
---
Aha, so it’s the “m’urica only country in the world” thing? Gotcha.
---
Yeah, I can 100% assume people don't want to waste hours trying to clear Molten Core.  It just seems obvious, IDK why you think guilds would want to run people who objectively slow them down.
---
Hey buddy, how do shamans solo farm dirwmaul? I've never heard of this. Very interested! Thank you.
---
Mograine EU PvP... around 250 for pants and around 100 for gloves. The Devilsaur mafia is strong :D
---
Leathers are like 18g/ piece.
---
It’s such a small difference but if we really wanted to min max, couldn’t you argue that if you were specced 3/5 flurry in the bm tree then a faster attack speed pet is more likely to proc its attack speed buff more often than a slower attacking pet if you were to spec into other useful abilities in the marksman tree (hunters mark, scattering shot, etc)? However I guess if we were in a more mobile fight then we would want a slower, harder hitting attack wouldn’t we.
---
I ran a main tank and build leader. Was a part time job on the side. So happy to kick back and play a rogue this time around
---
Understandable
---
Perfection
---
yea but as you said depending on spec some got tier items come from MC that you wont be replacing till you kill Cthun....
---
Sure had me fooled there, buddy. Grow up
---
I mean I’m not sure how you can make laugh and love sound the same regardless of accent without being way off base.
---
Should be using rend at all past LVL 40?
---
What’s the helm that Asmon uses? (The Nice looking red one) and how do you get it?
---
I disagree, Warriors are the kings of tanking, even if they aren’t specced into prot. There’s obviously a tanking shortage, and there’s really no one else to tank in higher levels. People have a right to ask if you don’t mind to tank.
---
Yes that was the joke.
---
This is the best druid tanking weapon (for mitigation) until TBC.
---
its not bragging, its just a small clip showing how strong warrior damage is. I thought just "wow cool" when i saw it. There are tons of PvP videos on youtube with music and special effects, THAT is bragging. This doesnt even have sound.
---
HITEMMMUP
---
Ghostwolf of biting their mobs and then licking them. 
---
Gotta lick them right before you leave.
---
Honestly, that would probably be a good solution from their perspective, but they'll probably be too stubborn to do it.  "You think you do".
---
But you're just cycling in 3 mains who have not cleared it that week. The group consisted of 22 alts who had already cleared it, and 3 mains who had not cleared it that week. How is that an exploit? The 22 alts don't receive loot because they already cleared it, only the 3 mains get access to the loot because they haven't cleared it.
---
Yeah besides the Kodo what else can I use?
---
It will be solved in time. From my understanding they don’t have the same amount of service desk reps as before. Then these kind of matters start taking a lot more time since they require manual review.
---
Lol he actually gonna be fallen once that acc gets banned
---
Crazy dwarf in Morgan's Vigil, Burning Steppes. Not sure what his story is though, like why he's...like this lol
---
But this isn't a job it's a video game.
---
Gotta say OP this confused the fuck out of me when I bought my epic mount. I was expecting to buy the epic mount for like 80g and pay 800g for advanced training. I'm almost positive that's how it worked when I played vanilla.
---
On shazzrah they’re floating around ~5–15g. If you can get 40g for them I’d sell, but otherwise I’d just hold until phase 2 or 3
---
Whoah, that's insane. What did you do for a living back then, if I may ask? I can absolutely not even imagine where I would get the spare time from to play 12hr a day.
---
Also really interesting to read your perspective of inspection. Do you play the game with certain goals in your head for fulfilment or can you enjoy the here-and-now too?
---
Has Blizzard released the numbers of server population/cap?
---
Like when the server is listed as "full" does that mean there are 2k people on 4k, 6k?
---
Same with High, Medium, Low?
---
Honestly I can’t wait for phase two when no layering so you can raid more opposite faction city’s
---
Where is the bragging? Am I not seeing a comment?
---
I use a separate chat tab for LFG.  That way if I decide I want to join a group, I can see what's already scrolled passed.
---
About 90% of the time, when I load into the game, all my ? macros show as ? on the action bars instead of showing the actual icon and tooltip they should.
---
I typically do a \`/reload\` and that fixes it for the session.  
---
Does anyone know a permanent fix? Is this a bug with the Classic WoW client?
---
/reload
---
As for the constant fix, I don't really know, curious aswell.
---
Ayyy you guys are on my KoS list! Always seem to have players who would go out of way for a kill lol.   
---
If ya see a horde hunter in Extreme it might be me :)
---
The best way to gauge where the average player is at is the LFG channel. Seems like ZF/BRD arena is the most common which means average level is probably 50. Average is not casual. Average is "I play this game almost everyday for an hour." Casual would be "I play this game for a few hours on the weekend". Casuals seem to still be in SM.
---
Against what?
---
30g for something you'll be able to replace within like 3 levels is ridiculously pricey. You're better off saving your money.
---
Eh master race for Horde will always be tauren.
---
I could see first boss of 2 or 3 wings being pug'd, I remember the first two bosses being not too hard. But man even some of the trash pulls were nasty
---
Good can we add kurrinaxx to the list as well so we can enjoy some world pvp thank you
---
In large wpvp fights at 60 the servers just lags out and you cant do shit.
---
Correct I assume. I do the same thing but I keep the icons much smaller and more discrete right below my character. Anything you want to have a reminder of without having to move your eyes too far down so you can focus on movement, eg sunder armor stacks on target, when charge/intercept is ready, etc.
---
Try to find someone on discord willing to sell it to you on neutral AH?
---
2004 was a magical time
---
&gt;Then why is there specs in the first place? Why does the Warrior have a talent tree named "Protection" if not to tank?
---
Same reason Pure DPS classes have multiple talent trees/specs despite being DPS only. Arms, Fury, and Protection are all different ways to tweak the tank base to your particular style, while still being a tank. As a tank, you're not only about survivability, but also threat generation and clear speed. Protect shines in large group content. But Arms and fury are better for small group content.
---
Iam 60 and dngs are fine as tank with arms, but I'd like to go pug raids as 2h fury until the guild is ready. Is it not possible to keep Tact Mastery/ Anger Mgmt with fury specc?
---
I feel so much less worse about refusing to group with warriors after this thread lol
---
Tactical dot.
---
Have the same issue since launch
---
From one of those guides
---
&gt; Obtaining a Hand of Justice for the 20 Attack Power will be hard as it has a low drop rate and other classes such as Warrior and Rogue want this item too. It is actually far better for those classes too with it's proc effect so be careful who you may Need Roll this off of.
---
That trinket is mediocre at best for you and amazing for rogues and warriors.
---
Getting flamed is the crash course!
---
Same thing happened to me back in 2004.
---
No. Not on mobs. Yes if you pvp rogues.
---
eh maybe i just missed them
---
Honnestly, if some edgemaster's handguards drop, that passion about the game shit can fuck right off. And we dont split the money because of the inconvenience obviously. The time it takes for the item to sell and having to mail gold back to the group, keeping track of who it was, noone wants to do that, never gonna work. you won heres your prize, the end. Your reasons are all emotional, you should start reconsidering that shit when you get to 60 and real loot start dropping.
---
I dont understand the while concept about end game raids, ele shamans no, feral druids no, warriors only tanks because we prefer rogues. Then you roll a mage but there are too many and you might not get a spot, same with rogues. 
---
Find a good non hardcore guild and play what you love.
---
Just need couple items that you "need" for your nature resistance set and nobody will argue. Only do so if the group wipes you too often.
---
Yup. A warrior with a priest is unstoppable. A warrior by himself is stoppable.
---
Its way more often than 10s. 300 people together and player updates are sent to and from 300 people. 300 spread out? No other player needs to know the data of the other if they dont interact.
---
Are you on Pagle?
---
And they get to get all gear, because no locks in raids lol
---
We've got this weird tradition of preparing for a raid by looking at YouTube videos, reading tactics and theories then discuss like we're some scientific geniuses, farming or buying the best consumables/gems/enchants like we're made of gold and then realising it makes no difference as we wipe over and over whilst whispering each other and blaming other people
---
The trash drops aren’t bad either
---
I'm a warrior tank and I never invite warriors even if I don't need loot because the majority are unfortunately, assholes in my experience. Every time I want to give dps warriors a second chance I immediately regret it.
---
Chiming in that I also have this issue and have not found a fix.
---
120 for legs
---
80 hands
---
All items goes to 1 guy
---
So with that, would it make such a difference that if im orc, i dont have to farm some piece of gear because im fine with the bonus? Like, undead needs an extra piece of gear to farm for insurance sale while orc can worry about one less piece? Sorry for the many questions. I’m gonna be googling stuff in the meantime as well.
---
Okay. That I will agree with. But it is not what you said earlier.
---
&gt;but you can dps better than other meme specs
---
Were you not calling hotw/ns a meme spec? 
---
It really doesn't matter tbh. I'm only still arguing because you insulted my reading comprehension.
---
Why do it doesn’t affect you in any way shape or form 
---
If I see a group and they reserve an item I need I just join another group 
---
It’s basic group advertising that doesn’t negatively affect anyone in any way
---
I had this with my hunter. Now with my warlock same macros for pet it never happens. Weird.
---
Works for me! You can also do Aspect of the Pack as well. Thanks for this
---
That's where I am kinda torn though, I didn't dislike the warrior-just felt like taking a little break just b/c that SM grind was so tedious. And we all know warriors level best through dungeons, idk just wasn't expecting to like a lock so much since I have never played one. Really throws a wrench into things!
---
Good idea, I may do that myself.
---
There's about a dozen servers that have already removed layering, and all but the highest pop are down to 2 max.
---
SoL
---
That's more "average currently logged in" than "average across the entire active player base".
---
Someone who plays, as you said, "a few hours on the weekend" probably isn't in LFG on a day-to-day basis.
---
I've also noticed black lotus and other nodes dont exist since realm pops are 10x vanilla size.   Maybe we need dynamic respawns since realm pops aren't vanilla
---
Ya, that was my thought on it. I remember trying this back in I think TBC and had success in rarer items but simply couldn't keep the price up on higher volume items. I think there are people who stockpile stuff as well, then dump it when the price goes up. I lack that kind of patience, but they don't!
---
I usually level a lock first and send alt gear to warrior to level. Warrior is more gear intense to level and it will make leveling warrior easier. Also lock gets free mount.
---
Really it isn't though. I've noticed boomer is used for shit that kids don't understand....like having a job, paying taxes or shit, having any additional responsibilities other than school, masterbation and video games
---
2h tanking is actually very good and viable, especially below 60. But those warrs need to know some stuff.. The very basic mistake they do is that they stand still. They need to move around a bit, so mobs don't hit them all the time. And obviously they need to know when is the time to switch to shield (and use macros for that to swap back and forward). Those are just the 2 very basic ones.     
---
TL:DR 2h tanking is good, but harder to execute.
---
Imo, hunter can be frustrating to learn to pvp with, until you really get the hang of the dead zone, and how to avoid letting opponents exploit it. With that said, to answer yoir question, Ive personally never been a fan of deep SV. For pvp Ive always preferred BM, 31/0/20.
---
Lets be honest though, if someone is already 60 and has MC/Ony on farm, they are not lacking for time to play. It is replacing one "timesink" (levelling) with another (honour grind)
---
Also, I think a lot of people will share your mindset, which will make it more worthwhile to get ahead of the pack on the honour grind. World PvP naturally ebbs and flows, as well as there being fewer people to kill at off peak times. This is more forgiving in terms of taking a break and not falling so far behind people no lifing, because there are always BG's 24/7 with crossrealm.
---
Not to mention that how much time and money someone has spent doesn't necessarily determine the price. The rest of the market does. In this case it will be how much time/money it takes boosters to level a character for you, minus the risk discount.
---
It's the same trap people selling their modded cars fall into. Spending 10k on a custom and very original paint job of an anthropomorphic wolf howling at the Moon won't add 10k to the value of the car.
---
Sounds like a commie guild
---
That is unquestionably gambling, and a completely difference discussion.
---
However “pay to win” can be twisted to suit an agenda, as you are doing.
---
Roll a joint or take a dab. Instant resett.
---
All i can picture is Dwight yelling "MICHAEL!!!" as Jim plays a prank on him. This is a common market tactic.
---
Deposit is like a few silver at most, it's a level 19 item. You'd take a 5% cut if someone was to buy it, but since you're mostly doing it to get offers you'd be happy if someone did buy it for 800g.
---
Spy is more than a list of names, it also notifies you when the player is detected automatically which of course a notebook doesnt do.
---
Are you accounting for 35% base mana cost return and splash heal?
---
This is kind of my concern actually! Gearing on orc might be easier since im not so focused on getting stuff to up my hit rating? I just need to google this stuff lol
---

---
British love sounds pretty damn similar to laugh.
---
Feels about the same when you nut and she keep sucking.
---
That doesn't make sense.
---
wrong sub
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
Ofcourse, just saying the bonus is not useless and actually worth a few dmg/dps.
---
or, here me out now, NO
---
Except, if you’re demanding new content ASAP, that can only mean you’ve already chewed through everything the game has to offer and are now bored.
---
So I was accurate in thinking locks are underpopulated? After leveling one I cant see why there are so few of them
---
I'd add to that to mention counterspell is an amazing tool to help tanks pull
---
* After the tank aggros and an enemy caster isn't moving forward, counterspell their attack so they're forced to melee and run to the tank to die with the rest.
---
I did arms till ZF went sword and board in ST
---
Download the latest version of the Fukui client. In the bottom right corner there’s a drop down where you can select “retail” or “Classic” and it’ll allow you to update the respective elvui (or whatever tukui addons).
---
Man, those self indulgent tank posts haven't made their mark yet I guess.
---
So much mis information about warrior tanks.  Seriously listen to the dude's facetious post above you, its true.  Protection is a dead spec (for try hards at least) until MC and not using a 2 hander will make the above threat problems even worse.
---
The real 30% post missing in the above is people bitching about how another class should be played when they have no idea what they are talking about.
---
?????
---
&gt; I dont want to hear nO ChAnGEs from the wow classic fanboys
---
Sounds like you need to get back to /r/wow instead
---
I agree, rebalance human racial as well to work as an extra trinket. Cause why not?
---
Definitely blinding the warr, sprint away to leave combat, and then following him in stealth until he engages a mob and then gank him and /spit
---
Yeah and then he tells you to go do some quest that was red to me at 51 so i didn’t really read it lol
---
Or I did, dunno. Some of them might be chains, I abandoned the khadgar questline in Swamp for one. Didn't have anything else in nethergarde.
---
You won't be able to use anything else until max level. At that point there are some drops and later PVP-related rewards.
---
As a tauren you can't use other factions mounts, except for orc wolves and only at a later patch version I believe. But even if you could it would require exaltet reputation with them, which you wouldn't achieve until reaching max level und putting some effort into it.
---
Basially for the moment get your Kodo.
---
Pretty sure you're after the "Humor" tag
---
i am currently at 10 days played at level 54 but i am done with fishing, cooking, first aid, blacksmithing + armor smithing and mining. i have mined all of my materials myself as well.
---
i have also done all quests expect for silverpine and ashenvale as a horde so i am well along my goal of 60 and 300 in all skills (that means weapon skill aswell) and all quests done. not really intrested in dungeons or raids however.
---
Tbh I think you should always need on a BoE epic or even blue. If someone ends up actually needing it and is willing to equip it on the spot then you can always trade it.
---
If your group greeds you're just asking to get ninjad
---
Ten Storms realm?
---
nO ChAngEs
---
I share your experience on Gandling.
---
I would roll horde on this server though. The allys seems to get ganked fairly often.
---
Literally all the priest had to do was walk away after he charged in on the rogue, wait for recklessness then they could have stomped him in two seconds.
---
I don't know why the priest stood there and smited, but if your "EPIC PVP TAKEDOWN" involves your enemy playing at the level of a literal bot then it's not interesting.
---
It's just the PVP version of "Ben Shapiro DESTROYS liberal" clickbait.
---
Good players can also farm a lot more efficiently than a protection warrior  that is speced for raiding. Also, consider the prot warriors gold for respec between raids if he has no resources to help him farm materials for consumables, or the time to  consistently dungeon grind to make gold every week, before raid.
---
I mean, the first comment you replied to was me literally just talking about "you can also do decent damage". Not sure how else I would reply lol. Not like it was 50 comments ago
---
Druid dps in general is pretty meme spec, even with cat being decently viable.
---
Never experienced this problem fortunately. Does this occur when your macros start with /showtooltip “name” ?
---
afaik as a tauren you can only use kodos and wolves
---
Not sure if trolling or being serious.
---
lmao tru
---
Not OP but I would imagine they were most likely: 
---
* Middle school/High school student on summer break 
---
* College student with a flexible courseload 
---
* Unemployed 
---
* Employed but with a severe amphetamine habit
---
12hrs a day is certainly doable, especially over a limited amount of time like a summer vacation. It's just not feasible for most people.
---
Ah yes a rogue convincing everyone to greed roll, what could possibly go wrong
---
Use a /target macro.
---
It’s absurd that you are actually arguing an addon like Spy is “ruining the experience.”
---
Yes. And the 35% is only on 25% of the casts, so it average out to 8%.
---
It isn't against the rules to roll on an upgrade, but you're a dick if you're needing on a 3% drop rate item with an amazing proc you can't even activate, just because it gives you a minimal AP boost.
---
Jfc that is a mess, isn't it? I hadn't leveled in ages on retail and went ahead and leveled a nightborne and it was so confusing. I definitely won't be doing that again any time soon.
---
You're not his guildie or his employee.  You could and should leave when you think you're in over your head with a tank that can't adjust to your limitations.  Just make up some shitty excuse and leave the group. 
---
This shit happens.  No matter how geared you get, you'll get a group where  they're toxic for various reasons.  I have straight up bubble-hearthed out of a group mid-wipe while giving everyone the finger, because they're asstards.
---
Yes, as far as I can tell, this only affects macros that have the ? icon selected and start with 
---
    #showtooltip
---
or 
---
    #showtooltip Some Spell
---
But that’s so many! I love the fact that all the guildless ones showed the finger to everybody and ended up creating a guild out of outcasts. Either that or my imagination went a bit wild over your comment.
---
But viper strong is just fine right?
---
When you pay 50 abo, it's fair !
---
Hey i played a memers too in GW2 while that lasted.
---
I left in season 4 or 5 due to the salinity and toxicity (and I played almost exclusively UNRANKED).  If it has gotten even worse than it was then... I am not sure I can imagine it.
---
Will a faster ranged weapon allow me to pull faster?  I feel like if this is the case then you might as well choose the fastest weapon regardless of dps.
---
Damn bruh.  200g at 40 and 78 bags.
---
Ive played the game before and im at 50 gold and like 48 bag slots.
---
That realization of sucking at the game.
---
"Don't listen to this person"
---
"Raiding is resto tho" 
---
??? Lol.
---
Nice looking red one? That's not saying much. Can you post a picture, or at least mention class/level?
---
Idk man, I'm casual and hit 60 a week ago. My second character is now lvl 47. I also have my epic mount, full BIS, and maxed professions. /s
---
It comes into its own right, once you have enough gear to have +9 hit, good defense and still get a lot of crit like having DFT, Onslaught, some T2.5 etc.
---
In the beginning it's worse than deep prot TPS wise while also being worse in mitigation. 
---
You lack crit, and if you get the required crit, you are a mana dump for your healer.
---
you want no deadzone, play a mage..
---
also, don't forget you get a melee weapon (or two); get a big 2hander and use it when you have to!
---
won't comment on the fd issue, since I've not played vanilla
---
the deadzone is working as it should. I even saw shots released from &lt;8y (aimed shot finished casting, probably earlier, due to lag), while an enemy was running to you.
---
Have a nice weekend!
---
I'm lvl35. Kinda happy with a slightly slower schedule too!
---
You do realize that DB update and sending player's datas to others are 2 different things, right?
---
It's not my mindset.  I'm already ahead and will continue to stay there.  I just have more realistic expectations.  And I think your first point is at least partially wrong, because a lot of those players are starting to only log on to raid now.  I'm already having trouble finding people outside of prime time to do anything.  Sure, some of those people will be back and excited for pvp, but a surprising amount only seem to be interested in the pve gear grind, and I just don't think classic will be sustainable for people with that mindset.
---
Also, the honor decay is going to make it very challenging to rank up with only world pve on a server with layering removed.  Once you kill someone enough you get literally no honor.  The people you will see frequently will be the ones also trying to rank up, so I think world pvp that will actually be meaningful towards gaining rank is going to be a lot lower than people expect.  If that's your goal, it's really important to be on one of the very high pop servers.
---
If you are a prot warrior speced for raiding, and everyone is doing strat Live simply for orb/gold farm, it is a pretty common method to give the first orb to the tank. However if people need them for true faith robes, or enchants, obviously they will want to be apart of another group, as sometimes only one will drop, sometimes none...
---
Anyway i recommend if you do reserve, just reserve the first orb drop, and all others can be rolled on freely. I also recommend finding a group that has tome for two or more runs.
---
For some reason i never think of paladins as a tank/DPS. Dont know why so please don't take offense. Back in the day in our guild we had maybe a couple of prot paladins but they were alts iirc.
---
This sounds like it might be it. I figure it's because I start castng a fraction of a second before I actually click the target I want to heal and I accidentally self cast out something.

Some zone to zone pathways are not very clear on this image. For example it looks like there isn't even a path from Hillbrad Foothills to The Hinterlands. Would be nice if these in between zone pathways would be made more clearly.

Let's give warlocks demonic portal while we are at it! Cause fuck it why not

I have my own personality, but I still like to agree with Asmongold when I can because I'm a fan.

They're not  catering to the lowest common denominator though.. they're catering to the vast majority and not to the 0.3% of the player base who have nothing else to do but play classic wow 14 hours a day.
---
no u
---
Lol I think we are just talking past each other. All I'm saying is that hotw/ns is a legit healing/tanking spec and definitely not a dps spec for group content.

Let us fight no longer, druid brother. &lt;3

Gotta admit I'm slightly bitter about it but I've learned to live with it. It's kind of like when Nintendo named the Wii. It's a junky. Eventually you just get desensitized.
---
From what I've seen and researched myself, the benefit of having spirit completely plummets in the 30-40 range, and if you can't have 2 sets you're better off stacking str and eating a shitton of food and bandaging. It's not even that bad either, I grinded 54-55 and I only had to eat for 10-15 sec per minute.
---
Yes, it encases them in a freezing trap that isnt broken on damage that can shatter.
---
There is a reason it is so valuable. You can also wear 2 and the proc chance will stack.

I’m as casual as casual gets (main character is only level 28) and I’ve posted before that dungeon grinding is not in the cards for me, but I have found time to run a few while leveling and still enjoy tanking greatly. So my question is; is there a spec I can run between 50-60 (in about a year probably lol) that will allow me to tank the occasional dungeon for gear upgrades but that won’t ruin my damage output when I go back to solo grinding xp/gold on my normal (read: very limited in time) days? I see suggestions telling warriors to respec into a proper tanking spec around 55 and staying in dungeons until 60 to get a leg up on pre-bis, whereas for me pre-bis will be the best gear i could hope to achieve period because raiding is out of the question for me until maybe next summer. I need to be able to go solo and I understand how not optimal that is but its my reality. I enjoy the hell out of this game, its been wonderful being back home in Azeroth even on this limited basis of less than 5 hours of play a week. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you warriors.

I think that has more to do with your native tongue being German rather than British enunciation.

The 'idea' of wPvP always seems appealing, but the reality is that it's mostly just a way to grief or engage in severely unbalanced fights. No one's ever going to start a fight they think they'll lose, so most wPvP content is overlevelling/geared people picking fights on lowbies, or groups picking fights with single players. Some people enjoy this as they're the ones engaging in it, but if you don't enjoy or plan to go around actively partaking it just makes the rest of the experience more stressful. I get killed about 5-10 times a day and have done every day since launch. I've never been attacked by anyone that wasn't skulled, and 90% were mages. It's been the same for my friends also playing on the same server. Sometimes it's not too bad, but you have to be willing to accept it's gonna be awful sometimes and if you don't have much time (work, family, other commitments) then it really sucks spending a day at work to get home to being camped. But on the other hand, the game feels very 'safe' on a PvE server and once you're level 60 with a decent bit of gear you never have to worry or prepare before leaving town. 
---
Busy/quiet servers have pros and cons. Busy servers will be easier to find groups in, feel more 'alive' and are more likely to last a while. But questing zones are full, grinding zones are full and wPvP is impossible to avoid if you're on a PvP server. Also, they can have queues which again sucks if you have other time commitments.
---
Emptier servers will be easier to quest in, less chance of being ganked and no queuing. But grouping might be slower, the economy might not as good (less total gold in circulation, harder to find buyers). Plus it could end up dead (although barring the very low population servers this seems unlikely. You're best of going down the middle and looking for a medium/high population (high during peak times, medium in the daytime/late night).
---
I don’t mean to be a dick, but as someone in full pre Raid BiS what’s there left now? Other than farming gold, which honestly isn’t very enticing imho.
---
Hunters shouldn’t even be in the game. 
---
They were a last minute addition and have **No** place in the lore.
---
I think it was estimated to be over 10k+, something like 12.5k maybe. But they increased server cap at some point and I'm not sure if these numbers were before or after the change.
---
Just reading this thread has made it clear to me the guy has no idea what he’s doing, i think it’s safe to assume he’s a new (WoW) player (no offense intended)
---
I only agree about the feign death part rest is vanilla and should stay that way.
---
He's playing wow.  You are playing wow.  Same game.  Why is your game right and his wrong?
---
lol go back to retail
---
Your toxic attitude is unsurprising considering your love for the dumpster fire president.
---
Yes, they did the first time for me :(
---
Remember though that he 6% hit only applies to lvl 63 mobs (bosses). This does NOT apply to 60 mobs and only to a lesser extent to 61-62. That's why edgemasters are superior when fighting bosses, however devilsaur is still better when doing trash leading up to the boss.
---
Moonglow and Tranquil Spirit are your bread and butter for a main healing spec. Everything else is up to. Granted, those talents are pretty deep and don't leave all that much wiggle room.
---
if they are putting up their sales for 24 hours they would only need to check every couple of hours, outside of course when they are logged off to sleep, a change like this does not happen instantly and is not cheap, but if you have the time and money to commit to it, the outcome can be very profitable.

Check ingredients Goblin Sapper Charge, stock up on those :D

I mean, if you're a druid wouldn't you want to swim to stay one with nature? Also, when doing the quest to get aqua travel form, how do you rp that? You have to swim all the way to the fissure. I'm not trolling, I'm actually curious. I've never tried WoW RP
---
That’s the one! The raging berserker helm
---
Holy crap! Thats one of those vision Warlock show to make their enemies run in fear?
---
thank you for your answer
---
I farm this on my mage. Use an Azure Silk Belt for swim speed and I dont kill the mobs, just sheep them and swim away so they drop aggro and protect the spot to slow down the competition. :-)
---
Got to level 50, went away on business recently. 1 month ban. Argued with 2 GM’s and they basically told me to stop opening tickets and disconnected the chats on me.
---
Worst part is I am an officer of a guild. That needs me for our MC runs, which they are in now.
---
Really upsetting. I can’t even make a new character because of how frequent I travel for business.
---
I take it you didnt see there were two separate waves of attackers.

I think it's fun, also to read the chat. It's like watching it with others.

---
looks fine to me
---
Are you trolling?
---
When soloing, you’re not doing a significant amount of weapon damage, so use rank 1. In a group, evaluate the balance of weapon to magic damage, and the healing capability of your group, then decide if the reduced armor is worth it.
---
Damage isn't a huge problem when ur grinding as a cat druid, it's much faster to faerie fire the mob from range while running toward it so you meet in the middle and fight.  After 2-3 mobs you then shift and heal yourself full, shift back and rinse and repeat.  The time it takes to kill 2-3 mobs should be enough for your mana to regen from the healing.  If it's not quite enough, throw the odd innervate on yourself when you need to.
---
This way you're always killing.  Going in to stealth and using an opener means you have to sneak to the mob in stealth which wastes a lot of time.
---
I believe you need to put the /equip shield on the next line below
---
Equip shield first.
---
Have you ever considered that they might just agree with him, and aren't copying his opinions? I think I just blew your mind ♥
---
If you are going to try to kill people Shadow form would be the best bet because you get a damage buff and incoming damage is reduced.  And Darkness is the way to go for pvp damage since you don't have to stack spirit to gain the effect.  Most of your damage should be from shadow spells smite and holy fire have long cast times and if it gets counterspelled you are locked out of healing yourself.
---
Who cares? Grow up.
---
Do you know that Warriors, Rogues have even bigger deadzone? I dont see them complaining?  
---
It is what it is. You picked this class with all its pros and so little cons. This is one of them. Want to have more QoL changes? Go to retail. I believe it is what you are looking for.  
---
Classic is all about the inconvenience  it "provided". I am not a "nO cHaNgEs" fanboy (i would still see dual spec and summoning stones working + some raid QoL HS/food/water)  
---
This is how this class is played.  
---
Feign Death doesn't make you invulnerable, and even if it not that reliable its still SOMETHING. You can reset your aggro with 1 button. You can survive MOST of the encounters by pressing 1 button. This is convenience that you should be thankful for. I would opt for a 30-60 minutes FD cooldown. On par with SoulStone (that makes you still pay for the durability loss through death).
---
In my opinion, he's pretty cringey and really doom and gloom about like everything. And cynical AF. I forgot I even used to subscribe to him (back when I was just subbing to anything) and I can't even make it through his videos anymore. Maybe it's just me but I find him annoying.
---
Imagine trying to continue to stir up drama when the account is actually 6 years old and has 10K+ karma

---
Is a 30/0/21 ele/resto build viable for raid healing, and will I have a hard time in spvp or regular pvp? I need to commit to a main and I'm having a really hard time. I have a 35 hunter and 20 shaman.. but I also want a mage priest and rogue lol idk what to do.
---
You da real mvp!
---
So, I dpsed Uldaman. I was cat mostly but would pop into bear to tank things that would peel off the tank from time to time or pop out to innervate the priest, hurricane scorpids, etc. My dps was half the two hunters. I was level 42 for most of the instance. My spouse which is a hunter is the same level (has the epic fire bow), and the other hunter was level 45. However, even though my dps was crap, my total damage was in second place and not really that far behind the level 45 hunter. This was kinda strange. But I don't have to wait for mana like the hunters. But I also notice the same thing when I tank. My dps will be lower than the dpses but my total damage will be first or second place.
---
how exactly does someone having more gold than you affect you?
---
Doesnt realize 
---
That hunters do all the special mechanics in a boss fight.
---
Like kiting a raid boss around naxx
---
Maybe here at least. Horde monster...
---
As the others have said, consumables. Also people need to enchant their new epics.
---
When I was younger I used to roll like this, never really had any end game characters because I'd constantly make new ones. Now I have the opposite problem, after investing so much time in one character the thought of having to level again, grind out professions again, grind rep again etc is enough to stop me from ever making an alt.
---
Didnt watch the video due to too many negative comments about it being a chronic whiner on every sub you posted this, but ontopic:
---
This summer one of my favorite games (worlds adrift) had to close down in beta, because the servercosts for massive online games are not future-proof with the oldskool 'one time purchase'-deal. I hated them for not including micropayments to keep the game alive, and since then i look different at certain micropayments, monthly payments and other practices to maintain future servers and updates. Ofcourse they go way too far and greedy, but you cant expect games with current serversize-requirements and costs to be oldskool '1 time purchase' deals
---
Had a fun encounter with two hordies doing the stv elite ogres, two of us, two of them. We helped them and one of em left immediately after but the other stayed for the long haul, he waited for the boss to respawn, was like a 10min wait lol

I really enjoyed HotS, but I haven’t played since Blizzard screwed over their esports teams.  I didn’t even play in ranked matches myself, I just enjoyed it casually.  But just morally it felt wrong to play the game after what Blizzard did to the people trying to support it.

Drag the button to your bar and clickedyclick!
---
Guess you better be setting a side a lot of Spell Power gear so you can relatively kill things as hpally
---
They would of invited more people and tested layers if that was the point of beta.
---
Looks like at your level it's 44 agi is 1%crit. There's not really a point to know what the ratio is at each level because you won't be that level for long.
---
you must stable your current pet go tame the new pet fight with it until you get a chat message "you learned the spell \*\*\*\*\*\*" after that abandon the random pet and go pick your other one back up. 
---
A lot of zones have stable masters near the inn in the main town.
---
Buy low sell high. Not exactly complicated. Knowing what items go for which prices is the key.
---
I went from 31-x-0 to 17-0-x after 40+. Mobs die slowly, and the little additional damage from Rend and the occasional crit + Impale help me not fall asleep when soloing a mob or two.
---
Yes, I know, I know, it's stupid. But for me, spending everything past Impale into the protection tree makes dungeon tanking so much less stressful.
---
I still wish we could the Second War factions of Humans, dwarves, high elves, and gnomes and then orcs, trolls, ogres, and goblins.
---
These are by far the best advice you can take.   
---
Just a few additional things came to my mind:   
---
\- if the mob health is \~15% stop casting frostbolt. big crit, execute, 5cp eviscerte etc. can happen and you wont be able to cast your fb or mob die while fb mid air and you loose precious mana. you can wand till the enemy dies or if theres other target and tank alrdy started to attack it, you can switch and cast fb. (by the time it lands tank will generate more then enough aggro)   
---
\- only use AoE spells if 4+ mobs around. it's safer to cc mobs and kill the remaining 1 by 1. with rouge or hunter in the group its even better since you can cc more.  
---
\- making food/water can take a LOT mana, be prepaired...  
---
\- get rdy to decurse. some of the curses can rly harm the party, either by dmg taken or dmg done. sometimes (in raid scene especially) decursing is more important than dealing damage, you don't have to be the top 1 on dmg meter.  
---
\- you can create each rank mana gem.
---
\+ pro tip: do your mage quests asap. even if its red. the rewards are really nice and can boost you a lot. (not like ww axe for warriors but after 16lvl im still using the wand)
---
You can stable your pet, go tame one with the ability you want to learn, use it until you learn the ability, then swap to the other and teach it the ability.
---
You can also completely abandon your old pet and grab and keep the new one, since it will probably be around your level, too.
---
At 40 I got a wolf from feralas which comes with all the arsenal: bite6, dash3, howl3.
---
But, if you wanna keep your current pet, use the stable as a buffer while you learn abilities with another pet.
---
No, I think artificially stretching it out for more than a year would be silly. I think there should be 3 months between each phase at most.
---
All of the content is known. Naxx and AQ will be cleared within 8 hours of their release. Let's just get on with it.
---
Got halfway through and then went Ohhhh
---
To add, they can ride one undead horsie though. The one that drops from Baron Rivendere.
---
You gotta target them first for that to work...

Tanaris was just as bad as STV pvp wise on my server.
---
Fortunately I'm already 52 and can basically just do dungeons on my way to 60. I remember questing being basically impossible on prime time. At least there was no reason as most time was just waiting. I bet currently questing is just not clever way to do as you just wait.. and wait... and wait to get all those mobs.
---
We got the eye as well this wednesday. We had already planned way before the launch that the eye will go to our ret. The funny thing is he was still 59 this wednesday and it was his first mc run - must be the luckiest pala alive :)

Some are good, others may be not. But you can surely get some inspiration from some of them...
---
Hi everyone!  I have a question regarding Druid tanking while leveling up and how to go about it.  
---
Right now I'm level 49 and have been hesitant to tank anything at all during Classic as I feel I don't have the tools that make me as effective as a Warrior.  Even though I've been leveling as Feral, I would prefer to heal the dungeons (even though I know it's not the most efficient, I love rolling Rejuv/Renew)).   When I try to get into small groups for Elite quests I try to stay in Bear to take the brunt of it and never seem to be able to keep aggro.  All it takes is for the initial Maul to miss/parried, which seems to always happen btw, and then I have to use Taunt to keep aggro while I try to build up rage.  I've got pretty much every talent in the Feral tree except Thick Hide, and 4/5 Furor so far.
---
Does anyone have any recommendations on how to get more confident in using my limited abilities to get initial aggro and keep it when handling 3-4 mobs so I can try tanking some dungeons?  When I hit 60 I'd like to be able to perform any role necessary and add as much value as possible.  When I first started playing during TBC we had Mangle, which was a Godsend comparatively :)
---
Just go arms, tactical mastery gives you all the flexibility you need to tank, damage taken isn't much of an issue in dungeons if you switch to a shield either constantly or on packs of 3+ mobs (depending on the skill / power of the healer), and if you find yourself taking a lot of damage - keep shield block up as much as possible. 
---
Alternatively Fury is also great for tanking while having good solo capabilities, due to the buffs you can get on getting hit by a crit (enrage / blood craze). It just lacks the flexibility of tactical mastery (i leveled till 42 with fury, tanking constantly between dps-soloing and then switched to arms for mortal strike, since it is easier to get a good weapon upgrade for 2handers during the last 20 levels.)
---
I rerolled at 59 to prot / impale (17 / 3 / 31) , solo-ing is slower now but still very possible. Also fun when a rogue tries and gank you but you are full prot so can shrug off a lot. You will enjoy running dungeons more as a tank as prot imo, but it is still very possible to do it without putting any point in prot. Just be prepared to die a bit more and struggle to keep threat (especially in aoe situations). 
---
One last major help is getting an add-on like Neatplates, that show clearly which mobs are not attacking you.
---
Just cast an ability in combat. Just because it shows a ? the macro still works
---
I play healer as I find it equally enjoyable (at least) to DPSing in dungeons/raids and figured I'll have an easy and quick time when looking for dungeon groups - but no, sir.
---
Tanks are still in even higher demand (as it has always been), and they are often the last key to the puzzle when forming a group; generally hard to find. That's why I make a point of (be)friending all the good tanks I come across, they are worth holding on to. Same goes for any role, but double for tanks.
---
its a broad brush that's used here, there are 2 major areas that the hacked/levelling service originate from, them being Russia and China, that doesn't mean everyone from those areas are hacking or selling levelling service just that's where most are located. so when blizz system see a log in that is normally in the US suddenly log in from a Russian/Chinese IP address it will block the account and then a GM will investigate it and decide if to eave the ban on or overturn it, problem is it seem a lot of the GMs are just leaving it on and not listening to the the account owners when they say they have evidence to show it was actually them in that area and not a hacker
---
That doesn't mean that scamming someone isn't a shitty thing to do. It only means that it is more likely to happen.
---
Buying weed might be illegal, but if you get mugged and robbed while doing so, I would still classify the people who did that as pieces of shit.
---
You need the ability to ride for 20 gold and the mount itself for 80, so in total you have to spend 100 gold. If you are at least Honored with Thunder Bluff, you receive a 10% discount.
---
thank you
---
Bobby kotick needs more yachts
---
Depends on your MOS and if there is somewhat comparable AFSC. But even if there isn't you could probably still cross over and it wouldn't be damaging to your career longevity - after all, AF line side has had 100% promo rates to major the last cycle or two. The only real requirement for promo to major is that you don't fuck up egregiously and get a UIF or court-martialed.
---
Oh yea getting kited is the biggest issue vs a mage :(
---
They can use innervate on priest then use consumes (pot) for themselves. Use r1 starfire as last resort.
---
Out of curiosity, why? It seems like it's pretty obviously a joke.
---
I tried it, won’t work. If pressing once, I will just hold shield and fist. Guessing no way to switch both hands at exact time ?
---
I gotta ask since I’m pretty clueless on the matter. Is it hard for the devs to make say ~300 people fight on one screen without this horrible lag in this version of the game?
---
Thanks for your comment. I know I wrestle with putting the bare minimum lvl req but defaulted to the recommended level range because I felt it would guide people better. I sourced multiple websites for the ranges.
---
If you get enough dps gear and decent weapons you can dual wield quests as prot for 150 to 200 dps.
---
It sucks but questing is doable. Your farm is in dungeon/disenchant, fishing or selling your services though.
---
People are still starting to Play Classic. You will have plenty of People join your realm and you will have a headstart.
---
You will be fine :) Just wait till layering is removed and perfect
---
Sure, but just because you use a thing doesn’t mean you can’t criticize that thing.
---
cause youll basically never have so much rage that you can rend while also bloodthirst/mortal strike, whirlwind, and sweeping strikes/cleave/heroic strike and those are all way better to be doing
---
Thank you for explaining the context.  Sounds like the Minus 50 DKP would also make a great example.
---
Well you absolutey see a map of Northrend in Warcraft 3 a few times, in loading screens and such. Its a massive continent like it is in WoTLK, so I assume explorers would be able to tell that its well... a huge continent :P
---
What have they added to retail that makes tanking there harder? I only see things that have been changed to trivialize retail tanking—threat isn’t something you have to think about, everyone has an AoE rotation, etc.
---
The deadzone is where you can’t attack with ranged or melee, so having a good axe is irrelevant for that.
---
you don't downrank before you get lots of +healing
---
some people purposely set the initial bid really low so their items show first. Some of them then cancel the auction if it gets close to ending and the buyout hasn't sold.
---
I mean that might work.  Though many of the problems retail has are in late Wraith.
---
worse than just not having the numbers the GMs now are just random customer service people, its not like back in vanilla when the GMs were players that decided that working to help improve the game they loved was something they wanted to do. so whereas before a GM would have a lot more understanding now days its mostly just people doing a desk job reading off a script
---
Mograine is high pop and you dont see it there. There is a layer chat for that and people actually use it
---
Me? No, why?
---
It's crazy how the alliance's tween zone - Westfall - is so small compared to Horde's - "Barrens"
---
I know, I saw that too. I had work with the the original map though. I didn't build this from scratch. It has errors and such, just like Classic.
---
Thanks :)
---
I'd rather tell people like it is than sugarcoat it, it won't kill them.

I love my pet turtle but damn it fish and fruit can be hard to find sometimes.

Don't listen to farming Manual Crowd Pummeler.  Someone asking if a druid can tank doesn't need to go to that level of min/maxing.  
---
Yes druids are decent tanks.  Learn the mechanics of your class and you'll do just fine. You likely wont be Main Tank for 40mans too much, but can often be off tank and can tank any 5man ez pz.
---
Open with FF and spam claw into a finisher.  If the mob is -1 level or higher, use rip as the finisher.  If the mob is below that, use FB.
---
This can vary based on the mob, but I found the above to be the best case scenario for me leveling.  
---
I did the mob grind though, so I was usually in green quality gear.  You may be able to adjust a bit if you have blue quality gear.
---
You don’t need to spec prot unless you are tanking raids. I would stick with arms (or fury, if you like that better — whatever you are using to solo). 
---
The only thing I think is really mandatory is tactical mastery (the class feels really gimped without that since you can’t use 2/3 of your abilities at any given time).

I usually used to run 31/20/0 (which i think is by far the most common spec).
---
With that said, i think it’s fun and worthwhile to experiment with specs — try out a prot spec for a month or two if you want. try out 31/3/17. try out fury. try out 2H fury if you get an Unstoppable force. etc. You could try out fury/prot (3/31/17 or something — i hate it because it doesn’t have tactical mastery, but a lot of people apparently like it)... the respecs are a bit expensive, but the experience you gain is worth the cost.
---
Sounds like a boomer problem
---
Sorry miss understood the question. Thought the post was talking about how you couldn’t use range weapons at all under the 8yards and that was the pain.
---
So you want changes to hunter that address your listed issues..............they did, its called retail go play it.
---
Play as a Druid and you won't even care about mount :)
---
Baldboomer says 'Most people are tards'.
---
Well you sound like someone I would love to group with.  How about you change YOUR mentality.  When you join a group, say Hello, be upbeat and only say helpful things.
---
Groups go downhill when nobody speaks because everyone starts thinking the group members hate each other.  It doesn't take much to turn a silent group into a friendly group.  It's just a matter of being upbeat and friendly yourself.  People always value an upbeat and friendly teammate.  Nobody wants to group with a grouch who moans 'most people are tards'.
---
I have tested out my advice and all my best groups and valued friendships have been formed when I have been civil, friendly and upbeat.  Don't focus on others.  Just focus on yourself, your own attitude and what sort of person you want to come across as.

If I'm walking past you while you are in combat with a mob, I'll smack it once as I walk by.
---
What about all the sharks though
---
I play a paladin actually. Never could play a mage. But you just sound like someone with great comments to contribute. :)
---
not cleave and heroic strike its waste of rage.
---
I see what you're saying.  Thanks for finding that script for everyone.
---
Where is Durotar?
---
For leveling, any of the Stamina/Spirit Food.
---
Obviously check the combat log. 
---
However, my bet is you have an add-on or macro that allows you to heal by hovering over a person or there icon. 
---
This would cause you to heal that target even if you have a different target selected. I have done this several times when I dragged my mouse over the screen and the curser clipped a person while I was healing.
---
If you are not paying attention you can cast a few heals where it would look like your heals "missed".
---
naxx isn't hard finding 39 other people who can flawlessly do the safety dance on helgan the unclean or swap polarity on thaddius that however is asking the impossible. since at some point you will sit there having to Gkick or demote a perosn since they can't do the encounter and it is killing the raid and suddenly you are missing 4-6 raiders.
---
Naxx isn't hard it is unforgiving.
---
He literally responded to a guy who asked a question about who buys accounts these days....
---
I usualy charge / rend / MS + WW and look for OP procs
---
There is slam specc which is ok, not amazing. If you are Horde though 2H fury is viable with WF and spamming hamstring.
---
tab, sunder, tab, sunder, ...
---
Copper for a Pauper?
---
30 min cd that is shared with retaliation and shield wall
---
the ones i have seen have all be US/CAN players logging in from eastern Europe so it seems its more an an auto-mod banning due to ticking the boxes to a stolen account, you will find there are a lot of people travailing to other parts of the world that are not getting banned as they are not logging in from suspect country IP addresses
---
They can, but they are vulnerable to fear.
---
Still, paying even 200g for 10 armor and +2 defense when you've got a free mace in phase 2 (now announced to be later this year) seems like I'd just wait.  I have no need for a Warden Staff in phase 1, so I'll just wait for Phase 2 for the Dire Maul mace.
---
Dude it was not bots. 
---
You can modify and configure these addons so they they snipe faster than a regular sniper. 
---
Mine for example scans the last AH page EVERY SECOND, with a sound que of new auctions being posted, and combined with a buyout macro, yeah it might seem like a bot, but it's really not. 
---
1. You lost these items fair and square. 
---
2. It was your own fault. 
---
3. You wont get your items back.
---
4. No one is going to get banned or punished by Blizzard for this.
---
5. Please use the neutral AH more so we can earn more easy gold.
---
If it's not obvious to you by now, most of the no changes people seem to have meant no changes from pservers which they have nostalgia for lol.
---
OMG! Cow King's Hide
---
Waste of rage basically
---
I can buy you some for cheaper on Ally and post it on the neutral AH :P
---
Yes. STV and Badlands have tons of iron nodes.
---
I rolled Judgement Alliance and am really enjoying it (lvl 1-30 so far). Friendly community and a decent enough playerbase at peak times. I tend to find dungeon groups fast enough and dont feel like theres too many nor too few people in any zones I have quested in. Auctionhouse is busy enough, always tend to succeed in selling my items. 
---
Side note: all of this even considering I mostly play at unsociable times (11pm-2/3am) GMT
---
Players can go to retail and run AQ, Naxx, DM, and ZG **right now** - loot ignored, they're identical to the Vanilla versions. AB and WSG haven't changed.
---
So if this content is already available, if it's so well-known, why spend many, many years releasing it like players are chomping at the bit for something new? 
---
The full rollout for Classic, IMO, should be about a year. 2ish months between each phase. Naxx should be out this time next year. At that point, you have time to decide if you're going to Classic+, TBC Classic, or do nothing at all.
---
They chain CC you til honorless drops off then kill you.
---
Yes, bears are viable until raids. 
---
Unfortunately end-game is mostly about raiding &gt;_&gt;
---
while helpful you try getting a phone number for them now days, all their CS stuff is done through the ticket system, if you are lucky you can sometimes get some help off the regional CS on twitter
---
I use key bindings.  I have a Microsoft sculpt mouse with 2extra buttons.   I heal, so I have my main heals as 2,3,4, some shift keys, and my mouse buttons.  I like I’m not tied to some 10 button mouse with a specific number and configuration of buttons. I can use pretty much any mouse and still be effective.   I’ve healed like this since vanilla.
---
OmniCC and classicauradutations
---
That is the point of a guild
---
Ahh, I see your point, yea.  I can agree with that.  Lol woke up this morning and saw our conversation has been downvoted.  Why is that even a thing?  Do these troglodytes think we care if they downvote a silly conversation we're having?
---
You understand you can filter our flairs yes? I tagged it as art, and if something like this triggers your snowflake brain so hard that you have to respond like a sensitive little bitch, why don't you set your filters to never show art. Then you don't have to worry about "OmG tHiS iS r/WoW, wHaT tHe HeLl."
---
I thought they were awesome since they came from a girl with no knowledge of gaming at all. Who looked up world of Warcraft to understand why 60 was a big deal to me, and then hand craft these tops using chocolate to make the horde and alliance symbols.
---
She's not some nerd whose played the game since it's birth. That why this is so fucking cool, to me.
---
You are a miserable person. Your fiance is probably suffering from Stockholm syndrome to agree to marry such a lovely person such as yourself.
---
Welcome! To Zombo.com. yes, welcome. This is Zombo.com, welcome to Zombo.com. At Zombo.com you can do anything at all, the only limit is *yourself*.
---
I don't "need" 10 armor and +2 defense for close to 500g.  If you had a BiS epic item that was 500g that gave me 10% better defense/mitigation that scaled with every content patch in the future... sure, I would take that item.  This is not that type of item.
---
I seriously dont miss Herod at all.
---
Which transmutes?
---
Wait wait wait, did the priest ressing the rogue have a full set of devout or something? Is it POSSIBLE that a bug somehow triggered the automatic fear cast from the set bonus?
---
Dont let people tell you that arms is superior for leveling in any way. 2h fury does the same amount of damage due to enrage. And is superior to arms before 40 again due to enrage and access to 5% crit early. 
---
Dual wield works fine while leveling as well as long as your fighting mobs below your level, although its a little more inconsistent, sometimes you shred mobs sometimes you miss a lot.
---
j
---
There is a small range where you are out of range for melee attacks but still too close to shoot, making you unable to attack at all unless you move

That's why I said the attack speed only matters if you're specced deep BM, then it'll influence Frenzy uptime and a faster pet attack speed will give you higher dps. BM isn't a good endgame spec though so that won't apply to most level 60 hunters.
---
Because your entire post is weird. 
---
You cannot "ruin" your class. At worst you will kill mobs slower if you make a mistake with your spec, but it is not like you cannot get gold to respec eventually.
---
Also, I asked because of the added remark about not having friends.
---
You're missing the tirion fordring chain, gives bis neck or ring for a lot of classes.
---
Actually the decreased glancing blow damage reduction is far more important than the hit chance for your overall DPS. This is why you want weapon skill, not for the hit chance you can easily get from gear.
---
That is literally part of addiction, lack of or no concept of impulse control. If someone had a real issue with "wow addiction", just not paying the sub likely wouldn't cut it. They may even do something unfavorable to get the $15.
---
This was good! I'll happily watch and upvote anything or anyone that kills this guy.
---
I regret watching that, I had low expectations from someone with such a name.
---
TLDW, monitisation in current gaming is shit.
---
You can charge while in the nova? Amazing!
---
The name was cut and paste from somewhere else. Is this even Thassimar?
---
I'm having the same luck. At this point there's no way I'm running arena with a group that has another warrior, hunter, or enhance shaman
---
lol, that is awesome dude!
---
r/ThatHappened
---
Hillsbrad has been a warzone on netherwind since this started, its kinda great kinda a pain to get things done but all sorts of crazy.
---
Wago.io is your friend
---
Yeah we do that too.
---
I just meant I play solo. I read daggers are good for groups but swords for solo play. Sorry. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; Obviously, adjust this on environment,
---
I agree. But the question was how to not annoy his group and life tapping is something that can annoy healers and it's rather easy to do it in a non-annoying way.
---
As a healer I can't know if the random tank will lose aggro to the random warlock or if the random mage will pull aggro and freeze the mob next to the warlock. As I healer I always heal warlocks if I have the mana, it's just to many unknowns.
---
&gt; Unless the group plans for you to hellfire to AoE down packs. Either sac immediately, or once you start getting aggro from some mobs (to reduce pushback). It's a niche, but I just wanted to mention it for completion. Also, because it was my totem summon in Scarlet Monastery for that exact reason.
---
Is that efficient? Summoning daemon, eat/drink, AE, eat drink, summon new daemon, eat/drink, ...?
---
Y misstyped. Was really late
---
I dont think that idea works in wow as much. FF is such a more heavily story driven game than wow is. Its more about the characters  you met and relationships you establish with them. Your class having only minor changes on the out come (A healer asking for you help if you are also a healer).  In addition, a lot of the established lore for WoW certain races being certain classes really would clash with that. Undead who have little to no ties to nature as druids? Night elves who worship the moon/night becoming embodiments of light as paladins? While you just make it happen, you would mess with a lot of people by doing that.
---
Outside of complex PvE encounters, raids or PvP where you need the speed, it really doesn't make a notable difference at all.
---
I'm lvl 39 and thinking of dropping skinning. The time it takes to skin is not worth it tbh.. I'm just wondering what I should swap for..
---
I very much disagree. Outlands was made with the idea of facilitating flying mounts. There was SO MUCH EXPLORING and reward for just flying around random places, finding cool things, and doing quests on your mount.
---
Oh shit! I didn’t know that was a thing. How does one do that?!
---
Two questions one can anyone kill like thrall or anything like that. It says pvp boss but did not know.  
---
Also what is in the whirlpool on the map
---
Biggles here too. We are one of the more balanced servers but it is slowly slipping to horde as well. Consistent high/full pop. I wouldn't change this server
---
Aye.
---
&gt;Just be prepared to die a bit more and struggle to keep threat (especially in aoe situations). 
---
The last part about threat... that build you posted is the most threat oriented deep prot build there is. Maybe you were trying to say something else, but I would like to point that out nonetheless. I've tanked MC and ony with this. AoE threat is definitely an issue until you get trinkets, damage reflection ring and that gnomeregan helm + maybe a couple of consums, and even then you're by no means an AoE god. 
---
As someone who leveled with this build from lvl 1 (of course filling the fury and arms talents first) it's terrible for solo levelling. Absolutely aweful. Especially vs things that don't bleed. Level 50-60 were the most annoying by far with this build. I literally wouldn't want to spend 10 minutes outside of dungeons or without at least one partner. I really suggest to reroll into prot talents as close to 60 as possible.
---
Select the right icon manually instead of relying on #showtooltip to fix it for you. Only fix I've found.
---
Viewing time spent as  ' money gained per hour ' is absolutely ridiculous. Imagine I go trying to sell my playstation 1 memory cards for 500€, such a foreign way to think of things. 
---
Who expects any consistent payment from regularly playing a game?
---
&gt;Rebalance  
---
in short: No  
---
long: NNOOOOOOOO
---
I love when you roll up on someone barely making it through one mob while two more are smacking them and sending my pet in with Intimidation and a multishot/volley their way
---
I'll take it a step further and proclaim all pvp videos as lame unless there is something funny about it.  
---
It's like people posting pictures of their food on Facebook, to me.
---
IT'S IN MY BAGS BOYS!
---
Congrats!
---
What's your /played? 
---
Did you also do any professions?
---
Swords are better overall while leveling. There are "frontstab" builds but imho it is too much of a hassle.
---
Except voidwalkers are female.
---
rogues deserve everything they get, while smite and iron grenade aren't exactly the "I don't want to fight" spells either. even if he chose his targets wisely (if that, since it isn't obvious from the video) and popped a 30 min CD, he still managed to cut through 2 people like butter, and one of them was 10 levels higher to boot.
---
as much as I dislike warriors as a fellow troll priest, sub-60, they deserve every win they can grab.
---
I feel bad for the girl. Both blue &amp; brown were embarrassing.
---
HHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
You have some pretty good responses but I just wanted to add that I wish I knew I could have first aid and still keep my other two professions when I was leveling my warrior
---
I geed rolled on a Shadowfang when I first went through SFK with the classic relaunch. It sits in my bank waiting for the BG release.
---
So, I have this idea for a great movie. It's about two gnomes who find a bracelet of power, and they have to take it to the Burning Steppes and cast it into the Cauldron. They form the Brotherhood of the Bracelet. Along the way they're trailed by a murloc named Gottom, who's obsessed with the bracelet, and nine bracelet bogeymen. It could be a three-parter, called 'Ruler of the Bracelet'. The first part would be called 'The Brotherhood of the Bracelet', followed by 'A Couple of Towers', with the climactic ending called 'Hey, the King's Back!'
---
If you have a fishing pole you will never have trouble finding fish!
---
I don't debate over numbers but I do believe that the phases will be tied to the active playerbases progress, therefore asking it to be pushed forward is pointless. They see the exact progress the majority made and can decide what's the overall best decision. If it's 3months then 3 months if it's something else then that.
---
I do think however that the first phase should be long enough for the majority to reach lvl 60. 
---
Phase 2 feels tricky for me as the pvp rewards without the BGs will make the lvl 50-60 grind a pain with the bored lvl 60s around. I don't know if it would have been better to have pvp rewards from the start but it somewhat bothers me.
---
You called it "LACKED INITIATIVE" while its more that the other warr LACKED PATIENCE and decided to spend 500g on something that is possible to obtain for free.
---
Try tanking content that you're overleveled for:  ZF, Uldaman, SM, RFD.  Then, try and get a guildie or friend who is proficient at druid tanking to come with you and guide/coach/critique you.  Finally, make sure you're using swipe for multiple mobs if your group is going to AOE.  Otherwise, it's fine to just periodically do it, or do it more if you find you're losing aggro.
---
Exactly. Learning something new every day ;)
---
ICH HOFFE DU HAST EIN SCHÖNES WOCHENENDE
---
how is cleave a waste of rage if you have more than 1 target
---
That's not true, they said they wanted to get ph2 and DM out as quickly as possible and stages the rest of the releases based on the speed people cleared content -- BWL once the casual guilds have been completing MC, not to push ph4 or 5 if guilds are still working through BWL etc 
---
They never said ph1 would be the longest.
---
Horde are the overpopulated side, what makes you think questing would become impossible because Honour releases?
---
Besides, there's a level limit on who you can get honour from, and once you hit 54 you can simply do gear runs in dungeons and you'll hit 60 long before you have everything.
---
is this sub like free Asmon advertisement now?
---
This statement is true.
---
Why did this need to be a whole new thread instead of a comment?
---
Oh no, it is not 1/6 for Gorosh or the ogre. The shit bosses are more likely than the good bosses.
---
Bunch of sycophants following a Twitch personality that is acting and playing a part.  If you watch Asmon's videos when he was a nobody, that's the real guy.
---
This is good advice.
---
So you play the game a lot so you can spend less time... playing the game? *RKO dog headtilt*
---
Healers are the perfect escape goat for people that don't have a clue what is happening.
---
Same happens in retails I have been called a noob healers in mythic dungeon many times when I was 30% above what I usually need to heal. 
---
Don't be too bother by it, some people cannot accept their failure, healer is just an easy target.
---
But the feeling of pressure and accomplishment that come with the job is what makes me love healing, hang tight!
---
Silithis air/earth elementals?
---
Very little competition and hunters are great at quickly farming single mobs.
---
Is your loot window part of your overall UI or can it be downloaded a la carte?
---
Ya I looked at the title and was like... well that's a bit rude.
---
Then I saw their guild name.
---
My cat is literally lying/sleeping in my mouse hand and I don’t want to rouse him.
---
Pansy
---
To be honest i got tailoring to 300 (and robe of the void) at 57 and the only thing I framed was the satyrs for the demonic runes. You get plenty of cloth in instances with humanoids.
---
I've seen this work sometimes but not nearly all the time. /reload so far as been the simplest solution.
---
Could any of these be viable on a caster for... anything?
---
I love that dorf
---
You just need to upload the same file somewhere else, you can just make copies and new links to the copies. It's just so that 100k people aren't trying to download from the same source.
---
Ah didnt even consider silithus thank you!
---
This is the real answer
---
Who sayed it doesnt have a value? they sayed its nog EQUAL to gold. learn 2 read or atleast admit that youre a greedy person if you need on other peoples upgrades
---
I think it was the lfg tool myself. Once that came out nobody needed to socialize to complete dungeons and raids anymore. Hell, you didn't even need to fly out to the fucking instance anymore. Totally killed world pvp.
---
I see it more as a stipend than a business. 
---
But you could definitely use it to cover your daily expenses of repair and griffon flight while you are in a city doing Ah etc.
---
Repeating of course
---
bah, that would work for most but not all since some change the skill based on some conditions. Hopefully Blizzard is working on a fix. At least I have /reload until then.
---
Ok cool! Thanks!
---
You're trying too hard dude
---
It's really bothering me that I can't explain this.
---
I have Pre-Raid BiS, which leaves me at barely 3,000 HP and 4,000 Mana but sitting at 293 Spell Power. Every boss fight about 10-20% of my damage is Resisted, and I am struggling with Mana. I'm having trouble understanding how stacking all this Spell Power is beneficial when you OOM so fast? Yes, I'm using pots and runes and taps, but if I'm tapping I'm wasting GCDs I could be using for Shadowbolt, and when looking at logs of better Warlocks they tap maybe twice, if at all? Am I missing something?
---
The information on Icy Veins Warrior guide (written by me, with the close help of the fight club discord) is basically the same as what is written in the FAQs there but on a website format. You got fake news-ed!
---
Still recommend people to join the Discord regardless because its a great place to ask questions, but you will probably get raged at if you ask about things that are listed in the IV Guide / FAQs already :)
---
&gt;The marginal extra damage I take is offset by the fact the mobs die a lot quicker, and that I hold aggro a lot better so the healer doesn’t need to spread heals. If the healer is struggling with 2h, then I’ll switch to shield - but the difference is generally marginal with slower kills.
---
"marginal extra domage" is not whats go with my experience, expecially that its 90% of time 3-4 mobs pull to "best"use that damned ravager procs...  
---
   
---
if you take in cosideration that not to many ppls lvl up with healer talents and prabobly same goes with tank talents making it even more edgy by losing extra armor + block it may be similiar to me using agility/str gear for some extra dmg from AA + WF and f!@# mana pool, SP and mana regen :P
---
Essence transmutes are a 24 hour cooldown, arcanite transumte 48 hours. I don't know the metal ones but they basically never make meaningful money anyway.
---
Only reagents are the eseence it starts with or arcane crystal + thorium bar. You'll need a philosopher's stone but those are cheap to make.
---
In vanilla we had BWL less than 6 months into release and people didn't even have the game figured out then.
---
4 months to a phase is glacial.
---
 I don't really have the time to pour to higher ranks but pvp is one of the main appeals this game have for me and in thr end of the day I'm playing for fun.
---
It's quite common to flood the AH with inflated prices to influence things like Auctioneer trend data.  The goal might not be to sell them now, but instead later when the prices do inflate across the board.
---
I like to polymorph low health horde to heal them then pop it as I run away waving.
---
Should be viable to turn it into a business, less so without being able to use conjured food though
---
Cleave same as HS have hidden cost of rage. 
---
Lets say your AA generates 10 rage. 
---
Cleave cost 20 rage (i belive)  but it also consumes your next AA what would give you 10 Rage. so you lose 30 rage in total. Cleave is only good when ur rage is almost full, same goes for HS.
---
I would say depending on your class and what item you are buying on if it is a waste or not. 
---
For instance, I spent a good chunk of my mount gold buying Gut Ripper for my Rogue. To me, this purchase is a better quality of life adjustment than a mount at 40.
---
Still more entertaining than top level arena vids
---
What I don't get is this fake elitism, claiming that somehow keyboard turners are inferior.
---
You need to be able to do both well.
---
Sometimes you need to navigate with keyboard, while using mouse to manipulate camera.
---
Some times you need to steer with the mouse.
---
Sometimes it really doesn't matter, and you work with whatever is handy at the moment.
---
I have no idea, I've just seen it mentioned a few places.
---
What's your technique? Just rotate earth shock on mobs?
---
No, thank you! This is awesome, I'm looking forward to downloading the High Res version asap! You did great work!
---
meh... I value my time over money. If someone wants to throw a trade window up in Kargath I will probably oblige but I am generally completely ignoring random whispers unless I know the person in some form or another. I don't think it's crazy at all.
---
Thank god on my server this is no problem and everyone always greed which is the right way to do and even Blizzard thinks so.
---
Oh and I am Btw 60... I think we should stop the discussion. Against American neckbeard thoughts you can't win
---
The only reason why the honor system came long before BGs is because they were still in development.  That's not the case now.  Mirroring the exact timeline seems like a mistake.

It just means there's a lot of toxic people on twitch that can relate to him/his character.
---
It's halfway between looking cute and looking badass.
---
BY THE EMPEROR! THE DWARVES HAVE FALLEB TO CHAOS!
---
Mirah will give you higher DPS, but in a raid it should be better to use Bashguuder because the armor debuff boosts the whole raid's DPS even higher.
---
When you go too ham and end up ground beef
---
I had a shaman tank for an SFK run and it was one of the smoothest dungeon runs I've had in a while. As long as he hit shocks and got some rockbiter hits on mobs, we had no trouble with threat.
---
Yeah. For pve
---
You're stuck healing
---
Pvp you can ele and have some fun with it
---
Would you kill somebody to save 10 innocents?
---
Instantly starts to narc on the rogue lol
---
Multiple reddit accounts? With the comments I'm posting, do you really think I give a shit about my karma? 
---
Your insults are as lame as your cupcakes. Try harder little buddy.
---
Aye. But, people need to be careful about posting anything negative about streamers and YouTubers. One of the mods is a streamer/YouTuber and he will delete any negative posts against streamers or YouTubers.
---
13 days 12 hours. Did a bit of enchanting at the start but then left it, so I guess no.
---
Because you kill mobs before its end and in raids it takes a debuff slot IF the mob isnt immune to bleeding. A lot are.
---
In a similar vein, I noticed for the first time yesterday, that the big room with all the dragonkin trash in Sunken Temple has a big face in the roof, with sunlight coming through the mouth. I have been playing the since the european final beta :o
---
 not sure why blizzard had so much trouble with it. It's JUST an ogre with tiddies. it can't be too difficult to make a fat woman look appealing.
---
I do both
---
i've read your text 10 times.....  
---
im not sure what you are asking
---
Almost got me until I saw the /s...
---
No, the first phase will obviously be longer than the DM phase.
---
Get yourself some Free Action Potions on the Auction House. They're not too exspensive at least on my server
---
They are stupid. Tanks also get shit. The dps pull or just steal aggro constantly and then they ask you "are you even tanking?"
---
I know that feeling. It is ok. There are always goin to be jerks outthere.
---
Im a lvl 44 warrior. When I tnak I bring healing pots for me and some mana pots for my healer. I do fk thing up and I never blame the healer when that shit happens. The cool thing is, those pots I bring usually saves us a wipe and I always congratz the healer when the "path" or make up for a mistake I made. 
---
This usually leads to a good and smooth run and I love it. Find yourself better tanks and dont bother to join groups that only xare about aoe and xp per hour
---
I got the recipe!!! Nobody was here. Winterspring is a deadzone on my server
---
With how much you care deeply about Reddit and what's posted? Yeah I'm pretty sure you care deeply about your karma and Reddit is a majority of your life. Of that I'm quite convinced.
---
Later today. I dont care that the original comment is downvoted. Fuck the Arms Only circlejerk.
---
Even the nice kids stand out by the jarring things they say. i had this pally I was questing with in redridge last night. Nice guy, decent player, but man his comments were weird. When a quest item would drop he said "this quest is aids" and "thats straight ass". Its so crude and vulgar that it just..... seems to immature.
---
This is coming from a 31 year old who still remembers his teen years well.
---
Dont find em as entertaining anymore but kid me loved battleground commentaries, watching warriors get pocket healed and just sweeping strikes an entire graveyard to death was hype and made me get good at pvp lmao
---
That's pretty much my feeling as well... it still boggles my mind that he has a following.  15 year old edglords and 30 year old man children.
---
Who?
---
You'll have to look up the spell coefficient for Shadow Word Pain to find out how much of the bonus damage it gets.

How is adding Dire Maul and PVP stuff "rushing us through"?
---
BWL will be the first progression phase.
---
You're absolutely right about the concentration part, haha.  Part of the fun of Rejuv/Regrowth is that they let me run to the other room for an emergency Tootsie Pop if necessary!
---
I used to tank primarily and just need to get back in that mind-set rather than hanging back.  Also, I personally add every good tank I've had to a list and try to group with them again so you're absolutely right about the low supply/high demand.
---
Are there any specific addons you find that help?
---
No it's the searing gorge ! So cool :)
---
Deep prot just makes you harder to kill in pvp.  You want arms
---
&gt;Just get a fast Mainhand for tanking, and a slow mh for dps.
---
Huh. I thought it was the other way around
---
"Were the same level!" Because that *totally* means 5v1 is a fair fight, amirite?
---
The same thing when anything negative happens ever, get over it and move past it.
---
not alot.  few. In the raids yea but while leveling its definatly good. read my comment of origin questin
---
If that’s true, you have no reason to reserve anything then because you don’t need consumables for raids. As a prot warrior your primary resource of gold is dungeon farming. Also tanking as a paladin is not efficient enough or reliable to expect a group to want to give you any hand outs. You won’t be tanking raids, you drink after every pull with the dps, and your success is largely dependent  on how good your group is, and if they know what they are doing.  If you are a tank then you shouldn’t have a problem with other tanks reserving something, because there is only one per 5 man.  Otherwise leave prot warriors alone, trying to make some gold in dungeons, they don’t have many other farming options like every other spec other than holy priest.  Even prot palas can farm mis outside dungeons.
---
Idk, thats really the problem isnt it? People are more willing to blame their neighbor because its a neat simple solution. Humans are fearful and lazy.
---
Personally I'm still at 19, but that's because I only have time to play about 2-3 hours per week. I'm definitely on the low end of the curve.
---
You're cute.
---
My friends guild back in BC/WOTLK ran like a pirate crew and there would always be some kind of batshit event going on in their raids. Some nights theyd have roll gambling going the entire time, some nights everyone would agree to get as shitfaced as possible, even saw a most death competition. Their most consistent tradition though was kicking the resident scape goat at every opportunity, guy named chalupa. He got g-kicked like twice a raid on average.
---
Using it on my Orc Warrior myself, alongside Ras Frostwhisper's weapon (for dual-wield scenarios).
---
Its decidedly the best option before raid weapons!
---
I think he meant how many days of bread delivery do you get for 1g
---
If you can make them iceblock before popping a free action potion you generally win.
---
Sure, they can cold snap iceblock again, but you can also try to get out of range and charge them. If they're a good mage with a cancel macro built into their iceblock they might still win but if you can get clear and charge them after that you should have enough damage to drop them.
---
The issue is I don't have any free action potions as a leveling warrior and it really sucks.
---
You’re going to need to rely on consumables. Free Action potions give you 30 seconds of immunity to movement impairing effects, but don’t remove existing effects. Swift Action potions remove existing effects and give you 5 seconds of immunity.
---
There are also engineering items that can help a lot. Goblin/Gnomish rocket boots give you a movement burst, but you can’t change gear in combat (except weapon slots). Bombs, not dynamite, disorient the target for 3 seconds. Good if you get caught in a nova and they blink. 
---
There are also a lot of useful macros you should use to combine off-GCD abilities with GCD ones. For instance:
---
/cast Berserker Stance
---
(Add /cast Bloodrage here if you don’t have Tactical Mastery)
---
/cast Intercept
---
This will let you Intercept from any stance. You can also do this with Pummel or Shield Bash or Disarm... Any ability that requires a certain stance can be macroed into that same button press and won’t break if you’re already in that stance.
---
every server on PR control because they desperately need players on their no name server. It's kinda sad reminds me of /r/wowservers
---
you asked why cleave is waste of rage, nkt shod you rend when fighting pack of mobs. thays 2 diffrent things
---
I've never played a druid so I don't know
---
I don't even jerk with people here, but the first stream of wow I saw was his, I was like ''okay he has toons of viewers he must be cool''
---
He might be good enough at managing groups, idk, I start hating him very very quickly, he whines, he's rude, his personality wasn't interesting.
---
When he doesn't whine, he's ok.
---
WoW Petopia is a great resource
---
Imagine having an argument so weak you have to resort to calling people neckbeards
---
Would you say the same goes for druids? As they’re really fast, and thus perhaps even better in that aspect?
---
Ahah really i'm so confused...
---
Decently tuned for a solid roster, excuse my french. Pure hell for most. 
---
Guess We'll see I'm on memories, you were on Pserv. Both aren't classic.
---
"I haven't seen it so it's your fault!"
---
Gotta love Reddit sometimes. You're right op, blizz needs to beef up the servers, which they absolutely can, that's why they have cloud tech in the first place, so that wpvp and worldboss fights can roll out.
---
Sounds like he purchased the bread to me.
---
I hate to admit it but I haven't actually trained up Starfire and will need to do that!  I was thinking about respeccing for Insect Swarm for that debuff -2% hit and see if that would help?
---
Roll gnome + engineering. With bombs + frostreflector its very doable especially since 90% of mages in classic are clueless
---
You don’t. If you kill the mage they played really poorly
---
Definity pick the PvP one, 100% judging from your points.
---
The "questing will become impossible" thing is simply untrue, questing will never become impossible on any server. If anything, on a RPPVP server the situation is even better than on PvP servers because there are fewer gankers.
---
The queue times aren't a thing, I play on zandalar pvp myself (the EU rppvp server) and we never even have queues. If we did it's 5 minutes.
---
Come join us on the best server ;D
---
Omg, it's awesome. Thanks mate! ...now I will log to WoW to play another game.
---
You are welcome to your opinion, I just happen to disagree. Though i freely admit i could be wildly mistaken.
---
I just see it as a shallow but very wide market. It will always be there and in demand but you will satisfy that need in 10-15minutes, and while you could definitely keep spamming for 3hours straight i feel you would see drastic diminishing returns.
---
You could definitely also roll it into regular grinding - ie hit you macro while in epl, winterspring, silithus etc but keep grinding while ppl come to you.
---
This is my perspective in saying i see it as an easy constant stipend or supplemental income (or to use the modern parlance 'side hustle') but not a fully fleshed out and constant income stream that would denote a 'business'.
---
Alchemy transmutes. I left my question broad because I don't know enough to ask specific questions.
---
The fishing pole sitting unused in my inventory wanted me to thank you for saying that lol
---
Seriously though, I can't stand fishing, I know I just need to get over it to feed my pet more efficiently, but it is so boring.
---
Fake as fuck
---
Warhammer had a great pvp tanking set up. Taunting created a negative damage to everyone but the tank. So, people were encouraged to attack him. Also, body blocking was a thing.
---
I guess it depends how you interpret "RP Server". In every game I've ever played it's not a specific ruleset, it's a suggestion that if you like RP like minded players will gather here.
---
It's never been, at least in any game with a non-trivial population, a promise to enforce RP rules that are made up by the players.
---
This reply in your article seems on point with my feelings:
---
&gt;Ben Griggs (@braxwolf): Thinking back to my LOTRO days, I think the devs did a good job leaving themselves some “wiggle room” by naming the Landroval server as “RP encouraged” instead of straight-up designating it as an RP server. It was a place that typically attracted RPers, but if things went awry and elitist RPers (they do exist!) got upset about non-RP-like activity, the studio wasn’t under any obligation to take action based on preserving a perceived paid experience. I do believe that griefing needs to be policed, but if your definition of griefing includes non lore-friendly character names, maybe playing online with other people isn’t for you.
---
It bothers me that people feel the need to intervene in how others play the game. Yeah I agree someone calling themselves fishsticks isn't RP friendly, but I don't think you should get the right to police other players playstyle that rigidly.
---
Some hot pants.
---
It's a build where you go daggers for backstab and exploit the NPCs' hitbox to hit them with backstab even though you are in front of them.
---
You'll be a fine commander. If every CO had that mentality and didn't feel the need to try and micromanage operations then life would be much better for everyone. 
---
It's true at every level of leadership.
---
You just made my choice a bit more difficult. XD   
---
Where do you play?
---
Nice, that's a lot of time. Hope you don't get bored! :)
---
Priest needed corpse maker but you won?
---
OP this is amazing!
---
I love you
---
Leveling as a healer class seems to be the same. The amounts of "Hey can you heal *Insert dungeon here*" is insane.
---
It's a trash epic. I have one too and kept an eye on the price. Generally fluctuates between 10-15g on my server. If I could get 40g for it I would sell it in a heartbeat.
---
Sure. Instructional videos that actually teach pvp tips, rather than just using that as thinly veiled opportunity for more showing off, are good too.
---
Oh yeah questing I usually opened Charge into Rend Auto Attack macro. Not using the Hamstring method.
---
Sometimes I think the people who hate asmongold are more obsessed with him than his fanboys are.
---
Full rank ES on maintarget, start melee on offtarget with Rockbiter. Switch melee to maintarget after 1 or 2 hits, ES r1 on CD on maintarget.
---
That was pretty much more than enough to keep threat, lighting shield on 3 mobs and tab melee. If anyone pulled aggro max rank ES was a basically a taunt, the mage could use Blizzard and the Hunter multishot without problems.
---
4-5 Mobs I would open up with Lighting bolt on X, ES on Skull, melee on 3rd target and then switch melee on other mobs while ESing maintarget.
---
It's not a business deal, you agreed upon a set amount, it's time to pay up. You seek advice but argue vs the advice given to you, pony up and send the man his gold or return the item. I thought I read it's been sitting since Sat so 6 days in your mail. You're just screwing the person now.
---
Mate it’s driving me insane lol. All my friends are 50+ and I’m stuck on choosing a class. Today will be the day I decide! Or... will I?
---
Cleave and heroic strikes are rage dumps
---
You know, I totally have that recipe too and have made a couple - only I didn't realize they actually do damage, that is awesome.  I do try to eat some Sagefish dishes while healing for the mp/5 so that's a great idea :)
---
I am alli. So you would say that It is not optimal but It is viable? My dmg will be decent, right? I'm not even looking to be top dps, just useful.
---
I wish people wouldn't expect me to keep threat on 7 mobs in UBRS when they ninja sheep pull then charge in and start AoE-ing.
---
Gquit that guild
---
Basically I’m going to pve and pvp for sure. Question is deep prot build to main tank pve and tank pvp or arms build for pvp and off tank for pve
---
I give out healthstones to every player I see sitting down drinking/eating, and soul stone random people when I known I won't be needing one for a while.
---
“Not sure if it was out of fear or pure embarrassment”
---
Or maybe the group was just taking too long to form? Or they had to go? You sound a bit ridiculous with that statement.
---
I'm pretty new. Played in wotlk to level 60ish hadn't played before that or since. I dinged 40 2 weeks ago and had the mount money when I dinged. I'm playing rogue if that matters. Having 90g at lvl 40 isnt that hard...
---
There is some good advice in these answers.  I think patheticdoormatdude's answer is really all you need, but this is also where a guild should be a powerful resource to you.  They should be able to help point out anything you're doing that might be wrong or potentially lethal (pulling groups the tank is pulling) etc.  
---
If a guild isn't willing to help you find those answers they probably aren't a good guild.
---
See: Sap
---
No that costs too much to respec. Sell your services tanking dungeons that you dont need gear from. Also you can tank literally all dungeons as dps spec, the content is that easy. Hell you dont even need to be prot to tank MC.
---
What's manly about killing people that pose no challenge?
---
HHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
as a healer I have looked into the tribute chest loot table and couldn´t find anything. However I need two drops from the guards. Tribute run groups may find it diffucult to find a heal.
---
Laptop couch player here. What mouse are you referring to? I only play for pvp with a mouse the rest of the time it’s just laptop with no mouse.
---
Every class can use magic.
---
Except warriors and warriors are the Brute force fighters. 
---
Hunters train animals and shoot bows and were literally a last minute addition to wow. 
---
How does a person with a circus tamed pet fit in the same world as magic and world class fighters?
---
I need to make a macro! "No I do not want to give you bread/water"
---
Activision Blizzard doesn't care.
---
Ok so when Is it expected to use thorium bullets or arrows?
---
Honestly it was my number 1 assignment so I’m stoked.
---
he didn't really though, a GM just moved his corpse to the spirit healer
---
Deep Wounds as a passive effect  is lower priority and won't overwrite an actively applied debuff.
---
It's less about the loot and more the principle.Yeah, I don't need that 10 silver and random shit from the chest, but I'll sure as hell be pissed if a rogue (or tank in my case) believes it's all for them. The dungeon is done as a group, so the loot is split as a group
---
How hard is to tank them ?
---
&gt; buffing an ally will generate threat, but that threat is split evenly by all mobs involved
---
That is not the case. It was a few weeks ago, but that was a bug with battleshout and some healing-spells and is fixed by now.
---
If layers were not a problem, then how come Blizz broke the /who function????
---
No one here actually gave you the correct answer wow. Well here it comes, back in the day at lan parties where monitors and computers were huge and big desks were not yet a thing people playing counterstrike, dota, WC, Starcraft, they wanted as much 'mouse space' as possible (especially for CS where you set your dpi lower for more accuracy and the lower it is the more you have to physically move the mouse to turn or aim in game) so they would turn their keyboard sideways. I assume some people got used to it that way (older gamers) and the few newer gamers that still do it learnt it from thier dad or uncle or older brother I guess and just kept doing it that way.
---
So this warranted a comment? Lol your life must suck.
---
Sorry I'm a bear.
---
lol that's hilarious
---
Yea :) but it’s a fair trade, I tank dungeons for the guild and help them get raid ready and can’t farm very well and in exchange I get some gold for raid expenses.
---
Holy fuck that is some powerful stuff.
---
Your friend is an idiot. It costs money to make a portal.
---
ResidentSleeper on your comment bruh relax
---
Very skill and consumable  dependant, and assuming semi fair pvp thus is sort of a rough guide on the classes
---
 Mages fare well against melee, except feral druids. And less so against casters (although they aren't unfavored by much) 
---
Warrior generally doesn't do well against anything, except rogues, but even then it's not guaranteed
---
Rogues have a fighting chance against most classes and specs, if they have cooldowns they can do some pretty nasty stuff, avoid paladin  you cannot kill them
---
Warlock is pretty much THE 1v1 class as soul link but it's a bad spec for raids or group pvp.
---
shadow priest is similar to warlock, but without the need to change pets based on class, very prone to running out of mana though, and as such very vulnerable to hunters who abuse their superior range
---
Hunters are very encounter and phase based, BM is insane at lower gear levels and destroys casters, but once they get raid gear they can counter if they can close the gap and stay in dead zone, very skillbased and has a solid chance against most everything, nothing but a druid is capable of escaping a hunter 
---
Ele shaman becomes a nightmare in aq gear but similar to spriest very mana hungry and much more gear dependant. enhance is sort of a casino spec, might win or lose based on rng, but aren't generally favored, no escape options and limited chase potential.
---
Paladin is similar to warrior, generally a group PvP spec as holy, ret is decent at 1v1s
---
Voidwalkers are all female.
---
So it would She goes home to her wife, and their daughters.
---
Is the /hug tip a troll or is it legit?  Hit 60 and not looking forward to spamming sinister strike/fighting 10 other rogues for swords in raids.  Not that daggers has a particularly higher skillset, but at least it's more of the archetype "rogue" gameplay, and is a lot more fun in PvP.
---
"Pulling and LoSing them," me
---
*stands in middle of road and immediately pops all cds and aoe*: healers and dps

I’m leaning towards Judgement. I checked /who at 11pm and there was between 15-30 people in each 10 interval bracket which suited me. This was on alliance. How is horde on judgement and does the Judgement realm have a community discord?
---
Thanks! Level 24 now, so still alot to go!
---
I wonder.. is it a good or bad thing?
---
Maybe they're both sexy females. Or sexy males. Or just plain ugly as sin but meet and fall in love .

It scales with your attack power and stats so the number is more. In addition it’s passive damage not relying on swings or additional rage.

but isnt it limited within time how long u can do chargeback on paypal etc? like could u do it a year or more after if thats what u wanted?.. i mean most ppl if they sell their accounts its because they leave so it would be a fair amount of time before the account would be reclaimed unless the person do it only to scam... one i played arenas with sold hes account to a kid who payed loads cus it had multiple glad and hero titels and abit over a year after he came back and just reclaimed the account.. i always felt sorry for the kid
---
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I just needed people to tell me so
---
If you're horde, do the shellfish farming in desolace. It's 8-10g an hour. Use underwater breathing potions. 
---
As far as addons, those are highly personal choices. I use a ton, but that's just me. I personally always go with Recount (Damage/healing/etc meters), Bagnon (concatenates all of your bags into one bag), Bankstack (one click bag sorting, although it seems to freak out about my ammo/quiver often), and Questie (quest helper). I also like using a swing timer so I know when in my rotation I can use Aimed Shot or when I can move. Bartender gives you more UI flexibility. Vendor Price and Wide Quest Log are also really nice in Classic. Play with them and find ones you like.   
---
I use the Twitch app. You can manually download and manage your addons through a site like CurseForge but I find it much easier to let Twitch do it all. One click updating makes your life much easier.
---
I tanked everything except eranikus with 2h just fine while doing ST runs. BRD starts getting big packs where you really need the extra armor and block chance though, I stopped 2hing there. Up until BRD though I 2h tanked everything just fine. This isn't a problem with using a 2hander to tank, this is just a problem of bad/inexperienced tanks.
---
Night elf. No real type preference.

On my warlock, I have given a Lesser Magic Wand and a Greater Magic wand to a level 10 priest who didn't have a wand and was consistently out of mana.

when do you start learning the fish recipes or do you need to find them at a specific trainer? i'm very low but fishing for cooking lvls is def on my list to get at least to 60 for thistle

Did you roll horde or alliance on Judgement? I would probably go for Alliance as I’ve already rolled horde through to 52.

Why is it fine to post "look we killed onyxia!" but not, "Look I killed 2 players"?

I do both. 
---
Being on a PvP server, I tend to swivel my camera view *a lot.* Sometimes I need to be running one way and turning with my keyboard while keeping the camera focused on what's behind me.
---
I might get downvoted for that but... any plans for a paid class change? I love the leveling and I've been enjoying it thoroughly, but I have done it several times on pservers + classic and it is just now (at level 50) that I realize that my class is overpopulated AF. Way too many people rolled priest and shadow priest. I want to be able to enjoy the endgame content (never tried it). 
---
Even though I love the leveling experience, I've had enough at this point. I don't want to run cleave groups either to level faster, sounds extremely boring and cheap.
---
Anyone that tries to deny that Mages are overtuned in classic is delusional. 
---
Almost the best DPS in PVE, Pretty high up in PVP, one of the best farming class, tones of utility which can also be used to make money (Portals and cheaper drinks/food)
---
What exactly is the downside of a Mage again? Oh right, you will have to roll against all the other mages when it gets down to gear.
---
I would like to sincerely say "fuck those guys". They represent the toxic side of the community that any normal person should avoid unless they are actively looking for that style of play. Anything with "spellcleave" or "meleecleave" in the title is a big red flag.
---
Please, don't let it put you off, a small percentage of douches with toxic attitudes should not govern your fun.
---
Please go back, play with awesome people and try to avoid trash like those guys.
---
Same thing with bwl/aq/naxx etc.
---
Go make your own guild with Cocaine and hookers.
---
I get like 10 whispers a day from randoms asking me to heal/tank something.
---
Same! I used to have soooooo many chars across so many realms. My friends group was notorious for rerolling. By the time I hit 60 on my first one, TBC was announced shortly after which made it all feel pointless. I missed out on a ton of raids cause of but this time it's different! Am 60, running MC and ready for what comes next! :D
---
Apologies for the confusion, i was mainly referring to your qualifier of "lucrative" business, but instead didnt make that sufficiently clear and got lost in the weeds a bit in regards to terms.
---
The main issue with your potential plan is that you cant mail conjured items, which is why i was saying it'd work better as an occ used macro when you are in an area convenient for multiple transactions.

Fishing is the reason I have 60g at level 29!

He edited his post from “5 of those.” To “5 of those hours.”

I was making a joke.
---
Some people are rend/hamstring kiting. I don't like it, because I've had no success with it; I've had mobs hit me with melee from 40 yards away and dismount me. Melee leeway is kinda sucky.
---
I thought this too; 10 years ago I keyboard turned with the best of them, never thought anything of it. This time around, sometime in the 30s, I unbound my turning keys and replaced them as strafe keys, and oh man did it make a huge difference after the initial adjustment period. I honestly don't know how I played so long without having done this, it makes navigation and PvP movement way easier. I have only found one downside: be careful with your right clicks in neutral cities.
---
It's like watching a movie on opening night in a theater with a hyped crowd vs watching it home alone. We like to feed of each other, and check each other for cues on how we should be reacting to something. Having someone to share emotions with makes it 'funner'.

"Nobody cares to see an apology after 4 pages of bullshit"

"I agree it is mature to circle back and admit it was wrong"

Seems conflicting.

Meh, pop a FAP and don't stand in it

I do this of they ask nicely. So many people just walk up and open trade demanding food/water or want portals for free.
---
looks like you could rly benefit from teaming up with a hunter to take care of the strays so you don't waste so much time kiting and can focus on nuking
---
What about EU realms
---
In corporate life, the big struggle can be finding a manager who accepts that they don't know better than their specialist subordinates and to trust their professional opinion.

I played back before BG's were ever a thing. World PvP can be awesome and it's one of the biggest things I'm looking forward to.
---
I only healed one so far in RFK but he would charge-&gt;ss-&gt;def stance and pulled at a reasonable pace
---
For context, they were the last ones to join and 2 of us were already waiting at the instance. I can't remember the exact conversations but they were definitely up for the run until they perhaps noticed there wasn't a warrior or druid tank.
---
Sure I added a bit of salt for comedic effect but it's just ridiculous how many warriors don't want to "tank". You don't even need to wear a shield, just go gung-ho with your 2H and enjoy the extra rage you're getting.
---
For sure. I killed Ironspine (I think was his name?) and got that 1h mace drop. That thing is great for tanking at that level
---
Awesome
---
I thought you were playing a Warlock!  🤔

The reason I would tell them to gquit is that

---
I'll be fairly confident a portion of a 40 man that's just started MC never bothered. If anything, the memes about steamrolling classic endgame has meant half the game's players can't be bothered farming consumables and see enchants as "I'll spend the $$ after I get the tier 1 gear". You're spot on regarding Ragnaros and I've seen plenty of players say things like "why bother with FR gear when he's so easy now".
---
If this tank has gone to all that effort, they deserve better.
---
The best quest text is mother milk cause you literally ask the npc to milk you.
---
&gt; When should I expect to feel the class is fun to know if I should continue play it?
---
Since classic release, I've only been playing Warrior. Personally, the class started to work itself better when I got Execute, so around lv 26 or 28. And even more so when I finally got my WW axe!
---
Warrior is really fast to level, this idea that you have to stop and drink after everymob is a huge falacy, truth is you can keep killing mobs of your level or higher in quick sucession, and just throw a bandage every 3 mobs , less if you're lucky with crits and kill stuff even faster
---
The only posts that are allowed is when people do /bow towards each other before the fight? I find this post so much more enjoyable than "Look I got a drop!" or "Look I killed a NPC!".

What server?
---
Look at how much effort you put into your responses tho. In before “it didn’t take that much effort”
---
What an angry nerd
---
Was the same in Star Wars mmo, absolutely loved the idea. Enemies affected by taunt were doing 30% less dmg to other players except the one taunting.
---
I'm mostly here for Thunderfury and BGs.  I see myself spamming BGs to Rank 11 then quitting tbh
---
I had to roll Dwarf after I saw that females do a roundhouse jumping kick for the kick animation.   
---
I will actually stand to see the full animation play out just so I can feel the sheer lack of respect for spell casting.
---
In classic, you can also drown while dead.
---
SW:P gains 100% of spell damage, so 488 base damage + 14 spell damage = 502 damage
---
I have been analyzing this phenomenon and talking with other people about it for a while now, because the hate is for the most part directed at **both** Icy Veins and Wowhead, no matter what is actually being written or by whom. Imho, it is down to **three major factors**:
---
1. The Classic guide "scene" has way, way higher competition than Retail's (where Icy Veins and Wowhead dominate for quite a few years now). The people responsible for these competitor websites are simply willing (and can afford) to be quite more aggressive in their promoting strategies.
---
2. There are a lot of people like you, who played WoW long ago only to quit and restart now, playing WoW Classic. Because the guide writing at these big websites has been spotty in the past (mostly **before Legion**, which is when both websites started mass recruiting so that guides can be properly split and written by people playing the class rather than whoever was available), that was the experience of these people, and they haven't taken the time to go back and see if things have (vastly) improved since then. Back in those times you could write feedback on the forum and be ignored. Nowadays you need to reply / fix your stuff if warranted within a couple of days or you are in trouble with the admin teams and up for replacement.
---
3. WoW Classic is a very **open** game in respects to talents and play styles. There is not a single way to play, as it usually the case on retail. Thus, a guide will mostly be listing / explaining **one of the ways to play**, which the writer prefers. But there are different guides out there with equally viable, if different, ways to do things. That does not mean that either of them is necessarily wrong (outside of the occasional typos / mistakes with how stats work, and such), but many people who are partial to a specific way to play the game will see any deviation from their style as "guide is shit / wrong". That is the wrong, very much "BfA", way to look at things in WoW Classic.
---
\+1 for classicauradurations. It's very simple.
---
No problem my guy
---
Not for a long while. From 50 onward it's totally fine. But the Arms power spike arguably lasts a while longer than that until you start putting together a good set of gear.
---
Melee cleave is a more advanced type of play.  A newer player shouldn't be expected to keep up.
---
Aside from the group being dicks, just knowing what a melee cleave group is for next time helps.  It's a fast paced run, where healer needs to position to drink with 0% downtime if not drinking.  You don't even have time to scratch your own nose.  
---
As you play more, you will find useful add-ons and macros that make healing more efficient and easier.  
---
Don't worry about it and enjoy the game.  There's a percentage of dick in everything.
---
It was great and bad at the same time. I loved that you could pvp to level as well, although it was slower than questing.
---
&gt; The main issue with your potential plan is that you cant mail conjured items 
---
Yeah, I figured that out. I believe I added that as a disclaimer throughout, too, that it impacts the viability. The alternative would rather be to mail cooked or scavenged items, rather than to sell regular conjured foods. 
---
It's more about the business model than about the profit margin, so to speak. Selling conjured foods solo is nothing new, creating a food subscription system is (or at least I choose to believe it is)
---
White and horde here.
---
I run with 5 people in discord and questing in STV is hilarious. We chase down lvl 40s and 50s and , well, anyone who gets in our way we will try and take on.
---
We are all level 32-34.
---
Nobody ever expects a well practiced 5man to blow all cooldowns, potions, coordinate stubs and interrupts out of seemly nowhere.
---
So. Much. Fun.
---
They accomplish the same thing -&gt; allowing you to use a bunch of abilities without clicking on them.
---
IMO, it really doesn't make much of a difference, since most classes only use 3-4 abilities over and over, and you can get away with clicking on the occasions you need the others.
---
Not that there was a choice, but my point was that the EST servers are physically located in CST so much better ms than expected.
---
That's batshit insane. I mean, the math checks out, but in reality this is so far away from reality it's amazing.
---
Those bullet points also serve as a great question prompt. 
---
‘So what is a “raid leader”?’
---
Which gives you the perfect opportunity to show how you have people management, organizational, and time management skills. 
---
Plus if the interviewer has a stigma against me playing video games they’re not somebody I want to work for anyways. 
---
The catch is when I was younger and more replaceable I’d hesitate to add stuff like that to my resume because I *needed* a job. Now I don’t have the space.
---
Any reliable infos on that?
---
Devout is a shield not a fear, right ?
---
Looking back, I wasn't clear about it in this thread, so that's on me, but regarding "you cant use conjured \[bread\]", I meant it as "you can't use conjrued bread for the purpose of a mail order system"
---
more so not under appreciated, you get treasure and stoneform - which is sick
---
That was a month ago. I believe he could get a second character to 40 in that time frame.
---
Because it's true
---
Nope gotta unlearn it just like with Blacksmithings   armorsmith/weaponsmith
---
Druid healer is a beast in Battlegrounds such as AV. I used to top healing consistently.  Instant cast spells are great and if they try to gank you, shift to bear form, target someone that's away from the battle, charge the heal up. I used to heal in MC just fine, but obviously priests are superior for healing. Good thing about druid is you can dps and tank if you get bored. I had a lot of fun on my druid back in the day.
---
its a pvp server get over it
---
Pretty sure /who has a limit of 50 results...
---
I Thought Shockadin wasn't really a viable thing before TBC, and it was in Cataclysm it was actually viable.
---
I’ll be 60 by then lol
---
Ehh it's less about what they're tanking with and more about how they're tanking. 
---
If it's a warrior who is playing the role of tank, while using a 2h weapon, I have no issues. They maintain threat and tank mobs. If anything it makes healing more entertaining since they're taking more damage than if the had a shield equipped. 
---
If it's a dps warrior who is advertising themselves as a tank meanwhile all they're doing is dpsing, and not really giving a fuck about aggro on dps / healer, then there's an issue. Unfortunately about 2/3 of the "2h tanks" I've come across have been in the latter category
---
Well, as you said you're NE so you don't get any weapon skill which means you need to get to 9% hit, which is pretty much your number one priority. However, most people opt to get their hit from less important item slots than the weapon, at least for pre-bis.
---
Herod. 25% of the world population seems to be shadow priests, and mainly because they switched after they realized there were too many priests.
---
Just jumping onto the ledge, not even out will trigger
---
Unfortunately that will never be a thing
---
These are the hero's we need and deserve !
---
Furious howl on it?
---
Most of the community have been guessing P2 would be 3 months after launch give or take. That puts it late November. Give or take a bit of delay, that lines up with what that dev is suggesting.
---
now go look the prices for retail accounts with rank1 Glad titels and rare mounts or trasmorgs on it and come back... lol... ive been thinking about selling my account for quite a while because of the prices but i know i would regret it if i where to play again some day or my son would want to play those games so im still holding on for now
---
There isnt really much "tanking" going on if you're doing 3 mage+priest farming. Your job is to gather mobs with initial threat, then get out of the way once mages start nova'ing. You taunt stragglers and get them off of your casters. But if you're dying or the mobs are all spread out the DPS is messing up, there are a lot of inexperienced mages that spam blizzard and dont keep their nova/coc rotation up.
---
Yeah but then whos pot do I stir with my stick?
---
That's not what I'm talking about though, I'm just talking about running LFR over and over with 22 saved people and 3 un-saved people, nothing else.
---
Zombie camel?
---
....are you kidding? lol
---
The point is it’s confirming phase 2 will begin before the end of this year.
---
They don't need bread when they are a bunch of cannibals.
---
If I’d role a warrior and we were waiting for a tank any self respecting warrior would slap on the ol board and sword and get to work. If you don’t then you clearly don’t live in the classic mindset.
---
That's not "keyboard turning". In this context, keyboard turning means using the turn keys instead of holding right click to turn. The speed difference between the two is astonishing. What you are referring to is still super common in FPS games, and I believe for the reasons you have outlined above.
---
There's no way to get reliable info on these items yet, without more people using wowhead addon to collect data.
---
It's already 0.5% on wowhead but, it's not a large enough data set to be reliable. 
---
Best data I can give you is a anecdotal evidence.  
---
I play on firemaw, and I've seen 3 alliance and 1 horde with it. Considering the fact that people activly farm emp for various reasons and the lvl 60 population on the server, it should be a much higher number of IF owners than 4.
---
“Reddit I don’t know how to interact with human beings and make decisions, give karma pleaaaaaaase”
---
Just use one and it shows them again... works every time.
---
Check your CPU and GPU temps. WoW stuttered for me last year and I did everything possible. Turned out it was my CPU over heating. I installed a liquid cooling set and was good to go.
---
Why drop them before you hit 60? All you really need to craft in phase 1 with tailoring is robes of the void.
---
Congrats! I'll be there in a couple weeks hopefully
---
Also there are people like me building a PvP character and a PvE character. This gives me time to get 2 60s
---
Yeah but Fury is more fun
---
There's a similar guild on Azuresong called "Wipes on Trash." We consider them our sister guild, since we're "Slightly Below Average."
---
Based on the fact we usually have 30ish people on at any time, but still don't have a tabard design, we might be more than slightly...
---
You're also kinda paying for the security of knowing that your character and hard work won't get wiped out in a few months by a DMCA.
---
Oof! 
---
I'm sorry if you can't find the humor in this. You may want to become a bit more introspective though, because this feels heavily projected, my bud.
---
You must now kill boars in the wild until you can afford your mount.
---
Getting a fast weapon only really becomes something you look for when you start getting rage capped so you can dump it faster with HS. That doesn't really happen in MC/Ony.
---
Thassimar, true hero of the horde! Lok'tar ogar!
---
Voidwalkers basically step into work and the first thing they say is "I don't like this place."
---
I can relate.
---
Neutral AH cut should be 30% for classic.
---
the staff from ZF is really good for warlocks.  10 int 10 stam 21 spell damage required level 42.
---
Stats &gt; everything else. Speed is nice but not necessary. Early on when stats are rare on ranged, I buy throwing weapons (saves a slot in my inventory too) due to their speed.
---
You have so much shit on your action bars I bet you dont use like 60% of whats there.
---
Oh No! Had to leave Orgrimmar and kill one boar!
---
Runecloth, sure!
---
OOF
---
Two-hand weapon Fury builds. Needs a slow weapon, as you are giving up some time on your auto-swing to get some more attacks in with a faster slam. Uses rage, so you need to have plenty of rage left to bloodthirst / whirlwind on cooldown or it would have been better to not use slam to begin with.
---
All of these factors combined mean that you should use it on **Horde side**, with **Windfury Totem** (for +rage and slam has a chance to proc it aswell) and with a **Slow Two-Hander**. Best of luck! :)
---
*x-files theme*
---
You and everyone is saving up items for twinking. When bgs come the market will be floodee for months. Do you want to hold onto that robe for 6 months or more?
---
Hunters use magic. They can resurrect dead animals.
---
Yeah, it's pretty insane... that's close to the schedule I had for a couple of years when I was in the military. IIRC, my first character had 1 year of /played time in about 2 years of real world time. (Some of that might be AFK, but not very much.)
---
We already knew that.
---
Yeah no problem, this macro isnt going to work. The first 2 lines work because battle stance and mocking blow on are separate GCs so they can realistically happen at the exact same time. The third line cannot happen because you're global locked. You'll have to swap back top defense stance manually. 
---
This is what I do for stances. I use my two mouse buttons one is bound solely to defense stance, and the other one is bound to my stance swapping macro.
---
Logically you would have to say Yes its okay. 
---
There is literally no way to not say yes. 
---
Its an Rp server and the buff says “You have been replaced with your evil twin”
---
Wasn't worried whether or not people charge or have a regent associated with it.
---
Was just stating his issue and being a hunter are sometimes one in the same.
---
Gz now switch that 2h and go holy.
---
Go to Steamwheedle Port. There's a house slightly north of there with a book on the table called "Soothsaying for Dummies".
---
Though.. With Engineering, it's always better to go from Gnomish to Goblin. Almost all Gnomish items are equipment, while Goblins use the consumable Goblin Sapper Charge.
---
I mean, if you spend a few minutes talking shit like that for something *that doesn't actually matter* and you don't get your ass beat, I'd be surprised. It's good the dude apologized. Not going to give a wanker like that a pat on the back for it though.
---
This is epic. Thanks!
---
Polymorph people who just landed, kill once it pops. Ezpz.
---
Mograine pretty 50/50 populated nice community :)
---
&gt; why is everyone focused on getting a mount at lvl 40 asap?
---
 
---
&gt; it makes your traveling faster, which will speed your leveling up, ~~maybe even~~ a lot
---
You answered it. But if you wanna buy gear instead, you do you. Level slower if you want.
---
Exactly! It blows my mind how oftern people dismiss tactical Mastery. Stance dance is the basic of every warrior play
---
Add  #showtooltip   ?
---
The post I linked said that most servers (i.e. not the high pop ones) were low single digit.
---
As a rage dump IF you are running a very slow 2H and are near rage cap. Make sure you have a swing timer and use it immediately after an ordinary attack.
---
they invented games like candy crush for your kind  ^^
---
Look at the raid frame, he was dead and got ressed with PS up
---
Oh he meant camera turning using awsd or arrow keys in wow vs mouse. Lmao
---
Exactly, that's a pitty for newcommers not aware of the possibility to turn around with mouse.
---
I had yesterday a mage and a priest backpeddling and keyboard tuning every goddamn time. Guess which group failed to kill the Maraudon's Princess. God, they were so awful.
---
WoW is a 16 years old game and I'm astonished to see so many players being absolute garbage at the game.
---
I agree, 90g is not impossible, but he had 211g at 40, which would be insane for a “new” player. All I’m saying is I questioned what OP meant by “new”, which really isn’t a big deal anyway
---
This fool thinking a non maxed toon with 150g is worth $400 lol
---
There is never a situation were keyboard turning is useful.
---
There was a bug in the first two weeks of classic where ANY crit from ANY Melee hit did 0 dmg to the priests shield.
---
Its fixed since around two weeks now.
---
 nice twist you did there: you see the ones who intervene in other players playstyle as the rope players who police those that intervened in their playstyle at first.
---
there's not much to do to all fit together with our different playstyle: not using /say and /yell for Out Of Character communication, that leaves ALL the other channels for whatever you want to speak about. or just adding a few more letter in an announce liek writing "selling" instead of WTS (+4 letters) to avoid acronyms in yell. and for the name one can be named as he wants as long as his name doesn't pop in /say or /yell or in /emote. exemple: your alt is banksomething and it's not a problem as long as banksomething doesn't lick DonalDumb in emote or vice versa which could be only fair and polite for sure but still it's quite immersion breaking and RP servers are all about immersion. 
---
if one on a rp server doesn't care about that immersion or even mock it then he earned his trolling medal and can be proud of it, he contributed for Blizzard to lose more subs.
---
this
---
It's about 90% a PvP thing, for sure.
---
Yea, furious howl rank 3, you will only upgrade it in lower blackrock spire at 56-57 (when you can tame a bloodaxe worg).
---
I've been thinking of investing in property in the lowlands of 1k Needles. It'll be a fine home for years and years to come !
---
you rushed to endgame what do you expect?
---
I bet you're fun at parties
---
Those are very good points. I've never played WoW before, so I didn't consider the lore aspects as much, since I'm still learning it, and the lore I do know is exclusive to Classic. 
---
The only other system for account wide progress that I can think of is from SWToR, I believe it was called a "Family tree" or something like that. It let you share reputation and certain account bonuses across characters. It never went very far, because the game died shortly after that, but I think some similar system would work for WoW. It would have to be faction specific though.
---
your fault
---
Ooof, was hoping for more time.  Without BG's this seems like there is a high chance a lot of the casual pop still grinding out levels 50-60 will just rage quit.  I'm really enjoying classic and I'd love to hit endgame but if the few hours I do get to play involve getting steamrolled by hordes of 60's... I guess I'm out.
---
All pets are designated female by default because the game has to assign them gender so the value doesn't read null.
---
In lore, void walkers are unknowable Eldritch Horrors beyond our petty concept of gender.
---
Lmao ok I guess you're bankrupt bud because all your possessions are not equal to money. See how stupid that sounds? Run along now kiddo.
---
My bad
---
Lmao I just saw the bot too. When the toxicity gets so serious that suicide awareness bots start contacting us.
---
Woah, I think I saw that happened just yesterday while doing cursed crew, but would never care to notice until now
---
Warrior here. I give mana pot and high lvl water i find in dungeons to healers. I also help killing npcs if i am going the same way no matter if alliance or horde. A few race/gender/class combos gets NOTHING!   
---
I also tends to taunt if people are about to die. A few times my taunt lands just as the poor guy dies and i feel kinda bad hehe.
---
And you gave the most incorrect answer by not understanding the question lmao
---
Could someone please explain to me how the raid timers work in this game? Would I be able to raid with a PUG and my own guild within the same week?
---
Also, what kind of raid looting system do you guys think is the best/most fair? Different guilds have been reaching out to me but they all use different looting methods.
---
Oh yeah? The infamous “Classic mindset.” The mindset that you can play a ret paladin, a balance Druid, a shadow priest, or some other utility spec and that’s fine because play how you want. But a warrior wants to dps and all the sudden they don’t have the “Classic mindset.”
---
Maybe they’ve never tanked before and weren’t comfortable doing it? Maybe they genuinely just had to go? Regardless, you sound absurd trying to dictate how people play and then talk about the “Classic mindset.”
---
I don’t take offense people usually make fun of palas outside of holy ;)
---
Without any additional context this just looks fuckin weird.
---
That's a nasty buff.
---
Unless I'm mistaken, you can't be summoned while you have this!
---
Very bad for raids..
---
I'm getting popcorn for this!!
---
Tauren Druid here. I don’t know how many times I’ve watched alliance gank people around me, but for whatever reason leave me alone. 
---
A skull mage was killing me before. I slowly walked towards him in bear form, /moo a few times. He stopped casting on me and /pet me and was on his way.
---
These are great tips.  
---
To further on tank marking targets.  If you notice the tank is not attacking skull, you should still attack skull.  The tank will be juggling threat, and by marking that target they're saying that they expect it to be first to die and first to receive threat from the DPS.  Don't get creative until you start getting the feel of the rhythm of pulls.  
---
As a warlock, one of the dangerous things you can do is cross dotting.  This means putting your dots on things that are not the primary kill target.  If you do this, make sure you pay attention to what happens and change your behavior accordingly.  It can up your DPS a lot if done well, but if mobs start chasing you everywhere, slow it down.  
---
Don't dot things that are marked to be crowd controlled as it will break sheep, sap, etc.
---
Side note, how has Auctioneer been working for you? I cleared the data once and rescanned and it seemed to ignore all the items it had just scanned. Been using Auctionator since then but it doesn't have the market price features that I like from Auctioneer, since the "market price" is just the lowest price listed which isn't accurate.
---
Remember, there are 4 armor types. Plate is not the same as mail. You might be saying, ok time to (shaman) start doing my mail armor. And do need on some plate.  
---
Insta kicked lol.
---
how about when im shoving handfuls of chips into my mouth while trying to play
---
I wouldn't really consider someone who averages 4+ hours a day to be a casual. Maybe not hardcore either, but definitely not casual.
---
Jesus Christ those crits baby!!
---
Dps warrior is one of the highest in the game at 60. They are also one of the most gear dependent.
---
If you are a low level, you aren’t going to see that as much.
---
Warrior is the best dps, at least once geared. Better than rogue. Better than mage.
---
Don't do this, If you are horde spam hamstring instead of slam to get WF procs and not reset your swing timer.
---
The problem with this is that it is really hard to to spot who is at fault unless you are paying very close attention to everyone (which only the tank/healer might be doing).
---
A group wipes because an enemy fled, aggroed another pack, and eventually the healer went oom resulting in a wipe.
---
Whose fault was it?
---
It might be the tank for failing to pulling to an unsafe spot, and failing to gather the adds, causing the cloth dps get aggro. The tank may also have forgotten to used defensive CDs.  
---
It might be the DPS, for failing to maintain target priority, allowing the first enemy to flee, or allowing the tank to take hits from many low health enemies. The DPS could also be responsible for pulling aggro, forcing the tank to blow taunt, causing it to be on CD when the crisis hit.  
---
It could be the healer, by using inefficient spells, and failing to make use of the 5s rule.
---
Most players (including you) think that they are not the problem, but that is rarely the full truth.
---
Every guild do shitty things like that.
---
Mine now ex-guild tryed to pull that one on us after the 1st run.
---
We disbanded and created another one.
---
Hopefully this time won't be any DKP drama.
---
I know that RETAIL BADE CLASSIC GODE, but fucking hell that’s an almost provably wrong opinion. I’ve never seen better PvP content than the WoTLK days.
---
Hehe, time for a little breather.
---
You look ridiculous.
---
So soon?! Damnit. If they keep launching better gear, the people who took their time leveling will never be able to get into raids. Elitists will ask for unrealistic gear from Naxx to get into MC.
---
Holy guacamoly that UI is sick, well done. Gives me the diablo 2 feels
---
Introducing BGs wouldn't stop you from doing that.
---
I absolitely might be wrong here (god knows I did not look up that much tanking guides yet, only some skarms vids), but I think there is likely a reason why all prot warr pre-bis gear is about defense and the only hit item is a crossbow that most people won't bother to go for.
---
Does this effect anything other than undead models? f.e. is it full Chinese client, or just undead?
---
Some of the purists want the Southshore/Tarren Mill experience. It was before my time personally (i joined vanilla abound ZG's release) but i can understand why it is important to some (was nostalgic enough to create a battleground) and while it's not for me, is essential  to the classic experience for some and the presence of structured pvp immediately may dilute this.
---
That said, yeah if it was up to me and my personal tastes id release bgs with phase 2.
---
This isn't even a particularly creative or unique "tradition".  I've been in several guilds that do the same over the years.
---
The dude enjoys being generous and helping people, dont see how that makes him an idiot
---
I think it is a bit like mage in that although there are undoubtedly some really dumb ones out there excluding them from consideration for a dps spot a priori would be downright insane.
---
Uhm ... who cares?
---
Never did understand why people get all riled up over popular streamers. Not only here, but on other games too.
---
So you’ll be a shaman, I’ll be a hunter. This is actually pretty exciting lol! What race will you play? I totally forgot I could be a dwarf, and I LOVE dwarves!
---
&gt;tree of corruption
---
*angry night elf noises*
---
Well anyway i can only wish you good luck. Pvp as ret can be fun too.
---
Welcome to classic where some quest are time wasters.
---
Tier gear progression is not the same thing.
---
I'd sell it now. Sure, you can get 250g for it in a few months maybe, but is 50g worth more now than 250g five months down the road? In my opinion, yes. 
---
I sold an epic one handed sword for only 18g for that very reason. Yeah, it's probably worth 40-50g once more people get higher levels and start making twinks (it was a level 36 PvP sword), but the 18g has more buying power now than the 40g would in several months.
---
This guy is in Burning Steppes and all his quest text is batshit crazy
---
Do it now!
---
Well you should stop making out with cats then.

Probably worth a decent bit, I can see healers/casters loving this. Although I'm not sure what other options they have for bracers, so I may be wrong.

Fury warrior can be one of the best if not the best dps melees. But they are Kind of limited by their threat gen. Also, they need a little bit of equip for it.
---
For a Warlock 60, is one professions duo better than the other between: Herbalism/Alchemy and Tailoring/Enchanting?
---
I sometimes put my character on autorun and do something else in the room. If I notice I need a minor adjustment on the direction I tap the arrow key. Faster than grabbing a mouse and turning with that.

Ok lets be honest here following Blizzard's usual pattern with this kind of stuff that means most likely December if it follows the Hearthstone and "Classic" pattern (classic announced for summer 2019 released 3 days before Autumn Hearthstone announced for April normally last Wednesday of the month). However it may also be November if following the predicted new pattern for classic and retail month and a half cycles (1 month 15ish day classic release 1 month 15ish days retail release).

Ah thanks for the insights, it really felt like I couldn't keep up damage wise so perhaps plate will turn the tables. I was also thinking maybe I was trying too hard to play footsies with rogues and need to be better with hamstring and just face tanking them. I do use demo shout as best I can to knock them out of stealth.
---
Hello. I have a question about which tank class to roll. 
---
So my friend and I are going to level as a healer/tank combo by spamming dungeons. I’m rolling tank, and want to know the pros and cons of druids and warriors when it comes to tanking 5 mans. Which one would be better for fast and relaxed clears? I’m leaning towards Druid because swipe seems to be really strong for aoe aggro, where warrior seems to only have thunderclap early on. I could be totally wrong though as i haven’t tanked in Classic. 
---
What are your thoughts on the two classes?
---
I have started this in my realm. So far sent around 25 mails before daily mail cap. I will share results with you!
---
Yes not only competent but in phase one is the best dps.
---
Yes they need the best gear, the right spec and of course someone with at least have a brain playing it
---
This is exactly what I did as a hunter. Pet pulled and FD my way to the area then did this.
---
Low effort troll
---
I use the axe from rare spawn in lbrs that has a 609 armour reduction debuff that stacks with sunder no it’s not bis but it works atm.
---
Uhhh, have you not even seen Reckful 3?
---
Well thats just an ass hole. They exist.
---
It’s pretty meh for resist purposes. Someone might want it for cosmetic purposes, but it’s pretty easy to get.
---
I got 2 grinding basilisks from 40-45 to get mount gold.
---
Hey I mentioned I was playing alliance but actually that sounds like solid advice. This is a very quiet zone and I still have some higher level quests to finish. Ty
---
Recklessness. 100% crit chance for a few seconds
---
It's on the wow website free download
---
I know I’m being a smart butt but it is the highest FPS in the game not one of the highest lol.
---
Yes I will, thanks for the support.
---
This is wrong, don't use slam if your horde
---
so the roleplayers should only roleplay in private channels, no more public display in /say and /tell. then how the other roleplayers are going to join them? and why restricting actual roleplaying on a roleplay server? oh for the non roleplayers .. but I've read other proposition in the last days like RP-PvP server are not RP servers and all RPers should go on the RP-PvE servers. or RPers should never RP on lieu of passage like towns or frequented places, they should hide, .. et cetera, all about restricting RPers on RP servers .. WTF?
---
If you are not solely focused on DPS, then leaving Devilsaur and your second axe, which are mostly DPS only items for last makes total sense. Edgemasters can also be used to tank better if you are using a 1h weapon that it gives you +skill for and didn't have +5 skill from your racial already, but it doesn't have the best defensive stats, of course. From reading your previous posts I assume you are an Orc? You can / should just skip Edgemasters then, you can get better gloves, which give you more power than what you'd gain from going 305 -&gt; 312 weapon skill as explained in detail with the [weapon skill table here](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/warrior-dps-pve-stat-priority).
---
You can layer hop 6 times and only ever enter 2 different layers.
---
grow thicker skin stop letting people on the internet put you down.
---
I just added 3 new mirror links. Let know if those are not working. I wasn't expecting this much traffic. LOL Im sorry. Its just my personal google drive. I guess I'm kind of newb when it comes to file sharing.
---
yeah I am aware... I am just stating the obvious kill potential is EZ WHEN ALL YOU DO IS CRIT
---
Yeah but you can just get to lvl40, then do it, because it will be more gold per hour at lvl 40 and you will know how much you need. There's really no reason to start now.
---
As for gold making grinds while leveling, cougars in SoS at 37-39, and gorillas/basilisks at 40-42 in STV.
---
I don’t get why people do the trade chat window thing without even asking first.  Had a guildie yesterday tell another guildie that had some lock boxes that needed picked to go up to any rogue open trade chat and put them in the “item not to be traded window” and have them pick it.
---
I feel like this kind of stuff is a bit rude tbh.  Why not just ask if they say no then move on to the next.  I don’t understand why people feel the need to expect it from mages, rogues, warlock summons etc.
---
I dunno about the lists in general but in my guild we have a few KoS targets between the boys. We drop whatever we are doing if "Clickerqt" is anywhere in sight.  Or any member of &lt;Deja Vu&gt; on Earthfury. I am pretty sure our guild is KoS to many of them as well.
---
All you need to do is ask ;) or find us on FB @szklonawarsztacie
---
How did you not get honored with your own faction before level 40?  You do the starter quests for a different faction instead?
---
&gt; I would definitely not spend epic mount amounts of cash on Edgemasters as a human.
---
I already did on my main mage that's why I'm crying. Edgemaster's price have plummet since :'(
---
My warrior is human, around lvl30. Maybe I should keep the edgemaster in case I get axes? With using devilsaur set in the meanwhile?
---
How does this spreadsheet work?
---
Well I usually use tyehe mouse to turn but during long autoruns I might do something else in the room. If I then notice I need a small direction adjustment I just tap the arrow to wanted direction and return to what I was doing.
---
I have been really missing low level battleground.
---
What about hunters?
---
I totally get people needing to acquire leveling gear....but this was a ret pally rolling on a very obvious hunter dps item (read: mail legs with +20 agi, +bow skill, +9 int) because the “int makes it healing gear”
---
His current healing pants shared the same int he said but were cloth...so the armor difference is why he felt he could need it
---
For PVE both are solid healers that will always be in demand but I’d give the edge towards shamans for the utility/ totems they bring.
---
In PVP (assuming you mean BGs) both are better off adopting hybrid specs. I’m generally not a fan of Resto Druids in BGs because of slow cast times and dispellable HoTs, so maybe Shaman again, but to be fair a BG would welcome any healer tbh. If you really want the best PVP healer id consider a pally.
---
Basically just pick whichever style suits you more and you’ll be fine.
---
Awesome every 3 minutes* ;\^)
---
There's times when both are required, plain and simple. There are times when one is more ideal than the other. There's lot's of reasons why someone might turn with their keys. If you think you're some how a better player by never using the keys to turn at all or that you're gonna shame people that do so, you're a fucking moron.
---
I’m a hunter that knows what is and isn’t a hunter weapon 
---
I wouldn’t reserve items myself since I can’t be bothered to create a group myself 
---
But reserving things doesn’t affect anyone at all bc you can just choose another group 
---
Or where you talking about the guy I was referring to, if yes i agree with you
---
this is literally a bot trap in action lol
---
if they ask politely decline and tell them ur dps
---
if they try to force you just leave lol
---
Idk what this is from it it reminds me of escape from witch mountain for some reason
---
I think you're supposed to complete much of it before 30 if I remember correctly. Whirlwind axe is the "lvl 30" quest.
---
But other than that, WoW Classic is an adventure.
---
KEK
---
It can give you a "free" Rage boost (30 min cd iirc?) at maximum level, so if you want to get it eventually, might as well.
---
If you don't care about getting free 50 Rage (before combat since the stats suck) every 30 minutes just skip it, its a pretty lengthy quest.
---
Oh no I'm not actually new, it's just part of the joke (parodying the many "New Player gets Mount" posts floating around). Though to entirely honest I'm not really very experienced either. My only WoW experience before this was leveling a warlock to level 32/33 on a private server years ago. So newish?
---
As for gold-making, I guess it's mostly just experience from other games with auction houses, or things similar to auction houses (Dofus, ESO, Warframe.market). I'm a bit nonplussed by all the fuss, but also grateful that no one can see the current contents of my bank :/
---
Ah no problem dude, if I roll on there I will definitely give you a shout! Thanks for the replies!
---
Yup.  That was my original main toon.  Then I got really sick of sitting in trade chat spamming to find tanks for dungeons, so I went and made my own and it’s my main now.  Warlock just sitting with cobwebs at 34.  But fully rested XP!
---
Competent warriors are very competent in dps. Incompetent warriors are not.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/dps-rankings-tier-list-for-wow-classic
---
They are listed 3rd best DPS as of now. So yeah they do a good job.
---
Reserving is for gear you actually need too doe
---
Aye, we're in the same boat
---
Maybe he thinks that aggro range is a bug? Not sure
---
Profession combinations and your class don't matter. Tailoring gets you an epic class robe, engineering gives tons of gadgets mostly useful for pvp, every other profession exists solely to make money.
---
Alchemy won't be a good money maker until at least phase 2 when people start using pvp potions, and p3+ when people start using flasks. Though you do have arcanite transmute so it's okay for passive income. Enchanting is mostly good if you farm rare recipes or get them from guild raids. Tailoring isn't great for money making besides 1 mooncloth every 4 days. Herbalism can be decent money but there isn't much demand for herbs currently (again, low demand for endgame potions/flasks).
---
Yeah, I think AQ will need room to breathe, and I think/hope that one will actually take some time to accomplish due to the war effort. Again, I don't necessarily think 2 months per is correct, but at least for such a small update like Phase 2, we'll definitely need Phase 3 almost right after.
---
you may not have, but we did
---
mine always wanted a belly rub before he would dissapear
---
I did that back in the day.  I need sleep now or I’m useless at work
---
What pet would be ideal for a BM Hunter to solo Maraudon? I've seen DPS heavy pets mentioned a lot but I dont see much mention of turtles. Wouldn't their survivability and armor rating make them the ideal option?
---
Not exactly the same issue but Blizzard support gave me the old copy paste reply so I just remade the ticket adding in that the last guy didn’t answer my question about 3 times. 4th time had an actual person answer my ticket and got it resolved.
---
Wait priest does not have battle res, so what good of him In this situation? Saving 20 seconds got pally not to res all? 
---
And me (warlock) would definitely not take S priest, competition for cloth and no dps vs the rest. No cc either
---
I'm still getting the same result for all three, I don't know what the deal is. Thanks for trying! They'll work again eventually and I'll get them. I saved the post.
---
They are talking about reserving all righteous orbs for a live Strath run.
---
Reserving a piece of gear so other warriors etc. Don't need is a completely different thing.
---
It's the go-to threat build for sword and board, dw tanking would be 3/31/17
---
Impale really starts to shine with world buffs and consumables, you're probably looking at close to extra 20% crit or even more, and an extra 20% damage on your crits multiplied by the def stance modifier is huge for threat
---
&lt;Cheeks&gt; on Benediction, we "clap" in the chat when someone joins.  Because clappin cheeks is what we're about and Cheeks clap together.
---
Bank alts. That’s how a lot of us made most of our money.
---
That’s totally fine.  It doesn’t matter, it was a funny moment and I thought it was worth sharing lol.
---
Fuck I'm so jealous.
---
I'm doing it similarly, but not quite so extreme. I have one of each class and they range from level 10 to 30. I definitely try to put the most effort into the 30 (druid), but I'm also trying to use rested as much as possible. I use an addon (Titan Panel +rested xp) to track rested, so if any class gets close to max rested I play them for a bit. If you want to experience end game content you might need to concentrate on one or two characters and just play the alts when you're sick of the main.    
---
For me it's not a commitment or indecisive thing, I simply enjoy leveling more than what awaits me at 60. I don't have time to raid anymore, and I don't really enjoy PvP that much. I've been an altoholic since vanilla, and I had no problems raiding and leveling several 60's back then. It's just a matter of how much time can you play.
---
Yeah I know. I didn't make the initial flight paths. I think they were formed to avoid hitting all the text.
---
Nope, an extra 14 damage per tick for SW:P at lvl 40 would be laughably OP lol.
---
It’s by no means a bad bonus you just have to decide what’s more valuable compared to other pieces. Generally I’d say it’s better to focus on spirit &gt; int gear while levelling, but if the option is a +14 shadow damage cloak compared to say your current level 25 cloak that has +4 int, the extra shadow damage might be a worthy upgrade.
---
You're likely only looking at a mitigation list. Tank warriors have like 3 pre-bis lists with multiple variations between them (threat, mitigation, resist). Tanks don't get to just grab one set of gear and say "OK, got my prebis!" With the current content the need for mitigation gear is very low. So low that it's pretty much never correct to opt for it over threat unless your healers are really underperforming.
---
Relevant*
---
I somewhat agree with what you say, however, I'd still say you would be the asshole in that situation. Here's why: the way I see it, the default interpretation of the need/greed system is that need is for stuff you want because you intend to use it, while greed is for stuff you want for it's monetary value. So as long as your group didn't agree to different rules, these rules are in place. If you now use need on an item that you intent to sell, you are unilaterally changing the loot rules in your favour. This is especially true if someone else rolled greed before you did.
---
I think the best way to avoid this is to discuss the loot rules before you even start.
---
Tanking in classic sucks balls. You do your job and still get bitched at when some mage pulls aggro somehow.
---
Funny isn't it? Does anyone else see the direction video games are heading in the future? It's what the people want! /s but please downvote anyway
---
Shadowprey village, get 5 crawdads/lobsters from some traps on the sea floor.
---
Not sure how you will get anywhere near 20g / h without druid aquatic form though, sounds very excessive.
---
This is so nice. I'm in the same boat. It makes for nice and easy Sunday morning questing.
---
Zug Zug!
---
I agree, I’ve taken my time and I don’t expect everyone to have to wait up for me, but this does seem quite soon. 
---
My fear is that they’re too overzealous with adding the new phases and we’ll have already run out of phases by the end of next year
---
Where do you get this mod for Classic? I see it on curseforge, but it's for version 7.3.2 or something like that.
---
I wouldn't make my group wait for me to hand it in.
---
.... yes you seem to have found the punch line of his joke.
---
They're fine. You'll just have more issues with 40%~ of horde players being UD and having WoTF.
---
Ooooo what happened?
---
Thank you for your service..!
---
Not op but hes probably referring to the shellfish quest in desolace. Dive down and open cages for shellfish. I'm not too sure but I think it's something to the effect of 50s for 5 or 10 shellfish.
---
Why the downvotes lol...
---
TM vs SS should not be your biggest worry. World bosses should be. There will be thousands of players at once trying to kill these on big servers, and the servers can't handle it.
---
Oh yeah? Where’s that source?
---
Did you know, or did you just think it would and are pretending you “know” because it’s the internet.”
---
This a addon?
---
Yeah desolace is much more chill. You should be aware that the PVP will likely ramp way up compared to what it is now because honor system will be coming out. I'd advise you to consider a pve server if ganking bothers you a lot, it's not going to decrease or go away
---
I started with auctioneer and hated all the bloat in the tooltip, so I tried auctionator.
---
Auctionator like you said shows weird pricing and I found auctioneer is a little more consistent with the price (more accurate?).
---
I had both active to compare and for an item, auctionator was ~25% off on the price I would expect to sell/buy an item for, which auctioneer was like ~5% off the correct price after just scanning them.
---
Also auctionator wouldn’t update certain items after a scan, so half the greens in my bag wouldn’t have a price listed, even though there’s an exact match of that item up for sale currently.
---
Maybe I just don’t know how to use them.
---
I see people who say they play 2 hours a day and are 60. I would say they have people helping them or they REALLY have some good system in place to just focus on leveling
---
Some dude was working on his THIRD FUCKING 60 on another thread.
---
I just hit 44. I have pretty much the same playtime as you.
---
I would like to see peoples /played
---
To add to the tank thing, sometimes DPS open as I run in and think it's fine because they don't die.. Which is true, but if the mobs run off to them for 2 seconds on a pull, that's less rage for me and less rage means I can't hold the other mobs either. It gets you through a dungeon but as a tank I'd have so much more fun if DPS realized that when they open as we run in, it forces us to auto hit.
---
Getting older is a strange thing... When I was a kid I did everything in my power to show how "mature" I was and I loathed those adults who treated me like a kid. Now that I'm an adult... Fuck, kids/teenagers are so incredibly insanely annoying and they don't even realize why. It's hard to explain, too... I read some old emails from highschool (from me) and I cringed myself out. Fuck young me, that guy might have been trying hard, he was a still a piece of shit.
---
Run BFD, tame Ghamoo-Ra (turtle boss), watch him shrink to housecat size, cherish your fearsome boss pet.
---
i did this for about 1 hr and got about 5g. i was like 33 or so, wasnt doing it for the gold, really did these for the Big iron fishing pole. ended up getting two sold the other for 1g to guildy. If you plan on doing this, farm mats and craft Azure silk belt (12% swim speed)
---
This is some sound advice and give me a good insight on guild structure. I guess I should have mentioned that I did do many things with the guild. Like I said this was a small guild very short on tanks. They had a Druid MT and the rest of the wars were fury. I made a point reply to everyone who asks questions. I’ve helped about 4 people do the annoying UBRS key(which I don’t have myself), tanked Jailbreak many times at 60”, tanked UBRS to help get some guys get ONY attuned. It was going great. Until the merge then everything pretty much switched up.
---
Hunter dwarf! like the trailer! eheh
---
Looks like a whole lot of guesswork without a source.
---
I forget not everybody has tooltips on the cursor location sometimes lol. It looked like it was taken from a different zone though with the green color.
---
Thanks for point that out! I am thinking of version 2.0 at this point. So much help comments.
---
time to skeet out and find a guild mworth ur time bro
---
Derp! Autocorrect!
---
*You’ve done it. You’ve broken the defenses of Ulduar.*
---
Nah, you paid legion farm and they forgot to use the VPN 🤣
---
You’re right... FUCK. Broken game. Unplayable.
---
&gt;I won't ask a lvl 60 to give me bread when i'm 35 obviously, but i'll ask someone of the same lvl.
---
Why not? They make it in 1 click for 20, people at lower levels need to spend an entire mana bar and maybe get 10 breads/waters.
---
The brawl is fun even if they're only rotating ARAM right now. They just do it better than League.
---
Good luck! 
---
Just one last thing about gold; I've been steadily making very decent money running dungeons most of the time, I'm at 500 gold now, I haven't kept exact track, but I would estimate about 20 - 30 gold per run, and that is not counting recipes you could get or mats like Orbs for the Crusader enchant that can net you a lot of money.
---
No it is not worth, just stick with the chest and quest. You would quickly replace the rest of the brutal gear
---
You still need 1 hand to do that, might as well be your mouse hand. You can move with just the mouse by holding both L and R buttons together.
---
I didn't downvote you mate but you should get your keyboard checked
---
Tailoring gives you the ability to make Robe of the Void which is pre raid BiS. You can drop tailoring after you make robe but if you plan on using the Bloodvine Garb which is BiS through phase 5, you need 300 tailoring to equip.
---
It's only the salty alliance members tho! Not the rest of us common folk! Lol
---
&gt;level 20.  Shit game
---
Really gave it a fair shot, didn’t you?
---
Well, I'll conceded that this particular instance is, in fact, palatable. While this one is discernible, the fidelity frustration is born from the fact that people can just press print screen (or, hell, sometimes I use the snipper tool if I just want a screenshot of a small portion of my screen) and get a significantly higher quality image. 
---
It's kind of like... Eating a slice of cold leftovers vs just reheating them in the microwave. I mean sure, all the flavors are there and I KNOW what the meal was... but it is not a lot of effort to just nuke something for a couple minutes for a less-sad time.
---
His question makes perfect sense to me. He didnt ask why peopl turned their keyboars, he asked why people turned WITH their keyboard. The existence of that "with" makes it pretty much impossible to interpret it how you did.
---
Apologies accepted though :)
---
STV is good up until 225. 
---
Not sure if fishing in a lower zone still gives skill-ups. I don't generally fish in lower zones, so never really tested it.
---
I'm kind a classic noob but pretty sure fear ward is better than will of the forsaken or am I wrong?
---
I initially took tailoring/enchanting for my priest and I definitely regret getting enchanting. It’s a massive gold sink to level and it only really starts to become profitable if you get recipe drops from high end content, so if you’re not planning on raiding deeply then it’s not worth it tbh. I kept tailoring to help me level and so I can get the BiS chest.
---
Honestly, my advice is to pick up at least one gathering profession to make you some gold, and then switch to a crafting profession at lvl 60.
---
The chest is great for if you need Rage in a pinch, the others not so much...
---
WW Axe I think is worth it, simply because it is the best weapon you can get in the lower 30's range until you can get Ravager from SM Armory, but it is an investment. Most of the materials you can get in the auction house, but you'll still need to go to Stranglethorn Vale to farm troll tusks and you'll DEFINITELY need help against the final level 40 elite you have to fight. Plus getting it is kind of a Warrior tradition lol. That all being said, you could probably make do with another weapon until you can farm Ravager, but those other options are sub-par...
---
imagine thinking everyone picks their race based on the racial...i know some do but honestly those types kinda suck at the game regardless, hence the doing everything possible to gain any advantage they can. wotf is not nearly as op as you think. usually you pop it to get rid of the fear then youre usually just refeared after by the lock. Spriest is stronger against but still. also not too many spriest anyway.
---
There was just too much at steak.
---
Yes I am old. I came back to classic wow (been 15 years) , joined a guild and asked if they had vent servers. 300 people in the guild- no one heard of it. Well kids, I ve never heard of discord before :)
---
Educated guess work but yes guess work none the less.
---
Yeah no
---
If you want no deadzone roll a mage
---
The bragging is the video
---
Yo I was trolling for the past two messages, but super funny you just call me a racist out of the blue rofl
---
Never been in a guild with so many active players :(
---
&gt;HotW/N
---
how were you hotw/ns before hitting 60? you can't level up having both hotw and ns unless you mean the last 3-4 levels
---
You can farm stratholme live for blue bullets or lbrs for blue arrows, they drop 50-200 at once.
---
But really, don't use them unless in raids or for bosses only.
---
You're also scaring me by telling me that thorium bullets are expensive. I hope they're not more than 20s a stack..
---
They’re on call 24/7 and can’t ever say no.
---
You don't have to sit in a city though. Just /join World and advertise there while questing. If you get an offer you like, hearth, sell the item, and back to grinding with little to no interruption.
---
People joke about it all the time but I put WoW on my resume and it's, at least part of, why I got my current job. Used to be in a leadership position and their and pretty direct translation between leading a raid of 25 idiots and managing a team of 25 idiots (no I didn't mis-count that, everyone in the raid is an idiot, just how big an of idiot are you?)
---
It is because it is a 30 second cd
---
yea but undead SP get devouring plague
---
Orc Rogue?
---
Agreed,  huge waste of time and money,  never understood it
---
Paid class change? They have server, race and faction changes on retail, but class - how would that even work? Say you have a warrior decked out in tanking gear, and decide to reroll hunter, how what? :D
---
Raids are like this too.
---
Tanks, healers, melee and ranged commonly have their own role leaders, as they have different abilities and mechanics to work with. 
---
Even "simple" Patchwerk (blatant gear check) has to coordinate threat, as Fury Warriors do not have a threat dump, to avoid a Fury Warrior from becoming the Hateful Strike tank. **If** he survives, the Rage generation for both the Warrior and the healers would be amazing.
---
It's not about the color palette, it's about the bosses. I was very happy to leave behind the grey and green of the Tomb of Sargeras for the grey and green of Antorus when it released, because it had new fights. BWL has some really cool fights even when on farm, like Chromaggus switching elements every week and Nef's class callouts.
---
Blasted lands mobs around dark portal
---
Just price them to move.  
---
Tell me, what makes more sense; listing the same item multiple times a gold or two under the market price (and thus paying the listing fee a couple of time) or listing it at like 10-20g under the market price and actually getting a sale the first time.  
---
Realistically, you could just figure out the listing price, multiply that by a number of times you'll think you'll have to relist it, and then undercut the market by a number that is a bit less than what you came up with. That way, you're item sells, you list it once, and you optimized the amount you would get/spend on listing it.  
---
Make sense?
---
I haven’t played WoW in years and I didn’t understand the thought process when filling raid groups so I came to reddit for insight. Thanks for your reply.
---
Ty man for the great tips !
---
Its useless without transmog.
---
Vendor it and enjoy your gold bonus.
---
I have started doing this a bit.  It is because of the mouse sensitivity bug.  When mouse turning, sometimes I end up doing a 480 degree turn (I spin rapidly) for no reason.  Has caused me to fall of cliffs and stuff.  I have tried to fix it (even put in a ticket), but nothing works, so I have started using the keyboard to turn sometimes when near a cliff or a boss and am worried about the 'you are facing the wrong direction' issue.  So I think I am justified in my keyboard turning lol
---
The only piece that wasn't really worth it was the pants imo. The helm was useful for quite some time and so was the other piece, for me at least.
---
Id be careful with listing weapons. But decent greens are hella worth to sell.
---
Be a Shaman. Target a Mob at the lower end of your level range, drop stoneskin and healing stream, alt tab. Check back in a couple minutes to redrop the totems and toss a heal.
---
My God dude.
---
He means they shouldnt be in prot gear on most flights where hes necessary.
---
Warrior damage is good so he should have dps build and gear when not tanking. He shouldnt waste that dps with nightfall
---
Yikes, even less impactful than I thought then :( I didn't do mine yet, to be fair, although I've been 60 for a while now.
---
That's a really fair point, since I'd technically be able to roll on 2 types of gear which would definitely be uncool, (although a lot of druid tank gear is literally only wanted by druids).

With the amount of yolo-style, undergeared 2h "tanks" I came across while leveling that last sentence is dangerous to voice aloud. Now that I've gotten into BRD and later dungeons it's getting better, but it seems some clueless and/or poorly geared people just sign up as tank without knowing what to do in leveling dungeons. Often that reflects both on the survivability as well as the threat side.
---
Melee white hits are your primary source of damage as a warrior, more so as horde with wf. 
---
Your autos have a flat 40 % chance to glance, glancing blows cannot crit and deal reduced damage, +weapon skill is the only way to increase the damage of your glancing blows, to a maximum of 100% damage at +7-10 skill against boss (level 63) mobs, this is why weapon skill is absolutely the biggest source of damage increase, and gets exponentially better with gear. As glancing cannot crit it also introduces a variable soft crit cap calculated by your miss chance added with your chance to be dodged and glancing and subtracting it by 100, the value is the point where crit only affects specials and drops a lot in value in favour of attack power
---
How do you know?!
---
He's level 61.
---
Didn't know about "World", I only tried join "trading" channel but there was nobody there, thanks I'll try that instead.
---
Eventually you will get desensitized to toxic players. This is just how all mmos are. it is actually impossible to not  run into assholes eventually. It doesnt mean you dont have a place in the game as your post says you had plenty of successful runs and judging from what you explained, you were in a group of idiots who cant see fault on their own play and blame others. (yes i know my grammer is shit)
---
I delayed getting mortal strike/sweeping because I got the 5% crit in fury right off the bat. Not sure if it was really worth it but in the early levels the crit chance really helps with rage generation since you are basically limited to rend and HS anyway.
---
Ooh, Perdition's Blade. Reminds me of my first run in Molten Core. The loot gods smiled on me.
---
They're probably running on &gt;5 year old Dell crap boxes with 4GB of RAM. Not surprised.
---
Any classic Youtubers to recommend?
---
That ref pally was terrible at the end there he ran in circles and never once got in auto attack range he had you beat but he’s just a bad player lol.
---
Must have been edited or I read it wrong.
---
PvP rank works on % basis, doesn't it?
---
IIRC, what matters is how you're performing compared to all the other players of the same faction on your server. 
---
Not how many PvP points you get in a vacuum.
---
Hello, how do I join your guild of heroes?
---
That isn't the actual syntax. They mean to do something like this:
---
/roll 13  
---
60g in 2 hours!
---
Spy has a useful tool for this. Ypu can set the reasons why and they're quite extensive.
---
patreon.com/imadreamwalker I'd assume, or at least a watermark-free version you could get printed.
---
The helm is quick enough to do, since you will go to Camp T and the charred vale anyway.
---
The sen'jin village one is a pain because you have to run from ratchet or org all the way there.
---
I would strongly recommend not doing the wetlands one
---
Honour is percentile based...
---
I think turning with your keyboard is pretty dumb
---
Warriors are pretty ugly ducklings while levelling. But there is a reason top guilds take 15 Warriors for speedruns
---
Refusing to learn a skill that will make your group perform better (because lol fuck retail) makes you the bad player.
---
Enchanters always need materials
---
Really? With SM I went from 32 to 35 in an afternoon. I almost feel like I am lvling up too fast and am missing a bunch of quests and gold and am going to be fucked when it comes to paying for a mount.
---
Lmao. That you mention pvp is hilarious. Not even bother arguing with you. You have clearly no clue. Try disabling auto correction of the camera. Im sure you havent. Imagine keyboard turning in fucking pvp. You're hilarious.
---
You can pick any amount of options, even all of them if you want.
---
Are you the MT of the guild? If so, I think it's pretty acceptable to expect the guild to perhaps help finance pots for the MT. In most guilds I've been in, helping the healers and tanks with funds &amp; raid consumes were normal practice - because it was more difficult for these classes to farm. Have you tried approaching the guild? 
---
Having a MT gquit is a much bigger loss than a DPS. Definitely important to keep them happy :O)
---
Ah, googled it, we played for different teams :). Disciple of Khaine was what I was. Think it was just a mirror of warrior-priest.
---
I'm lvl 57 and have leveled as prot all the way and it's fine.
---
In general it is a bit slower but you're still capable to do it all while you're requested for dungeons and elites.
---
As most melees you rely on your gear/weapon so just keep that up to date. Have enchanting myself so I'm running around with a fiery enchanted trash blade.
---
If you just focus on doing dungeons 24/7 it'll be a breeze but that might be a bit boring in the long run.
---
Chinese gold farmers?
---
That's what they all say. JK
---
Have you been in large scale pvp...?
---
yes. my fault for playing the game.
---
this is why Pserver were stuck at 10-20k pop.
---
You're trying too hard.
---
&gt; Why would anyone delete their characters (Especially at max level)?
---
The dude who got to 60 first in classic was going to delete his character, but people stopped him from doing it by spamming his mailbox.
---
Yeah Im horde so its always Allie but I have seen Horde doing it aswell (until the allie get backup anyway). Which is why I attempt to keep it as "Opposing faction" lol
---
How it feels to chew 5 gum
---
IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET FLIGHTPATH CAMPED, WHY DID YOU ROLL ON A PVP SERVER.
---
They actually won't be. People were farming MC and Ony back then because Ragnaros didn't die until after BWL was released. For the less elite guilds MC wasn't even on farm until AQ was out. 
---
Most guilds already have both on farm right now, and there's plenty of pugs available to catch up. Guild groups will have everything they need from both bosses after doing the content for four months.
---
Looks like a really nice catch-all spec! :)
---
Still sane exile?
---
I've done feralas, searing gorge, and tanaris too.  I pretty much aim for all yellow tier quests. I'll check and see if there are any areas with a lot of green quests, or maybe grind ST and then head in to BRD at 54.
---
Lmao well I'm just gonna go ahead and put your account on follow or whatever so I can see when you post.
---
Tbh I often feel like I'm wasting time if I'm not rested when leveling. So alts are nice for that.
---
I hope they review this, but it also sucks that the only way to get this fixed is by getting some attention on a Reddit post. I feel for the people who've experienced this who aren't on Reddit
---
could i ask what your /played is?
---
Server in this case meaning realm. We in fact know about their infrastructure (and how it's changed) based on the server charity auctions. Originally they sold sever blades badged with realm names, because the job of that physical server blade was to run that particular realm. On the most recent charity auction they say that this can no longer be done because the realms are no longer tied to specific server HW.
---
I don’t watch his stream, or any other WoW streams for that matter, so what’s the big deal? Were they on their way to Org or something? Are they supposed to be, like, the top pvp guild on their server?
---
Vanilla Sweeping Strikes is really insane, and the 1.12 version isn't even the best one that existed.
---
At one point you could execute two targets for execute damage.
---
She was playing a girl character /s
---
I am 99% sure you cant edit reddit titles. Maybe im just too dumb to figure out how but i dont think you can.
---
yes, but I think there are certain min required honor for the higher ranks. You cant get rank 14 for being the only one on your faction with a single kill
---
I mean, You can if you want to
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Should have been 3g 50s
---
You can, you just need to click the ressurection spell and mouse over their corpse, I do it all the time on my paladin :D
---
At 150 I went to Stonetalon so I could keep using the fish I caught to level cooking. (Mudsnappers and Catish roughly 50/50 I think)
---
If anything, it is best that you know the project and team well enough to know what can be done, but not well enough that you can do it for them.
---
&gt;I don't debate over numbers but I do believe that the phases will be tied to the active playerbases progress, therefore asking it to be pushed forward is pointless. They see the exact progress the majority made and can decide what's the overall best decision. If it's 3months then 3 months if it's something else then that.
---
When have I ever said that the current pace is bad or that they should be pushed out faster? You are attacking a strawman here, since I have never said those things.
---
In this thread I have only ever had problem with people who are advocating for blizzard to delay the phases for longer. And wanting for blizzard to release the content EVEN SLOWER than it was released 15 years ago, for their own selfish reasons.
---
If you play it the same as you do retail I’m not sure why you would expect anything different.
---
Relax. You'll get some this weekend
---
That’s not even close to what I’ve said.  But cool.
---
Is there a way to have certain action bars swap when I turn into different druid forms? It seems like only the primary action bar swaps. I'd like to have my other ones swap as well so that I can reuse some key bindings across forms.
---
Nope, it's just you. You are the only unlucky person in existence.
---
I believe you
---
At least I choose to believe you because this really doesn't matter, at all, and there is no cost to me believing you, so I'm going to have a chuckle at the funny moment you experienced and move on with my life
---
Then I cannot read.
---
In PvP, intercept - auto - slam - MS is a lot of burst within the 3 sec stun (if you have 45+ rage)
---
Song name?
---
Nope.  But believe whatever the hell you want, it's no skin off my back.
---
Mouse turning is normally the better way..
---
However, it's not always the better way.
---
Happens
---
Creating an alt named Azerothprime and sending regular weekly stacks of stat food to those who signup for my services!!!!
---
Can’t speak for him, but I tend to think of myself as “casual” because I work 40 hrs a week and enforce a bedtime so I’m dragging on 4 hours of sleep at work. That being said, WoW is pretty much the only thing I wanna do in my free time so it’s not that hard to get off work at 5 and play like 6-10 or something. “Casual” is such an ill defined term that it’s really that useful a descriptor.
---
Haha I have never done it that way. I just have trouble targeting a dead person if they're not in party
---
Any good add on for dungeon map ? With overlay if possible :)
---
I mean, you ask this but it's obvious.
---
It's so clickers can click. That's the only reason you actually have to use it apart from lazy reasons.
---
it's fucking tedious, I refused to do it on my first char in vanilla because it was such a bullshit bore mechanic. In the end after a drunk night, I got my fishing to 300.
---
I've now realised you just have to roll with it and do it for 2 minutes here and there, or when you see one of the pools.
---
Come over to r/classicwow_PvP, there's a priest discussion going on right now!
---
Add me. Azerothprime
---
I bet you’re pun at farties
---
&gt;No, I said epics may be negotiated on a case by case basis. I.e. an epic might be a non BiS upgrade for one guy but a BiS upgrade for a different class.  In that case it makes more sense to roll on it because odds are even the technical upgrade would be a worse choice to equip than to sell. But if a BiS epic world drop happens and the class in question is in the party, I would say need before greed as long as the guy shows that he equipped it right after he got it.
---
Reply to the last guy saying I was agreeing with him
---
That's a shoddy edit in the Greenshot editor, my tooltip is in the same old place.
---
Play with other people? Help other people out?
---
 I mean mechanical downside, what is the downside of playing a Mage?
---
Plenty of classes have a stigma attached to them in Classic.
---
Backpeddling can be viable when you want to go backwards but keep your vision on the situation.
---
It is easier in retail, but for classic it is when we are grouping together. In defense of the GM, we are a guild of many games. Retail &amp; Classic wow is why I am there. We also have people playing Magic &amp; Overwatch.
---
Wow classic drops guild chat after the player drops off. Keeping the chat in Discord lets people join in on conversations in flight or just do the voice chat.
---
Yeah it can cause problems for sure.  
---
So for the OP, the big things I want out of a lock in group as tank would be:  
---
* Don't cross dot if it causes aggro problems.
---
* Do attack the main kill target.  If it's marked great.  If it's not marked, attack the most damaged target.
---
* Do give cookies out (healthstones)
---
* Do not fear
---
* Do not have voidwalker out.  Use a DPS pet.
---
FWIW ever since I switched to an MMO mouse I can't imagine going back.
---
My issue with keybinds alone was I'd only be comfortable binding the 1-5 keys, as well as the keys in close proximity to my WASD keys. With an MMO mouse, even the 6-12 keys are only a slight thumb adjustment from me, and factor in your shift/alt/ctrl + modifiers, and you're essentially doubling the number of 'comfortable' binds at your disposal. This is all the more critical if youre using downranked heals, different stances and what not.
---
They were just roaming around looking for a fight. He’s the server punching bag.
---
Yeah I was thinking I can tank with 31/5/20, I dunno if I could main tank raids with that tho
---
I would add that the majority of people take more like 10 days to hit 60. So  even 4 hours a day isnt enough for one month.
---
The key is to do the lower level quests before you head to stranglethorn. Finish up stonetalon, Barrens. Run the level 30 razorfen at least once for the quests, then head to hillsbrad and STV.
---
To be fair, you are doing content that is 14 years old at this point. When it was originally end game content most of the "BiS" you are wearing didn't have those stats and even if it did, nobody really knew what to wear. This is true at every single level: UI mods that alert you, knowledge of boss abilities and how to optimally handle them, the full breadth and power of consumables, etc.
---
Oily blackmouths are 50c on our server.
---
2560g at lvl 60 not bad :) /s
---
there's a little path off that road that takes you to where those orc's are - left side if you're going away from the Wetlands, right side if you're running toward.
---
Nobody is telling you why faster = better here
---
The only reason faster = better is because heroic strike has a flat bonus threat added to it. Assuming you have a ton of rage (because you are taking so much damage) a faster weapon will give you more HS's, so more TPS
---
I'm sure he meant 31/5/15, but to give you an idea of the spec;
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023250213425100001-05-502301103](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023250213425100001-05-502301103) 
---
This is the same spec I am running, or will be (Currently lvl 49). There is some flexibility on where to stick some points, but it gives you a good solo / dps / PvP spec in Arms, while still giving you some of the functionality to tank dungeons at higher levels. This was a very popular spec back in Vanilla, but its about compromise as you miss out on some key PvP talents and tanking talents. Jack of all trades type.
---
As a healer it doesn’t bother me when people invite me to a dungeon.
---
Are you tanking Strat with your guildies? Then discuss it with them. If it's something important for main tanking raid bosses, they'll probably be okay with it.
---
Are you tanking with PUGs? Then no.
---
A drunk dev hadn't thought it up yet.
---
"cHiLl OuT bRaH, Y u So MaD"
---
Ah, the classic "last word" of the dipshit who's run out of anything valuable to contribute.
---
Thats a nice UI, what one is it?
---
The ettiquette is that most tanks don't realize they aren't actually as valuable as they think they are and they shouldn't be reserving items unless they brought two guildies to back up that claim.
---
Bring 3 players and you can reserve what you want. Be a really good tank with gear that can run a dungeon fast? Take a Crusader Orb.
---
he is in WoD as well https://www.wowhead.com/quest=37148/oralius-adventure
---
Got it, thanks.
---
You are very flexible. You must workout.
---
I mean I've been selling deviate fish for 2g each over on stalagg
---
Oh yeah? Well I won my shammy shield last night!
---
Specifically many fish recipes are from the fishing vendors. Though starting area vendors will carry local fish recipes too
---
Can confirm. Am casul, just hit 39 last night
---
Yea, I mean not like with hundreds of hundreds of people. But yea what I'd consider large scale. The video the other guy posted was ridiculous and nowhere near a common event. Also the private server in the video looked like it was having some serious lag issues too. But still that isnt the point, the point is those are not common events. OP acts like 500 vs 500 pvp battles are the norm that we should hold the standard too and that's ridiculous. In normal play I have not experienced any server issues(besides the ddos days)
---
I dunno, most people seem pretty cool with Nobbel or MadSeason, etc. The chill, informative guys are usually pretty good.
---
On topic, I've watched Thraexs vids as a refresher on LBRS, etc and his stuff is pretty well edited and informative without being overdone or obviously stretched to satisfy the YouTube algorithm.
---
https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/LO0VQ46XB1281555957773363.pdf
---
Those people are just omitting something.
---
Like, they play 2 hours a day now, but they took a week off at launch and got in 60 hours of play that week.
---
Even if you were even on the cost, you'd have to run to the quest area as you wouldn't be able to afford the flightpath back to your zone.
---
Not at all. I haven't reach level 60 yet to start raiding, but my understanding is that it's a lot of re-speccing if you're main tank - deep prot, DPS - DW fury, arms - everything else outside of raiding so... Way of the Warrior.
---
It is. I one shot a priest thru PWS last night.
---
I just finished The Missing Diplomat... Talk about an underwhelming reward for a priest. XP was nice though I guess
---
This is mildly infuriating because ots almost oddly satisfying
---
This looks like it could have easily been resolved if you were active in their discord (assuming they have one), if you would have communicated with them and made friends in the guild and talked to them everyday they probably wouldn't have forgotten about you. Kind of hard to stand out in a guild when it looks like you play alone and don't interact much other then asking for an invite when it comes to the raid starting, did you do any of this?
---
There's no set values for High/Medium/Low. They adjust based on current players online on that server in comparison to the other servers and fluctuate during the day. Low in the morning is not the same as Low in the evening.
---
This is frustrating too, but I won’t pretend to understand mana management. I just want proper threat management. Bonus points for the mana.
---
Can you elaborate a bit? I've never tanked any iteration of an MMO (I'm good at &amp; enjoy healing and a few RL friends have always loved tanking) but I've always heard them say "tanking vanilla/TBC/WotLK was so much harder, threat doesn't matter anymore and everyone AOE tanks" when discussing the newer expansions. It sounds like you might have a different view, so I'm just curious to hear it.
---
The cooking recipes for fishing are bought from Vendors. The ones I can remember off the top of my head: 
---
1. Kelsey Yance in Booty Bay
---
2. Gikkix in Steamwheedle Port
---
3. Vivianna in Feralas. This is in an Alliance only area, I have no idea where Horde go for this one
---
4. I think Winterspring has some, but not 100% sure.
---
Yeah. Its kinda weird but if you jump while your downstairs, you can trigger the rested status.
---
You said fishing was the reason you have 60g and then said you've only spent two hours total fishing. What exactly about OP's comment do you think is inaccurate?
---
I think I'll level my priest now. What's shadow form like? What level do I get it? Thanks.
---
I would say the most important thing is conceptual.  In dungeons, you are part of a team that's goal is to move through the content as efficiently as possible.  To do that, you'll play a lot differently than you do solo.  You probably solo with a voidwalker tanking.  But in a group, there's a dude doing that job.  So put the voidwalker away.  When you solo, you want to crush all the mobs as fast as possible, so you put as much damage on everything you pull as you can.  But in a group, someone else is picking the priority of targets and it's important that they die in the order expected.  Etc.  
---
Just think about making life as easy for everyone else as possible and you'll do fine.  There shouldn't be surprises if everyone does their job well.  
---
Also offer to summon and give out healthstones freely.  Those are great things you can offer the group.
---
There's no way you are casual if you are 56.
---
Maybe you should just rez people
---
Yeah that's not casual. I took the starting week off and am only 56 RN. Have 10 days /played. Im not speed leveling, but I'm certainly not playing slow either. Only taking a few hours here and there to PvP. My friends who casually play are low/mid 40s right now. 
---
The game came out a month ago. If you have 8 days played - thats 25% of your last month being on WoW. I wouldnt consider an average of 6 hours played a day casual by any sense of the word. Thats a second job still.
---
If you have much less than 8 days played than you're way faster at leveling than the average player
---
we don't expect them to roleplay, we expect them to do not disturb roleplay. that means if you want to speak about your new rig or some theorycrafting or any IRL subject then do it but not on /say and /yell that are the very tools for roleplaying. that's it and nothing more. so imagine you want to sale an item, instead of climbing on the roof of the bank of orgrimar and yell WTS with other acronyms following then you send that announce on /trade OR take the time to yell something that fits with roleplaying in a medium age based game. you can yell all day long that you're seeling fish and that yours is less stinky than those of the others as long as you don't yell WTS fish! Cheaper than AH! PM me!
---
No one with a working brain thought phase 1 would last 4 month+.
---
Yikes, as a priest it is our duty to help our brothers
---
Except I've literally changed them both (and observed their impact). So no, you're deadass wrong.
---
I can now see the silithus towers from Shimmering Flats, something I literally couldn't see before playing with these cvars, as well as pushing the fog back and making the game far less claustraphobic.
---
I honestly kind of want to see it drawn. The more goofy the scenario looks the better
---
You have to jump onto the hammocks to get rested. not even joking
---
I agree, but that doesn't really have anything to do with what the intent of your original statement, that people shouldn't roll on gear not designed for the role they are filling in the dungeon. 
---
Paladin taking those pants is just that guy being a tool.
---
As I just pointed out, you sound sad, and as edgy as the guy from OPs picture.
---
It’s funny you’re this tilted over this discussion, I’m not calling you any names so if you can’t keep a civil discussion get the fuck outta here.
---
imagine if that was his last feather but he was just in range for the bow shot..
---
Not really. 
---
There are the lateral motion for that. You turn your camera right and left and alternate beetwen your A and D key (going left or right). This way you still face the mob (can dodge his attacks) even if he's actually on the side of your character. You basically do the same thing but move faster.
---
There's absolutely no point of having the S key binded to" going back". Except maybe for tanks in PvE but that's it.
---
Why doesn't my boar have bite? Level 14. Got it at level 8 in Durotar.
---
Exactly. And the COs that are like what you describe dont last very long or more accurately don't get promoted there in the first place. 
---
Its all about individual elements lead by subordinate officers to co ordinate with other elements to achieve ultimate victory.
---
imagine being enough of a lemming to choose this profession
---
You need to learn the difference between “know” and “thought.”
---
You look like mega man
---
Just stay off the main floor. You can jump up on a bed, stand on a balcony, stairs, or upper terrace, just not on the hardwood.
---
Can confirm, all throughout highschool I felt like I was surrounded by immature idiots. Kids that would be talking in class and then when the teacher tells them they're getting detention for talking in class, they'd burst out "WHAT I DO?????" and get all outraged.
---
I've found that line of sight evens the playing field significantly. If the warrior can find something to hide behind, they can get out of combat to get charge up, or force the mage to come closer. In this situation, the mage will have the option of running away, but cannot kill the warrior.
---
On a flat, open field the Mage should win 100% of the time.
---
He looks like the mini rag pet. Can.. Can I cook with it?
---
Kudos to the craftsmanship!
---
Stop being such a cuck
---
Great quest area but 20g/hr is high.  This area and quest is heavily camped on my server.  I did this on and off as an undead mage from 34-40 when I had time to kill.  I’d say 8-10g/hr is more reasonable.  All depends how many others you’re competing with.  Obviously easier and quicker the higher level you are too.
---
Multi billion dollar company also has an astronomical amount of traffic in comparison. One realm probably has as many players as Nost did at its peak.
---
Asmongold is the DrDisrespect of WoW except he doesn't wear a costume so it's harder to tell that he's putting on a personality. The problem is that there's both fanboys and haters that don't realize that much if it is an act.
---
What the actual fuck. This message was in no way shape or form serious. What the fuck is wrong with you dude.
---
Congratulations, you are now level 62
---
Warden staff is so good...
---
Besides the lack of utility and aggro dumping abilities?  Though even then that isn’t what I remember.  Played a mage in vanilla in a raiding guild and was basically just fighting another mage to be at the top of the meters in virtually every fight.
---
Which isn’t to say that warriors aren’t great when geared.
---
You would try to scam someone for 50 silvers, berate them and ignore them for pricing their services in their own preferred way? Instead of just finding someone in your price range? Seems good dude.
---
Under 1g for all the effort isn't worth it for all people. Especially not 24/7. Being generous and kind isn't a requirement, it's a choice. Clearly the mage in this instance was right not to make a portal for that guy
---
Why would you undercut by 2 or 3 gold? You only need to undercut by 1 copper. You're throwing gold out the window otherwise.
---
We're 6 weeks in if I'm not mistaken. You've been 60 "for a weeks" and after "a few weeks" you find it hard to do stuff? I'd frankly suggest you to flat out switch games. There's tons of stuff to do, but it seems like you'd much more enjoy a game that stuffs weekly glittery bullshit in your face to keep the cheap thrills up.
---
Sorry but I just don't believe that you got nothing to do in a game which people played for years on end with small incremental changes and didn't run out of things to do. Maybe switch to retail and have fun with wendigo pyjamas and dabbing or whatever they added last week.
---
And you aren't entitled to me bailing you out with frost nova/sheeps or giving you mage water. But I still do because im not an asshole
---
40
---
With a user name like that I don’t think you get to have a horse that high. Let people enjoy their shit. If you don’t like it, do something else?
---
I saw a warlock while leveling who had pulled wayyy too many mobs and died. I stood there and watched. I highly doubt we would have killed them if i swooped in.
---
I throw them a resurrection. They take it the proceed to complain that "now i have a repair bill".
---
I didn't get an easy "TY" so i stopped doing that for folks. Guess he wanted to just walk back.
---
i woudlnt mind him that much if he showered every know and then, didnt promote ninja looting and didnt claim hes a god at everything when hes is litereally crap at the game jsut go look logs of hes retail raids or any of hes videos where he is doing arenas lol...
---
*plays priest* *doesnt heal*
---
Boy... this guys gunna have a rough time at 60.
---
Hey awesome!!! Well good on you and fight honorably. I’ll see you on the battlefield, pm me your name if you want me to know it’s you :D
---
I was just annoyed at being called names for the horrible crime of just encouraging the OP to try and market his idea.
---
All I did was click on the thumbnail, see this cool map, and thought 'wow I'd like one of those' and at the same time maybe encourage a budding artist to do something with his talents.  I didn't realize this was all fake and a ripoff and a bunch of fucking assholes would jump all over my shit for suggesting it.
---
Fuck all of you and fuck our stupid map.  I want nothing to do with it now.  Please go DIAF.
---
I'm currently playing as a Druid tank, and I feel like I have to recommend it here. I can do so many things warriors can't- I can pop out of bear and heal, rez someone, innervate the priest, etc. Bear tanks are without a doubt the best 5-man tank in the game.
---
Raids are a different question, and most Ferals respec at this point because they've heard they can't tank raids. This isn't true though, as with a little effort Druids can easily MT most bosses, and are good OT for the others. 
---
If you'd like to read more about Druid tanking allow me to send you treatise

---
I have no problems finding groups as druid healer. I've also not needed to rez in any decent groups, any group that plans on dying isn't a group you want to be in. Druid's bring a lot of utility that keeps the fight going rather than just saves the group from having to run back. 2 strong HoT's, battle rez, ability to offtank, etc.  
---
There are always going to be bad players that think they need a warrior, 3 mages, and a priest otherwise their run is going to take 5 hours longer.
---
What, like, solo?
---
I think I remember this being a gimmick back in vanilla. Do you just run around the perimeter of her island keeping SWP on her and staying away during the fart cloud(s)?
---
There's a soft cap?
---
Yeap, it’s like raiding guilds are treated as a form of work, and everyone gets their own stipend. Tanks and healers usually get more than DPS due to class severity (more DPS than heaps&amp;tanks combined.)
---
I don't care enough to doubt OP, but the movie you watch doesn't imply that it is actual footage from a real event.
---
I think there's two main factors:
---
1) Warriors scale extremely well from gear because rage generation is linked to doing damage and generating rage is linked to doing more damage, they really scale well so they get better as you move up in gearing levels.
---
2) They start with 0 of their damage resource, as a result short fights (like in dungeons or even most of the ubrs I've done) can be kind of underwhelming.
---
3) If you are still leveling (I'm not sure from the post) it's very likely that they aren't fury spec to begin with so they have a spec not optimized for group dps.
---
I was in this boat until 30. Sweeping strikes is a game changer, and anger management is awesome once you get whirlwind at 36. or for tanking earlier than that.
---
It also does in the little alcove directly behind him, noticed this when questing
---
Mages specifically? Nothing lol, theres a reason wrath mage feels so similar to classic mage.
---
what a convoluted reasoning you got there
---
Playing 4 hours a day is definitely NOT casual, just because 1 month and a half after release you have done all mc and onyxia means you have no job, doesn't mean everyone who hasn't is casual.
---
First correction.
---
Second, people like you are a handful by server, last week when census still worked, there wasn't even 200 lv60s, representing less than 0.2% of the total population, and that's how wow got to where it is now : always getting new content released for those 0.2% while the rest of the players were still trying to achieve goals.
---
After a while, you get people leaving the game because they can never achieve any goal at that pace, and then you have blizzard giving dailies and making everything less difficult so that people who don't have 10h/ day to play the game can still achieve something.
---
Ergo, you are the ones that made wow what it is today. Blizzard has ALWAYS released stuff at a high pace, it has always been about making ultra hardcore guilds happy by releasing new content at THEIR pace, and then finding out ways to still keep the 99.9% other players, by making everything easy so more people can follow the rhythm of ultra nolives instead of quiting the game
---
Give us this day our daily bread.
---
Have I seen you guys around on Incendius?
---
I tend to jump around between stances depending on the situation. If I'm fighting a hard hitting mob I just use zerker stance for the berserker rage buff, and then switch to Battle Stance and stay there. Against regular I stick to zerker stance and only switch to battle for the overpower and charge spells
---
typical lazy mage
---
Yeah like i said, you envy him
---
No. I first got Tactical Mastery 5/5 and Anger Management, then Cruelty 5/5, then the rest of my points have been in Prot as I have a consistent dungeon group.
---
Only respec if you know you will be solo for a long period of time. If you get groups quickly because you are a Tank, then if you are alone, just run instances instead. Trying to quest as prot at almost any level is a tedious process, so I recommend that you don't.
---
I use click to move......
---
I".e., for each point that your weapon skill exceeds your opponent's defense, your chance to miss, be dodged, be parried, and be blocked decreases by 0.04%, and your chance to crit increases by 0.04%. Effectively, you can consider weapon skill to be the inverse of the defense skill."
---
Taken out of the WoWwiki article on weapon skill, had to wait until i was off phone to confirm.
---
So no "bruh", it's not 3% hit gained, it's 0.4% hit gained,next time how about you double check the conflicting information being provided rather than straight for the downvote button?
---
Very few classes can do either of those. Are you a druid or pally?
---
Yes. Down the road.
---
As someone whose hunter’s name is Nerfhunters I don’t identify with your post.  I have yet to be in a dungeon and not be top on the meters.  Granted I am only 33.  Though I was tops on the meters at 23 with level 30s.  Last night in RFD it was double the damage of the warlock two levels higher and same level shaman.  Maybe they aren’t the best players, but hunters seem just fine.
---
Don't roll on a pvp server?
---
I sat on the road between gadget and that dock for half an hour last night killing everyone 10lvls below me for fun. That's what this game is for
---
Well you can boot and probably find another rogue. Ez fix
---
It was a joke referencing a subreddit. Calm the fuck down. You getting so defensive about it just makes it look more fake.
---
Unless they cheat
---
Finding the right balance of gear (survivability/threat) is one of those nuances that only comes with experience tanking or healing but sadly it gets lost in the cleaving spam.
---
You lose a significant amount of dmg by going full felheart. Not gonna lie
---
Damnnn what do you do for gold?
---
I always tip mages 1g for a portal, but if his response to asking for a portal is just "1g" I tell that mage to fuck off and I find another one to tip 1g to.
---
Access to their quartermaster (in BRD bar I think)
---
because youre a priest? why wouldnt you heal low lvl dungeons im confused
---
That’s a lot of auto attacks
---
They're the assholes in this situation. You made it clear to them you weren't familiar with &lt;meleecleave&gt; groups and instead of adapting to that and giving you a chance to get the hang of their playstyle, they just flamed you for not playing how they wanted. You're more than welcome to put, the leader in particular on /ignore if he keeps whispering you shit for whatever reason.
---
As for continuing on, you can think of this situation as just one bad spot in an otherwise great experience. If you choose to, you can see if there are any areas you could improve on as a healer or even how the cleave groups work so you'll at least feel comfortable in your own knowledge and abilities. Or just avoid cleave groups in general if you just don't want to deal with that stress. It's your time and money being put into the game, you're more than welcome to play how you want.
---
It is bc the solution if you disagree with it is exactly the same 
---
Don’t join the group
---
They didn’t like it

Stable your current pet. Find a beast with the skill you want to learn and tame that animal. Feed your new pet to at least Content/Yellow. Kill some mobs with the new animal and watch it in action. It won't take long and you'll get a message that you have learned the new skill. You can then abandon the new animal. Go get your pet from the stable, open your spellbook and find the Beast Training skill on your general spells tab. Open Beast Training, find your newly learned skill and click train.

Thx:) nothing specific, I'm kinda new to the game...gonna check him out :)
---
Any chance to provide a [wetransfer.com](https://wetransfer.com) link? All the google drive links are dead and overloaded... :(
---
I mean, if you make an appeal for it, manual review should be the next logical step. 
---
And my previous comment was more about the situation as a whole, having to go that far for something like that is rather ridiculous.
---
I like pulling a lot, sometimes I die for it. Sometimes another player sees this while I die. I never even stop to see if they are of class who could ress me. Didn't cross my mind I could be entitled for his time.
---
Helm and chest are nice, I skipped the rest because I already had scarlet pieces (which drop like candy).
---
True, it can help mitigate some dmg especially with lots of little guys (like scarabs or something in ZF). 
---
But I can confidently say I've never once wiped and thought to myself "damn, if only I had stone skin down I could have kept the tank alive", while I've experienced multiple wipes in dungeons where a runner wasn't slowed and chain pulled other groups
---
This sub is unironically anti-mages, and you're still being downvoted. It's not the idea of some other mage offering free services they're reacting to. It's a non-mage expecting that to be the standard. Entitled and/or tone deaf as fuck, essentially.
---
First of all. Never said it wouldn't have an effekt on Wpvp. I can't argue it wouldn't. And you say I'm wrong... about there still being Wpvp? And then you say it won't be on the same scale... but it would be there. Or you say I'm wrong about you not actually knowing anything which... let's be honest. We are both at best guessing.
---
You are kinda having an arguement with ME that we aren't having.
---
The Wpvp is shit in wow. Because blizz have never tried in any meaningful way to combat the underlaying issue which makes, it shit. And that is server imbalence. And when people start to get hit by it they will transfer or leave, which makes it worse.
---
That is a whole new arguement i started so you don't have to fokus on any of that, but what CAN be fokused on is they can fix the possible shitshow by not following their old format, that they should have learned SOMETHInG from.
---
on Gehennas EU horde life looks like this, 40 Apes vs \~120 horde or more =&gt; every hordie dead pretty fast with almost no losses, you can come and experience this as well LUL
---
Tanking as a shaman feels great, but damn it take so much mana
---
99€ (the CE) + 12.23€ (Shipping), so 112.22€ total
---
I would tend to agree but the felheart set actually is terrible compared to the proper dmg items you need. You lose a shit ton if spellpower. However for pvp felheart set is really good cause of all the primary stats
---
when group start, pm gm or raid lead saying just saying "inv".  
---
Most of the time its first come first serve. If they gonna make you wait for raid 2 when theres barely anyone remaining id just gquit tbh
---
Yeah, I don't think "casual" or "hardcore" have strict definitions but there is absolutely some middle ground.
---
Oh no that’s just my total money right now, but fishing has been quite profitable. I fish up wrecks and pools, and when I wanna just chill I’ll sit with my SO in the barrens and fish for deviates. On my server, a stack of Savory Deviate Delights sells for 1-1.5g! 
---
It took a while to get it up to 100-150 but now I only have to fish for a few moments when I see a pool or wreck for some nice profit.
---
Hey congrats though. I just really want one of them man, the staff though seems a bit more econic but stat-wise I think I prefer sword, but I'll take any of it right now, can't even get my witchblade to drop in scholo, it has been absolutely killin me.
---
Noone likes you, bitch
---
Free beef?
---
Titan panel is correct
---
This isn’t private servers anymore, move on and deal with it
---
BuT eVeRyOnE wIlL qUiT
---
haha yea i'm surprised too.
---
Ahhh. Ok. I'll have to look back into the classes. I liked the class design in that game.
---
Which add-on to do you use to show his name like that ?
---
I'd like to MT though, I've heard this is not as boring as mage or warlock mono-spell rotation
---
Honestly, after seeing how people on this sub react to him.... his community can't be that much worse, but there are some black sheep in every community, especially big ones like his or a wow subreddit
---
I hadn't heard of using hamstring to proc overpower before. Are mobs more likely to dodge a hamstring?
---
On my server I have found they will include it in the LFG post - i.e. "need 2 DPS for BRD, hand of Justice on reserve"
---
Certainly possible, but then the question is how much of a problem is it? Is it a problem for a small minority of people or is it a problem for the majority of people? Because there doesn't seem to be a large contingent of folks complaining, seems to be more the former then the latter.
---
So don't spam after you said NTY. Still makes sense.
---
You can check the fight club tables.  When you fight a mob 3 levels higher than you (raid boss) since their defense is over 10 points higher than your weaponskill they get a natural 3 percent chance to evade your attack.  Skill also increases glancing blow damage, and now you see why going from 300 to 305 weapon skill is so very important to melee dps in raids.
---
As I understand questing at 60 is a great way to make gold, but are the most viable zones for this only EPL/WPL/WS? I've completed Un'goro/WS while leveling, and I believe there's no quests in Silithus aside from a Hydraxian quest area. It seems like I may run out of quests after a good days grind if these are the only options at the moment, so any insight is appreciated.
---
Thanks for the answer. 
---
Though, do you have any source for that? Like.. did blizzard say something about that?
---
Sheesh aggressive
---
They have two things you need to counter: nova and blink. You have to keep intercept to counter their blink. So you need something else to counter nova: I used grenades. Most mages nova as soon as I charge + harmstring, so I throw a grenade. When the stun run out I'm almost out, they blink and I intercept. Then they are dead.
---
It only works vs average skilled mages. A good one will kill you 95% of the time.
---
Paid transfers weren't available in retail vanilla until 3 months after naxx released so I wouldn't get your Hope's up for it to happen anytime soon.
---
The whole point of a deposit is so you don't just dump everything in your inventory into the AH. You actually have to consider what will actually sell for the price you set it at.
---
I don't think playing with a 2h means you have no skill.
---
Some people call me cheap, but there is nothing stopping you from using the pillar or the tunnels in IF.
---
Yeah, after you tried to encourage him to commit a crime. Multiple times.
---
They would be insane not to do the next expansion in mid 2020, then continue with TBC mid 2021, new expanion in 2022, WotLK in 2023. That's a yearly release for the next 4 years in a way that doesn't affect the dev-cycle of retail. Makes too much sense to not do it that way
---
Yea the classic ama.
---
&gt;You have three capitol cities to RP in, so do you really need/want to RP in that one location where everyone is always OOC and spamming?
---
Yes, and what's wrong with that? All you have to do is not engage with them if you don't like it. But we see people going out of their way to ridicule people playing the game a certain way, and the justification is "they shouldn't be doing it here"? That's a case of kicking someone out of their own house. The RP tag says RP, not "RP except for certain areas".
---
I'm not saying people in busy areas should roleplay, and I'm not saying RPers are expected to RP 24/7. What I'm saying is it's awful that people are being bullied out of roleplaying just because they're in a busy area. It literally doesn't affect you, move on.
---
Gottem!
---
Wh... Isn't that the gnome on the island off the coast of Tanaris? Are they long lost friends!?
---
I chose warlock in classic because I used to be a mage from 1-70, raided all of tbc and was tired of the class. Once I started twinking at 49 with an SL/SL lock my love for the class was installed. 
---
Classic warlock isn't *exactly* like that.  But it's different and fun. It's interesting to stack complete shadow wrath gear while leveling. I'm at nearly 200 spell power at 47. I'm literally tanking bosses for these aoe spell cleave groups so they can keep going.    I did respec a garbage build to get the stun/daze aoe setup which was fun but not ideal for questing. 
---
I'm sad that dark pact isn't scaling with spell power in vanilla like tbc but that's ok.  I can't wait to farm for my cat mount as a gnome :) and then support my 49 twink habit.
---
So... you get upset when people are dicks to you after you're dicks to them. Got it. Understandably, someone spamming your chat because they're upset is probably the "greater" of the two evils, but is it *really* that hard to press three buttons and spend maybe 15-30 seconds to switch forms, rez someone and drink? *Really*?
---
No. Fiery, as with most enchants, is based on procs per minute. Wep speed does not mean more procs.
---
more like retail where alliance barely play anymore after all the years of horde favouritism LUL
---
Because any other dps that pulls aoe threat will die immediately, mages have an 85% slow attached to their aoe which gives the tank time to pull off them.  Ideally though you'd give the tank time to get some agro before you start dpsing, druids actually hold groups of 3-4 targets better than warriors in my experience.
---
Weak auras
---
So the voidwalker is stuck in a Nick-at-Nite 1950s hellscape?
---
Which server is that?
---
Life is difficult in my head.
---
Imagine if you could give +1 or -1 karma on people based on recent interactions with them.
---
Skullflame
---
What about M-M-M-M-MORTAL STRIKE!
---
So when phase 2 rolls out, Ony and MC are still the end game, and the new dungeons are just more pre-endgame dungeons?
---
Is this a feminism copypasta?
---
Because I think that's in poor taste.
---
Only doors. Blacksmiths open chests with keys
---
Fiery Weapon is a flat PPM
---
it has its uses tbh. for example, while leveling, if you cleared all the way to an escort quest guy, and someone takes him just as you get there, and its a 15 minute "Respawn". switch a layer or two and you no longer have to sit there forever.
---
the only other case where i've found it useful is when grinding, if the mobs i specifically want are already being over farmed, sometimes switching layers can turn that completely around.
---
sometimes it doesnt work and either both/all are being farmed or the one i switched to was even worse lol
---
regardless i dont care if there are or arent layers, i like it either way, im just saying there are uses that arent exactly "harmful" for layering.
---
[Yup](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/43/40-Year-OldVirginMoviePoster.jpg)
---
Yeah, you have to click the spell and then click the corpse. This is why I keep the spell out on my bars even though I use VuhDo's smart rez. Sometimes ya gotta just rez someone out in the world.
---
3-5 gold there as well.
---
He wasn't talking about me, cupcakekid. Nice try, though.
---
Depends on your server. On my server, basically all the bags you can easily make (as in, you don't need to get a pattern to drop) don't make a profit versus the vendor price. Even runecloth bags on my server are only selling for the cost of the runecloth + threads, so there's no profit to be made.
---
That being said, bags are a pretty easy way to level up for "free". As long as the bag is yellow or orange, you can just stand in a capital city and post messages in trade chat saying you'll make the bags for free with their mats (and then list the mats they need. I usually provide the threads for people and just have them pay the silver so that they don't need to find the tailor supply vendor).
---
I haven't had much luck making money with other good pieces of armor. The dreamweave and shadoweave stuff is super good for caster leveling but my server basically lets me sell each piece for maybe 1-2g over the mat cost and it doesn't move very quickly, so I only make a few gold per week off of that. Biggest seller is the shadoweave mask because you have to do quest in Searing Gorge for the pattern, so fewer tailors are making those compared to the recipes you can just learn from the trainer.
---
I plan on dropping tailoring after I make my priest robes. I just don't see it making that much money in the long run and I really only took it to be able to make bags early on and then make my BIS robes.
---
There is some dynamic spawning in place, but not as vigorously as on private servers.
---
even though french is my first language, i find it hard to play it on that language settings. Mostly part because being on a NA realm most of the pop use the english client and make it weird to communicate with others when items, npc, regions and quest are not the same.  
---
One time i spoke with a guy that played with the french client and told me about his character and itemisation. Felt like I didnt know the game anymore.
---
It IS pretty cool. But I think I will skip this one.
---
thats probably slower gph than actually farming methods as a mage tbh
---
Why would you tell someone to fuck off for being upfront with a fair price?
---
Nah, watch his early videos, he’s always greedy like this, but he did try to have a persona now than before tho
---
That still doesn't mean you want to keep a lvl 11 weapon with fiery for very long. Fiery is like a 4 dps increase.
---
You take a druid out to dinner.
---
Was a pug group not his guild.  His guild raid group is actually pretty legit.
---
No, just bring some mana pots. I carry around some big &amp; expensive ones just in case but mostly use the 700-900 ones you can loot in stratholme boxes. Fire protection pots are also good to have on Rag.
---
Maybe he's someone who can separate entertainment from reality like a normal person. Since when does entertainment need to be something that shows something good that we should teach our youth?
---
I’d echo this point, sounds like they’re leading you on here. Try have an honest chat around your chances of joining raids, if no luck move on, sounds like you deserve better. 
---
From experience if they’ve done it once they will do it again ie if someone else better geared/experienced or with more time comes along
---
No way transmog will get in IMO
---
I'm a 54 Hunter with most in BM and some in MM. Should I be considering respecting to shift balance more toward MM to get more dps and Trueshot? Will my DPS increase offset the drop in my pet's? Will this make solo questing more difficult? For reference my regular group is a Fire Mage, Tank War, Feral Druid, and Elemental Sham.
---
Just because you offer your service for free doesn't mean that a mage does too. If he wants to charge 1g then that's fine. Go find another mage or cough up the cash.
---
I tip rogues half of the item vendor price when they lock pick for me.
---
Laziness hasn't set in yet, give it time.
---
We'll see what happens, but if they make changes just to make Classic+ its own little thing, then it opens an enormous can of worms, especially for the playerbase who is here, because they wanted the experience they had 15 years ago, warts and all.
---
So as for the whole moonkin thing, oh yeah I hear you, no debate there, the oomkin situation. As for feral, heh you can still do respectable damage but you would have to work your backside off to farm all the exact gear you need - just to put out competitive damage vs all the others.
---
I've accepted my fate that I'll either be tanking or healing as a druid. That's fine.
---
You think that but you'll win pvp fights over that cooldown.
---
I wouldn't bother with it after level 30 though.
---
Since we are only in phase one and phase 2-3 are an unknown time away from now, it’s probably best to avoid the whole twink investment. I would guess there are a bunch of people holding on to these items and IF twinking becomes a thing in the future, there is going to be a large supply of these items going up on the AH. Probably won’t make enough profit to justify waiting so long. 
---
I have a lvl 29 twink weapon that I can’t even sell on the AH for 5 gold btw. Probably the best one hand sword for that level and I just want to get rid of it lol
---
Exactly, he's being a rank 1 paladin, while getting gear funneled to him and still, he's being absolutely shat on in terms of dps by rogues/warriors who perform like shit.
---
lvl 44 out-damages lvl 38 and 33... and boasts about it?
---
Where are you making 120g/hr?
---
I appreciate the input, but there's really no need. I'm familiar enough with the virtues of various skills, I just don't want to level cooking or fishing on my warrior right now.
---
I think a good mix of both is probably a good balance between having fun and leveling fast
---
It's just an ogre with a wig.
---
Agree.  Troll on Horde side for sure.  Dwarf on alliance side... Unless you want to be a jerk with MCing, then Night Elf.
---
anyone know the addon he uses?
---
You didn't owe us this post either :) but thanks though
---
I migrated my alliance character. Only ever played Alliance :D population seems pretty balanced
---
Barely level 34 on my Orc Shaman main, and i'm already tempted to get side-tracked and start twinking. Also, I love the Shrek name reference!
---
Kind of crappy explorers if you ask me, then.  No wonder they always need your help for things.
---
If you feel like playing a melee hunter. That's what Slam is for.
---
Guessing alliance from flair? That explains it. Horde have it super easy for SM if you sit outside the entrance or in UC you instantly find groups. Even as a DPS it only took me less than a minute to find a new group so there is zero downtime. Where is the nearest alliance town even at?
---
Yeah! Get em!
---
I'm also in Blaumex as well... on the Horde side that is as a troll shaman named Mojohexual :D
---
Do you need anything from tailoring right now? If not why not check a guide for what you need when leveling tailoring, save up the cloth in your bank or on an alt. Keep skinning and herb (I would replace skinning btw) and make some extra money that you can use to boost your tailoring when you need it.
---
Pretty friggen good
---
They’re basically selling sth, and if someone is willing to pay the price (no chance at rolling for the orbs) they join and by that they buy sth,
---
Personally I’d prolly be okay with giving up a 1 in 5  chance for some orb to save 1-2 hours searching for a group
---
I’ve had something similar happen when I summoned my hunter pet. Just before I died in a PvP battle, it was feared. When I resurrected and summoned my pet it still had fear!
---
Hi, /u/holyrasta

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dd8xqa/hey_i_need_a_soul_to_get_my_subscription_for_me_i/). 
---
So why not just spec for healing for the dungeon grind if that is the end goal anyway?  Dont you think you would piss of your dungeon group's healer by rolling against him on his gear? As a priest you are much more useful to a dungeon group as a designated healer than you are a smite bot.  It just doesnt make any sense to me.
---
Those are surprisingly good gloves, didn't know about those. 
---
Right now I've just got a chain on my dungeon weapon, but yeah those gloves sound like a much cheaper alternative. The weapon chain plans are pretty expensive due to the rarity, so it can be hard both finding the plans and finding a blacksmith who can make them.
---
&gt;I was also curious if anyone had a place they would recommend for farming gold.
---
The warrior quest to get their level 40 axe requires 8 drops from each of three different elementals in arathi highlands. These drops are only found in 3 distinct spots, and they're not super common but not rare either. (Maybe 20% drop rate) The drop gotten from the storm elementals (Thundering charm) is worth about 50s per drop on my realm, and they seem to _always_ sell. If you get on off-peak times and are able to farm for an hour or two, you should be able to make 20-30g.
---
Yeah, luckily I haven't encountered a good mage so far.
---
There is literally one piece from T1 that is in resto druid bis list  (boots). So yeah I'd say in the end T1 for druid is pretty trash no matter what is your spec.
---
it's because it wouldn't stop. the 1% crazy nolifers out there NEVER have enough content. They will speed clear ANYTHING blizzard has to offer them. If wow classic had been ALL pre-BC content from day 1, you would already have servers with AQ gates opened and all content cleared, that's how things goes. And those same people screaming today for P2 and P3 to come faster, would instead be screaming for BC to release "TODAY !! or else we quit"
---
Tha'ts what fucked wow in the first place, the fact that each new content was always aimed at the 1% of players who could actually access it, leaving out the other 99%
---
I mean there are a lot of 1.5 second cast spells in the game:
---
1. Polymorph
---
2. Fear
---
3. Scare beast
---
4. Entangling roots
---
5. Most fast heals
---
etc
---
Definitely far from useless.
---
I wouldn't, and I imagine plenty of others would either. Not everyone is an airhead my guy.
---
Imagine people suggesting dropping friends over a 2 liner story. That would be quite retarded.
---
tank dungeons a lot until u adquire all your prebis then .....SM spam , solo that place until you eyes bleed , each run should be about 15gs , is not much per hour compared to ... well huntards/mages but you are a warrior , you tanked a horrible leveling process to 60, so you patience is off the charts, eventually you will get there. 
---
do not, DO NOT spend money on anithing else than a weapon upgrade . even then while that arcanite reaper may seem juicy , a dread forge retaliator/doomsaw/tweak of world tree (this 1 is super cheap on AH) will do the trick.
---
To me pvp is the end game, so axe specialization is nice, but not the dream.  Being able to resist HoJ, Charge, intercept, pounce, black out, improved concussive shot, mace stuns, cheap shot, kidney shot five times more than other players is the reason to pick an orc.  
---
I would roll both to level 16 through a run of rfc and see which animations you like better.  Really pay attention to how your character runs, blocks, dodges, attacks, parries instead of focusing on questing.  You are playing to determine if the animations are what you like to put days of play time into this character.
---
The portal costs the mage 20s to cast and gives no benefit to them. Lockpicking is free for the rogue, and gives the rogue a benefit (by leveling lockpicking).
---
Comparing the 2 is dumb.
---
How does the alt loot it? The main has to full clear VC?
---
No point really downranking with no +healing.  Just try to stay in the 5s mana regen between casts if you can.
---
If I were a warlock IRL I think I would stop adventuring and just have a succubus as a sex slave.
---
Just don’t assume a mage in a capital ‘is doing nothing’. Time is money.
---
Do people usually tip lower level enchantments? I mean I have to do them anyways in order to skill the profession but others still get value out of them...
---
Bald man sad
---
Yea once you hit 58 you can get a lot of dungeon quests in scholo and strat. A full quest run of both will get you like 1.5 levels.
---
ALRIGHT TIME'S UP, LET'S DO THIS!!!
---
No, you were correct.  Who cares about a stupid orange vanity weapon anyway?
---
Denying a group a core utility your class offers because you don't want to or because you want money for it is nothing but selfish. Yes, it's their choice whether or not they're an asshole, but it's also my choice to not group with them in the future. I think you should reread my initial comment to which you replied with "enough with the gimme gimme" when you're saying I'm making threats that hinder the group. 
---
Additionally how are you needing 100-200 heals a run as a dps? Maybe watch your aggro. The amount of damage a dps should take in most dungeons should be easily manageable with bandages except for the rare fights with aoe damage, which you can live through with a pot if you're doing it correctly. So a run with no heals on dps should maybe take two stacks of bandages and a potion for a dps, which get this, costs about the same as the water a for a healer in a run if they buy it from the vendor. Moreover, one dps dying will almost never wipe a group, so the hole point is vacuous. It would just add a few minutes to the run from their dying a few times and give them a repair bill that about equals how much a healer spends on water if they buy it from the vendor. (both instances give an about equivalent opportunity cost to not getting mage water).
---
Which class are you playing? In populated servers you can even pug the raids. Some guilds do pug runs, like they have only 20 people online, and they invite a bunch of randoms as well.
---
I did MC and Onyxia when I was 12 several times, while does not even having proper english skills, so I had no idea what I was doing.
---
Oh yeah, that shit is disabled. Essentially I hold the left mouse to move the camera to my desired location, and either leave it so that I can use the mouse to click buttons on the side bar (where I keep potions and things), or continue to hold it so I can scan the area. All the while I'm running either on auto-run or by holding W. I steer with the keyboard or strafe as necessary. More often I steer for precision direction.
---
With Dominos, you right click on the bar you want to modify, then go to the paging dropdown or tab and for each form you can choose which action bar you want it to swap to.
---
Dear fucking diary
---
Idk but I get asked to port between the two cities all the time
---
If I want to help someone and if I want to do something helpful with my time I want to fully decide myself who to help! I’ m so fed up of all the cluttering whispers I get all the time I’ m at the bank or AH...
---
Even as a 10/10 and 1/1'er I am quite happy if they slow this shit down
---
Relaunching Classic is a once-in a lifetime thing.......why rush it?
---
This is kind of the point I'm making. It's a service that people tip for. You should pay your 20s minimum plus a tip, but to reply with "1g" like you're owed it is absurd. I can find another mage in 5 seconds that would gladly take anything I gave him and doesnt have to ask me for an inflated tip. I tip 1g because I want to and it's a nice thing to do for a service being provided.
---
I uses to work for tips, it's not like I'm saying this because I'm cheap. I tip well above average for most services. But you say nothing but "1g" and you come off as an entitled ass like you're owed it.
---
Upvote for clappin' cheeks.
---
Oof... groups like this are pushing me farther from the group aspect of the game. I do think you should have not wiped them tho, but not for their benefit. Cath done rrreeeaally slow like they are inevitably going to try and do results in rolling respawns that make finishing impossible and or disgustingly time consuming until they give up. It's a worse hell.
---
Yet :P
---
&gt; is for closed groups of players
---
Our RP PVP server was supposed to be our closed group mate. Thats what you just fail to understand.
---
Perhaps not the way this guild is doing it, but a second raid group makes a ton of sense. A 40 raid with 5-10 stragglers is way overkill for MC, whereas 2x25 raids would probably get 1.5x the gear AND guarantee new recruit spots. MC is not hard enough to warrant all 40.
---
Little less, but that's my spot.
---
I’ve tried to get better at PvP. I’ve done 2s and 3s and bgs. I leveled a few toons on a PvP realm. It’s just not for me. I play to relax and I don’t find it relaxing most of the time.
---
&gt; Casual players want to be catered to
---
&gt; Blizzard caters to them
---
well of course they will, "casuals" by your definition are 99% of the subscribers. Look in the mirror and realize you are the problem
---
Somehow, I was under the impression, one choice would replace the other... Thanks for the info.
---
I generally don't like people that promote ninjalooting and generally screwing people over. Does that somehow make me jealous of him too?
---
Yeah but if you're standing in ironforge or another city doing nothing. You're not deciding whether to continue farming 200g/hr or make some stacks of food and water for 2g.
---
Your options are 2g or 0g.
---
I mean not really. Like yes because you wear plate and have good hp but your CC has a long CD and you have no dmg so its only useful in 1 position. 
---
“You are the only one defending the base and your team is rushing to help you before you die but they are to far away to help, making it a race. 
---
You’ll last longer giving reinforcements time to reach the base. But even that is minimal.
---
3 builds for 2h weapons:  
---
**Fury Slam** (needs a lot of Rage because you still want to be using BT and WW on cd, which is hard when you are also slamming).
---
**Fury without Slam** (less Rage needed, but you mostly waste the rage after BT and WW).
---
**Arms** (Mortal Strike is required and it takes an important debuff slot in raids...so this spec is generally discouraged)
---
I think it depends on your level too. Level 54 tank may have issues with some of the harder five pulls. Level 60 should be able to do it. Question though. Why do people say two hander instead of 2 weapon. Is a two hander somehow better for tanking ?
---
The minmax question of all companies: how do you cheap out without getting a bad rap?  
---
Especially in p2 with world bosses and honor, if videos keep coming out that show shitty server performance, Classic will look bad. Blizzard cares about this, unquestionably. The only question is whether they think it'll be a big enough deal to invest $ in.
---
They want to be pedantic for no reason.
---
It’s pretty good starter tank weapon doesn’t proc enough imo but it’s the best I’ve got.
---
I see, you are a man of culture aswell.
---
&gt; 100 / 7 = ~14 gold per day, every day to get the 100 gold needed for 2 respecs per week.
---
And you only raid once every 2 weeks....
---
Figured it would still be an issue. Thanks for confirming. I’ll just leave them as is and continue to /reload each time I log in.
---
As a rogue with LW I always inspect their gear and give any upgrades I can, especially if I’ve made a lot of gear to level up.
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
---
\*Murloc reduces your chance to hit by 50%
---
# ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY!!
---
Not really. It takes three seconds to cast, times 10 at most for a full stack, plus a little bit of time to drink yourself if you need to up mana, all they're asking for is for them to give you a minute or two of your time so you can get what you want. That's not a lot at all.
---
so your counter is anecdotes?
---
I would suggest talking in guild chat more and getting to know some of the people in your guild. It will get you invited to runs more often, which will make gearing a lot easier. A microphone is usually not required, as 40 people can't all talk at once anyway.
---
Don't worry about it too much. Try to get to know your guild a bit better, make it clear you are a noob, and they will probably help you along and invite you to things to get experience and gear and improve.
---
I get what you’re saying. Things had been going very well up until now, I finished every dungeon to my level accordingly and was a bit astonished that it all went so well, hardly any deaths or wipes, except way early when I was blamed once and questioned once in sfk. I hope I will keep an adequate level in groups to come, I get advice from my guild. Except for this one experience I’ve really enjoyed the game as a community driven experience, would’ve loved to make some more friends but it usually stops after each completed quest. What is difficult, being new, is discerning like in this case whether it’s actually poor play by me or the group leader who did pulls like he did. I also get that the point of such groups is excactly speed and time, I didn’t think of that beforehand. Some criticism I’ll gladly work on, anything to improve my skills, but I did feel I got a lot uneccessary thrash.
---
Forgot BWL.
---
get some friends
---
I'm with you. At least you don't have to worry about faction imbalances making queues longer this time.
---
Friends dont act selfish and entitled when someone is doing them a favour.
---
What he has are toxic users and you know im right.
---
As does being a hunter.
---
Praise be to Chestnutz
---
Has nothing to do with being an airhead. Has everything to do with being financially set for life by doing something stupid in a meaningless video game.
---
Okay, so the portal could be 20s. That's perfectly fair. 
---
I've maxed lockpicking. There's no benefit other than helping others.
---
Without engineering you don't stand a chance and even with it you have to time your items right. Mostly just avoid mages if possible.
---
Except they are. They are working on a level squish down to 60, bringing back talent trees, and more in depth itemization. Its absolutely undeniable that they are trying to bring elements of classic to retail. Ian even said so in multiple Q&amp;A sessions. If you dont want that, that's fine but you can't deny they are doing it
---
I think it’s fair to ask for a tip since you’re providing a service. The few times I’ve gotten lower level enchants offered for free I tipped anyways though. So either or, but if you’re just trying to level the profession I would offer for free and hope people tip but your results may vary.
---
It's mostly a PVP weapon, there's no reason to hand it to warriors over paladins and shamans. And if the paladins or shamans are actually dps in your raid, it's also a PVE upgrade for them so even more reason.
---
I think it’s because it’s Uld. Super out of the way dungeon for horde, and super long, and they don’t even have a tank yet.
---
I feel like at this point you're just arguing because I'm not doing it your way.
---
What I do and how I do it have served me well since the original release of the game. I've made it efficient for how I play and attempting to learn a new playstyle would only hinder the experience.
---
Play how you want to play. That's all there is to it. What works for one my not seem efficient to another, and vice versa.
---
My holy paladin got asked to tank a lot. The problem is that all my points are literally holy-centric, and people don't understand how weak of a tank I am. I did a few at low levels but even BFD was painful as hell. I do hardly any damage, so even consecration is worthless.
---
I wish people would whisper me to heal, though. Lol.
---
Arguing morals in a virtual game? Lmfaoooo
---
Go outside.
---
The other guy who had the same issue showed them passport stamps and travel tickets and they still told him to fuck off, so what makes you think that it would work any better for the OP unless he posts here?
---
Tank here, same. And I'm never even offered a dime for my services. Meanwhile mages grab a reagent and press a button and boom, people hand over gold? Sigh.
---
Unreal Tournament is hilarious in French.  Especially in the double, triple and quadrouple kills.
---
that sir is not really true. mobs of you same level will kick your teeth even if kiting with hamstring (wich is severly handicaped in classic compared to PS, mobs will hit you from another galaxy ) ideally a warrior must be killing mobs 2 levels under.  the truth is warrior suck at leveling and that statement comes from a comparisson with other classes not itself. so compared to OTHER CLASSES , you suck at leveling. 
---
the ww axe gives the false perception of easy kills , well is designed to be a level 44+ weapon , so when you use it to kill 30s seems op, but around that number 44 or less... you will see lagging again ...
---
I think it depends on how you play. Many average players will play solo a lot or just with a friend or two.
---
You won't be layered that much, if at all.
---
Compare that to a streamer who's constantly hopping in and out of groups and actually wants layering bugs so they can bitch and moan for another 5 mins
---
Ugh I wish!!!! Maybe if I moved quicker I couldve shot him but I tried and said he wasnt in sight and then out of range. You can see the error messages on vid
---
Four months is way way too short. No amount of time delay will "kill off so many guilds". The people who are already raiding Ony/MC literally do not matter. They will resub and come back for Classic whenever a new raid comes out, even if it's 2 or 3 years from now.
---
Releasing phase 2 so quickly sets a terrible precedence. I don't want a 2 year life span for this game. It took 100 days for people to clear Molten Core originally. I would want phase 1 to last a minimum of 6 months.
---
Right now, the servers are still in Retail mentality. You have people churning through content and already in the "log on for raids" mentality. Classic servers should be given time to develop. Communities grow over time and servers get unique identities. I just can't understand why anybody is in a rush to be done with Classic after waiting 15 years.
---
Damn it Wendy!!! Bring back my Spicy Bacon-nator I need my spicy fat boy tummy to be filled.
---
I have both and honestly I still think the WW axe gets the slight nod because of the stats, although I do use ravager while questing
---
Wait until you find out how much it costs Dasani to bottle some water!
---
Summoned With Children
---
Level ~42-44 is roughly the half way point for most people playtime wise when leveling to 60. You could still realistically hit 60 before phase 2 without having to really rush. Also, as far as I’m aware it’s not like blizzard is rushing out phase 2 because people hit 60 and cleared MC faster than expected, they likely have had a late 2019 release planned for phase 2 since before launch. Releasing late 2019 will be fairly on track with when phase 2 released in actual vanilla.
---
My dude, the answer is SM GY if you're a mage and you need that money ASAP. If I were you, I'd wait until I was level 40, and Just go in there and solo AOE grind until you hit 90g. You will need a full AOE grinding spec, and know how to ping pull + blizzard kite. 
---
You can repeat this technique  in ZF to pay for your epic mount at 60 in about 10-18 hours depending on big ticket BOE blues, so it will pay off to get good at solo AOE grinding.
---
Don’t use rain of fire. The damage is mediocre at low levels and you waste mana. Stick to DOTS and auto attacks with wands. That’s all the damage you need.
---
Warrior is literally the #1 dps in the game
---
Funny how the owner is named "Reddit". As if this was posted specifically to be posted as a screenshot on Reddit.
---
It’s a persona he puts on. Not a likable or fun to watch persona imo, but he does it for the pageantry.
---
You must have insane gear to be able to hit and crit enough to make this fury prot work.  Shoot you even are not picking up 10 defensive skill.  I bet you are in full epics already with this build.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ0HrEklWjI
---
Curses debuff targets, and in doing so buff your friends.
---
Its their guild name...
---
Warrior is not viable. You only autoattack and hope for proccs.
---
Ret ist the only viable plate DPS
---
He could be a warrior with high first aid skill.
---
Well a few of our members that rushed to lvl 60 left the guild to join a raiding guild (our guild is smaller and more casual) so wanted to see if any of these were them.
---
Sorry, yeah that was the "offtanking" (as in, on a target that is not being actively focused right away) build.  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/053050013520105001-05-500500104  
---
Is a bit better for 5s
---
This was my first encounter, if I ever have that gut feeling again I'm just fucking leaving.
---
Exactly. Thank you.
---
And why has that been the suggested leveling spec? Because no one does the math and just repeats what everyone else is saying.
---
If you do the math and look at the numbers you realize that Disc has several benefits over Shadow while having about the same dps. In conclusion: there is no reason to spec Shadow unless you want to.
---
If you are getting kited by locks/hunters you are doing it wrong
---
Okay
---
I'm actually glad there's going to be a world pvp phase with no bgs. I've been playing wsg for over a decade... I'm sick of it tbh. This phase is going to let us experience something that only happened once in the game's history.
---
Clearly I got to you in one of my comments since you freaked out with extra responses twice, I'm going to take the pity route and leave you be, good luck pal.
---
:(
---
Just drink til you are ready.  It'll only take a wipe or two til the tank slows down.  Water is too expensive to waste it on 5 seconds drinking unless you have a mage.
---
Sure. Just dont try to present it as just as effective because it isnt.
---
Damn, she's a keeper bro
---
What chat Addon is that?
---
You don't get an excuse, you get a chance to apologize. 
---
How weird and strange your world view is that violence and arrest is what came to mind.
---
Its content. Stop crying for alliance
---
Google is your friend here. There are already great guides for warrior stance macros
---
But to answer one of your questions: there is a macro button on the escape menu, or by writing /macro. Nearly all commands can be shortened as long as they stay unique so /m will also do the trick
---
It's more about bring frightened into distraction, and I didn't make the stickers lol, I just googled their purpose and this was one of the listed reasons.
---
he just hovered over and pasted it ontop
---
Alli quests there are generally higher level than the first horde quests, so if you go there right after silverpine you probably are target #1 for alli that just got ganked by higher level horde going to the ruins in alterac or stuff in western arathi.  
---
Both sides will call in friends to counter gank uneven pvp situations/camping, but UC is closest major city so it's easier/more common for horde to be around.  
---
The area seems designed to create a higher level alli/small group of mid level alli vs. hordes of low level undead situation though.
---
This is a very succinct way of describing how it has been for me so far.  I warn people in advance "first time tanking this one, so i'll probably mismark, go the wrong direction, or otherwise screw up a pull or two".  People have been pretty forgiving.
---
God help anyone who joins me for my first BRD run as a tank.  I feel bad for them.
---
The heal amount seems pretty abysmal, and it's not an instant heal either, it's over time, doesn't seem really worth it unless I'm missing something
---
Had our guild name changed, it wasn't even a violation. Some other guild/group must have mass reported it as they overturned it.
---
Honestly, RP servers are just a place for people to grief using the report system. If your enjoyment of the game is dependant on another person's NAME, well sounds like you need a new hobby.
---
Just make sure they know you're going to use AOE's in groups of trash mobs 3 or more. Sometimes tanks just ask to DOT them and not pull aggro off them. 
---
Just communicate with your group :)
---
Offhand speed only matters once you get poisons at 20. A lvl 11 weapon, even with fiery, will be replaced by then.
---
I'm sure you can, but all my groups have had tanks. I think it's more fun to act like there's cohesion and roles rather than everyone blowing shit up and a healer playing whackamole
---
Kromcrush gang represent.
---
Mind linking the addon that does that ?
---
I would say check your server's AH and decide from there. On my server I've made a nice bit of profit from Alchemy, especially mana potions.
---
I guess that’s considered toxic I don’t know, I’m old and don’t keep up with the constantly changing social tags. 
---
What I do know is that there are a lot of players that think they are a lot better at playing than they really are. You found an entire group of them.
---
Me too. He was civil and answered the question. I threw him an upvote, but he's still so negative. I think people are just envious his friend has millions of dollars. Petty people will be petty.
---
If the goal was to clear faster you'd probably want to rush complete sets first, but not everybody would be happy with that ofc.
---
I've sold characters on Private servers for more. Had Thunderfury on LH and sold that character for nearly a grand.
---
The Meta macro would be a macro that opens the macro menu
---
And only use it if you don't have windfury or are taking damage.
---
Positive, thought this was the case too and tried to turn it in so I just abandoned it after I couldn't
---
I only tanked in classic and Legion/bfa so there's that. But... In classic, there are no different routes, no mythic plus where you're under time pressure and have to know details of specific mobs given certain affix combinations. In raids, it's also a lot more binary. If you have enough gear to survive the encounter, you probably will, at best you have to taunt swap once or twice since there's barely any real active mitigation you could use in case some kind of stronger attack will hit you.
---
Threat management is also partially duty of dps players, they need to know how much damage they can and should do and which target to attack or not. There's a reason dps players get blamed for overaggroing when they die, not the tank.
---
So it's not about being terrible then lol, it's now about relaxing.
---
I absolutely do, it seems you can't think past surface-level but like I said,  
---
to each their own.
---
Dude I’m not 60 I don’t even have a sub how many times do I have to say it. How am I missevaluating myself. I’m not even playing holy fucking shit.
---
You did insult me. You told me I didn’t have a job.
---
I'm level 60 with 100g. But I did make my Truefaith vestments as they were 100x more important. This weekend I'll run mara solo, farm a bunch of gold.  I figured it to be about 25 hours of work farming roughly 40g an hour, probably less with the ghost mushrooms that sell for 1g each and theirs about 10 each instance.
---
Yep. Sounds like OP's ego got triggered with all this shadow priest talk. He had to *prove us wrong with his spreadsheets*.
---
Just a small comment wrt the Crescent Staff: if you can grab the Living Root staff in WC, you can take Wingblade for tanking instead. Living Root hits surprisingly hard.
---
I did the helm quest. Got the helm. It's not as good as the helm I already have.
---
Thanks for answering, but can you explain how was I blown up when there was no magic user within 15 yards?
---
there's quite a few weapon upgrades you could pick up, but gatorbite axe is solid and has a reasonable drop rate so I'd probably try to get that.
---
If we are talking ports people should tip 100% of the time. I forget the exact price but the reagents are 20 something silver. If you aren't giving at least that to a mage for a port I would just not give them a port lol.
---
Scourge invasion was in Warcraft 3, before WoW.
---
No, I'm not comparing multi boxing to fascism. 
---
None of these things are untrue, I've lived it.
---
&gt; Is it my fault for using that spell
---
Yes, sorry to say.  At the best of times, tanks are more concerned with threat output than survival, especially at level 20.  
---
What you NEED to do is to just wait.  Watch how the tank cycles through targets and wait for him to stack his sunders before opening up.  He can't gain aggro without rage, which he gets from being hit, so if you pull aggro he's up shit creek without a paddle.
---
Ask for raid marks, it makes everyone's lives easier because the tank knows exactly who everyone will be attacking, and therefore who to concentrate on.  
---
If you can, install a threat meter.  Everyone used Omen back in the day, I don't know what's popular now.  What people have forgotten is that managing threat is the DPS's job, not the tanks.  It's on YOU to throttle yourself when you get in danger of pulling.  It may seem like your DPS is much lower because of it, but it makes for a faster, smoother run when you aren't causing wipes and undue stress to the tank and healer.
---
Yup. Im 42 and pretty casual. When I think about all the stuff I want to do, 4 months per phase seems short. But I wonder what will happen at the end.
---
Beyond sexy
---
Thank you! What does the first line mean/do? Is it just a comment or does it have a function?
---
Ok so then I will run this macro and I can put a battle stance icon on my action bar to go back. Then do the same thing with berserker:-)
---
I love Sarkath. And even though I have visited him in awhile, I still love Thokkrash on my first warlock.
---
Yep. It’s clear they are just picking and choosing shit that’s easy for them to do instead of providing the authentic experience
---
Ugh....thats what i said....i had 90g and thought i needed only friendly then i had to sell like 400 cloth and every mining and engi mats to get 10g, after my mount i had 0 item in bank and in bags and 7 silver left lol...now at 90silver
---
This originally wasn't an Inn at all, so that is likely why it has poor Inn detection design. Thus having to run upstairs or get on hammocks.
---
And some trash greens to sell!
---
To me it's more effective. There's no "one right way" to play this game, so your arrogance in believing that what I'm doing isn't efficient can take a rest.
---
Thats actually really ducking smart.  I just do not want to miss out on ony and mc any longer
---
It is.
---
They've never said that.
---
You don't know that.
---
Yes. Also correct. Because I'm not being a piece of shit and you're encouraging everyone to be a piece of shit.

I think the fact that I think stealing is wrong, in a game or not would probably mean that I do "go outside" because I'm very aware of how people react to being stolen from. Making other people feel terrible because you want to get a leg up in a video game is an awful thing to do. Airheaded infact.

my friends always made fun of me for playing bots (I had around 400+ games vs them) because I really enjoyed the gameplay.

I think they may be skeptical about putting huge investments into the game as most of it's playerbase will likely leave. Hence the low ammnt of servers, and lower quality network.

You can buy any number of an item (up to the max stack) from a vendor, no matter if they are sold in substacks (stacks of 5 in this case).  Need to use the API, though.

You will never hit "good" DPS only anything but bosses because the fights don't last long enough for your curse sustained damage to really ramp up.
---
Protip though, picking your targets and not being stupid while doing ok enough damage will net you farm more positive interactions than having top DPS.

The very first quest in the chain that leads up to BA starts at 20. The Brutal Armor quest is a level 30 quest, that requires you do level 25-30 stuff (level 25-30 zones, level 25-30 mobs, and a level 30+ dungeon). "Horde [30] Brutal Armor"
---
How can you say: 
---
&gt; If you did everything in your early/mid 20s the gear would have been upgrades for sure.
---
And then admit:
---
&gt; The problem with it, is the gear is stated like you are getting it sooner than is realistically possible.
---
And even if you expect a warrior to get help so he can do it earlier than "is realistically possible", how is it ridiculous for a player to expect that a "[30]" quest would give gear useful at [30]?
---
You don't speak for me. Besides, this is /r/WoW, not /r/worldnews. Even *if* OP made it up, who cares?
---
Try to get some + shadow damage gear, at least for dungeon runs, it helps a lot.
---
He's a dirty horde, they do not know the meaning of true honour!
---
To my understanding, Warlock is a late bloomer. It can be solid DPS at cap, but it won't really shine until they gear in Naxx. As to my understanding, Warlocks scale incredibly well! Whilst some other classes start better as fresh 60s, but by Naxx will fall short.
---
I never even mentioned arrest. Apologies don't suddenly wipe a slate completely clean. Should you apologize? Yes. Does that mean everything is sunshine and roses? No. 
---
At this point you're either a troll or you don't understand how to socialize. Like even on a basic level.
---
A whole assload of people still aren't 60. A lot of people don't even have their mount yet. Gold inflation hasn't happened and probably wont happen at least until phase 2 where raids are introduced that actually need good pots/flasks to get burned, and ingredients be purchased.

For fun, what are the dire consequences of accepting a random friend request?

1g covers 5 portals. I've tipped as high as 5g for a portal. That's 25 portals covered. Let's not pretend here like mages are going broke making portals for people. Every other mage I see already has an epic mount.

Pretty imperfect analogy. They aren't paying for the hours played, they're paying to skip the grind of 1-52. If it was going to take them 8 days played to go 1-52, they weigh the cost of that time spent grinding against the value of paying to skip it.

Someone might pay you for that memory card if you're up to the final boss of multiple games and all they want to do is beat some final bosses without going through the entirety of the game.

Time is money.
---
I know that, but a living tank is better than a dead one. In emergencies, so not at the beginning of the fight, it can still be a good choice. A live tank with less rage is still better than a dead tank
---
I mean, if people don't want to keep dying and losing gold in dungeons they should 100% adapt to the tank for sure. All I want to make clear here is that **it is possible to build better threat**, even though it is not by intuitive means :) I pity the DPS who refuse to change their ways in your groups haha!

You already cared enough to comment

Most mages can make at least 50g/hr, a portal costs them like 30 seconds, more if they have to wait for you, plus the reagent cost is around 75s in straight up potential cash loss. 1g is completely fair for a portal.

I always saw it as people who were too bad to PvP in equal footing against other level 60s made twinks do they could one hit new players.

Don't think it's going to work this time around, low levels most likely won't join bgs and it'll be dead or just the same twinks playing against each other.

Did he every play on a RP server in Retail?  I played Wrath and Cata on a RP-PVP realm and I can guarantee you that not only was RP rare, most players didn't give a bucket of warm saliva for being 'in character'.  You want RP, you make it happen.  The designation was never "RP or GTFO".   It is "RP is more likely here, come gather, ye actors and thespians"
---
Not if you have to walk there and haven’t got a mount yet.

Probably Blizz has a lot more realms per physical server so it's easier to overload

Nope. Best place to do tube quest is where warrior quest mob is for berserk stance. Right after you cross the vine bridge to the section that npc is. You can spam every tube in that one spot.

The “pre bis” is your bis. You need to farm it to be a top fury war. Be happy you can farm it instead of rolling vs 13 other mages in mc for a ring. It takes time but the best fury warriors have it all
---
Mind flay LOL
---
Yeah “great comment”
---
Mages are top AoE DPS.
---
Rogues are top Single Target DPS.
---
Warlocks are 2nd highest AoE DPS with a splash of single target DPS.
---
Hunters are 2nd highest single target DPS with a splash of AoE DPS.
---
So as a hunter I'm always at the top if the dungeon is a mix of single target mobs and groups of mobs.
---
If the dungeon is mostly single target, then rogues will be at the top. I'd it's mostly groups of mobs then the mage will be at the top.
---
Most of your DPS will come from your AoE fire storm when groups of 4+ mobs are pulled.
---
Relevant to damage charts, they do mean something in my opinion. If you are within 30k of the top DPS, then you're fine. If you're over 50k away from top DPS then you need to play harder.
---
One thing that will 100% fuck your DPS up is being out of Mana. If you're running with a bunch of melees, they will not stop and allow you to rest your Mana back so your overall DPS will suck.  But if you have full Mana at the start of every fight you should be in that 30k range.
---
End game dungeon:
---
Nobody is looking for a Hunter or a Warlock. It's easier for hunters to get groups than warlocks and trust me as a hunter, it's not easy getting a group. 
---
Healers don't want Warlock to heal warlocks tbh. &amp; People don't like grouping with hunters because 95% of them are fucking horrible. Every time I group with a hunter I'm like, "morons like this is why I can't get a group..."
---
There are warlocks and hunters that can 99% of the time out DPS mages and rogues in almost any scenario. Those people know their class.
---
Warlocks don't shine through their DPS, they never will. They shine through the utility they bring to a group. They can hand out free heal pots, they can "battle-rez" the healer,  they can summon people, they can crowd-control with banish, fear and Succubus, and they can replenish their mana bar to throw that extra spell to prevent a wipe. And that's just the basics.
---
The instability exists on retail and it existed with more layers. The shitty networking is part of the game now. It has nothing to do with layers.
---
It's an inherent problem with the game, it affects all servers.
---
Good call, I'll try that on an alt sometime
---
I'm looking for a little change of pace from my Druid. Healing's something i knew i'd be maining in classic since it was announced, so Priest and Shaman are looking to be my likely alt options.      
---
I know that both are well represented in Raids. So i'm not worried about viability. But... one of the things i enjoy most is just zoning out and grinding... both for leveling and to make gold. As dumb as it sounds that's honestly going to help me decide which to choose as an alt. How do Priests and Shaman fare when it comes to this? How do the mechanics of solo gold farming look on either spec?         
---
Oh yeah that was the best. Ut2004? I remember getting fragged by bots and hearing them shout "ENFLURE!" . good times

You need to /sit, then go through his dialogue
---
You still get spirit tap as a leveling disc/holy priest. I have no idea why people keep thinking otherwise.

But yes, on a PvP server, shadow is required. On PvE, it's a lot more equal.
---
lol what the fuck are you trying to say? You may just wanna try that whole paragraph over again

This has always severely bothered me. I don't understand how money can't solve these problems. I really don't. I work in IT but I'm not admin or even engineer level so someone smarter than me is more than welcome to explain why I'm wrong.

It’s been a lot of fun over the last couple of months to dive into the development of WoW Classic with the team, while trying to answer some of the many questions that have been posed here and elsewhere. Looking at the plans for a phased content release, unlocking dungeons and raids, and unlocking other systems, it’s clear that the aim is to create a progression experience that resembles the original arc from when WoW first launched. In thinking about what belongs in each of those phases, the team’s focus has always been on rewards.
---
Developers have scoured through vendor lists and treasure tables for items that were added in patches, and then attached them to the staged content unlock plan. This means that if a new item was originally added to a dungeon boss’s loot table with Ahn’Qiraj, you shouldn’t expect it to appear in WoW Classic until Phase 5, which is the phase that contains Ahn’Qiraj content.
---
Along the way, we’ve seen many questions asking if we’re also retracing the steps of incremental changes to individual items and their stats that may have occurred throughout original WoW. Such a plan could be called “progressive itemization.”
---
Here’s an example of progressive itemization. The Tier 2 warrior Helm of Wrath originally had Spirit and Agility on it, as well as critical strike chance. In Patch 1.5.0, the helm’s stat budget was changed to Stamina, Strength, and Defense, along with elemental resistances. Then in Patch 1.7.0, the amount of Defense on the helm was reduced. In Patch 1.8.0, the 5-piece set bonus that included the helm was fixed to work with Whirlwind, and in 1.9.0, it got a better look with an art update.
---
WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item, as it existed in our reference version: 1.12.
---
Of course, this raises the question “why?”. Why differentiate between adding new items along the way and making modifications to existing items?
---
When new items are added to loot tables, you’re generally seeing a deliberate effort to provide catch-up gear and/or to provide new goals for players who had exhausted an existing reward structure. For example, in original WoW, items were added to give players a way to quickly prepare for Ahn’Qiraj without having to spend months in Molten Core and Blackwing Lair.
---
The changing of existing items in patches often illustrated the original design team responding to how players played the game. Their primary goal at the time was to make rewards more relevant and exciting. Developers realizing that Spirit probably wasn’t an ideal stat for a warrior raid set helm* was an example of this sort of change.
---
Many class abilities and talents evolved similarly. For example, going into Patch 1.8.0, the game designers determined that Moonkin Form would be a more compelling 31-point Balance druid talent than the original selection of Hurricane.
---
It’s important to remember that there’s more to WoW Classic than a long series of changes. Even if each item change could be made, and even if every class change could be progressively recreated, that would still only constitute a piece of the overall landscape of original WoW. We remember how early raid progression was punctuated by unexpected roadblocks and workarounds:
---
As far as we know, every one of the first Ragnaros kills was only possible due to a bug that made Lava Burst temporarily stop firing after a wipe.
---
Chromaggus was practically unbeatable due to Ignite Flesh unavoidably and lethally stacking on tanks, until it was discovered that Flamegor’s ramp in the laboratory allowed the entire raid to damage Chromaggus without being exposed to his breath attacks.
---
C’Thun was infamously seen as unkillable until a hotfix in April 2006 prevented additional tentacles from spawning while he was vulnerable.
---
Recreating, and then re-fixing every major progression-affecting bug wouldn’t account for what we think matters much more: the people playing the game. There were many unknowns in original WoW. The first guilds to reach Nefarian spent their initial pulls testing different ideas they had and trying to figure out what condition would get them past the first part of the fight (defeating 40 drakonids). That experience can’t be recreated, because the knowledge can’t be unlearned. For a long time after Patch 1.4.0 came out, many players simply had no idea how good Obsidian Edged Blade or Aged Core Leather Gloves were. The power of weapon skill will be no surprise in WoW Classic.
---
So rather than try to recreate a specific experience from 2005 that can never fully be recaptured, our aim has been to accurately and fully restore the original game’s mechanics and stats to their final and most polished state from before The Burning Crusade. That mission has been a pillar of WoW Classic’s design from its inception.
---
This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions. That should take the pressure off players to be constantly figuring out what we might do next to remain exactly in line with how the game once played out, and we can all focus a little more on community building and enjoying the experience together.

Spriest is a fucking MONSTER for 1v1 pvp throughout all of Vanilla and BC. Basically SWP + Mind Blast will kill most people by the end of your ticks. Priests are also the best tank healers and coveted for all content so your pve spot is secure.
---
He's a paladin so gets his mount for free, doesn't do professions other than enchanting(which lets him disenchant items to compress them).  He can vendor or dust+AH everything without stress, he's already better off experience wise than most players using bank alts.
---
I could not disagree with this more
---
C Thun will be dead in 3-6 hours after the instance opens by pserver guilds who've been doing AQ for the last 3 years. The average guild, though, is going to collapse during Aq40 and will have to merge with another raid team. C Thun is a massive step up in difficulty from BWL.
---
Honor and "horde" don't go together
---
Every healer I've ever run with, including my so, loved the healing in there with 4 dps
---
They still are, unless you are overgeared/overleveled. The thing is, until you reach the last 2-3 instances near endgame, it’s so easy to become overgeared/overleveled that most players don’t even go in before that point. (Exception for healers who can get by being lower level than the rest of the group.)
---
Then i fucking hate his persona, and considering i don't interact with him in real life, this is still awesome to see his retarded persona having his ass handed back to him.
---
Tank strat live runs and reserve the first righous orb drop. As long as everyone knows well in advance that you're taking the first orb you shouldn't get flamed.
---
Yeah they are low, not really worth it right now. Less hassle and risk when you just vendor them.
---
What happens if you have an inappropriate name and it gets reported loads of times while you’re playing? Will a GM message you and ask what you want to rename the character, or will it just flag up next time you log on?
---
9 layers of hell
---
Really? You did level 25-30 stuff -- zones, mobs, and a dungeon -- at level 23? I assume you had help -- either a group or a much higher-level partner. So you essentially cheated the quest?
---
Here's the actual blue post regarding the topic. It's almost like they have a consistent logical design decision.
---
What level did you get the chain?  20.  The quest is not a level 30 quest.  That's why the gear is like it is.  You can see examples of this all over.  Another great example is the plate boots you get in STV for turning in the chapters.  Those boots suck for level 40 plate boots.  You know why?  Because they are the reward for a quest you get at level 30.
---
I’m pretty sure that you always get at least 1 point
---
What you did in 1 dungeon with 1 other arms warrior is irrelevant, there are loads of reasons that could be the case.
---
It's built into the spec that you will be doing more damage with sweeping strikes &amp; aoe attacks in generic dungeons cleaving down mobs than with Fury. In an aoe situation Sweeping Strikes is literally 5 weapon strikes at the cost of 30 rage and Whirlwind is already better with a 2 handed weapon. 
---
Fury has literally 0 boosts to aoe so claiming it does better damage than arms in dungeons is just spreading misinformation.
---
Be a streamer, subscriber/moderator or friend of Sodapoppin, Nmp, Tipsout or other officers.
---
I'll probably queue up as DPS/off heals sometimes.   Is that viable?
---
And I'm loving it.  So much more "bustle" around.

So how does this work?  I have seen enough times mobs don't care a flip about line of sight if you are close enough on the other side of a wall for aggroing.

I almost always logged at Org... of course the one time I didn't was in The Hinterlands.
---
Streamers vs streamer that both rely on zergs because that's how wpvp works.
---
The feels when you equip BOE boots from Scarlet Monastery because they’re part of a set... not knowing they’re worth a lot on the AH AND YOU’RE 3 LEVELS FROM 40 AND YOU DON’T EVEN HAVE HALF THE GOLD NEEDED FOR YOUR MOUNT.
---
Is the cap per character or per account?
---
Do mails to your alts and guild members count towards the cap?

Actually was killing Satyrs in Felwood for a quest yesterday morning a a NE Spriest watched me die as I accidentally pulled 1 to many mobs. I ran back and rezzed and he was standing right night next to me having killed my mobs. In /say I ask him "Dude, couldn't have threw me a Rezz?" He responded, "Ohh man not my job." I just shrugged it off and add his name to my "Ain't tanking for you list" Few minutes later I killed the Last Satyr I needed, all of a Sudden a 60 UD Lock shows up and starts ripping into the NE Spriest, he yells at me, "HELP DUDE!!!" I just shrug and /say Ohh man not my job." Rode off laughing to myself.
---
To make matters worse he /w me and called me some very colorful words. When I responded he had ignored me so I just ignored him back and went on my merry way.

I wanted to possibly log in in the UK, I’m US. I’m going to be there awhile so even if I get ban I wouldn’t lose play time.

I always have food due to fishing and cooking but I ran out once and helped a mage kill a mob then said “I’m sorry to be that guy, but please could I get some food? I’m completely out” guy makes me food and clicks accept, “thanks! And sorry to be a pest, I know it’s annoying”. Guy says “you don’t have to be sorry, you should always ask mages for food, it’s free for us! People who find it annoying are just assholes”

I would go Dwarf priest if you want to do shadow and be PvP oriented. Like you said, Fear Ward is very, very good in PvE and PvP. I play an Undead Priest and running in for a Psychic Scream, I always think twice if its a dwarf priest or a dwarf priest is in the enemy group.
---
you can do BRD pickpocketing runs. once you get some better gear you can start killing some of the bosses to. there's also an LBRS pickpocketing run that has a chance to run into the rare spawn that drops Arcanite Reaper recipe, and another set of trash mobs you can kill that drops the epic mage robe pattern
---
Yup, also have self heal.  Biggest drawback is they have way less burst and way less cc, but if you’re looking for a guerilla warfare class they’re a solid choice.  Also great as flag cappers in WSG.

Fair, to each their own! Just less consistent burst with fury but more overall dps. I found in vanilla that super geared people could do really well as fury but every average geared people could do fairly well as arms.
---
Not to mention Auctionator's disenchant value addon also made it extremely difficult to profit off imbalances in gear prices.  Everyone can see it plain as day now and take advantage in AH unless you're quick and/or lucky.

---
Yeah, unfortunately it happens all the damned time.  I've been burned one too many times to ever allow a DPS Warrior into a pickup group again.
---
Hybrid DPS in general can be problematic.  It's like they finally get in as a DPS and feel they have to show the world just how amazing they can be at DPS.
---
The reality of it is that no one gives a shit about their DPS but them.  So they tunnel vision on doing everything they can to maximize their DPS while failing to participate in a clean run.
---
So you have Warriors charging in and using Whirlwind before the tank has the pull positioned and threat established.  You get Shadow Priests who use Mind Blast on cooldown and DoT up CC targets.  Moonkins blowing their entire mana bar on each pull and wanting the rest of the group to wait for them to drink to full in between.
---
Like, I've never left a dungeon group and thought to myself, "Goddamn!  That one DPS was doing such much damage that I couldn't even maintain threat over them!  I should really put that motherfucker on my friends list so they can do it again in the future!"
---
When you get that combined with bringing absolutely nothing to the group but an extra roll on gear you quickly decide to never invite them again.  A shit Mage can buff AI and pass out water, maybe even sheep a mob or two, but a shit DPS Warrior brings what?  Fuck all!
---
&gt; Those boots suck for level 40 plate boots.
---
You know, level 40 is the lowest level for plate, for anyone/anything? This is like saying, "this cloak sucks for a level 1 cloak."
---
&gt;What level did you get the chain? 20. The quest is not a level 30 quest.

As I've answered to multiple other commenters: The first quest in the chain that eventually leads to the Brutal Armor quests starts at 20. But the BA quests are literally "[30] Brutal Armor", and require going into level 25-30 zones, killing level 25-30 mobs, plus killing a level 28 elite in a level 30+ dungeon.
---
Why is it unreasonable for a player to think the reward for a class-specific quest chain labeled "[30]" would give a reward at least equal to level 30 gear? Heck, the BA gear is not as good as my level 24 gear -- that I got just from random mob drops (and a blacksmithing item).
---
Summed it up perfectly.
---
Damage from drain life outpaces wands after a while... so it is just better to tap life, and then drain life back up and actually fairly efficient too. 
---
There are guides on drain tanking.
---
Thanks for this. I had forgotten his name.
---
Rad, thanks!   
---
I didn't mean to imply that i need to just turn my brain off. I just kind of enjoy the repetitive cadence of mob grinding. But what i actually DO during that grind is fine being more or less involved, if that makes sens :)
---
Rogue actually has slightly higher DPS over multiple fights or longer fights. Warrior is at the top of MC logs because the fights are short and Execute crits at the end skew the DPS numbers dramatically
---
It really blows my mind the amount of people go out of their way to express how much they hate asmongold.  If anything he does a lot to boost the popularity of the game when he streams just doing dumb shit and dumb ingame drama to 80k people at a time.  You don't have to watch him and you can even revel in seeing him get killed by some horde, but some people here are way too wrapped up in the hate lol.
---
Those people are fucking morons.
---
Here you go buddy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hrDzZN0bDg
---
Imp regrowth what is that like 30% of your mana wearing healing greens lel
---
this is the real fairy tale ending
---
Yeah... kinda, but it comes from exaggerating his normal personality, he is more or less caricaturing himself.
---
I think you can also do this with macros.
---
I don't know the exact syntax, but it's something like 
---
&gt;#showtooltip
---
&gt;/Cast [form: bear] swipe
---
&gt;/Cast [form: cat] take
---
Or something along those lines.
---
That threat meter is a whiteboard that allows real-time public display of all raid-members threat.
---
#TIIINK TIIIIIIINK
---
Thanks for clarification, I thought it was needed to wear. Isn't that 2% crit bonus pretty nice though or would having a different profession be better?
---
I think some people don't know about MS paint is the real problem here
---
So what happens if he's called upon to heal? Is his answer a no?
---
Just wondering, not judging.
---
Uhhh, servers didn’t get merged though.
---
Ohhh i see so its like you have unlimited mana/hp. So you dont even rquip wands after or u still do for stats
---
If they're melee cleaving, tgey should, ideally have a priest w/ spirit tap, and letting him last hit a mob to proc it at the end of a fight. If you aren't a priest, they should expect down time.
---
Glad i was right in my judgment to not ever see any video with this guy just by looking at his thumbnails on youtube.
---
Why not just buy it from vendors? Seems easier. Not very expensive either.
---
You are woefully wrong on this one my friend. The faster the weapon speed the more rage on average you will be generating (more chances to hit, and more importantly more chances to crit). That is why you'll see tanks always go for super fast mainhand weps, even daggers sometimes, because it optimizes their rage generations. Trust me fast offhand is a must for a fury war
---
Not sure why that's a bad thing.  I just don't understand people who sign up for a PVP server and have any issues/complaints.  I can't stand PVP - I'm terrible at it in every way - so I don't join a PVP server.  Simple.  I would hate to be ganked over and over again, so I avoid those situations.  If you're a casual player and are going to get tired of being camped, then why join?
---
How is it catering to "tryhards"? Even very casual players will be hitting 60 with a month of leeway.
---
Upstairs does, as does the balcony at the rear of the main floor.
---
I really didn’t think you would, We obviously have two very different opinions on things. One for you to think on, if you think what I’m doing is “bullying” how exactly would you describe what you’re doing? 
---
There’s nothing gained by you being negative in comments.
---
Infallible logic. Calling someone an idiot because they think transmog didn’t kill wow. Grow up dude. You just miss feeling special in game with your gear you grind for when no one really cares about it besides you. You’re literally bitching that “shitters” are allowed to look cool on a video game. You know how sad you sound?
---
GM can't change name length over max allowed. That is in the code.
---
There's a lot of wiggle room between greens and BIS.  Have you experienced all of the 5-10 man instances and taken upgrades as they dropped or are you literally in greens and went hoping to get specific drops over and over?
---
Once you get used to his slow pace videos, he is great. He has a good sense of humor too and is pretty self aware.
---
What I tend to do is if I have a stack of completed quests to hand in and I'm 3 or 4 bars from a new level, I'll grind out those 3 or 4 bars then turn the quests in.   Coupled with killing everything I can between point A and point B,  it keeps the XP flowing and splitting those grinds into smaller "micro grinds" makes it all more bearable.   It also means you'll never run out of quests.
---
That's fine. It's all good to not enjoy something. There's a lot of aspects of his streams I don't like.
---
I just hit lvl 40 with my warrior but I'm still a pedestrian (only 59g atm). What should I farm so I can get to 100g ASAP and also getting decent xp at the same time?
---
I'm a human warrior BTW.
---
That's retail.
---
I really like my Logitech G502. Its buttons are all easily accessible by your thumb and index finger, and there's about 6 of them.

How embarrassing would it be to get beaten up by a bunch of idiots though, like hey you werent smart enough to not get shitstomped by a bunch of idiots.
---
Reported adolfcritler the other day on deviate delight. He is still running around with the same name.

The ring is BiS till Naxx.
---
I’m a 30 warrior and have been two handing and shield 1h for tanking. Should I duel wield instead if I find some good weapons?
---
Brah, Mara princess is immune to serpent sting, most of your damage comes from auto shots. You have no idea how mara is done in classic.
---
Yes! Run to the Tank! (and stay in LOS of healer)
---
VW is mediocre if he jumps in at start -- he's not built to keep up with other DPS. If you are 70 to 90% through a fight and something breaks towards the Healer, his first taunt will bounce him to the top of the threat chart and he'll have a good chance to hold agro for the rest of the fight (or until the Tank finishes off his targets and moves to help VW).
---
[Dishonorable Kills](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fvanilla-wow.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FDishonorable_Kill&amp;iie=1)
---
The fact you think just the added &lt;3 makes his messaging embarrassing says alot about you.
---
Go punch boars!
---
Pretty much yeah, he wants to be kitty and that's about it. He MIGHT heal occasionally at 60 but it would be against his will, lol. He had played kitty druid from vanilla through every expansion with no alts.
---
How much value does a great level 30 staff have when it's likely to be replaced in 5 or 6 levels?  And how do I (as a non user of the item) know that the potential user of the item is actually going to equip it instead of selling it?
---
You're a child. Thankfully, not all Priest think like you.
---
I switched from a mage to a priest as my main and my priest is so easy to level. Not only is it super easy to bubble, cast a couple spells, and wand shit to death, but you'll also find it easier to find groups for elites because you can heal. That's been my experience, at least. 
---
Compared to the mage, my priest has almost zero downtime (note: this will be true once you get five talent points in Spirit Tap, so the first few levels might be a little bit slower), can handle multiple pulls as long as they aren't overleveled, and is more fun to play. Once you get five points in Spirit Tap and five in Wand Specialization, it's almost a face roll to zone out and grind or farm.
---
lmao how pathetic can you be
---
I agree with that assessment 100%.
---
Warrior is more played, probably because of it being a complete and excellent class. (Best raid tank and top melee dps).
---
I mean its not like he is just posting signs up in his town, or trying to cash in on his hours played on 10 year old steam games.  He is selling to those interested in playing wow, who may see value in time saved to get into the game that people are actively playing.  
---
He wasn’t keeping track and saying “I played 400 hours therefor I am owed 400$, someone simply said “that’s like 3$ an hour”  I wouldn’t personally buy a wow account but people literally have been for 15 years.  It has value because people give it value, just like anything else.
---
I guess I'll try it tonight with only 3/5 MoD and see how it goes :)
---
nothing about that looks fun or challenging.
---
Yeah I have a hard time leveling elsewhere. The atmosphere is just.....so on point.
---
What a fulfilling turn in that will be 👌
---
I thought this too, right up until reading this post....
---
On deviate delight they're 7s a piece
---
&gt; to me, that sounds like less time in one block, and little if no preparation.
---
I don't think most people who say "casual" mean unprepared or unreliable.
---
I think they mean they don't have time to be hardcore tryharding 20-40 hours a week, they're limited to maybe one raid night and a couple non-raiding nights to get gear/consumables.
---
Yep!
---
The entire joke is pretty much completely lifted from the Rick and Morty ep with "Freddy Krueger"
---
What perk do you get for being friendly with booty bay? And what reputation do you have to be to not worry about repercussions from attacking an opposing faction in booty bay?
---
I don't get how anyone can bypass the first area, before you even get to an inn, of their starting zone. That's like an hour and six levels.
---
Haha his face was priceless, bet he cried that night.
---
That's amazing
---
I don't even understand the desire to DPS as a priest in Classic. If I got asked to go Shadow so I can buff Warlock dps...I would just swap to a pure dps class, it would be more satisfying and a better investment of gear.
---
You stated the obvious?
---
theres nothing gained in any way on reddit, just a bunch of people posting opinions, and yet there is this general attitude that negativity should always be silenced. People have a right to express their opinion on stuff even tho its negative, without comments like yours.
---
Arms tanking is good though, if not better in dungeons while leveling
---
I always feel awkward when I see people foolishly thinking they know something about another persons personality solely based upon a few lines of text-based communication. To each their own.
---
Let's analyze this then. You are not hit capped or even slightly close, especially at this level. You aren't even in the ballpark of be hard hit capped (meaning your auto attacks will miss). (Granted you should never really be hard hit capped). That means in 10 seconds you get off say 4 swings with a slower wep. Because it's an off hand your chance to miss or glance is extremely high. Your chance to crit on those 4 swings is thus even lower, and therefore you definitely aren't getting much of that double rate generation for crits. 
---
Now if you have a fast off hand like a 1.5 speed or something similar you are hitting more like 7 times per 10 seconds. Still the high chance to miss, but your chance to crit just effectively doubled. Meaning, you now have double the chance to double the rage generation. Additionally,  the game is not so straight forward that a slow wep and fast wep will average out to the same amount of rage. You actually get more rage every time you hit something than the additional rage you get from swinging a slightly slower wep. (Go ahead, test it out.) 
---
In sum, I've been playing a fury war on a private servers for years and I've experimented with every possible way to maximize my raid dps. When you throw in the fact that ALL of our abilities except WW are based on attack power not weapon dmg you realize that you gain nothing for having a slow offhand, but actually do gain something (more rage) for having a fast off hand.
---
OP, you dont have to take my word for it, go try it out. I promise you'll see better rage generation with a 1.5 off hand than a 2.7 off hand
---
I just press the auto run button a second time to turn my NumLock back on
---
Maybe hard for you.  Content was always at 4 phases. You read wrong from the very start. They then later added two phases.

You keep making that claim without backing it up.

Well played

Hmm not 100% on that but that sounds about right
---
Why is this tool popular? What am I missing?
---
What an absolute champ Holy!
---
Glad to hear the research findings are corroborated by your experience. 
---
One thing I think attracted many to shadow is the aesthetic of shadowform.
---
That is an important aspect that no damage-centric study can speak to. Yet it is important. So many looked forward to the ability for more than just the tactile benefits - the vibe of a shadowpriest is heightened by that visual distinction.
---
Was in a guild at the start of classic where a dude would say this to every single person joining. This was a public guild mass recruiting..

They say vision is the first thing to go

I think it’s a good thing, it looks awesome!

haha kids my age listen to trash music like rap and pop. My parents raised my right, I love *insert option here* (The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Nirvana)
---
You dont learn it until level 22 but yeah, you usually sunder until 80-60% then spam hamstring
---
A healer told me to stop using a 2hander (Ancient War Sword) use a shield (using bfd green 1hander+random green shield) otherwise he'd leave the group. I complied and obviously was rage starved, had to pull less mobs, it took forever to clear packs, always losing aggro because no rage to sunder. Until we finally wiped because someone body pulled and I couldn't do anything to get threat off the healer.  
---
Switched back to 2hander and he didn't say anything for the rest of the dungeon.
---
No bloody kidding! I was in Razor Hill just minding my business and I saw an orc walk up to a troll mage. 
---
The orc politely asks, 'Hey, can I get a portal to Orgrimmar? 50s tip.'
---
The troll replies, 'It's just up the road though, you should just walk.'
---
The orc did not like this at all, 'All mages are stupid.' - narrator, he did not say this.
---
u r so smurt

you sound like someone who laughs at farts

He's living in their head rentfree.
---
low level +sdmg gear scales badly
---
You guys just think family guy is the funniest show of all time...
---
the thing i don't get is that feral is the best leveling spec, you get tanking talents since they are combined and you likly got LW and skinning that means you stacked some armor kits on yourself so you should be taking no damage while doing much better in the threat department than a sword and board warrior just everybody seems to want a warrior even if they are arms or fury.
---
Yeah, I typically tell people to just go for one of the readily available 1.2 attack speed Swamp Jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows instead of spending hours trying to get Brokentooth. There's just not much reason to, especially since you'll have more than enough pushback between both you and your pet hitting somebody.
---
So I'm petty because I gave him the same courtesy he gave me?
---
I wouldn't say warlock isn't pure dps. The utility you provide is most often out of combat, the extent of in combat is soulstoning someone to avoid a wipe. In current content warlocks are kinda gimped by gear choices and yeah the 16 debuff limit, but you can still excel easily.
---
Sorry if this belongs in "WSIPW"  
---
So I've just reached lvl 50 on my hunter (main) and I will be trying to use the most out of rested exp by leveling an alt. My plan originally was to always main my hunter until P3 and then make the swap to my second character as that's when hunters begin to fall behind in PvE.   
---
I've been strongly considering druid and shaman although have also considered rogue as i do like to dps, any thoughts?
---
Right clicking to auto attack something? My dude...
---
In December 04 none of us knew shit. We beat Onyxia on the 2nd try and from then off we were off to the races. I don't recall seeing any published guides until the game got really popular a few months later. Most of the forums were dead wrong, too. I rember there being quite a debate about what exactly attack power did at the time, lol.
---
We should form a union.
---
Their explanation of how item availability is a different issue from item stats/design actually seems to imply that the bindings shouldn't drop until we catch up to the point where they were added to the Classic loot table, since that's an availability issue.
---
Same thing happened to me. I’ve had the same account for 15 years without breaking terms of service and then I get hit with a 30 day suspension for this. I offered to provide information and proof of my travels but it did not change the outcome. After a few appeals, they actually threatened to punish me further if I continue appealing. GG
---
Doesn't dark pact just drain some mana?
---
No one is going to quit playing... &lt;10-15% aren't even 60 yet. The game NEEDS to be catered around the average player, not the smallest percent of the game who blows through everything and demands content.
---
Look at the disaster retail is if you want to see what happens when you let Method design raids and balance the game.
---
Details! Has a setting that allows you to toggle to for Healing Taken at which point when you mouseover your name in the list you'll see what you're getting.
---
"But I can't Charge once we're in combat!"
---
"No shit, go sit back there with the casters and wait til I have them positioned and then you can Charge in...or better yet, I don't fucking care that you can't use Charge, quit fucking up my aggro!"
---
Last boss in Ulda drops a nice hammer for L44
---
This, makes it a lot harder to tell what he is doing. Also why leave in the clips where he is just nuking people on mounts?
---
You really went detective on this guy over this? You look ridiculous.
---
Druid!
---
Luckily for you, most of the dungeons people either remember vividly or have run enough recently that even if you get lost you'll still be okay.
---
Personally, I would suggest that you don't even think about being a dedicated tank until you're much higher in levels, unless you strictly plan on running dungeons and not questing at all. Protection spec is horrendous for questing as your time to kill is insanely long.
---
I love my Warrior. It's been my main class since Vanilla. But i would honestly take a look at Druid if you want to tank. Their tank spec also dovetails with their best leveling spec.
---
Well done lads!
---
I really hope Blizzard reads comments on reddit and realizes to release content around the average player and not the top 5-10% of the game. 
---
Everyone is still leveling.
---
In Luna settings, you can set how far out the bar will go when overhealing. I think 0 makes it flush with the health bar.
---
Isn't the mount 80 gold and the training 20 gold? The pic is of 89g,99s,99c . Guess I dont get it.
---
Pretty easy to figure out what they mean based on context clues...
---
LMAO
---
18 is very low for WC. You will notice greatly reduced threat and rage generation (because of misses, etc.) any time you're underleveled. Not only that, but if your party members are appropriately leveled they will be generating relatively more threat.
---
Mage. Mages can solo AoE grind packs of enemies at a time, and escape if they pull too many.
---
Try again now, I just added a dropbox link. Let me know if that works.
---
They don't act on it. It's just an automatic system, you get flagged for rename based on # of reports.
---
&gt; Fear is instant, it won't get any faster with Shadow.
---
The cooldown, genius.
---
&gt; Smite is 2s, and those 0.5s more won't make that much of a difference.
---
It's 25% slower. It definitely makes a huge difference.
---
Let me put it this way, against what classes do you think disc will do better against than shadow? This way, we can be more specific.
---
I generally mark the target for the DPS to be on and sunder it twice before tab and sunder other mobs, relying on taunt to catch one if I need to.
---
I’m current fury spec and find I have rage issues from time to time, but generally I’m good on threat as the higher crit chance helps.
---
Roll for chests.
---
Nice. Unfortunately buying the leathers on my servers cost more than the items themselves .... It's like 200g for just the leathers needed, but 180g for gloves and leggings..

How do I get to Ungoro crater as an alliance?

Thanks Perd

All leveling holy pallies... I can say the same about some of the other hybrids.  Had a druid said they could tank and they were intellect cloth gear for most of their pieces.
---
Working as it worked in classic.
---
Check out [StaySafeTV](https://www.twitch.tv/staysafetv). He's currently farming Mauradon right now on a Warlock. He also did a YouTube video on it found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMQymNHZcUk). He's made a couple updates to the run since the video released and I believe he'll have an updated video posted soon.
---
Not enough spelling mistakes for his 11 year old fan base.
---
wow thats embarrassing
---
100%.
---
They NEED to let these phases simmer VERY long. Everyone wants 3+ years of classic not 1 1/2...
---
Always roll need on all boe’s, no more rand 100 ninjas just like that.
---
I have warlock guildies who do princess runs for hours so I know it's doable.
---
damn thats a troll and a half
---
And somehow there are zero screenshots or video of it happening. Ok. Well if you can't accurately document this "bug", it's most likely just user error.
---
I actually give a fuck, and support the last statement.
---
Get +movement speed on boots.
---
Its where warriors hook their rope so they can keep track of their healer
---
I think it's a bit of a [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), if everyone played nice, we could just greed on BoE's and believe that people needing are going to equip it. But since some people don't do this, we'd rather just roll need and deprive people who could use it the chance to do so, giving everyone an equal chance rather than a fair one.
---
Whatever mob resists affect it, but afaik not much of anything else affects wand damage outside of ranged crit chance because it's not considered spell damage.
---
you are downvoted but its true, i leveled DW fury and it was a lot of fun. do you miss more? sure. but missing when you have a slow ass 2H feels a lot worse than when you miss a swing with an OH. i feel like arms is pushed because people like WW with mortal strike and thats it
---
Don’t use Sunder Armor except when tanking
---
The fact that you invest more time into the game doesn't mean you are better. Quantity =/= quality. You sound like a shitty player with a ton of time imo.
---
Curse of weakness reduces damage to the tank. Elements and shadows boosts team mates dps.
---
Asking for money for the service is not a problem. It's the way mages ask for it. "Sure, 1g please" is far from responding with nothing other than "1g". I'll find a mage with a bit more etiquette.
---
&gt;So rather than try to recreate a specific experience from 2005 that can never fully be recaptured, our aim has been to accurately and fully restore the original game’s mechanics and stats to their final and most polished state from before The Burning Crusade. That mission has been a pillar of WoW Classic’s design from its inception.
---
Bindings were a staple of MC. They're not going to add them later because "that's how it was in vanilla" they are trying to make everything as consistent as possible. It's a design philosophy. I honestly don't understand how to state it any more clearly than the blue post does.
---
Haven’t been able to figure it out

The high end herbs and ore are still pretty expensive though
---
Man why the hell aren't you starting an argument with me over opposing views?? You're causing me to upvote you when my natural state urges me to downvote.
---
People already at endgame...? That is such a small portion of the population 80% of the playerbase is still leveling. And that is what Blizzard needs to release content around. 
---
If you have already completed the game, go find something else to fill your time. You are not the majority.
---
Ah, okay, I couldn't remember - haven't played a mage since early WotLK. Still though - we're both using mana, and I'm also using a shard, yet somehow his resources are more important than mine.
---
Not rogue.... I wish, but rogue is not the answer
---
Imagine insulting someone for not knowing every detail of a video game road map. I love how you're attempting to have a nice "gotcha" moment while failing to realize that you're only coming off as a pretentious dick who missed the original point entirely.
---
You only need a few people. They don't need to be super high level.
---
People were getting Whirlwind axes on the stress test when it was capped at 30.
---
As a combo wannabe tank/DPS, I'd like to stress that using raid icons is supergood whnever you pull 3+ mobs. I rather have one unnecessary skull, than die from bad luck and poor prioritation.
---
Nothing like desperately trying to keep aggro on an uncomfortable number of mobs with scattered DPS
---
Bingo. I’m over 9 days /played and only level 46. But I’ve never really gotten into WoW before and rolled a warrior, so I’m having a blast anyway
---
Since you already have the off-hand, the main-hand will be a huge upgrade, decidedly worth going for!
---
I want to play like this on a druid. If you can get rank 10 the pvp gear has some of all of the stats. You could do a bit if everything and swap weapons depending on if you are casting or scratching. I have know idea if if will be good but it will definetly be fun.
---
And 100 percent reason to remember the guild name
---
Not sure in what context you are using this word “Perd”
---
AOE is way better for grinding to 60 as fast as possible. The other way will let you experience the rest of the game. But if you want to get into the raids that they are already running as soon as possible. Aoe is the way to go
---
Every class has different expenses so don't feel too bad. My best advice is to not stop questing to try to farm the money for your mount. You get enough money from questing and leveling that you'll get it by just continuing your adventures. Might not be till 45 but that's okay!
---
If he’s a punching bag what would you call the horde that they kill all day on his stream lmao?
---
It’s got a cruel barb and bought a cheap blue mace at lvl 19 and duel wielded through lvl 28,  duel wield is great, and possibly better, but requires two good weapons over one, making it more difficult
---
My guild is buying them as fast as people post them right now. The prices are about to skyrocket.
---
Go outside and kill a level 7 boar lol
---
That title is straight out of facebook
---
Alliance scum!
---
Definitely a compliment.
---
Sooo...any solutions? Is selling anything on the AH worth doing? or should I just try farming grey items to sell from mobs?
---
asmongold fucking sucks at pvp
---
Thank you for this.  In my PC use history, there has never been a time I wanted it off.
---
:O I'm blown away.
---
Thunderfury itself is still gated to the proper "phase". some of the materials are just allowed to drop earlier. They specifically state they are trying to emulate things on a case by case basis from their most polished state.
---
That's a nice healthbar addon for nameplates, whatever it is
---
defensive stance does increase threat. something to think about is revenge cost 5 rage and generates much more threat than a sunder armor, though its on a 5 second cooldown. use it whenever its available.
---
I love all those chosing where to ding 60 posts!
---
This is also a good one 🍺
---
Do you have an actual argument to *not* do that? What else would you even bind right click to? Macroing it serves no purpose
---
I wouldn’t call spriest godlike.
---
Out of the three specs a priest can do, it is far and away the best for vanilla as PVP is concerned.
---
Yet don’t get it twisted: locks and mages are godlike for PvP. Shadow is a less versatile lock.
---
Sounds like you don't need to imagine.
---
Yes. And if you cleave, the cleaved target sets off a stack of Sweeping Strikes, too.
---
Afk
---
No it'll be good sometimes, but a large majority of it will be pretty obviously low levels getting shit on by good 60s
---
Didn't he fail at raiding cities? Maybe this is the best he can do...
---
^^^^ʞuᴉʇ ^^^^ʞuᴉʇ
---
Because you claimed that fishing is the reason you have 60g at 29 but also claimed to have only spent 2 hours fishing.  Which is not enough to time to earn 60g.  Not sure why that needed to be explained in depth.
---
Small correction:  you should soul stone the rezzer,  not necessarily the healer.
---
I didn't say it mattered, but it is the mature and right thing to do regardless. Do you see the difference or need more clarity?
---
I'm going to start addressing points in separate replies so we don't edit over each other.
---
&gt; Mind Flay coefficient should be correct
---
Refer to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/). Mind flay is weird.
---
I respected and got Princess Theradras's scepter and only just replaced it at 60.
---
this is a rp server
---
I hope this DPS warrior won't hit need on tanking items.
---
Last night was the first time I had a queue in nearly 2 weeks on Herod and it was only 500 people so it was less than 10 minutes. That was at 8PM EDT so nearly at peak hour. Its was very noticeable once they started migration and now it's at an extremely acceptable level.
---
Silence them before they can silence you and get off a fear first.
---
keep your distance to avoid their fear and wear them down with dots and drain life.
---
i totally believe you, but that really wasn't really the point I was attempting to convey to the previous gentlemen. 
---
What i was referring to was basically just something of low supply (a rare item) that could be sold for alot.
---
Played a troll spriest in original. Was hilarious when an opponent would stub themselves from attacking you.
---
Don't forget the most op combo in the game with seduce + soul fire ( putting it above pom+pyro since that needs a meme build).  
---
Warlocks have some notable downsides however: lack of mobility, 1 bag dedicated to soul shards, having to farm them for summons and health stones, harder to play well in pvp, their aoe literally kills themselves, healers who don't understand life tap hate them, etc.
---
I’m hoping some people have learned that giving players everything at once and trying to keep them hooked doesn’t work. Blizzard is, whether they know it or not, playing the long game with phases in this sense. It makes far more sense to have content that people might come back for.
---
SoUnDs LiKe YoU DoN’t NeEd To ImAgInE.

I use yaHT(yet another hunter timer) on my hunter seems to work just fine
---
/r/notliketheotherkids
---
How many more of this posts
---
it's a bot + hack, as in they never every take a single step just teleport directly to each herb.
---
Sure, and I’m here to have fun and at the end of the day, why should 39 people raid for 10 minutes longer so they can carry a Ret who is going to steal gear from fury warriors?
---
That Ret had better earn it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
---
I've grouped with warriors in BRD that still have their whirlwind axes and do just fine. If you absolutely want to change it, go for the Uldaman weapon or get Gatorbite from the crocodile boss in Maraudon . But you can stick with the whirlwind axe basically up to lvl 60 (though you'll probably find something better along the way).
---
Not really free since you lose about 100 g in not looting stuff cuz of shards
---
I am afraid it will get worse. I already see some gatekeeping and loot whoreing going on. 3 weeks ago i saw a shaman deny other leather wearers spots in his wailing caverns group. Wailing caverns? Lol
---
Ulda, ZF or Mara. Ulda for the hammer, ZF for The Chief's Enforcer staff and Mara for the hammer from Princess.
---
Adding someone on Battlenet to talk shit. That's a new one.
---
I mean, I do have a level 1 warrior on Moonguard called Urbadatpvp....
---
But friending someone to talk shit? That's next level.
---
What the fuck...so it's basically just a massivd mob of retarded youtube and twitch fanboys.
---
Axe from the croc in maradoun is good.
---
I'm at 58 using Beastslayer from an Un'Goro quest, which is trash, but the time to farm a better one is probably just better spent leveling
---
Is there a place for feral druids in raids? I don't really enjoy raiding, and my only intent is to get some gear in time for the release of battlegrounds. I don't want to heal as I find it quite stressful, but I was wondering if I'm feral with leader of the pack, would it be useful?
---
Yeah, I think it’s important to just get it out there if nothing else. I’ve accidentally skulled the wrong target before (usually one with more hp compared to one with a lot less). I usually just leave it on whatever target I accidentally put it on so DPS aren’t confused.
---
Drop rate was way worse in vanilla, haven't tried farming in classic. In vanilla I spent a few days farming this from the elites, several hundred kills.
---
I know how the network works with an authoritative game server.
---
The thing is op said "My wild guess is that the problem is how they are working with database to sync player data. I don’t have any proofs just from experience and gut feeling" but that has nothing to do with DB, sending datas to other players as you mentioned and syncing characters every n seconds are 2 totally different things, there would be no reason to have poor performance for DB sync just because players are gathered in one area instead of let's say 10 as DB sync doesn't send any datas to other players, it's just between the game server and the DB.
---
Yes, it will. That's why Sweeping Strikes has such value, especially for abilities like Whirlwind/Cleave that affect multiple enemies on their own merit.
---
I ll include this rotation in my life, sweeping strike + whirlwind it's a great thread generator 
---
TY sir, this ll help for sure
---
Any suggestions for making money on bank alts? How did it make most your money?
---
the hinterlands quest hub wasn't added until after launch i don't think the flight path even existed this is more just an oversight i think.
---
i also want to remember it took a REALLY long time for blizzard to actually go back and fix it.
---
The gatorbite axe from the croc boss in Mara. Used till 60 since that is the time the dreadforge retaliator from Emperor in BRD finally dropped. Next I’m aiming at is arcanite reaper. Good luck.
---
report the name then lol
---
Another brilliant display of wit.
---
Items may be exchanged for gold, but as far as the game is concerned, they are not the same thing. Would you trade a single BOE for the same theoretical amount of worth in crafting mats? Probably not, because you understand it's easier to sell a single item for full price than it is to sell 20 items for full price.
---
If it was just gold, that exchange would just be 400 gold for 400 gold. But it's not. Because items are different than gold.
---
Spell Pushback Cap was introduced in WoTLK I believe to have a cap of 2 hits for a total of 1 extra second of cast time. If you were channeling, 2 hits would reduce 25% each for a max of 50% channel duration interruption.
---
This is not the case in Vanilla or Classic WoW. There is no limit.  \[source\]( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2amsbg/what\_was\_bad\_with\_vanilla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2amsbg/what_was_bad_with_vanilla/)) 
---
In that post there is a paragraph which states
---
Rogues and warriors basically dominated PVP, largely because in the absence of resilience and PVP power the ability for weapon damage to scale completely dwarfed the value of anything else. Incidentally, spell pushback caused by melee attacks had no limit. 
---
Another \[source\]([https://blizzardwatch.com/2019/05/22/6-things-completely-forgot-parts-wow-classic/](https://blizzardwatch.com/2019/05/22/6-things-completely-forgot-parts-wow-classic/)) states  In *Classic WoW*, you don’t have the luxury of a limited amount of spell push back. As a result, if you’re a caster fighting a melee enemy, it’s going to take you a lot longer to get a spell cast off. 
---
BM Hunters also get a talent which further increases the attack speed of the pet by 30% when it scores a critical hit, making it more noticeable.
---
Thats actually funny but doesn’t change or negatively affect my point. It’s actually supporting my case since it displays that it’s all about who is around you. Don’t expect every raid to consist of well played rogues and Warriors and still they will somehow manage to get to and kill Ragnaros.
---
It’s just the phrasing, it is a fee of course. People just usually use the word tip for fee in this game.
---
I haven't gotten anything for being friendly. 
---
Not sure that's possible to have the guards ignore you if you attack someone else.
---
Correct.  Personally, I will not switch to Prot spec until 50+ because I stance dance a lot so I level as a hybrid Arms/Fury spec til 40, switch to Arms at 40 so I can have an instant and Tactical Mastery, then Prot at 50.
---
no it's hilarious? im not gonna be a internet hall monitor over a harmless name lol.
---
There's a difference between PvP when you see someone vs 60s camping every flight path trying to rank every second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week until BG's come out.         
---
This isn't like some well damn some guy ganked me, it's going to be 5 man groups or more everywhere. That's not really what people expect from PvP servers
---
You can do this with an alt in group. Just need someone to invite both characters to a group. No second account needed.
---
Mate just rebind auto run to / or * (literally next to num lock), no need to edit registry entries. This is the most ass backwards thing I've ever seen.
---
In my experience when a boe drops everyone kind of freezes. I have a macro I push a button that will say everyone roll need. If someone greeds it before hand thats on them but honestly it rarely happens. if someone says hey guys I really actually wanna use that item can I please need it and the group says yes. They get the chance to equip before a kick, and report. It works out wonderfully, never been called a ninja never had issues with anyone else. If someone f's up we ask winner if they can /roll, it they win they get the item. You can't expect to establish loot rules with people you won't run with on a daily basis. If you try to some people you come off like a jackass. I get what you're saying  for sure but must groups form and go without the expectations of boes dropping.
---
Cheers mate.
---
I should also clarify that it's an alliance only escort quest, so the hordie trying to kill it was only doing it to be a bad person.
---
Time to let Stovokor know a warrior is coming.
---
I need to change my flair to paladin
---
no dude.  theres a similar spec but it's "balance" you're only in feral for feral charge you shouldn't be cat form except for openers.
---
There you go again.  I literally tell you what was wrong with your arguments and this is what you gathered from it:
---
&gt;because they think transmog didn’t kill wow
---
I never said this, I never even implied it.  
---
How do you even get out of your bed in the morning Jesus Christ.
---
The reality is that all of those open world aoe spots are contested 100% of the time. It's impossible.
---
Polearm, axe, mace, sword specializations in the arms tree - should I get all of these from 40-60? As I may be using various weapons or should I just try to stick to only axe weapons or only pole arms till 60? 
---
Does anyone know if any instant strikes or weapon procs reset swing timer?  I read that some things reset your swing timer but also that some of this info is outdated from pserver vs classic live.  I'm a sword spec combat rogue and run with shaman pretty often with WF.
---
I tanked Mara all the way last night at 50 in all cloth  / leather caster mp5 gear with a priest bubble 5 man dps. At 50 it becomes about strategy and interrupts anyway. I hold threat and we go faster than any warrior has been able to.
---
I mean they're pretty much only adding honor, diremaul and Azuregos. MC and everything else will still be not only relevant but the main raid.
---
There will then be 4 more months of MC farming for you. Also, unlike BFA the first tiers will STILL be in use by the time Naxx hits.
---
How are you not tracking what is being said? If 10 gold was earned from fishing in 2 hours, bringing them from 50g to 60g, then fishing was still responsible for getting them to 60g at their current level. They never once claimed to have made a total of 60g from fishing. Either you are purposefully obfuscating the matter or are just really slow on the uptake.
---
Its a sword of Tinker in mara
---
I mean you don't auto log out if your not in the inn...
---
He answered the question asked in your post title.
---
Professions: pickup first aid to make bandages to heal yourself or sell. Then pickup herbalism or mining along with skinning (you will be killing lots of animals) to make some cash. Fishing and cooking is also recommended.
---
Most people that take herb or mining with skinning will drop one or both to switch to the professions they really want to have.
---
I only have tell me when icons on my screen as I dont need my main rotation spells on my ui
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there are plenty of players in the WoW community who have handled server work before. We are a nerdy bunch historically.
---
I do have +movement on boots.
---
An upgrade is need, gold is greed unless discussed otherwise.
---
For anything BoP you are correct.  For BoE’s of high value, your “need” to equip is greed because you can buy it.  You are at that point rolling on the gold value of the item regardless of whether you equip it.
---
Not when you\`re on receiving end.
---
I think a good combo really is the best part of PvP
---
I hit a rogue with a Frostbolt&gt;Frost Nova&gt;Cone of Cold&gt;Fireblast&gt;Cold Snap&gt;Cone of Cold and did something like 2200 damage to him. Two lucky crits with Frostbolt and Cone of cold did most of the legwork. Went from 100% to like 8% health in a few globals it was wicked. Bless critical hits.
---
Wait, so do they just have 40 level 60's on deck ready to go for training purposes?
---
Nah man you derailed it when you decided to be a dick. You just didn't think you would be called on it
---
A guy in our guild helped pay for our tabard, paid for people's skills when they didn't have enough, he basically used every bit of gold he had for any good deed he could find, really nice guy overall. He even pitched in the last gold for my own mount when I was short. 
---
I got a random epic drop, sold it for 250g, and I figure the only acceptable use for that gold is to pay for his mount, so I fenced him 80g without wanting anything back.
---
.... We are no longer friends!
---
There is no class that you do better against flat, it all comes down to how the other person is playing.
---
I.E. if you pvp against mage you can start with a Mind Blast expecting the mage to counterspell it and then smite him to Valhalla. Maybe the mage doesn't counter spell on the first cast, but on the second, then the plan failed.
---
The benefit of Disc in pvp is that you can easily throw in a heal, that is difficult to counter thanks to Martyrdom talent, and you can pop a 20% damage CD to dish out some serious damage. That all of course depends on what your opponent does and the situation. If you manage to get that heal out you have a serious advantage, otherwise that damage reduce from Shadow Form would have been better.
---
Aside from 1vs1 where Disc really shines is in group pvp, because you are a healer and dps at the same time.
---
&gt;It's 25% slower. It definitely makes a huge difference. 
---
2s cast time is still within global cd + lag and tough to kick.
---
Has it ever been confirmed that TBC classic will be released?
---
Nah, just bad.
---
its part of "modui"
---
I was having trouble with princess for awhile too but ive got it down solid now. 
---
My trick is to use voidwalker and barov trinket as backup. You can grab a few swiftness pots too if you really wanna be safe. 
---
What i do is aggro her then head straight for the big rock while dotting up. Then the usual run around to the smaller rock. 
---
This is where the hardest part comes. That big empty area as you go around till u hit the big rock again. 
---
The rocks are the safest spots to kite and the open areas afe where she catches up. Especially if she gets a boulder stun off. You can survive 1 but 2 stuns in a row its GG. 
---
So what ive been doing is to send my voidwalker in after the Princess passes the small rock and gets into the open area. Let it melee her and as soon as she starts farting pull your pet back to make sure it doesnt die. This gives me enough to to get a hell lot of distance and make it safely back to the big rock. 
---
Sometimes the void might die if u dont pull it out fast enough. This is when the barov trinket comes in useful. If your vw dies and you get stunned by boulder in the open area and she is gonna catch u. Pop the trinket and the 3 melee guys will get her to trigger her farts. Then you hoof it to the big rock again. Between vw and barov i havent wiped since. 
---
Was using imp when i first started but imp is ranged and couldnt trigger the farts. Knowing when/how to trigger the farts is the key in farming her and ensuring you get enough distance
---
2 people doing what? If it is dps then the threat is still split between them, it isn't total threat vs tank threat.
---
Just make a macro that auto-deletes soul shards
---
Anyone know what addon gives the big numbers and makes the execute proc pop up?
---
Roll on all weapons. Spec for the best weapon you got :)
---
Lolol some people here really didn’t catch that
---
Unless you click them (and thus mouse over them), using the macro'ed ability doesn't always fix it. I know I can use my macro'ed buffs by hitting their keybinds and not have the correct icon showing yet.
---
The WPVP will be the hardest part
---
Everything will be pugged eventually, you can certainly do that. You can even create a guild for people like you and start your own pugs.
---
Items also seem to be labeled wrong depending on your language. Was in Tanaris trading a middle map fragment for an upper map fragment and this guy who had his client in Korea kept trading me a lower fragment. After much confusion it seems that the Korean translation for lower map fragment actually translated to upper map fragment, so to him he was giving me the upper fragment, but it was the lower. Weird shit.
---
You vendor the cooked food. If you're Horde, grind cats, convert 60c tiger meat into 6s of food, then vendor it.
---
Lmao, possible to obtain for free. About 99% people will play classic for 3 years and never see those gloves drop, do you not understand that?
---
Classic community: Only acceptable tank is Warrior, no other classes viable
---
Also, classic community: HEY GUYS ITS REALLY IMPORTANT TO TOP DAMAGE METERS ON 15 YEAR OLD CONTENT, GONNA BE A CHAD AND ROLL FLAVOR OF THE MONTH! TANK? FUCK NO!
---
I hope not, since the ranks are based on the factions actual ranks. 
---
Adding something like that would be corny. Being High Warlord or Grand Marshal is an amazing title.
---
Do you guys really think with so many people playing on each server, all already knowing the value of these twink items, that they're actually going to sell?
---
The way I see it, the ones trying to make money on it will be buying or farming what they can now, and once phase 2 hits, the value will go up, but again mainly because people want to stockpile these. 
---
Once p3 hits and bgs are a thing, I just see the market sooo oversaturated with these that undercutting will drive their value down to about what they are now. Yea there will be a ton of people thinking, but most of the twink item value came from the mass majority of players already being passed the content they would get them from. 6 months of literally everyone knowing the future value will outnumber the people who want to twink. 
---
Maybe I'm just overthinking it, but this isnt like consumable stocking, where theres going to be a constant demand, this is going to be a 1 and done for most people. Besides, won't the people planning on twinking get their gear NOW while it's cheap instead of during the madness?
---
The old 'if everywhere you go there are assholes, you're probably the asshole' technique.
---
Do you know about Portal and Looking Up?
---
Why did you .ake a post about leveing as disc but then assume 300 spell power and bis gear? Why not do the a comparison at level 40 when you get final talent points and with no spell dmg?
---
Nah, people join then bitch about it on Reddit.
---
They're just being shown leeroy jenkins video.
---
I'm a hunter, have macros, and STILL have auto attack on my bar (for my gun at least).  It sounds weird, but there are times when it actually comes in helpful- usually when a mob moves back into gun range from being in melee range, and abilities are on cooldown. The game doesn't inherently switch you back to autoing range
---
My computer would crash
---
What? That’s not what I’m talking about. It’s the “omg a girl” comment I find embarrassing.
---
Just do your thing, and the mount will come.
---
I was at 60g when I hit 40, and got the mount right before I hit 42, without changing my play in any way.
---
I am not expert but I don't think Blizzard would just say they give account back if you told them you sold it (which is against ToS). It's like you sold weed and police asks if you want them to return it to you.
---
I did notice ironforge being more active than before but I always assumed I was on some streamer layer
---
Just move to the bottom of the stairs until you see the zzz.
---
So I'd say p2 in early December, That puts it at a bit over 3 months since wow classic dropped. WSG/AV came out 8 months after wow launched so at 3 months a phase that is only a bit faster than did originally, not too crazy considering the cadence demands are difference between 2005 and 2019
---
I found that it gets considerably easier at 26 when you get cone of cold
---
So youre not intelligent enough to recognize that fishing wasnt his sole source of income? Youre just that slow?
---
The bloke is a fucking bellend the more people that fuck him over the funnier I find it
---
No. You go to the back area that looks like a deck. It’s resting there.
---
It's 2019, if someone finds 1 time you were wrong from 10 years ago then everything you've ever said is invalid
---
[I mean...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg)
---
Why should every laptop screen be the same?
---
wow so smart
---
most people were noobs in vanilla. bear tanking wasn't really a thing despite it actually being viable. This and stuff like spell cleaving dungeons is evidence of the difference between vanilla and classic. 
---
the community - as a whole - is a lot more skilled
---
I don't know why anyone who loves private servers so much won't just go back to them
---
It’s an addon issue. You can get the addon named informant to see addon lua errors. However you might just need to update a couple.
---
In raids we will be a shadowbolt turret... but leveling until then we are affliction drain tanking monsters. My personal go to is to throw up the 3 dots (until you get the life leach dot then 4) tap for mana at least once, sometimes twice, and then drain life. If you pull too much instead of tapping then skip the rest into a fear and get started on mob 2 and then on to 3. sometimes I can make 4 mobs work with the mass fear, but usually that means death. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZtEv3jSVM
---
I don't know about you, but in my guild, the GL keeps 90% of the loot in his bank and that's the way we like it.
---
&gt; as much as most people did not really consider rank 14 an achievement outside of "get a life for real!"
---
*Press X for Doubt*
---
It's an achievement. Perhaps it isn't an aspiration for many of us, but you've definitely achieved something by turning WoW PVP into a full-time job.
---
&gt; •	⁠Whatever the highest rank stun bomb you can make is
---
For this I recommend iron grenades. Throwable while moving and relatively cheap. Next grenade is a significant cost increase purely for some damage with no extra utility
---
oh stfu, this is impressive.
---
Must have really poor eyesight.
---
You should have noticed immediately if you have a proper int set.
---
It's not perfect by any means, but unlike enhancement it can easily deal with getting jumped by 1 maybe 2 extra mobs.
---
2 max rank lightning bolt + flame shock, finish off with enhanced 1h and shield.
---
He died doing what he loved most, living.
---
That's right! And it's about time we all got free epic mounts at lvl 20. What's the sense in us having to be slow? I also think i should be able to fight without dismounting.
---
Ok thanks i didnt know about that, you have 100% chance to get crit when you sit or just a higher chance?
---
And  i know for a fact that reckoning can at least stack charges in classic cause im using it, now i need to try if sitting does like you said, but ive seen vids of people saying it works in classic so it should, unless they are liars but i doupt it cause paladins dont lie.
---
no, stick to 2h arms. Fury is god awful for leveling and don't let this video convince you otherwise
---
As a mage you can kill about 2-3 mobs single target till your mana bar is empty. As an AOE mage you can kill an unlimited amount of mobs with the same mana bar. Well, at least as many as you can hoard together before you die. ;)
---
In the end it comes down to your preference: if you love risky, powerful style then do aoe-grinds, if you prefer safety over speed then go single target.
---
And when you are done you have let's say 4 accounts with 4 max lvl warriors? Because for me as a casual gamer I do not know what I should do with so many accounts.
---
In the end though, it wasn't in Vanilla and thus doesn't need to be added, since the whole point of Classic is to be Vanilla with as few things added as is absolutely possible. Plus, as others pointed out, Rank 14 already requires a no-life commitment anyway, anything more than that is ludicrously unnecessary. If we're going to add superfluous PvP ranks, though, I'll take my updated-character-model toggle first, thanks.
---
Why should we be at war? Because our greedy,  mentally-unstable politicians say so?
---
Great thank you!
---
Yet no one has been able to provide it....
---
Other guild leaders hate this guy!
---
Plus, that sounds like micromanaging my playtime.
---
Welcome to Classic. A lot of story lines just don't get carried forward to concluded. I don't know whether it was to leave hooks for future expansion, or just running out of time but it happens quite often. Besides this instance, another notable instance is the Missing Diplomat questline.
---
I believe they both get resolved in later expansions?
---
I mean at 22 I think you get blizzard.  You *could* do it then.  Gnolls in wetlands are about that level.  I went here and tried it and just didn't have the spell power and Mana pool to make it work.  
---
Now that I am a bit higher, cone of cold helps.  With my next dps upgrade I'll try it again.  I hope we can both make it work.  I look at the people who do it so easily and think I could do it.  Then I begin my corpse run.
---
The only piece that is even close to BiS on T1 for tanking is the Chestpiece, as it doesn't have much competition in that slot. A tank in full T1 is going to be worse off than a tank in pre-raid BiS. MUCH less dodging and way worse threat generation.  
---
A resto druid in full T1 is going to be much better off than a Druid in pre-raid BiS. Like it's not close. I get the argument you're trying to make, but unless you are only tanking and offtanking bosses in MC with subpar DPS players, you cannot realistically tank in T1 without gimping yourself. Threat is already hard enough in dungeons and the larger health pool is pretty meaningless.  
---
Like come on, a gear set focused on Intellect, Spirit, MP5, and healing is not better for Feral over Resto.
---
I just put it on them when they start to walk away so i don’t have to sacrifice damage.
---
It will pick back up in Felwood, getting to the root of the problems in Darkshore.
---
all classes get their own special racial buff.  No other class besides gnome suffers from this.  Totally not comparable.
---
Thats why i always check, i make damn sure my character's getting rested
---
Please don't join us, we all have crippling anxiety and may have to gdisband if more people want to join and we only have so much gamer girl bath water to go round. Whatever you do don't /w Plom to join this terrible guild.
---
Up to 10 accounts now and double the income. Suck it.
---
The file I had was like 54" wide or something, about 340MB. I got it printed online but they only offered 36" wide it's too detailed to really see anything at that size.
---
You can also make a WeakAura that outputs the result of  select(4,GetNetStats())
---
TM v. South shore will likely return for the same reason that BGs are popular in that people are lazy.  Hunting down "fresh" honorable kills takes effort and time the same way that gathering professions do.  Traveling to some mindless zerg vs zerg is fairly low effort and a mindless grind which people tend to gravitate towards.

I definitely think that leveling 50-60 is going to be a lot harder in the more "accessible" zones like azshara, burning steppes/searing gorge, WPL/EPL.  Farming in general (herb/mining) is going to be harder because people of the opposite faction are going to check you since there is now incentive for them to do so. 
---
I don't believe that even on the high population servers you're going to see a lot of people flying to more remote zones like winterspring and un'goro just to farm levelers.
---
You'll run it at 60 for gear anyway. Besides you get gold too.
---
THE reason.  *You're clearly not intelligent enough to know the difference between "a" and "THE".  *You're also not intelligent enough to properly punctuate sentences.
---
Yeah, I just bought my epic mount the other day and thought about sending some gold to an alt just to have 899g99s99c for lulz on disc, I guarantee this was setup in a similar way.
---
Yeah sure, Ill see if I can figure out exactly how I had it setup. Like I said, I haven't been playing this way since I first quit, so I cant remember exactly how I had finagled it off the top of my head. Pretty sure it was a camera flip and a dual click.
---
I learned that from his video too! It also gave you a spell to use that would teleport you to your city.
---
It’d be cool if there were 4 per faction, one of each race idk just a thought.
---
Sell your gear :)
---
I’m 42 with 5.5 days played because I’ve been hanging out, helping friends, and generally going slow. I’ve played a ton. I’d bet a casual is early 30s
---
I paid 320 for my set, Stalagg Horde.
---
Maybe to a member of the wHorde.
---
Not a bad idea. I thought about writing quest objective: have a good birthday. You will receive rewards: cake but thought it was too simple.
---
Eyyy Blackbear nice to see you on reddit! This was our guild run this week everyone was amazed seeing the eye this early!
---
Wasn’t even a BOE? Is he retarded or?
---
And end up as her 986675789th enslaved soul?
---
Nah you're good in my book. Who cares what people watch for entertainment to unwind, etc. 
---
Keep doing what you do
---
Just have fun playing the game and be social. You’ll get drops along the way just by doing stuff with other people. A little research into what items would be good for your class with help, but remember to have fun and don’t stress the minor stuff unless you’re joining a hardcore tryhard guild. That’s when it can become toxic.
---
What is the addon that tells you to use battle shout and shows you your trinkets !!!! I need this addon in my life !!!!!
---
Thanks for the vid will def check it out i have issues of dying sometimes
---
I agree it sucks but everyone is forgetting how private servers worked. Yeah it didn’t freeze like retail but it would be unplayable half of the time. You literaly couldn’t autoattack half of the time, at peak hours. You couldn’t counterspell anyone because latency. Overall, retail is still a much better experience
---
or you could aoe grind, which is much faster than rogue.
---
And you have enough time to log the main before the boss kill the alt after the pull ?
---
At what level would you recommend going AoE? 26?
---
I wouldn't take Impale while leveling since it only affects yellow damage
---
Imagine that.. ignorant person thinks it’s a one sided discussion. 
---
Your perspective means nothing if it’s not grounded in reality. 
---
The reality is that shadow is one of the LEAST represented specs in HWL/GM and aside from duels, it is at best mid tier in terms of crowd control and burst ability - the two main factors in any PvP situation in WoW.
---
Sorry you’re taking it so hard.. maybe you should think before opening that sewage mouth of yours 😂
---
Release the TBC servers!
---
When the devs actually knew a bit about proper itemization.
---
Zug zug, my brother. /salute
---
If your server has a decent population, you can just use Trade channel and I believe it is global.
---
 I usually spend time at the start and/or at end of a session, in a major city. If you are the same, just toss up your item while you are banking or whatever, it costs you nothing.
---
Many of those items are probably worth more if disenchanted for their materials, maybe look into that.
---
Great, thanks so much!
---
Music preferences do not determine if a kid was raised right or not
---
Yeah, unfortunately I didn't play elves at that point(my legolas wish fulfillment phase was in earlier MMOs) and the racials didn't seem interesting.  I do agree that night elf territory is better than the other alli areas.
---
That's true, but Mages have to spec frost in MC, which is the sub-par spec and Warlocks won't get any gear till BWL release, so they are basically raiding in green +shadow damage gear till then. 
---
Additionally most other dps classes scale much better with gear than priests. So right now they are already at the bottom of DPS classes, and in the future it will get even worse. Naxx numbers from private servers show something like 500 dps for shadow priests vs 1500 dps for fire mages.
---
Sucking at gambling is like a blessing. It would be hard for me to get addicted to it because I just lose all my money right away. "Huh...well that wasn't fun at all"
---
&gt; as close to Jerry Springer as you can get for Twitch
---
Nah that'd be the RajjPatel show for sure
---
It's a reply to someone stating they did a level 30 quest at level 23, and that others have done a level 40 quest at level 30. As if anyone could do that, or even know it's a possibility.
---
Blueberry generates threat like one. Dots alone can pull off him.
---
Cause dwarves are badass. I used to play alliance and dwarves exclusively, now whenever I see dwarves as horde I show then their deserved respect!
---
Can we know this one weird trick?
---
Most laptops fit that description.
---
That's the retail succubus. You're ruining mah immursion.
---
Keep him on passive and just bind attack/return. Feels very nice once you get it down.
---
Yeah it’s fucking sad. I noticed this on the MMO Champion cess pool forums. Every single wow Eceleb is hated there by these weirdos who seem to follow every thread about them just to shit talk. It reeks of jealousy to me.
---
Right, I'm just saying layers expanded with playerbase. I've read nothing that says actual server caps have been raised when 1 persistent world exists (in other words, post layering). I said nothing of the sort about the layering abuse. I'm stating that when the playerbase was "higher than vanilla" layering was the system that supported that. We have no actual knowledge that server caps have been raised, people just think they have because they're confusing server caps pre and post layering. Blizzard has not released numbers of server caps intentionally, yet people act like it is fact that server caps were increased.
---
A few weeks? But everyone is 20 manning it so why not post your clear this week?
---
Oh I thought you could just change some setting like you can in Overwatch. Thanks for the info anyway, might do just that
---
Yeah but I want to then use it for something else, like distract or blind.  
---
I think the registry edit to disable it is the way to go.
---
r/thathappened
---
Tanks use fast weapons so they can dump rage with more frequent heroic strikes. You could argue that unbridled wrath favors faster weapons.
---
Guess it also depends on the server, on thalnos I also saw this happening in world and general chat regularly with multiple people.
---
They had some great names! I wish I wrote them all down. They are now our rival party. Hope to see them all again, not sure if they were a pug or not.
---
&gt;but once i lost aggro, I probably wasn't getting it back no matter what I did.
---
The hardest part was that he moved *really* fast and hit really hard.  With just one tank he'd instagib the healer the moment the tank got put to sleep...in our successful run he actually slept the MT, stunned me and nearly killed the healer, only saved by a feral charge into a growl and double maul to regain aggro.
---
Dungeons generally aren't for gold, unless everyone has outgeared them or is only going for a rare drop or two like HoJ. Loot should go MS&gt;OS&gt;greed, and it looks like all the needs here were for MS/OS.
---
I don't get mad about people needing for OS. Sure, the extra gold from a BoP blue is nice, but if your goal is gold there are other better ways to get it.
---
If you have 2 people about to pass you on threat at the same time, you can only taunt for one of them, every 2 minutes anyway.
---
Stop using straw man arguments. I’m not deciding anything, you are clearly arguing against things I haven’t said and that’s 100% on you.
---
Called capitslism. Work harder
---
I'd say people begging for free food/drink are the entitled ones. If you ask a mage for food/water, then deal with whatever he's asking for it. Sometimes, they are in the middle of something and simply don't want to conjure food/drink unless someone's offering an absurd amount.
---
It isn't worth it to make yourself. If you can snag it for cheap or get mats for someone sure but shadow wrath gear basically does everything you ever need while leveling
---
I try to always be SS'd and have a HS on me when out in the world. So that's usually a minimum of 3 to have on me. Impromptu group content usually means an extra few for summons too. I'm only 47, but after AFF I went destro and will have Shadowburn soon. At that point I might start using a pouch
---
Be careful. People are getting banned for logging in while traveling.
---
Second.
---
I only saw this particular bot 1 time, it's very obvious so it's not going to be around long.
---
This one was on Windseeker, gathering blindweed in swamp of sorrows.
---
On pagle and herod we saw lots of layer hoping, and people with alts logged out at specific resources, logging in checking and logging out.  (much more common at limited supply vendors) but did see one at a black lotus spawn. Could have just been a coincidense, they logged in there, and immediately logged out again.
---
Doesn't mean it's not fun to plan now 😉
---
It's insane that for all of classic we are going to have only 4 months of incentivized world pvp before battlegrounds ruin it?
---
Yeah but this did not.
---
True but I know they had regional bg's in vanilla eventually.  They started the game on a super late patch and cross server bg's are more of a balance patch type thing than a content patch.
---
I just hope that when bg's are released, they make people queue for them at the actual bg location instead of directly from the major cities.  Wsg for instance would be the border of barrens/ashenvale.  
---
This opens up a ton of world pvp for people who are waiting for bgs.   This is why hillsbrad and arathi often became warzones.  Queuing up from cities ruined world pvp.
---
Yep.  I mained a lock during classic, and unless I was preparing for raid, I never had more than 4 or 5.
---
You don't have to /sit in my experience
---
He’s a jackass troll and other jackass trolls like hi.
---
Modifiers exist. With mousewheel and mousebutton everyone can find 20 keybinds at least. With shift, alt, ctrl modifiers thats 80 bindings
---
&gt;Figure out a way to stop them, that is what this game is about.
---
Hmm, lemme just find more free time then a group of NEETs lmao
---
I dont know about the CD, but a 4 lvl advantage isn't much when you are a body up.  I'm lvling with my friend with the same combo, and we destroy people all over that are more than 4 lvls ahead.
---
What CD did he use?
---
TSM + make profitable consumables like elixirs, potions, ammo, etc. Consumables are the best because people keep buying them vs crafted gear which are big one time purchases for most people
---
I know how simple it is, I just don't feel like doing it lol. Not sure what part of that is unclear lol.
---
You look like a power ranger and I appreciate it
---
I mean...you shouldn't just run resto druids...that's why your healers are a mixture of shamans, priests and druids.  
---
My point is that you don't just bring druids for HoTs, we're not one trick ponies, our HoTs aren't even that efficient.
---
Or reroll the class that just destroyed you.
---
We've got a ways to go for that.
---
Somewhat related so I figured I’d post it here
---
Tauren’s can’t ride undead horses no matter their rep, their fat cow bodies will break the brittle bones of the skeletal horses. 
---
And only Gnomes and Dwarves can ride robot chickens because Humans and Night elves just can’t fit in them I guess lol
---
Correct.
---
I wish! I'm paying for 2 x 6 months subs haha.
---
I don't think that gives honor points though?
---
It's weird to me that people assume WoW accounts are worthless. I wouldn't buy one because I would be afraid of it being banned, but if they weren't against the ToS I would certainly do it to save time. 
---
FFXI relic accounts would bring $5,000+ back in the 2006-2009 era. $400 for a decent WoW account is pocket change.
---
Spec feral and bear tank dungeons. There's always a huge demand for tanks.
---
I was glued to my screen with all that ninja stuff.  It's prime level entertainment.  Asmo absolutely knows what he's doing in terms of providing content for viewers.  You don't just stumble into an average 50-60k total stream.
---
Only train needed skills, only run gathering professions then power level another profession at 60, etc etc.
---
They work you're just ignoring them lol
---
Recklessness is a hell of a drug
---
Not grouping with them in the future is fine.  But getting angry and refusing to heal them, possibly to the detriment of the group is a poor attitude.
---
My Dell Inspiron 15 7000 is great! I carry it everywhere and play everywhere I can. At work, at the library, in my car.

I don't get what this means

---
weakauras can do this for you and will take 2 minutes to set up.
---
I've played ranged, a resto shaman, and a tank through instanced content.
---
Let me tell you, the comparison is night and day for the experience.
---
Tanking is much more interactive; and exhilarating.  Not just because you call the shots or because "it's all on you".  Because it isn't, and doesn't have to be.  You may want it to be eventually, but you can ease into that role as you get more accustomed to it.
---
You can have someone else mark your mobs.  You can have the hunter pull (although I personally wouldn't).  You can have someone else tell you where to go.
---
If you're new to the instance, it's ok to say so.  It's okay to ask if someone else can mark.  Here's a few pointers on how to successfully tank:
---
1.  Know who your healer is, and pull on their mana.  After a successful pull, check their mana.  You'll know if you can pull the next pack by how much they used in the previous iteration.  I always go 2X.  Repeat this every so often because mobs will hit harder, packs will have more...  the further in you go.  So if a healer used 1/3 their mana pool on a pull and everyone is alive; the bottom limit for pulling is about 2/3 (2 times what they'll probably use next pull).  
---
2. Take some criticism; some people won't be the most polite about it, but they'll have a nugget of useful information in outburst.  For instance, I forgot about LOSing Arugal in Shadowfang Keep, and we wiped.  One of the party members did the "Fucks sakes, you need to jump behind a wall to break LOS when he starts casting, dumbass!"  And they're right.  I did.  And I forgot.  I owned it, and we moved on.  More abusive than that, or not constructive:  Ignore them.
---
Based on a lot posts on this sub surprised someone did ask how much you needed and said "lol get fucked noob!"
---
Apparently logging in from a different region triggers WoW's anti-cheating system. It comes up as possible "account sharing" and looks like someone using leveling services. There's been quite a few posts of people who were playing while on vacation or logged in while on vacation in Europe and got a 30 day ban because of it.
---
So... you used a bunch of instant cast aoes
---
The only time I really watched Asmon was during the classic beta and now that classic is out I haven't watched a single stream of anyone. I do remember him once saying that half of his fanbase who comes to watch him come specifically because they hate him and many of them stick around to keep hating on him. Asmongold is basically the twitch gamer equivalent to The Jerry Springer Show.
---
OP: Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer and then all caps the person who replied...?
---
I thought it was cause they felt the riding changes were more for prep for TBC.
---
The whole thing or just armory?
---
You do know that not all rap is trash?
---
Many songs actually have strong messages.
---
Maybe you are listening to main stream rap.
---
Maybe you wasnt raised right or you would be open to diferent stuff.
---
And no. I dont wear a white cap neither a rap fan.
---
I meant average in terms of his skill level -- not personality.
---
Although I do think his personality is fairly close to average too.
---
Rock &gt; Scissors &gt; Paper &gt; Rock
---
I'm not gonna agree with you in the pve side cause shadow still does more dps. If the fights lasted way longer maybe but they dont. Also you said it scaled better with gear but that's not relevant through 80% of the leveling process. 
---
Most people who really looked into priests and theory crafting during leveling will agree that disc is better before level 40 cause you need shadow form before shadow spec is efficient anyway.
---
One of my favorite things about playing a priest is coming across random dead horde friends and rezing them.
---
well, maybe I should change the subject, actually I don't care about whether or not totems have mana. I just want to figure out how I was sent fly by Rag, but anyway, thanks to both of you for answering my question.
---
thx;  what professions are best for mage?   can she do mining ok?
---
Still, the point is that it occupies space.
---
How much it is i don't know, i am only guessing the person above.
---
Every dungeon goes 100% smoother if three very simple things are done. 
---
1) Let the tank snag aggro, and if you pull a mob, don't keep dpsing that mob, target a different one in the pack or cease all damage altogether. 
---
2) Mark the kill order and cc of you're using it. A simple skull and cross is all it usually takes. 
---
3) Follow the Marks. If everyone invests in getting single targets down faster (unless you're specifically cleaving, which is a whole other topic) the chances of things going awry falls dramatically. 
---
I was in a group the other night doing SM Cath and we made it up to cathedral doors fine, I was marking the kill order, just a skull most times. No one was complaining, seemed to be following the skull pretty well. Smooth run. 
---
Well. Shit happens and we aggroed three packs inside the cathedral and the tank pulled them out onto the steps. I marked a kill order on the healers first and it was like all of a sudden everybody decided to start dpsing their own marked mob. Tank wasn't even focusing skull. So we manage to get it down to 4 or 5 mobs, still no one focusing anything in particular, just wailing on us, everyone's oom. I had previously soulstoned the healer, so wipe was fine-ish. But we died to healers I had originally marked chain healing each other and the remaining melee mobs. I had about twice the damage done to the next person up the list. 
---
Say something in chat about please following the kill order and not taking your own mob as a dps challenge and they flipped their shit. Healer also dispelled my soulstoned for some reason so we got to make the short spirit run back to our bodies. Called me rude and all kinds of shit. I had typed two sentences. 
---
"Please follow the kill order"
---
"Don't take your own mob as a personal dps challenge"
---
I wish I had screenshotted it because they were so upset I thought they might legitimately try to message my GM or some shit. Nothing ever came of it and I added the names to my ignore but my point is dungeons are very easy with a minimal amount of cooperation. Three easy bullet points.
---
Seeing dead players outside of pvp is one of those little touches in classic that i did not even know i missed until i played classic.
---
Any Asmongold content, good or bad, only benefits him. Like one of his guild officers ninja looting the bracers last week - they had a mock trial in Westfall and his view count for that was way higher than normal. It's all just marketing and promotion and everybody falls for it. I wouldn't be surprised if he's a completely different person IRL and is only a douchbag when streaming for the clickbait drama content that he profits from.
---
This is no different, I bet when he got killed in this video he was thinking "I better look upset for the stream, then it'll get posted to reddit and I'll get more exposure, more viewers, and more Twitch subs".
---
Shhhhh
---
&gt;I don't know why you've brought up skill though, being casual or not has little baring on that.
---
I brought it up because casual isn't inherently a bad thing.
---
You associated it with unprepared and unreliable, a very negative connotation.
---
My server it's pretty balanced best of all pvp servers
---
Hey Xen. This is Runis. Congrats on the kill!
---
Because their account sharing policy is lazy and their customer service is awful.
---
It's called TSM sniper. It doesn't automatically buy it for you. What it does is constantly scan the newest products posted to the AH that meet some criteria you define, ie below vendor sale price or below average market value. Someone has to be there to press buyout on the item though. This can be done a lot faster than someone is usually able to cancel their auction
---
Shit I’m going to visit my buy an play with him all weekend I guess I risk it? That’s whack though
---
It's pretty common to get WW axe at level 30. You shouldn't go off on somebody like this because you are out of the loop, adapt.
---
How do I know when my early greens are worth throwing on the auction house vs. just selling to vendors?
---
What are you blabbering about? Blizzard has specifically said that even medium pop classic realms have more players on them than the highest pop realms did in vanilla.
---
Lol I'm just posting the youtube copy pasta on older songs
---
That’s interesting.. next time go to the slaughtered lamb. It’s much safer with nothing nefarious going on.
---
Literally go outside and kill a level 4 boar and sell his meat for 6c
---
Be careful friend, 47+ will give honor to level 60s. Stay safe.
---
here's the thing though, classic progression isn't perfectly linear and also it's not at all required to farm dungeons to their fullest extent before raiding. 
---
As a priest especially you can literally step in MC/Ony the minute you find a guild/raid that will take you which may be at level 58 even. Then you raid once a week and on off days do dungeosn and other stuff.
---
I actually am pretty sure this is #NoChanges if I remember correctly.
---
Same here. The miss rate against players isn't so bad anyway and the damage is more than enough for most situations. It's especially good in Alterac Valley since there are NPCs that need killin', too.
---
You’re confused. What I actually said was private servers are not the metric for a blizzlike experience. 
---
What you read was the above statement, plus “Classic is identical to vanilla and without error.” It’s not identical to vanilla, anyone with a brain knows that. But private server experiences are not how we figure out what’s right and what isn’t.
---
Get a trackball mouse, you can rest it on the laptop itself or on a pillow. I use mine exclusively whether I am playing on the couch or a table.
---
Maybe when you grow up and get a real job you won’t whine about $90/yr. on social media. Hell, I have whiskey that I’ve paid more for.
---
Popular posts get more upvotes? I’m shocked to hear such earth shattering revelations.
---
Nope pve! And I'm pretty sure I saw it was heavy alliance as well. When I log in in the early mornings its one of the only few that are medium or high. When the others are all low pop.
---
I’d say the complete opposite. Me and a lotttt of people have been 60 for a while and there’s basically not much to do right now other than raid once a week. Phase 3 can’t come any sooner.
---
At max rank and only if the player is good. I'm by no means a good PVPer but I understand how to play my Druid effectively. The other day I was afk watching a video on my second monitor when I had a 50 undead mage attack me while I was only level 44. Maybe his mana wasnt full or something prior but I was able to kill him and end the fight on Full HP. Some people may not fully understand other classes but it was honestly a super easy fight. I thought they were over tuned as well but it's pretty clear that it doesnt matter if the player is shit (or maybe they just weren't trying?).

Cool! Do you know if there is a 13inch version? She wants it smaller and lighter if possible.
---
I am currently specced aoe and most farming spots are overcamped when both factions can get to it easily
---
But it is worth it alone for aoe dungeon groups
---
13 dollars for hours of my time 
---
Ok.
---
OPs not very bright
---
It works perfectly for me too, using it since 55 lvls without any problems
---
I dont even see where we were wrong. Doesnt it say on the spread sheet that shadow does more dmg and dps? I'm confused by this post
---
Do any of you know how much xp we get for getting the WSG items?
---
Unfortunately that doesn't really work with how I play. I'd have to get some kind of special keyboard or device. I use the numpad instead of WASD, and things get pretty weird when you use modifiers with that. Everybody's different.
---
Got the mount 20 min after dinging 40 =)
---
Have your alt learn enchanting, then post items to it for disenchanting. 
---
Enchanting mats often sell better than things like Mail Armour of Defence or Cloth Armour of Strength.
---
I hate you (but secretly love you) for putting me on to something I will now spend entire weeks trying to attain. ;)
---
Probably would’ve been faster with melee cleave lol
---
I'm not a fanboy. I haven't played retail in over 6 years.
---
I'm just saying, as someone who *literally* works in Systems Analysis, goals are missed *constantly*. IBM threw 3+ billion dollars into an automated system that would design skeleton code and they ended up selling it for a fraction.
---
The UK has wasted trillions on a subway system that sucks ass.
---
Every company misses goals. Taking Ion (a known liar, by the way) at his word is retarded.
---
Ahhh I love pissing neckbeards off
---
Yes that should be intercept! my bad
---
That Swiftthistle price though... it goes for 30s a piece on my server :p
---
That's not what "retail" means. I'm not sure what you're talking about, but to play this game, I have to pay $13/month. That's pretty straight forward. Borderlands 3 plus season pass is $100, forever. This is 150% the cost, and only for a year. It's garbage for casual players.
---
Fuck I should have sold my ff account then I had a decked out one with every spec.
---
or on the back little porch behind the innkeeper
---
And we know you’re time is worthless. So it’s a total win.
---
It's good to have a few days banked for sure, i don't wait the 10 days as i work on a few alts and they rest while i'm out on my main who's a hair away from 30 atm.
---
It's surprising how long it takes to burn through a nice build up of rest xp, i've not run out yet. One could level easily by just killing mobs. 
---
I play the alts and it seems impossible to exhaust rest xp on any of them, but cannot get any kind of seriously build up on my main. I dunno why, much of the time i'm doing non related xp leveling stuff, like rp events, wpvp, yet the second i do some questing it seems to vanish immediately.
---
Thanks.
---
I managed to find the EU post in the end.
---
Staff is not a ranged weapon.
---
This is happening way too quickly. I've been playing since launch and I'm only in the early 20's. 
---
Of course this is on 3 characters, but still.
---
RNG happens, a thread
---
I took the misspelling as a kid writing it so it was next level whoosh if done on purpose.
---
This would made the tank shortage even worse, since many have to go fury in raids. Why would they tank if they can’t roll on dps gear?
---
It helps if you cry.
---
Not sure what the problem is here. Guild is farming dungeon and invite you. Gear drops and people who need it roll need on it.
---
Is there anything you wanted for MS (or OS) that they didn't let you roll on? Sounds like you're salty because you didn't get to win any greed rolls so you could vendor items. If that's the case, YTA.
---
As you don't even mention your class or an item you actually needed (or wanted) dropping, this seems to lack enough context to say for sure.
---
Zoom in!! Lol
---
Hiring? They fired 800 employees 10 months ago when they had one of the most profitable years to date. A lot of those roles were customer service roles, specifically in the UK.
---
I don't think Alchemy stuff will sell well until you hit 60 ..and then when the PvP Honor points are released you may have better luck selling the lower tier potions for PvPers/twinks.
---
This is what I've been told countless times when asking if I should swap my skinning for alchemy.  I really want to be an alchemist but skinning is just so much more profitable until 60.
---
You would have both.  A staff in your main hand and a wand in your ranged slot.
---
Learn to use tradeskillmaster
---
No way Gyth’s Skull!
---
If you paid for the subs through PayPal you could try and refund 1 of them through PayPal, worked for me.- Sometimes Blizzard will also offer to refund if you have barely used the sub. But the PayPal thing should work regardless. I can help you if you want
---
wow, really showing your intelligence
---
- Bear tanking. Was in reference to raiding
---
- spell cleaving was highlighting one (of the many) differences between classic and vanilla
---
try to keep up.
---
I go with the smaller guys like SalvDali. Smaller and very entertaining.
---
No, no, I would love to PvP, but I just don't see the point right now. I will be killing and getting killed with the honor system, but now I just want to get to level 60.
---
If there was a honor system, indeed, I would understand all the ganking.
---
Ok you pay $60 for a game and you complete it in two months. I guess you just keep playing that game for the next 10 months and don't play anything else /s. All I can say is I havnt touched anything else since I started playing wow again.
---
You are half right, the next step in the chain is a drop from BRD. Kill the slaves outside of BRD for the next part of the chain if you can't find a group to help with the mobs inside.
---
You can say fuck, it's ok.
---
Now take off that armor and put on the dress
---
It can sell for some extra gold on RP servers.
---
Shadow spell damage buff, melee resistance, turns you smokey purple, what's not to love
---
I retired so that I can play all day every day, if I choose.
---
This was the laziest troll and you got so many people riled up.
---
You get rested on the stairs to the upper level out back, and in the upper level.
---
Either way you see it why, in your mind, is the warrior who already purchased them (or anyone else in the group for that matter) obligated to pass on the gloves?
---
I can read, thanks. You didn't mention your skill in "making gold per hour", you simply mentioned the fact that you had the first epic mount and a lot of spare gold.
---
Maybe someone can play the AH and do way more gold than you in the span of an hour, but they won't be as rich since they play way less? Or maybe they don't stack gold or buy a mount immediately in order to invest in a long term plan or to get gear? Or maybe they aren't even 60 yet, and are still way better at making gold than you are in the long run? 
---
Having raw gold / first mount doesn't represent any sort of skill, not even the skill of "making gold per hour". Your statement is just wrong.
---
And keyboard turning / backpeddling is still bad tho.
---
Theres a separate weapon type for that, what you're looking for is a wand. By this point you should be able to pick up a lesser or greater magic wand from the ah for a good price. 
---
After you dot up your target, wanding your target down is the go to while leveling, it saves you a ton of mana from not spamming shadowbolt. It should also help your voidwalker hold theeat off you
---
Environmental storytelling
---
Yeah my gdrive has issues so I had to re upload everything. I posted it a while back if you look through my submitted history.
---
Check out this thread, he has the same issue
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dd23bl/hunter\_aimed\_shot\_auto\_shot\_clipping\_misconception/
---
Question how does a lvl 20 lock get more soul shards in azshara
---
Yeah that's very true, at least in arena or duels. Fury might do alright if you're having a massive 20v20 battle and you need to put out sustained dps, but if you're trying to kill a dude in front of you? Arms 100%. 
---
Fury has more dps, but sustained dps is easier to heal against than big burst damage. That's why fury is better for pve.  I always only played arms in vanilla though because I geared for it for pvp and would only occasionally play pve.
---
And you just proved mine.
---
Look, I could talk about how threat generation isn't wasted on bosses with adds, I could talk about how their mitigation helps them stand up better than warriors, I could talk about how gearing them out is easier and therefore they're better prepared pre-raid...there are many points I can make.
---
But I'm deferring to someone smarter than me and you're curiously refusing to educate yourself.
---
I can only presume you prefer not to know the truth.
---
They own 25% of the dungeon real estate!!!
---
They need to pay their fair share!!!
---
Fucking capitalist pigs
---
Use execute on the 1%
---
I think its pretty clear what im talking about, massive clusterfucks of pvp like this isn't fun, skillful or really entertaining.
---
Shoulders hat and tabard/chest are key.
---
ok thanks. so how do I go about using the thing?
---
If you have skinning as a hunter you're going to HAVE to loot animals a fair bit, and those are a good source of on-the-fly meat for wolves. It's still trickier than cats though, especially if you want GOOD meat to bump up happiness from death etc.
---
You know that’s a lie. You’ve “touched” other things. Hahahahaha
---
So I don't ask but I typically make off pretty well if I'm in the right place and the enchant is actually kinda good.  For example I had to do 20ish +5 strength bracer enchants.  So i flew to Feralas and started handing them out for free.  Most people didn't tip but I did get 50s a lot and on two occasions 1g.  
---
Oddly enough people seemed a lot of generous when I was offering free enchants on the org bank roof.
---
See: Goblin Sapper Charge
---
Dwarf master race
---
Im ok with people needing for off spec. But only if they ask and others dont need it. Otherwise it looks sketchy. 
---
If they actually responded like that, they knew they were in the wrong.
---
Thanks, is there a way to see the crit chance as well for the BM talent?
---
If you ever hit Like it will fuck with your algorithm regardless of how much you tell it you're not interested in the option. I had a similar problem awhile ago and found out that my Liked videos were causing it. Removed those and it fixed my algorithm.
---
I carry an entite set of caster gear for my pally, swap out the plate when Im healing
---
Either a troll or confused. We call BFA retail. Just let it be. You are paying 15$ per month for retail. Classic comes with that for free.
---
This guy calls his viewers and guild mates retards constantly everyday so thank you for this. if you didn’t roll horde to camp all low level Olympus members I feel bad for you. Missing out on a ton of fun :]
---
Staffs dont shoot. For the most part your staff will only be useful for the stats it gives you if any. Your wand equips to the small slot next to the staff which will take up the main and off hand slot. Wands are seperate from that so you need a wand not a staff to shoot.
---
The alliance side is simply easier to defend. 
---
You can hold off a larger force with less people. You can also cut off the GY access easier.
---
You can basically just waltz through the horde base no problem
---
i think this is the most downvoted post ive seen. be proud of yourself for saying something so..interesting
---
Idk if TSM works in classic but you basically get a Ah scanner addon and wait for someone to make a mistake and list an item for a very low price and buy it, resell it and make profit
---
Yeah only immature kids and adults like asmongold. I dont even watch him, I just LOVE LOVE LOVE how triggered and butthurt he makes everyone. Like just mentioning in name is enough for some people to go off on their "REEEEEEEEE ASMONGOLD REEEEE" "oNLy 15yO eDgELoRdS aND 30Yo MAN cHiLdReN" I mean look at this entire thread, buncha grown adults crying about a streamer.
---
\&gt;  Is it fun to tank? 
---
Absolutely; I ran a hunter through instances first.  After the first "wow, look at all this...." run; it was fairly mundane.  As a prot warrior, every single run was engaging, heart beating faster, etc...
---
 \&gt; How many fury warriors get to raid later on? 
---
In MC, most DPS warriors were Arms spec because MS was valuable in Sulfuron fights, and honestly, most people aren't willing to go through the level of effort to blow DPS charts out of the water.  Then it comes down to utility.  My advice if you want a slot?  Be versatile.  Have some tanking gear and be willing to off tank, then build out your gear and creep up the DPS charts.
---
\&gt;  When should I expect to feel the class is fun to know if I should continue play it? 
---
Warriors are hamstrung (pun intended) until they hit \*about\* level 25-30, then they're still a pain in the ass to level, but really start to gain some fun around level 40.  After that, it's engaging (but still slower) to level.
---
A Rogue is an under-represented class; and has several advantages that make them very viable solo and PvP players versus warriors.  At level 60; rogue slots are DPS slots, and typically the advantage falls to ranged for their mobility and higher threat cap.  But you'll never be able to chain stealth pickpocket runs of instances to buy your mount as a warrior.
---
Both are a rush to play, but for different reasons.
---
/signed
---
Riled no. Laughing at a dumb fuck? Yes. I see it as a bonus feature to the $15 a month.
---
1. It’s an herb.
---
2. classic.wowhead.com
---
And I do respect that rule...if it's announced.
---
I see the merit.
---
I'm just pointing out to the "all need" voices, that most people don't think that way, so you have to announce it.
---
I love your macro for that.
---
AH is wild.  I've been trying to bid on low priced items and get outbid again instantly.  It's hard to believe someone else is also on at 4am just bidding on *all* the same stuff I am.
---
There has to be some kind of script/automation/addon they are using
---
Or maybe, him being serious is an act.
---
&gt;  I ain't some noble Paladin.
---
Even 'noble paladins' wouldn't treat the other side to a fair fight, Or even in gurubashi. The good paladins that end up unkillable have about 8 health bars if it's a 1v1.
---
That beef is still good.
---
It depends on your perspective. I play like 200+ hours a month on average, so $13/200h = ~¢6.5/hour. I don't know any other form of fun in life that is that cheap.
---
+ healing is weak until you can stack it. Start collecting the + healing gear but I wouldn't equip it until it adds up a bit or if your other piece just doesn't give many stats.
---
What a chode, right?
---
Right. The version of himself broadcasted to tens of thousands of people daily for the sole purpose of entertainment and profit isn't the act. The version of himself speaking about the state of the country/society etc. among his friends is.
---
Didn't put much thought into that one, did you?
---
Okay, that's what I didn't know. I thought it was just for wow classic. I just wanted to casually play the old game I used to play. But not for $150/year.
---
see i'm 100% opposite of you, everyone I have ran with has come with all need on boe's. But it isn't the case for all servers. I don't need to explain the reasoning because you know. Just remember if no loot rules established and people roll need that could be how they were taught 15 years ago. Similar to my lifestyle in the midwest and what I call things is different then everywhere else. It's a tough subject, and now with the internet like it is people are finding out how different each server played the game. What a time to be alive!
---
That’s one boss
---
I stand by 2. Then
---
The first asmongold stream I ever saw was the first raid in BFA, where he had "world first" in his video title. I proceeded to watch a guild full of morons that can't listen to simple instructions, wipe repeatedly for the next few hours on the first boss, with asmongold flopping his teeth out like a beaver every 12 seconds, and making faces that made me wonder if he was in the middle of a seizure while playing, Then part way through the raid an item dropped for one of his guildies and asmongold said you're either giving that to me or giving me 150k gold. I was immediately like "this guy's a fucking loser"
---
​
---
So thank you for this, this is nice.
---
Its not the same price it was 15 years. Did you pay 60$for the base game?
---
Spirit &gt; Int &gt;= Spell Damage &gt; Healing Power
---
When you're leveling you really want as much spirit as possible for Spirit Tap unless you're really running only dungeons in which case Int and Spell Power is better.
---
you may leave now.
---
No, their policy is to give a shitcan response. That’s what happens all the time, why would you believe it’s a training issue? The CS experience with Bliz is and has been the same exact process for years: no process unless you get internet attention.
---
Im on mobile and not worried about formatting. Figured you were smart enough to understand what is being said. But go on and willfully steer off course since you were wrong.
---
I mostly dealt in enchanting materials, cloth, leather and sometimes potions. 
---
An easy ‘snipe’ was people getting the conversion rates between greater and lesser essences messed up. Buy three lesser essences for 50s, sell the greater for 2g (for example). 
---
For leather I always buy Rugged Learher for 6-7s and relist for 8. Generally in larger stacks and relist in stacks of 1 (yeah I’m that guy, sorry bois who auction manually). 
---
Major Mana Potions I typically buy for 1,5-2g ~thursday/friday and resell for atleast 1g more each on saturdays or tuesdays. Little things like that. 
---
I use Auctionator and start my game time with a full scan from my bank alt, then during the day I mail everything over that makes more than 1 silver per auction and vendor the rest on my main, and I post auctions just before bed while I brush my teeth.
---
I'd have just bought the mount first tbh
---
That's what I didn't know. I just wanted to play the classic game I used to, so i went to the classic wow site and it said i have to subscribe.
---
Thanks for explaining it and not being a dick.
---
Haha most casuals will probably never even raid! I have a family and I started classic because I loved raiding in vanilla/tbc, but I doubt I will ever have the chunk of time to dedicate to it.
---
Would you trust the reviews of a restaurant if one customer reviewed it? Probably not. Would you trust the reviews of a restaurant if it had 1000 reviews? Probably. What if of those 1000, 900 were employed to give bad reviews? 
---
Institutions don't really change and are looking for consistency. People, on the other hand, change daily so recent interactions would never be accurate, not evil.
---
I play a Mage. Hit 60 weeks ago and currently I'm raiding Ony and MC full clears for 3 weeks now. I had an AoE spec but did not use it until around 35. I leveled how I wanted, where I wanted. Sometimes I just single targetted mobs until I finished whatever I was doing, other times, like with the pirates in Tanaris, I would pull everything and aoe it down.
---
My advice? Just play the game. Do whatever strikes your fancy in the moment. If you're new to Vanilla, try to explore the game more and do as much as you can of everything; professions, dungeons, quests, grinding, whatever. If you're not new, stop trying to find the "best" thing and just do what feels good, you'll appreciate it more. There are enough points to be good at single target AND aoe, you don't have to pigeonhole yourself into one thing or the other.
---
It's a little eclectic and difficult to setup, so I'll just give you a link to a folder of all of my relevant UI mods with my customisations: http://www.filedropper.com/addonsbackup_1
---
P.S. There's a .tga file in Roth UI that I modified graphically (just to remove low-health-alert glow) so you'll have to download a replacement from the official classic Roth UI page if you preferred it on.
---
right. people forget this is the tipsout guild. there are no winners here
---
also zoomers? from what I can tel asmongolds guild seems like mostly 22+ yr olds
---
&gt; Equip Sword/Shield -&gt; Shield Bash
---
Does this macro need to be pressed twice?  Once to equip a shield, and another to use the shield bash action?
---
That's what I was thinking! It just seemed way too fast, even taking into account addons that scan the AH for you. I whispered the person asking about it (it was a level 1 bank alt) but they didn't respond.
---
Not really. I get perfectly adequate support from Amazon and Apple. No excuses Activision just needs to do better.
---
Lmao he sure has
---
Its your choice to be naive and trust random people in online game. "Havent seen" doesnt mean you didnt played with one in group..
---
Even if we exclude abusing trick how about my first statement ? Whats the point of well geared player joining random group? And whats the point of trading/AH system in wow if buying gear actually puts you in dissadvatage?
---
The XP rested range is bugged. It's placed slightly above the floor so you either need to stand on the hammock or go to the 2nd floor.
---
Nice! Grats!
---
This is what gaming is supposed to feel like and grats means something again.
---
Super pet peeve as i'm not some Grinch or anything and its nice, but modern mmorpg's the grats overload rubbed me the wrong way.
---
Grats for everything ffs, why level5, 10, 15 really? even 20, 100, the only grats should be for rare drop or capping, everything else was handed to you during your empty experience and maybe all the grats were meant to fill the void of zero satisfaction?
---
I dunno, but it's F'ING NICE TO SAY....
---
GRATS MAN!!!
---
...and mean it, as it means something again :)
---
Uhm ... how about no? You don't get to pick favorites, sir. You don't get to decide to NEED an item and cherry pick which group member is your dearest friend and give it to him. If it's equipment and you don't actually need it, then hit GREED. What you're proposing would only result in massive drama and the disbanding of your group.
---
This is the right answer.
---
Ive gotten to the point where i dont even have HS on my actionbar anymore. If i need to dump rage i just use MS.
---
Sunder for days.
---
streamers make content for the games we like so people share the content when fun stuff happens. idk why you think this shouldn't be allowed, it's a video of a guy playing wow classic in a wow classic sub
---
That’s an interesting way to do it. I suppose the mount is only faster on far distances
---
If your tank is not using gift of arthas in a raid, he's doing it wrong.
---
But smaller head would make difficult to create skull with all the details. But, hey, whole thing may be bigger. A lot bigger ;p we just need customer :D we love making stained glass but it is rather expensive hobby and we don't have more room in our home xD 
---
Thank you!!
---
Why is this a 'rush' though? Why is it a problem that more content exists?
---
I honestly wasn't trolling. I didn't realize it was for the other wow game, too. I just wanted to casually play classic wow a couple hours a week, maybe. But not for $150/year.
---
Most people dont really use it but its a pretty good potion. Only useful on tanks though since they should be the ones getting hit. I used it in dungeon runs on my pally whenever i tanked on private servers. Good for leveling if you can get it cheap if youre a melee class.
---
Yep. I have an owl now but have been considering switching to a bat (basically just trading claw for bite). But their diet is a bit more restrictive lol
---
Fuckin Eastern Plaguelands judge
---
Yeah yeah, it’s not just for one game. They state it’s an active subscription to WoW that will gain you access to classic servers in addition to the live retail version. You don’t even need to have purchased the latest expansion of the game! Just have a sub to wow. :)
---
My rogue's name is Loudfart on on of the RPPVP servers. A couple days played and I haven't been forced to change my name. But you see, it IS a roleplaying name. I /fart on people before I gank them. 
---
"Loudfart brushes up against you and farts loudly"
---
It’s making more and being played more than retail.
---
I think this cannibalizes retail in 2 years
---
you have gonnorhea, from fucking kobolds.
---
Sounds about right
---
Yes pvp is great and all but taking that boat usually ends up being slower for me than flying the long way to the other boat.
---
Everyone is just responding to your attitude
---
I was venting after the situation I described happened to me lol.
---
I like to go by the dollar per hour rule. A few hours a week, so let's say 4 hours a week. 4x4 is 16. 16 hours a month for $13. I pay $60 for games that I only play 12 hours of
---
What about healers? As a holy priest i cant farm shit by myself and get nothing from guild but tanks get everything free. They have a fucking sweet deal if you ask me
---
sell the hearthstone there is no way back :D
---
Maybe you are just parenting better!
---
Imagine you have a tank who refuses to use taunt, revenge, or sunder, because they don't like those skills for whatever reason. Yes, you have to adapt to their playstyle when running with them, but it doesn't make them any less of a noob for refusing to learn how to improve their play.
---
This is the exact same thing. The guy was given a wonderful skill sequence to rapidly build threat. He refused to learn it (in a hostile way, no less), because he is the tank, and people should be adapting to him anyway.
---
Lol i got 76g at level 47 but I dungeon farm to level
---
Yup, staffs and daggers (you can also use swords but so few are itemized for casters) are really there just for the stats. Melee is a last resort or for humiliation. 
---
Not really related, but another helpful thing is macros, you can google specific warlock ones for more complex ones, but this is one I cant live without. Using this will send your pet to attack at the same time as casting your opening spell. I like to bind this to shift-mousewheel up
---
/cast Curse of Agony (or any spell you want, but curses typically start with the least threat)
---
You can also make another one for calling your pet back when you see it doing something stupid, I like to put this on shift-mousewheel down
---
/petfollow
---
/petpassive
---
Forgive my info if you already know it, I'm bored at work lol.
---
&gt; So they worth ~1% hit chance for orcs/humans + 10% glancing blow reduction.
---
Incorrect because ~~There is no hit rating less than 1% on any item in wow.~~  Edgemasters on a weapon specialization race would only reduce glancing blows for their specific weapon by 10%.  Which is not good for a glove slot.
---
It's just they won't say no... Because of the implication
---
Think itll take you another 120 hours to go up 6 levels?
---
*felhunter looks offended*
---
How do my you check your crit %?
---
Shit... probably started mine during the middle of August and I’m only level 37 now lol
---
I actually paid $100 for a very replayable game and all its DLC. BL3 will last me a LOT longer than 2 months. And I'll replay it for a lot longer than 9 months, which is what $100 gets me of wow.
---
Is it possible not enough people know about it? I would think with these new 10k+ servers there would be constant needs for summons
---
I guess your evil deed is not using the print screen button
---
I forgot about paladins! That horde bias showing
---
No problem. This game can be a trial to learn for the first time. I also play a warlock. A good choice. Have fun!
---
40 but at 39 sold some twink gear for about 20 gold, a bunch of ticc leather, cloth, and like 10-15 pairs of dark leather shoulders i was selling for about 1 gold 25 silver each probably had 55ish gold when i dinged 39 then 100 gold at 40, i definitely slowed down my levelling so i could get it at 40 tho lol.
---
Improved Regrowth only affects the direct heal, not the HoT. And Swiftmend is also a direct heal, not a HoT.
---
I am new to macros and I started with one yesterday and I can’t wait to learn/apply more
---
It puts charge and hamstring on the same keybind cause you can’t charge them if you can hamstring them and if you can hamstring them you can’t charge them!
---
Just a simple macro like this has opened my eyes to lots more but I am easing my way into it as I like to learn and make changes to my UI/keybinds progressively VS all at once
---
Well that’s probably because you have some sort of social deficiency where you still believe insults or cussing = anger.  
---
You’re being a fucking dumb dumb so I called you a fuckin dumb dumb.  That’s all there is to it bud
---
Tell that to the runecloth bag recipe
---
So: I was offering a different perspective.
---
I never implied it was some grand awesome thing.
---
I was an ass and now everybody knows it.
---
"You may think you want it, but you actually don't"
---
Kinda puzzles me how people aren't getting their mounts at 40. Why bother buying gear off the AH that you are just going to replace in a few levels?
---
I mean 15 days is 360 hours and I'm not sure I'm so inefficient that I've wasted over 60 hours. A few hundred hours doesn't seem unreasonable.
---
[When you're right, you're right](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7770/winkey#comments). This is so cool, like tiem capsule deja vu in a way 
---
From the comments on Winkey the gnomish pirate:
---
&gt;She doesn't START or END a quest..and doesn't appear to be in the MIDDLE of any quests.  If there is another npc that mentions her it could be implimented later in the game, but for NOW, she serves NO PURPOSE!
---
And another guy 14 years ago having the same thought you just did.
---
&gt;She sits on an island and looks like a gnomish pirate, doesn't seem to do anything.  A dwarf in Burning Steppes says "I'll kill you, Winkey!" a lot, and sometimes he talks like a pirate.  Any corrolation?
---
could be im slow af
---
OP probably eats out all the time and complain about 13 bucks for unlimited playing time
---
Pretty sure the reason weaponswingtimer is not 100% accurate is spell batching.
---
How do you not have at least one bank alt?
---
That's normal, it really picks up after 35.
---
Then you can't beat them, guess you get to pay their price for devilsaur and realize it's part of the game.
---
This is the only Tailoring pattern that my character knows that's consistently profitable to vendor. On my server there are similar opportunities in Cooking, but with a lot less cheap supply of materials.
---
There is a greed button for trivial items, or for playing with people you trust.  If you want to click greed and have someone else roll need then you cry about it, that's on you.  
---
If you're a twink, it's pretty unlikely that you're going to be in sfk on said twink.  If you WERE to actually be in sfk, well then you can roll need against the 4 others.  Besides, if you're twinking, it's pretty implied that you have a higher level main which you could farm these BoEs with instead of wasting time in there on your twink.
---
Sorry, but I need that gold just as much as you need the item.
---
These are too easy to fake, click your gold number in backpack and pickup any amount to show pretty number.
---
Post to reddit for karma
---
Profit!
---
Sorry I'm a mage; for me it was more the lack of communication and what the party leader said the moment I joined. I'm all for needing for OS and if I didn't clarify that I will do that now. It's just more the way they went about it and my perception from being the 1 Random in the dungeon group. It came across as a bit shady. Just say "hey I'm needing for offspec" that's totally cool. Some of us aren't super connected with our guilds and do rely on vendoring items to make money. So yes after 3 hours with one group and winning literally nothing I was a bit salty, is that an atypical reaction?
---
Well, the target demographic for camgirls is supposedly a *bit* older.
---
private servers were better
---
You might be jobless, spouseless, and friendless. But I have all 3. So, it's not as many hours for me per month ad you might think. To contrast, I paid $100 for borderlands 3 and all dlc. It will last me a hell of a lot longer than 9 months.
---
That's fine if it's what you would prefer. But in absolutely no way does it lend credit to your argument, and it's clear that you lack the intelligence to be convinced otherwise.
---
have you seen his girlfriend?
---
That, and that quillboars aren’t kobolds.
---
Value is up to the person.   It is also not a factor in the need/greed loot system.   As for will they equip it,   rule we had was they had to equip it after winning it.  If they didn't it was treated as a ninja.  Not perfect but about as good as  you can do while still working within the games need/greed system.    Rolling need and not using it is one way to ninja,  rolling for an item that you can't or won't use and is not an upgrade is another.
---
Because no one else needs tank gear in the group as their primary spec. By default, it goes to the tank player unless they accepted someone who declared they were rolling purely on tank gear. Which basically never happens, because as you said tank shortage.
---
It actually works out just fine.
---
WoW has been $15 since it came out, not counting for inflation you are saving money since Vanilla. What's the problem?
---
I think that's just part of how casting works in vanilla. Like when mounting you can start moving when the bar is ~90% and the mount will still go off. I think addons like Quartz tell you when your cast will *actually* finish, according to latency or whatever. I'm not sure any swing timer addon will be or could be totally accurate
---
With how heroic strike functions dual wielding you’re going to want to use two 1h even if you’re horde.
---
Not Out yet?
---
That's pretty neat.
---
I had a group where we agreed if someone rolls 69 then they auto-win, now my friends and I follow it all the time.
---
Go to STV and kill the gators south of grom'gol at the shore line. They drop grey stuff you can vendor for ~7g/h
---
NS was the last talent I filled. It's nice in clutch situations but healing without NS teaches you to be better at predicting who to heal.
---
People are leveling using gathering professions to farm gold and for the most part are probably waiting to level up crafting professions until their main has an epic mount.  
---
Once a decent amount of people have a 60 main with an epic mount I think we’ll see mat prices go up because people will be leveling professions on an alt or their main.
---
So am I going to need 90 gold total for the mount and training?
---
Or will the mount be 90g and training 10g?
---
Most of my BiS gear is leather but screw that. I'm wearing plate like I'm suppose to. Don't care about min/maxing too much.
---
You have to report names. Blizzard doesn't take action on their own, but will act on reports from the players.
---
I thought this as well. I will probably have to have another go. Sad thing is my priest friend is now 25. Sad day.
---
At least it didn't go to a paladin.
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
Get this clickbait trash out of the subreddit
---
Pretty sure retail is still the same, you get 1 kill of each raid boss a week
---
You can only join a single MC instance per week. Onyxia you can do two instances per week.
---
If you join a raid that has an active instance, you are locked to that instance until it resets for you.
---
Just don't do what I did blow your was trying to play the ah.
---
How do you tell go to retail in orc? Thanks in advance
---
that would be death for this game if they waited 4 more months before BG's
---
I know it’s probably low hp, but would the dog whistle from Sm be useful for this?
---
I believe that gives you shadow protection,  if I’m correct toons use on 1st phase of nef when he shoots shadow bolts.    Also can be used on twins in AQ40
---
I got second wind yesterday finally :)
---
A movie at a movie theatre is more than 13 dollars. Can you play 3 hours a month?
---
The thing I heard about threat meter is everyone in the party needs the add-on since this is classic and certain features for threat are limited.
---
I'm a gnome.  I had no issue getting to honored.  I did Dun Morogh, Westfall, Redridge, and Duskwood entirely, a little bit of Loch Modan.  Seems pretty typical for most Alliance.
---
If you go to Darkshore and Ashenvale then I understand.
---
Oh no, you just had an evil twin created.  
---
You're still the good one! 
---
Oh god, he's created two evil parts.
---
Don't do it. Period. 
---
It's douchey. You aren't entitled to any items over the other people in your group. 
---
This trend is becoming completely out of hand and needs to stop. Almost every group spam on Herod has something reserved and they spam for an hour because nobody wants to join their shitty greedy group.
---
That was my original plan. I bought warden staff and everything. I still plan on building that set in later patches
---
I've been rat holeing away every single one for a while waiting for battlegrounds and free action potions since I'm alchemy.
---
O meu primeiro char era Paulo que é o meu primeiro nome, portanto achei apropriado fazê-lo no Classic. Contudo era um warrior.
---
That’s where I’m logged out right now.
---
Stances/(some)Interrupts/Racials are on independent cooldowns.
---
The level of intelligence is evidenced in your creation of this post and subsequent arguments.
---
If they have the appropriate reputation. Players that level to 60 via AoE farming are going to have to do many quests/runecloth turn ins to hit the discount available for honored.
---
Basically a 900G mount turns into a 810G mount for honored with the faction. There is probably some room for profit here and there, but I expect that this particular flip isn't going to sell through quickly.
---
Also shazzrah, baron, golemagg , magmadar...  all those bosses require less effort with more ranged classes.  
---
“ one boss “ right .....
---
With the amount of curses and dispels needed, i knw why you needed so many mages
---
Start with Sunders but use revenge every time it is off cooldown. If my target has no sunders but I have aggro, I'll sunder it. I usually pay sunder till i have 1,000 threat but use revenge each time it is off CD. If my mages are casting a pyro blast or my hunters are doing an aimed shot I'll make sure I have 30 rage for a shield slam to match their spike in threat. 
---
When I have 5 stacks of sunder on a target as well as top threat i will save my rage so that i always have 30. So I'll save my rage until I have 80 or so then rotate between shield slam and revenge, saving enough rage to swap stance to berserk and intercept to a target I may have lost threat on
---
No it still applies threat
---
Is it to the healer or AOE DPS?  If its APE DPS, then I’d suggest sunder once on everything, if it’s the healer, that’s what taunt is for.  Possibly the healer is going a bit early. And needs to wait 1 more sec
---
I should have mentioned that. I am mostly running dungeons. Sounds like the +healing is a better option. Thank you.
---
People think this is funny?
---
It’s when you join and not when you actually enter the instance?
---
idgaf what min-maxers today do, I want to play the game the way it was meant to be played.
---
Yeah they are devilsaur mafia 100%
---
10-4, thank you.
---
Legend said that three hams would kill him.
---
As soon as you are in a MC instance with at least 1 dead boss you get locked even if you weren't present for the kills of the boss.
---
It is not a waste and is your primary threat builder when  revenge is on CD
---
It's amazing how toxic people are toward Asmongold.  Here I am calling him average skilled and you feel the need to go out of your way to shit on him lol.
---
I am mostly running dungeons.
---
Where do you live were it's only $13?
---
Serious answer: Blizzard mutilated the game and drove streamers away.
---
A long time ago, reckful and later sodapoppin were the king of WoW streamers and this persisted through MoP. Those guys were who you tuned in to watch play WoW. Then came WoD, reckful got banned and soda got disillusioned with PvP and both went to other games and WoD really was void of prominent WoW streamers. Legion came, Asmon started streaming and gained a small following. Gradually, I think in part to showing the non-pvp side of WoW and in larger part due to his disgusting hygiene, his audience grew throughout Legion and carried him into BfA. He himself became disillusioned with BfA and tried to go variety, which failed spectacularly and caused him to gain even more viewers. After a short break, Asmon announced his return to WoW and shortly after came beta and because he spent the past few years being the #1 WoW streamer when people tuned in for beta many simply clicked on the first person they saw streaming it and his audience continued to grow. 
---
Blizzard tearing the game apart drove away its most popular streamers and from that void came Asmon.
---
I've been trying this for 10 years with no luck.
---
Robe of winter night is pre raid BIS (and beyond) for warlocks and shadow priests. Its a BOP pattern from Cobalt Mageweavers in Winterspring. I can buy the mats for it off the AH for around 50g and sell the robe for around 130-150g. Good profit margins. The drop rate is not great and they are elites that drop it so might take a while to get the pattern.
---
I mean they didn't need for OS on any items you needed so I don't see the problem?
---
Two out of three bgs come in phase 3.
---
Right; "main spec" isn't always the one they are playing it's the spec that they are going to roll for. But what it sounds like from OP's run, people were only rolling on gear no one else needed, maybe I misread.
---
No. Cross-realm battlegrounds were implemented in 1.12, so that’s what we get.
---
Anyone else need an adult
---
Got mine at 40. I was lucky.
---
Paladin so instant, queue the downvotes.
---
Just responding to clarify since people are making  the argument that a racial mount should be farmed instead. The warlock epic mount requires q shot load of herbs, enchanting mats, gold, etc. For many warlocks this is in fact just as expensive as another racial epic mount, but the warlock epic mount is way cooler and exclusive. The mats required will take quite a lot of time to gather so that why I recommended the OP start in P1.
---
people hate asmon so much they are indirectly defending absolute scum guilds like clc stream sniping and colluding, wild
---
It does on the back little platform behind the Innkeeper
---
Prove your in russia right now
---
I get the same but I assume it’s just latency or batching; similar to how you can jump just before the end of a heal cast and it will still go off.
---
All of those players were pro/high ELO streamers at some point which is what got them their viewerbase and start.  Asmon is a very average video game player which was my original point.
---
No need for [nostance:2] here since casting Defensive Stance if you are already in it won't do anything, you'd just save yourself 12 of those precious 255 character by removing it.
---
Where was I wrong? He said fishing is the reason he has 60g right now. All I said was that was what he said. Which it was. Which makes me correct. No one is bullying him. They are literally interpreting what he said as he said it. Just accept that you will not earn 60 gold an hour fishing at level 29.
---
Yeah you have travel form. One of them was server first 60 with travel form. The other was in the top 25.
---
Were all in different tax brackets. You teLl which one this guys fall in.
---
[Insert circlejerk comment to pander to the neckbeards of r/classicwow]
---
jack of all trades, master of none.
---
same warrior got kited to death by a 43 hunter 2min later
---
How exactly is a patch which literally adds no difficult end game content catering to "try hards?"
---
And why would you be upset that people are getting things added to the game to make it more fun for them?
---
Misinformation 
---
On retail you can join anyone's raid and help them kill bosses that you are locked from you just cant collect loot. Except for mythic but even there a confirmation warning comes up after you enter the raid asking you if you want to lock yourself to that lockout. There is no warning in classic
---
Well ret does more DPS than a holy paladin. 
---
I could see an argument being made for bringing a 21/8/22 or 21/0/30 paladin and let them flex between healing and DPS. But yeah, I was just trying to point out what they bring in return for doing much less damage than a warrior.
---
Lenovo Thinkpad might work
---
War is hell ain't it!
---
jus floating combat text, those are all settings you can adjust in the regular blizzard interface
---
No, it isn't. You don't need to be exalted to buy your own races mount, so someone with exalted can buy it for you for cheaper. There is also a pvp rank discount that can make buying it cheaper.
---
Refer to my previous comment
---
&gt;Just because its more useful for someone else, doesnt mean the warrior cant have it
---
I've had this happen before, too. I imagine it is one of those unbelievably rare things that just kind of happens, unfortunately.
---
Never had a connection issue and have done tons of pvp
---
Check every trade person you see and every inn back in the kitchen. You'll find quite a few but theres still fish I can't cook and i'm at 225 on almost all my professions til I get 35
---
That's really fucking cool, thanks!
---
Imagine how bad arenas would be if there were still spells like this.
---
One option is to redirect the NumLock to a different basically unused key combo via AutoHotKey script. If you actually want to toggle numlock, using a modifier like shift will work around the AHK script but still activate NumLock.
---
Not exactly an easy fix compared to the other option linked, but it does exist.
---
Right. I don't buy new games that frequently. I buy a new game about once a year. This year, it was Borderlands 3. in previous years it was  Dragon Age and Mass Effect. Both of those games lasted me a year, at least. Incredible value for $60.
---
This BL3 plus dlc for $100 will past me until the next dragon age comes out. Other than that, I have free AAA games I got for free, like metal gear and call of duty to keep me busy if i want a break.
---
So, you're right. It's not terrible. I just have a lower threshold for dollar per hour I'm willing to pay.
---
Plus, I didn't realize that you get 2 games with it. They basically just added classic as an option in addition to the regular wow game. I just wanted to casually play classic wow a little, not dedicate hours and hours to it.
---
For non-single the opening would be charge, tc, demo, def stance, shield block, rev, sunder?
---
True, but they will review appeals. A semi-automatic system is better than no system at all.
---
What I’m saying is that you need two tanks in MC specced prot with a tanking set. Then you need like 2 more dps who are ready to taunt and tank in case. So you need 2-4 tanks per 40 mans in raids but for 40 ppl to run 5 mans you need 8 tanks. Many people tanking 5 mans right now have no intention of tanking in raids because there is no need for them but dungeons need tanks so they fill that role. If they couldn’t roll on dps gear it would be pointless for them to tank 5 mans. The small pool of people willing to tank end game 5 mans would be cut in half. This is much worse imo than tanks rolling on dps gear.
---
No it's when you enter the instance
---
&gt; That instance takes like 2 hours with a regular group
---
What are you taking an hour for lunch and your 15 minute smoke break?
---
Yah I know.. internet is always right I'm an idiot.. just down vote and be done with it.
---
The game has only been live for 5 weeks. How many "weeks" have you cleared MC to start complaining that you aren't seeing specific gear?
---
When you've been farming for ***months*** and specific items haven't been dropping, then come and complain . . .
---
8 Netherwind Pants would be better. Still leaving one of our mages without pants though.
---
As I said in my reply directly to OP: That reply is suspicious and defensive as fuck if they weren't actually trying to dick him over.
---
If u haven't decided yet if say pally. I'm able to start hitting a mob go brew coffee, pour it up and get back right on time for the next pull.
---
How why
---
At least he can open a ticket and get it back. Holy shit.
---
Overreacting by creating a reddit post about it.
---
Why respond?
---
Raided heavily as a holy priest for a long time...... Prot wars have work to do, I'm not denying it.  I couldn't say if farming as holy/disc is harder than a prot warr, but I'd say its comparable.  Why do you not have to put in the work like everyone else?  **because its too hard**  is all I'm hearing...
---
Always sucks when that happens.  But keep raiding every week and the gear will slowly but surely find its way into your hands!
---
Yeh I spent 100$ on destiny 2 doesn’t matter if the games built on a service model for me fps games get boring fast.
---
Heartseeker+bonescraper
---
Does anyone have a spreadsheet of all the things to do when you hit 60? I remember there being one going around for bfa that told you necessary rep farming and what to grind out to get ready for raiding.
---
The more detail the better!
---
Northrend's there. They are the 4 little islands in the north. Yes, that's the original Northrend.
---
kill them. kill as many as you can. bring me their tusks, and we will celebrate their deaths together.
---
Omg there’s a server called Mankrik?
---
Fuck I have to reroll
---
&gt;no process unless you get internet attention.
---
You are literally describing what happens when an understaffed CS department has to meet quotas. It's not exactly rare, and no, this wasn't what you got years ago.
---
So in classic can you loot rag more than once a week?
---
Disagree. If you were smart you'd have already been running BRD since lvl 52. I lived in LBRS/BRD for my pre raid BIS all the way to 60 from low 50s. 
---
Feels good to ding 60 and already have 50% or more of your pre raid BiS or non-green gear in general.
---
Multiple people are saying contact blizzard and let them know you'll be traveling. While that might do something, remember it's an automated system that is handing out the bans. I doubt they would go into that system and write an exception per player that emails in about traveling. 
---
With all that said, it wouldn't hurt to try if you feel like it.
---
.... you get access to retail and classic.
---
It's not about absolute cost. It's about opportunity cost. For that same price, I can play Borderlands 3 forever instead of 9 months of wow classic.
---
What I didn't understand is that it's for regular wow as well as classic. So, most people are just getting this for free. I only want to play classic so i would need to pay more.
---
But I don't eat out very much, and I haven't been to the movies in almost a decade. I budget to pay of law school loans, save for a wedding, and put invest in retirement.
---
But the main thing I missed is that it's for both games. It makes sense now. I was totally wrong because I didn't realize that. But I'm. leaving this up anyway bc the replies are hysterical.  So many children know so much foul language. Lol
---
They actually did the math. I think it ended up being travel form was faster if you were traveling to a destination roughly 21 seconds away or closer. After that the mount speed overtakes travel form and thus is the faster option. 
---
I'm not 100% sure on the actual number, but 21 was in the general ballpark. Might be slightly less.
---
Great!
---
As a hunter all i can say is git gud my dude. 
---
Hunter is one of the strongest pvp classes in vanilla.
---
Probably.
---
I rolled a warrior with some friends with the only intention to tank and after the first RFC run I saw the pains of tanking as a warr. Haven't played a druid, but I'd think it's mostly swipe and that gets you AoE threat, so overall I think it's just easier to tank as druid.
---
You think I kill people for honor?
---
Warrior is the #1 dps king of wow
---
Yes, that is how transactions work
---
a nobody loses to a nobody
---
and nobody cares
---
It's $150/year.  I'm going to play Borderlands 3 and all DLC for life for $100. Is not about absolute cost. It's about opportunity cost.
---
While a couple I listed were pros, 90% of them were just people that played, and then because they were doing it 8-10 hours a day went on to do tournaments and such. If anyone plays a game for 8-10 hours a day, every day for years of course they’re going to be at pro level. The fact that asmon isn’t is truly astonishing. 
---
I also don’t understand why the 2 options here are 1) be a pro, and 2) ruin the fun for everyone around you. Why can’t he just be toxic to his twitch chat, and say toxic things out loud? Why does he have to create toxic environments in 100% of the places he puts himself. 
---
I’m not saying you’re wrong. I agree that drama creates more views, which creates more money. The fact that we’re even having this discussion right now proves that you’re right. We’re not sitting here talking about Bajheera, even though he’s my favorite WoW streamer. 
---
All I’m saying is that there’s a line that most streamers walk, and asmon regularly tramples all over it, which is why even though he has the biggest following I think he’s the worst WoW streamer.
---
PVE guild in vanilla. Our guild managed to get both bindings to drop, and farmed the mats to get our MT Thunderfury. Just a fews days after obtaining the sword, our MT became the guild master after the previous GM decided to take a break for personal reasons. MT disbanded the guild for reasons I still do not know, and everyone split up.
---
Like the bare bones patch 1.12 AV
---
PROTIP : there are macros to automate the turn in dialog window. Anyone going for this, save yourself some trouble and use one.
---
It’s easy
---
“I don’t like this place.”
---
“Yeah?  Well I don’t either.  Now go eat that dude’s melee attack’s while I run away.”
---
I think it is to fast as well. That said, level 20 is way below the curve right now. So your playtime is more limited than the majority.
---
What could you possibly have to gain by posting it even if it really did happen?

Yep. Your parents raised you well.

The amount of aggression in your answer is really natural and fair.

Im not a kid btw. Im 42 and i have listened many kinds of music all these years.
---
I dont really listen rap much.
---
If I listen some rap it would be portuguese. Not really mainstream lol
---
Anyway. Grow up and gtfo.
---
My thought exactly, I was like Ps....who? I've never heard of this guy.
---
The bosses just don't hit all that hard. Less damage in means less mana used for healers, that means they can last longer, which means you don't need as much dps.
---
Doesn't make his statement false tho. He probaly is a subscriber, but he is 100% correct.
---
What are you doing in classic wow? =D
---
I haven't been hostile at all. I've merely explained that I didn't know you get 2 games with it. I thought it was $13 for just the one game.
---
Wrong again
---
Boomkin is the only viable dps class
---
I think his stream is great as background noise. Since he's loud and talks constantly it's easy to follow what's going on with sound only, while I play something else on my main monitor.
---
Switched to ele/resto at 40. I'm a bit confused about gear. Should I be wearing cloth gear now or looking for leather/mail with caster stats? I go oom after 2 mobs. 
---
Also, I'm noticing killing elementals is completely out of the question. Most resist my spells. Guess I just skip those quests?
---
"it was uhhh....a night elf rogue! yes, thats it, a rogue...attacked me from behind just as i killed those beasts...for the horde!...."
---
No ...you cannot do that on Classic pvp servers.
---
Why are you even arguing with somebody who responds like he does? Guy is clearly just an angry idiot, no point in coming back with correct responses, he’ll just never change his mind.
---
Lol, lock bragging about winning a duel.
---
The reflector trinkets can be a godsend in wpvp, shadow and frost in particular. 
---
Grenades and Sapper Charges are also great for pvp and tanking. Obviously utility stuff like jumper cables as well. Doesn't hurt to keep seaforium charges too if you run into locked chests or run without a Rogue buddy.
---
Show me on the doll where the rogue touched you.
---
Back in vanilla my guild switched 1 of 3 raid nights to one I couldn't make after I'd already been in the guild a few months. They then would dock me more DKP per raid night I missed than I would make in a raid, so I basically never had enough dkp for any gear. I could raid any night of the week, but the one they chose to switch it to. My choice was basically to abandon my guild or to never get gear. (there was no understanding of my situation and no other raid night choices given for the switch) 
---
I got more of my gear through other guilds (I would sometimes play on other people's characters when they couldn't make raids) than from my own. (would get thrown some boe epics or taken to a raid if it was one of the ones I missed on our raid nights and the other guilds had on farm) I was too stubborn to just leave despite getting multiple invites from guilds better than my own. 
---
Was really frustrating to have the healer lead in all the best gear dropped heal like crap with mad over healing and no dispels disparage my gear and talent choice despite me outperforming her in my crappy gear.
---
The real winner is the NE Druid in the second clip.
---
DEFINITELY worth.
---
Besides Head of Ony (which drops every week) and Blastshot Launcher, we've only had 1 piece of DPS warrior gear drop so far and those were the wristguards of stability.
---
Been there. If I pug into a group of guildies with folks who will compete with me for loot, I either leave, or just assume I am about the get fucked and just hope for a quick,smooth, run and try to never play with those people again.
---
What are you even trying to get with this? The epitome of jack of all master of none
---
What gear would you take? Feral agi/str/int? Or resto/boom int/spr 
---
Because you always have the capability of doing multiple roles as a druid but each gear set makes your other weaker
---
Feral has no int for mana pool
---
Resto has little agi for cat damage
---
Boomkin is low tier viability and stacks spell damage vs int
---
IMO I disagree with that "100% uptime with fewer points" strategy. That isn't how crits and uptime work, you're looking at 10 attacks with a 20% crit chance in a frenzy window. That's still a 10% chance to fail with 5/5 frenzy. With a 60% chance to proc (3/5 frenzy) you're looking at a 12% chance per hit of getting a crit and proc. That means out of the 10 attacks in a frenzy proc, you've got a 28% chance to not chain; and you're getting into a frenzy chain an average of 40% later.
---
But more so, I'm also generally not sure where you're putting that extra point or two you're saving. In most specs, if you're going that deep into BM you might as well finish it out with bestial wrath; and in a more hybrid MM build, you'll get access to what, an extra point or two in barrage?
---
Wow you mean you ran into toxic people on a PVP server? I’ve got a solution for you...
---
you did it, you cracked the code.
---
u got it dude
---
This isn't a problem unique to classic. It's been a problem for 15 years. Vanilla was fine but not perfect.
---
Blizzards solution over ylthe years has been cross realm everything in retail. Maybe they'll do something that's not that in classic.
---
Mind sharing this spec that does well in PvP AND raiding?
---
Yeah it was dude. I have tons of friends who play wow and we’ve all had to deal with it at one time or another. These just the facts.
---
Yep, same goes for rogues because of how energy works.
---
Lmao sometimes fans are so pathetic. Imagine caring about a streamer so much that you have to come and defend his honor on reddit.
---
Well if you look at it for some time it seems to be  distorted in multiple places. 
---
First of the location of Teldrassil, it should be a bit further (south) west. Secondly look at where Quel’thalas is, instead of stretching north it goes straight east. 
---
It may be that it’s caused by the shape of the roof, or an early draft of the map that they forgot to change. 
---
Who knows..
---
An additional half a second is huge when reacting to something. Do not down play that.
---
LOL yea I sometimes see people Write Like This so I didn't pay attention to that at all
---
Wowhead Classic has the resets on their main page: https://classic.wowhead.com/
---
It's not super clear there that's it's on a 5-day rotation, but you can see that it's not in sync with MC. These were the values in 1.12 (set in 1.9). Which means we'll get ZG and AQ20 at 3-day lockouts!
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0
---
There’s not a lot of cheese strats in WOW, especially compared to other games. Coming from OSRS, you can safe spot nearly every mob or find some dumb way to get almost any boss down
---
Sounds exactly like Mc.
---
Yeah we actually did this but I was hoping there was a simpler solution
---
It's fine if they don't understand. They can just *walk* it off.
---
Not needed.
---
yeah, especially since they get all that hit rating built in to their talents
---
So you have a decade of saved movie money to use on the WoW sub. Glad we could solve your issue!
---
Forsure, hopefully they have some idea to help out
---
A good mage won’t lose to a warrior
---
From what I've noticed, as long as my PW:S is up, I never get that kick back. Is it possible the damage broke through the end of your shield?
---
Personally, I don’t find the prospect of having a character fund my warrior too appealing.  You’ve got to level that character to sustainable farmable levels so you’re not wasting gold gearing up and learning spells.
---
So far, I’ve found grinding lower level spots for my Alchemy recipes a breeze and potentially lucrative.  (Not enough data to confirm).  So gold making on a warrior isn’t as bad as I thought it could be.  Just nowhere near the power of a Mage and DM runs will require a healer.
---
I haven’t got to any levels of having to be Prot spec in the world, but I can imagine that being tough.
---
Regarding the laptop for tanking, if you can tab target well, then you should be okay for most dungeons.  If you’re like me and you click targets to tank, sunderinf may prove difficult.
---
As far as life at 60, I can’t attest to for another 15 levels, but I’m stoked to get there!  Hope this helps somewhat!
---
Ah yes you see I have seen this.  But this exactly what I was saying.  this is pserver info (posted Oct 2018) and has been proven incorrect during the beta.  I am wonder if anyone has updated correct info on this subject.
---
I love comments like these that have zero substance and dont add anything. My dude is probably level 22 and just likes to troll reddit
---
Yes I can.
---
yeah getting a good pattern drop for enchanting would be a strong play. good points here
---
Paulo from FUNKY TOWN?!?
---
No Sweeping Strikes though, and fury isn't really great for tanking dungeons
---
Shame that doesn't work in reverse. I regularly claim I'm the worst pvp'r in the game and I actually am.
---
I mean that you can avoid the groups if you don't like it, but you don't have any right to dictate what people should or shouldn't do. If they are finding members then there is no issue with these runs and you can just as easily do a guild run to avoid any reservations.
---
Sadly this alt is a warrior, fighting stuff higher level then me is a very bad idea unless I want to get blasted
---
You've literally played that game for 1/3 of your life. Wow is meant for people without a career and a lot of time on their hands. That's not me. I thought I could just buy wow classic for cheap. I didn't know you got both games. It's for people who are already dedicating their lives to wow, not for people who casually play a couple hours per week to gaming.
---
Oh you listen to portugués rap lmfao no that is not good rap. 
---
You need to grow up wtf you doing being 42 listening to portugués rap playing wow lmfao
---
I am not a man child, sometimes the worst content can be the funniest *shrug*
---
Growls in Big Daddy Bear Tank
---
Take care! Thanks for a pointless post
---
Cringe
---
I guess on raids, or at least hard bosses? But to be honest, it shouldn’t be a requirement at all at the moment. None of the content is “hard” enough to warrant expensive, minor boosts to DPS.
---
Typically, on progress bosses you’d get a feeling for the fight until you’re confident you can nearly get it down, and then, as a group, you use all the buffs, boosts and potions you can to give that final nudge.
---
ohh sorry ye didnt realise that - damn blindweed...
---
My reputation precedes me.
---
Yea but you have to play paladin
---
I basically stopped questing at level 38 with only about 10g. I did shellfish for a few hours and then just skinned level 38-40ish beasts for leather. Ended up with about 105 gold.
---
And my guildies said I'd never make it being an enchanter!
---
had the same question
---
Cries about 13$ a month however will run out of content in 100 hours of game play and be out 100$ on a game you won’t pick back up. Where as wow can be picked up at any time. Lawl.
---
Your statement is right but that doesnt actually matter here.. fiery is ppm, fast OH are for applying second poisons, and attacking in-between reset swing timers from what ever attack ability the rogue is using (SS, HEMO, Backstab)
---
good lucking killing princess as a green geared priest
---
80 gold mount, 20g training if ur not honored, and 90 total if ur honored
---
Not playing frost mage lol
---
Good question. Would be nice.
---
Hit isn't really a problem when leveling. Avoid mobs that are 2+ levels higher, maybe, but it's not a significant penalty when you're just questing and stuff. The hit really only matters when you're trying to reach peak dps for raids.
---
You're essentially complaining that you couldn't vendor a blue item that someone could wear when they ding 60.
---
You're not even complaining that they stole rogue gear, they're needing on gear they can actually use down the line when they swap specs.
---
Yeah, just fuckn relax dude.
---
Honestly there is no such thing as a spec you can do that is optimal for PvP and PvE. You're going to have to make some sacrifices in 1 department or another if you want to entirely avoid respec costs. 
---
The closest thing I think you could get is Paladin. You could spec down to blessing of sanctuary and be the sanctuary bitch for raids while also getting the good pvp prot tallents. Holy shock is mostly a shit ability anyway honestly and you get to pick up pretty much all of the relevant PvE tallents. 
---
Side note paladins are regarded by many to be the best PvP healers in the game as well. 
---
There is alot of these points you could shift around for personal preference as well as long as you retain the core good ones.

Back in 2007 I farmed and sold gold online. Trading 1-2k to a random low level char and would recieve payment over paypal a few minutes later. Though it was a different low level char everytime. Never the same.  I know this was 2007, but I didnt get caught and I promise you 5g is nothing. Keep playing though. I know what you're thinking. "What a shit head ruining the economy."  I was 17 and I needed weed money and I loved playing wow. Plus your friends think you are a badass when you use your paypal business card at the ATM and leave 7/11 with all the treats to keep the grind going.
---
Except I don't watch him regularly, and I didn't engage in his chat. So not really sure how that qualifies as entertainment for his fans. Unless they watch him ironically and get their entertainment from these threads...
---
Isn't Pshero the guy who uses an add-on to create fake /rolls ?
---
Wait, I'm confused.
---
Are you changing your home inn while your hearthstone is casting?
---
&gt; When low on health, try to be mindful of your line of sight to the healer. If you can't see the healer, they can't see you - can't heal you.
---
&lt;3
---
True, but it also makes me feel like tanking isn't worth my time. I'm currently rolling Hunter and having my owl offtank (it's been working amazing surprisingly) and I'm having a blast.
---
Yep.
---
I cant understand how someone want to be part of something that its called number 2, 3 and so on.
---
The lack of self respect is incredible.
---
Chances are you're better than you think you are
---
Actors arn't a thing right? Not that your country is built around idolizing celebrities who act completely different in private.
---
Our raid hasn't seen Deathbringer, Quickstrike ring, Onslaught Girdle,  OEB, Spinal Reaper, or BRE. It's been tough. We've only done MC 4 times but I would've still expected more than what we've seen by now.
---
Not sure really, I’m struggling myself somewhat. I’m just vendoring most things that aren’t worth auctioning, and try to sell as much as you can on AH. My main income is from mob drops.
---
Lol nope
---
That depends, is my original comment not true?
---
I found a player corpse yesterday... surrounded by like 8 murloc corpses. It had to be horde, because I couldn't rez him. At least he went down fighting.
---
Better than night elves! As i left dun mor i saw like 10 nightelves going there...
---
I’m pretty sure it’s regular Vanilla. Overpower pops for me also like that and crits are bigger than regular hits
---
How well do you think private servers would fare if they charged $15 a month? There are still people who refuse to play classic and stick to private servers because they don't want to pay. The day there is nothing "on the horizon" for classic, is the day classic starts to die, unless they make it free to play (spoiler alert... they won't).
---
&gt; Thanks friend. It’s probably just malice at this point. I don’t think anyone is that thick without it being on purpose.
---
Malice implies that people are intending to do evil.  Bully means to seek harm to someone.  Those two things are not exclusive.  You just keep doubling down on being an idiot.
---
I use ElvUI and that gives you lots of options for how to display your party/raid frames. The defaults are pretty good but you can also set it to show the health deficit which is super useful for determining what type of heal someone needs. I couple this with Clique and have Shift-LMB as Heal (max rank and don't have Greater Heal yet), Shift-RMB as Renew, and Ctrl-LMB as Flash Heal since it's rare that I need to cast it. I probably should put PW:S as Ctrl-RMB but that's fairly rare as well.
---
Let me know if you have additional questions.
---
I had another bad experience in BC. I was raiding and one of the raid leaders messages me and says, "Hey that hunter in our raid is actually a pretty hot girl." I said, yeah she's also 15. I was playing a Warlock at the time this is relevant because...
---
"So she has a friend who is also a female and we want them to be in the raid and she wont come w/o her friend who is a Lock as well, so your out. Sorry, man."
---
They had no gear at all and needed carried to gear up. They were both 15 and most of the raid were over 21 adults. 
---
Dumped by a raid guild cause I didn't have boobs and teehee in Ventrillo.
---
This guy also is missing the biggest part... Fiery is (to my knowledge) PPM, meaning it goes off the same amount (roughly) with a fast weapon or slow
---
Which means the problem is weeding itself out. The only runs I ever see anything reserved for are strat live and that's because tanks have 0 incentive to ever go there except to help out guild members. The 1 or 2 orb reserve runs started happening as otherwise strat would be dead content outside of guild runs.
---
Classic is harder than retail
---
Isn't gen Z like age 16-26?
---
huh?
---
I was gonna say, "if you don't wanna fuck him he probably doesn't care cause hes got a hot pinup GF." lmao.
---
I'm reacting to your initial post, when you clearly were upset.
---
I don't agree that more players automatically means less supply.  With less players, you had less people farming them and a good amount of time where a node would just sit there for an hour or 2 rather than being picked.  More players means they will be farmed much more frequently which should offset some of it at least.
---
Troll for shadow priest
---
That video thumbnail just gave me cancer.
---
Honestly you probably won't be topping charts but you bring a lot of utility and you are one of the least played classes so you will have an easier time getting into raids and will way less competition for loot.
---
where did you quest/grind for this? i just hit 32, and i'm thinking SM runs, or arathi highlands?? i think thats the next area i'll go. so i can mine quest and skin.
---
I don't think there's an option in the base game to block, but I use an add-on called Leatrix Plus that has a bunch of social settings, and blocking friend requests is one of them. That blocks all requests though.
---
Dude, blizzard has never stated that. The only times they have stated caps in reference to vanilla were because of layering. Like they intentionally have not stated what you are saying they have said. 
---
I'm not trying to argue, I'm trying to explain to you that you have misunderstood that when blizzard has said the "caps" are higher, they are stating the caps of layering. Layering is multiple replications of the world, and we do not know exactly how many players can exist in 1 layer. We do not have the information.
---
Think about it this way.
---
Server cap for layering is x amount of players per layer, multiplied by y number of layers. 
---
We do not know the actual value of x, so we can not deduce population caps when layering no longer exists.
---
Yeah but your levels don't completely drop after 1 month. This guy hasn't been outside all year and is weirdly flexing it
---
Our guild too got it this week. A warrior took it after a long lootcouncil debate. (An old gmate)
---
Then maybe, just maybe, WoW is not for you. Maybe you should focus on what you need to do rather than what you want. Everyone has something goin on, the world don’t revolve around you. It’s not their decision to make you buy a sub and play the game. Also $156-$180/year is nothing when you have a job, even on minimum wage(cuz let’s face it, if you’re on mw you’re most likely living in your moms basement)
---
On to my next point, the average AAA game is $60 and up to $120 with dlc with a campaign lasting 10-50 hours. So the cost per hour for the average AAA game is about $1.2-$6. Now with dlc it’s $1.5-$6(20-80hours). With WoW and my full time job I have played 15 days last month. 360 hours I have played or 5cents(rounded up 4.6 to be exact). You’d have to play 1200 hours of your AAA game to get to the same cost/hour.
---
What time trying to say is, it’s not about the money. Do what you want but keep your needs first. Take things in moderation. If ya want to play WoW, mix it in your schedule somewhere. No need to get on reddit and badly start a flame war.
---
&gt;games always sound goofy when I play them in french
---
Because they ARE goofy but when you play them in english they feel exotic :P
---
Tell your friend to learn how to tank
---
Now that you say it I noticed it too. Very few troll warriors around here. 
---
I can assure you that he was very brave. His might was not enough but his spirit was strong.
---
There's a swipe and we get a demo shout, and a stun on a 60s cooldown.
---
Warrs have cleave, shouts, thunderclap, sunder armor, shield bash, etc etc.
---
Was a tank in vanilla, I think it just boils down to a lot of people who don't understand threat management in classic rolling as warriors.
---
Funny, my group's also done MC 4 times and hasn't seen any of those either except for OEB.  We also haven't seen Vis'kang or BB, which has to be frustrating for our rogues and warriors since all of the DPS warriors are fury and all the rogues except one are combat.
---
He probably buys it by the 6 months
---
More like a bad version of Howard Stern?
---
I get it, but OP only received the messages because he accepted the friend request.  You just shouldn't be able to see opposing factions bnet at all, but that's not what we have atm.
---
SSD
---
Deviate Fish, wreckages, and the fish that I cook up for that 3 mana every 5 seconds buff mostly! A stack of Savory Deviate Delights sells for 1-1.5 gold on my server and my SO found us some recipes!
---
Talent trees
---
Pretty sure you could heal any 5 man without any talents. The guy that kicked him is just a toolbox
---
You shit on Blizzard without even understanding or doing any research. 
---
Of course you get called out and downvoted. Dumb post.
---
It can be hard to find leather or especially mail with a lot of caster stats, so if cloth is what you have use that.  Also, just because you are ele/resto doesn't mean you are unable to hit things with your weapon.  Elementals that are immune to either nature or fire are a pain, but not impossible.  Going oom is kind of how it goes if you are relying on spells to kill mobs. If you want to fight longer without drinking, stack more int, get some +nature damage gear if you can, and try to pull mobs back to where you drop totems, such as mana spring/searing totems.
---
All this and more! for just acting like a loser for teens!
---
That doesn't make any sense, why would they force you to buy T1 over T2? And why couldn't you say no? That's some weird shit dude.
---
I make a good chunk of money just by sending anything that looks like someone might pay money for it to my bank alt and then spending a few minutes each day going through the AH and seeing what I can sell at a profit compared to the vendor price.
---
The print screen button is useless with multiple screens, use the snipping tool instead.
---
But the HunterTimers are not really very useful then? I can see myself when the auto went out
---
the only one that can require you to do something is you. Now you might want to do something else, with other people. Who have standards and requirements for them to do something. From there you make a choice if it is worth it to you or not.
---
If you want to set the requirements, run your own groups. It's a very easy system.
---
what would you sell one for?
---
I shoulda levelled a shaman, daym. (15min hearth)
---
For the horde!
---
I love that when you are trying to drawn or write a little kid but you can’t distinguish them because they are a krabby patty squid hybrid, or a voidwlaker. You just slap a propeller hat on them.
---
How does it have anything to do with that when the lag issue has existed long before they reduced layers as well as on retail where layering doesn't even exist?
---
Sure, you may notice it more often since there's more players per layers, but layering isn't the *cause*.
---
get roasted
---
Is this satire
---
Yeah seriously, I don't understand dropping 60-80$(CAD) on AAA games that only have 30-80 hours of content. 
---
If I play an hour to two hours a day on average thats like 2 months maximum and all the content is complete... 
---
At that rate instead of paying a sub you're paying a flat amount of 60+ dollars every 2 months.
---
Did you buy abilities every time you could?
---
Its just for the lols! Or is it....? I recently got brutality blade. I prefer dagger in pvp aswell, though it can be rather annoying to play in pve outside of raids. You overaggro so easily and then you cant use backstab..
---
But i would prefer to play dagger in raids and in pvp!
---
You do realize that most other classes just die in that situation...right?
---
Strength and Honor
---
Agreed. I think it’ll start getting tougher around 55 or so. Planning to respec to Disc then and grind out a ton of BRD
---
But how is there less competition? Arent warlock using cloth gear like mages ?
---
BRD takes 2 hours for the whole run. What the hell are you doing in deadmines to take so long?
---
How tf you get to 40 without being honored with your race city
---
How do you guys track Threat generation?  My understanding is there isn't a good mod for it so I'm pretty much feeling my way through for now.
---
I personally don't recommend AOE farming until lvl 40 with Frost Barrier and Mount.
---
So you don't watch him but you're complaining about his delivery and how he's an ass. I feel you're hiding something... 
---
And yes, it's entertaining to read people hating him on these threads. You buy into what he sells perfectly.
---
Thanks for the reply! Love the name. Watching the boys right now lol
---
Is it an undead mage? They call it ghost toast!
---
If you can't play enough to warrant a measly $13/mo It's honestly probably not the game for you anyways. It's way too much of a grind to be playing once in a blue moon. With as little time as you are claiming to have I wouldn't even play classic if it was free.
---
If you can't spare 15 fucking dollars a month, then you shouldn't be playing games anyway. Save your money and grow up.
---
Way back in HS I played the Wrath expansion for a single summer. 3 months. Because that's all I could afford being a broke Junior in HS. But I didn't complain about the cost. 
---
If you don't have the time to play, don't. But don't complain that it's a money issue because it's obviously just a mentality that you're set in that "blah blah blah" should be cheaper because you don't have the time to put into it as others. Go away with this BS.
---
&gt;Just the right amount of *dickishery*. 
---
Since when is being a dick to someone for no reason justifiable?
---
&gt;Do your research before you post.
---
In hindsight, sure, I probably should have. But that's not a reason for the entire sub to be dicks. There's a lot of anger and frustration built up on this sub. I'm glad it's being taken out on me, honestly, because I find it funny.
---
&gt;Classic has had so many articles on how and when to play that there is really no excuse for being as uniformed as you are, and then making a post and replies as salty as all of yours.
---
Probably not a great excuse, but I do have a reason. I'm watching the chess.com fisher random tournament, and an ad came up. I went to the website, and it asked me to pay a subscription. I just wanted to check out the game, but not for $15/mo. That's all. I wad mildly annoyed, and then it went away.
---
Lol, And then I got brigaded.
---
&gt;Bad post, take your medicine.
---
Definitely a bad post. But I'm not on any medication that would affect this. Mental illness isn't a joke. You especially shouldn't insult someone about that in case they do have issues. See how sensitive everyone on here is about a random.stranger's opinion? They all took great offense to something impersonal to them. Now imagine it was personal, about something as sensitive as a psychological issuem
---
&gt;Reddit loves correcting people and then ridiculing them for their errors.
---
This sub is cancerous. These folks have serious anger issues and WWWAAAYYYY to much time on their hands.
---
Revenge gives more threat than sunder, so shield block-&gt;revenge is still better than sunder if revenge is off cooldown and you haven't gotten the dodge/block yet.

Bye Felicia

sp is fun as hell. 52 sp here
---
Ohh...that's a good point about the warlocks. Very good to remember. Thanks!
---
The idea is that one of his bags is a soul bag and therefore cannot store normal loot at all. Effectively losing am entire bag slot of inv space.
---
If it wasn't generalizing you xenophobe.
---
Yeah I just feel bad for all these kids that join Olympus and expect all guilds to be like that, dysfunctional and completely centered around the guild master.
---
I am lucky to have joined a pretty large and great guild who members help each other out all the time, and with a guild chat that is pretty active.
---
Lmfao that's fair!
---
At a certain point, +heal allows you to downrank spells which will still give the same amount of healing of higher costing spells but at lower mana thus reducing the need of a larger INT pool.  There’s argument for higher int = higher crit with spells but leaving a heal up to chance isn’t the best option
---
The UI is so cool
---
And yet people eat this shit up here for some reason.
---
Yeah but then i remember the trolls, the racists, the whiny 12 year olds... think about how much time i spent running a raiding guild for the majority of that time... and acknowledge that i am far less tolerant of bullshit now. Lol.
---
It's not that it's hard, it's that they might not buy the skills to save money
---
A curse on all the pig houses!!!
---
Glad you like it, make sure you read my main comment for the proper links.
---
I am not sure what you issue is with just reporting the guy... let the GM's handle it... I didn't say make a ticket and demand they perma ban this asshole... clearly the dude is in the wrong on a couple of fronts... whether any of it will be actionable is up to blizzard.
---
The cost of a WoW subscription hasn't changed in 15 years. 
---
Fun fact, due to inflation, $15 back in 2004 is equivalent to $20.37 today.
---
Where my wild growth shoulders at yo? I'm literally the only druid in the raid, just drop already :p
---
Can you post your macro please?
---
I'm not concerned about being frugal. I said fitting it into my budget. There's a difference. BL3 fit into my budget. For $5/mo I would try out wow classic. For $15, I won't.
---
I believe you want to charge &gt; defensive stance &gt; battle shout &gt; start sundering. That way you immediately put threat on all the mobs. If for some reason one turns, just taunt it back. I almost never run into problems with this strategy. If I start missing sunders I'll throw another shout in.
---
one of my richest friends makes most of his gold fishing. he is in azshara most the day so make of that what you will. he regularly sends me pictures of 3-4 pages of auctions
---
I think it was like maraudon or something. He heals at max level as shadow in all our 5 man's. Not a problem at all.
---
I made the vast majority of my lvl 40 mount gold between level 36 and 40. I figured the same thing, I just kept leveling up until I noticed my gold piling up way faster than ever. At that point I was able to do a few hours of mob grinding and I was good to go. Besides only training the most important skills, I didn't waste any time or effort in the early levels trying to save up gold.
---
Forgive me its not my pic
---
I still don't understand how a community formed around him. He's neither witty, attractive, nor particularly skilled. I thought you needed at least one of the those three qualities to be a successful internet personality/streamer. But he has none of them.
---
Is there a discount at revered? I specifically recall levelling  a troll and giving up at the discount since i was not going to reach it without cloth turn ins. So i just bought the mount at higher price.
---
Tanks shouldn’t be expected to hold aggro off other melee dps if they’re not attacking the same target. If your friend is using a shield tell him to stop and use a 2h. He needs to start every pull with bloodrage then charge, WW then get sweeping strikes up. Then maybe switch to a 1h and shield if he’s taking a lot of dmg. I’ve ran Mara several times and there are like two pulls that I think you need to have a shield for other than that more dmg and holding aggro better would be better for the healer. He would also be better off Arms. Lastly there are going to be shit runs, it happens just forget about them and move on.
---
I don't see bonereaver's edge in that loot table!
---
I thought it was for wow classic only, not both games. My mistake.
---
It's not the same actually. Ever heard of inflation?
---
54 would be the lowest I’d take a hunter for BRD. With a bunch of 52s and 53s you’re not gonna have a good time. Hit 54 minimum
---
Bear tanks are amazing when feral specced. I never lose agro on a mob I'm directly attacking, and only struggle when there's a ton of AOE around me (which any tank would struggle with). Also note that your DPS does need to let you tank for a few moments to build up threat before unloading.
---
I'm currently level 34 on my druid and I've successfully tanked every instance between WC and SM Library ... with the exception of Gnomeragon cause fuck that.
---
Are druids viable? Absolutely! Are they the best at anything? No. But they are decent to good at everything.
---
Lolol I had a war in ZF that "misclicked" on the first pull. I was like, "please don't use blood fury." He responds with "sorry was a misclick. won't happen again"... He used bloodfury over 20 times that run and would die sometimes from it (i made sure it never wiped the group) and would always post "..." in chat after he died like he didn't know what went wrong and it wasn't his fault. Drove me crazy. A few simple mistakes make a run colorful. Consistent mistakes are blegh
---
That is to say, thank you very much for removing it from your bar and making sure not to keep using it &lt;3
---
You can go for the mara ring and the hinterlands elite quest trinket at 50 for sure.
---
Everything else, probably 57-58 min for LBRS, devilsaur are probably around that same level but you might as well just buy off AH, BRD is doable around 52-53 with more like 56 for emperor.
---
weak sauce. Side button on mouse for hunter mark, scroll wheel forward pet attack and \` to start auto attack. You def need an auto attack bound cause the initial cast you can use scorpid sting or arcane between auto attacks.
---
It’s finicky but it def does offer rested exp
---
Even worse for me, I wound up creating a sub account so I can play my druid and either shaman/hunter/bank_alt at the same time.
---
And I'm tempted to do it again so I can try a priest+pally.
---
This. Impale is useless until you get your crit to high number at endgame.
---
Melee loot with no BRE even. Sad!
---
Well soon you will learn they are directly correlated and each value is calculated using other two. Why the fuck does it matter?
---
I just had an Undead Priest escort me all the way across plaguelands - they’re not all bad!
---
Can’t craft it till phase 2 right? So you have time!
---
I've gotten to the point where I keep a full soul bag of shards and replenish when I use them rather than the other way around. 
---
My drain soul macro auto deletes the last item in my soul bag so when it's full and one is made, one gets deleted. If it's not full nothing is deleted and the shard is added to the bag.
---
My understanding (from videos, so don't hold me to it) is that the encounter with princess does have a bit of RNG as it relates to her rotation and that sometimes you get a bad draw. I should hit 60 tonight and will try some princess runs. If I remember, I will post results here :D
---
So it's better for Feral over Resto... because it helps you heal and decurse. Got it.
---
I've been thinking about this a lot recently. I'm someone in my mid-20s now and starting to feel less and less connected to newer generations. I just don't get "zoomers". I worry that I'm going to have the same mind set that every older generation has ever had about younger people and that makes me a little sad. I've always told myself that I would never want to think this way. But I mean, come on. Some of these kids are fucking crazy lol. But I guess we were like that too so maybe all young people are just little bastards.
---
Which else class would you give it to?
---
It’s good enough to hold aggro over initial heals but not for DPS to go nuts.
---
See look that’s where your deficiency isn’t doing you any favors here sweetheart.  Insults =/= anger :) this way of thinking is probably what leads you to a lot of issues you’re having right now.
---
Of the 9 times you’ve posted this to this sub, 0 of them are remotely funny.
---
30sp on a skinning knife will last you till 60 really
---
I have no idea why this dude is trying to defend the servers not handling the fights? It's baffling to me.
---
Okay.
---
Two points: first, this group was screwing you and you're right to be annoyed with them. But second, Feral druids need a tanking and damage set to be effective endgame, and both should be considered MS. OS would be their healing set.
---
Idk, I don't think I agree on that. English doesn't sound exotic to me, but french always sounds goofy in fantasy settings, unless it's been originally written in french. Spanish also sounds super goofy to me(in fantasy settings), and it's not my first language, so I think it really has to do with translations.
---
Law school loans are a bitch. Plus I'm planning a wedding, so I'm not getting that much free time to play games.
---
Why do you need to go to personal insults? I never insulted you? why are you so mean?
---
A) DPS are *very* responsible for aggro fuckery. No matter how good a tank is in Classic, the DPS have to work with him or a run will be a disaster. This is on your DPS. Threat off a high DPS character isn't always manageable. What you do at that point is tank everything but the primary target while the blender warrior tanks the one mob. This stresses the healer a bit, but when a really powerful DPS hits the field it's the only option.
---
B)
---
1)If a pull goes bad because of stupid DPS, implement this rule. There are plenty of situational moments when AoE is acceptable.
---
2) After a couple warnings, if it's bad enough yes. But generally try to be tolerant if it's manageable. There's a limit on tolerance of course.
---
3) Comps very rarely are critical outside specific encounters. Nothing in Mauradon I know of.
---
4) Nope, still putting this on your DPS
---
5) Mage CC can be very helpful if your tank is struggling in any case. Rogues can also sap. Use the tools you have available if the situation warrants it.
---
6) Wait. Let the tank get hits on everything. Then the DPS need to be focused on the correct targets. AoE only for low health trash mobs that can be kited properly or killed promptly.
---
TLDR: Yeah, DPS need a brain too. Their job is the simplest, but it tends to go against their base instinct of "DPS meter high, I good".
---
Yeah I'm not saying to do it I'm just trying to explain why people buy/sell accounts. I personally do not partake.
---
/rprequelmemes
---
No, you can be summoned, it's your evil twin that cannot be summoned
---
There's no way. You can easily farm 50g per hour.
---
You'll want an initial burst of threat for Battle Shout to be effective. TClap is alright but Engi Dynamite is best.
---
Yes it is. In the grown up world, people make money so they can take the massive financial risk of buying a $13 game.
---
Forgot the plans on the table behind him tho
---
Step 1) Open "Change your Home" dialog box
---
Step 2) Cast Hearthstone
---
Step 3) Right before cast finishes, hit Yes
---
As a warlock and priest player I like this list
---
I'm glad you have unilaterally decided how the game is meant to be played.
---
No, +heal is just garbage wear until 60.
---
People talk about downranking like they know what’s going on, and then start running on about it before then just don’t have a clue. 
---
The early game gear is a noob trap to make flippers profit- don’t buy a single piece.
---
Thanks! It means I haven't lost my writerly touch (yet). :) Seriously though, it was the kind of moment in time that just sticks with ya. I'll never forget it.
---
Asmongold belongs in /r/hittablefaces
---
I will never, *ever* forgive Chromaggus for keeping me stuck at 7/8 for **five months** because he refused to drop my shoulders.  If he doesn't drop Netherwind the first time we kill him on Classic servers I'm going to bitch about it, even though I don't be 7/8 and don't even really want them that much.  But fuck that dragon-dog anyway.
---
Hey ik chap ook wel es ass
---
I must know what nameplate addon he is using!!
---
You need minor movement speed on your boots or else its really really hard. Use voidwalker and send him in in order to make her fart and stop movement. Vw will occassionally absorb bolders she throws as well. Good luck
---
D3 with k2 even better.
---
As a hunter you should run Mara princess runs until you get the Blackrock ring or whatever that is...it’s BiS for all physical dps classes. 50 is perfect for princess runs. Other than that just push to 54 and try to do some BRD arena runs.
---
Should what?
---
Healers (and tanks) get blamed all the time by DPS when things go wrong. It happens. 
---
When I'm in a bad group that starts blaming me for their mistakes I leave. It takes less time for a healer to find a new group than it does for dps to find a healer. I don't need that kind of stress in a game I'm playing in order to relax.
---
Leave group, put them on ignore and move on.
---
I only have 112g at 39 :(
---
Were you able to understand the image? Yes? Oh really?
---
Then stfu about print screen already....
---
Phase 3 and bwl
---
This has been one of my main complaints, when phase 2 rolls around the scale will be even larger. Blizz needs to fix their server issues ASAP
---
Stop vendoring stuff, sell everything you can on the ah, even if it takes a week.
---
They'll drop the first week you have to miss a raid.  That's the rule.
---
I’m not super familiar with druid healing, but from what I do know Druid healers don’t care about crit since they don’t have any talents that have any secondary effects on a crit and two of their three heals have a HoT effect which can’t crit.
---
Even then it will be rough because every opposite faction player can actually get something from killing you.
---
Because the best comp was always spellcleave right? And ret paladin OP? Lol you obviously have no idea what you're talking about. Ret was completely dead in season 7 and 8. That's why prot ret was even a thing in s8 and even then hardly anyone played it.
---
 I feel like having both bindings will just be burning a hole in your pocket for months!

so you're a child, got it.
---
That's not where the misunderstanding is. I didn't realize that you get both games for 15/mo. I thought it was for only classic. 15/mo for classic alone isn't worth it if regular wow is also 15/mo.  But both for 15 makes more sense.
---
Nope.  My friend, if you drop a skill, you unlearn it as it warns you.  Unlearning entirely and having to re-learn it if you should pick it up again.
---
People who sincerely care about having to look at a phone image instead of a screenshit is pathetic.
---
Grow up.
---
you kidding me? cloth is a constant influx and no one could give 2 sh*ts about this method of moneymaking for more than a few days. 
---
In runescape you can go buy vendor items and put them on the grand exchange and make upwards of 1 million gold an hour. Not many people do it because it is a bit tedious and people get bored of doing it. afk methods for chump change are the same way... no one is going to keep doing this long enough to make a dent in the cloth market. People have been making bandages with cloth like mad and still making a profit, but the method still works.
---
yep shadow heal is fine, when he has those runes that gives you mana for life, well then its pretty much easy!
---
Mines name is maktast and the job he does is maktastic.
---
Only to threaten my life no doubt.
---
Advantages for Fury Warrior: Heavy armor, steady consistent high damage, the \*option\* of tanking dungeons if you'd like to. Plus stance dancing is fun.
---
Advantage for Rogues: Bursty damage at the start of the fight with potential to end the fight fast. As a general rule, Rogues will kill trash mobs very quickly. Rogues can also stealth, pick pockets, pick locks, use poisons.
---
Essentially, the latter has many more tools designed to kill or otherwise incapacitate targets. But the former is much harder to kill and can probably handle adds more easily. Rogues also have a more entertaining toolkit.
---
So here's my question. I don't really have any desire to tank in the end-game, but I'm willing to do it while gearing up for raids to make farming easier/faster. It's a lot easier to get a group going if you started off with a tank in the group. 
---
Now I'm fine with your standard fury spec tanking, I know it's easily doable because I did it in Vanilla quite a bit, just throw on plate gear and a shield and I'm golden, but I've seen a lot of people recommending a prot/fury build - How much if any easier does that make the tanking aspect of things / and how much worse does that make the DPS aspect of things?
---
I want to know what that tank is doing / wearing for those 800 dps warriors to not pull off of him. I'll pull off my tank at 500 DPS everytime.
---
this comment makes zero sense.
---
Good honest info.
---
My first run of LBRS was a quest run so once we had the cd we all got a portal to IF and then turned it in and continued on with the dungeon. I suppose it just depends on what kind of group you go with. 
---
Its good to let people know before hand and 90% of the time people dont care in my experience.
---
So these videos are just surfacing. I don't want to be a blizzard apologist, but should we give them a bit of time to start looking into this? Phase 2 is where this is going to hit the hardest so as long as they fix it before then, I will be satisfied.
---
^click ^^it^^^?^^^^?
---
How important is the suppression talent in aff for pvp and pve?
---
If Big, true
---
Warrior here. Didn’t bother with any unnecessary ability rank upgrades, only levelled skinning and vendored all the leather, mainly levelled from dungeons starting with wailing caverns and I had 92g at my level 40 ding
---
This dude just full of shards in case he needs to summon a raid
---
Level 53 here with 225 +healing which is starting to invert some spell efficiencies. No idea wtf you're talking about.
---
I had asked a question in the previous comment. Maybe you’ll get to that sometime instead of ridicule.
---
Ravager tanks are just a toilet for mana.
---
Lol you too
---
What does the recipe run on other servers? It's usually 10-25g. I've been considering picking one up once I get my mount
---
It shows the order in which to train your talents. More importantly though, you can copy and paste the url into their addon which will put a sidebar on your talent tree that you can click to quickly train while leveling.
---
My point is that in a pug you might be only against 1 hunter or 3 of them might already have the sinew.
---
A pug is not locking in a small chance. It can go either way.
---
Not sure. I've seen posts on forums and reddit that say just using an authenticator or authenticator app will be enough to prevent bans, but I haven't heard anything about VPN's. It's an automated system so who knows.
---
I dont regret it one bit. I wanted to play troll. I use devilsaur and I have 10% hit now. Top 5 dps in my raid and I'm the only troll warrior. Its like a 5% difference you'll never notice unless both people are playing 100% perfect. I do plan to get edgemasters if I can get cloudkeeper leggings tho
---
Yes you have to put your weapon names
---
All of the utility you bring to a midgame dungeon is irrelevant when you could be a mage or warrior doing more damage and making the dungeon go faster. Most of the people in lfg or world chat are trying to go as fast as possible, so they don't want to take a suboptimal dps. Just form your own groups if you have trouble getting into others. It's what I had to do when I felt like being a cat for a dungeon.
---
This has definite copypasta potential
---
Dice have a looooooooong memory!
---
No.  Wait.
---
Dice have no memory.  My bad.
---
What's the addon for the stats bar at the top of the screen?? Cool photo!! Grats on 60!
---
Well you can have several tanks trying to fight for threat and have dps go really slow before she starts flying.
---
You always will have an issue, if all of your tanks will be hit by a frieball and start with 0 threat.
---
Why do you keep bringing up retail? They have explained a hundred times how they changed the way data is processed in classic compared to retail. Spells and whatever is MUCH more demanding in retail which is why the 40v40 DK vs Pala AV match fiasco happened.
---
They wrote this in the recent post about layering being reduced: "First and foremost, players have leveled up and spread out around the world. This allowed us to accommodate more players per layer, which means fewer layers required per realm. The last time a server in this region had more than three layers was the first week of September, and almost all realms reached two layers shortly after that. This includes high population realms such as Faerlina, which has had only two layers for three weeks now."
---
Which means that they reduced the amount of layers after the first week, which is why you now see lag during large battles. The APES fight happened in late September when the lag came into question, this further proves that reducing the amount of layers this early took a toll on the servers and they need to be beefed up.
---
They have again explained that they don't want more than 1 layer per realm when phase 2 launches and they always followed that statement up with: "We are actively working towards that goal". WHICH AGAIN means that they are working on a solution to the lag that is happening when there's too few layers.
---
Unlikely you’d want this version with all the flight paths. Check out my comment where I link the original map. There is a link to a google drive file without any flight paths.

He makes himself hateable, so people hate him. Human nature. And as the sage Terry Pratchett pointed out, hate is an attractive force; it’s the destructive inverse of love. So people who hate him are drawn to him, if only to see him fail.

I'm sure the rule actually covers this scenario too TBH
---
You're all over the board. Druids can do everything, *but not all at once.* When you're building your pvp spec you have to decide if you are going for physical or magic damage. Commit points to one or the other, not both. 
---
You've got points in nature's reach and reflection which are good for a kitey caster build that forcesan prolonged engagement over a large distance, but then you drop 5 points into natural weapons. 
---
You've also got a huge investment in resto but stop 2 points short of taking one of the best druid pvp spells in the game: nature's swiftness. Also improved rage is a waste of 5 points in a pvp spec.
---
This spread of depth is not unusual for flagrunning builds, but they transfer more power into healing (and sometimes bear talents)and less into offensive power that you're not going to be using anyways. Seriously, why are you taking bonus caster range AND increased physical damage? what exactly is the game plan here?
---
&gt; Why is flying so important?
---
Because it is fun. It has nothing to do with PvP (which is terrible, and brings terrible attitudes to the game.)
---
I've never been someone to have many alts, even on retail. A single character is already a big commitment.
---
That's like killing a unicorn!
---
How exactly does threat generation work with Sweeping Strikes?  I'm tanking with an Arms leveling spec and I was just wondering if the threat generated from a Revenge's Sweeping Strike is equivalent to the original Revenge or the damage of that hit
---
I asked a question so I was rightfully put on blast? Is it a sin to ask a question?
---
yeah i'm quite aware of druids in the raid scene, but i think it's quite unfair when i got ignored at level 48 as dps druid for ZF.
---
Most people just didn't reply to my whisper, a few said they preferred mages or rogues
---
My rogue alts just hit 38. Needed to level ench on main so I have sent over boe greens from ah with high lvl enchants twice now and have been using a mh with fiery since lvl 26.  It's made huge diff to leveling speed especially the lvl 2 boots with run speed I've kept and swap out to travel.  Fighting boots go on for mob grinds with agil.   Kinda try hardy but it's been stupidly fast and fun leveling ripping through even red mobs and elites till now.
---
Yup I'm 35 lol
---
It's a Capitalist idea. As long as you can find "buyers" it should work. Worst case, you'll spend a night or two trying it, not get any takers, get some naysayers, and then decide its not worth it.

No legitimate reason they couldn't just add honor system but delay BWL another month or two.

you don't need to make up definitions for words the rules are pretty clear you can't show someones name if you're talking about them negatively

I tought I explained in the text what my goal was, but I respect your opinion.

You arent honorless after you run back and rez, though

I agree with this statement here. I’ll take the risk on someone using ML and if they ninja something, make note of the guild/person and never group with them period.

Had a rogue/Druid try and ninja the shield from Eranikus for no good reason. Immediately blacklisted them.

The first person who touches the ticket is supposed to be Tier 1 support. That doesn't necessarily mean he's the first to respond to the person who opened the ticket. However, as you've described it, four first level GMs have touched the ticket, decided they could resolve it themselves and closed it again. So all four first level responses have been bad for you.

Way to pick a fight with someone actually on your side btw. Unsubscribing from this discussion now.

I play on Pagle, which is one of if not the highest pop servers.  Had little issue with questing and grouped up where I could, though it still took about a month to hit 60 because I am also a normal human with a job and social life.  Unless attitudes are changing, it should be pretty easy to find a group or start your own; questing as a group is always more efficient than solo, even if it's for just one quest.
---
&gt;  Your comments imply that bringing one to a raid is never feasible, and that's what I'm commenting on.

No, my comments imply that you would always rather have something else given the choice, ignoring other factors such as the person behind the keyboard.

Not sure how people don't have enough gold. You should easily have enough by then. Never buy anything from the auction house and only train skills you need to level with.

What is that, one 't' per percentage of the population? Get out of here. The overwhelming majority are not 60.

That’s great that you think that’s the problem, the real problem is that blizzard is doing a lot more anti-cheat than private servers. It could also be that private servers were coded using udp instead of tcp, which world of Warcraft has always used. It has nothing to do with being ‘optimized for sharding’ and everything to do with being optimized for stable client server communication with the primary goal of eliminating cheating. It’s not something that just paying extra money is going to solve. They would need to rewrite all of their networking code to fix the problem. 
---
I really wish people who didn’t know anything about game programming wouldn’t go around making wild claims about how companies don’t give a shit or want their games to fail. Seriously are you 3 years old? You think a company is trying to make its game a failure so that they will make less money? No I think even a 3 year old would understand the flawed logic there. You must have been dropped on your head, repeatedly, from a great height.
---
Can you expand a bit on his effect on other people on the server? As someone who plays on the server, I haven't even run into him once and I don't know how I've really been affected. If anything, I've enjoyed some of the WPvP and other events the streamers put on.
---
Also, they clearly announced what server they were rolling on beforehand, and I haven't run into anyone on the server who doesn't know who the big streamers are. Everyone knows what they signed up for.
---
Fair.  But you'd be surprised how unskilled many are.
---
Also how many retail players that think they're skilled, lulz.
---
Turns out everyone sucks.
---
I'm a 48 warlock and I've been trying to get a ZF group since 45. It's not you dude. If you arent a priest, warrior or mage finding pre 60 groups is quite difficult.
---
Focus on spirit and talents that boost mana regen.  Reflection is a key talent.  Work on healing in bursts.  Drop spells in succession then wait.  Your goal is to maximize the time you spend outside of the 5 second rule (no mana regen until 5 seconds have passed since the last time you spent mana).
---
Make a spreadsheet for yourself.  Find the most efficient hp/mana spells you have.  These will be your primary healing methods.  I can't speak for your rotation but as a priest, I will almost exclusively use my maximum rank heal at 35.  Wait until it has full value and then cast it.  If the tank can withstand it, two of them back to back.  Heal has such a high efficiency for mana spent, that using other spells just eats my mana.  The rest of my toolkit is for emergency heals or when I have a surplus and might reach full mana.
---
I stack spirit like it's my job.  Currently, I have 150mp5 when not casting.  This gives me a heal spell every 10 seconds.  My mana pool doesn't matter that much and my heals are more than enough right now.
---
The primary benefit of +healing is to downrank spells or if the incoming damage is so high you need to focus on surviving.  The former only occurs when you reach around 200 spell power or so.   There are plenty of calculators out there that tell you which spell is the most effective at which spell power.  The latter really only occurs in PvP, specifically battlegrounds.  Where the different between a 700 and an 800 heal will determine a fight whereas having mana to keep healing for 5 minutes or more doesn't.  This relies heavily on dying to get back full mana.
---
So like a captain obvious thing?
---
How are they idiots? I see a raid full of winners.
---
Peace
---
Which prof would be the most profitable/helpful out of the two that I have?
---
But then why do you need coffee? 😜
---
This seems legit, and explains why I never noticed on my priest in wotlk
---
You shouldn't have to explain that GREED = sell for money. That should be standard and people should ask before assuming otherwise.
---
Tanking dungeons isn't so much about always having threat on all targets at all times. It's about having threat on what you can have threat on, and dealing with the rest appropriately.
---
Putting 1 sunder on a bunch of different targets isn't going to do enough vs sustained aoe. You're better off dumping a lot of sunders into 1-2 mobs, and knowing that the third one is going to get away, but being ready to taunt it back and then sunder it, while the threat you've worked up on the others hopefully is enough. And even if they break away, it doesn't matter, if they're almost dead. No DPS is getting one shot by any add in a 5 man. 
---
It sounds like the biggest problem is that he's fury, and probably doesn't have tactical mastery. Remember how I said you need to focus on 1-2 mobs, and then deal with the others that get away? Well you're gonna need to change stances to deal with things. Taunt, Mocking blow, disarm and intercept are your big tools here(+Conc blow if youre prot), and you've got to change stances to get to some of those. Also, without tac mastery you can't easily make use of the rage generated by charging. 
---
ALSO, it's just gonna be hard to keep up in threat, period, if you're using a 1h+shield, with no shield slam and no defiance. you're doing 10% less damage, but only have a x1.3 threat modifier from D stance! So you've got to use a 2h when possible to keep the damage high enough to compete. 
---
with tac mastery, you can open up with a charge, berserker stance, bloodrage, whirlwind, D stance opener. This should get you started on everything in the pack. And no, changing stances to mocking blow is not stupid. it's practically required. 
---
The thing about that other warrior.... if you're SS and WWing ASAP on pull, you are now the tank. Because that is *exactly* what I would do if I were arms and tanking. charge, bloodrage, sweeping strikes, zerker stance, WW. huge aggro on everything. Two warriors in the group, one ostensibly being the tank and the other doing that? In reality, they're both tanking. And that's fine. Where that warrior went wrong was not realizing that it was fine and he didn't need to be a big baby about it. Which leads me to my next point....
---
as a tank you have to realize when it's okay to just let someone else tank a mob. you have to make the decision of opportunity cost. If you blow resources trying to get a mob off a teammate, is that going to actually be a net positive, or are you going to lose threat on something else in the meantime? If you exert effort getting a mob off a warrior, just to lose another mob that starts hitting a warlock, that wasn't worth it. So sometimes the right move is to just let the other guy tank it. Generally if it's a warrior or an enhance shaman, it's gonna be hard to keep threat off their target anyway. And they're armored enough that you can let them handle it for a bit. If it's a frost mage who has Nova up, he's safe for a long time. If it's a hunter, he's gonna feign and it will come back to you. If it's a rogue, he's got evasion. but you've gotta keep in mind they dont always have this stuff, so you can't get lazy. It's just about realizing how much time you have. 
---
And honestly this is smart sometimes, especially with a mage. if a mob is running slowly toward a mage, he's doing 0 dps to the group. By letting him walk toward the mage, you are saving healer mana. And then you just run over and taunt before he gets there. Or intercept. 
---
Basically I'm saying there's no secret formula to follow every time. You have to pay attention to what your party is attacking, who they are, what their CDs and skill levels are, and make decisions on the fly about which abilities to use on which mobs to keep control of them long enough for the pack to die.
---
I'm glad I did, at least while it was still progression. We one shot most bosses and there were times when I would have died if not for the extra 1K HP.
---
Interesting choice of music OwO
---
That’s so nutty I hope to have one on my troll mage eventually
---
I’ll probably try and find a cool looking white to do it on...
---
If you honestly think you will get geared faster Pugging than running with a regular guild then you are just dumb. You might luck out one week but over time tier after tier...
---
Awesome, come to Herod and I'll give you a cookie?
---
sableon initially said that the lags could be caused by the DB, so I answered that it has nothing to do with the DB as the server doesn't sync every character with the DB every 10s and having people  stacked or not would have no effect on DB sync performance.
---
DaGermanGuy then said that network datas sent to others scales as n² which is true but is irrelevant as I didn't claim the opposite so I answered that network datas and DB sync are 2 totally different things.
---
Nah, you’re just an attention deprived man child. I’ve given you enough as it is, cya
---
from what I can recall, Millennials cutoff is the mid-90's for birth years. What I have always thought of when I hear "zoomers' is the younger side of Generation Z as I thought it was attributed to kids who can't sit still due to the overstimulation of technology from a young age lol
---
Shit dude it was a joke
---
I think "pexing" is french slang for questing or leveling ? never heard of it before but based on some googling that's my best guess
---
But +heal items usually don't have int/as much int, doesn't it mean I just trade one thing for equal thing? Why is +heal better?
---
FUCK i did this three days ago but i was 25 xp away it gives you 8xp LOL. good job man
---
Sound like your own fault for rolling on a PVP server.
---
Exactly :)
---
I always find it fascinating how some people can miss the humor in extremely obvious situations.
---
First you must teach her the importance of mouse turning over keyboard turning.
---
I'd rather have some strength to be honest. Actually, with a bit of luck I'll be rolling windfury.
---
IMO it’s so hard to pass up undeads priest racial if you are playing horde
---
I find he can disconnect you from reality pretty well, so if you're prone to using Wow for ducking from reality, it's a draw
---
I can feel the "C'mon... c'mon... (Caster begins preparing a spell) -C'MON C'MON  C'MON! YES! I CAN DIE WITHOUT SHAME!"
---
1. Spec prot if you mainly dungeon
---
2. Stack as much thorns gear as you can (gnomer helm gives thorns buff without needing to wear it)
---
3. Get a shield spike
---
4. Actively tell your dps to give you a second, if they don’t and it’s more than you can handle, don’t group with them until they learn.
---
This is still a game you’re meant to enjoy.

No you couldn't considering there are only 2 layers at most on any server at this point.
---
Totally agree with you, but even he started his brand as a pro/high level game stream.  I think a lot of current top streams did that.  Summit1G is another good example.  Asmo is a little unique in that he was never objectively "good" at his game or any game and yet he's one of the most successful all time streamers.
---
Yes, if you happen to buy 100 subscriptions, you might go broke. Amazing point. Congratulations on winning the argument.
---
It's like the unstoppable force they're just not pushing very hard.
---
That's fine, honestly. It's literally impossible to please the ultra hardcore playerbase with an easy, 15 year old game. Pointless to try. Any new content they drop will be completed instantly. 
---
Just design around the average serious daily player, no-life players can take a break if they're that sick of MC already. The average serious player who's very into the game, but has a full time job/school, is probably somewhere between 40 and 60 ATM, spending hours every day. Actual casual players sub 40.
---
Asmongold is bad and an absolute chode but a video of 40 people rolling up and blowing 20+ sappers doesnt really demonstrate skill or lack of it by the people getting blown up
---
I actually liked the TD aspect in the short term. Also I got my first mirror this league so maybe I'm biased
---
Mind blown. So simple yet effective. TY OP!
---
Main tank got it, we didnt have any dkp to spend
---
Throw that ass in a circle. That’ll make you some coin
---
A couple of questions about warrior leveling: Is it really as bad as people say it is solo even if you are keeping up with first aid and engineering? WPvP I can understand being an issue playing solo due to a lack of dispels and kiting, do you have any tips to help bridge the gap?
---
If you are looking to make money doing runs need in dps gear (unless a dps needs) and/or do strath runs and reserver the first orb.
---
That's pretty much exactly my point.
---
Haha where my money at??????? Where my money at
---
We are what we pretend to be.
---
Pretty sure that's a quote from a pretty famous without but I'm blanking.
---
Importance doesn’t matter 
---
Have you never had this in school ? Basic marketing 
---
High demand low supply 
---
Tank is very low on supply and high in demand 
---
If a heal asks for cash you can just get a different one or for a lot of dungeons just heal without proper gear bc it actually works 
---
As I said if people buy it you can sell it 
---
If selling heal services works you can do it 
---
You can try right now, not a single soul will be harmed or bothered in any way 
---
If they buy it it’s fine if they don’t it’s fine too 
---
It’s the same as putting sth on the ah basically 
---
If your price sucks people won’t buy it 
---
Apparently there are enough people who don’t care 
---
All things aside you could reserve as a dps too 
---
The group leader can reserve an item the spec barely matters 
---
It’s just easier with a low supply role bc people are more likely to go “yeah I don’t really need the item that much I just wanna run the dungeon and get my quests done”
---
It’s baffling that anyone would be upset about it
---
I feel your pain I love the opportunity to DPS a dungeon but leveling as feral I just have focused on advertising myself as a tank. 
---
I just got wolfshead helm too and respecced to get furor!  I have at least pulled off a few 'bear powershift' when I get down to 0 rage to then pop back up to 20 =P
---
Found the gulible.
---
So you shy away from geared players and go for the lowbies ? Hm sounds like a pussy move, seems like the twink mindset tho.
---
That actually sounds really accurate.
---
I thought the song was cool what's it called
---
&gt; So yes after 3 hours with one group and winning literally nothing I was a bit salty, is that an atypical reaction?
---
Well, I'll sound like my parents saying this, but it's a game, if you're not having fun playing it, don't play it.
---
Some runs you won't win anything and some runs, you'll win more than your fair share.
---
alliance side: paladin life is very chill
---
your solo grind life is 1 macro, you press it every 10 secs 
---
no money no worries, free mount
---
The weapons off the last boss are amazing, but I can definitely see him being a big obstacle.  I don't think I ever killed him in vanilla, not sure how well people are doing Ulda in classic
---
Am I the only one bothered by those stickers? I always RIP those off as soon as I get a new tech item lol
---
 Back with another commission by /u/valdihr 
---
This time we have the Alliance side quest “The Platinum Discs”. Since I clearly have a huge dwarf bias, I wanted something very fitting to dwarven culture so this seemed to if perfect. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2279/the-platinum-discs
---
Hard to say.
---
Tailors make bags, which everyone needs and the materials are easy to acquire (just farm mobs for cloth), but the market can be a little saturated, at least right now in the early stages of Classic.
---
Everyone needs enchants, too. The hard part about Enchanting is that you can't put Enchants on the AH like you can bags. You have to advertise in trade chat and you will live off tips, since for every Enchanter that charges for their services, there is 3 that will do it for free + tips. Enchanters CAN make decent money selling materials from disenchants, though. Just know that you could have potentially made some money selling the green/ blue you disenchanted instead, so your margins are smaller than they appear.
---
One more point for tailoring is that you will be able to craft a robe that will be the best available to a healing Priest for quite some time, especially if you don't do a lot of raids, but you could drop Tailoring after getting the Robe. A lot of people do.
---
Totally lame and cringe but like the beat and I'm a sucker for a sweet female vocal
---
With the right group aoe dungeons farming is pretty quick
---
You can pull entire hallways of mobs in SM 
---
I prefer it and I think it’s quicker than questing plus most spots in the 40s are already camped by other mages
---
With this logic does that mean Keanu Reeves is a real life killer for hire? Does RDJ really fly around in a tin can? Is Tom Cruise a spy for real?
---
No of course not, they're doing something called *acting*.
---
Number 6, wait 20 seconds while tank gets 1 swing with his 2.0 speed sword on 10 mobs.... nope you can grab them back after I multi them and they are snared in my frost trap. Then I'll volley while the lock  is hellfiring. 
---
Hunters do this because good tanks allow us to. If every hunter instantly multied and then ripped 3 mobs and wiped the group do you really think we just keep doing it over and over lol?
---
Tanking is more than standing in a group of mobs and letting them hit you.
---
And remember to let her explore at her pace! As a non gamer, things that are completely natural and obvious to a gamer might be new and overwhelming/awestriking to a newbie. 
---
Good luck, and may Azeroth offer many adventures for the two of you!
---
Is there an Addon or just locations of all whipper root tuber locations? I cant seem to find anything to mark them on my map.
---
Shhh... No... You can keep it to yourself. We don't care.
---
And what exactly does fishing being optional have to do with anything? 
---
That was my first comment.
---
faked
---
I didn't say that lol I'm just saying it can go both ways depending on what classes are in your guild vs. what classes are in that given pug and how geared those players are
---
If your point is that a pug locks you in to a smaller chance to get loot week by week it's just wrong
---
1 item and ONE guild didnt help, lots of ally guilds showed up, but your narrative wouldnt work then would it.
---
That is what they are doing, BWL is part of phase 3.
---
I think that if you can dish it out but cant take it you deserve what you get
---
hmm, just reserving the first orb, i like that idea
---
I’m fire as well (gonna lean into fire/frost at some point) but I feel like you can still spellcleave! You still can use arc explosion, basic blizzard, flamestrike, cone of cold and even flame wave for Aoe, along with Scorch spamming all the mobs.
---
Bads usually don’t.  
---
Figure in your lost base mana, lost regen, lost crit, then try to factor in the “efficiency” of wearing nearly all +heal gear pre 60 .
---
That lovely view of efficiency does a hard face tank on the concrete - but I love it when people try to proponent data results based on only using partial datasets. 
---
Do go on ...

Here you go, buddy.  Its going to be okay.

As a warrior this makes me sad but that's awesome for you! How are the procs?

Raid loggers are weak. I'll NEVER understand why some people play classic for the PvE content alone. PvP is what classic is really about, idk why you'd play  something like classic if you didn't have an interest in it.

These are the people you would have been playing with!  Lmao.  You dodged a bullet there.  Good luck in your life.

Multi boxing? Reported....^/s

Run a melee group, healer now has innervate so you never need to wait for drinking.

Druids are severely underestimated while leveling.

I don't think that's the issue... aren't these servers far more overcrowded than they were during vanilla wow?

1.12 has the extra quests it shouldn't take you long if you're looking everything and vendoring

Wrong again sir! I never checked anything xD I made a statement on an aspect of american culture on an american website. Not hating on anyone :) Do i find that aspect toxic?

A dungeon once in a while isn't going to be meaningful progression compared to someone actively raiding. They are going to be severely outgeared, always.
---
Literally tons of people play the game this way. I have about 12 irl friends in their 40s right now. This is exactly what they will do when they hit 60 and bgs are out
---
This guy knows what's up
---
People keep saying this, yet I keep being top-2 damage dealer, and that's despite spending a few fights helping with healing.
---
I guess we'll see how much longer that holds, but back in vanilla I don't remember ever really falling behind.
---
Yea and there were rank 14 suckers that kept grinding in hopes that it actually existed. Not only did that waste their time, but it fucked over every other rank 13 that was waiting their turn.
---
It’s basically worthless on my server : /
---
It's cause account boosting usually comes from eastern Europe or China
---
Tanked all the way through vanilla to current retail. I leveled 2H arms tank from 16 - 60 in a week and a half. My thoughts:
---
On multiple targets, AoE DPS are going to get aggro, its gunna happen, but MARK A SKULL on the hardest hitting mob and save your sunders for that, then use your two taunts for the second hardest hitting mob that is now attacking one of your AoE DPS.
---
This isnt retail, if you want to move at a decent pace, DPS are gunna take some hits, the group has to deal with it.
---
I wouldnt say 4 months is "fast" necessarily
---
I was 50% of the dps, it was 1am and I had to work the next day. Sorry if being tired is a terrible excuse, but you seem to be making an awful lot of assumptions about me; "i said hey I'm tired an I need to go to bed". They said "okay no problem" there was no arguing and at that point I was not super upset that I had to leave anyway considering their harsh reactions to the two things I said. I had no obligation to stay and continue on just like you assume they had no obligation to communicate with me.
---
just cast flamestrike and blizzard like the other mages and nobody should notice your specced fire honestly.
---
Be a shaman, then you get 5 hearths an hour!
---
Not what I was asking, but cool.
---
StOp EnJoYiNg ThInGs I dOn'T lIkE!

Everybody who knew how to spellcleave properly is 60 by now. The only ones left are generally very bad. I wouldn't respec just to get into those groups.
---
The translation isn’t exact. In English, it would be “pegging,” search for that instead.
---
Not sure about the procrate. It feels as often as Trash Blade. But I could also be very wrong.
---
Nice 1v2 but the toxic against the afk wasn’t necessary.
---
Good guy Priest gets my upvote!
---
So you are getting offended on behalf of players on his server...?
---
The only 2 things I learned are how poorly your writing and argumentative skills are.
---
Well, you can kite him up the room before his chamber, you just need to hit that summoning stone and book it. He is a whole lot easier that way. 
---
He is definitely difficult the normal way and woulda kicked our asses had we done it that way xD 
---
Also there are some good plate gloves that drop off the Golem boss :D
---
&gt;Why the hell don't you just tank? That's what I would do if I was a warrior.
---
I have a level 34 warrior, here's my reasons why I don't like to tank:
---
1.) Stance Dancing - you lose rage while doing it, save for a few rage with the right talents.
---
2.) All useful warrior abilities are only usable in battle stance, so you lose out on damage reduction and more threat generation, while also "dancing" between stances and losing out on rage
---
3.) 1h weapon deals little damage so generates almost no rage from tiny damage hits.
---
4.) Rage starved CONSTANTLY. When you have enough rage to use a sunder, you miss or it's dodged/parried. Oh they dodged it? Nice, i'll use my overpower follow-up attack - wait, I can't because I'm not in battle stance.
---
5.) Range dps pulls aggro and runs away from you OR all dps are not targeting the Skull marked enemy so good luck getting aggro back on all the mobs running around to the range/healer, between other dps. Not to mention it's a caster so it runs to melee the healer then starts casting to you while it's far away from you.
---
6.) People think you're lazy for not wanting to tank, such as yourself because they don't understand how annoying it can be. It's already a highly stressful way to play the game - why would I want to tank and have other party members taunt me saying "Wow, learn to hold aggro better", etc.
---
Looks like a female Jesus actually.
---
There are tons of videos on youtube of how to do it. Search for Hunter Mara Princess farm or something.
---
For the Horde brother
---
I believe it’s just the damage value from rend. Try using sweeping strikes + whirlwind (or cleave if not high enough for WW) for threat generation
---
Truth. If you're investing 8+ hours a day you need to understand your opinion and play style is not the majority and should be taken with a grain of salt.
---
You seem awfully defensive about such an insignificant issue. I was happy having a back-and-forth discussion, but I guess this is the hill you want to die on?
---
That phat thorns damage! And Crit Chance for your hots! Got dayum
---
Holy triggered snowflake Batman!
---
Simple solution: make your own groups.
---
your poor ass, sitting on hard wooden bench for 8+ hours game session..
---
That is going to hurt.
---
Even random level 31 pieces of leather with useless stats?  Who's buying these significantly above vendor markups?  Certainly no one leveling
---
If you dont mind a tip.... Dont overwhelm her. You're going to want to teach her things, don't. Let her ask first. Let her struggle a bit. One of the things I think WoW does a great job of is teaching you about your character. If you're like me, you're going to want to be like Aladdin, put her on your magic carpet and singing "I can show you the world!" Resist ! There will be the right time to point out this or that. Don't rush her. Let her dance for 10 minutes, or look at stupid stuff. Just enjoy the time together, and don't worry if she's not leveling. 
---
I was in a rush to teach, and to get her leveled to do a dungeon or things I thought she'd think was fun. Don't do that. Let her make her own path. Let her know that you'll answer any questions she has, but let her ask. She'll remember more that way - cuz she'll be interested in the question, rather than bombing her with shit she probably doesn't need to know yet.
---
I've watched him pvp on his stream multiple times, this video is not my only source material.
---
*cries in hunter*
---
With cheetah / pack youre faster than her. Your auto shots outrange her boulder. At all times you want to be far enough away from her that when she starts casting boulder, you outrange it but hit her with more auto shots. This is how you gain distance. If you fk up and get hit by boulder, the stun hits you before the dmg actually does, so you need to react and turn off your aspect so you dont get dazed (you can still do this while stunned). As soon as youre unstunned toggle it back on. Finding your range sweet spot is the most important part of the fight, you dont even need a pet.
---
So if you are looking into it, a perfect example is with intel's server processors

---
It would be far more ecomonical to pick the more cores option and stuff them into boxes and run realms off of it.
---
But I would wager in order to properly support more players in one place, you need the higher clocked stuff, which have lower core count.
---
Large if factual
---
You misspelled hero's.

I can't imagine why you wouldn't take the trinket.

There are very few dps warrior items from mc...
---
If you mean devouring plague, it depends on the circumstance. Solo pvp and some pve its amazing. Group pvp its dispelled relatively quickly. Troll on the other hand falls behind a little in solo pvp, but really shines in group. Which is why I went troll even though ud look way better, I never find myself in a 1v1,
---
Not sure why you are being downvoted. Those are his two main attributes.
---
And I would remove PvP (and PvP servers) completely because it causes more ganking and griefing. That would make it more fun for me. (Also, carebear-players are better people than PvP-players.)
---
Not a single lag spike or any loss in FPS. 
---
You're really living the dream...
---
Lol yup had to go back.
---
Then obviously an MMO isnt it for you, even one that you want to revisit. You made your decision to not even buy it or play it. A post about NOT getting Wow classic is really pointless to even make, no one cares.
---
Didn't buy from AH, didn't buy a lot of spells... still barely halfway there at 44. Can't sell a damn thing on the AH, everything is cut down to vendor price or lower. Oh right, two blue drops but nothing anyone actually wants. lol
---
If not for Ghost Wolf I might be losing it.
---
You are not forgiven
---
Yeah i just don't see the point in caring if you don't like him cool i respect that. But some people have an unhealthy opssession at getting heated about him
---
It's not worth the effort to try and win hearts and minds as a druid.  Just run dungeons as whatever needs filled and need on everything equippable because you do everything.
---
I've put a lot of effort into trying to effectively farm her, it's simply not possible. You can kill her but doing it consistently in a reasonable amount of time is not doable.
---
Now, the way to kill her is simple: You do the kite method with Cheetah (not Pack) and you cannot have beastial swiftness.
---
Just run in circles and hope she throws a rock, then you outrange the rock to cancel and use her stand still time to get in an auto + multi.
---
While you're running in circles you send in your pet (without using dash/dive) and as soon as it hits her you set it to follow, this will cause your pet to keep chasing you on top of her, which fulfills the "target in melee" requirement for her to start farting, when she does that you get a bit more time to hit her.
---
It takes forever unless you get lucky with her never deciding to randomly thrash your pet
---
pvp and pve, troll is just so strong. Sure we dont have a fear break but blackout procs from shadow guard with a  mortal strike
---
Depending on the server, AH is kinda fucked right now. People are undercutting to ludicrous levels and no one has any gold so a lot of common/uncommon drops, materials, and profession items are selling for about vendor pricing anyway. 
---
If you're making a profit putting 80% of your drops and mats on the AH, more power to you. But I think for most players for the next couple of weeks it would be more efficient to vendor 80% of their crap, AH the top 20% of hard to find mats and BoE blues and purps.
---
Check GatherMate? Might take some searching but there has to be an old import of data for that.
---
You get an effectively larger mana pool due to down ranking the spells than you would for just stacking int. The returns are higher.
---
Lol ur guild is retarded
---
How can you flask for MC but not as a joke?
---
Which ones get nothing?
---
Who is being treated terribly?
---
Play a shaman, get that horde perspective and have the two exclusive classes at 60
---
I haven't either. If I've died to an equal level opponent I will gain zero satisfaction in jumping on a character 20-40 levels higher to kill them.
---
100% this.
---
I know, I listed them in my other comment. There are 6 in MC (besides the ranged weapons and flameguard guantlets) and 1 in Ony and we've seen a pair of bracers 1 time.
---
I don't think that's really accurate or fair to the many mechanically good players who have responsibilities and just dont play wow as much as some teenage twitch speedster.
---
Tough Scorpid gear comes from leatherworking.  Recipes are dropped by Wastewanders in Tanaris.  All of it is mail with agility and spirit.  It should suffice until you can find something better.
---
On my server the recipes are really cheap, and the gear itself is relatively scarce on the AH.

What’s your class though...you still haven’t answered that for whatever reason. MS over OS but OS still gets to roll over greed. 
---
Glad to hear you communicated with them about leaving. To many people just ditch groups after specific bosses. 
---
And they did communicate with you...MS over OS. OS over vendoring. The pally and the Druid both claimed they needed that gear for a separate spec. You wanted it to sell. They get the gear you don’t.

No. Not 100subs. It's called budgeting and not throwing away $4 every time because it's "only$4".

because they are clicking their abilities

because they cannot type

because they started that way and dont want to learn a different way

why are we using keyboards that were made for professional typists and programmers?  who the fuck types anymore?  why are there all these buttons on this keyboard and why dont they line up in any sensible way?
---
get a gamepad and some foot pedals if you cant type.  change your game life

i cant type...

thanks dude! there's a great grind spot I found in Feralas, the northwestern tip of the Isle of Dread. Bunch of level 43-45 naga that are really squishy, can grind for greens / junk / Golden Pearls (selling for about 7g ea on Sulfuras atm).   
---
You'll get there!
---
Thank you, its the Leatrix plus classic addon
---
I remember this being in game in Burning crusade when I was doing arenas, was spellbatching already implemented then? Like I clearly remember casting greater heal and spamming the water to sit right after and drink in combat.

Is he in the wrong by asking - no.  He's in the wrong by continuing to ask multiple times about gear that can absolutely be used for off-spec.  Does someone have to explain why then need a piece of gear they can wear every time they hit need? Especially when it's BoP so the alternative is someone vendoring it?
---
handed those in yesterday, the dwarf was so excided about seeing the titans.
---
I wanted to be like "listen bub, you want to hear about titans, let me tell you about titans..."
---
is [willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com) still the best place to go for my addons?
---
Fire Nova is a big burst of damage with a cooldown, and Magma is consistent pulses of damage. So I'll drop Fire Nova, and then drop a Magma after it goes off if the mobs still have a lot of health left.
---
Highly recommend setting up some quality of life addons for her and remapping her keybinds.

My gf hated it from the start and I don’t blame her — it’s a nightmare playing WoW classic with just the basic settings.

Good luck!

OBOOOOOOOOOO (Wait, are we in Molten Core?)
---
That has nothing to do with how challenging the raid is.
---
What were your professions? I burned through a lot of mats with tailoring and tried to keep up my enchanting during leveling but had to stop DE'ing greens around level 25 since it was throwing so much money down the sink. Still hurt my wallet, though. 
---
I imagine people who mostly ignored professions or ran gathering professions had an easier time having gold at 40 versus people with crafting professions.
---
If a warlock is doing the lowest damage in a mid level dungeon, either something is very very wrong or the other two dps are amazing.

Or be a druid... and have to wait 9:04 for your character to fly back to Thunder Bluff from Moonglade...

At least it's free.

Nah, Spinal and Onslaught is peak rag loot.

If you run away from mobs while hitting A and D to slightly turn, the mobs will turn a LOT more. You can avoid taking pretty much any damage if they are melee. 
---
I used this trick as a level 5 running thru wetlands to get the level 20+ Crocs to not even hit me.

There is even a YouTube video about it I saw before. Basically just run away and zig zag a little and watch the weird path the NPC takes

You can use consumables that increase your damage to make your swings (and Rage gains) bigger or more reliable, Rage pots to straight up recover some extra Rage, get stronger weapons...ultimately its still down to RNG. 
---
If you critically hit your swings, you will be overflowing with Rage.
---
If you miss them instead, you won't even have enough rage to BT + WW.

Good luck! :D

When would be good to switch to DW fury? I am 60 with 7% hit and gatorbite axe as arms; the one handers I have are tooth of eranikus and thrash blade (am not orc or human). Should I wait for better weapons or more hit or am I good to switch now? Thank you
---
For one, the infamous "Need/greed" event that covered the subreddit a few days ago.  If Asmon gives the green light for ninja looting or advocates that his guilds do specific things, then his masses of followers and guild members will be doing just that.  You don't need to be a part of his group or even run into him for that to influence your game.
---
Asmon has a ton of money at this point.  He can easily have people start price fixing in the AH.  Not saying he will or that he has.  Simply that he has the manpower and the money to do it.
---
Depending on what 'drama' he wants to have for his stream or followers, he can easily work with the opposite faction to cause surprises or other unexpected PvP.
---
And this is without specifically targetting players or groups.  Imagine if Asmon says that X is blacklisted or is now going to be hunted by the opposite faction heavily.  There is a lot that can happen when a few people have sway or influence over a large community.
---
These are just examples.  The real world impacts of any player are numerous and vast.  Moreso when someone can cause hundreds more people show up at specific locations without trying.
---
When using the biggest heals to keep the tank maxed for the longest time is viable, spirit is absolutely king because the out-of-combat regen puts any other efficiency mechanic to shame. For everything up to ST, this was the strategy and everything was a boring cake walk.
---
I've run BRD a few times now with different tanks, and the situation has changed. Tanks are getting chunked, especially with fire elementals and casters. I rarely get to chill for 5 seconds to start the big regen. AoE damage is starting to get more prevalent, especially as pulls start having 5+ mobs and CCs are still pretty rare. Tossing down-ranked renews on dps and spamming Heal with the occasional Greater Heal on tanks has been what's keeping everyone up (hell on Argelmach I had to spam Greater Heal just to keep the poor druid alive).
---
Now, obviously you shouldn't dump all your spirit and int for healing, but it's definitely worth putting in your itemization now. For instance, 1 point for spirit, 0.75 for int, and 0.5 for +healing. The weird part about WoW itemization scaling though is that +healing values start scaling way faster than int or spirit post 50. It doesn't help that a lot of cloth starts stacking int and stam because early WoW items thought spirit was a bit useless.
---
I could waste my time explaining, computing, and even demonstrating my point, but you'll keep moving goal posts and refuse to address much of anything. So let me ask you instead, how do YOU come to the conclusion that +healing isn't worth the loss of max mana, regen, etc? Is there math you've done? Is there any objective standard? Are you just talking out your ass through "my experience"? Are you actually just not good enough to utilize +healing gear properly?
---
I know that when you first install a new addon it will usually enable it self by default across all characters. But from what I've noticed if you then go to the Addons menu on the character screen and uncheck that addon for specific characters then it should not turn itself back on again. Not sure if that helps at all!
---
Maybe so but at least they don't pull aggro and can self heal (and emergency offtank) themselves.
---
I'd rather replace a couple higher dps who pull aggro with feral dps any day. The utility would make the raid smoother than unnecessarily higher dps that pull aggro and require a couple rezzes on trash
---
I've seen a friggen hunter pull aggro in Ony.. a class with a friggen aggro wipe

I farmed an extra ten gold as a warrior because I was convinced I needed 100g......

You’d run out of free time way before you run over your budget. 10 hours of free time spent playing WoW a month is a steal compared to any other entertainment option available. I don’t understand why you aren’t getting that.
---
As a tank who tends to group with trigger happy dps, mark a caster enemy with a skull and dont bother tanking it, let them burst it down while you build threat on other targets. The dps can tank most caster mobs at 60. If they are pulling agro of one target, taunt =&gt; stun =&gt; mocking blow =&gt; taunt can shut one target down quite good while you build threat on the other targets. Suppose what im saying is that on AoE pulls it can be benefitial to drop one target in trade for keeping the rest. 
---
Also for the best threat per rage use revenge on first prio, then shield slam and only sunder armor as a backup.
---
Hell yeah it does.
---
I did this for all of SM. Makes it way easier when mobs don't go off running and pulling more
---
such a corporate speak way of saying I lead 39 other sweaty dorito fingered mountain dew chugging potatos to kill some fat flappy dragons
---
I love it
---
I feel like the ppl that lost low bid number bid against you themselves to up their price and not let u get for cheap. Or they just cancel it
---
This is awesome.
---
I got Ironfoe on my Priest once, simply because the tank was a Druid and the DPS were mage/warlock/hunter, so we just greed rolled it.
---
Would equip it and stand on the IF bridge, and get so many seething whispers from warriors and rogues, crying that I was a "ninja".
---
Fun times.
---
Ok, fair enough. The MAIN reason to play undead is the 60 mount.

It really doesn't matter where they are. I used to use an addon to arrange them like my keyboard but now I'm just assigning them Willy nilly and I can't tell the difference.

Only issue I've had is after a boulder, she might commit to a side, be ready to to fully commit to running the opposite side.

I also place my imp behind where she kites back and forth, by the golems, so if the imp pulls she's still behind the rock relative to me rather than running off to the side.

Hey it is classic

No it is not.

I mean, it's BiS for the first 4 phases for warriors. It sells for like 3g.
---
99% sure somebody just saw it was epic and was under the impression everyone would need because they assumed it was BoE, OR they just missed that it was mail. Screenshots indicate Extasi may have rolled for the BoE reason. He saw a warrior roll for mail (something that maybe a new player would interpret as a "oh, he rolled for something he can't wear, i should too because it's probably worht a lot!). The "oh shit" also maybe looks like the "oh, it's BoP" realization.  He clearly didn't think warriors used it because it was mail.
---
Maybe he thought the warrior was ninjaing, and so he rolled to counter that..
---
You can't really be mad at people for being bad at the game though. It's your fault for playing with randoms.
---
As a war tank, very tempted to wear those aa well.  I plan on getting them this weekend. Just started running BRD last night, got the key right before going to bed, but not completed all the quests yet.

This is an awesome service &amp; I would pay 1g for conjured mineral water every day (100 of them) &amp; then once I'm 45 the higher level stuff

It isn't about hitting soft cap. Each % of hit you get greatly increases your dps.
---
I don't think it does
---
Same here. I have an 18, 22, and 23. Almost every free moment goes into the game. But based on my progress, apparently I'm only a casual. That's almost insulting lol.
---
It very much is preraid BiS, you won't replace it until BWL at least.
---
I just leveled normally. I didn't grind at all. I ran each SM wing 2-4 times overall, mostly to knock out quests. I hit most of the level-appropriate zones.
---
I don't think he means it quite like that either tho. 
---
I'm a prot pally, why the hell is any DPS AoE-ing before I lay down consecration? Why? I'm asking for 5 seconds, max. And in those 5 seconds hit the mob I already marked while everyone lets cons build up aggro. Not only that, the marked target already is aggroed to the tank. So go after the mark target and after a couple of secs of cons, go wild with your AoE.
---
Could you elaborate on Rotgrip? Or if you have a video that shows it that would be best.
---
i think you need 35 for full profession
---
Quest don't give full rep but donn't give you zero either. The rep is pretty minor. If you did it in the level range it would be 75 rep. Above level range it is 5 i believe. Best to do cloth. But saying that...epic Forsaken horse looks heaps better then the wolf.
---
I'm not going to do both talents at 5/5 since I want spiritual focus.
---
I need both strength &amp; intellect so I am splitting 3 and 2.
---
The loot stays on the mob, and the first person to manually loot it gets it
---
It's happening with a fresh shield. And consistent through the shield. I get the absorb but still get spell kick back. It's weird to me because it doesn't happen on every shield.
---
Since rested builds based on percent of a level and leveling is actually hard XP numbers it's very easy to keep up with 8-10 alts in the early levels. However once they get higher level it gets harder and harder to keep up.  
---
In vanilla I leveled several at a time with no problem, but I also was able to play many more hours a day than I can now. Still, I'm trying it with 8 characters this time. It's really easy right now to keep up even with my limited playtime but I can see it being more problematic as I get everyone closer to 60.
---
Because really good mages know the best thing to do is run in and spam Arcane Explosion right?
---
Well?  Did you bulk or cut?

You live on to tell his tale

This is the most tumblr shit I’ve read in a long time tbh
---
Along with the other comments, I'll add that the 2h sword off the last boss in Ulda is also super nice. Think it has 200+ top end dmg with a proc that increases physical dmg. Maybe not quite as nice as the 2% crit from the mace off the same boss, but I remember getting the sword back in the day and it hit like a truck. Also the sword spec is worth taking if you get this weapon, but you may end up just respecing axes in like 7-10 levels.

That may be true, but luckily you can DE anything at with a level 5 character in Classic

That’s interesting and totally understandable. Oddly enough, in vanilla UBRS groups without masterloot were not to be trusted.

Edit: grammar.

I love reposts
---
Phase 2 won’t bring much that requires you to be 60 and it also won’t make everything that’s currently out, dead content.
---
Until you add in the amount of time you’ve saved corpse running from being ganked because you had a shield that let you win the fight.

You will have to compete with mages for gear but your tier sets will be very easy to obtain and look great.

Go to shimmering flats right at 30. Plenty of quests all in one place. You can also do hillsbrad. IMO do the start of STV, until all the quests are orange. Then you can come back in the late 30s.
---
One more reason to go to shimmering flats - lots of quests there lead into STV quests
---
But I can't let that one go unnoticed, jee you are a ugly one Sir. Rofl
---
I don't believe elites have any higher stealth detection than non elites but I could be wrong.  Only certain mob types have higher stealth detection such as hounds.
---
I don’t think it’s a good idea. Granted it won’t be a big deal. Sm/ruin is a raiding/pvp spec.
---
Dark pact is for leveling due to mana efficiency. If you’re solo leveling, you’re likely just slowing yourself down needing to drink/eat more often.
---
Did shaman to death in Vanilla.
---
Consider this.
---
Even if you have a really bad tank, the dungeon can run smoother with sensible dps than if you have a pro tank and mediocre dps who don't understand threat.
---
can I set this to count other things as well? Like your frostbolt counter?
---
Me, a mediocre mage, trying to farm like JokerD
---
I made a little lvl 4 mage just to conjure water at the starter area to hand out to all the other Gnomes and Dwarves.
---
I just make full stacks over time and when I see someone, I whisper them or open a trade window. Hopefully it helps them out.
---
Might do the same on Horde side as well.
---
I KNEW IT. I been so confused seeing mage bis lists like "I dont remember this much plus damage" the damage gear I had was greens "of frost damage" and the rest was arcanist for stats. 8 slots all with at least +20 damage on it means the average mage today is worth at least double what a vanilla mage was and that's not including the difference in game knowledge and experience with then vs now.
---
Theres no 300 riding skill in the game tho... just a 900g epic mount.

But what to expect from a company that cant code a keyring or a working execute for warriors.

Word of advice:

Buy external keyboards and DO NOT USE THE KEYBOARD ON THE LAPTOP!

Your wrists are going to be KILLING after about an hour or so, and it's going to make her not want to play. Take out as many bad variables as possible!

---
Much love amigo :-)
---
I didn't get any major drops, just the usual from running level-appropriate dungeons 1-3 times each. I have mining and engineering, but I've used my mining mats to level engineering and vendored most of those items. All of my guild-mates had similar amounts of gold when they hit 40, and they didn't grind or play the AH. The average player should be able to reach 90g relatively easily.
---
Also another good trick is ghetto hearthing when your hearth is on cooldown by joining a group, entering an instance and then leaving that group. It will teleport you to wherever you set your hearth.
---
its true tho?
---
As a lock, weave your taps in-between other spells. Don't wait till you're out of Mana than tap 5 times in a row. Aim to tap to keep your Mana up, not from bottoming out.
---
Healers are scanning Heath bars, not the battlefield. When you go from full health to half health (or lower) they think you're dying from a mob and will waste time and Mana with regular heals. If it drops from time to time, they'll know you're tapping and will toss on a renew.
---
I did, but searching for solution for this issue I disabled it. Have restarted wow after disabling too.
---
You've got some problems.
---
if only, the game rolls again between the people who tied but this isn't visible
---
Is that a bench you're sitting on? Looks uncomfortable. Hope the children are old enough to make hot pockets for you all!
---
Yep this works really well. Let's me know if someone on my kis list is around and shows me what reason I set it for
---
I’m a priest and I easily had enough for my mount at 40. Just heal SM Armory and Cath for a few days and you’ll get the money in no time. I didn’t do a single quest between level 30 and 40. Just spammed SM the whole time. I Don’t even have professions yet because I’m not farming without a mount and you can power level any profession in a few days at max level.
---
Are you talking about cookies cove?

Wait... How?

So does that mean this would work or you need exalted to use it as well as buy?

It's actually just you. All us warriors got together with Blizzard and decided to increase your chance to be parried.

Sounds like my kind of guild. No pressure, no commitment, just some dudes looking for other cool dudes to hang out in their party mansion. Nothing sexual.
---
Very wrong
---
Thank you for this response! I appreciate that you took the time to type it up.
---
I think my tank was okay with the other warrior having threat, but the other warrior wasn't okay with it, mostly because he was, you know, dying when he got it. He was lower leveled than us (48 I think) so that might have contributed somewhat. The healer was a feral druid and that might have been part of that issue: he had long cast times and then had to deal with knockbacks and stuff like that (lashers) that interrupted his cast, and then could only save one target. He probably could have done better (downranking on those fights to avoid overheal while still getting some healing out there before it was an issue, drinking as soon as we exited combat, etc etc) but it seemed like the healer felt forced to choose one target to heal and that led to people dying (and then having to run back while we waited and cleaned up).
---
I think it's hard to get into that mindset of 'they have threat and it's okay' though. It's been the meta in WoW for many years to always have threat (and easily, since MoP) and the job of a tank is to know when to use different defensive cooldowns. Unfortunately at this point there's only so much you can do, and in our case, that DPS just couldn't deal with the concept of the tank not always having threat. I try to help if healers pull it (I have that mage CC after all, and like you said, if they're stumbling after me, they're not hitting anyone), but I also don't get mad when I get threat... I just assume it's my fault.
---
He tried cleaving some packs but that didn't go well iirc. I'll have to watch the stream of that part again to remember exactly what happened. Seemed like too much damage was going out and the other warrior was getting aggro just the same as always.
---
He does have at least one point in tactical mastery right now, though. He's been looking forward to that and trying to do the kind of stance thing you're talking about, but I'll show him this and hopefully it'll be helpful! Thanks also for the bit about mocking blow. He was getting beat to shit and the second he had aggro on both giants the healer couldn't keep him up even with shield block (? wall?) up, so I felt like they just hit so hard going out of defensive was a bad choice and it might have been better to split the damage. I could see where on mobs that aren't beating you to death in a few hits it would be useful; I guess it goes back to what you were saying about making a choice as to when it's smart to get aggro vs. letting a dps have it.
---
Thanks again for your advice. I really appreciate it!
---
I'm not crying about anything. I'm just replying. Why can't you just move along instead of "crying about someone" replying to you?
---
What’s the point of playing on Faerlina if you aren’t playing with asmongold?

I was making a joke about how hes a scummy ninja looter... jeez
---
I was following the Wowhead feral guide with 5 in furor. I'm usually in cat.. but now I see I should try bear more
---
Most people reccomend leveling with 2 gathering proffessions and then dropping at least one at max level for a crafting one.
---
You could go skinning for a small but consistent amount of money while leveling, and then drop it for blacksmithing or engineering.
---
Fuck felcloth and essence of fire.
---
You probably won't make a lot of money with enchanting at the moment as the market is super saturated and people don't tend to have much money.
---
My suggestion would be level your tailoring all the way up, and you can make money off of mooncloth at 250, and also make your BoP Purple robe at 60. Once you've made the robe, you can  drop tailoring and pick up engineering. I wouldn't pick up engineering right yet.
---
It might also be possible to skip mining at the moment, since prices on the AH are so incredibly cheap.
---
Guildie sold one for 100g in about 30 seconds on Rattlegore.  I have one in my bank that I will seriously start selling in mid p2.
---
Or you can google "WoW Classic Texas hold em addon"
---
Click the WowInterface.com one...

Tada...

you're acting like this is a new game, its not lol

I'll stick to my smooth as fuck regular runs with a normal tank that takes 10 minutes longer than an assblast megacleave run thanks

Wow. You seem surprisingly angry that I asked a question.
---
This is wow classic, if you want the classic experience you need more jpeg
---
Your abilities are dickshaped
---
No.  The population of a server is linked to the total number of people on the server, not on any specific layer.  Could Blizzard be lying to us?  I guess, but that's just paranoid.
---
What kills me is when the healer is drinking at 20% and I sit down (to show I'm waiting), and the mage goes and pulls for me since I'm not doing it.
---
Yes, the raid sets are all class specific.
---
I see you found my secret happy place. Don't forget to cup the shore.
---
One thing that people don't mention that may seriously hurt your ability to get a mount at 40 is if you don't play that often, and log off in inns. The rested bonus will really make your leveling outpace your gold making. If you level with rested bonus most of the time, getting a mount at 40 may be impossible.
---
Another possible issue is if you do too many instances. If you spend a lot of time in SM, you'll make very little gold while getting tons of exp, and if you play certain classes you may even lose money if you don't get a mage in your group.
---
Believe it or not, a 6 minute cooldown that effectively regens mana as fast as drinking but works in combat does not make up for the negatives of taking a druid over a mage or warrior.
---
Sm is not great for money IMO.
---
You get most of your money from quest rewards
---
It's like that for the Succubus too.

That. Or they lowered realm caps. Which is possible based off recent blue posts.
---
'' you are higher level than me, therefor you rushed to 60, therefor it's your fault if you notice the huge lack of content classic has at endgame''.

This is the post to read.

Also, Berserker rage should make you immune to gouge.

Hence why I call him Blueboi. Greatest boy of the BOYS!!!!
---
Excuse my ignorance but wouldn't this essentially be the same thing as remotely playing WoW through RDP or Chrome which people get banned for?
---
curseforge is pretty up to date now, but willitclassic does a good job of pulling up fan updates or addons only hosted on wowinterface or github.
---
After each knockback you have to have the MT go in alone and reestablish threat before any melee even get back into range
---
Man you are quite the screenshot engineer
---
Yep, that's generally how meaningful dialogue happens. :) The problem is when strangers get worked up over nothing instead of talking it out like adults.
---
How were you so poor at 40 to begin?
---
Lv50s will, which will have 0 chance
---
I heard that comment
---
Does fury have SS? I thought that was an arms thing... (But I don't know anything about warrior dps.)
---
He's pretty much doing what you're saying about berserker's rage and then charge, but I think he might open with something different. I could see where WW would get some snap aggro, so I'll suggest he consider it!
---
I wish I could get my boyfriend to join me.
---
Who cares?
---
Mobs can still detect you while in stealth. Best practice is to get a little distance then vanish.
---
Mine gets to the end of the que then errors out and doesn't log in
---
Same way the continents aren’t correctly sized. It’s a perspective/viewing thing not a factual actual map lol. Zoom in for that people!
---
there's an 8 minute que just to log into the battlenet launcher right now. something broke somewhere.
---
edit: says 17 minutes now.
---
I'm agreeing with the OP, so I'm not sure what you are arguing about.
---
I do
---
There is no PvP yet though except for griefing people on their way into the Blackrock dungeons. That's why I'm so disappointed that P2 is still quite a bit off, since I would gladly farm honor.
---
No one cares.
---
Hell, they don’t even know LFG exists.
---
And now your trolling has gotten boring *yawn* Have a good day random angry american!
---
Id suggest this. I went for the BSing route right away, like I've done with all the warriors I make, and I regret it immensely every single time. Go with mining and skinning, make the ore into bars and send them to a bank alt. vendor/ah/send it to a LW the leather.
---
lol what the fuck never saw that
---
not even a little!
---
IKR!
---
Not sure why this post has been removed but w/e
---
I cant even open the blizzard launcher. Been stuck on 1 min estimated wait for about 15 minutes now.
---
That's way to long without battlegrounds with how people are now, and how good we know the rewards to be though
---
I’m scares to think what you could do with unlimited characters
---
I guess, man. But it feels like that's something any WoW streamer could do. Maybe not.
---
Maybe you should speak with your therapist about your irrational anger issues then?
---
I think the login servers went down. my blizzard launcher wont connect
---
Try the forums, it’s the only thing I can think of. They’ll go into detail and see what’s going on for you. The forum helpers will say “lul gotta appeal it can’t be done here”. But everytime the blues there will look into it, just don’t argue with them forum “helpers”.
---
You’re not doing anything against the TOS, so there will be no penalty. It’s purely to stop the account from being playable until the actual owner can recover it.

Doesn’t asmon have his own sub reddit?

Mine too
---
Level 25 here. Me too buddy. We’re gonna get our butts stomped in Phase 2...
---
Same happens to my bank alt, and I have no addons. Don't listen to the fools saying it's your fault.
---
He pulls like 40k viewers every time he streams, do you really think no one will post about him
---
I see you've chosen horde.  Your lady is very unlike mine, who has made 5 different gnomes and is levelling all of them.
---
Would you want two of the rings ideally or do they not stack well?
---
In before OP makes a post saying they were banned for RMT
---
Healer was a feral druid, so he was running out of mana really fast... I could see where he was trying to wait for 5SR and all that, which forced him to wait until really low health to cast a bit heal sometimes, but obviously stuff was living so long he got drained by it. 
---
I was annoyed that he wasn't drinking every pull tbh. I park my ass the second I exit combat because my mana bar could be the difference between a wipe or not, and that's just as a DPS. As a healer it's even more important. 
---
But some of the hits he was taking were wild. Made him afraid to use his (sorta outdated?) 2H.
---
Yeah, something broke for sure.
---
That's a great idea tbh.
---
Rogues dont need gear ? Lul
---
I got mine at 41.  
---
For anyone struggling heres a tip:  farm the lv 38-39 elementals in arathi highlands. 
---
Look on your ah for the charms that drop from the elementals in arathi highlands. There are three different ones. If there is a shortage of one of them then you’re in luck.  On my server there were 0 cresting charms on the ah and I was able to sell them for 80s each.  TSM said the market value was 66S. All 50 of them sold in less than 48 hours too.  I put 25 up and they sold in a day then I put the other 25 up and they sold in a day too. 
---
Farming the elementals got me half of the gold for my mount in two hours. Plus I was getting exp the whole time.  I was lv 40 when I started farming and 41 when I finished.  The drop rate is about 20-35%I would say. Definitely not %50 like wowhead says. 
---
Not sure why people pay so much for them but yeah I made 40G in two hours and leveled my character.
---
TFW you're waiting in queue for login servers to log into the hinterlands inn where I have accumulated 0 rested experience
---
Was the Succubus' damage nerfed in later expansions?
---
I can't wrap my head around it's high popularity in Classic while in every xpac I know it was only useful for Charming in PvP and it was just plain inferior to the Imp in every conceivable way in PvE.
---
https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/windows.html
---
Right, but blessing of light gives a bunch of plus heal.  Rank 1 being up to 60 for FoL and and up to 210 for HL.  I guess the real question is: does “up to” mean that it will be roughly equivalent increase when you down rank, or is it like it adds 50-60 to any rank of FoL.
---
Lol you're waiting behind yourself.   Better stay at that computer - wouldn't want to lose your spot would you?
---
I waited in queue, got to first in line and right before ready to login: Disconnected
---
Oof...
---
Yeah, seems like something is up, not even many in line but the queue time is pretty big.
---
Now it's up to 33min wait just to open the launcher.
---
or account sharers who dont get caught
---
small indie company
---
How have I " deflected/dodged " any of your points?
---
your only point is that it takes longer to level? it doesn't and I addressed that already.
---
a single multi-box will get your 2 characters to 60 faster than leveling to 60 twice individually and it scales with the more boxes you have.  (more money spent on accounts == advantage in game)  end of story.
---
I'm not coming back to this comment since we've already given our viewpoint multiple times and you just resort to playground name-calling thinking it gives you a stronger argument.
---
feel free to have the last word.
---
Yea I'm in queue only to be disconnected the moment I get in....  so this is awesome.
---
I wish I could get a boyfriend.

I just got a 12m queue for the launcher lmao.

---
Trolls in mid STV, if they're not totally camped. They drop wildvine which can sell on AH for a gold a pop, a fair amount of silver and high cost grays.
---
Mostly though just level. The higher level you go the more the mobs will drop and it will get quicker.
---
Yeah, I'm sorry, please no one watch any of skarms videos. Nothing about tanking in raids can be applied to tanking in general. He never mentions anything except speed running. If you have trouble with tanking just get a thunderfury idiot. 
---
Maybe instead of linking titles of videos, watch them. Skarm goes on tangents constantly, he doesnt script his videos at all. He talks about all sorts of tanking stuff in all his videos. He often talks about leveling dungeons and on his stream he is literally leveling a warrior in dungeons because his druid was banned for 7 days. 
---
Your position makes 0 sense.
---
And mine too.
---
He’s saying he personally doesn’t like that you’re sharing game related pictures on a subreddit created in order to share things like your game related picture.

He’s being an ass.

Pvp or pve

yea bro they say undead is mandatory for pvp but i think theyre trash because a common sense min/max will take troll berserk in combination with power infusion and make a nice oh shit macro.

But on my mage i play undead for wotf
---
Orc Warlock is just insane though since the racial also screws with rogues.
---
The 99% you see are more like 10-25% of the total. Most people can't afford it until high 40s when income is higher. I bought mine with 51, and I was broke with 48.

I laughed at this. what I hope is a dart commentator reference

Oh lol, just got caught up. Hopefully it’s fixed soon.

lmao "you could do something if it were possible" You got me there man. I can't argue with cold hard **facts** like "Blizzard is lying and I have no proof."
---

---
Uuuh, what?
---
crying? I've been laughing and criticizing them. Just because you say I'm whining doesn't mean I am.
---
Had a tank run Strat for my group once, he wanted all blues/greens that no one needed. If you needed it, fine, no problem. As a warrior I had no problem with it. I understand. My mage friend was *livid*. Absolutely hated the guy and thought he was being a cheap and unfair bastard. Mages complaining about other people making money, amirite?
---
I just got to 30 as a prot sword &amp; board warrior and have found that trying to keep threat on everything when everything is orange or red is futile, thanks to how infrequently I hit. I find in these situations with groups it can be better to mark a skull and only worry about building threat on enemies that aren't the current dps target, and hit the skull with taunt when it's available. It puts more pressure on the healer, but at least there's only one loose mob, and there's usually a melee who can soak the damage not-terribly. 
---
I've started only doing dungeons with mostly yellow mobs, as then there's no trouble with threat. I'll definitely be looking into this 2h tanking idea though.
---
For the horde !
---
Abandon quest and reobtain from questgiver.
---
The only people getting this rank would be professional gold sellers who have an army of employees to swap between.  Then they would sell the account.
---
Yeah, as Warlock, dots and wanding is often enough to stay near the top of the DPs charts at lvl 45ish

---
No.  You can get another 10% if you get to Rank 3 in PvP, but that won't be available until Phase 2, obviously.
---
God damn imagine having 8 piece tier sets In retail

Kromcrush is a pretty balanced server (Horde/Alliance ratio) with a high population that will occasionally have queue times but most of the time there is no wait. I started on Herod and the queues were so bad I couldn't play some days. Kromcrush seems almost perfect.
---
couple hours ago i came out of an instance and some players were talking that they had been ddos out of the game and had had a long que back in.  i have no idea as to the accuracy of their statements
---
Undead vs troll in a 1v1 undead all day. But people sleep on the power of da voodoo
---
Druid tanks are 100% viable, especially if you're aware of your strengths and weaknesses going in. In 5- and 10-man dungeons, you reign supreme. In certain raid encounters, you're better suited to MT than a warrior (Patchwerk, for instance). But, in many cases, you'll be the OT gathering adds, DPSing in cat gear, or off-healing.
---
Druids provide a really rich, wholesome experience in Classic. A true hybrid class that has the potential to excel in at least two areas.
---
I've lost 5-10lb since classic came out. Opposite of what I expected, but I skip dinner almost nightly to grind
---
I'm jelly of the locks mount. Looks sick.
---
I have sent a friend request. We might not be able to level together, but general conversation sounds nice as well.
---
This map also contains both the island of doctor lapidis and gillijim's isle, that are West of stranglethorn. They were there in the alpha but removed later.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Island_of_Doctor_Lapidis
---
I love it.
---
Just tank, you'll get more groups that way.
---
Without TacMast, you can still use TClap as an AoE aggro generator/mitigation after charging and before stance changing. You’ll probably still lose some Rage, though.
---
You mean having 3 active warlocks?
---
There is an *incredible* amount of photoshop in the pictures on that instagram. You would have to be blind not to see it.
---
Fortunately there are many oppurtunities to line of sight them.
---
This is probably Asmon’s burner account.
---
I think you're absolutely correct that it's an issue of his level. He simply cannot hit the mobs as often, so in addition to just doing less damage outright, he's missing white hits so that's less rage to spend on sunders and revenges. Really, that other warrior  should have been 'the tank' if he's higher level. 
---
And yeah that guy needs to un-bunch his panties. He's fine.
---
I guess I forgot: always open with a demo roar. it generates enough initial threat that your healer shouldn't be able to pull threat. then begin the swipe rotation.
---
wrt mages: you can't hold threat against them when they don't play smart, don't bother. they have enough cc that you just need to make sure that whatever they pull doesn't get to the healer. when the mobs are Nova'd, just leave them be.
---
you shouldn't be trying to offtank in dungeons unless the tank goes down. and if that does happen, utilize your brez and innervate the healer directly after
---
As I said in my edit and in half my comments in this thread, I thought it was for only wow classic. Why are you being a jerk? You should really be a nicer person.
---
Nowhere did I say that I thought I should pay a different price from anyone. You're just a mean person.
---
Ring is unique
---
What?
---
Yep whole reason why I picked lock in the first place back in classic. The mount was warlock only and looked badass.
---
1. The guy had offered shit advice all dungeon, so no, I didn't want to read what they had to say. I don't think it was shitty of him to say no. What I should have said in response to that was, "Do you want some dps advice? STOP AOEING EVERY PULL IF YOU DON'T WANT AGGRO." Oh wait...I asked him to stop doing that a billion times already. His idea of advice was tab sundering and using challenging shout, which like... You can't spam a 10min cooldown. Obviously. And sundering is important but you can't ONLY do that.
---
2. You can't spam demo because the spam doesn't hold nearly the kind of threat you need anymore, but I agree you should use it for the debuff. I heard Battle Shout was better but it depends on how many people are in the immediate area/get buffed with it (i.e., it does better if there are more melee/more pets in the group). He used both every pull at least once. Not sure if he used cleave, I didn't check.
---
3. Pugging has gotten worse and worse, but we raced to 40 and then slacked off, so we're smack in the middle of the nonsense, now, and it's all very hit or miss. Our ZF group was perfectly lovely; this one was a wild contrast.
---
4. Tank or I marked every pack, and it didn't help at all. I agree sometimes AoE is a better idea, but my blizzard runs me out of mana fast and then I'm completely useless. NOTHING was dying even remotely fast enough for me to not stand around looking stupid for a long time, so I tried not to Blizzard until primary target was at least almost dead.
---
5. Tank wasn't uppity about threat; the DPS pulling threat was uppity about having it, and so was the priest (even though I nova'd to save all of them multiple times and they didn't just stand back and get a heal/save themselves). 
---
6. I'm not gonna downvote you. You're entitled to your opinions and experiences and I wanted to see every perspective this sub could offer, or I wouldn't have asked. I appreciate that you took the time to type this up. We had other bad runs, too, so it's not like one rocky road ruined everything, but the previous runs were issues due to bad players or being underleveled and not due to aggro issues. He's read tons of guides and has been following them; he is willing to learn! But he's not going to listen to someone who has proven they're a jackass from the very beginning (the arms warrior) and whose idea of advice is to tell him to do eXACTLY what he was ALREADY doing (using sunders and taunts). Like you can taunt if you want to, but it doesn't ensure threat forever, and you can't spam them; they have cooldowns.
---
He's not that bad, but is annoying at times.  Naturally people get super upset about dumb shit so you'll hear dramatic opinions about it.
---
I won’t disagree that it works as dps talent, but it does have tanking use when you have not reached uncrittable.  When you get crit, your healer has to drop more heals, having that extra threat from multiple swings and multiple SoR procs helps to maintain threat during the healers spike.  
---
Truth is, as a former vanilla endgame paladin tank, I didn’t get to tank anything serious.  A few bosses, but mostly trash from MC to AQ40, and only trash in Naxx.  I just want to tank, I don’t really care if it’s rag, or some core hounds.   I don’t have useful uncrittable armour (ie no intellect, mp5, spell damage), so I will continue to use reckoning for some time.  
---
My spec is 24/27/0 and hope reckoning can maintain some damage for solo while I can tank or heal dungeons and raid heal until I’ve got Pre-BiS tank gear.
---
yup. i had brothers (or roommates, i forget) in my guild who took shifts on their way to rank 14. played something like 20 hours a day between the 2.
---
Seriously?  Has no-one else but me noticed that he spelt again, "AGIAN" not once, but twice?
---
Bring it, blue boy.
---
Mages are retards
---
No, this also happened when we killed Thrall on 5 different layers.
---
Bloke012 has it right. Help others get attuned and BiS. It builds a sense of community with guildmates and can be fun. Also if people see you online and helping others rather than just waiting for raids, it does wonders for your rep and loot rules aside, will often work in your favor when it come down to distribution.
---
To be fair, I neither like nor hate asmon (never seen his twitch and I play on a different server) but your initial 'question' was worded in a way that implied he was a failure who can't succeed at raiding cities (when, based on a few comments up, the reality is that he was too good at raiding servers AND eliciting a proper response from the horde that it broke the server.) With that implication in mind, what sort of response did you expect? You likely would have received a similar response even if it wasn't surrounding such a controversial streamer.
---

I think he had at least one basic ish video that I've seen, but I'm pretty sure it was for a bear tank (?). I didn't care that much for his videos but I honestly can't remember what about them bothered me. Maybe I should try again.

Would be better if u sac vw and cast group fear and run away lol
---
I'm a customer now, I'm allowed to demand a functional product that I am paying for.
---
Dungeon grind for your pre-bis, including the dungeon quests. Some of the quest rewards from 58-60 give solid items that you can use, or at least vendor for a good amount.
---
Additionally, typing =/= "crying". If that's your internal voice, that's on you.
---
blatant bullshit? are u kidding me lol? go look hes classic lvling video he didnt shower or change clothes from lvl 49 until they cleared the raids.. go look hes video from 2016 explaining why he had to get hes teeth done... go look the video of him showing of hes room!.. go look hes video of him doing arenas and popping cds on a player with thorns on and wonder why he dies ending in the team mates having to shout that thorns is up.. he is not even interupting and he is supposed to be multi glad rofl... go on warcraft logs and watch hes logs from raids.. i dont need to prove anything its all there right infront of u go look it up yourself lol
---
I think there is on some stuff, but I figured that was iconic enough that sound was unnecessary.

yea /r/classicwow

Classic advice my guy. Sometimes it's good to see it reiterated. :) Also, happy cake day!

# 3 60 NO SCOPE (no hunter)
---
It's also a possibility that OP found it easier to take a pic on his phone and post it because he uses reddit on his phone and not his computer? 
---
So passive aggressively telling someone of the existence of a print screen button seems petty to me.
---
But you can assume he meant to educate. 
---
And I'll assume he was being a dickhead.
---
And we can both go our own way.
---
They only said that they are adding a new tag to the server, which is layered.  They didn't say they are changing the way that they are labeling the indicator for realm population.  You are the one that needs to provide evidence, not anyone else since you're making the claim that they are changing the way realm population indicators work.  I don't really have anything else for you, and you're making this too complicated.  
---
**Layering has had nothing to do with total realm population cap, or the indicators for it.**  Not sure where you are getting this from.
---
**Layering has nothing to do with the total number of people that could fit on a realm in vanilla.**  It was just to break up the population at the start.
---
F

I have alts across 4 servers, just on my main account. I already have 4 characters past 20 in classic and I haven't even really decided who I'm going to main yet. The biggest draw for me is how well the professions feed into each other, or rather how just about every other profession feeds enchanting lol
---
read the thread mate. It requires a certain amt of players. I can upload some VoDs of us destroying org with similar lag spikes if you want..
---
&gt; When the overzealous tank pulls while I'm OOM I can sit and drink because I have backup. It's nice.
---
I tanked a dungeon as a bear with another druid DPS'ing cat, mage decided to body pull 4-5 mobs and couldn't keep aggro on all of them and healer ate it. Not only did dude not at least shift into bear when the pull went bad to Growl the mobs off the healer, when the healer ate it, he didn't heal me (even though I finally got ahold of everything) even thought I was typing "Other druid heal me!" in chat.
---
Asked him afterwards and he said "I'm a feral druid, I don't use spells." I swear I wanted to tear his head off. There's a lot of really bad druid players that don't realize that a druid's *only* strength is flexibility.
---
rest bonus seems like a joke anyway
---
went to bed last night in an inn.  woke up and I had like 1.5 bars worth of bonus.  like is the game expecting me to leave for a week?  maybe it's more significant at higher levels, idk
---
I fucking love rogues
---
I'm not offended, I'm confused and legitimately asking why people find this kind of entertainment enjoyable.
---
I agree with your stated position in comments and clarifications. I would not agree with your title itself. 
---
If someone turns loot to master loot for a reserved item boss and the reserved item was disclosed ahead of time, I see no issue with it. I won’t join a reserved item run unless I am ok with the item being reserved. And I won’t join a reserved item run unless the group is already mostly formed (a guild group with 1 pug or maybe 2 pugs if ubrs). 
---
If someone puts the whole instance on master loot, they better let me know ahead of time. This is fine for raids with some pugs. But for ubrs I would be suspicious. And I would want to know the loot rules in detail (who can roll on what) in advance. Too much work for a pug ubrs, so I probably would not join. 
---
If someone changes a run to master looter mid run, I am out unless they fix it. It should be disclosed at the time of advertising. Or at the very latest concurrently with the invitation to the group. Letting me know once I am at the dungeon before the first pack is way too late. Pull this shit, and I won’t group with you in the future (not happened to me yet in Classic, but did in Vanilla).
---
Honestly I don’t care for asmon but these posts are so lame. Gotta attach his name to everything for clout scraps

Is ravager needed to meleecleave? like do all 4 warriors need to have ravager?
---
That's what I said... I wish I'd have told the arms warrior that if tanking was so easy, he should tank.
---
You still drop about 18g short even with auctioning stuff instead of vendoring
---
Unaware cringy irony.
---
I'm already geared and prepared, there was plenty of time. I got my full preraid bis and I'm raidlogging for MC/Ony now and if I don't raid I'm chilling next to Prince Nazjak spawn.
---
I don't use it much myself. Maybe if you are tanking 5+ mobs to slow their attacks but it isn't the best use of rage.
---
Also don't use Heroic Strike. That is pretty much only useful in raids when you have a ton of extra rage.
---
We only do dungeons for the quests (for now). I like the idea of a shield spike, though. That could be useful. :D
---
I'd rather be a zoomer than some boomer with a dumb name. And just so we're clear your excuse for being bad is that you're a selfish bad raider?

It’s BIS for Hell Bovine spec

Never saw reservations in Vanilla. Classic is a weird animal...

This sounds like something for guild groups.

What happens if you hit it’s still casting?
---
Ooof don't bring up TClap, I'm still salty that it's a Battle Stance only ability.  If anything, it should be Def Stance only.

No idea what Blizzard's thinking was on that one

We will not allow weakness!

Out...  side?  Is this on kalimdor or ek?
---
The fundamentals of tanking are the same regardless of content, gear, talents, ect. I'm sorry you are too dense to understand this. Maybe the OP's friend isn't and can glean more from the videos than you were able. Disagree as you will, I'm done engaging with you. The OP can decide for himself if the videos are appropriate.
---
Sometimes I just want a cold slice of pizza though.
---
That’s totally fair. I expected him to, like, be a ninja looter or super toxic or something.
---
Dual wield is better for leveling IMO, one miss as two hand with a slow weapon and you feel it hard.
---
Level an alt, farm mats for raid. Help other guildies etc.

It's actually pretty annoying that it's on three different classes BiS lists.

I saw a video where he kicked this guy out of his guild for calling people the n word and retards etc. This guy started getting whispers calling him out for being the piece of shit he is and he goes all rage mode on asmon like “you’re responsible for you’re users! You’re toxic asmon! You ruined the game! Haha carried!” That’s how I picture all the anti asmon posters in this sub. You’re way more toxic than you claim he is. Stay angry. I bet that fuckface started some sort of anti asmongold thread for sure.
---
I'm not gonna name and shame 'cause even though it's a negative experience (and one I could share on the realm subreddit), I'd rather just put the guy on ignore for now. His crime wasn't bad enough to be shamed publicly imo.
---
I have had enough shitty groups with ret pally healers that I make them turn on divine favor or kick after saying they can heal

Trolling other people's post history to try and make them feel bad about themselves? Yeah, you look PRETTY AWFUL right now.

Edit: LMFAO this dude brags about driving a subaru forester rofl
---
Totally agree with your sentiment, but to pretend you can never be disappointed in a game you like is bullshit lol. I enjoy the game 95% of the time just cause I have a bad experience doesn't mean I'm abandoning the game as a whole and that I didn't have fun the other 8 days of playtime I have lol. It was just an experience that I wanted to share to see how others may have reacted. I've always played multi spec classes so I always wait and ask before I need or run it by people when we start the instance. I'm less concerned with the gold and more concerned with just playing with people who are courteous; espexially when you're in a dungeon with 10+ bosses and it takes a long time. And then when they responded in the fashion that they did I was more apologetic than angry thinking that I was in fact the one being a jerk. Everyone else on the thread seems to think so as well ... But genuinely I'm a very nice and courteous player and always try to uplift the people I'm with. It's been a long while since I've had a negative experience like this one but seeing the community react makes me think it's less uncommon than I previously thought.

There are tons of big twitch streamers who debatably dont fit one of those things so i think you have your metrics wrong. Attractiveness has never really seemed that important for male streamers.

My question is why do people universally accept prioritizing crit &gt; hit after 9%, but preraid BiS lists contradict that?

I went BS to make my own gear and eventually gear for guildies. Close to phase 2 I'll have a gathering alt to grab herbs and ore to supplement my alchemy on my druid and blacksmith on my warrior. Then I'll grind out engineering on both for that sweet pvp items.

 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit) 
---
&gt;Calculating Miss Rate for Physical Damage Attacks  
---
&gt;Hit chance decreases chance to miss rather than increases chance to hit. Chance to miss in PvE is determined solely by the difference in the defending mob's Defense Skill and the player's Weapon Skill. Further, the effect is not linear. So, there are actually two different formulas that might apply, depending upon whether the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10 or not. Here are the two formulas:  
---
&gt;If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill (level \* 5) and your Weapon Skill (\[level \* 5\] + additional bonuses) is less than or equal to 10 then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is:  
---
&gt;5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)\*.1%  
---
&gt;dual-wielding: 24% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)\*.1%  
---
&gt;If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is:  
---
&gt;7% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10)\*.4%  
---
&gt;dual-wielding: 26% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10)\*.4%  
---
&gt;Applying these formulas gives the following base miss rate for a Level 60 character with a 300 Weapon Skill:  
---
&gt;  \* v. Level 60 mob: 5.0% / dual-wield: 24%    \* v. Level 61 mob: 5.5% / dual-wield: 24.5%    \* v. Level 62 mob: 6.0% / dual-wield: 25%    \* v. Level 63 mob: 9.0% / dual-wield: 28%   
---
&gt;Thus if you are a Level 60 character with a Weapon Skill of 300, you need +9% chance to hit to never miss a shot against a Level 63 boss (or skull mob).  
---
&gt;What this means is that there is a big +hit benefit to keeping your Weapon Skill as high as possible for your class/race. For example, by improving your Weapon Skill from 290 to 295, you effectively reduce your chance to miss against Level 61 mobs by 3%! However, after getting to 295, increasing your Weapon Skill the next 5 levels, to 300, only reduces your chance to miss by an additional .5% (or 3.5% in total). Also, note that there is a huge jump in miss rate reduction by going from 294 to 295 Weapon Skill. This is the point where you switch from one formula to the other, and so this particular single point of Weapon Skill is worth a dramatic +1.4% hit against a Level 61 mob.  
---
&gt;Racial bonuses provided +Weapon Skill, and thus turned out to be pretty valuable for improving your +hit capability. For Humans, Dwarves, Orcs and Trolls their racial bonuses increased their Weapon Skill at Level 60 from 300 to 305. With a 305 Weapon Skill, your base miss rate against a Level 63 mob (or skull boss) was only 6% instead of 9%.  
---
&gt;Melee attacks divide in to two categories: auto attacks (white) and special attacks (yellow). Auto attacks use a one roll table and special attacks use a two roll table. Base chance to miss is the same for both auto attacks and special attacks. Attacking a mob from behind removes parry and block from both tables, provided the attack is more than 0.5 yards  
---
&gt;Auto attacks (one roll table)  
---
&gt;Each melee auto attack made by characters against mobs will result in one of the following in order of precedence:  
---
&gt;ResultMissDodgeParryGlancing blowBlockCritical strikeHit  
---
&gt;Increased hit chance can result in increased critical strike results from auto attacks. For example: maximum dual wielding weapon skill, 0% chance to hit, and chance to critical strike 50%. Dual wield auto attacking a raid boss from behind results in a loss of 8.6% critical strike:  
---
&gt;ResultChanceMiss28%Dodge5.6%Glancing blow25%Critical strike41.4%Hit0%  
---
&gt;Increase chance to hit to 10% and decrease chance to critical strike to 45% results in no loss of critical strike:  
---
&gt;ResultChanceMiss18%Dodge5.6%Glancing blow25%Critical strike45%Hit6.4%  
---
&gt;Special attacks (two roll table)  
---
&gt;Each melee special attack made by characters against mobs will result in one of the following in order of precedence:  
---
&gt;ResultMissDodgeParryBlockHit  
---
&gt;If the result is block or hit, then a second roll occurs to determine critical strike as follows:  
---
&gt;Block: roll for blocked hit or blocked critical strike  
---
&gt;Hit: roll for hit or critical strike  
---
&gt;Increased hit chance can result in increased critical strike results from special attacks upon exceeding the base 9% chance to miss. For example: maximum weapon skill (300 at level 60), chance to hit 0% and chance to critical strike 25%. Special attacking a raid boss (level 63 and 315 defense) from behind results 21.35% critical strike (25% of 85.4%). Increase chance to hit to 10% results in 23.6% critical strike (25% of 94.4%).  
---
&gt;Note: It is possible and even likely that even yellow attacks use a one roll table, as the white attacks explain above.

Nice "source".
---
My question is why do people universally accept prioritizing crit &gt; hit after 9%, but preraid BiS lists contradict that?    
---
I understand how hit works, but nowhere on that wiki do they detail the value of hit beyond 9% compared to crit.
---
People like you are the explanation for all those players complaining they reached 60 and now "can't find anyone to raid with". I've found that really hard to understand; why did they not make a whole bunch of friends on their journey of 1-&gt;60? Apparently because they ditch everyone any time they have a gather quest, and don't make friends.
---
When you are running threw the path to goto wetlands you hook a left as your going out. It’s a tunnel/mine where you can farm incencidous ore, which is for a quest for mining. Just did it yesterday
---
9% is a soft cap. My guess is the idea to going past this is that your chance to hit continues to improve on level 62 mobs (bosses) and that will in turn result in more damage. Purely speculation but the only thing I can think is that hit % also effects number of attacks dodged and parried as well as missed. 9% gets nearly 100% of the time with no misses, but high level mobs still can dodge or parry which means anything beyond 9% would decrease dodges and parry from bosses resulting in higher damage output overall. 
---
A dodge is a lost attack which resulted in a sum of zero. For a rogue while DWing any lost damage will result in a lot lower dps because their damage is fast and low rather than slow and high.
---
&gt; Everyone knows: if you want to DPS as a Priest you need to spec Shadow, right? 
---
I Shadow for fun in PvP.
---
Put questie on there. No way she's wanting to read those quests

Congrats on rushing 60!

DPS warrior was one level lower (and Princess was orange to him). But I think he might have had better gear, so it's possible that would have made a difference.

I’d transfer to this realm if I could, just to troll this buttmunch.
---
Bro you’re replying back to a lot of comments about a pointless topic because you don’t want to pay a sub for a boss game. Sounds like you want attention
---
pservers had 14 000 concurrent players at times with fights like these goin down on the daily. You sir, don't know what the hell you are talking about.
---
Shouldn't this be bigger?
---
You know, that's very true.
---
You could transfer to Windseeker and give me a bunch of free stuff.
---
I mean, if somebody asked me to come up with reasons to defend why I enjoy listening to music, or watching my favorite shows on Netflix, I could very easily come up with a long list of reasons why those things are enjoyable to me. Can people who enjoy watching streamers not do the same to enlighten me?
---
They can heal fine even without holy spec even through scarlet monastery though. Source: level 42 paladin who heals often and is ret spec. Quit being elitist lol
---
This happens with all dps but mages. My buddy is a rogue and I’m a feral and it’s the exact same for him. There’s just a ton of people who want to dps vs heal or tank
---
&gt;Be on the lookout for another change that we will make in the coming days: soon, realms that are operating with more than one layer will indicate that on the realm selection screen. Those realms will say “Layered” in the realm list. Thereafter, you’ll only see the Full/High/Medium/Low markers for realms that are permanently set to one layer.
---
From the blue post that you provided to me. They are clearly stating it here. I'm trying to explain to you the logic behind why "layered" realms will only display "layered".
---
&gt;Thereafter, you’ll only see the Full/High/Medium/Low markers for realms that are permanently set to one layer.
---
That is the important distinction which clues us into the point. That is when they are removing the layer multiple from the population indicator, and it will break the function output. You will only see layered on realms with layering

I honestly don't know. I think you'll want something with good damage for your level. If your not keeping up with Engi Tclap is probably better.

and yep has the post history of a 13 year old.  Good job on being a living trope
---
Pretty sure you need a fully empty inbox for the icon, it was in a Loading Screen tip haha
---
I understand hit, however it is universally accepted crit &gt; hit post 9%, yet preraid BiS lists contradict that. Crit improves dps as does hit; and hit's value is lowered once the yellow cap is reached.
---
Nah though I would adopt some policy if I had things my way... Can't wish yourself a bigger dick ya know! Thanks for continuing to show yourself as a bigot though.
---
I think you are on to something for sure, and this is probably multifaceted. The easy solution is obv to throw more money on the hardware side of things, but there might also be conflicting code that is remnant from legion client at the base that is causing interference.
---
I must have missed the part about the guy giving advice being a jackass. I agree to not accept the advice. He was prolly just being condescending any how. 
---
Maybe just have your friend take a break from tanking for a bit. Maybe if he saw the dungeon from the other side the added perspective would help!
---
If I added a fourth, it would be natural funniness/spectacle. Like a fat guy that isn't good at videogames and isn't clever, but people watch him because he's like a train wreck. Like greek.

Men definitely tend to fall into either the skill or wit categories though. Some get by on their attractiveness but that mostly tends to be the category women fall back on.

100% on the druid bit; he was actually the only person that was nice to me and communicating. I'm generally a goofball and I like to have fun with the people I run with (dance, make jokes, etc..) I was more just hung up on the guys comment about needing (which kind of threw me off to start cause he kind of stated it in a tone of distrust) and the fact that he said that and then not one person communicated before needing stuff they weren't equipping.
---
It gives you an item used to douse runes in MC. You need to douse 8 in order to summon majordomo and then rag
---
This actually looks decent. As a mage I really would prefer this. Especially since scholo and strat drop so many essences of undeath
---
So a bunch of idiots destroy a bunch of idiots?
---
But the riding skill isn't.   So there's really no point in buying a mount this way, unless you just want to save yourself the walk to the vendor.
---
Same problem I've been having. Can't make any gold like this.
---
Seeing all these posts about purples dropping and selling for a few hundred gold is depressing.
---
You rushed all the content...so now you wait for everyone else to catch up. Maybe watch Twitch?

You get the better robe though :(

AV won't be a problem, but it won't last more than 10 minutes since they are releasing the super nerfed version of AV.

check the highest rated comment in this thread and you can let me know if you think i am too dense to understand which aspects of tanking apply to both raids and 5 mans. Personally, I think I understand it pretty well, and I also understand that nothing in skarmtank's videos speaks to those skills. He doesn't talk about the fundamentals of tanking 5 mans, as I did. It's not a criticism of him, it's simply not a subject he covers. The situation in a raid (especially in a top end raid full of optimized characters using consumables and world buffs, as is the case with skarm's videos' perspectives) is totally different from the situation in a 5 man and indeed, not very many things carry over! You're not going to be 
---
You can't link any examples to support your case, all you can do it foible and say "it it it, it carries over though!!1" 
---
There's nothing at stake here. You can just be honest with yourself and everyone here and say "yeah you're right, skarm's videos are more geared toward high end raid environments."
---
Same and I'm not really rushing. I'm having fun just leveling skills, doing instances here and there, and questing. My job takes priority.
---
I don't know anything about that, I just remember a stream where a bearded European guy kept accurately guessing his rolls, he was obviously being funny about it. I think it was him.
---
Spotted the American

I would hardly call 1 month rushing
---
Finally, somebody who has come up with an actual stated reason for why they watch streams. I commend you sir for not assuming I was offended like the other responses to my comment.
---
That said, that sounds god awful to me. I don't want somebody's random conversation about what's happening in their gameplay in my ear while I'm trying to concentrate on my own shit. If I want background noise I put on music, or It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
---
You're paying $15/month. Don't act as if you're some upper level executive demanding changes. You are a normal gamer. You can offer suggestions on server performance because x, y, z but DEMANDING change because you pay 15 dollar is laughable man. You need to seriously take a step back and reflect on what you're saying.
---
You've got the gamer elitism that runs rampant on the internet, its crazy. I hate using the term get a life but based off your profile, gaming is your life so maybe it makes sense that you feel entitled because you are a gamer. The logic is astounding.
---
Thank you for your perspective! Is Shield Slam prot only? Or just a move that requires a shield? 
---
He was using revenge quite often IIRC, but I'm not sure about Shield Slam. :D
---
MC pugs definitely happen regularly and clear it fine. Ony pugs seem to be more rare. Likely because there aren't enough people that have gone through the pain to get attuned that aren't running it with their guild.

He never once advocated for violence or police intervention. He said that people out there might resort to that path and you never know who you're dealing with.
---
Not really sure what sort of cabbage patch you grew up in, and I'll say that I've never been in a fist fight as an adult because I try very hard to avoid conflict, but I've definitely seen people get laid the fuck out and have their head cracked open, blood pooling on the pavement, for acting like a moron with someone they dont know. People get their ass beat for much less.
---
Alot of bad info in this video.
---
it depends how you play
---
...and that he's gonna taste great with a baked potato and some sauteed mushrooms.
---
I understand now. I would never prioritize crit over hit until i was like 13-15% personally, but I wasn’t the hugest theorycrafter (didn’t run dps sims until WoTLK back in the day, haven’t checked them out for classic either).
---
Fringe does not mean new.  Fringe means it was not mainstream.  It was fringe.  In 2004 gamers were still considered the anti-social geeks on the outside looking in.  Gaming took off in the early 2000's, and World of Warcraft was considered the leader by far in bringing new people into the industry.  This was not news back then, it was common knowledge.
---
not sure what you're on about, but as an older person I have a perspective you don't. I'd say the same thing to myself 20 years ago. Now get off my lawn.

Are you sure that part of the map is 'discovered' for you? Like does it show up the same as in the pic

---
I think back when WoW came out that wouldn't be called casual. But it is by today's standards
---
No.  You should probably get 1/3 shield block and last stand for raids if you want to tank them, but I had zero issue with what I did.

He is a ninja and fully expects his guild to ninja for the benefit of the guild. He's spent years raising toxicity because he's "a self made man"

Ah yes, the cancer zoom editing from the vanilla days. Wouldn't be a Classic PVP video without that junk.
---
&gt; What I have always thought of when I hear "zoomers' is the younger side of Generation Z as I thought it was attributed to kids who can't sit still due to the overstimulation of technology from a young age lol
---
It's not??? lol
---
i enjoyed it.  make more.
---
Who is chestnutz?
---
congrats!
---
The point is that I dont strip the emotional romantic idea, as it is one of many big pillars in the game. I dont play a character stats simulation, but you seem to. In your case without any "romantic emotions", you are very correct.
---
But thats just not the case for everyone and certainly not the original idea of the system. I think my perspective is as clear as yours and it boils down to the differences of playstyle. While I will always call it greed if it is translated down to money, you will need on everything that is somehow progress if you are allowed to.
---
Keep in mind that I always used you and me as substitutes for people and rest assured that I don't think u/Dorfingarlou is a ninja looter.
---
The actual issue we have are the people that fall for greed and roll need without consent. You could say those who roll greed are making the mistake, but with the difference that they don't hurt anyone by their playstyle.
---
If it goes well we might find another spot. Lol. But normally I only have 2-3 hours tops after the kids go to bed anyway.
---
How much damage does a 2H DPS warrior compared to a DW one? Are they useful on raids?
---
Imagine being so attached to a streamer's dick that you think THAT constitutes shittalking.
---
&gt;Btw I'm not angry
---
You sure are. Don't worry. I'm sure your mancrush appreciates the esupport.
---
That's what I was worried about! I was curious to know what he would have said, but after his other advice, I just couldn't be bothered to let him think I thought anything he'd say was valuable.
---
Thanks, though. I agree that he should probably take a little break and maybe dps a few dungeons before he tries tanking again. It might be a little too chaotic with randoms to always be enjoyable for him.
---
go back to retail mate, instead of bombing my thread with your shit. I am obviously entitled to demand whatever the hell I want. I'm not entitled to those demands being met, naturally. 
---
You know all those private servers that shut down once classic launched in order to support Blizzards initiative? They are all considering starting back up. Not to make money, but because what Blizz has delivered is shit, and isn't really worth paying for. 
---
The amt of money paid doesn't matter. My posisition doens't matter. I'm a customer, ofc I have the option of voicing my concerns. 
---
The fact that I'm even doing so is me saying that I would rather support official classic servers, but that there's a limit to it. 
---
They don't have to listen, but based on the upvote rate here I am probably not the only one. 
---
So my only advice to you is that you should be carefull not to trip and fall on your face when you decend from your high horse.
---
So questing / leveling / farming will be impossible basically as casual in the evenings or on weekends... way to many players as it is already :(

You can layer hop 1 quadrillion times into 2 total layers. My original comment stands. You have no proof beyond your fears and feelings.

You literally could have wanded yet you decided to cast something?

I started using this ONLY for KoS and I have a character notes addon for keeping track of alliance members that are shitty or kind. I was wondering if there is an anti KoS list like horde that you like. I helped a horde get his WW axe after his friend died. Literally charged and mocking blowed when the horde was at 15% and he managed to bandage and kill it. I'd like to keep track of the opposite faction that I've had good encounters with. I think Vanas KoS might have it but didn't know if spy did

Facts. I'll do the same....if the price is right because I'm broke as well xD
---
My wife is the opposite. She is sure to read every single line of text she encounters.
---
its a classic what can I say?
---
Yes, dude, it was fringe by any measure compared to today.  World of Warcraft brought in millions and millions of people into gaming who had not played video games before.   As I said below, gamers were the anti-social geeks on the outside looking in.  Today, they are mainstream, accepted and the better players are looked up to socially.

It doesn't mean gaming was new (I had Atari myself in the early 80's), but it does call into perspective where the industry was at.  The gaming industry relaly took off in the early 2000's.  Those were the breakout years.
---
Hey a couple pillows then and make it cozy :-)
---
As for race/class, I’m going to let her make the decisions. And I’ll pick mine accordingly. Was thinking DPS might be easier. In that case I’m hoping to play shaman.
---
His 2 largest viewers bases are 25-35, and 35-45. People just like asshole personas this isn’t a new thing.
---
There's a regular wind rider master in Moonglade as well. You knew that, right? :p
---
If you are talking about raiding single target DPS then you just spam frost bolt.
---
Frostbite doesn't exist in classic and bosses are immune to frost nova so you can't shatter.
---
They feed off each others trashiness.
---
No it is not that easy to find groups. Depending on what time of day you might be a while. If it's around the afternoon you will have an easier time.
---
*edit* 
---
Just saw you were talking about raids and not 5 man dungeons. I was referring to dungeons. Raid is going to take even longer to find.
---
It depends what you want to do in this game though, If you don't mind leveling and exploring the world /played is a good metric of how much value you're getting out of your 15 dollars a month.
---
An example is if you're level 30, I imagine you've got roughly 2-4 days /played which is anywhere from 48 hours to 96 hours of time played. Meaning in the time you've spent playing WoW for a single month you got as much time towards playing a Borderlands game.
---
I'm not saying you made a mistake buying BL3, I'm saying that simply complaining about the cost per month just because its an old game is meaningless since its the most actively played MMO regardless of age it's still relevant.
---
Very cool! I hope she likes it. 🙂
---
&gt; You have no proof beyond your fears and feelings.
---
lmao what is this even supposed to mean?
---
Simply a reminder. Lol.
---
Ohhh okay. That sucks. I will continue to avoid any of his videos if that’s how it is.
---
There is no value, that's the point.   If a 9% hit cap means a 100% chance not to miss on a level 63 or skull level,  then stacking anything over that is severely diminishing when it could be spent on +crit etc.   The reason being, is that you won't come up against anything over level 63.    Because people are investing in a redundant stat past 9%, they are wasting DPS.
---
&gt; There's a regular wind rider master in Moonglade as well. You knew that, right? :p
---
Yeah, but he's farther away and charges me money.
---
Horde gay
---
Here I am. Been playing since 04 and I am level 32. Good work!!
---
Lol ok, so because he can bullshit and act serious sometimes, I’m suppose to believe that because......? If anything, the majority of time he’s on screen, he’s a douche but you’re right! THAT’S the act! 
---
The rest of your post is just random bullshit where you tried to be cute and didn’t actually answer anything. Good job though! 👍
---
Yep! This is how I plan to go about it.
---
If you get the 20 sec timer while logging out, you're not in a rest area
---
Your HS goes on cooldown. Nothing else.
---
Counter point, I tried to set my wife up with my keybinds and she absolutely hated them. She honestly has no idea how I play with them. I showed her how to set them up on her own and she's slowly built something that works for her.
---
I mean luckily vanilla classes are pretty simple so other than some additional cooldowns you largely know what you're getting yourself into.  I think the only classes with real nuances to their playstyles are Warriors (for their stance dancing) and Druids (for their shifting)
---
As long as you test out different playstyles EG DoTs vs straight up spell casting, 10-20 is enough to feel out the class
---
Got really lucky dropping that tremor totem RIGHT before he feared. He didn't have a chance to react to it and dagger it down first.
---
Im more interested in why you havent got consec as its a really good damaging tool even as ret.
---
I mean sure, maybe they didn't want to quest. But does that necessarily mean they didn't enjoy the trip from 1 to 60? Sure they rushed, but they still earned 60. I'm sure those people are still very proud of what they did, and makes doing anything on *their* level 60 much more entertaining.
---
I leveled engineering and got the [Gnomish Mind Control Cap](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10726/gnomish-mind-control-cap). Apparently you don't actually mind control people, it just makes them friendly to you and they follow you for 20 seconds. I saw on wowhead that you're supposed to get a pet action bar, but I'm not getting it. Am I alone in this? Maybe it's bugged for warlocks (even though I dismiss my pet first)?
---
Noted!  In my very limited experience, tanks are usually the ones with the most disappointment/annoyance with Shaman.  General chat discussion re totems wiping instance parties is what started my research today.  Didn't want to be "that guy" :-)
---
The damage is much higher than imp. Also the charm is a nice cc even in pve.
---
How do you bind things that arent on the keyboard 1-0?
---
&gt; Yeah he can be toxic, but a hell of a lot of gamers are toxic 
---
The "It's ok to be toxic because other people are toxic" defense. 
---
/eyeroll
---
More than happy to lend a hand. :P
---
nah you always need at least 5+ because your 2 main items that you always have up are your healthstone and soulstone. whenever you use that healthstone (and you might as well use it often so to save on bandages/potions) that's a shard you gotta replace. also your average dungeon requires you to reapply soulstone on the healer at least once.
---
Thanks for explaining. Didn't consider the difference between boe and bop, but that makes sense.
---
And yeah, I think people play wow with different objectives in mind, so communicating standard practice with group is always good.
---
Personally, I like idea of giving epics to needs in the group because it "means" more, has a better story. Trading out for gold at the auction house is just too sterile, in my book. But to each their own.
---
The potency of cancer that is Asmongold is countered only by the absolute cringe that is the narrator of this video.
---
The more the better. It's not really viable without at least a couple. Do arms from 36 and up until 40
---
Im looking into fury prot spec, dual wielding and switching to shield as needed, and Im trying to find out info on dual wielding.  The wikis I see show dual wielding adds a 19% hit penalty to both hands, which just sounds like it disqualifies dual wielding but I know people do it.  All the wikis are past classic tho, even the vanilla wiki talks about death knight talents.
---
So, comparing to just one handed specialization in the prot tree and no 19% hit penalty, are there some gear thresholds I have to meet to even get a dps increase from dual wielding?
---
weapon skill, hit cap, crit and impale talent in that order go a long way for threat, also prioritizing heroic strikes at 5 stacks of sunder provides a good boost while prioritizing revenge and shield slam on cooldown
---
You leave scary Melissa and scary Brandon out of this, bitch.
---
Also it's a trope created long before that shit, throwback to like the 30s as "the American dream" ... Bitch.
---
Yup. Reddit is a mage in my server.
---
But he takes you anywhere you wanna go instead of just to TB :p
---
Your voice is one of the worst things I've ever heard.
---
Booooooo this man!
---
this is scary
---
What?? Did your even read the quest text? Congratulations though.
---
My wife thought she'd try and learn sometime, but she completely could not understand the 3D movement/orientation.  She much preferred Mortal Kombat.
---
&gt; but your initial 'question' was worded in a way that implied he was a failure who can't succeed at raiding cities
---
I heard he failed at raiding one of the cities, but I don't follow him. Hence the question.
---
&gt; the reality is that he was too good at raiding servers
---
Yeaaaa... no. The server crashing doesn't make you good.
---
&gt; With that implication in mind, what sort of response did you expect?
---
This is like... the third interaction I've had with fans of streamers. Considering the vitriol I got from asking who he was a while back, I'm not at all surprised to see his sycophants at it again.
---
I mean MC doesn't go away when BWL comes out... This isn't retail you have to do the old content... Also it is only phase 2 its basically a 5 man and the honor system and world bosses (which casual guilds likely wouldn't get even if they were 60). No one is trying to rush casual players have fun and enjoy the game at your own pace there will always be guilds that are just starting progression though mc etc.
---
Took me about 5h farming the runes (52-53) and 4h farming essences of fire (lvl55-56). It was decent exp per hour wise though that was only possible because I did it on weekday mornings, would have probably taken longer otherwise with lots of people farming satyrs.
---
I farmed satyrs in azshara, it's really nice when you have one of the camps for yourself. Jadefire run in felwood is also nice but usually more crowded.
---
Fire came from un'goro, not as good exp wise because the mobs are so spread out but I could have made about 30g/h at level 55 if I had sold the essences. While farming 12 essences I also got 34 elemental fires which I sold. Nice.
---
I bought the essences of undeath for about 1g each and was missing 8 felcloth after farming the runes which I bought for 2.5g each.
---
Made the robe at level 57 btw. Highly recommend grinding these mobs while they still give exp if you intend to do it anyway.
---
Edit: On a pve server.
---
I shouldn't expect a moron to realize the burden of proof is on the person making the claim.
---
Apologies. I'll let you get back to your coloring books.
---
Enjoyed this because of the pure hilarity of the famous last words. Thank you.
---
Been playing with my wife. She's unmotivated to play without me... aaaand I'm now level 50 while she is in her mid 30s. I think she's not big on rushing. I play at semi fast casual. Not horribly behind few hours a night. Been questing with her even though it cuts her xp based on how much dmg I do to them...
---
9% is the yellow hit cap, rogue abilities.     
---
24.8% is the white hit cap, rogue basic attacks. The true absolute hit cap.    
---
My question is trying to figure out what the (diminished) value of hit beyond 9% is worth, compared to crit/agi, the only other relevant stats to replace it with.
---
Who cares.
---
I don't know why I spend my time talking to brainlets
---
Spell is a dire maul drop, can't get it until p2
---
I’m 7g short on my warrior and I’m contemplating selling gear
---
So currently, my guild has a good handful of prot tanks already and I oftentimes don't get to tank. But I want to tank. What's a good build where I can afford to tank when needed but still put out decent dps given this requirement?
---
Can I make notes of friendly players?
---
That's a name I have not heard in a long time
---
Good advice. I think I'm gonna just try to avoid those groups that don't trust each other.
---
Seriously, if someone tells me they could use it, I don't give a crap. Be my guest.
---
I use polymorph pig. Much more embarrassing
---
Nah, I’m just saying people get so worked up over him while they are rly not any better than him- and maybe I haven’t seen the right videos but the person I’ve seen him be most toxic to is Mcconnell! Which is just funny cause McConnell is such a douchebag, so I don’t rly see the problem.
---
Yeah, I didn't mention poison/disease in my post just because I usually handle those pretty quickly with individual casts... I did not realize the mana efficiency for the totem over the dispell cast was that extreme though. Thanks!
---
I always find it’s the best imagery, it’s so pleasurable blowing my wad to people selling items/mats way too cheap while I’m buying them all out. Just knowing I found that many good deals is such a massive turn on.
---
In other words, I don’t think you should regret blowing your wad to the AH, and people will have to experience it for themselves and see if the AH is what they like while masturbating.
---
Fair enough, to each their own playstyle, but my goal is to make it fair to everyone and avoid ninjas especially. This seems like a VERY controversial issue so I think im gonna take an habit of letting people know my intentions at the start of dungeons now to avoid drama. Sorry for the drama lol
---
Don't worry even if you are not raiding when BWL comes out guilds will still do MC as it still holds critical items for progression. You will not be missing out on content when they introduce new content.
---
Teebu’s Blazing Longsword is the item that everyone remembers from the box.
---
Do they ever plan on activating/fixing the meeting stones?
---
Teebu's Blazing Longsword was on the vanilla box
---
It’s more like:
---
“Hey were you hanging out with Stacy today?”
---
“No”
---
5 minutes later
---
“So you didn’t hang out with Stacy today, right?”
---
“NO”
---
I know it’s none of my business but a lot of your comments are really negative/borderline hateful at people. Yours towards my post was more rude than anything.
---
Sometimes I can be a dick online too but if you’re not okay or need to talk to someone just shoot me a msg.
---
Look at big brain over here
---
Ya but huntard
---
Frostbite is a tier 2 talent. Not sure what it was in Wrath, but it definitely exists in the current build.
---
There will also be people hunting those people. For servers with massive gaps in population i fear for
---
They didn't summon people until TBC so likely never.
---
Pfft that health bar is also my pew pew bar.
---
31/5/15 seems to be a solid all around build. You can dps as arms for solo content, but you'll be tanky enough with a sword and board when needed.
---
Set your goal and have fun
---
This is a primary concern for my wife. Hoping we can work through it!
---
I've never played retail hmmm.
---
Nah, I'm entitled to demand you stop demanding because I bought reddit gold once. So no.
---
Wait, you're saying I'M on a high horse hahahha. WE DEMAND IT. is literally in your video hahhaha. You're a joke man.
---
The lack of any sense of entitlement is lost on you. Gamers unite against BAD game company who dont listen to me...the EXPERT GAMER
---
Chill lol what’s so offensive about this post? I’m barely shitting on this sub, at most I’m asking people to consider why they hate this guy so much
---
That's disappointing... I mean it was their intended purpose
---
What your native language?  Maybe if can go both ways!!  Unfortunate that you’re alliance though!
---
You do?
---
And it also ruins the ability to hide from higher levels. I felt genuinely like A hobbit in the first LotR yesterday as I (gnome) crouched behind a tree stump to avoid the level?? orc rogue riding by
---
Warlock! I have a Paladin main too, a lock can do most of the things a hunter can do plus free mounts (atleast cheaper) soul shards are easier to manage than ammo imo and there is less competition for gear
---
Probably because of the chat.  I don't know if you've ever seen your average twitch chat but like... man I sure HOPE they're 11 years old.  Otherwise they're all in a lot of trouble as far as, you know, life.
---
Yeah DKP works really well in a guild where there's a low turnover of members. It sucks when someone saves up and gets the item they want and bails on the guild. That's why loot council is overall better with good officers.
---
My RL friend in vanilla, same guild as me, he went like massively negative in DKP when he got to BWL lol. He was the only druid who didn't have all the gear, so he was forcibly purchasing every druid item. Worked for him since he had no competition, but man that sucks really bad for anyone else who actually has to be smart with their buys.
---
Because if you don't stack, the surger will start charging randomly all over the raid, potentially causing the tank to lose aggro. That's far worse than the whole raid taking 1000 damage once or twice.
---
Noooooo.... I was planning on going home and playing wow all weekend. Don't make me go outside
---
I was on vanilla around the same time. I think it's something that developed over the years through retail. People stopped talking, stopped helping, everything was about stats and collecting.
---
I (unfortunately) ran with one of these groups the other day. It was as big surprise to me too. Their attitudes and approach purposefully made the game not fun. Every one of them was totally self-obsessed. I guess a-holes running with a-holes dont notice the stench.
---
Isn't Drain Life a thing?
---
That priest was horrible
---
Most people prefer to level in the Eastern Kingdoms and it isn't an efficient use of time to run all the way to BFD to run it.
---
Wand does like 50 damage vs mind blast 700. The shield was a mistake, though.
---
OP wants to get his way and feel better about their self, because they can't let shit go. Did you read the conversation? Guild leader says they are working on getting it to them through a ticket. OP immediately threatens them. GM says we're trying to help, don't threaten me. OP says I'm not threatening you, a blatant lie.
---
Really ends up looking sad for OP here. Imagine having that much rage and cognitive dissonance over an item and a misunderstanding in Classic WoW.
---
There was no ninja looting here. Why would somebody ruin their own reputation on purpose? This was obviously a misunderstanding. It sucks. Forgive and forget, OP, before you give yourself a heart attack.
---
I’m not arguing anything it’s pretty clear you do.
---
I have other characters I’ll play. Then our toons will be on the exact same quests and exp. And I’m gonna recommend that when I’m not on she makes an alt.
---
Best thing I’ve watched in a long time haha
---
It's at least one guild per server, some servers have 3 or 4 there, and it's only going to increase now that the average level is hitting mid 40s.
---
Just because there is no honor system doesn't mean  you can't pvp.
---
Challenging yourself in pvp especially against multiple opponents is very rewarding.
---
Can also level engineering and craft all trinkets, reflectors etc. in preparation of the honor patch.
---
Lol that isn't for Classic. Christ you are dumb.
---
Pretty sure he’s meaning to sound like that.
---
I can absolutely confirm there isn't a pushback cap. Ran UBRS as a resto sham and (using Quartz as reference) I took 12+ seconds to cast a chain heal because 5-6 whelps were all beating on me and I'm not specced for pushback reduction.
---
Nope. I sent enchanted gear to my alts
---
100% this. It took me a while to see that I was dragging my SO along instead of playing the game with her. She didn't have the opportunity to explore the game and fall in love with the world when I was dictating where we go, how she spends her talents, and what quests we are doing. Once I realized that I was not allowing her to experience the game I stopped doing that stuff and only helped her when she asked. Everything was so much better after that.
---
Explain mechanics, not meta.
---
That's not true, honored is the max reputation discount at 10%.
---
How can you even consider playing the best game ever created on a laptop ?
---
RiP in peace, brother. May the beauty of the plains and hills of Mulgore allow you an easy rest.
---
When questing gets the best of you
---
Wow you sure sound confident even though you’re talking out of your ass.
---
I've never watched this steamer and even I could tell it was a passive aggressive attempt at shit talking at best.
---
I give the kisses, but I also give the resurrections!(;
---
Does consecration damage ticks proc Seal of Wisdom's judgement effect?
---
happens even without addons. U have mail, and then it dissapears. And again.
---
Never had that problem mate
---
Better start training that right foot.
---
I guess I was thinking it was one of the new spells Frost mages have on retail.  But in any case bosses are going to be immune to it as well.
---
It's hard to argue against that concept because a stone just sitting there isn't very useful, but they didn't implement them until bc  /shrug
---
Sorry, just to clear up one aspect of the post - I didn't claim him aggregating a bunch of people made him personally skilled at the game. I meant to word it in a way that was more like "anyone who can get enough people on both factions together in wPvP that it crashes the servers is good at generating wPvP in-game." Obviously that's not relevant to his personal skill at the game, but it does make him "good at raiding cities" - and is certainly the opposite of 'failing at raiding cities' which would be defined as being unable to gather enough people to successfully raid a city, IMO - since personal skill would hardly play a factor in the success of that raid.
---
Again, my main point was the wording of your initial post was worded in a way that implies you're part of the hate-train I see against him everyday on this sub (which btw, as a non-viewer is honestly more annoying than the pro-streamer stuff that gets posted, due to how often posts hating on him come up). With that in mind, it's clear to see why fans of his would respond in the way that poster did. I would say your initial post started the vitriol, even though the response you received did take it to a much further degree. Though I recognize it was just confusion - you repeated what you had heard, no one can blame you for that.
---
U forgot the devilsaur
---
Set do not disturb
---
I really believe that people here only get worked up over him because they're tired of people posting videos about him every time he scratches his ass. A few weeks ago I was scrolling through, and it was something like 10 out of 20 posts - "Asmongold ninjas something!" "Asmongold completes a dungeon!" "Asmongold sneezes!"
---
It's ridiculous.
---
How dare you assume their genders in this day and age!
---
^(fuck the internet for making me have to say /s somewhere in this, though)
---
Ty for this post. It's been on my mind that I'm worried about healing dungeons end-game but also being able to solo-farm content as well. I'll be giving this a shot.
---
Hmm, I know right clicking. That toggles it. But with what I'm talking about, right clicking again doesnt change anything back. It's like that toggle frame doesn't exist.
---
To add to this, Doing the torch room Emperor farm with 3 or 4 mages and a priest is about 150K exp an hour if you have a good group and or you are in discord and are friends makes it a ton easier. 
---
The mobs never, ever stop respawning until you complete the gauntlet hence the insane exp you can get there.
---
Why are you trying so hard to defend your position when you're clearly wrong lol.  It's going to be okay man
---
There's good advice in quite a few of these but this one covers the most
---
https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1180220644249739265?s=20
---
You don't move on from MC. It contains vital pieces of gear especially moving into BWL (This also applies to Ony as well). And there well also be plenty of players taking their time leveling and looking to raid MC.
---
Ambassador Flamelash in brd :)
---
Yes it does. I was at 60g at 35 and I got my mount at 40 with only a 5g loan from a friend
---
I caved after farming air for 3 hours and got 1 drop. Spent 500g instead of my epic mount
---
Not sure about a key to accept/turn in quests, but I would definitely look for a quest addon that auto-accepts and turns in when talking to the quest giver. Could help minimize mouse movement.
---
I am probably not the best candidate for voice chatting often, but I would love to do so whenever possible. I will send you a request.
---
I play very irregularly, but my timezone isn't far off yours   (cest/gmt+2 atm), and I am typically online random days between 18:00 and midnight.
---
I would also happily "teach" you by letting you do your best and correcting grave mistakes in terms of language. 
---
Expect to hear my fiancée sing along to Xmas music in the background if we decide to voice chat. Xmas starts in July here.
---
I'll give you quick info regarding server etc too:
---
I currently play on Gehennas (horde) and Zandalar Tribe (alliance). Server choice is basically because my friends play on Gehennas and I know nobody on ZT.
---
I have no main faction or server but I'm leveling on Gehennas atm, possibly swapping back and forth depending on mood.
---
Lonely is right
---
In case you'd like to know, I was under the impression it was 30% , pretty sure that's what it was until WotLK, however, it only took a 15% cut
---
okay but what if I want something that I don't have? Assume I have money, and someone else has the thing I want - how do I go about getting it?
---
I suppose I could steal it from them. Maybe I could use my money as a weapon. Are there other options?
---
Has to be part of the bit. I hope. Has to be.
---
Alright man, its 4th October 2019 if 04.10.2019 is too hard for you XD
---
Poly in PvP is 8 seconds
---
Sorry but gathering quests are the worse thing to group on.  I've felt that way since Vanilla.  Any other quest sure! I'm fine with and frequently team up.  But needing X number of items....no way am I teaming up with 4 others so now we need the mobs to drop 4 TIMES as many items as before. And we all have seen those mobs who simply won't drop anything.
---
Well except cars have multiple gears and weapons don't. Shocking right? If car had 1 gear RPM would equal speed.
---
You do realize the old server stuff would shit out around 100 players?
---
No Blizzard server has ever handled 200v200 or anything like it.
---
See Wintergrasp if you were playing at the time.
---
High player counts are unlikely without back end rework.  We already know that pserver's used different coding on mobs, movment, batching, and pretty much every system.
---
Bulkkkkk!
---
Truth in advertising
---
Why would you bring druid when warriors can do that. Lols. Druids are for alt runs.
---
Grats man! That’s some serious dedication!
---
/cry at level 35
---
Yes, however phase 2 doesn't change anything for raiding it only adds additional 5 man dungeons and the honor system.
---
It means you have no evidence. You fear that a certain behavior is the true behavior, then base your feelings based on the first thing that can plausibly confirm it despite all other facts and evidence. Jesus I can't believe I have to explain this concept to someone.
---
I would turn off all buffs and blacklist spammy debuffs that get annoying.
---
The only things you really need to see at a glance are CCs affecting your healer or tank.
---
0.000000000000000% chance that was what caused that
---
I am being generous too.
---
You're quoting the wrong person. I already answered that your way of playing isnt universally fun for everyone and plenty of people enjoy getting valuable treasure to trade or sell for what they want. Your way to play isnt the only way to play  and it's not universally right.
---
If you dont want to buy it then dont. But you dont get to have a default on hundreds of gold because you can use something. Because everyone can use 100s of gold too. You want boes to feel like bops but they're not the same. So if you lose the roll then wait till next time. Just like you would if another person won anything else.
---
Yeah, I’ve just been walking upstairs. It works there
---
Here's the thing.  I don't hate him.  He isn't relevant to this sub.  
---
It's in Rule 1, mate.  "Not the place for streamer drama."
---
Word I had to look up the second troll racial that’s pretty sick does it stack with Mortal Strike for warriors?
---
Well except weapons have different item levels and cars don't. Shocking, right? If weapons had 1 item level speed would equal damage.
---
He's not particularly great at WoW either, he just spends a lot of time on it.
---
Yes! You need to hit +8% hit rating from gear in order to pass at dual wielding.
---
&gt; About 99% of people will play classic for 3 years and never see those gloves drop, do you not understand that?
---
So by definition, 1% of people will get it to drop it is POSSIBLE to obtain for free.
---
If your already talented into improved thunderclap, I might try to add it in after sweeping strikes, but I don’t actually use it for aoe threat. I use it to slow boss attack speeds down slightly but that’s all.
---
cause its easier to replenish 100 mana than 150. having 9999999 mana pool wont help u with regen. And healing is all about mana.
---
 effeciency
---
Get a laptop for yourself while the hand recovers, it's much easier with a touchpad near your hand.
---
Wow! Would you mind a summary of how in the fuck you did this? Just the rep grind would make me want to tear my hair out
---
/u/grandpatryhard, how do you do that?  I haven't been able to stealth out of combat before unless I vanish.
---
Now the true question, which do you like better?
---
Good ol ghetto hearth.
---
Battle Shout will be better and t-clap if you have the rage, but usually its easier and a better use of resources to tab and Sunder
---
Mc is not and will never be challenging to the majority of players.
---
It's 5 steps below retail lfr.

Warriors REALLY struggle if they are underleveled for the content they are facing. Against something 4 levels higher, each hit does a ton less damage and you'll be getting \~2 rage per hit at most even with a 2 hander.
---
Getting anger management is fine, and in fact most of your talents don't have a radical impact on threat generation at lower levels. Consider visiting your class trainer and training in rank 2 of threat generating abilities if it is available, that made a HUGE difference for me back then.
---
I called you a man-child way before that too. But I guess you didn’t catch that either. This argument has been over dude. You should learn from this and mature before you try to argue on the internet again. I could recommend you some books if you’d like.
---
you need exalted to train, not to buy

My husband and I met on WoW. We stopped playing a few years ago, but we recently got back into it and it's brought us closer together. I hope it does the same for you. &lt;3

Im not sure i could have resisted the temptation to just equip it.. its only gold...
---
I call mine big blue.

Yes thank you!!

Oh the irony

Noob here. I am really stagnating at level 48.

Where are good places to quest for lots of XP?

Im fully feral. Only issue I had was mana but innervate is pretty amazing for single 1v1

He’s mounted. He already bought his 40 mount.
---
\&gt;  there is more to it than just comparing two weapons on the same char. 
---
Thank you for agreeing with me, you're exactly correct. Which is precisely WHY weapon SPEED does not matter. I'm glad you agree with me. Now if only I could convince the rest of the community, maybe I wouldn't have to answer so many posts about it in the daily questions thread.
---
You seem like the negative person though
---
Get ready to have to hold her hand through everything.
---
Good luck man! Years ago my wife gave the game a shot. She spent most of the time staring at the ground. We played together till LVL 40 (with invite a friend XP boost) never could quite figure out mouse look and did not want to bind more that 4 skills. I never asked her play again. She is a terrible gamer. I was thrilled she tried but it was just not her thing.
---
I like this take thank you for your input before this thread gets lost to time!
---
I'm not sure what you mean, but you go to Keybindings -&gt; Action Bar, and the key "Special Action Button 1" will be Battle stance, 2 will be defensive, 3 will be zerker.
---
yeah, once you get to 5+ targets it's a bit of a lost cause if anybody does AoE.  That's all on the DPS to not be dumb.
---
You're correct, don't listen to that douchenozzle.
---
I vendor virtually all of my greens because people aren't willing to pay much for them - the servers are still fresh and people don't have a lot of gold. Meanwhile the deposit is a static percentage of the item's vendor value, regardless of what you're pricing the item at. So if at most you're asking for 150-200% of vendor value, it doesn't make sense to risk a deposit if the item isn't certain to sell.
---
On my server some of the more common crafting materials are also vendor trash (Silk, Medium-Heavy Leather, low level herbs) because AH price is barely over vendor value.
---
I guess it won’t be released until the other content in silithus is out.

Someone should commission an art piece for this

Complete sets are horrible for all classes for pve when compared to itemized

There's a wagon in the middle of Brill with a tiny rested patch next to it.

It’s seems about equal- the discussions that this generates would simply be more at home in a different sub. Here this post will create drama that is unwanted in this sub- other posts shitting on Asmand are in the same boat and should be somewhere else- but that doesn’t make this post anymore at home here.

Bigglesworth?

I'm thinking about rolling a warrior alt but I'm just a bit anxious about having to switch between weapons too much during combat. How much does it actually occur when you have to weapon swap? I just love 2H so I wanna do that as much as possible? I also see how much people need tanks on my main and it discourages me a tad since I wanna dps. Any thoughts?
---
This is so true
---
Big blueberry boi
---
they all do, especially priest. Idk what the other guy is talking about.
---
This could probably be made into a macro :)
---
yeah I hit 59 on my warrior main and got burnt out of doing BRD 40+ times not even seeing HoJ, so here I am
---
Are you using any action bar addons that you might need to turn that bar on?
---
I literally stacked only plus healing and mp5 until about 48 on my paladin, when I could start getting gear with a good mix of stats. Healing was a breez, downranking def has it’s place in leveling if you gear for it.
---
Sing to me, Paulo.
---
You can kill ragnaros in Hearthstone
---
This is super solid! Also nice to meet you! Curious if you know of any in depth technically focused warrior theorycrafting communities?
---
Look, as a gnome, I'm so short it may look that way but I can assure you that's not what's occurring here and I'm just wholesomely playing with my pet kitten
---
I had that problem when I started playing wow 15 years ago. Wow is a pretty good game to learn. Many other 3d games, like shooters, require you to be able to aim well. Wow does not. Just click the target and kind of face in the correct direction and you are good.  That right there makes it a lot easier to learn all the other stuff about moving in a 3d space. 
---
I hope you guys have lots of fun playing together, I really enjoy playing with my husband. It's fun 2 man leveling.
---
Could have went for ducks

I believe there was a theory that there is a+ 30second cap on any push-back in classic, but I never managed to get a spell that high.

Demonic runes.

Fucking Demonic runes.

Fighting him as a shaman is funny because each time your grounding totem eats a shadowbolt he yells that line.

"Yes, Archmage. You got another totem. Great work :)"

when someone starts speaking about xp/hour, spellcleave/meleecleave you know its probably going to be a bad group. those phrases are a huge red flag for me unless its just a casual thing.

only problem ive ever had in groups were those that were into the above things. majority of people are not like that and much friendlier.
---
Same here brother.
---
I mean that just says that leveling is such a shit experience that 30% of people would risk getting banned and pay huge amounts of money to skip it.

I don't want it to be added, but if blizzard went full retard and put level boosts in, I would buy that shit in a heartbeat.
---
If HS is queued your offhand can’t miss
---
Bro it's just 7g what? Lol go farm something for an hour and you got it
---
People usually only ask for windfury and rarely for grace of air depending on the class composition. Putting additional totems will always help but I have never seen people complaining about the lack of non-windfury totems when I get lazy.
---
Even defensive totems can pull enemies so you need to watch out for patrols spawning mobs and redeploy totems in a safe area to avoid aggro. 
---
You shouldn't be totem twisting if you are healing unless you're running content you're sure you can handle, otherwise you rise going out of mana, but even when I play as DPS role I do not twist totems out of laziness and never had a complain. You would have to be playing with some real tryhards for that to happen. 
---
I havent respec'd to restoration yet but I can run all dungeons up to UBRS absolutely fine with healing gear equipped. I was even invited to heal in Onyxia without being spec'd on restoration since I don't want to respec before I have an alt character capable of farming world PvE.
---
You automatically have 300 in all your skills for pvp.  So he has the same miss chance as anyone else.

Horde is better anyway. Only reason to be alliance is for pretty faces

I think you replied to the wrong person because this is unwarranted, or maybe you don't know what "entitled" means. But in case you meant to reply to me, why are you insulting me? What did I do to you? Why are you a mean person?
---
Did you even read my post and the edit? Clearly it was a misunerstanding about the prices. That's my fault because I replied quickly without doing research after seeing the price. How does that make me entitled? Why are you a jerk?
---
what a negative outlook you got there chief. Personally I HOPE bgs are stacked 10v10 twink all the time, that'd be intense. I spend my time dueling people in their 30s, so I dont understand why everyone here seems to think twinks just want to one shot people.
---
its like, if you were gonna play baseball, and had the ability of an mlb player, why play like youre in little league?
---
How do Warlocks tend to scale as raids get released? I hear in Molten Core they tend to be middle of the pack; do they get worse, better or stay about where they are after BWL, AQ etcetera get released?
---
I would say that and the gnome racial are the under actually used racials.
---
But he’s a mage. Should have had more than 3 gold to spare at 40 and he’s 3 bars from 42.
---
I went alchemy / herb with my warrior for this reason, but being on a PVP server I noticed that if I'm running around with an elixir I'll be ganked much faster than without. Probably just coincidental, but it does sweeten the gank knowing it cost the person something other than their time.
---
Healing potions, rage potions, and free action potions are definitely a huge benefit though.

That’s a pvp server for ya

I never said anything to the contrary. You are so dense as to not even understand the words that I type. Still you dont understand that watching good people play can benefit anyone. Its not like skarm is somehow conducting brain surgery with a thunderfury. Get over yourself.  You post about "god complex" tanks..... takes one to know one I suppose...
---
Incredible Warrior Tricks is a classic!
---
It does kinda suck. My original warrior was a prot tank, but I dropped points into Tac Mast, Imp Charge, and Imp TClap specifically so I could charge, stomp, stance change, Battle Shout, Demo Shout, then go into my Shield Slam/Revenge/Sunder rotation. It gave a healthy chunk of AoE threat and mitigation on the pull, although it didn’t play well with CC (or LoS pulls).
---
I've heard recently that some of the most intense theory crafting warriors are advocating for leveling with sunder over heroic strike because a heroic strike consumes rage instead of generating it. So the idea is you have more rage for the next pull even if you take 1 seconds longer to kill the enemy.
---
I was also wondering this. Cenarion Hold innkeeper was of no help either.
---
Atlasloot says it’s not until a later phase as well.
---
I've found they're almost always worth selling, but if the stats are bad only list them high enough to make a small profit over vendoring, and don't trust whatever prices other people set if any.
---
Weapons are the exception, any weapons with bad stats (especially caster) just vendor.
---
Hunters also have the easiest levelling experience and regularly solo elites that other classes can't even look at, so it kinda evens out.
---
Enchanting + tailoring is widely considered to be the poor mans professions just because of how much gold they require to level. You'll certianly have to grind for gold with this profession  combination. Good luck though!
---
Except you're wrong, lmao. Otherwise with every new expansion, they wouldn't have gravitated to making each spec more solidified in their role. Even the expansion *right after* Vanilla, The Burning Crusade, all the specs were created to be more and more about what Blizzard wanted in those specs. The specs of classes are obviously intended as a means to choose a way to play the game. And as a warrior, they obviously intended to have you choose between DPS and Tank, not Tank or Other Tank.
---
Where is your evidence that a class has to be a specific role when they are capable of two or more things? Because it sure looks like you're pulling it out of your ass.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
___
---
**TLDR of the next section**
---
-
---
The talents themselves are indicative of the intended split between a DPS role and a tank role. There is no evidence to support that "Warrior = Tank only". 
---
Why don't you look at another class? Priest. Is Shadow a form of healing spec? What talents in Shadow help healing? Literally zero. What talents in the other two trees (Discipline and Holy) help **shadow** DPS (because shadow is obviously their intended DPS spec)? More importantly, why is it those who go into the Disc and Holy trees deep enough can't enter Shadowform, the intended Priest DPS spec.
---
So now look at the warrior talents. In the protection tree, there are talents for Defense, increased Block Chance, Armor Value, resisting CC, increasing threat generated even further, making Shield Block more effective, increasing survivability with Last Stand, making their threat generation move "Sunder Armor" cost less, making Taunt more effective by reducing its cooldown, making a defensive ability "Shield Wall" more effective by increasing the duration, and an ability for slamming the opponent with a shield, producing high threat and silencing them to prevent further damage.
---
Protection sure has a shit ton of talents to help a tank do his job. Now let's look at the other two specs combined which have talents to help tanking.
---
Increased parry chance, but placed at the beginning of the tree so even a Prot tank can get it. The ability to conserve rage when switching is not a tank talent, it's a general talent, because Warriors have useful abilities in all stances. Charge giving more rage is a general talent. And that's about it. Every other talent is about giving tools that aren't intended to give more threat, control the mobs, or increasing survivability. The healthback in Arms is a means to heal oneself in battle... but what's the point in self healing if you're supposed to have healers in PvE content? Arms was intended to help with PvP encounters mainly. In fact, a talent in Arms decreases your armor so you can do more damage. What does that sound like? Does that sound like a tank to you?

You can dps if you want. Dont be pressured to tank.

Shield are necessary for shield bash and shield wall. Other than that you can 2h the rest of the time.

Classic was even more skewed. But you know that. You’re just being difficult at this point because you realize I’m not going to be belittled by your pathetic insults.. bruv, you’re so bitter! Over a game! 😂😂😂😂😂

Watch from 18:50 on. How about you hear from the developers how they intentionally aren't releasing anything about the exact numbers and the shit is dynamic. And the layering system is pervasively attempting to reach a balanced state with equal population that could be defined as a multiplier.
---
They were limited to 20 in vanilla so they are in classic.
---
Technically helps melee in world pvp.
---
I think it’s actually cheaper in Europe, but don’t quote me on that.
---
It's hilarious to me how slow people are to adapt. I still see so many hunters/druids/spriests soloing her for dog shit money because they can't think up a decent farming method on their own. And I'm not some gold tycoon either but you can make better money killing random level 55 mobs somewhere.
---
Whaaaaaa that’s crazy. I wonder if there’s a cancel HS macro that will keep it queued without using rage
---
cost savings is huge with little benefit
---
Laughs in pve server
---
You’re on my server! Congrats on ding!
---
As a prot warrior who is leveling a farming alt, I highly recommend hunter.  But holy shit, it's so easy it's almost boring.
---
I prefer the feeling of adventure you get from walking there. Summoning stones would make the world feel less alive.
---
Running into higher level players en route to dungeons makes the game feel alive to me and can lead to awesome world PvP moments. 
---
It also makes Warlocks so useful and desired, so it would take away from one of their coolest class features.
---
Except that's not what all your supporting evidence stated. Which is precisely WHY I started discussing this, because speed is NOT the deciding factor. You even supported that with your statement, but for some reason your conclusion doesn't match your premise.
---
 I'm almost 30, probably over 80% of the non-weapon greens I put up sell for a decent profit over vendoring, especially if they have decent stats.
---
Vendoring was good advice the first few weeks, but higher levels with alts or friends/guild mates have enough money to buy some extra gear now as long as you keep the prices reasonable.
---
You do have to make sure to ignore any existing prices set on the same item - at least on my server, people seem hell-bent on listing lowbie greens for insane prices which of course never sell.
---
Idk I’m up to 7ish days played on classic since Sept 6th, so a lot of time spent playing on a laptop keyboard, and I’m yet to have any wrist issues.
---
I would also love to see this
---
My husband turned me onto Wow in BC. I'm still playing retail in addition to classic.  The advice here is good. My sons helped me a lot at first.  She doesn't need to be a gamer, she can be a wower!   Oh yeah, getting broken in was hard the first 2 weeks. Motion sick and dreamed of nothing but Wow.
---
What a troll. Nothing you said reflects what I said.
---
Lets see.... I went to a Dead Can Dance concert last year. And in february will go to a Dream Theater concert.
---
Its clear that Im playing wow and listening to rap.

Anyway... Only soft side I have is the fact Im still replying to a moron like you.
---
You can make BANK by being hated, it's pretty amazing. I'd definitely play a villain if I ever got some sort of media platform where I could make money. People like Justin Bieber and Conner McGregor and even smaller time people like Asmon are just really smart I feel like. Once you get the hate from a community like reddit or twitter I'd try to grow that hate as much as I could so I could be on the front page 6 times a week.
---
Like if I'm Asmon I'd make my room even messier and "try to get away" with ninja looting even more. I hear this is why people dislike him the most.
---
I will say though, this doesn't work on retail, so they might've done something in the 8.0 patch or in the Classic version to un-fuck this from the retail version, because I used to use this trick in BC/Wrath to my own benefit.
---
Interesting!
---
So like 2.7 speed polearm drops and it's upgrade to both warrior and hunter. How do you decide where it goes as raid leader? Look at it's damage?
---
Them: Can you heal?
---
Me: I do indeed have healing spells.
---
A little truth to this... I would know :P
---
Ha I'm 36 and I have 4 gold lol
---
What does that mean?
---
better
---
Wasn’t quite sure but this doesn’t seem worth it compared to that one
---
For something that valuable, isn't it worth advertising in Trade chat instead?  You're losing a lot through the posting deposit and AH cut.
---
100% a qol improvement but definitely no changes. In wrath I didn't have an idea where half the instances were, geography-wise, cos as a tank I was instagrouped and summoned. You have to admit the trek down to wc is pretty awesome for alliance and vc pretty cool for horde.
---
never played a mage before... what makes it so surprising for a mage?

I like the huge wpvp fights like 40v40 though.

There is no "best" guild, lmao. You do realize that there are multiple *types* of guilds, right? There are leveling guilds, PvP guilds, raiding guilds, casual guilds, casual raiding guilds, casual PvP guilds, etc etc. A casual raiding guild doesn't give a single flying fuck if you're not an optimal spec. A guild can be the best "hardcore raiding guild", but there is no "best guilds" because guild is too general of a concept to apply an attribute of good or bad to all of them. Context matters.
---
&gt;Yeah, I can 100% assume people don't want to waste hours trying to clear Molten Core. It just seems obvious, IDK why you think guilds would want to run people who objectively slow them down.
---
Then this shows your lack of understanding of how people work. Yes, there are guilds who want to clear content fast. There are guilds who want to have objectively better classes. But shoot, you've obviously ignored the existence of guilds who play casually and more for the fun of being in a group with their friends. These guilds exist and I know this because I've been in some. The most notable example was "Ohana" from back when I played on a WotLK private server. They didn't rush through content. When we got stuck on a boss, they didn't think about replacing someone with a more optimal spec or gear or even competence. We just did the raids to have fun together. In Ulduar, we got stuck on a boss for a couple hours for a couple weeks, and while it was frustrating, we didn't care in the grand scheme of things. At no point was it even considered to replace people and get more skilled/geared/better specced people. And when I was a raid leader of the second ten man group, the same shit happened and my fellow guildmates / friends just wanted to be around the group and have fun.
---
I think I've had to corpse run like a grand total of 2 times while lvling to 60 with succ and draintank build
---
It sure does! But it is strictly inferior to revenge and sunder for rage per second on a single target. So I use a shout or two to get more aggro than the healer is gonna generate then focus on skull, and tab target around for sunders.
---
Because they don't want to get farmed the entire time while playing
---
Yes and no. Any leveling guide is written from the perspective that you will be, more or less, power leveling. And aside from warriors and to a lesser extent rogues, the power leveling strategy is to not do dungeons and you will have very little rest exp. Leveling guides also rarely have you doing green zones/quests, so the issue that arises for warriors is that unlike most classes, the optimal leveling strategy isn't the absolute fastest. Warriors tear through mobs a few levels lower than them, with weapon skill and armor rating really making a huge difference, and with rest exp, you easily make up for grinding greens (while you have it). Also, obviously dungeons or grouping with healers in general take warriors from C to S tier, while not as good exp as a hunter on the solo grind, is totally decent. 
---
Basically, it's bad if doing it in as few real life days as possible, but it's possible to have a very respectable /played if you are good about using rest exp and dungeons.
---
You can use your smartphone as a mic by using the discord app.  
---
Getting bis drops from running instances can be daunting.  Depends on how you feel about running the higher end instances numerous times.  Luck on your side will shorten that endeavor.  
---
Also, with a good raid group you can feel safe not having every possible bis item, but it is a good idea to be fully prepped for battlegrounds.  
---
Hope this helps!
---
How can anyone choose to play and not sleep or work? That's silly. There are good points to make, but this isn't one of them.
---
Quick comment, classic has a much bigger spell batch window than retail, not smaller, but that is indeed what is making it possible to do such things if timed correctly.
---

Yeah that sounds more feasible

Honestly as long as these guys avoid local Eastern European IPs they should be fine.  It's Bliz just assuming that they're buying boosts.

Succ is best for leveling, warlock leveling record was obtained with it

Find a fish in town.
---
The 40s are probably the toughest part of leveling.  At 48 you can technically so Searing Gorge but it's best to wait til around 50 to do that.  If you haven't yet, finish all of Tanaris, Feralas, Hinterlands, and STV.  If you have, try spamming ZF, it's popular and pretty good XP.
---
whtever u have to say to make urself feel better about being the whineyest bitch in wow classic
---
Well either the item gets reserved or literally anyone that can use it won't ever get an invite.
---
Which would you prefer? I know I'd rather people just reserve it, since that allows half the classes to get into the group if they aren't going after the item.
---
Awesome. Spectacular info. Tysm
---
Everytime my rogue friend starts talking shit about how he could beat my warrior I gotta remind that human how superior I am.
---
Paladin was my main in vanilla (which was my first MMORPG).  My biggest regret as someone who raided up to Naxx40 was not rolling a Warrior instead, Paladins were just such shitty tanks and DPSers in comparison.  I still can't believe they *removed* Crusader Strike rather than giving it a simple 6 s cooldown, that would improved Ret's gameplay so much over simply auto attacking and waiting for SoCasino
---
I didn't make that mistake this time again and I'm having a blast with my Warrior now
---
Few things wrong with your test. 
---
1.	I’m only lvl 44
---
2.	We don’t have similar gear
---
3.	There’s no good way to measure raw healing. 
---
4.	It doesn’t measure threat generation. 
---
5.	It doesn’t account for NS and Swiftmend.
---
6.	It doesn’t account for cast time decreases. 
---
7.	It doesn’t account more mana regeneration. 
---
Long story short you can heal while spec’d feral but it’s ignorant to say it’s remotely close to equivalent.
---
1 hearth per hour and astral recall (shaman hearth) every 15 minutes
---
Ty for putting that info in to my perspective. I suppose it doesnt seem so bad
---
Where do you suggest we farm Argent Dawn? Kill rando UD for tokens? Or just strat on repeat?
---
I'm a Shaman and I feel like I can traverse water better than using the trinket in most cases.
---
But that's not the main reason. I have this weird undefined desire to wear the best fishing gear available in the game. The fact that the pole is literally "the best fishing pole available in the entire game", is intriguing.
---
In my wildest fishing dreams, I have the fishing hat and boots, all enchants, the event pole enchanted with the event line. But IDK, it's not worth it at all, you don't need that fishing skill for anything.
---
I actually won it on retail before, but I took the heirloom ring.

I'm pretty sure no sort of dot-like ability will proc Judgement of Wisdom/Light.
---
I can’t imagine playing on a desktop; I play in my bedroom/office/living room/kitchen/alongside my friend at his house, hell I’ve even played in coffee shops and pubs (UK btw) since classic came out. And you don’t lose any graphical fidelity/performance on a game like WoW if your laptop is half decent. Laptops are perfect for time consuming games like MMOs.
---
Yea but these are low population dead realms
---
this staff is 100% a noob bait
---
I was thinking the exact opposite.
---
I won it 1 time on retail actually, on a new realm with a character that just had its 60% mount.
---
60% or more of healers on any server just suck at conserving mana period.

keep it and roll a twink c:

Exactly. I did the same for robes of the void recipe on my warlock. I was the only warlock, had 300 tailoring and informed the group that it was because of the recipe. It dropped and I learned it in front of them. People are scum and will need shit like that for gold or for off spec. Don't be op and leave ruining the group because you're butthurt. It just makes you look like you planned for need roll on some shit you had no business rolling on.
---
And to be clear, I didn't announce reserved in my advertisement because it wasn't reserved. If other locks joined it was free roll. Even still, I'd master loot so me and the other warlock could roll against each other.

Most of the posts are hate posts lol

It workd? Did you get your virginity back?

Hey Op, if you’re warrior friend wants to talk over discord or in game for some tanking advice I’m glad to help with any questions about it. 
---
I’ve been: warrior tank since wrath

I’m on mobile and out so I can’t really answer the questions in depth, but will do so later when I’m at my computer.
---
Also Skarm on YouTube has some pretty good warrior tanking videos based on classic.
---
The most effective opener ive found is pre zerk rage-&gt;b stance charge then tclap&gt;d stance bloodrage demoshout&gt;shield block revenge tab sunder. Many of those abilities are not on gcd so you can execute the whole combo in 2/3 globals.
---
Thanks! This guide would not have been possible to perfect without the amazing **Fight Club** [discord](https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw) community, especially **Magey** (who did / does most of the actual math behind Classic Warrior and general melee mechanics). A ton of the other colored peoples (Babyhoof, Oliver and Scylla, especially) also helped with whatever questions I had along the way :) and they also helped the Wowhead writer so, all in all, this is the place to be for Classic Warrior theorycraft, imho!

How can I toggle healing numbers? When I heal another player I would like to see how much I healed.

Im mainly referring to loot priority taking massive ammounts of gold and absuing peoples desire to be in guild and in group with him. And no every celebrity does not have such a relationship with their fans.

Oh man you just get more toxic the more you dig in. I feel sorry for the people who have to deal with you. I choose to entertain your dumbassery purely for sport. Those who played retail classic would agree with me. I bet you never even played then. It would make since, since you tried to argue spriest “shits on mages” and “is a toss up with locks” LOLLLLL

I feel like I should pay you for your time. You’re quite the clown. A very angry clown at that. I’m gonna stop replying to you now because frankly, you’re a very boring and draining person to talk to. You should look into that growing up thing I mentioned in one of my previous comments. Now as much as I know how much you just love responding to my comments and making yourself look like the angry little man that you are, all good things must come to an end. Just know that your replies have given my discord server and guild many laughs. I’ll remember you as, Mr. Transmog Ruined Wow. May God have mercy on your soul.

Ah ha! I thought this might be a Fight Club associated account. I heard a couple guys from that community speak on the countdown to classic podcast. Was super informative and very interesting. I'll need to consider joining that community.

Either that or the stats, obviously. The same way you evaluate every weapon in practically every game with weapon upgrades.

Your bloodline is weak and your progeny will not survive the winter. Begone from Fairbanks, alliance scum. It belongs to the horde.

You can use Questie and turn off the auto-accept &amp; turn in!  The story line is so crucial to a game like WoW, especially if you're trying to get a non-gamer to care about what he/she is doing.

I don’t understand why people hate Asmongold so much. Is he really that bad? I have mostly seen his “Asmongold reacts” stuff that people clip and put on YouTube, so maybe I need to check out some more vids to understand why. There’s a guy in my guild who will lose his shit if you even say his name.

"divine steed" truly is a gamebreaking pvp skill.

Is there no trainer in theramore? Seems like an oversight by jaina if not
---
Also if you really come to grips with Warrior mechanics, consider a 2H arms build for tanking leveling instances. But if you go that route, really make sure you research up on how to execute it properly. I've written a short baseline guide on how to do so but there's also the Icey Veins guide which is overall more informed than I am on the technical side of Warrior and threat mechanics.

All Tor exit nodes are publicly listed due to the nature of the protocol and can be queried using various APIs, so as far as I know it's impossible to hide the fact that you're using Tor from the destination server using just Tor alone. You could hide it from your ISP by setting up a bridge, but the destination will always be able to know.

Stop tell the healer to drink and don’t pull until they do.  I don’t remember what level mobs are in Mara but even a single level can make a huge difference dps wise.

I was so worried about not having mount money I saved everything I possibly could, by the time I hit 40 I had enough for my mount, the backlog of unpurchased skills plus a full set of matching mail gear for my hunter.

Ah, my wife and I used to play together. I was a healer, she was a tank. It went exactly how you'd expect.
---
Is it really plastic?  How did you find out?
---
You can stick to DPS with 2H and never switch weapons if you desire.
---
You will probably be chastised for not being flexible, but it's your time and your money so play it how you like.
---
I will say that if you take the time to learn how to tank, you will never have to wait to do any dungeon in the game. You can effectively tank with a 2H for 90% of low level dungeons, and maybe only switch to 1H and Shield for bosses.
---
Mailbox
---
Some groups work that way. But minimizing drinking time and maximizing your ability to heal are important skills for a healer. You don’t want everyone completely topped off all the time. For example, unless it’s a fight I expect the tank to take big damage, I will let the tank go down to 50% or sometimes less then drop a heal or two. And then stop healing unless someone else needs it. Basically, you hold off healing as long as you can and then you burst heal everyone up. 
---
More complicated healing involves using down ranked heals. While doing so can be useful early on it becomes imperative once you get geared at 60. 
---
With that said, don’t be too aggressive with letting the party get low before healing. You should be more conservative when new to a dungeon or group. If it’s a group I have played with in a dungeon I am familiar with, I am more willing to let the tank get low. Pug tank in a new dungeon? I am going to be less mana efficient and be quicker on the heals. Why? I am not familiar with how quickly the random tank may go down nor with how hard the mobs hit but as the dungeon progresses, and I get a feel for the tank, I may start being more efficient with heals again.
---
Extra tool to deal more damage with Judgement of Command, too.

Is the quest for lock level 60 mount out yet or is that a later patch.

That's not necessarily true!  If she's interested in playing *something* but has no idea what, you can always try to find more basic things for her on Steam!

It says it does 100-200 damage, how does it help you decide if it goes to hunter or warrior?
---
I'm guessing your dad left you? So leaving your guild is the same as him leaving u? I guess....

If you think the difference in ranking or not ranking will come down to someone fighting less bubble hearths than the next person your mistaken. This is a small percentage of random encounters...

The core framework of the classes in Classic determine role. Future Expansions are completely irrelevant to Classic Design. The game went askew in 2.0, and has gone further wonky as they refined it in every successive expansion. Even if the designers didn't intend for all Priests to be healers and all Warriors to be Tanks, the design of the class leads to that naturally, the tweaking from specializations not significantly changing that - After all, Enhancement Shaman is clearly meant to be a tank in classic based on its specializations and associated skills, but we know how that worked out in practice (And it became Another DPS with the future expansions)
---
You don't need any talents to do the class's core job in Classic. They just make it easier.
---
Shadow Priest helps Heal because the class is a Healer framework - It has all the tools and then some to be a healer. But, it can also DPS, clearing mobs faster (Hardest control condition is Dead - Dead enemies do 0 DPS to the tank), meaning less to heal.
---
The way Classic's classes filled the roles are nowhere near as rigid as the homogenized tapioca they were refined into through the future expansions.
---
Dwarves are amazing. Probably my second favorite behind Tauren.
---
There's a huge amount of dps to comb through and you can be pretty picky.... I take mages, and warlocks of everything so I get all the melee gear. A lot of people do. Not gunna find a lot of warrior that want to roll against an enhancement shamans on BiS melee gear.
---
I did 2h tank as i leveled. Now im figuring out the best way to tank 5mans at 60 but not be prot. I hear about fury tanking. I dint have much info on it besides my assunptions. Im assuming i need some better gear to be doing that. Like atleast a full set of plate dps gear that will keep me with decent mitigation as well as still being able to put out dps for threat
---
I don't wanna play bfa, there is nothing wrong with complaining about an obviously unbalanced pvp system

yup. depending where the GY is, you could have killed that hunter and tamed BT before they got back to their corpse. i would have 100% and i dont even play hunter

First, you throwing out FS on runners puts you in a better class than 90% of the healers I've seen thus far.

Second, a simple cheese omelette is a woefully underrated breakfast.

Molten core they are dead last of the pure dps classes due to 16% chance to miss on spells. They start to compete once they have full bwl and zg gear, notably the hit pieces. By naxx assuming they flask they are number 3ish dps.

Shoulda put a few more copper into the bank to make it more believable.

As a rogue I'm insulted by your inability to apply a dot.  You should delete your priest.  As a priest I'm doubly insulted at your inability.

I couldn’t recommend this. 31/5/15 is garbage for raids (can’t use MS). So if you’re tanking raids it’s bad, and if you’re tanking anything other than raids you should just go normal arms DPS/PvP spec.
---
Thanks good advice and im glad its not just me

It looks like he put up a good fight.

I've yet to have a rogue escape me. And if you can't kill a pally you're fucking bad, and you should feel bad.

Comet, the person who rolled need on the first one, is a mage. Of course he’s going to need that.
---
Yeah the fear prediction won it
---
I think those are both good assumptions! You definitely want at least the 8% hit rating threshold before considering dual wield fury tanking. Skarm has some good youtube videos on that subject.
---
Are you new to Reddit? People post bullshit embellished stories all the time. Go look at /r/askreddit post comments

Lol wtf does this even mean.
---
You evaluate both of their current weapons, but that would go to a hunter. There's swords in the 40s with higher weapon damage than that, so no Arms warrior would need that.

Now if you want to come up with something clever I'll happily read it.  So let's see whatcha got!

Thank you. It never occurred to me that they were friendly dwarves. I've only ever done Uldaman as Horde.

I disagree that gear funneling may be true in the mAin 40 man raid, not so in the others. but there are 1000 members at least 200 on at all times raiding and making groups. With all the members filling a group is quick. It feels more active than a vanilla wow server.
---
That just adds an extra button for him to press.
---
Blacksmithing and Engineering are the absolute min/maxers professions. But if you're that invested in min maxing, then you'll be levelling engineering *twice* in order to get all the best gnomish and goblin stuff. Goblin first, iirc.
---
Just pick professions you like.
---
I don't care weather it bothers you or not, I'm just being honest
---
Tbf it's pretty fat bait, but rather appealing too
---
No, the reason I ask is because I wondered if the mind control player bar was maybe, like, PetBar2 or something which might be turned off by default with Bartender4 or other addons. I hope you can resolve this problem! I've never gone Gnomish Eng before so I have no idea.
---
Where does it say that?
---
In my experience almost exactly twice as fast (counting /played per level dungeon farmin vs questing)
---
Don't. I still got tailoring on my priest lol (same thing applies - robe of exalted blue drop is basically equivalent to the expensive tailoring BoP epic chest). Only because I figured I can make money along the way or craft some other pre-raid BiS stuff. Who knows, might get lucky getting hold of the pattern. And yeah, there's that set bonus too.
---
Regardless of healer efficiency, you cannot hand wave away the damage formulas.  
---
Damage Incoming - Damage Mitigated = Damage taken  
---
The vast majority of damage mitigation is non-scaling, and thus large pulls are net decreases in speed unless the extra AOE kill speed outweighs the extra downtime from taking more damage.
---
For most full hp elites, this is not the case unless you can cause additional mitigation (usually via freeze kiting or cooldown stacking).
---
False
---
Great video and great play. Shotcalling was on point too.
---
Kill a rabbit and skin it
---
I agree with both comments.
---
Replace Smithing with Engi, and I would've thought you were me.
---
Seriously?  That's the retort?  That braindead = honest?  Surely you can do better than that.
---
I'm level 35, my heal costs 305 mana.  So it is 10 seconds.  And I get those ten seconds throughout the fight.  I heal in bursts then wait.  Every 4 full ticks of mana gives me another heal.  Easily doable during fights.
---
Absolutely not. Once you hit 36 and if you're Arms, you will have access to Sweeping Strikes and Whirlwind. You melee cleave with those two abilities (and a WF totem if Horde).
---
Seeing as you seem to stalk everyone's history you shouldn't be shocked.

I hate how much he ruined classic...

He's so annoying and has so many clueless babies following him that his videos just suppress all the good ones.  And there are like 100 AsmonClips channels.

He's rude to his viewers and he isn't good... Why is he so big...
---
My handle in game is slightly different. PM me if you end up on Earthfury and I'll hook you up. 😊
---
As you can see in the picture the hunter literally passed on the robe. The mage isn’t selling it for gold. The mage is learning the pattern to make a mage only robe.
---
I'm not interested in impressing losers online, especially the braindead ones.
---
If you're level 60 you've put in at least 5 hours a day for a month and that is not a normal amount of time to play games, that's like top 5% of players. I would assume most people with jobs typically dont have time to play 5 hours a day. I have about 2 hours on a good day, more like 1 hour each weekday with a full time job.

I believe none. On almost every realm there is a Horde majority, which makes life as an Ally a living hell.

I literally dont know what you mean by "threat", but go ahead about crying how unfair everything is and how you should win every pvp encounter
---
First mistake was going to Staples, they're a retailer with a small print shop - go to FedEx Office (if you want to do it with a foamboard mount as well they have a 50% off sale coming up in less than two weeks) or hit a smaller mom&amp;pop printer in your area.
---
Good luck! I've never managed to capture a shot like this, but I imagine most people haven't either.
---
I've only PUG'd (or at most had 1 or 2 people I've seen before in my party) and every dungeon is pretty much new to me at this point so, yeah... full on, no efficiency, don't-fuck-this-up, output mode.

They got rid of layers on most servers, and ones they didnt only have 2 layers now.

This is not new

They just feel so stiff.

Lol. Maybe he was RPing

Is it against TOS to facilitate communications between factions on a PvP server? If not, I'm as lost as you are.
---
Indeed. I get random whispers from people on the other side of the fucking world asking me if I'll tank something.
---
Its the first time I see it! At a first glance looks nice..and big :) will save it on my bookmarks to read properly tomorrow, got some important work that I need to finish &amp; deliver tonight, guide related!

Keep trying to hide your tears, it must be tough braindead...
---
Spoiler, PvE servers have PvP.
---
Just not in the pervasive "shit covered coin" way.
---
this is nice :)
---
I was considering leveling a paladin as prot just so I can find groups easier and I like tanking.
---
But everyone says prot is super slow to level and to go ret. But assuming I level prot with a 2h, I don't really see how not going ret is massively slower.
---
By not going ret I lose 6% damage and 15% damage only on crits. 
---
I don't see how not going ret is massively slower?
---
They aren't worse to be in. It literally depends on your goal. That's what you aren't getting through your thick head. You think guilds are all about going through content quickly and well. They aren't. You can be in an effective raiding guild all you want, just stop being ignorant and telling people that there isn't an incentive to have a less effective player, because not everything is about results.
---
Quickly? Not really.
---
Fastest route: Boat to Auberdine. Pick up flightpath. Take other boat to Menethil Harbor. Pick up flightpath. Swim south along the coast until you are in Dun Morogh. Drown yourself and rez at the spirit healer. Run north to Ironforge. Pick up flightpath and take the tram to Stormwind. Pick up flightpath and train swords.
---
You were circumventing the factions in game, or rather offering to.  Next step we have translators charging 5g to pass a message to the opposing faction.  If the player wants to bnet friend them and make contact on their own so be it but services to send messages cross faction most definitely should not be allowed and I'd support that ban.
---
Nnnno, you didn't. And I wasn't trying to "call you out" or anything, I apologize.

I thought he already sold the gloves

Venoxis of Lucifron. But both are Horde focused. The free transfer killed the ratio

Ok thank you.  So the prints look good?  Nice quality?

Do you have a normal hard drive to see if your ssd is giving out? Just install on the mechanical and see how it does. Also what's the CPU % and ram at while the game is running?
---
That is literally playing the ah...
---
Tell ya what my man...I'll just hang out here and watch for a good response, one that's a real stinger.  I wish you the best of luck ;)
---
That's not the reason. The reason is every class introduction video and wow guide says druids don't deal damage and are shit, their sole purpose is to carry a flag in a pvp mini game. They make it seem like wow is all about raids and nothing else matters.
---
Then people don't play druid. You see less druids on the street and think druids really are shit and nobody plays them.
---
And then one asks to join your dungeon group. You think he's going to hinder the group and don't want a dead weight slowing you down.
---
That's the reason.
---
Edit: and only cows can be druid in horde, which only makes things worse.
---
I've found success in dotting the main target with corruption/immolate and then just throwing curse of agony on the others. It does very little damage at first so you don't pull aggro and the damage pause on the main target gives the tank some time to get proper threat.
---
&gt; The mage isn’t selling it for gold.
---
Well first off, you have no way of knowing that, but even assuming that's the truth all he gets from winning it is gold.
---
Please explain, what tears?
---
Most computers allow for two mice to be connected at once.  Tape the bottom of one put it by your left hand and use it just to click what your right is over.

Hunter?

True. But im in too deep on PvP servers to ever have fun in PvE servers. And thats coming from someone who used to only play on PvE servers (Nazjatar and Tichondrius)
---
Cool. Thanks for the info!
---
It is just as likely, actually more likely that the item will be for someone else then any one person in the group.   How you get it is for his selfish self and not your selfish self is interesting.
---
It was defined that way in the bradygames guide books that are official and used to be included with the boxed game at times.   It was made more clear that is the intent when the game later was modified to make BoE become BoP when a need is selected.   I don't think anyone is arguing need/greed is perfect, and especially that the implementation does not have some flaws.  What the roll needers seem to miss is that if they are doing that they are not using need/greed anymore,  even though when people join the party look at what loot system is in use is says need/greed.  There is nothing wrong inherently with saying the rules are all role need.  The issue is that under the need/greed system that is ninjaing.  So people that do not want to use the need/greed system and also not be seen as antisocial nijaers need to declare and get consensuses on their use of the non standard system beforehand.

Is there any further discussion or mathing out of how much of a diminishing return it really is?

Blizzard CS said its an authentication issue atm

The ones streaming down your face right now

i wish cause that would be better. Shes a druid.

Yea this fucking meme about 2h tanking and fury tanking is hilarious.
---
Did you see the 'naxx fury tank spec' that doesn't even fucking have Tactical Mastery?  
---
80% of these types think they are doing 'more threat', when in reality they are just converting more of their HP into Rage, which allows more abilities to cover their poor ability priority when low on rage.
---
You can take more damage in prot spec by just taking off your pants, while still retaining all the tools.
---
Well my laptop is 18”, but also I plug into a big monitor when I play at my main desk 🤷‍♂️
---
Where does the gold come from? From spending hundreds of gold on materials to make the robe?
---
If he did, he bought/acquired another pair. They had someone from another guild (Crusade, I think, I can’t remember) hold them during the duels, and then he traded them to Quin on stream afterwards.
---
This will be me.
---
Agreed. At least people who got to 60 and wanted to play moonkin or something terrible back then didn't know. Now if you get to 60 and expect a raid spot as a moonking, enhancement or ret.... You're just an asshole.
---
From not having to buy the pattern? and you were calling me dense? Jeez.
---
Agree to disagree. I think the mount is a far better investment as it speeds up gold gains and xp gains by a significant amount and allows you to avoid getting ganked. I just can't justify buying gear that will be replaced quickly. Obviously there are some exceptions like weapons for rogues and warriors or wands for casters.
---
About what would I be crying? Are you projecting your emotions?
---
Homie i carry like **40** shards. How else will I be able to melt face with soul fire and shadowburn??
---
Just swim round the edge of the mountains until Moonglade pops up, drown yourself and rez sickness. Get the flight path and boom happy days.
---
Is this a mouse over macro? If yes add the showtooltip to the macro with the spell name and you can ignore the rank if you just want max rank.
---
I tried this with my GF and she just couldn't hang. So i said fuck it let's try retail before you just all out quit.  We're now lvl 70 and it's been a blast. Classic was just too hardcore and difficult for a complete gamer newb. Retail is a lot easier and will at least let you play together. Start her there so you can at least try to get her into it (i play classic when she doesn't play) then transition to classic once she's more experienced.
---
Oh very cool. Let me know if you are producing any new guides I'd love to read them!
---
Most likely succumbed to a poison debuff. May he rest in peace.
---
The creative thing to do would be to name it Hades, if you get what i mean ;)
---
Samesies. Gotta get that engineer out for PvP time
---
Check Blizzard cs. Authentication issue atm
---
It takes about 8-10 days played to get to level 60. That means literally 1/3 of his free time INCLUDING sleep was spent playing wow, that is crazy rushing and no normal person with a social life outside of wow, or any other hobby would be able to work full time and meet that goal.
---
Lol feral or resto?
---
Inb4 balance
---
&gt; he’s on screen
---
&gt; THAT’S the act!
---
You're starting to get it.
---
Casual guilds like that tend to bleed good members to the more hardcore guilds fast.  So you'll often end up with masses of casuals who don't use consume, don't know mechanics, and make raids that should be 2 hours take 8 hours.  I've been there, lots of others have been there.
---
Idk, you are braindead so you could be crying about anything
---
When does the Alliance attack Camp Tarjuo? My elf needs tauren blood.
---
Yeah, I can’t find a source that says anything like that, anywhere.
---
Hm, doing "research" on a guy you don't even like to prove he's not the asshole he presents as to everyone almost all the time...
---
I exclusively browse reddit on my computer.
---
even more impressive, I sent him this post like "See? It's possible to do single-day turnarounds!" 
---
Gotta prod the guy sometimes ;)
---
Well then why are you so insistent that you deserve the lot just because you can equip it?
---
Shouldn't be a problem. It's an interesting role to be a healer.
---
You can tank everything except main tanking MC in a dps spec. Arms is way better than prot for tanking dungeons. It sounds like with his guild he won’t be tanking MC so why recommend prot?
---
No, bgs were not cross realm originally and they implemented battle groups later but I am not sure when.
---
Spec shadow. Holy isn’t needed in dungeons.( until late game )As long as your tank isn’t trash your renew should be enough. Early level dungeons you really shouldn’t have to hard cast a heal
---
Also fuck those guys that said to play a different character.
---
Hunter, did a full bfd run without being a huntard. Didn't remember anything after turtle boss. Was messed up. My buddies said I did well, i just feel bad for putting them through that
---
Not really sure what you mean.
---
Classic pvp is fun but they ruined it with spell batching.
---
Why tf does asmon still have his lvl 40 mount? Doesn’t he just get fed gold? Lol
---
There is also one step on the stair that gives rested xp. Thats what i used.
---
Ah fuck I shoulda done this before I screwed myself in Tarren Mill with no UC fp.
---
They're those silly people with red names that try to bug you when you're questing sometimes.
---
Because I have no issues calling out ninjas?
---
Yea I think you're the one who needs to post their character name.
---
So asking why you are crying about classic being classic is crying? Is that what you are saying?
---
That ferocious howl tho. Solid skill for the gentleman raider
---
Because we're talking about raid bosses and 2h tanking them obviously. /s
---
It's low-mid level dungeons dude, shield block isn't needed for them.
---
Exactly lol. Apparently even though you can murder opposing faction players relentlessly (on pvp servers), it’s not yet implemented if you can’t queue for it or gain rank.
---
Seriously this is exactly what I'm looking for.
---
I don't really care about raiding (never have, not even in original vanilla), I just like the journey.
---
The rogue would have been squashed in the same time frame at equal levels. How would the warrior attack a stealthed rogue? The priest rolled on a pvp server. You didn't need to click this thread.
---
I bought it on Blizzard's Webshop when it was live.
---
no doxing plx ty
---
Fuck those guys, play healer and learn to heal.
---
You can level as shadow and still heal dungeons (just start by learning/watching YouTube) and respec I think, sorry not a healer (pretty sure)
---
Could you fellas rate these two builds:
---
 [https://puu.sh/EoSy6/4a0d8e16f3.png](https://puu.sh/EoSy6/4a0d8e16f3.png) 
---
 [https://puu.sh/EoSzU/685f302ee1.png](https://puu.sh/EoSzU/685f302ee1.png) 
---
I need a build where I can sub offtank when needed for a raid (I'd like to work up to being a second or main tank) while still being able to do content (dungeons, farming, etc.)
---
I don't know how this guy fits as a streamer which is supposed to entertain the audience.
---
Funny (as stated in the comment above/below) and Pshero on same sentence, that's not accurate at all.
---
For sure hes a hell of a Rogue, but that guys is basically a emotionless potato, he is the Kristen Stewart of WoW.
---
Félicitations!
---
Time for big weed n sexsy times ;))))
---
Don't listen to them. Just because you've never been a healer doesn't mean you shouldn't try. If healing is what you want to do, don't let them stop you. It's a game and it's meant to be fun, you do you 😊 priests are awesome
---
Both good choices. You should do Desolace and STV, too, the Rebel Camp in the north sound have some quests appropriate for your level.
---
Leveling as a paladin is already quite slow. Efficient, mind you, but slow. Even as ret, I pretty much always use Blessing of Wisdom while questing for the increased uptime. The ret talents can seem underwhelming, but Benediction, Imp Judgement, Seal of Command, Pursuit of Justice, and Sanctity Aura all have a cumulative effect.
---
If you’re deadset on paladin tanking, I would probably level as ret and heal dungeons for quick groups (you don’t need any talents in holy to heal, maybe just a few +int pieces you can grab off quest rewards/trash drops) until you get into your mid- to late-30s and then respec prot. Just my two cents though!
---
as a feral healer, i agree
---
Can't be much worse than spam invite guilds
---
How does mc trash pugs work (only clearing trash for boe). Can anyone with a raid lock join? Must everyone be either not locked or have same raid id as party leader?
---
Except that's not needed or recommend while leveling, it doesn't provide a static buff like Hunters.
---
So really it's a couple of slots and guess what, almost every class has to dedicate a few slots to reagents but they also have to buy them. Warlock is the cheapest class by far
---
Lol no I don't have one but maybe I should... not a bad idea.
---
No.... you clearly cant stop thinking about him. Its pretty clear how jealous you are, the 3rd grade insults are just pathetic. 
---
&gt;and yeah why u defend some1
---
Im not defending him, Im calling YOU out, theres a big difference that I doubt you would ever grasp.
---
I get it, you're a simpleton that wanted to jump the train, make a stupid comment, hepra derp hes bald GUIZE AMIRITE and rake in the karma. like pretty much this entire sub. 
---
&gt;why u defend some1 with nonsense if u dont want to go check what the person actually have said and done? 
---
Let me speak very very slowly. MAYBE you'll understand it then,
---
YOU made the claim hes a ninja looter, not me YOU. Normally the comments go by without being called out, well not this time, since YOU made the claim, im asking YOU to back it up, he has 100s of hours of videos since classic came out. Show me the ones that he ninja looted? 
---
&gt; u should proably pull ur head out of hes arse and drop the white knigthing lol.
---
Pretty typical response from someone getting called out, I get it, you're now defensive, you can only repeat what youve been told so  now you have nothing else to say,you're devolving into the typical troll lying about how very bad ass you are.
---
N-No...?
---
Classic PvP won’t be good until BGS and that’s like April 2020 ( what they have it scheduled at) world PvP can get boring, but once BGS come out. Classic all the way baby
---
Mine too!  But we start next week. :D
---
More idle games without an add-on! Think I'll test it out tonight in some dungeon runs. Thank you
---
Get your group mates to share it.
---
That's how I got it on my cow
---
You are crying right now lmao
---
I didn’t read it all but after the first paragraph I came to my conclusion. If I was the tank I would have just told the dps that I was newer and that I would like to instead of aoe’ing the packs switch to a single target strategy. Burn the gouging demon down first and you might not even see a gouged tank. If the group won’t change the tactic to fit the tanks ability they should just find a different group. Not all tanks have the same expertise. Like all archetypes and classes there is a wide range of skill levels. A truly amazing player can adapt to a tanks ability. If they can’t the problem is likely theirs.
---
Oh no ninja looters! What will I ever do after being upset for 10 minutes and then moving on with my life?
---
I resurrected someone today, who then immediately proceeded to get ganked by a shaman camping nearby. I didn’t have a lot of mana after the rez, and the guy I picked up had really low hp and mana compared to having run back normally, so we both ended up getting plowed. 
---
You win some, you lose some, I guess!
---
&gt;The core framework of the classes in Classic determine role.
---
Source? Where's the developer statement that says "class = role"? There is none, stop pulling shit out of your ass.
---
&gt;Future Expansions are completely irrelevant to Classic Design.
---
No it's not. Same developers wanting to expand on their vision. Granted, over time the developers will change, but not so much in the period of Vanilla to WotLK.
---
&gt;The game went askew in 2.0, and has gone further wonky as they refined it in every successive expansion.
---
Askew from what? There are some objective facts like flying help ruin world PvP and whatnot, but what made the game "askew" in class design specifically? You're just pulling shit out of your ass with zero source or even an explanation.
---
&gt;Even if the designers didn't intend for all Priests to be healers and all Warriors to be Tanks, the design of the class leads to that naturally, the tweaking from specializations not significantly changing that
---
Developers intentions &gt; Your values. The developers intending someone to play a class as DPS when the tank option is available means your opinion on a class being only a tank is invalid. End of story.
---
&gt;After all, Enhancement Shaman is clearly meant to be a tank in classic based on its specializations and associated skills, but we know how that worked out in practice (And it became Another DPS with the future expansions)
---
Just because they failed at hitting the mark on a single class doesn't mean jack shit. Mistakes happen, that doesn't support your point. It just means that Shaman isn't an effective tanking class, and it won't be optimal for raiding and whatnot.
---
&gt;You don't need any talents to do the class's core job in Classic. They just make it easier.
---
Almost like... the specs make the job the player wants to do more optimal at doing it or something? So like, the talents to increase damage and DPS make them a more optimal DPS candidate than a tanking candidate, and that the player should play the DPS class since that's what he's chosen to be his optimal setup.
---
&gt;Shadow Priest helps Heal because the class is a Healer framework - It has all the tools and then some to be a healer.
---
Then why aren't there guilds who have only Shadow Priests to heal? Your framework argument is meaningless, by the way. The same framework can be said for WotLK, but you'd die instantly in raids trying to tank as a "Tank framework" class there. Just because they have the tools doesn't mean they are any good with it, or that they should be used before getting the spec for their level. As you said, Shaman was intended to be tank, so why isn't it a tank? Because it doesn't perform optimally at it with the spec intended.
---
&gt;The way Classic's classes filled the roles are nowhere near as rigid as the homogenized tapioca they were refined into through the future expansions.
---
That's not relevant. It was intended for players to play how the fuck they want, and you opinion means jack shit. DPS warriors can DPS, and Tank warriors can tank. "But a warrior is a tank" is a meaningless statement because it lacks support from the developers intentions. End of story.
---
Blood and Thunder friend!
---
Yeah, I didn’t rush to get mine either, I was like half a bar from level 43 when I got it.  The only reason I wanted it was dungeon groups, I always felt so ashamed running to a dungeon and being minutes behind the rest of my group lol.
---
RemindMe! 1 week
---
Why are you assuming they are better?  You dont know anything about OP other than they like to make up pointless things to worry about for no apparent reason.
---
Dude everyone says this about the faction they arent on. Get a grip.
---
Thats wrong. Slow MH fast OH! You proc Sword-Spec from your OH, so you can get extra MH swings.
---
What's spell batching? Sorry to bother
---
That format is superior for archiving and data architecture
---
8/8 gr8 b8
---
My apologies if this has been answered before, but is the fishing contest out yet? If not, do you know when it does come out??
---
Farming is faster with a mount, plus, supply now should be low for rare enchanting materials due to relatively few lvl 60s farming them while demand should be high due to many people not being 300 yet. It might be a good time to sell now and buy later when you hit 60 when supply/demand potentially creates a more buyer friendly market and you can farm gold more effectively.
---
Nope every weekend I get drunk and play WoW on my main.    I'm getting old and senile though, so most folk probably can't tell the difference.
---
Still crying.
---
I'd watch that porno
---
You are retarded.
---
The majority of the player base.... If they want to rework and add content and do like a classic+ after Nax is done, fine. They aren't fucking changing it until then and it's not a sure thing they will after. So get used to it.
---
My character is a NightElf Female, so this could be a lucrative way to save up for the epic mount.  Especially given my ability to transform into such a wide variety of furry animals.
---
It’s benediction
---
I can't drink due to medical reasons, but I do have a 'drunk character', so to speak. He's a dwarf rogue who runs around barefoot and drunk all the time. He gets drunk for me.
---
Get a grip on what? Im just shit talking horde on Faerlina
---
Why does this read like you hate Asmongold but would gladly gobble on Soda and Reck's cock and balls?
---
And try being a bit more unbiased in your "serious answer", saying he got big because of his hygiene? Seriously? This sub...
---
Your spec doesn’t matter, pathfinder isn’t needed at all. Just keep her at range and auto shot, use your pet to trigger her to stop if you get too close.
---
Still not answering my question.
---
Personally, I'm open to it *only* if everyone in the group is required to have physically visited the location at least once, and it still needs to require at least two people already there.
---
Another idea I've floated is giving another class besides warlock a similar form of long distance utility ability.
---
Eg maybe mage can get a send portal that works reverse of warlock (so less useful but better flavor and not a clone of lock), or maybe druids can do something via the Emerald Dream.
---
No. I'm pretty on point.
---
He's getting into a suspiciously consistent amount of groups where people are randomly turning on master loot without any communication. That again I feel like I need to state, as someone who pugged through all pre raid bis, and 4 raid lockouts hasn't seen once, compared to twice in a day. 
---
His title is that he won't run with you if you ever turn on ML. Then has to clarify in his post that he doesn't actually think his title is accurate because it contradicts his own specific issue he's plagued with that apparently needed a PSA.
---
I am fully aware the OPs title is a complete failure of his post. I missed nothing.
---
I don't, but I will in a few minutes..... what a great idea!
---
Good on you I guess. I have only gotten close to that on an SM where I was overleveled, with the only Regen happening when swapping wings and even the we had adds at Cath doors that OOMed me.
---
Lvl 40, 3200mana unbuffed with hyper aggressive tanks that can't hold aggro, I will probably have to stop or someone dies and we have to stop anyway. 
---
With a good tank, holding aggro for the most part, I could get away with just drinking while tank starts a pull. To the party it would appear as if we never stopped because I never said 'stop, need mana.' but the effect is the same.
---
At my level and in my experience, more than passive mana Regen will be required.
---
Idgaf about your question
---
Yes. So think back to vanilla, a server had a population cap of x. Now, a LAYER has a population cap of x, and then the game creates a new layer until the set amount of layers are full this upper bound of total layers would be y. So when Blizzard talks about population caps in Classic, they are talking about the population cap being higher than vanilla ever was, they are getting this number because of the cap being multiplied by the number of layers that exist. They are simply saying x(y) &gt;x. So all they are saying to us is the layers are making may more people be on 1 server than ever was possible in vanilla.  That's all blizzard has outright stated is different. They havent said that the layer population caps are higher than vanilla or that when it'sreduced to 1 persistent server, that server population would be higher than vanillas. They have literally never said it, but people think its fact.
---
You can tank all the 5 man content in a standard fury spec with right gear no problem and that’s also good enough to off tank in MC.
---
I heard BGS is intense. A lot of people rave about that. I heard BFA sucks but a lot of people like it because BGS
---
What also factors into this though is with Travel Form I don’t get “dismounted” when running through mobs, so even if I am crossing a whole zone sometimes it’s faster.
---
Blocking negates most physical debufs as well, from bleeds and slows, to some stuns and incapacitates. Shield block also guarantees Anti-Crit and Anti-Crush for most warrior gearsets.
---
You can heal fine as shadow while leveling. The only note I will give though is to not bubble warrior tanks because it makes it harder for them to get rage when you do.
---
Thats some good weed
---
Honestly the gold should be a relative non factor. If someone feels that an item is worth a bag space, it’s better than vendoring the thing.  I know you mean well but IMO you are in the wrong on this.
---
Developer intent =/= Game Design. Even if the developers didn't intend the classes to work out the way they did...They didn't give the warrior the tools to be anything other than a Tank. What they wanted isn't what they made.
---
76g and a total noob??? At that level i have to sell my pants to pay for the flight to Hammerfall.
---
how?
---
does this mean you can use rage pots?
---
We got it. You see a dick. That’s what’s on your mind: cock.
---
Good on you I guess. I have only gotten close to that on an SM where I was overleveled, with the only Regen happening when swapping wings and even the, we had adds at Cath doors that OOMed me.
---

---
That's not at all accurate.  Even at low dungeons, renew is not enough for tanks.  You aren't a druid.  Look at your heals, try to be casting the most mana efficient spell you know.  This will typically be your highest heal spell
---
Ill count that as a yes.  
---
Just play retail, classic clearly isn't meant for you
---
Do not ever say something like this again.
---
On my server were raiding Hills brad with 3 other guilds and then heading to SW for the second time since release sunday.
---
I have been playing since release and did not know this. And I’ve been playing mostly a mage so it would have been super useful.
---
I'd get a kick out of seeing a Voidwalker named fart though.
---
Run ulda twice
---
keep yer ~~feet~~ hands on the ~~ground~~ belly
---
Still talking as if I would ever take advice from you. You sir are clearly braindead.
---
Ive given away countless blues and boosted people thru shit. This IS the spirit of classic. Keep paying it forward.
---
Good point! Thanks :)
---
Oof way to take a joke the wrong way. Fs for this guy.
---
I mean you either have some kind of punishment fetish or you want classic to be BFA.
---
Someone got triggered.
---
Again? Mate they never stopped
---
Well at the same rate they release content for retail WoW I'd say.
---
I don't give a fuck what "went to his head" bullshit you talk about, dude's good with his money, taking care of his parents and does a damn good job entertaining 50k+ viewers a day.
---
What the fuck are you doing?
---
Eh... If we assume that he has been playing since launch then him not being 60 yet means that he is far from being addicted. 
---
This is either an excuse from him or he has a controlling girlfriend who is not capable of accepting his hobbies.
---
I was level 42.95 at the time I finally had enough gold.
---
got to me too late, i fucked up , sold it for 550 gold
---
If you need money for the mount, farm the shellfish in desolace at night. Buy an underwater breathing pot and make about 20g/h or more if you are lucky with the greens.
---
I had a lvl 50 priest damn near full shadow tree heal a full BRD run easily.
---
Yes, the person who doesn't like ninjaing is the problem, not the ninja, that makes perfect sense.
---
Lmao yo I’m totally Aladdin in similar situations as well. Idk how you made the connection between the two but that gave me a good laugh lol
---
Highly recommend it! Grinding as my main is a chore for sober me. Drunk me gets to fuck around and chill on my drunk character who (thankfully) doesnt come out that often
---
Can confirm. I was in EPL and some people started saying LFM Borelgore right as I finished soloing it.
---
at least she is willing to try, God bless her.
---
So you think, its better to have shorter bossfights , around , lets say.. 20 seconds (because of more damage), than having battlerez, nice buffs, emergency heal and emergency offtank?
---
Well.
---
Okay then .
---
My server too. Any guilds recruiting ?
---
I want my demons to speak French
---
The rest of the game is great and I like talent trees. But the pvp is obviously broken, how hard is that to admit?
---
I have 13 days played and I'm level 57
---
&gt; I'm just a bit anxious about having to switch between weapons too much during combat.
---
This is a good way to piss off your healer.  You tank with a shield.
---
Bahaha right on
---
Warrior "First aid spec"
---
There could be several reasons:
---
1. DPS is the easiest to fill role. All nine classes can do it, and when someone posts "LF DPS" they are very likely to be overwhelmed with responses and not whisper everyone back. Not getting a response back is a common thing when responding to "LF DPS" posts as most classes in my experience.
---
2. As a hybrid class, there may already be other Druids in the group filling other roles and they don't want you along and competing for their gear. This is especially true of Feral Druid Tanks who are going to want a lot of the same gear as you. Even if it is just a Resto Druid healer who wants different gear than you do, you still lose most of your utility and the group would rather have something else. MotW and Thorns don't stack, and rarely do you ever need double Battle Rez or more than one Innervate in a 5 man group.
---
3. You lack any meaningful CC unless the dungeon is super beast heavy. Rogues have Sap, Mages have Sheep, Warlocks have Seduce/Voidwalker Off-Tank, etc. A lot of groups highly value CC on their DPS in dungeons and Feral has very little of that.
---
Overall DPS is an extremely easy to fill slot and groups can be extremely choosy about who they take. In general this means they won't want to double up on Druids if they already have one and they will want some CC with it. Don't be discouraged, people certainly know Feral Druids can DPS, that is just a very easy role to fill and therefore a very competetive one to get into.
---
I do think going into BM for the +armor is i.portant, but truly not necessary. Watching the videos will help you out the most.
---
When the voidwalker bout to bust a nut in his voidwalker wife but gets summoned a few seconds prior.
---
Classic pvp is a lot more cheesy and you need engineering and potions for it, on retail the only thing you need is skill since most pvp activity is balanced.
---
'Member when we would be getting world buffs and flasks and all this jazz from the pserver meta to raid MC.  I 'member XD
---
ive had nothing but problems with these kinds of groups and they often go slower than the traditional groups due to overpulling and not being good in general. if you get kicked for being the "wrong dps spec" as a mage, you probably didnt want to be in that group to begin with.
---
play your spec and enjoy.
---
I’m a pally, but still I was like yeah I can get two now! Looks like I’m only getting 1 for now
---
No ingame value? Imagine getting a free epic mount. Which cost gold
---
Earthfury
---
I played private servers for years, among literally thousands of other games, and while I have no wrist issues at all on the laptop keyboard side, the mouse hand is fucked.  Unless you have serious wrist issues already a laptop should not bring any added discomfort even after hours of use.  If you DO get this feeling when using laptop keyboard then you need to either see a doctor, or you need to figure out why you're crab gripping your laptop keyboard.
---
&gt; Deviation from the timeline that was established (in terms of events) doesn't seem likely because they would have to put real money into it rather than milk what's already been done.
---
Of course. But all that could have been written 5 years ago about Classic happening at all. That's my point: just because it's unlikely doesn't mean you can become all arrogant and drop "i GoT nEwS FOr YoU bUDdY" and just drop theories, even if they are solid theories.
---
We don't know, even if some theories are more likely than others.
---
&gt; You can effectively tank with a 2H for 90% of low level dungeons, and maybe only switch to 1H and Shield for bosses.
---
I disagree, I'm good at holding all the mobs and doing that shit with a 2H is rude to the healer.
---
Yeah that one takes a minute but at least we can do it. Unfortunately damn near everything else in plaguelands is immune :(
---
I never had to worry about an elite until I went there on my lock lol.
---
Except Mages when they cast Detect Magic on you, but they're Mages so you should be screwed as a Warrior regardless.
---
So lame they sold out
---
It is not. That is an old rumor that has no basis in reality.
---
saw 3 pairs on my AH for 500 gold each
---
&gt; it might be popular. But that doesn't make it lucrative
---
It literally does. Jesus Christ. Don't engage in adult conversation without a shred of understanding on such subject, buddy.
---
Thats should be a nobrainer.
---
Why... why don’t... 
---
print screen my man
---
Reddit seems determined to make the desktop experience worse IMO. Have to force it back to "old" reddit, use RES, and use css blocks just to make it as nice to use as it was five years ago. The redesign is everything wrong with modern webdev and fundamentally misses the point of Reddit.
---
Third party mobile apps are pretty good now, though usually don't have the full set of functionality
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Wups idk why I wrote slow, I meant fast obviously. Also your offhand does not proc SS on MH.
---
Why is he saying holy? Is clearly a mage only robe...
---
Use a voidwalker. There was some learning in the beginning but now I've done it so much I read during the kill. It's simple once you get he hang of it.
---
Because it plays fine on any decent laptop?  Also why are you talking about Super Mario Bros 2 in a WoW sub?
---
What do you mean, “at this point”?
---
If anything, spellcleave advertising groups are much more able to notice with the decade+ we’ve had now to get comfortable and learned about the nuances of the game. 
---
Yet I agree with your overall point: most groups won’t care. It would be a problem if the group is very high performing and expecting each mage to pull additional novas and IB’s, though.
---
Not only is cooking super important, but it helps make you some gold along the way as well.
---
And with a laptop like that she never never will be. Get her a real rig!
---
What is "server cap"? Are they increasing the amount of layers or the amount of people per layer? Server cap = (population total PER LAYER) x (number of layers). How are people deducing that because server cap was increased, when layering is removed we somehow have more people in the left over persistent world? That is what people are saying. It literally makes no sense, and when I point that out, people think I dont know what I'm talking about.
---
If I were to obtain a weapon like Ironfoe that already has greentext on it, will enchanting it replace the green text or is it possible for them to stack in that case?
---
wtf is acting? Hang on, you don't believe actors in movies and TV shows behave the same way irl, right?
---
Is this the type of people that hang around here? People unable to separate the real person from the personality they're acting as?
---
Agreed, the epic rams are fucking sweet
---
Blizzard outsmarted us. Simply delay phase 2 until all realms are on 1 layer
---
I’m sorry, but can you point out where in the original post that any “ninja’ing” occurred?  People greed rolled, one even passed.  You weren’t there, so why are you so personally invested in what that group did?  Not everything needs some white knight arguing why what happened was wrong because you don’t agree with it.
---
Okay sounds good then. Thanks
---
Well let me say even though he came off a bit snarky I would agree with him, they were items they could use, and you couldn’t so possibly making something from nothing , but when you run into this situation again and an epic bow drops I would roll need just Incase
---
r/UnexpectedSabaton
---
Wow fucking 9!? Get the hell out of here. I've found 1 in over 4 days played at 60.
---
Appeasing the fetishes I see. Very business minded
---
Don't do it, way too early, and it's shit spec anyways.
---
&gt; I’m sorry, but can you point out where in the original post that any “ninja’ing” occurred?
---
The mage literally needed just to make some gold. Like how does that demand an explanation?
---
I agree, I'll ask the guy who took it
---
Yes? It's also not just shorter boss fights, but also faster trash clears. If you need all that utility from your "dps" the run is doomed to begin with. 5 mans are easy, and I want to do them as quickly as possible. A feral dps does not achieve that goal for me.
---
Then you aren't in a groups with very good people tbh. I'm not hating on druid it's the only 60 I have, but when leveling a good mage or good warrior is going to stomp the amount of damage that you can do as a feral.
---
As soon as people will let you join BRD arena + gauntlet runs. Probably around 52. Personally I hate those runs, I would wait until 55 and start spamming LBRS and arena-&gt;anger-&gt;golemlord runs At around 58 you can do any dungeon
---
Shit you got good attention to detail haha i was like wtf for 30secs then i saw it hahaha
---
On a pvp server? Even without that’s impressive. I’ve had a handful of just unlucky respawns that end up with a lot of guys one me. 
---
And I guess try to solo a lot of elite quests since if they can be feared you can kill them a lot of the times
---
yikes
---
Cool table, creepy mousepads
---
Oh yeah, I should mention, visit Southshore before you start questing in Arathi intently, there's at least one quest chain that starts in Southshore but takes place mostly in Arathi
---
Not if you buy those blue gauntlets that are + in a bunch of different weapon skills.  Only works on bosses.
---
This is part of the reason it took me until 43.   I saw there was like 6g worth of Jungle Remedy on there selling for like 6s each, so I bought them all and reposted for 16s each.  Didn’t sell even one.
---
Then two nights ago I had the brilliant idea of going to Stranglethorn and selling them all in general chat right near the quest location.  I had one Paladin offer me 2gold for 7 because he was so fed up with the quest lol.
---
He's getting paid millions to have 100 people out of 50k call him a retard, yeah what a loser!
---
DM me with your email :D
---
Have patience and fun! Good luck
---
I get drunk every day
---
I mained warlock for a long time and there’s no sense in carrying that many shards all the time. Have maybe 6 and you’re fine. Like you said, you can always farm more on the spot.  If you use them often then it should be part of your rotation.
---
The alliance inn literally starts working as soon as you pass the mailbox.
---
Classic PvP is a mixed grab bag of people using every trick in the book and then some and all kinds of weird little ad-hoc stuff. BfA PvP tries to be balanced and eSports.
---
BfA also has rated matchmaking for arenas (and rated battlegrounds but they're barely on life support). Classic will always end up being a mixed bag.
---
Imagine typing out this comment thinking it contributes to the conversation
---
What guild was it’s ?
---
Cheers mate
---
Reeee I speedran through the content and need linear guided content. Reeee
---
Holy shit dude. Hate to be the one to tell you this, but that item isn’t in the game until AQ comes out. Hope you didn’t do too many runs for it.
---
She's not a gamer, I doubt this will last more than 20 mins then
---
*cries in 60% mount*
---
Classic is balanced for groups, not individuals.   
---
I don't have a hard time to believe that you struggle to find groups, but that does not mean that classic is unbalanced.   
---
It is an MMORPG, not an RPG like retail.
---
Sure, but that would definitely suck d less.
---
Imagine thinking there's a conversation.
---
Presumedly you would eat that healthstone while fighting an enemy that gives experience, which you can drain soul from for another shard...?
---
Do you believe Kaceytron's streaming personality is who she really is, too?
---
Next thing you'll tell me Mark Ruffalo actually has green skin and anger issues in real life...
---
Er ninjalooting iorden ja eller nej?
---
how does this comment not have a single upvote 7 hours later....I didn't realize this. Golden information
---
Exactly, soul shards mean it's less of a pain than most classes. I think the exception is war and they carry a sword and shield plus more repair costs for wearing heavy armor and getting smacked around.
---
Yarp, won't come out with the Silithus content.
---
Pve and PvP servers aren’t much different right now. It’s pretty passive on my server anyway. Phase two will bring the blood.
---
How much should i ask for opening different types of lockboxes?
---
I thought 1-125 = 5s, 175 = 10s, 225= 50s.
---
Is that fair or too much?
---
Sold mine on my realm for 4g 50s. Post your items on the weekends. More ppl online

No, the greedy thing would be to assume that because a Epic BoE drops that I can use, I'm entitled to the 300-600g it's worth. All needing a BoE is being fair to everyone.

I just don't think your average casual player plays 7 hours a day, but you have a point.

Your mok put you on that school for mentally handicapped children, that's why you spend your time talking to brainlets. Don't worry, you can't help it and we won't think less of you.

How do you make money with enchanting?   I can't give these god damn enchants away.  I spent 100g for crusader weeks ago, and thus far I've done 1 crusader enchant and made like 3g.
---
I don't like him because he encourages a lot of poor gameplay that I end up seeing when I play. I know everyone has their right to enjoy the game how they see fit, but I just wish this were a little closer to the real vanilla experience.
---
I compare his stream to that of a reality TV show. You're basically watching a dramatic, emotion-fueled show. Asmon saying something, McConnell whining like a baby, getting whispers that "so and so guildmate did bad thing", holding live guildmate trials. It's literally just reality TV in stream form. And any new, big moment on the steam becomes the new meme for his followers to rally behind.
---
Beyond that, I believe he assists in the popularity of me-over-party and race-to-the-finish type attitudes. Examples are things like AoEing super fast through dungeons, only clearing bosses through the one you need, etc.
---
you just need to subscribe to the right sub redits.
---
Most people just do tips or a flat 10s. Your proposed rates are pretty much equal to the value of item you'll find in the box.

I'm not surprised since they don't believe acting is a thing. Ryan Reynolds is a real mutant who kills a bunch of bad guys, they believe that's real lmao.

I used to love the transporter malfunctions through engineering. The Area 52 (?) one could change your race. 
---
The issue is I'm a shaman. Any time I would ghost wolf it would clear all these fun debuffs.
---
Should edit your video to cut out your toxicity at the end.

With a 14% drop rate you have a 2.3% chance of not getting it after 25 runs.  That's not even crazy low

Clapclapclap!

His main demographic are 25-35 year olds.
---
I just want neatplates to work in instances again
---
If my pet attacks faster, that means more chances at a crit, more crits = more DMG. Though to be fair the difference is extremely minimal, and having a wolf would be a much larger increase in DMG to a raid.

How is this in any sense ninja looting? The hunter is even passing on it for the mage.. What makes this exact situation ninja looting?
---
Wait until they go ahead with TBC so you can get the skill point in Tailoring mate.
---
I just won't loot if people are around. They can just watch it despawn.
---
Crater is a lawless land but they are definitely pieces of shit. However it is blizzard responsibility to prevent people from being dicks like this, unfortunately they never did in vanilla and people are too stuck in the old ways to realize that fixing it would just be a straight up improvement to the game.
---
Almost had a warlock roll need on the Second Wind I was farming for. People need to fucking read, I spent hours trying to get that damn trinket to drop.
---
I am
---
Eh not surprising really. I am at somewhere around 15 runs of UBRS without seeing Valor shoulders which are apparently \~20% drop chance.
---
Just bad RNG.

Right it's good because it has armor and stamina, it's not as good as blues. It's not better for feral, it's better for resto. Can you stop now

No it shouldn't but it is and there's nothing any of us can do about it.

I respect that dedication.. I always get consumed with the "I've got at least at 50/50"

And now for a life of buffing and healing

They better not, lol. Had to reroll on a few servers because I really dislike the presence that big streamers bring to servers
---
Dude you are wrong give it up.
---
Fuck.
---
Hvorfor vil du ikke svare?
---
Men synes du ikke det er en smule ironisk du bliver ved med at kalde mig dum, men du kan ikke se hvordan det er ninjalooting at neede på et item kun for pengenes skyld.

Lol by shit behaviour do you mean videos that annoy you?

Ya just dont loot it lol. Really piss em off
---
classic pvp is heavily rng based. Fights are over in seconds if one party gets lucky with their crits and there's not much counterplay.
---
On the plus side most classes are very simple but there is quite a bit of depth if you want to look further into consumables like engineering trinkets, limited use items and potions.
---
BfA is more "sanitised" pvp, every class basically has the same tools as every other class (interrupts, gap closer, gap opener, stun, etc etc) and unless you're out in the open world most items are banned from instanced pvp. 
---
There is an art to BfA pvp still, it requires a lot of setup and knowledge of your opponents abilities and when they're vulnerable.
---
This is correct
---
They we're cheap as shit and so common on Skullcrusher.  Some guildies made fun of me, they didn't believe me when I said they were the best DPS gloves in the game.
---
depends on your realm. check the ah
---
Both behaviors are toxic
---
What you get for aoe threat is something invaluable and that is Thorns.
---
With thorns or fire shield from imp on a warrior, you're impossible to take aggro off.
---
Also, thunderclap doesn't really deal a lot of threat. I don't think you understand threat management either.
---
Actually it's "Don't encourage the asshole. And just because someone else will do it, doesn't mean we should do it for money"
---
I swear these murlocs have a higher chance than other mobs to drop Boe purples. I got one there too and saw a few other posts that also got Epics from them as well

---
Seriously, that's insane.
---
It goes for 5-15s each on my server going by the last two weeks (it varies)
---
It is a 1/9 chance or 11%. He will drop one of the helms each run so which one it would be is all luck. Reading old comments, back in vanilla and tbc, people were running 50+ times to get it to drop.
---
Edit: [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=1853#drop](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=1853#drop)
---
More accurate drops rates here, WoWhead only has a 311 sample size.
---
Lucky you! Im so jealous!
---
SSD is a couple years old now so it's probably on its way out. but i'll do a full diagnostic when I have time.
---
How much time do you have?
---
&gt;mostly tends to be the category women fall back on.
---
Such shit you spew, it reeks
---
I sincerely dont mean to sound rude or anything, but "average for you" isnt a good way to gauge an objective "average". 
---
I mean do what you want and I fully support putting countless hours into this game. But I mean i'm only at 53 and I would still consider myself far above average with how many hours i put into this game.
---
When I consider average I consider my good buddy who plays quite regularly, but is only lvl 37. He plays alot, but not a shit tonne. That's probably more representative of your "average gamer". WoW skews this because soo many people take this game to the max, so the theoretical "average gamer" seems to be someone who plays 5+ hours a day every day on average (or more?), which is objectively ALOT to play for any game.
---
Any idea how to get that pet action bar on the MC cap working? I would be eternally grateful to your knowledge
---
Hunters must store the ammunition in a proper bag, otherwise it doesn’t work.
---
This is a gold transfer
---
You're just justifying ninja looting a pattern you need
---
Same. My wife plays a hunter and she lives the stereotype to the fullest: NEED ON EVERYTHING
---
If 2s was a thing warrior/troll priest would be pretty nutty lol
---
How do you know it is to make cash? The robe is Bind on pickup when you make it. It's mage only. He's a mage.
---
The most obvious thing would be using it, and besides.. It's not a super expensive pattern.
---
I think you've made up in your mind that he is ninjaing already, without knowing any of the factors.
---
Imagine thinking seeing poor gameplay is in any way related to asmongold.
---
This literally happened to me and the guy gave me a whole stack to fuck off
---
I feel like this was someone masterlooting jed
---
You mean Moonglade. Common mistake.
---
Oh word I was idiot and wasn’t thinking lmao I deserved those downvotes. I’d be for that system but I can imagine some people griefing by way of need on high gold items.

---
Yet people still manage to living bomb the raid
---
So jelly you and your wife play wow. Congrats 🎉
---
&gt; How do you know it is to make cash?
---
Because that's literally the only way to use the pattern, either he sells it for the cash OR he actually uses it saving the money he would have spent on buying it, which again is needing for the money.
---
&gt; and besides.. It's not an expensive pattern.
---
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware there was a line drawn where ninjaing is acceptable.
---
&gt; I think you've made up in your mind that he is ninjaing already, without knowing any of the factors.
---
What factor am I forgetting about?
---
judging from that mouse you're a dirty clicker
---
Please please please
---
i have a stoned character I always play, but it's my main, and i'm pretty much always high when I play. ironically enough his name is drunkpunk. i just get too anxious sitting still when I'm drinking to play video games unfortunately.
---
This doesn't look like a screenshot from WoW, this looks like a piece of art that someone painted. I've made up my mind, this is art now.
---
225 boxes usually contain more expensive stuff. One guy asked me to open him three 225 boxes for 50s each, and he was happy with the loot he got. One guy on my server even buys 225 lockboxes for 2g with C.O.D, meaning he expects to make more than 2g from each box.

Seems that this auction will end in a bid! Or not..

---
Okay, men er du så ikke sød at hjælpe mig med at blive klogere, for jeg er faktisk blevet meget i tvivl efter at have deltaget i denne tråd.
---
Because the massive 28% dw miss chance only applies to autos. Special (yellow) attacks use 9%.
---
So which do you think is better, getting crit/ap to increase overall dps or getting extra hit to slightly increase auto attack dps?
---
Yes, they should be allowed.
---
Hmm not really. It's your group, so build it bow you please. Would you rather them ninja it after you put the work in?
---
Usually it's the other way around on those subs
---
Not poor gameplay in general. It was a bad choice of words. I more mean that I see the ways he does things on stream creeping into the ways some people seem to want to play the game now.
---
It's definitely subjective because it's not my preferred play style. My preferred play would match that of 15 years ago, which obviously Asmon is not doing.
---
Also use Necrosis but I havent configure it to handle shards. The macro and soul bag as well as good inv management and route planning haven't left me wanting anything.

Is this your first MMO?

Mate. You need to understand the volume that botters/RMTers go through. 
---
When I was bottling throughout WOTLK into MOP, I would move hundreds of thousands of gold every fortnite to random burner accounts. 
---
Given classic will have a lower arbitrary amount, the relative movement of even your friends giving you everything they own - all of their stuff - wouldn’t even be enough for blizz to waste even a second getting an agent to look into it.

I'm all for a gradual pace of content release, we all have more obligations and responsibilities 15 years later, but god damn give us the BGs.
---
Some people are pvp fiends but without 5+ hours a day to play, its not practical to roll on a pvp server.
---
Some of my fondest memories are from world PVP in beta, and my MMO history started with Dark Age of  Camelot which end game is pretty much PVP, 3 realms at war, and then after that Shadowbane which was the most hardcore pvp MMO, where there literally was no trainers or villages, it was up to player guilds to create them, and battle for resources etc.
---
But 15 years later and aint nobody got time to spend 30% of overall game time on corpse runs. Thats a serious hit to /played 60.
---
Im on a PVE server but thirst for PVP
---
As Hunter I throw in an intimidation, and a serpent sting if I pass someone who seem like they need it
---
Tried to 2v1 valiantly.
---
Depends on his path to 40. I was 20 gold short when I dinged 40 and I hadn't purchased anything outside of repairs, spells (not all but a couple more than required) and flights. I chose to level from 28 to 40 in SM and didnt quest, never got any good drops so the gold wasnt very good.
---
Went the whole day without knowing. All the missed karma :/
---
What are you talking about? Killing Tinkerer/Rotgrip will get you locked way too quick. My disc priest with PI managed to get 700g over 4 days of farming killing only tinkerer/princess as disc protests cannot kill Rotgrip.
---
Killing Princess is absolutely worth it. And mining is extremely worth it. I have over 200 sappers from only farming mara.
---
i don't watch him because i don't find him entertaining  for myself... but i can understand that some junger kids  are having fun watching his act  and  being part of his community  since the events  and server seems to be quite a fun bloodbath..
---
i don't like him , but i think its nice  that people that enjoy it have the chance to play on a server with him and go nuts... saw some  raid vs raid clips  and it looked fun  even if i don't like the guy

i see no reason to hate on the guy everyone should be allowed to have fun, even if its not my way ;)

This was an impressive breakdown of classic vs retail
---
In principle I suppose.
---
I personally go through 5-8 shards pretty quickly right at the start of a group. With good inventory management I haven't found myself in dire need of a normal bag for the fourth slot. It's nice to have a stack of them and not have to farm for them ever.

Yup. Just got booted from my 2nd attempt at uldaman. Ugh.

It’s definitely a really nice bonus to have. It’s hard to say if it’s worth dropping tailoring for another profession. My plan is to go Tailoring/Engineering
---
Ive always thought it was super dumb that you don't get a skinning tag for 30s or something in addition to the regular tag.
---
Same for me, the game lagged wouldn't let you do anything. Chat channels still worked; then the server crashed and is now offline.
---
I convinced my two brothers in law to play.  We have three dwarves, warrior, hunter and priest named after scotch distilleries.
---
Yeah.  We’re playing drunk.
---
YUP
---
Ikke underligt du har haft en depression, du er spild af luft.
---
Your a bad.  I’d prefer to ignore you all together actually.
---
Also bears have bullshit threat mechanics with bear form giving them a 75% more threat modifier on top of swipe/maul having their own 75% more threat modifier
---
Also swipe costs 15-20 rage, is instant, does not block rage gen, and hits 3 targets.
---
But cleave costs 20, comes out slower, blocks rage gen, and only hits 2 targets
---
Also Bears are largely gear agnostic---If it has stamina and armor, it'll get you through the dungeon---and they ignore weapon skill, their tanking talents are nearly identical to their leveling talents, and they get all their survivability baseline without needing to dump rage for it and at level 40 all their pre-existing gear is instantly upgraded to the next armor class.
---
But warriors need to make sure their gear is recent, their weapon is fast but not too weak, their weapon skill is appropriately leveled for it, their baseline survivability is lower and only beats Bears by spending rage, their tanking talents are entirely separate from their leveling talents, and at 40 they're forced to choose between keeping good mail gear or trading it in for plate gear with shittier stats but better armor.
---
So bears end up being more flexible, more fluid, more responsive, and just overall better until raids where warriors win out strictly because of crushing blows and better availability of the defense stat on plate than on leather.
---
Putting your children's faces everywhere and even on such irrelevant things such as mousepads to constantly rub their faces with mouse? Seriously. Do you put random photos of your children in random amounts on mugs? Toilet paper holders? On foot carpet, to constantly wipe your shoes on their faces?
---
No. Because that's plain dumb. Not mentioning that it looks awful.
---
These are the same types of people who use their own photos as screensavers.
---
Please take off the stickers of the laptop :C
---
I am Thassimar.
---
yeah it crashed
---
That is strange
---
What am i missing here?
---
I believe it's a banable offence. Last I saw it broke the ToS regarding in game verbal harassment between factions.
---
Back online, but disconnected right away when I got to character select screen
---
Edit: Frozen on load screen now
---
Edit 2: Back in, seems to be fine just a hiccup
---
Edit 3: Back offline after 10 minutes
---
Edit 4: Back online 3 minutes later
---
nice post OP
---
But... the real motive of getting her to pay will he lost.
---
that’s pretty badass lol
---
lol Vanilla large scale world pvp basically = Mages aoeing.
---
It's fairly simple, a group with a feral dps means another group without a feral tank
---
Most of the min maxxing nax advise videos I've seen have 1 warlock.... So I think all these people calling shadow priest a good idea are going to be in for a ride awakening. Staking a shit ton of warriors, mages and rogues has obviously been proven a better strategy at this point. Honestly don't understand anyone wanting to do end game PvE DPS who didn't choose one of those classes.
---
Perfect timing for you then! No que times. It’s back online
---
multiboxers = more money. soo...
---
It’s really not as hard as your making it out to be. Just play the game, quest during the mornings and do dungeons at night. It’s working out for me and usually at the end of the day I AH surf and buy or mailing greens and mats to my alts. Think about it like if you re roll you’re starting all the way over and the halfway mark is at about 45.
---
Also loot and spots as a tank in raid will not be hard to get. You’re assuming wrong, it’s fairly easy nowadays with how many players it is to pug dungeons or find a good guild who needs you as a high level tank
---
A mage or rogue sounds like a good choice for you based on what you want
---
&gt; Or they're just nice people who are like, cool he can use it.
---
Everyone in the group could use it, so that doesn't make any sense. But even if that wasn't the case, he should have greeded because that's why he rolled on it, greed, not need.
---
&gt; We're not all greedy poor people like you, sorry to break your bleak worldview.
---
Yes, the person who doesn't agree with screwing over 4 other people purely to make a bit of cash is greedy, that makes perfect sense.
---
The funniest/most face palm thing is seeing a warrior say "lfm tank BRD arena anger HoJ and Savage reserved" in LFG.
---
This is why the mafia/cartel was created originally. Letting the lowest MS guy win isn't fun. PvP is fun.
---
Then why didn't that other person(whoever that is, in your mind?) roll need too? Why are you being so willfully obtuse?
---
You're not seeking any discussion at all, so goodbye.
---
So jelly! But in a happy for you way! Grats!
---
https://github.com/jaredb7/MoveAnything
---
A classic fork for MoveAnything, don't play classic myself but it may work for you =)
---
No streamers. Blizz seriously needs to fix their infrastructure.
---
That last point though 👌🏻
---
I went from 10g at 32 to 114 at 40 spamming SM going back to sell every time my bags were full. I only auctioned mageweave and silk everything else was vendored even greens.
---
Maybe you didn't, but a ton of people did. Enough that 15 years later we are having this conversation.
---
They don't even sell well. (At least on my server.)
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Any relation between your toon's name and Star Wars by chance? I know its spelled differently but looks like it'd be pronounced the same as Admiral Thrawn's Noghri assassin. Just curious. :)
---
20+ hours when I did it on private servers..... for over a month and a half... AND THAT WAS FOR RANK 11-13 PUSH.
---
Pay it forward! :)
---
Glad to know you knock out 1 layer. World PvP is trash right now because of layers. But you do you on “ your server”
---
Why are they doing it this way?
---
Whatever floats your boat
---
80% of this community plays gnome it seems. Never thought there'd be so many. Grats on your mount
---
6 hours a day of gaming. Bro. That is straight no lifing. 6 hours a day every day (on average) is more than a full time job.
---
If someone told me they worked 80 hours a week, I'd say they probably don't have much of a life outside of that.
---
Again, their choice but not even close to being common. Even for folks who game as a hobby.
---
That's gone from hobby to full on major part of your life.
---
I just got the gnomish mind control cap and also have the same problem. Have you found any solution? And does /petattack really work even without the bar, even if you don't know what abilities they have? I also don't have any UI/action bar addons that could interfere. Idk if it matters, but I'm a lock. I tried dismissing my pet before using the cap but it didn't make a difference
---
&gt; Then why didn't that other person roll need too? Why are you being so willfully obtuse?
---
Because they were doing as this subreddit has been telling them for weeks now and rolling greed when all you want an item for is money.
---
&gt; (whoever that is, in your mind?)
---
How do you know they didn't? Only one we see passing is the hunter, the rest could have greeded as they were supposed to.
---
&gt; You're not seeking any discussion at all, so goodbye.
---
Yet I'm responding to everything you've said.
---
You ... have never been a Warlock.
---
Walk with the earthmother.....
---
I would kill for the pinwheel hat mini void walker
---
you mean just trade fast wins, because you can only farm cp out of an individual 10 times a day, so after the 10th kill there's no point anymore, and what you want is the bg win
---
if you dodge you risk longer queues
---
of course if you're good, you can just farm everyone
---
need a dps ? ;)
---
Blue eyes.
---
That's great! My wife started playing along with me around Cata and we have been playing together ever since. She used to sneak peeks as I was playing for years but never really said she was interested until then.  I always told her she missed the best of WoW in Wrath.
---
We now have abandoned retail and play Classic 100%.
---
This. So much this.
---
*I put on my wizard hat and robe
---
No need to worry, seems good to me
---
I concur, some of the most fun pvp situations were in the world. 
---
One time I was doing the chicken escort quest in tanaris and an ally warrior and pally (about 3 levels higher than me each) tried to gank me. Was able to fear both of them away from my escort while my pet tanked the NPC mobs, got far enough away from the quest to fully pvp and killed the warrior. The pally then killed me. HOWEVER, I immediately ss’d when the pally was unsuspecting and ran back to my escort to find it’s still alive. Summoned the VW and completed the same escort quest. Nailed it.
---
Easy choice, reroll Horde and get an undead one
---
Yeah but NEs are ghey
---
Mage, Rogue, Warrior, and Paladin are all ones I'm leaning towards.  
---
Paladin not so much, because I only really enjoy healing on Resto Druid. :/  I'd want to tank or DPS, but they are not so hot at that.
---
Ive decided to go with Brown. Mainly for the purple eyes.
---
It is garbage.
---
Day, month, year. It just makes sense. It's logical.
---
Wtf did you eat it all at once?
---
He needs to find a new girlfriend. Anyone THAT controlling is going to have boundary issues by far later.
---
Oh quit your hobby (he's level 52, he's not playing that much), then you can't hang out with certain guy friends anymore, than you can't have female friends, then nobody but her.
---
Yeah, it's a sign, drop her.
---
If someone really thinks you have an issue, they would tell you to see a **PROFESSIONAL**, not just outright choose them or something else.
---
yeah of course why wouldn’t i
---
Multiboxing has never seemed to significantly impact the pvp seen or the economy. You could have, I know I have, met a couple mages in a party doing the same thing.
---
I think the real issue here was that person being a jerk, as you've told the story.
---
Comparing looking at an image to eating food haha 🤡
---
lmao I bet someone somewhere will get actually offended by this one day and blizzard will modify the name "race" to something else. I'm sure a third "neither" gender will be listed as well. 
---
Thanks left.
---
Did you misread that?  Or just fanboy out and stop reading any criticism?
---
He overran the YouTube videos.  Before he started making classic content other videos made it to YouTube and got promoted.  Then he joined the crew and it's just always his.  I'll click another Creator and then the next video is YouTube saying "oh everyone else is watching this dickwad" and I have to leave and search for real content.  He pops up everywhere and he's obnoxious.  I stopped watching any YouTube content for Classic, because he ruined it.
---
I like how you think that everyone who plays WoW is on reddit too. Maybe you should move off reddit? Again, you don't seek any discussion, because you have the most backwards view on things.
---
How is that having a discussion? This is more an argument, if you need more distinct, you dolt.
---
The fact that some people think it is VC means nothing.
---
Some people are Scientologists. Some people don't believe in climate change. Some people are holocaust deniers.
---
The fact that those people exist does not mean that those views are accurate.
---
I didnt downvote you, was just sharing a fact with you in case you didnt know.
---
On my realm it’s fair game really. Most people aren’t contesting them per day and you’ll occasionally get the alliance (or horde) waiting to gank you after you loot and then take your skinning lol. I’ve also asked a random /who “hey wanna help me kill this devilsaur?” And he goes “sure”. So we proceed to kill 3 and I skin them and ended up giving him 1 cause without him I couldn’t have done it. I am only lvl like 51-52.
---
Oblivious wonder....
---
left?
---
As a 52 with nearly 9 /played, it’s pretty reasonable.
---
"I can shooow you the world...of Warcraft!"
---
Priscilla go back to candycrush, this topic is beyond your understanding
---
Lol, Storm, the entire server knows that you are mafia.  Downvote all you want but the word is out.
---
This happened to me in Vanilla. Needed 50g for my fast mount and some guy just gave it to me.  It was nice as I was ready to sell a kidney for it.
---
I see horde there on the char selection screen which could be chance. Can she choose from the prettier side as well since no blood elves yet?
---
damn, you must be fun at parties
---
Best pve and PvP caster race alliance side.
---
What video did you watch little guy? I counted 8 mages.
---
2-3x 2-3 sure.
---
Vicious.  WTS hand jibbers SW fountain...
---
Must be a yank thing I guess.
---
Someone Photoshop voidwalker with tie and hat pls
---
i keep gettin dc'ed
---
This is the most annoying quest. It makes you go back and forth into Uldaman a bunch of times and you’re constantly picking up this item again. Either you destroy it in your bags each time you pick it up or you don’t and instead leave loot sparkles all over the instance.
---
It's dictionary.com suitable for anyone unlike what you provided. You have convoluted this issue so much at this point you are more just attacking my ideas instead of actually providing any logical viewpoint....
---
Salt the snail!! Why do you make people do this to you Gail!?
---
Booted again. Must be another ddos
---
Is there any way to emulate endgame warrior builds and test their dps? Like private servers that do that maybe, or a program I can download to simulate the actual game?
---
&gt;  because you have the most backwards view on things.
---
"Please don't ninja loot" is a backwards view on things?
---
Also experiencing HEAVY rain and fog in STV... never seen it like this?
---
I feel like I'm the only one on the internet that doesn't give a fuck about photos of screens.
---
People could, at any time, decide to roleplay one day. Having them auto muted because they don't have the same add-on seems counter productive
---
I know you're most likely just meming to hate on Asmon, but that is very untrue. I have an alt in one of the Olympus guilds and it's more active than most random guilds i've joined before. I've seen quite a few people drop guilds to switch over because it is more active than their current guild.
---
i feel like people saying that you “only need 2-3 shards” have never ever played a Warlock. all of our abilities come from shards. people think that when soloing we just use the VW and that’s it. i drain tank with my Fellhunter, whenever i die i need to use 3 shards right away to replace my SS my HS and my pet (drain tanking requires me to constantly use my hearthstone) and *IF* i die as a warlock soloing, it means i’m doing a quest that is like 4 levels higher than me and getting a shard from a mob 4-5 lvls higher isn’t easy nor fast.
---
Anyone here on Ashkandi Horde that can tell me about their experience on the server as far as faction balance is concerned and if it has a good community?
---
Snagged my old nostalgic shaman name there on a lark whereas every name in the existence of man is taken on Mankrik.
---
uh oh it just got kicked off again lol
---
The fuck are you on about?  It was literally ninja looted.
---
I don't usually get feral druids whispering me for spots when I advertise the positions... But would definitely take one for the utility! The same as taking a ret Pally imo, great buffs/off heals/off tank and rezzing!
---
Wow they 1.9g a stack in my realm
---
You're trying to spread negativity over a fucking mouse pad, just think about that for a second. Whether or not you think it's stupid there's no reason to be a dick about it. 
---
Great video. It's almost as though video games are a language that you can learn.
---
Ya way too many people care about this shit.
---
Ok tyvm
---
Yea, right. I'm sure this isn't faked...
---
&gt;  but the outrage and behavior you describe are intentional and fake, for deliverys sake and hyperbole.
---
He behaved largely the same before he got big.
---
Its more accurate to say he exaggerates his natural behavior.
---
He died a death worthy of any warrior.
---
We should all be so lucky to go so bravely.
---
Damn, my bad I forgot this was hunter loot. Now my day is ruined
---
Same. Watched him once when beta first dropped and had to mute it after 5 min
---
Shit take bruh.
---
1.69g on my server. I farmed maybe 190 of those today in 3-4 hours.. boring.
---
Location, lack of quests, lack of decent drops (there's a few but not really worth), length, amount of trash, and not very rewarding.
---
Honestly right now it’s whatever value you wanna make it (realistically) but hold off til bgs if you can
---
Buying GF 10gp
---
My sincere apologies for having an opinion.
---
No, it's loot for no particular person at all, yet the mage needed on it, how is that not ninja looting?
---
&gt; Buy cheap greens to DE and sell the materials.
---
Sphh,  I de'd my greens while leveling.  Then I looked at AH, and I would have been better off vendoring them, and buying mats off AH.
---
He's not doing YouTube anymore you squid. Other people are ripping videos from his steam and uploading it to YouTube.
---
Just shot you a PM on here - thank ya
---
yeah same, its not lookin good :P
---
most of them, even!
---
Too bad you reading comprehension is shot.
---
No, it's literally a pile of cash.
---
Yeah fuckhead.  I said AsmonClip channels.  I know how it works.  But it's his huge base and all the shits like you watching it that promote them all
---
People don't just rip random channels and get to YouTubes next video slots.  It comes from people with a huge fan base.  And that's what I said.
---
I don't get why he has a huge fan base. But talking to you, I see people are dumber that I generally give them credit for.
---
Krik
---
Technically, but pretty inefficient
---
Species *would* make more sense. Your name checks out though
---
Why is it worth it? What to do with the items? Vendor?
---
&gt;For the most part, a shitty person is going to be a shitty person no matter what. 
---
I would disagree. Quite a lot of people just conform to those around them. 
---
You can see this in pugs. Eveyone behaves until one guy does something bad and then everything is chaos.
---
My server is one layer after the recent patch. 
---
And just because your server is ass, or your guild is ass doesnt mean everyone's is. My guild isnt waiting for honor, thats what a filthy casual would say.
---
Oh whoops, you're blind. My bad, I didn't know you lacked the ability to read.
---
Hey now, play nice you two.
---
What server?! This is the best one to start on.
---
Name 1 other reason to need on it than money.
---
Top Tier solo farming class, access to gold farms non-pet classes can even attempt. Princess Runs anyone?
---
Back to balanced..
---
I was hoping to see the kid with the propeller hat
---
I do. I only read reddit when Im out for a smoke or taking a shit.
---
Hunter macro question: Is there a macro that'll allow me to cast Wing Clip and Disengage both at the exact same time?
---
Why's that? They are looking for a feral tank pretty much. No problem with that.
---
Masochist
---
Tailoring
---
Damn I’m jelly. I’m not even 40 to get my first mount.
---
So is the priest played by a disgruntled former Olympus member who is just trying to get revenge for guild-related shenanigans?
---
Or is it just some dude who likes to fuck with this guy because he's an idiot?
---
Saw a 40-man multiboxer earlier today, all around level 25. That's $600/month in blizzard's pockets. Not going anywhere.
---
He's not a ninja lol. He has told his guild mulitple times to NOT ninja. And he has not ninja'd anything in classic. Anyone who thinks he is a ninja doesn't understand how gearing works in classic. 
---
If people in his guild do ninja then he deals with them.
---
I think those things are generally good relationship advice.
---
Like how Mage’s are piss easy compared to other classes
---
On mobs that requires a pull with ranged weapons for los how would you start since you can't build up rage from charge? I struggle on pull where I can't charge in
---
What Add-on are you using  for the target health bars?
---
Imagine thinking Jaden Smith isn’t a visionary genius.
---
I've always thought it was Kirk, but now I'm not certain enough to dispute it and I'm certainly too lazy to google it. We shall call it a draw!
---
lmao so true for me right now
---
Oooooo you killed a priest, holy cow!!!
---
&gt; Killing Princess is absolutely worth it.
---
It's takes 5-8 minutes depending on RNG and yields less than 3g on average, that's 30 gph if you're being optimistic, fucking aweful.
---
Not as much as they hate China
---
Keep making us look good and that should help. Having said that, I have to agree about the gear. You have a lot of classes wanting your loot.
---
If they want to use it for tailoring, and don't care about the money why haven't they bought it then?
---
Totally for fun! But I love watching streamers to see whats going on in WoW. Theres so many awesome streamers that have big fanbases and have a professional attitude. By “professional” I mean act maturely - they act like role models for WoW. If more streamers advocated good attitudes it will make the player-base better!
---
I play a frost mage and caught a skulled warrior out with Rez sickness, it was the highlight of my day lmao.
---
I don't really struggle a lot with that, I only keep 4-5 shards in my inventory at any given time.
---
I did 2h til the later part of cath and was top damage by a massive amount as the tank pretty much the whole time. 
---
I would ask the healer if they wanted to go fast or slow and almost all of them both wanted to go fast (2h) and complimented me on aggro management. I made sure to watch their mana and get a mage in party. 
---
The end of cath and some bosses hit pretty hard so I would shield for that. Honestly using a slow 1h would have probably been decent damage also.
---
Gnome mounts are by far the worst looking 😭
---
He's a hunter, he jumped down (probably) and now his pet is running to himto catch up (they don't jump, they follow terrain like regular mobs) and aggroing every mob it runs past. 
---
He's hearthing out of the dungeon just as you see his pet in the background dragging all the mobs to him.
---
If he would've been a few seconds slower on his hearthstone, all those mobs would have wrecked his pet and then him in seconds. 
---
He could also Feign Death, but we are trying to laugh here, not be elitists lol
---
But the drop rates are independent events.
---
I fixed the problem by restarting my computer. Still not sure what that was all about lol
---
I had around that much at that level. I had just enough at 40 to get my mount with 1g to spare with the faction discounts.
---
I'm only level 35 at the moment, but how important is BiS farming at 60 for MC/Ony really? It seems like both can be cleared handily with basic dungeons blues. Unless I've misinterpreted the ease in which these raids are being cleared.
---
I respectfully disagree, if Blizzard starts stepping in to police these situations we lose the freedom that makes this game great in the first place. Deal with it yourself and If you can't handle the crater then go farm Black Lotus or something. Tons of lucrative hustles out there...
---
Yea getting 10 of each essence took a little while, water was a pain the others were not too bad, getting pattern is a pain if you are not lucky so I paid 200g for it on AH.
---
This is really weird.
---
I'm still trying to convince mine - she's a gamer but she's quite afraid of WoW.
---
Yep. Very pathetic to hate on someone bigger than you, especially when their reasons are not valid. 
---
Most of the reasons people "hate" asmon is because he is "dirty" or "bad" or they have never watched him. They may have seen 1 video out of context and now its "OH I HATE THIS GUY SO MUCH"
---
Man, if they actually watched him for a stream or two, maybe they would realize they don't hate him. Happens to people all the time.
---
Phase 2 will be a bloodbath for the 50+ zones when honor comes into play. Should be fun.
---
Just hit lvl 39 last night. I have 95 gold. I’ve been preparing for this moment since like lvl 25 lol
---
Lol. Asmongold get fukt
---
Seems like you were trying to fit a paladin into a warrior's role that whole time and not enjoying it. Some people like paladins for their unique support style role.
---
Ya dweeb
---
Yep, plus you can equip the Robe of Winter Night at level 52 instead of 57 for the Robe of the Void. It certainly would be helpful to have it during those levels.
---
Within the population of "people who play WoW Classic" it's probably not as rare as you think. After all, a good chunk of the playerbase is 60. It's really not that unusual for single people to have 4-5 hours free on weekdays and 10+ hrs on weekends to do whatever they want.
---
That's almost exactly what I was thinking, I love nature's grasp too much, and the mana saved when shifting. Not a big fan or wrath. But that might change when pvp comes out.
---
at the same time , no, theres global cooldown's involved. you can do one after the other , fairly simply
---
/cast wing clip  
---
/cast disengage
---
You'd have to ask them.
---
Approximately a fuckton.
---
I'd say about tree fiddy.
---
I just put anyone reserving an item on ignore whenever I notice in chat.

This guy is even more pathetic than people who follow asmongold around. And holy shit his goddamn voice is so annoying.
---
Lots. Depending on the server.
---
So, basically you can't see any other reason than money to roll on it, yet you don't see how that's ninja looting?
---
Quite a lot. Those are pretty expensive over here.
---
spelling edit
---
And if you do it roght you can usually get more than 1.5 levels out of full rest because quest exp isn't doubled. Just mob kills.
---
Arzt?

That a healthy amount. You have a high food tolerance, if I ate that shit I’d be dying.
---
Yeah I know I'm just very impressed by how forthright you are.
---
Edit: in vanilla BOEs were needed by people who would use them, and greeded otherwise. Anything else was shady, at least on my server. So are you saying you would need on a boe that is a clear upgrade for someone in your group? Do they not "need" it? If your justification is that everyone "needs gold," (which is among the dumbest arguments I have ever encountered), then why is there a need/greed system at all?
---
My first character was a NE solely because of how awesome darnassus and the surrounding areas looked in all of the alpha and beta screenshots.
---
Love poppin alliance ninjas like the pimples they are. Nice vid man!
---
FYI this is a bug with Classic, not how it worked in 1.12, and will be fixed eventually.
---
supah mare-ee-o 2
---
Shit dude take a chill pill and go for a walk.
---
The main place thia isnt true is Blackrock Mountain. Too tempting to PvP there.
---
No but spy pairs really well with character notes add-on. If you can't find it on twitch download from curseforge website and twitch will detect and keep it updated for you.
---
But they obviously aren't going to use it like that or they would have bought the pattern.
---
Livid?
---
I'd be advertising my skills to a new guild.
---
Yes! It's way more about gear until the raiding than it is talents. Although, that assumes the healer is competent.
---
This appears completely written and made for retail players.... doesnt necessarily mean it's a bad video per se but I dont think it will resonate with anyone here.
