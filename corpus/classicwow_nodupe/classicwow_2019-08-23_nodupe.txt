Hey brother
---
What? This type of addon was in vanilla wow too...
---
Bro you can't just whip up 40 people and expect to succeed "whenever everyone's on and wants to play". As I said before, Classic is a TIME SINK and requires a decent level of commitment and a high level of coordination. You think mandatory bi weekly meetings are bad?? Heh....15 years ago top end progression raiding guilds were raiding 4-5x a week.
---
Focus on hitting 60 first then go where the game takes you...
---
On Shattered Hand it was always VC. I never had an issue with it. I always wondered why it was just called DM but people would always call Diremaul DM so it made sense.
---
WoW maintenance has been refined to be quite minimal nowadays. Weekly resets are usually down for 15 minutes and in rare cases go for closer to the full listed hour. Big patches are still only down for a few hours. Maintenance night isn't a big deal anymore
---
Yeah, and it will make sure that this game is ruined as well. Just like every other game that had so much corporate zealotism - including Retail.
---
It's pretty apparent if you look at the amount of people who are okay (or even actively want) "convenience" like fully automated LFG addons and not only that they spend hours to discredit, insult, report and spam people with (empty) threats via PMs here over this.
---
I think I'll not touch Classic WoW with a ten-foot pole, thanks. Private servers have always been the better choice since TBC.
---
And then they wonder why people like that Apex: Legends dev calls them out for being asshats, the players/customers are the sole reason why modern AAA gaming is the way it is.
---
Not shareholders, not the 'evil' CEOs, not even the  'out of touch' devs. It's the customers who enable , nay, demand them to turn gaming into a cesspool that are to be solely blamed. Fuck all of them.
---
Okay, so we're back to the starting point. And rest assured, I've been a hardcore raider since vanilla up to and including a top 100 world Archimonde Mythic kill. I perfectly understand the difference in power between an endgame character and a fresh max level. 
---
And so, if you've read my opening sentence in my reply to you, I said, **I AGREE**.
---
And if you read my post, I spoke about this: The only thing Blizzard has to do is **redesign the flow of the endgame content**, so that new raids and new zones would be able to logically and coherently fit into the progression tree. Yes, this means AQ40 might be a parallel raid to, say, the Dragon Isles, or a tier above it or a tier below it. Yes, this might mean that the stats on it would have to be adjusted, depending on where in the progression tree the items belong. This is something that is trivial to do, especially considering Blizzard does it **automatically** in retail. What of it...?
---
For the record, it seems like your argument so far lambasts Blizzard's... what, raid item balance design team? Which has nothing to do with the spirit of classic, and, along with Blizzard's encounter designers, graphical artists etc, is an element that has been universally acclaimed to only improve with time? Retail WoW is shit because the **class balance team** and the **game designers** have no fucking idea what makes a good MMO, courtesy of class homogenization, and zone railroading/transmogging respectively. Also because its producers are sellouts, what with the ingame shop and whatnot. The rest of the retail team no one on this sub has beef with.

Just go 2 hander fury. Get your hit cap and go to town. It’s up to you make a name for yourself as a beast.

Dual wield needs a crap ton of hit to be super viable, 2 hand it up until that point.

If I plan on being useful for the horde in pvp should I roll druid or rogue. I enjoy stealth but can't decide because idk how each class plays.
---
I mean yes, you can pick up improved backstab, cold blood, prep, and improved ambush (if you really want it), but you're going to be making trade-offs for it.
---
You lose a ton of control swapping out hemo for daggers because your primary cp generator costs nearly 2x as much.
---
Hoofstomp is LIFE!
---
(&lt;3)
---
&gt; but no so much that it would have made sense for them to plan this "strategy" beforehand like you implied before.
---
On the contrary, every annual financial report from A/B is the same: WoW has a 'high year' with a expansion release, and a 'low year' with no comparable release. Blizzard section revenue fluctuates heavily each year due to that release cycle. Bringing in classic will give them a off-year revenue bump, and if successful, it seems sensible that they'd want to continue with another off-year release in 2021.  Enter: TBC.
---
Well you already have the flight path to Menethil when you came over originally so just run to Ironforge, fly to the harbor and hop on a boat. Do your thing in Auberdine and HS back. It doesn't take that much time.
---
My wife heals. So no.
---
1. Totems do affect you, though you can't stack weapon buffs. IE windfury totem will not work on you if you have rockbiter, flametongue, frostbrand, or windfury applied to your weapon.
---
2. Fury is the best pve dps spec in raids, 2h fury is viable on horde due to windfury totem and is competitive throughout MC / Ony and maybe BWL but will fall short later on, of course that only matters if you and / or your guild cares.
---
A tree planted for every death
---
My colon and I are long standing enemies at this point
---
That's what we're talking about.  That's been around since vanilla and it makes forming raids 100% easier.  There's only 2 ways to break this addon:  break addons abilities to use/read chat, and break addons abilities to auto invite.
---
Not all 15k will play at the same times or play daily or play for extended periods of time. There are a lot of factors to consider when estimating the total population a server can support and the 15k number could be way off, it's just pure speculation on my part. 
---
However, if all servers are full or overfilled they will open more servers with free transfers. If some servers are overfilled they'll offer transfer to less populated realms for free. However, It would be a bad idea, in my opinion, to do any of that without live stress testing of current servers without layering. 
---
There will be growing pains during certain phases that we will need to deal with as a community. People who expect or demand Blizzard to have a perfect launch and seamless transitions during major software and hardware changes (phase 1 to phase 2) are irrational and most likely have no idea what goes into major client based software releases. It's not IF there will be downtime but more like how long will it take to get the servers back up and how many weeks will it take for them to be stable. Doesn't matter how well you prep, inevitably something happens you didn't expect and shit hits the fan.
---
What's the thought on leveling gathering profs (mining and/or herb) from the get go? I really want engineering on my pala asap, but I'm unsure if I can keep it up without getting stuck with the masses at start (I took a week off from work and plan to get a bit ahead of the curve).
---
Huh ?
---
As far as name reservations are concerned, moving to a low pop realm before it fills up seems like a great way to get any name you want. If you missed ur name on another server then you've got a second chance

You can definitely grind mobs out for levels! I think I'll be doing so for a few levels this time around

Que? Como?
---
&gt; LFG addons have been around for ages, people used it on private servers too. Icy Veins didn't make it.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It was called vQueue.
---
Pure misrepresentation. vQueue was never in Vanilla. There used to be an addon that functioned similarly to this LFG addon, it was exclusively for AV and it was banned by Blizzard.
---
Do you have any guide or link to builds for PvP daggers ?
---
They would have fucked up WoW 2 immensely if they went that route years ago. It would have been a similar transition to the one between Diablo 2 and Diablo 3, because making the game appealing to the largest audience possible is what Blizzard thought would make them the most money. What they didn't account for was that strategy gives games far less longevity. 
---
Look at games like Fortnight, it is still popular, but it's looking more like a flash in the pan. Then look at Leauge of Legends. People complain about the high learning curve and the shit community, but it's still wildly popular because it takes a ton of time to become proficient in the game. 
---
I hope that Classic shows them that the way they can be most profitable is by making games that people want to continue to play, not drop three months after the next expansion.
---
This sub has blown up recently. It's not the originals bringing this stuff up now. It's the tourists. They will not be able to turn classic into retail. They will just go back to retail if they dont like it. I think this will sort itself out.
---
That's how STV became what it is today.

There is definitely a difference in impact between addons that change community interactions and ones that only change how you organize bags.
---
There's a secret spec that not too many people know about, it's called "Nightfall" which any class that can wield a 2H Ax can go into. So yea, if you like 2H dps, look into getting a Nightfall ax when you can, because people will love you no matter what you do as long as you hit things with that specific ax.

*Arugal Must Die*

"Arugal still resides in **Shadowfang** **Keep**. We cannot claim Silverpine as a strategic stronghold for the Dark Lady until Arugal is slain.
---
I shall see to it that his magic is eradicated, &lt;name&gt;. But I leave it in your hands to see that Arugal meets the death he so deserves.

Travel to **Shadowfang Keep** and put an end to Arugal's foul spells once and for all. Bring to me the vile wizard's head!"

*The Defias Brotherhood*

"There is but one task left for you to complete. Edwin VanCleef must be assassinated. While it saddens me to condemn any man to a death sentence, it is for the greater good of the people of Westfall that VanCleef is laid to rest once and for all. Bring me the villain's head once the deed is done."
---
It never mentions where he is located so LFG VC is the correct way to look for a Deadmines run
---
That's the cool thing about VanCleef. It's the first time that happens to the alliance. After that they figured it out I guess because they don't call SFK AG. It's just another cool quirk that makes VC the best way to say it.
---
There is one that gives you an infinite ignore, I'll try to find it when I get home :)
---
Your max rank stuff cost a lot of mana and you don’t always need it. For example max rank greater healing might cost 600 mana and heal for 3000. But you only need to heal 500-600 to top off the person. Using your max rank would both waste mana resulting in you going OOM and waste healing since it’d be overheal. So instead you can just use rank 4 heal for hypothetically 100 mana and heal for 600. (These numbers where hypothetical to get the point across)
---
In vanilla resource management is important so as a healer you not only need to choose the right heal, but the right spell rank of the heal for the job also. You may have anywhere between 4-8 ranks of the same healing spell in your spell book.
---
That was because LFG chat wasn't global. Now it is. This isn't the EXACT same experience as vanilla there are some minor differences.
---
My wife is considering rolling an enhancement shaman or feral druid. Would a frost mage have good synergy with either of these classes specifically for leveling on a PVE server?
---
This is literally ruining Classic already
---
Autogrouping is the same thing as inviting the first players that whisper you, it can work, but most of the time it's gonna be a bad idea. It *CAN* be done, but it *SHOULDN'T* and in time, when people realise it's not working, *WON'T* be done.
---
This addon is basicly a big "CTRL+F" in chat.
---
It's ok. I'm sure you WoW better than you joke, that's what matters. Kill mobs, get lootz
---
&gt;and to not have to worry about mana like a Warrior,
---
wut
---
If you're horde, 2h fury is *a lot* more viable. It's certainly possible, but dw will quickly outpace is as +hit gear becomes more available.
---
Rogue is fun, but you're basically required to get good at the utility of the spec.
---
Hell, play them all.
---
Well crap lol
---
I took off the full week of the 26th off. I know there is potential for queues but it's going to be worth it!
---
It’s not all about dps. I much prefer having a holy paladin or a fury warrior in a raid, but a good ret paladin will deal ok damage and add plenty of utility to the raid.
---
Aaaaaaaand this is why I don’t play On PVP servers. I wish y’all the pleasure of them but I can’t stand the grieving mentality.

I long for the good old days of forums. Where posts are sorted by recent activity, don't disappear into the void, and don't have a damn voting system. Reddit is so terrible for the kind of conversations I want to have about niche subjects, but it's kinda the only game in town for a lot of things.
---
Same issues with Discord. It's not great for much besides ephemeral chats. I'm mostly using it for the voice features, really.
---
Icy Veins didn't make it was the point I was trying to make.
---
BTW, I'm not supporting LFG tools, I hate them too.
---
There are many of us with kids and jobs now.  
---
The main thing I'm excited for in Classic is being able to use things like this sub to find other on the same pace as me with similar play times.  Back in the day it was terribly hard to find a guild that had raid times that fit your schedule.  And my schedule was a lot more open then.
---
Warrior solo is hard mode. Duo anything works just fine. Warlock and warrior doesnt really stand out as a combo, but you won't have any problem questing, so if that's your fancy, go with it :)
---
Oh frig off. Don't come here and plant seeds of doubt. This is a community that is meant to celebrate and discuss classic. No one forced you to take time off, dude. That's your own fault.
---
Four Horsemen is a server name?
---
its like the same argument as gear score addons. keep that shit away
---
A lot of people seem to forget what existed in Vanilla. Also people are forgetting that the LFG channel is now global.
---
I would reccomend trying to steer clear of guides your first little bit anyway. Figure things out and try to enjoy the game! If you need help at certain parts, look it up, but dont follow a guide directly... at least for a little while ;P
---
I really like this idea. I'm making a dwarf priest with the same name as my dwarf shaman from retail. In his RP back story, I have the idea of him having had a dream about becoming one of the first dwarfs to speak to the elements while exploring new sources of healing magic, which leads to him becoming a shaman. To your point, it'd be like my retail shaman's spirit is transcending back into my priest.

If you want to go engineering, go mining/skinning to 60 and bank your ores (or at least enough ores to level eng later).

Atlas and Atlas Loot were addons in vanilla and had maps and loot. I think it works for classic too.

It's clearly that pipe for the noggen fogger elixir quest. Killed so many of those swamp monsters.

fuck you and your slipery slope apologism.

Who wants to free solo El Cap with me Saturday?
---
Redridge mountains and Tanaris. Something about those two just remind me of better times.
---
&gt; while he uses addons that automaticaly grab quests without opening quest windows, auto completes them the same way, auto sell junk items, grab loots while moving. Are those addons embracing the spirit of classic?
---
Personally? Nah. I don't think that stuff should exist either. If there's one thing that's exhausting my hype for WoW it's all the talk about being efficient everywhere, quickest to 60, gearing, class optimization and guides. Everything has to be picked apart before we can even play the game. Sounds almost to me like people are more interested in running out of things to do rather than have fun, though we do see fun in different things at the end of the day.
---
&gt; I think it will actually promote more people dungeoning and more interactions, instead of people solo questing all the way from 1 to 60. It's not only about saving time, it's also about enabling it, and moving faster for the meaningful interaction, actually whispering other people, asking specs and levels, instead of spamining LFM messages in trade.
---
This I can agree on, but I still hold my stance that I also think it will definitely promote replacing members that are underperforming without giving them a chance to learn or help them improve much like the retail LFD system does.
---
If you're playing a dungeon and someone is causing unnecessary pulls / low damage / wipes, what reason do you have to keep him around if with the ease of a button you can look and see that there's 10 other DPS in line currently searching for a group to the dungeon you're playing? Now obviously it's fair to say that at some point those types of players are just wasting everyone's time and should be replaced if they don't start doing better, but with an addon that improves it like this I don't doubt it will accelerate this process, possibly to a point where some groups are *very* quick with removing a member if there's a chance he will cause problems for them. Though this is naturally influenced if they have a warlock or not as well.
---
If we were to say it like this. I'd rather sit and spam LFG in trade and risk a group misses my message and put everyone through the same wringer than a system that promotes the possibility that certain people won't get to be part of groups at all. It's after all about community, right?
---
Of course it's still a doom-and-gloom scenario that I might just be dramatizing, but you have to be really, *really* careful about systems like this because it is the fact that we accepted "small changes" to how we do things that shit got as bad as it eventually did. There's a number of factors that made people dislike retail WoW, but it's the piling of small changes that caused it to be so different. And at the end of the day you're trusting people to not abuse a system like this, which I don't.
---
&gt; Every raid management addon has this option, Leatrix Plus has it also, you set a word ("inv") and if people whisper you anything that resembles it they get a invite to the party automaticaly.
---
Looking at Leatrix Plus on curse, and yeah. I think many of the options it has shouldn't exist. Not so much the option to automatically invite someone who says "inv" though.
---
But that's not all ClassicLFD offers. It doesn't just auto-invite someone who whispers you. It has a whole UI that updates with people looking for dungeons and shows yours as well, on top of sending messages about your group through chat channels (automatically, even?) Which doesn't really change anything I said at all. It still means you have complete access to a list of groups and people at all times. Which is incredibly convenient to have, too convenient in my opinion.
---
I know it's maybe not as metal as the others, but it'll be a small tragedy if Arugal isn't AC/DC themed.
---
I meant in regards to a Rogue. Like I don't have to worry about mana as a Rogue just like a Warrior.
---
Future MAN dad, I'm a future MAN!
---
You are so shady and scummy to turn my words against me and to try to belittle me by inferring that I don’t socialize much and that that interaction is such a big portion of my socialization.
---
You totally skipped over the dog example I gave which is just one of many many possible interactions. The idea is that people talk to each other as opposed to a program. They might say things to each and interact. How do you not understand that? Yes they might not. And they might just say “invite please”, but your addon totally takes that opportunity for interaction out and doesn’t even give people the chance to interact in the first place.
---
It is totally different. How do you not understand that automatization is no where close to people actually talking to each other. Because of the nature of human beings, a multitude of conversations could spark up at any moment even just from a LFG message. Because of the nature of automatization, none of those conversations can spark up. Such an addon would take that opportunity away and change the roots of the game. However small the conversation it could lead somewhere and that’s part of what makes vanilla vanilla. It just simply goes against the principles of vanilla and leans much more towards what retail is today.
---
signed. Break it. And fuck you to the alsjdfj that made it.
---
As a husky owner and tauren warrior this is hilarious.
---
This is why i like the concept of a BiS list, but dislike the application of it and how it affects player psychology.
---
You can get items that will, in total, be 80-90% as good as BiS and your character will perform so well, and is gonna be so close to what a fully BiS character has, that it's going to be very difficult to tell them apart.
---
These items are generally much easier to get and offer virtually no noticeable differences, but no, gotta have dal rend's because it's BiS bro, gotta speed run UBRS as tight as possible because what's the point of playing if i'm missing *point five percent crit*
---
very cool, would order shirts/patches
---
When you say "min-maxing shitty specs" I imagine you are making the absolute worst specs that could possibly be made.
---
Discord doesnt automatically invite people and you still have to communicate in some manner.
---
I mean it is the only class that every race can play
---
i got free from work next week and am ready to play my druid :) i'm so exited i would love to start rn. my diet will contain mostly pizza and noodles but i will try my best to maybe cooking something healthy after few days.. this is gonna be awesome, got also 5 friends who start with release
---
Just watch dota 2 TI noob
---
did someone send it to blizzard? its possible they block this shit?
---
I've completely given up trying to pick a class. I have now levelled every one past 30 and geared up and played each at 60 on PSers. I am no closer to deciding than when I started.
---
This is on BFA
---
Walk? You mean take the Zeppelin to Orgrimmar and then have a nice stroll through Barrens and Mulgore, picking up flight points along the way.
---
Even so, you don't need ranged weapons on a warrior or rogue until level 15 at the very earliest, and you'll be heading down that way anyway, during that level.
---
Dueling, sure, but in group pvp they are indispensable. Mortal strike provides the punch to get through other organised groups. They also hit absurdly hard.

Oh sounds like you talking about Diablo 3, besides Diablo 3 had that "wow look at this guys gear O_O" for 2 months LOL. Now everyone runs around and 1 shotting elite packs with 4billion crits. Why does every game have to be face paced bullshit?? I like the slow progression where it actually takes time to kill something and feel rewarded after doing so.
---
lol way too many people worried about falling behind. That's the achievements mentality from BFA and it's cancerous to the game. Play at your own pace. There are no achievements or rewards for rushing and the content won't run away. Besides, not everyone will be rushing to 60. In fact, most people will take their time. They're going to have fun and enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Yeah but but that guy over there used a GUIDE! And the girl next to me googled like 30 quests when she got lost and and the kid in the corner posted questions on forums Bc he was lost in a quest chain.
---
Is the total cast time accurate? I thought in classic it was impossible for addons to read which rank was being cast.
---
I already knew they couldn't and I'm not bummed about it. I wish my shaman could use a 2-hander for enh in retail honestly.
---
people run around with permaflags
---
&gt; Mages can AOE grind super easy so might be easier. 
---
My only concern here is going to be finding places for the first month or so where a mage *can* AOE grind.  Things are going to be crowded, even with layering.
---
auto invite addons?

Did someone say something about shaman DW?

Maybe it was a returned as is?

Make a big batch of chili and throw it in the freezer in serving size plastic bags. Add some veg like zucchini or broccoli so it's a balanced meal. Also get some crusty bread or sourdough and throw that in the freezer too (sliced). Toss it in the mic, take a pee break, grab it and go straight back to the computer :D
---
Unfortunately I'm not going hardcore, but this is what I'd do!
---
Multibox all three then you just need 2 random dps and you can summon them to the dungeon.
---
I've prepared a list of alts and their professions, this way I have a balance of all the professions I might want  matched up nicely with their class/race. I can't decide who will be my main yet (will likely focus on a druid first to get mats/gold), so I also have two 'potential mains' planned out. 
---
Knowing me, I'll probably play a little on all of them.
---
That's fair, sorry if I came off as aggressive. Dealing with a bit of a headache. My big worry with a convenient system like this anyways is that it will promote that a part of the player base won't get to finish dungeons because they're slow learners or similar. If 10 DPS are in queue for the dungeon you're playing, at the end of the day someone will eventually ask himself "why are we keeping this guy that does so low damage around?" sorta.
---
I'm a bit doom-and-gloom about it though.

I AM GOING TO TAKE UP EXTREME SPORT DRIVING LIKE A RETARD JUST TO SPITE YOU OP!

Shamans aren't tanks.  It's not "suboptimal"
---
the classic purity crowd almost makes me not even want to play classic. :/
---
Yes, and now your idea makes a bit more sense..... and it is fucking terrible. People that want classic+ 2 etc, want to lengthen the experience, not drastically change it by inserting content throughout an experience that was already complete. 
---
Both ideas have major faults, yours is especially bad because it drastically changes the world, lore and content flow without adding anything beneficial to the lengthening of the game or without fixing anything that becomes a glaring problem late game.
---
You also do not mention playing vanilla wow much at all besides possibly original release. 
---
I can say from your retail fluffing that you are just grabbing at clouds and shotgunning ideas without much consideration at all....,

Laden Dew Gland from Tanaris. I did it in TBC if I'm not mistaken, maybe even WotLK, but the item is in the game from Vanilla. I remember spending there countless hours filling my bags with shitty grey Empty Dew Glands.
---
There were a couple of LFG addons back in vanilla, I know because I used one and so did the guilds I was in. All they did was let you list a group and accept invites or send invites if it was your group. But we did have them back then.
---
Yes, they are working on it. https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/tree/development
---
If something is a 10% boost to one person, and a 1% boost to another person. The person who takes the 1% over the 10% is still getting an upgrade, but it is going to make people question their group mentality. 
---
Wow is social, selfishness has its place but it also has its limits.
---
Yah figured you were delusional
---
Do you think it's worth logging into the character screen a day or so before launch to try skip the queue?
---
Bandage and food, don't forget to log out in an inn.
---
Leveling isn’t hard as long as you’re prepared.
---
Damn, this is me.  Told warrior buddy I was going priest but...the demons are calling to me...
---
Yes. Raiding is not for every1 and it doesn't have to be. Just play your game. Lots of content outside the raids.
---
Ok thanks for the detailed reply, even better since you seem to be the dev / are following the development.
---
&gt;Only thing it show now is talent distribution, like *"31/5/0"*, and this feature is being removed.
---
I think this is the only thing that has a real drama potential after your clarifications for the rest. It's very good news that it is being removed. I personally always had a very weird hybrid spec across all three trees on my char in Vanilla, and was doing perfectly fine in dungeon and PvP. If such an addon would make most people avoid me because of that feature, I would probably stop trying to 5 man PuG altogether. And I would definitely not like the game as much.
---
And to reply to other unconscious people : No, I shouldn't be satisfied to just be able to do 5 mans with my friends/guildies. Vanilla wasn't like that, I loved pugs and made tons of friends and great encounters / experiences through it, and don't want it to be ruined because of an addon.
---
Ok soldier, first off they weren’t my discord comments, and two taking the rivalry seriously is where you went way, way wrong
---
King’s Honor, friend.
---
... Right...You have an "amazing" girlfriend, that you've spent the summer with, that you've discussed classic with for months, and you need what again?
---
Classic movie.
---
Sure...xd
---
&gt;Grobbulus and Stalagg actually sound like metal band names
---
There is a metal band called Stalaggh. Extremely underground, possibly illegal project. They're known for employing mental patients to supply their vocals.
---
Not a bad way to go about it if you ask me. Especially if you’re constantly in need for names.
---
By that point it would be too late if it was already in widespread use.
---
all the more reason to remember it
---
&gt;Yeah i know, the joke is there is 94 hours left till launch like the name of the song. heee, might not be my best one.
---
You ain't gonna be hard casting spells while tanking lol
---
You DC after 30 minutes at the screen so logging in early won’t help at all :(
---
Anyone see a blue post confirming if the timezones are also where they will be hosted and if ping will suffer?
---
When I was trying to reserve my names the queues were so long and I picked Herod but I think it was so overwhelmed it got confused.  After almost an hour waiting for it to load it dropped me onto Fairbanks.  I tried to load the server list and it just was not having it.  I ended up reserving my names and being done with it. 
---
I'm hoping all servers are at HQ and just set for timezones to help players.  I don't want shit ping :'(. That's too vanilla for me
---
Absolutely things can get crowded, you can find some out of the way locations that aren't well known to grind.
---
Even dungeon grinding (BRD) is pretty common, means you are not contested for spawns, the learning curve though, might make it a bit tough.
---
*HAAAAVE AT THEMMMM, BOYS*
---
Eh, let it die down for a few days before you hop in. It'll be madness anyway.
---
^...this ^is ^what ^I'm ^telling ^myself ^since ^I ^won't ^be ^able ^to ^play ^until ^later ^in ^the ^week...
---
&gt; If you played back then you remember forming the group was the hardest part sometimes. It took time and patience. On that alone you would know who would still stick around if a wipe occurred.
---
Lol, you think people will quit easily just because they saved a few minutes forming the group? That's silly, people are still going to be less likely to leave the groups than in retail, though i also remember leavers being an issue in vanilla.
---
&gt; Also, retail didn’t suddenly become what it is today. Small changes like this one occurred, one after another. And some of them came from addons first. 
---
Retail was constantly updated though while classic won't be, they won't add things like this to the game officially so we will have what addons are limited to and it won't get worse than that.
---
I remember when it was around 2006,I was a NE druid around lvl 30. My brother was hardcore at the time and was already 50 and he was killing horde in tanaros and I thought 'wow what a cool zone' so i wrote in my school agenda 'cant wait to be in tanaris!" I was like 11 at the time
---
I can't wait to go charging into WSG at level 10 and get my ass beat. Gonna be great
---
It automates invites and removes communication from the game. It is harmful for the spirit of classic and goes firmly against what blizzard has stated.
---
There is a lot more that goes into forming group than "spamming chat" some sort of communication happens prior to the invite and being able to just tab out and have people in group is harmful.
---
I have a feeling PUG raids will be very common in Classic. The complexity of raid boss fights was pretty low and the gear requirements weren't that significant either for the early content. Also, people just know more now than they did in 2005, so everyone is going to be far more proficient players than 15 years ago. A decent sized guild throwing a group together with some PUGs is not outside the realm of reason.
---
&gt; &gt; [LookigForGroup] [Pussyslayerx]: LF1M dps X dungeon
---
&gt; &gt; 
---
&gt; &gt; To [Pussyslayerx]: inv pls
---
&gt; speech level 100
---
&gt; much social interaction
---
Yeah, and while you scanned the chat for that particular dungeon group you read all the other stuff that gets posted in chat.     
---
Banter, rumours, news about stuff that happens within the community and the latest trolling attempt of the resident server troll. Maybe you chat some yourself because something in chat caught your attention while you were looking for a group. 
---
All of that doesn't happen if you simply click a button that spams chat for you and whispers people "invite please" automatically.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On the other end of the group forming process we have a group leader that can filter out anyone that messages him based on their reputation. Ninja Looters or people that are known to be assholes simply don't get an invite.     
---
When using the AddOn, it auto invites anyone that fits the bare minimum criteria, and that kind of evaluation doesn't happen - and once a player is in the group, it's far more convenient to just start instead of removing the already auto-invited player - player reputation be damned. In the end this will only lead to a community where toxic players can get away with their shit easier.
---
May be restricted but this isn't dungeon finder, this is more like the LFG tool at best. 
---
And may be restricted isn't unequivocal.
---
Meh they say the same shit about people like boogie2988
---
Great time to score an aderall script and a sick note at the same time
---
I played Rift for years. Raids were amazing, and because the player base was smaller it still had a great community. Sadly the last expansion was basically Walmart Legion and it's been in maintenance mode for 2+ years. Rift is dead.
---
&gt; False advertisement is illegal.
---
AHAHAHAA it's this moron again.  Get Method arrested yet?
---
Yeah sorry to say but rogues destroy warriors 1v1
---
Try opening it and cleaning it up. It might be super dusty.
---
It's literally stickied at the top of this sub
---
Who are you Tommy Wiseau?
---
We can't get the actual rank but for the player's casts (only) the API provides the start and end timestamps (end-start=duration), so it's accurate :)
---
Wait how are you playing?
---
Go Warrior.
---
I almost at 10,000 hours in that game since 2012
---
Thanks for the suggestion! 
---
Yeah that's the plan, every hour is bathroom break, grab something and head back to the PC (my computer desk is adjacent to my kitchen), trying to stay on the healthier side of course. I don't want to sacrifice my health over this!
---
This is interesting, that kind of world pvp actually sounds fun.
---
I think it can be a mix of both. I feel like guides for me provided the guardrails and rough path forward. I’ll still do dungeons, pvp, professions, etc as I please along the way.
---
Can you detect spell ranks? The other addon like this couldn't.  
---
e.g. Healing Wave's cast time can vary from 1.5 to 3.0 seconds depending on rank
---
Will fondle someone if they pick a shaman and follow me around with windfury
---
Do a random number generator! There are two possible outcomes:
---
1. While the numbers are rolling you’ll have a subconscious tick hoping for something
---
2. You get no such tick and the random number decides your fate!
---
What's the best LFG add-on for classic? I'd like to have one to use while leveling, so I don't have to stop questing to do a dungeon that many people might be willing to do, but aren't all in Stormwind or IF at the moment.
---
Wow... The lighting is beautiful. Are you using any kind of reshader here?
---
Warriors can tank as whatever spec while leveling. Healers can heal as whatever spec as well while leveling. Druids and paladins basically need to be their respective tanking spec to tank after about level 35-40. Shaman cannot tank period unless it’s for memes or dungeons below level 30. 
---
Farming by grinding is hard as a tank or healer but there is other ways to earn gold. Honestly almost no one made gold by grinding mobs. I’m not sure where this idea was propagated from.
---
As far as other content at max level. There really isn’t any other content. You have the option of raiding / dungeons / PvP / and sitting in your capital city and socializing like it’s an aol chat room. Most activity centered around farming materials to prepare for raids, and socializing in chat. 
---
It’s not like retail. There’s not much single player content. There’s no dailies. You won’t go to some island and do a bunch of weird mini games and quests for pretty prizes. 
---
Sometimes wed play battlegrounds, sometimes we sit on the opposite factions zeppelin / boat and troll / grief people, sometimes I’d sit in winterspring for several hours fishing and talking to people in guild chat, sometimes we’d sit outside dueling and talking shit for hours, sometimes I’d grind green whelps for hours because I wanted their vanity pet and it took me nearly 2 weeks of killing them to drop, and then everyone logged in and we’d slay dragons, zombies, and rock monsters. 
---
It was a far simpler time. Try not to be too intimidated.
---
Are you asking how statistics work? I said a higher percent, not a higher raw number.
---
We had addons in vanilla. Go away.
---
Including BC stuff? Arthas stuff is fine tbh... but BC?
---
Yeah we're alliance, and other PT  PvP servers are heavily horde-oriented.
---
I kinda wanna go Bigglesworth OMEGALUL but my friends and I have already moved 3 times and they don't wanna move again
---
Why is EU getting more servers than NA?

Is this a joke? Pagle is a PvE server. No one is getting ganked anywhere ...
---
They also said elsewhere in that presentation that the API allowed for a lot of things to be done, that they don't want to allow now. Specifically add-on makers are a whole lot smarter about coding and building addons, and this means some stuff that was possible in classic won't be now. The presentation was pretty interesting, I highly recommend watching it.
---
If a warrior, rageboner, purely for rp value.
---
People were warning about this a year ago, but the #nochanges crew freaked out when we said the addon API might need to be nerfed.
---
It doesn’t remove communication.  It streamlines it.  It removes BARRIERS to communications.
---
Nah man more people joining with no interest in RP means less RP on the whole.
---
Couldn’t agree more. I’m going to enjoy the leveling experience with a guide (there’s no way around it, you can’t exactly blow through Classic)
---
To me, time is my most valuable asset. I don’t want to spend hours and hours backtracking or going to main cities and telling people I’m out quests help! No.
---
God damnit all I want is a decent West PvP server name other than Whitemane. We have the worst server names by far... Fairbanks, BlowMe, now Pigglesworth? Isn’t Blizzard based in Irvine? How about some love for the home team? I’m staying on Whitemane.
---
August 26, 2019 10:00 AM , we will remove the limitation on only creating a total of three WoW Classic characters per WoW account.
---
Role-playing happens there. Also names are more strictly policed
---
6% of the population of an entire state is a majority... ok. Got it.  
---
Also, New Jersey accent still doesn't equal Jewish.
---
All these realm names are pretty good, but Bigglesworth is gonna be a huge server on the name alone lol
---
They are my BiS till a year out/my guild rogues all have Dals then i can need roll a 62 and cry because instead of my group not letting get them, the game wont.
---
Right. Do your research. Every single pre-bis list agrees on this.
---
It will be Alliance heavy but probably not 80/20.

Whaaa

I wouldn’t stress it too much. Retail became this weird flex version of the game where everyone was expected to be a pro gamer before even entering end game content. Having played OG vanilla (it’s still my favorite), I can tell you that Classic is going to be a much more relaxed experience. Honestly, I would recommend both tanking and healing. It doesn’t hurt to try them out and while the content can be difficult, I think there will be plenty of players willing to help you along the way. Classic is more about the experience, the world, and the social aspect than just being force fed epics. Anyone that is expecting retail level loot satisfaction and difficult raid mechanics won’t be around long enough to give you any shit :). 
---
The classes are EXTREMELY different in Classic so I would really urge you to branch out and try something new. You might find a new main :P.

your boss a piece of shit because america is coercion economics, so the chance to not come in even tho u know its coming is relished bc u dont what the piece of shit to act more shitty knowing u are gonna miss time or fuck around with it. rather surprise that  piece of shit

You get full spell power scaling on low level spells while you are still at the level appropriate for them.
---
* Are you taking time off from work/school for launch day or launch week?
---
   * I mostly work flex hours in multiple contract jobs, so I have been working my ass off this week so I can have a few days to play -- however, I definitely screwed up and committed to going to a baseball game on launch night thinking the release was on Tuesday (USA).
---
* Any exercise plans between now and launch?
---
   * I'm training for a Spartan Ultra race right now, so probably just continuing my normal routine both now and during launch.  Nothing will really change.
---
* What snacks / food will you be eating and drinking during launch?
---
   * Nothing special -- normal.
---
* Any advice for the rest of us, e.g., "get up and stretch once every hour"?
---
   * As someone who coached health/wellness and lost 95 pounds myself.  Get up and stretch.  If you have a standing desk, use it from time to time.  Don't pound energy drinks -- I used to consume 1,500mg caffeine a day and it screwed up a lot.  1-2 probably won't kill you. HAVE FUN!
---
* Any last chores you've gotta get done before launch day?
---
   * Going backpacking this weekend.  Planning on starting the process for a gallon of mead.
---
* Please share your own thoughts, but feel free to use the above ideas as starting points of discussion
---
   * I am really excited to get in this with you all.  Hope to see you out on the fields of Azeroth.

In the name of the Queen I hereby claim the server Mograine for the British. As unbefitting for us, we haven't actually claimed anything yet unlike the other pesky Europeans.

Twinks literally are end-game for me. It’s a way to “complete” a character in a matter of weeks rather than years and just get to the good stuff (pvp)

Auto grouping without talking is already built into the game. Meeting stones outside dungeons and inn keepers will queue you up and automatically put you into a group with others who are queue'd. Zero communication required and that was built into vanilla.  
---
 **Meeting Stones**, also known as **Summoning Stones**, are very large thumb-shaped stones with a mystical, glowing symbol that appear next to [instanced](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Instance) dungeons. Originally[\[1\]](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Meeting_Stone#cite_note-0), they were for filling in partial (or just-starting) [parties](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Party) whose members met the required level range[\[2\]](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Meeting_Stone#cite_note-1) by auto-inviting suitable candidates.   
---
 📷 [**Patch 1.5.0**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.5.0) **(2005-06-07):**
---
* Innkeepers around the world now have a gossip option that lets you join a meeting stone directly from the innkeeper rather than going to the location of the meeting stone. Also these Innkeepers will now have background lore about each of the dungeons.
---
“Grinding our a level of two” in Vanilla requires several hours of time. Add that up over your course of 1-60 and you’re wasting a lot of time. I have such limited time to okay this game as is I’m going to DREAD having to log on after work for three hours and hoping I can grind enough mobs to get back to questing  the next day.
---
I've tested it and it works.
---
You’re a god
---
It's also BiS for hunters... look up any list and they all agree on this.
---
Yes because once you are in the party, you are forbidden to say “what’s up all”.
---
It appeals to the male fantasy.
---
Meh, horde have an entire town with quests there, alliance have 1 npc standing by a bush.
---
Is this just for NA, or EU aswell? :)
---
Fr, these people acting like there's a choice anyway.
---
I liked perception a lot 🥰😍
---
Hi everyone! I was hyped for classic release and decided to create a website to list all dungeon quests + prequest chains. The main reason was because I want to do every dungeon quest there is and it's a hassle to follow a whole quest chain on classicdb or wowhead and coordinate with a lot of people.
---
Maybe its useful for someone as well, each quest contains a link to classicdb to get more info about it.
---
EDIT: It might be a bit clunky on mobile devices because it's mainly intended for desktop.
---
Have never played a single minute of WoW. This is kind of exciting.
---
Horde always have more in pvp servers
---
I’m still waiting to hear. If you don’t think I’m willing to have a good faith discussion, why bother talking to me at all? Sounds like you’re the one who could use the win.
---
I can’t believe people think it’s going to be the same. The majority of the classic base is going to have 15+ years of wow/mmo experience. Yes there are idiots, but the majority will be able to mongo their way through a vanilla dungeon because they are just simply very easy.
---
almost every possible name for a classic server has been suggested somewhere in this subreddit.
---
The current Vanilla world record is about 116 hours. I know it's been beat on pservers, and I won't be surprised if it gets beat on these servers either. We are not the same population of gamers that we were in 2005. Assuming you're PST (and if you're not it only gets worse), you have 129 hours until midnight on Saturday from launch hour. You're giving yourself 13 hours of sleep (not to mention your runs) over 5 nights to match the existing Vanilla world record.
---
Still planning on hitting 60 in that time?
---
Because everybody's experience and expectation is different and that's okay
---
Will be watching the Southpark Wow episode while in queue
---
No, I dont think so.
---
Farming mobs was a little too shallow as an example i guess. What i wonder is, if the situation i'm in requires me to deal damage, how well that i fill that requirement. Not compared to DPS ofcourse.
---
same lol
---
The baddies will use it and wipe over and over again
---
You're *always* going to want first aid in any situation. And it's more useful while leveling too so if you want to train profs while leveling, I'd go with that.
---
Not if your ping is better than everyone else's.
---
No it doesn't. There will still be tons of RP. Jimbob rolling on it doesn't suddenly stop anyone from RPing. Like I said, even in a panic people aren't rolling enmass on either RP server. The majority of people *will* stick to their guns and try to get in their normal PvE/PvP server.
---
FOMO. Worked with crypto currency, works with wow. Strong psychological tool.

Cuz the devs want to go home tomorrow night and not have to babysit new realms

This addon has a talent inspect option which was not in Vanilla. Are you saying this feature was available in Vanilla?
---
The author lies about the auto-invite feature. He specifically states there is no automatic matchmaking. However, the addon allows you put yourself in a queue and step away from your keyboard, addon auto spams the chats and auto invites people, you come back to find a full group. If that's not automatic matchmaking then I don't know what is.
---
There used to be an AV queue addon that auto-invited people, forming groups quickly for AV. In fact, it worked just like this addon and it was shut down by Blizzard.
---
I am questioning the intent of the author. It's clear he didn't create this addon just for the purpose of a LFG bulletin board. That's not what the addon is. He backtracks in several posts on curse and also provides misleading info. I wouldn't be surprised if he adds the option to inspect ilvl/gear in the future when enough donators request the option. I mean you can already inspect talents which goes against the spirit of Classic and has the potential to exclude people who do not run cookie cutter specs.
---
Brace yourself NA
---
What time zones?
---
Don't more people die from household accidents?  (cowers in a corner of her house because everything is Final Destination now)
---
LBRS is pretty linear, they key is to not jump or skip cause that's when shit gets fucked.
---
Less crowded starting areas.
---
I would advise you focus on doing one thing as well as you can rather than doing two things poorly.
---
It was in vanilla from very early on. Not only could you go to the meeting stones in vanilla you could do it from any inn keeper to get auto grouped for the dungeons.
---

Which inheritely diminishes the social aspect of the game this will reinforce lower communication in groups. It will reach a point where you put your group up go to the dungeon and afk till full group then just go through without saying a word. To say it wont is naive cause this is exactly how retail reached its current state. Remove the invite and auto invite button and toggle and this addon is perfectly fine and would function like people are claiming it is. A chat log parser.
---
I suppose the most popular one would be either Prat or some threat meter addon. Less notable but still common addons would be Gatherer, extended ignore lists, goldseller filters, Deadly Boss Mods, guild calendars, and unit frame addons that coordinated heals.
---
Addons also used to (maybe they still do?) apply the chat API for some seemingly unrelated things because of other restrictions. For example, update reminders were done by asking other players if they had a newer version of the addon.
---
One thing people forget to include in the well played hybrid vs poorly played pure is the most likely reason the pure is poorly played is they are inexperienced, which will obviously not be the case forever and will easily improve most of the time to a decent player, which beats hybrid.
---
Oooohhh. I wasn't paying attention enough apparently.
---
I'll leave it up to Blizzard to make the call on whether it stays. They seem to be squarely focused on authentic gameplay. If they investigate and say it's okay, then it's okay. They agreed with what you say. But if they ban it, I don't have a problem with that either.
---
Honestly, I don't think that's it- there were plenty of addons that everyone knew about/used back then. That CTA wasn't one of them even when it had a couple expansions of time as an addon says to me that it was a minor convenience addon that people *didn't* feel mandated to use. Plus, CTA can find/interact with people without the addon just fine- it wouldn't kill normal group finding.
---
Of* yeah seems like I'll have after seeing that.
---
The benefit? Not waiting 2 hours for a WSG to pop and then miss it while you’re on the shitter.
---
Yes because right click remove from party is such an inconvenience.
---
Hey Thraix, could I put Mithril Spurs (mount) + Enchant boots minor speed (unmounted) on the same item?
---
I actually meant to just describe the two versions of young players I felt like I came accross. Horde had the young teenage edgelords while alliance had the slightly younger crowd. 
---
As far as the adults on each side of the factions I think Horde was more violent pvp metal fans and alliance were the try hard raid teamwork personality. In a VERY VERY general sense obviously and this is just how i saw it and felt like it was the case on my realm. Both factions had their share of everyone I described, it just swayed a bit more one way or the other.

Realtalk: Nothing hyped you up like when you’re in a new zone and you kill some humanoids and they drop the next level of cloth.

Alliance on Gul'Dan as well (US - somehwere)

No Alestorm/Bloodsail cover?
---
The split is 80-20 based off a a Reddit survey. It’s hardly an indication of what the end split will be. I think the survey had less than 1000 people polled as rolling on Pagle which leaves a lot of grey area seeing how the server is full so there’s way more people that haven’t filled it out.
---
Hover over the time in the post lol
---
Didn't the Peggle addon turn into a stand alone game even?
---
Where do you draw the line on addons? Is the line crossed if you add an advantage the player can't otherwise have? If so you'd better uninstall Questie first, DBM / BigWigz second, better not use Auctionator or Recount.
---
Retail features being added back that give advantages? Because you should definitely uninstall the castbar and enemy hp addon you have, as well as the debuff timer. Definitely shouldn't use an addon that auto tracks quests either.  I sure hope you're not using an addon to dismount you when you try to cast spells.
---
Are you against addons created after Vanilla being added into Classic?  **[Here's an addon created in 2004 for LFG](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-3109)** - Not widely adopted because of less people using addons back then, but it existed.
---
Before Blizz added their new and useful (WoD, not the one implemented in BC) group finder I used oQueue, this isn't any different to that during Burning Crusade/Wrath there was an addon called Call To Arms.
---
If you can't pinpoint the line this addon (but none of those addons) crosses, then Blizz can't either to make it into a rule.
---
And yet I still...
---
*unzip*
---
Dude this addon is really bringing out the morons.  It really shows how in today's society reality and facts don't matter as much as someone's outrage.

&gt;beyond what?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;And as I said, most people are probably still going to have no more than a handful of addons. So I don't even know what you are worried

Then I will be allot more efficent then they are. If they are not banned I wil get a dozen that give me an unfair advantadge and will dumb down the game for me.

I stand corrected, then.  Gonna try a priest as my alt, so hopefully you're right...

So it's not a cause where say
---
Person A: Creates a listing for DPS in the addon UI
---
Person B on the other continent: Addon updates and he can now see player A's listing?
---
Just asking because I don't support the classic LFD addon at all but that knowledge is pretty important and I must've missed it.
---
The Adderall was strong.
---
I don't want to talk to you people. Let me just use LFG addon and you can stick to your LFG chat. 
---
It's all just: I don't like it so remove it for everyone.
---
Cool story, it still goes against the spirit of the game and things that automate gameplay is something blizzard is firmly against and has stated such. With the current age of information spreading like wildfire the addon isnt going to be able to fly under the radar like it so much in vanilla.

It's a character building experience, a rite of passage for any aspiring nelf.

Even for Horde I think it might be a good place to go to get away from the crowds.

I have no idea what blizzard is thinking here

7pm character creation ffs around that time iam sleeping to get that server launch sleepschedule in now I have to wake up 3 hours earlier for my name reservation? REEEEE
---
I have a lot of people that I know, not from a friends list, but because they post a lot on LookingForGroup. I also play on a pretty popular server (Sargeras). 
---
Just from everybody playing on the same server, you’ll remember people and start seeing them around.
---
This auto invite feature is already built into vanilla via meeting stones and inn keepers. The dangerous parts of dungeon finder IMO anyway are automatic porting to the dungeon and grouping with people from other servers (both of which no add on can do). If you don't like this auto invite feature you are going to have to change the core game from how it originally was.
---
**Meeting Stones**, also known as **Summoning Stones**, are very large thumb-shaped stones with a mystical, glowing symbol that appear next to [instanced](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Instance) dungeons. Originally[\[1\]](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Meeting_Stone#cite_note-0), they were for filling in partial (or just-starting) [parties](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Party)whose members met the required level range[\[2\]](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Meeting_Stone#cite_note-1) by auto-inviting suitable candidates.

patch 1.5

Pro tip: wait til 2-3 weeks in to take time off to play classic 
---
The first week going to lots of queue and downtime
---
Thanks.  After reading this post, I got motivated to go mow, weed eat, and spray my yard.  Very productive... now what?
---
Corsair strafe

a) that's just your opinion, man, and b) who said anything about 2 months min maxing? All I said was it's bottom of the barrel for dps. you'd literally bring a boomkin over enhance just looking at numbers.

ok what I am saying is that in wrath, when I had HDD on a WD black, I had upgraded to a SSD
---
at the time, before the upgrade, when I needed to load was when I ported to dal from sw or hearthed
---
after the ssd upgrade, the loading still existed, as I was hoping the SSD would make everything seamless, IE little to no loading when porting. but that was not the case, there was still loading, just a bit faster.
---
the same thing persisted in mop, with the shrine 
---
and same in wod with the garrison
---
each expansion, there was loading when teleporting around, and not so much when i was streaming (IE travelling) on foot or on a flying mount. 
---
it seems that wow unlike other games (cough anthem), the loading is highly optimized, and that hdd vs ssd will have little impact, unless your ram cannot hold all the information needed (or so I think).

Thanks.

I hate it.

There is about 15 in the cave and in the immediate area outside. It's he easiest way to level in that range because you can get to Thorium level. What people usually do is park there for a few days and log in on the spawn, from another character (usually a mage alt or hunter for farming). Now you will be able to strip mine several layers. This is just one instance and something I shared with you (a moron). There are other things that would be far more lucrative. BTW the swingtimer won't matter on rogue as far as sword procs. Welcome to classic. That was broken in TBC and if you think they are going to make something like that accurate you haven't been paying attention. Enjoy a 8 year old matching your dps on rogue and thinking raiding matters in a heavily nerfed Tier 1 and 2 that is dumbed down below WOTLK 25 man that Kungen cleared with 10 people. Deadmines will be harder than BWL in Classic:) Oh and the funny thing is now you are wanting a group finder in something that will be easily pugged. You are helping to break Classic and are so dumb you don't realize it. Enjoy the destroyed community and dead servers. You are playing right into Brack and Ion's hands. They never wanted to make it and the CEO who did was pushed out of the company. Blizzard no longer has a CEO and Ion would be fired if this dwarfs BFA. Good thing there are people as stupid as you who don't realize it's sabotaged.
---
Reading those messages is hilarious. I mean you actually though you would get to show some skill on a rogue in raids. Good luck with that son. Especially with threat being much less of an issue than it was in real vanilla due to weapon rebalancing or tanks flat out wearing 2 handers for threat due to how much of a joke 1.12 itemization. 16 debuffs instead of 8 and 1.12 talents are as far as dps increases. the best tank Horde side is going to be a troll with a 2 hander. This isn't vanilla. This is an abomination.
---
No need to be in the Blizzard classic wow team to realise that 2 PVP servers are not enough for Europe.
---
Even now, after adding 2 more servers after people could reserve their name, it looks like 4 servers are still to few.
---
But maybe we're all just to stupid and blizz got figuered it out! But somehow i think that on release every server is going to be "Full" because not everybody with interest has already a sub.
---
Edit: Blizz just annouced 4 new PVP servers, those servery should be here from the begining, hardly anybody is going to switch.
---
Bigglesworth it is!!!!! For the Alliance!!!!
---
thanks
---
Judging by the comments, no.
---
I tend to remember shit like this quite easy myself.
---
Glad they decided to leave the better names till last as it'll be much easier to persuade people to move/fill up. Still wish they chose Ashbringer and Thunderfury though.
---
[Preach brother](https://i.imgur.com/lo4bwO8.jpg)
---
Also easy dungeons that didn't require CC or healer drinking.
---
I'm confused still - how do you train arcane intellect before level 2?
---
damn i didn't see that the first time around shit thats good lol
---
have we gotten a link to the NA servers
---
You just learn the order, so "okay my actual face is 3 clicks from now"
---
Ha, it would be just like old times
---
Let’s see what layering and dynamic spawns look like before judging?
---
Was the screenshot of the chinese classic server being called Bruce fake or real? might have to roll over there
---
this is a great idea and a great start 
---
but the first thing i looked up was holy paladin weapons and it has some greens with no spell power between the epics and blues 
---
please keep working on it though something like this could help a lot of people
---
but when suggesting incorrect items its not helping much
---
Shadow priest is a one of in raids, making it the best of these options.

&gt;...I couldn't stand spending half my WoW time in a death pit with skeletons and green slime lava everywhere. I felt like some emo goth edgelord playing undead.

Here you go
---
&gt;Are you taking time off from work/school for launch day or launch week?
---
I lucked out and launch week is a work free week because I'm in between jobs while moving. 
---
&gt;Any exercise plans between now and launch?
---
Just the usual stretching and making sure I'm not sitting in the chair for hours on end. 
---
&gt;What snacks / food will you be eating and drinking during launch?
---
Went to Grocery Outlet today and got some good deals on some hippy "healthy" frozen breakfasts and lunch/dinners. Some salami/pepperoni, crackers, and honey dijon almonds for energy between meals. Small little lentil soups for the same. Bananas for banana and peanut butter sandwiches. Some green tea, a few peach mango Bangs, and La Croix. Maple granola and maple greek yogurt for breakfast/sweet tooth cravings. Some Quaker breakfast bars. And some random mango hot sauce to toss on those frozen meals. 
---
&gt;Any advice for the rest of us, e.g., "get up and stretch once every hour"?
---
Seriously guys, fucking stay hydrated! 
---
&gt;Any last chores you've gotta get done before launch day?
---
Finish packing for the move which is easy since I'm packing light. Clean out the junk in my car and give it a good vacuuming. Clean out some junk in garage while I'm at it. And right now I'm going to make myself a tasty beverage and get my desk cleared and wiped down!
---
If you take over 20 minutes to form a group you may aswell kill yourself tbh.
---
Since you seem to know a fair bit about the addon (much more than me anyways) there is a question I'd like to ask, that I read elsewhere:
---
&gt; From what I understand the addon currently only parses chat messages with people LFG and then puts them in a list. It does not, and the author has no intention of, making it into an auto accept lfg. You have to message people still and someone has to spam LFG, this basically stores specific chat messages for you and puts them into an easily readable list.
---
So it's not necessarily a case where the addon automatically updates whenever someone posts a listing in the addon itself, but rather it still needs to be updated by picking up someone's LFG request in chat?
---
When you were talking about the parsing the chat part I assumed it was more specifically in regards to inviting people. From the screenshots and the video it looked like the actual "grouping" and "searching for members" was all done through the addon on it's own.
---
I don't think hes implying he will ninja the same person twice. He just plans on bouncing around different groups. The major flaw is if the addon is scarcely used then everyone will know is name. If that happens he still wins because the addon isn't being used.  
---
Truly is a win/win in his eyes
---
Moved to Golemagg !
---
Thanks man seems useful
---
x5 when all their mates pile on.
---
It was the main reason I finally quit for good.
---
Helcular's Rod. I didn't start counting til it got ridiculous, I counted 308 Yetis before it dropped.
---
Wut?? The dragons are basically tank n spank. The dreamer event tho with the egg?? Now that shit is difficult!
---
Fuck me, makes me a little nervous of queues even though I will be on one of the servers that was slower to full if they can just drop five new servers.
---
but that requires the person with the addon to read world chat.
---
the point of this addon is to ignore chat basically. so you need to know about me, via world chat news to ignore me. If not, thanks for the invite and loot lol
---
They have definitely underestimated the amount of players that will play Classic. I'm glad that they can add new servers quickly.
---
Neat. Kinda like you traveled to an alternative dimension where history went awry. Perhaps the alliance lost a few key battles and the horde laid siege over the lands.
---
I've heard legends of an elf who got to 10 in a row.
---
yeah noticed Peacemaker is missing from the 2h weaps when checking hunter
---
I honestly believe you're having a tough time understanding why certain addons are frowned upon. Just watch this:
---
https://twitter.com/EsfandTV/status/1164608941852176384
---
Yes, API exists. That doesn't mean there should be an addon for it. If you're still confused then I suggest you watch that video a second time.
---
How would you know you that they are using it?
---
Also would this not go under griefing other players?
---
Danes and Norwegians moved to Firemaw after starting out on Shazz which has gotten way too crowded. We moved once. %-)
---
I'm not too familiar with this addon i just keep seeing the debate here. but it seems all this addon will really do is make it so you dont need to wait forever to get a group together. 
---
i mean, i started in bc, and we used to queue up and have to wait fucking forever for a group, or ask in general chat until someone joined. it was absolute hell. but i dont use addons so no matter what im not installing it. 
---
I am so excited to get back into dungeons where you actually have to walk to the location. thats all that matters imo. i dont see how this addon will affect the dungeoning itself.
---
There aren't a dozen addons that give you an unfair advantage. But even if there were, then go right ahead, anyone that cares about their preformace will do the same.
---
Got downvoted for arguing against these LFG trash addons today. What a load of BS.
---
Morgraine is THE British server, I work for MI5.
---
There's no way it's worse than what the early days of vanilla had.
---
Everything was bloated garbage that tookup most of the visible space on the screen.
---
It wasn't until later that minimalist designs became the thing.
---
im talking about the exact same animations.
---
LFG Addon will be terrible for classic might as well Release pandas before release too, fuck it.
---
Same here man. Why can't they just give us another pacific pvp server with a normal name? It's just annoying at this point.
---
They don't want to give the servers time to fill up. They want people sitting in 3 hour queues to see the opportunity to make a new character and start playing on a different realm.
---
Isn’t some of the ability available at Lv1?
---
Yeah me too!
---
Did you do the community center in year one challenge?
---
There will be. Don't sacrifice anything for classic. Its not a sprint to the next phase. Every tier is relevant for every guild the whole way through. You'll find a place for yourself.
---
I'll be hitting up swamp of sorrows and desolace, love those places.
---
I think people REALLY overly fondly remember classic WOW.... it was BAD
---
Although i do feel ninja's are lower forms of life.... i think using a LFG addon defeats the purpose of playing classic. With that being said - do what you must to the plebs who dont want to build the community. (yes, i said it - LFG and LFR killed the community base)
---
Can't wait to wipe your blood off my hooves with your dress &lt;3
---
correct Ramzelle!
---
I appreciate your apology.
---
I guess I value asking the patron for one beer and starting the interaction earlier and more organically without having any part of it being automated. You and I must just have different opinions.
---

Thrall will always be the true Warchief to me.
---
FOR THE HORDE!!
---
LOK'TAR OGAR!!
---
Yeah people going crazy about this addon for no reason. I had a smell it would happen at some point anyway from the beginning there are nazis telling us how to play, not to use questie or rush the game. Also repeating blindly what their favorite streamers say. In the end this addon is not game breaker and it's just a drama whining.
---
You will get used to warrior stances pretty quickly, especially when you start with level 1 and then level up all the way to 60. Basically each stance has advantages and disadvantages and some abilities can only be used while in a certain stance. For example berserker rage can only be used while in berserker stance. In PvP a lot stance dancing can be used depending on the situation and who you are up against, but it's all situational and you learn how to use your stances naturally while you level up your warrior.
---
Holy shit this has to go
---
Nobody cares.
---
So, the time zone chosen is the one that surrendered in WW2. That’s bullshit IMO
---
What the fuck why does eu get all the good server names?
---
The us ones sound dumb as hell.
---
"See all of you, and roughly 900 others, in this same spot"
---
You can buy battlenet or paypal gift cards to redeem depending on availability where you are.
---
Danes moved twice, Gehennas was chosen by a large part of the community for a short while.
---
Like thats exacly how it works zoomer
---
As much as “old school” MMOs were hard core there was always a spot for casuals to find and do something even its only for a few hours a week. Ya maybe you won’t be able to raid but maybe something like a little farming or running some quests will do. You will have a place for sure!
---
hence this post - kinda encourage others to now abuse the addon to be a ninja. So either dont use it, or dont be suprised now that the idea of being a ninja is easier using this addon.
---
fighting fire w/ fire so to speak....
---
In response to your edit: I scheduled surgery for the 28th as it was the first available date. My recovery will be at least 2 weeks depending how well I heal. I have a bed tray laptop desk set up so I can play that first week I'm on bedrest while I'm not knocked out by painkillers. WoW Classic is going to be something to look forward to &amp; keep my mind off any pain. 🙂
---
Okay fuck other realm, I am going cat realm
---
10/10 for song choice
---
It will.
---
Yup!
---
you let him live in your head rent free hahaha
---
Hate to sound dumb but what is VC?
---
I like the addon. It auto invites, but it just invites everyone who whispers, so in a sense the invite is random and not based on rules(mmr).
---
For the people that are saying that it checks talents and people with custom talent builds will be ignored, it will be the same even without that functionality, I mean one can always inspect talents tree and kick, no ?
---
I don't get it how some prefer to read the pile of spam in the chat and whisper spam copy pasted message for invite. 
---
Clean looking UI addon that shows list of hosted groups to me is way better, than non stop reading the spam and whisper to everyone the same ***"Hey I am Holy Priest and have XP on this dungeon invite me ?" .***
---
Let's be honest people will always inspect talents, gear and check for experience somehow. This addon just makes the boring part of finding a group way faster and optimizes time.
---
Mages are self-sufficient, they can level and farm gold really well. They are great end game, you will always be wanted in group play because of AoE, Polymorph, and Conjure Food/Water. They are fun to play with more than one viable spec, they are solid in pvp and pve. You can go a massive burst spec or a strong kiting spec etc. There is no raid tier where you aren't strong. You may not be the best in some areas, but you are strong in all areas and probably the best AoE there is... After a tank and healer my most wanted DPS is always mage for the water, poly, and aoe.
---
No ones gonna let a hunter get auto-added to their dungeon lmao
---
They need to coax the massively alliance dominated pagle people over to west fall.
---
You know mods like this existed in vanilla right?  For a period of time at least.  They removed the functionality at some point, I think it's when lfg stopped being a global channel.
---
I think it's fine, with some big caveats that I explain below, the big difference is that there's no ilvl.
---
I dont like that you can see talent points though.
---
As long as the addon provides no additional information that you wouldn't get by shift clicking their name, I am okay with it in principle.  All it does is provide a GUI for all the "lfm wc" spam in the LFG channel.
---
I kinda dont like auto invite, but I have a feeling most people wouldnt use it so they have more control over the classes they do invite.
---
Ideally, a perfect addon would just parse chat from the LFG channel and provide a GUI for available groups, looking for keywords like "lfm", "lf#m", "lfg", etc.  That way people without the app aren't excluded from a pool of potential groups that are forming.
---
Not anymore, he announced on Classicast today he is going Horde shaman
---
What is that in Murica time. Specifically Texas. CST, not that mountain garbage.
---
***whooosh***
---
Do you have patch notes for the meeting stones working the way you describe in vanilla? If i recall the lfg in the meeting stone was added in BC? I could be wrong.  
---
Edit:  
---
In Patch 2.0.1, Meeting Stones were reworked with the implementation of the new LFG system.   
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Meeting_Stone
---
If it takes about 240 hours for the average player to hit 60, I hope to be there by this time next year. I don’t even have a family, just work, gf, and a tiny social life.
---
So your go-to is to change the subject matter, gotcha.  
---
"His vanilla experience differs from mine, BLASPHEMY!"  
---
  
---
You got proven wrong on so many points, and still try to take the highroad.  
---
I couldn't care less what streamers think, just like you; I care about my vanilla experience (like how i remember it from 2004-2005). 
---
And to go off-topic like you; i never used macro's while playing rogue, but i do not go on campaign against those that did.  
---
I also never used a Auctionhouse addon, sooo... Ban them?  
---
Do we want #nochange or #somechange (skeletons removed, reeeee?)
---
Fuck and I can't kick this stupid cold cough shit that I have going on. I just want to be well again so I can play WoW!
---
...imagine being on every server black list before the game even launches.
---
So does experience and age, NO PEOPLE WHO'VE PLAYED CLASSIC IS ALLOWED TO PLAY CLASSIC
---
Ping is the time it takes to send and receive information packets from the server. A lower ping means that if everyone presses the button at the same time then people with lower ping would have their requests processed first.
---
Great News!!
---
Looks like I am moving servers on the 26th
---
Qfuckingq
---
It isnt 2005 and this isn't vanilla
---
a bunch of crybabies don’t like the fact a mean person made the original comic
---
wtf I love this add on
---
 now.
---
Seriously, I'm going to use it just to cause people like you more butthurt.
---
Hmm only a rare. Thats not cool. Wonder why they didnt make it atleast an epic rarity
---
Speaking from my experience. I did 40hours straight at Legion launch (Surumar kept me going past max level), but only needed about 20hours for BFA. I am planning another 36-40 hours for Classic launch.
---
Skipping a nights sleep I would recommend the following. Doing this has let me skip a night with no ill effects and sleep soundly the night after.
---
Food - I like high protein meals during the run. Some of my favourites are fish curry, sliced steak, seasoned chicken, steamed vegetables. I'm not the healthiest guy but it's important to look after yourself if you are going to be doing this. I snack on bannanas exclusively, would eat around six plus meals over the 40 hours. Vitamin C, Magnesium and Potassium, bannanas are the perfect snack for this.
---
Drinks - Water and black coffee, no sugar. I'll drink 1 ltr of water every 3 hours and follow it with a cup of coffee. No soft drink, no sugar.
---
Excercise - Take a few minutes extra during bathroom breaks. Do some squats, pushups or just walk around the house. With the water intake you'll be at the bathroom every hour or two so a great time to get the body moving an heart rate up for a bit.
---
Plenty of us 30+ people with full time jobs, families, and so on, who still want to do content. I'm leveling with a pair of newbies taking it slow and fun, and not planning on hardcore raiding anymore. But I have the skills to be available as a backup healer or alt runs healer in some guild, eventually. Having a full 40 man is a lot of work, you'll have your core raiders (and in a hardcore guild, that is pretty much everyone), but you'll also have some set of alternate people who play somewhat frequently but maybe not enough to be committed to raiding 3 nights a week.
---
Actually serious, is ML back?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lZlQNsbmeE
---
are you old enough to be on the computer without supervision?
---
The fact that the user interface is much better, the fact that Discord bots are a thing and you can pretty much code one that can even improve the user experience while LFGs.
---
Also, in theory, a server like that would have like minded players so you would have less players but you are pretty much sure they want to group up.
---
My point is, this add-on is not destroying social interaction. Players are still from the same realm and have to walk to the dungeon. 
---
If all things, a Disc server could even make it worse since most people nicknames on discord aren't even related to their character, and so knowing someone reputation there can be harder, specially bad ones.
---
I think this is just an overreaction, which I totally get since classic is a dream come true for many players.
---
No, I want to bring utility. An extra innervate, battle rez, leader of the pack, and the ability to off tank are things that other classes can't do. Windfury totems and a reliable chance to proc Nightfall is something other classes aren't bringing. A shadow priest can come and increase all the shadow damage in the raid. It's a niche for a reason.
---
Cringepilled post.
---
All of them. I like being able to use different spells at different times based on just the need for the spell. I don’t like the mindless “build then spend” functionality.
---
I guess you got a point there but from this numbers I’m expect not many ppl will not get head of you by much . 
---
Taking a week off and only getting to play 30min -3hour a day won’t get you that far ahead , while if you take a week off and no downtime that 8-10hour a day easily
---
Eleven Humble Pies! ( For Jay )
---
I'm sorta hoping I forgot enough over the years I can experience some of it for the first time again.
---
It's most of why I'm going to play horde this time around, as I did much less of it at release.
---
I know - let me quote some random person "Qfuckingq"...... lawls
---
Herod is terrible tbh.
---
Atiesh , Bloodsail Buccaneers, Myzrael and whitemane are all superior names.
---
It was up for discussion. Never moved there.
---
I agree!!!
---
Doesn't that exactly make him "The Developer", though? Atleast to me.
---
:D
---
Of course it won't be the same
---
As a 12 year old jumping into wow I thought stamina stat literally made my char run faster and so I got as much of it as I could
---
Yet you cared enough to post, kid.
---
This is the only change that happens to the stones in TBC. The rework is the summoning ability to them.
---
 In [Patch 2.0.1](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.1), Meeting Stones were reworked with the implementation of the new [LFG system](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Looking_For_Group). They now are used to summon party members to the stone near an instance 
---
📷/📷 [**Patch 2.0.1**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1) **(05-Dec-2006):** Meeting Stones now function similar to a Warlock Summon spell.  
---
The LFG system is in vanilla as you can see here are some modfications to it in 1.7 that clearly show it was LFG. It was in the game far before this however as evidenced in 1.3 and 1.5.  
---
 📷 [**Patch 1.7.0**](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.7.0) **(2005-09-22):**
---
* You will no longer be kicked from the meeting stone queue when a player declines a group invite or when inviting someone that is already in a group.
---
* You will now be informed that you have left the meeting stone queue when the group leader logs out.
---
* Tanks and Healers will now be immediately added to the group by the meeting stone when they are the 5th member of the group.
---
* You can now be added to a group by the meeting stone when that group contains characters that have disconnected.
---
Agreed, if they let this friggin LFG Addon go through the community is going to riot.
---
It needs to be disabled ASAP.
---
Nah man I gotta level up fast before I get over whelmed by the orcs
---
Do people have like, at least some amount of respect for shadow priests? Or are you just constantly flamed for not being holy?
---
I assume [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Warcraft-60-Day-Sub-Card-Activision-Blizzard-PC-Software-020626723053/3308530) is the card you're talking about. Yes, I can buy that easily at any store (which I expected to be doing anyway).
---
So you're saying that this card will also let me *create* a new account (not just add time to an existing account)?
---
Or is it that account creation is a free-for-all nowadays which requires no purchase whatsoever?
---
Parises time zone extends beyond the country.
---
I did! It's probably not gonna be my main though!
---
Wow. Machinima made in WoW. It's like I'm in back in 2006. Next thing you know Nyhm is going to have a new song out and Druid Boy is gonna get a remaster.
---
27th of August happens to be my birthday and for years I've let it slide as just another day. Not this year. I'm planning on teaming up with my friend that I've invited over to my place for some old school back to back WoW session that will last well above 12 hours. Over the next few days the plan is basically to get things in order, clean up the place, stock up on water/snacks, basically do the "chores", make a primitive leveling plan, discuss the many details with my friend while waiting for the servers to go live. I am considering recording the whole thing, not for youtube, but because I wish I had my original Vanilla footage of myself all those years ago. Also I'll try to wake up deep in the PM on Monday (EU), so I'm rested and battle ready.
---
the skull face, which is the coolest face that's ever been in the game and I'm still pissed they don't have one like it in the modern revamps
---
There is no way around this. The way people communicate on the internet in 2019 is different than it was in 2005. There is literally no way to capture the same type of community that the game had at that point because it doesn't exist in the same context. If you're not going to accept that and just let it be a part of Classic you're going to have a bad time.
---
It won't ever be the same. But it's as close as you'll ever get.
---
Just ignore it and play the game you remember. I'm sure you'll meet some friends who feel similarly.
---
Your entire server wasn't sitting inside of Vent/TS. There's thousands of people in each server's Discord before launch.
---
TD = The Deadmines
---
People won't care. Classic is now broken. Tier 1 and 2 have been nerfed to the ground and people are now going to LFG pug them. Guilds won't be needed until AQ and by that time the game community will be destroyed just like modern WoW. Retarded meme kids from twitch. The dream is dead. 16 debuffs in tier 1 and 2, itemization we warned them about, 1.12 talent trees which boost the hell out of some classes dps and patches that boost threat  were all horrible decisions. A LFG is the icing on the top. This abomination is so far from what real Vanilla Tier 1 and 2 is that you are going to see tanks with 2 handers right off the bat.
---
Blizzard also f'd up pvp breaking one of 3 BG's beyond repair by using 1.12 AV. Classic has been broken before it releases.
---
The blood sausage one in Lock Modan was pretty bad. I started doing all of the quests along the west side of the area while killing every bear/boar/spider I found along the way. Finished all of the quests and I wasn't even half way done with the sausage quest. Que me spending more than an hour running around looking for freaking boars and spiders.
---
Yeah.. good luck finding a raid without threat meter or dbm... I don't believe a word you said. And as I said before, most people did not have addons back then... most people did their acomplishments without then. Hf on the streamers server
---
All these memes about trying to pick preset features on WoW toons. Tell me about it after you've tried to create a Sim!
---
i've never heard it called vc but i imagine VanCleef the deadmine's boss to distinguish deadmines from dire maul and still have an acronym
---
Nah
---
any tank / healer can easily get into pugs.
---
Ah good, my new Ambush macro
---
Mograine, here i come!
---
I almost got hit by a car on a walk today lmao
---
Lowkey thought about this after
---
your the leader, you set the addon for dungeon BRD and LFM
---
I set the addon for auto invite for BRD
---
when we both activate the addon - it will insta form our party. you just insta invited a ninja to your party...
---
New realms open on 26th, so just make a new char there with your name.
---
Neither will this addon because it doesn't enable cross realm. Keep tunneling
---
Where are you seeing balance numbers?
---
I feel like if I just block every anti lfg addon person I see from now until release by Monday I'll have blocked 99% of the idiots on this sub.
---
I think a lot of people simply don't remember vanilla.  There was an addon almost exactly like this back then for a significant period of time.
---
Cost is hardly a factor, cloud server processing isn't that expensive. It's about making the game playable.
---
With blizzlike timelines it should be 3-4 months before phase 2, mind you they are not waiting until phase 2 to remove layering, it will be done as soon as it makes sense, but phase 2 is the very last call for layering to be removed, since the game does not function in phase 2 with layering activated.
---
Our first batch was shit compared to NA ones. And this time around your got Bigglesworth.
---
If you make a video on the creation process you'll get 1000 upvotes
---
This does happen.  I healed back in classic.  I often got a tank who had no idea how to read when I went OOM.  I could usually hop up and make the save but that usually left me in worse shape and if he did it again.
---
Hunter pet out of control usually ends in a wipe.
---
Bad rogues that pull aggro let die and hope they learn.  If they get pissed my group usually slapped them down without me saying a word
---
People don't even know what they're mad at...
---
[Literally the only "must-have" addon imo, all the others are just nice](https://i.imgur.com/qbNCs1l.jpg)
---
 
---
&gt;Features that are included.  
---
&gt;**Creating Groups**  
---
&gt;Groups created using ClassicLFG are visible to all players using it on the Realm.  
---
&gt;When looking for people it will periodically write in a public channel of your choice to make people without the Addon aware of the group.  
---
&gt;**Looking for Groups**  
---
&gt;You can look for groups for any dungeon, but there is also a "Custom" category for world events and more.  
---
&gt;The Addon automatically parses all chat messages and lists them as groups to queue up (even across layers!) Note: If you apply for such a group it will whisper the leader of the group with the message that you provide  
---
&gt;Multiple dungeons can be selected at a time  
---
&gt;Groups of which the leader is on your ignore list will not show up  
---
&gt;Features that will NOT be included:  
---
&gt;Automatic group matchmaking  
---
&gt;ILvL restrictions to groups
---
All next two years*
---
I hope Blizz steps in and do something about that. I want trade channels for talking to people, not filled with addon bot spam.
---
That hardly matters really
---
Not a quest, but I gotta bitch about this: Didn't miss a BWL raid for 8 months straight (raided every week) before crossbow of smiting dropped. I had so much DKP accumulated while I waited.
---
Raging little furrys. just how we know the Horde
---
Exactlt why im rolling a feral tank. Brb making any group i want anytime.  Reserving gear. Yup gonna ball out
---
I heard them say we've reached Kalimdor. I'm sure they'll let us go!
---
Old Blanchy IMO.
---
Why not just *not* restrict the premade group finder feature from retail then? Might as well since it's already here
---
People *will* advocate for this. See where this ends?
---
No need to mash those fingers like that. My post was relevant to your garbage API argument. Proven wrong? What are you 12?
---
Calm down. Take a deep breath. This addon isn't going to be around because it goes against the very thing Ion talked about. That's a fact. 
---
Unless you tell me you're Ion, nobody really gives a fuck what kind of API exists or existed. They have taken down addons before because of reasons like this.
---
Salty scorpid blood from 1k needles. Took me 6 hours of grinding scorpids to get that fucking drop.
---
I wonder why Blizzard didn't give a grace period for people that already had a character on another realm. I think that would be an easy way to promote movement away from full servers.
---
Priceless
---
That is not what I remotely said. But it seems you have already made up your mind and put words in my mouth. You are not taking any sort of nuance into the equation and understanding there is a distinct difference between the spirit of vanilla wow and vanilla wow. This goes against the prior which again blizzard has stated their primary goal is keeping that intact. This addon goes against that as long as the auto invite feature is implemented.
---
That's some 300/300 tailoring right there!
---
not like this...
---
What an absolute **FUCKING JOKE**
---
Are you serious with this shit Blizzard? 6 days after both EST PvP servers were full with "severe queues" you're adding one more, in the middle of a work day, *right before the population more than doubles*
---
LFM Deadmines
---
have you tried turning it on?
---
You're right. Hell, Blizzard also won't be able to stop people from buying gold through discord so  they should just ignore Chinese gold sellers too!
---
came to the thread specifically for someone getting butthurt a stonetoss template was used.
---
Brexit to Mograine bois LETS GO. Time to fucking wreck a server economy.
---
what's the difference between auto inviting and auto vendoring grays
---
Omg I cant stand how much i love this because its annoyingly 100% true.
---
GET A LIFE
---
Why would several countries align themselves with Charles the Bald. You could choose east Francia ...Germany, or England. Both which had more significant historical impact. But y’all choose central Francia ... they couldn’t buy a win in the 950-1200’s. Just laughable.
---
I selected gear based on how it looked for awhile on my rogue, my rogue was in tons of int gear.
---
"We don't want to reproduce the actual launch experience"
---
If you turn on autoinvite, stuff like this can put completely unviable groups together too. Especially in the (likely, IMO) case that Blizzard breaks the talent-reading functionality.
---
These, for starters:

People called it VC for the quest to kill Van Cleef, before even knowing what dungeons were. The name VC stuck.
---
What movie is this? Because that’s the same character from Aladdin when he’s in the dungeon. I know Disney likes to reuse old characters like this.
---
Thanks so much mate, it’s been so nice to hear from a large amount of new listeners getting in touch. Thanks so much for giving the show a chance and I’m so glad you’re enjoying it. I wish you nothing but the best of luck on launch, have a blast and Countdown will always be there for you should you choose to ride along with us through the journey :)
---
You don't "talk your way into a group" in vanilla. I don't know if you've played back then, but it's more like "wait in capital and spam macros your way into a dungeon".  
---
This add-on is great. This is what LFG should've looked like.
---
Yeah and they boned the game. Most of these things are in Retail... can you name one that doesnt give you an edge and explain why it would not? 
---
Im gonna use them all if we can not do something about it. I will still like Classic, but I would love to see them removed. I think it would be good for everybody
---
I would say paladin because of the blessings buffs. Also you picked the wrong side to fight for and because of that they have bubble hearth to save you. 
---
Cheers for now, but come monday - die alliance scum
---
Let’s see..it’ll be a Monday. So I’m going to work until 10pm. On my way home, I’m gonna grab McDonald’s likely. Come home and be ready to go for about 4-6 hours.
---
Plot twist: my wife will be home with both of our computers ready to go and already have us queued up at release. She has never played so I’m lucky to have a wingman so game. 
---
Advice: light stretches every hour at least. Every 20 minutes/flight/loading screen, try to stare at something at least twenty feet away for twenty seconds. This will help eye strain and headaches. 
---
Drink plenty of water and pee when you have to.
---
Jesus
---
I have 6 characters on whitemane reserved. I think Bigglesworth is going to be my home though.
---
What is this obsession of names, just use an original name and you don't have any problems
---
I remember my girlfriend at the time couldn't grasp that they had 4 hooves but none of them dropped!  Complete noob.  My wife now wouldn't understand it either tbh.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Give people time to consider the move, be more enticing as servers with no queue (for how long who knows) on launch.
---
I hear Prot wars are a high demand especially at max level.
---
Ughhhh I wish it was east coastttt..how bad can latency be lol
---
Sure, still doesnt change the fact that in 5 mans no one care of your class is the highest damage if you need almost any type of gear.
---
I would prefer this. Would have been so damn rad to see ravaged undead high elves ALA what human forsaken look like.
---
Was 100% going to but since they fucked me by opening it on Monday afternoon for some reason there's no way to get names
---
It's not the about the communication, it's about the automation. 
---
If you automate with a third party tool you're botting and you will get banned.  
---
If you communicate with a third party tool nobody gives a damn.
---
Something interesting I just realised on the number of reply on the survey:
---
Pagle : 1044	
---
Mankrik : 715
---
Both of them are ''full'' but Stalagg is at 3251 (the highest in NA) but ingame the server is at ''high''
---
So I suspect these servey to be quite far from reality. The A/H ratio should be taken with a grain of salt. Considering mostly only reddit user do these survey and the average player is not going to know Pagle = Alliance name and Mankrik = Horde name.
---
So your issue with gearscore is not the system itself but that raidleaders have exceeding gear demands for content that can be cleared without? 
---
Do you think that's something unique to gear score? Because you see the exact same thing on for example pservers where people need prebis in order to join a moltencore group. What do you think about that?
---
Awesome! Will any download link from the willitclassic website work?
---
🤢🤢🤢
---
I cared enough to let you know that no one cares.
---
I win.
---
I read on here before that Alliance quests are better because they were made first and Horde quests were rushed before release. I dont have a source though
---
&gt; rather than people opinions
---
But that's the whole point of creating a thread vs. just Googling it.
---
If players are forced to use a third party site, they are far less likely to use a classicLFG tool. Who wants to minimize and shit just to put together a group
---
I could see something like Oqueue come back, which would be pretty cool to have around imo
---
After some of the turbonerds I met while I played Eve when I quit playing WoW.
---
151 total bank alts doesn't seem out of the question.
---
It also taught me to be the one that stockpiles stuff ahead of time to try and profit during buyouts for the war effort.
---
The real question is, can we still ring the gong right before downtime (is there going to be downtime with classic?) to piss off all the people who were complaining that it had to be done at a convenient time for everyone?
---
That shitshow on Ysera was a lot of fun to be a part of.
---
No it wasnt. It was wrath that did that. Prior to wrath dungeon finder you could have any number of group finder setups on realms. Most were outside of the game, but you still had to interact with people and have to maintain a reputation.
---
People need to understand that no matter how hard they try, this isn't going to completely replicate the old Vanilla feel. It's a different era with different technologies and knowledge available.
---
Now quit shitting in other people's cereal and enjoy the game the way you want to play it and relive the good old days before reality slaps you in the face and drags you back into it kicking and screaming.
---

Because they've made a decision on it. I think its going to be difficult to get them to pick another solution for what is a relatively minor issues in their eyes. Not impossible ofc, but to quote myself here, "probably not gonna happen though".

Have fun running countless messy pugs :)

Welcome to the Patrick Stewart panel at your local sci-fi convention line that stretches across city blocks experience. Today's guest: Herod
---
Except you get into the panel and see that general chat is talking about anal warts just like on every other server
---
No absolutely not. Because a players value is more than their the gear they have, it’s their skill too.
---

---
I used to have a bit of a mix. Benny benassi, korn, MSI, i think some grunge maybe silverchair, nirvana, and maybe like blueberry by luda....i was just getting into smoking so as u can see vanilla is an important part of my life..wait what are we talking about again?
---
Depends on the name I suppose
---
Pretty sure they said the Bindings are on the MC drop table in the AMA. Whether the quest is available is another matter.
---
Id 100% agree with you in a guild dungeon run or with friends. In a pug the goal is to get you gear not some random i probably wont play with much of ever.
---
It has nothing to do with banning the addon, but breaking the addon lua so that such automation addons cannot work.
---
As a warrior is it worth taking tailoring to make 6 slot bags and the drop it?
---
Alliance on Lightninghoof and The Forgotten Coast as well
---
CTA could also probably run fine without automatically pushing messages to chat. Hooking to CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL to be able to *look* at chat channel messages is the important one.
---
Dog, we full
---
Thank christ. Blaumeux was a terrible server name.
---
I don't know how it'll turn out, obviously, but I'd be a little careful with making assumptions about how people will act based on private servers and the beta. Both of those attracted mainly vanilla WoW enthusiasts whereas Classic will be open to the entire WoW community, and the modern WoW community is kinda shitty on the whole.
---
Going to be good for casual players.  A lot of guilds are entrenched on whatever server they have chosen so the new realms will be for people who do not care about that and would rather be able to log in straight away on release.
---
I just want all of my bags to open at once is that so wrong
---
Edwin VanCleef.
---
Dwarf too. Good choice :)
---
Have to agree with you here... these names are terrible
---
Edit: west coast names* to be clear, east coast and Europe got some awesome names

---
Or people can find enjoyment in different ways than you?
---
Also personally i paid a month sub just to get the name so why waste the money on some peasant name?
---
This. What I take this to mean is that there are SO many Alliance on Pagle that they actually need to thin it out with 2 more Alliance named servers.
---
Based on the comments here and the blue post I think Bigglesworth will be popular.
---
I played vanilla and I can tell you back then nobody actually used addons like these. They may have existed, but it wasn’t the meta.
---
Shamans don't have bloodlust
---
"You'll never defeat the brotherhood."  
---
"Fools, our cause is righteous."
---
Is this a confusing perspective? Would if he there from the harbor ?
---
I do remember thottbot but if you honestly think that thottbott is equivalent to the wealth of resources players have today I really do not know what to say. 
---
It is a bit more than speculation since it has happened in retail, once something is introduced and becomes the social meta it does permanent damage to the game, rather not repeat the same mistakes.
---
Yes now it only does the invite, but it is the precedence of automating things. It creates harmful dynamics just to appease people who do not want to be social in a mmo.
---
Okay but you know that people still ask for gear requirements in pugs right? You are expected to show up for an inspect at IF bridge or org top of bank. 
---
How is it any different?
---
Guess you missed all the other posts about this?????
---
People wanting cool server names and I'm just sitting here thinking about rolling on Ol' Dirty Blanchy.
---
You’re right, that struggle WAS one of the best parts!  Because at the end of it you actually had a sense of accomplishment.  I’ll never forget my guilds first clear of UBRS.  We were so undergeared, and wiped more times than I care to remember.  But eventually, we prevailed.  I had goosebumps, shaking, the whole thing.  Probably my favorite gaming moment of my life.
---
Lfd wasn't so bad in the beginning. It was server local - so no randos you'd never see again, you still had to travel to the dungeon, summon people, etc.
---
Especially when you’re trying to make it quick and save your name...
---
This is unacceptable!
---
Same here. Our guild is fairly small (30-40 people) that are quite casual, so not everyone checks forums / discord etc. We already announced Arugal, it would cause quite some issues with organizing everyone to another realm. So we'll probably stay here.
---
For key binds, I just go into the settings in the game

Does Classic have talent inspection? It was added in 2.3.
---
If these addons become prevalent it’s gunna be a pass for me on classic . Hoping it doesn’t
---
The addon may have existed in vanilla, but no, it wasn’t in vanilla. Nobody used this. I’ve played vanilla and never saw anyone using this.
---
I don't think most people that are super engaged with classic on this subreddit are going to take 200 hours to get there. That's the average, keep in mind the average are probably most people not super engaged with the game.
---
No, it won’t I promise you.
---
What other people do will not impact my enjoyment of the game.

When the private servers start leaking in....

Different servers called it different things in vanilla.

Yeah, I guess it depends what community you’re in. Uh I’d think there will be a good amount of prot wars. I hear from PVE stand point if your a war you’re a tank. So I mean maybe easier to stick out as a healer but ideally which ever one you enjoy more would be the choice since they are all good options.
---
How is that any different from lf1m need tank, lf2m need healer and dps?
---
Likewise, OP I think wants to set them up early. He was asking about a config file he could setup before he launched the game. I could be wrong.
---
[This](https://classicwow.live/guides/992/classic-wow-addon-guide-how-to-find-install-and-update-addons-my-addon-list) is a good start, it also contains resources for other addon websites that should work on 1.13.
---
look at the 2nd screenshot auto invite is not there
---
You will probably need to have logged in for #1. Your account folder is like this:
---
World of warcraft -&gt; _ classic _ -&gt; WTF -&gt; Account -&gt; [Random numbers] -&gt; bindings-cache.wtf 
---
If you have no logged in yet, then those numbers that determine your account aren't there and I have no idea what they represent but it's basically a way of masking your username. 
---
You could make a bindings file and then put it in after you have played for a second, and then restart the game though. 
---
 You do not need to log into mail alts.
---
I can hear the human male "Nyuuuh!" noise as he crits you.

I'm pretty sure I checked and the willitclassic links are all good. When in doubt try to find out the main site it gets posted to
---
Unless I was unaware at the time, Teamspeak and vent were pretty much used by guilds only, not open to an entire server community with 5000+ members. Back then you had to be logged on and in one of the global chats to find group. With this you don’t even have to be in game. You can get mobile alerts and log on to a group waiting for you!
---
If its not pushing messages, then it can't use it to advertise your group or advertise that you are looking for a group.
---
That would make the addon pretty useless.
---

Are you asking if people want to play on illidan with you or if people that used to play on illidan want to play with you? Don’t think there is a classic server named illidan, they are all brand new server names for classic.
---
Yes exactly. They’ve pruned it down on retail and even during vanilla. Lots of apis were exposed before that shouldn’t have been and lots have been added since as well.
---
Would you say totems even the playing field? Or are the Paladin buffs simply better for dungeons/raids/pvp?
---
im fine with someone deciding your gear is too shit for a group 
---
the last thing i want to see is people spamming 
---
lfm mc (1000gs minimum)
---
this is not how vanilla worked , you talk to people , inspect them 
---
the main problem is as the game gets older the requirements people set get higher and higher making entering the system harder for new players
---
if you have 30 people in decked out gear who just need like 2 things in a raid you can easily take 10 people in mediocre gear especially if they are good players.
---
i dont like itemscore but more than that i dont like how having that encourages people to use it.
---
at least if you talk to the guy he could actually have a lot of experience be in pre bis and know the fights just not have the exact gear you wanted
---
using itemscore you miss out on quality slightly under geared players who need to gear
---
its also a negative for the entire server because it makes it harder for new players to enter the raiding system
---
every server needs new players getting gear to be available to the harder raids
---
I'm curious to see what the classic server blades look like

Agreed, I don't mind any of the gameplay aspects of the faction war. But I've always disliked people being prideful and convincing themselves they're better than others, be it about their country, sports team, or WoW faction.
---
I know it's generally not super serious, but it's still obnoxious to me. I just find verbal conflict tedious, and don't get why people willingly take part in it. 
---
To those who enjoy it, can you explain why? As an autistic person, It's hard to wrap my head around this.
---
Edit: I also don't understand patriotism. You don't get to choose the country you are born in, so why be prideful about it? Mostly seems like indoctrination to me.

im sure it was more commonly referred to as DM, but on Daggerspine-US Horde side in the Vanilla days you saw a lot of people call it VC. I think it changed depending on server and what caught on first

---
It has nothing to do with retail LFD/LFR, the name is missguiding you.
---
Yeah sorry. I just had allot of dumb replies and they got on my nerves. Yeah that's what I mean to say. Yeah today they are required. But that's not the core of my arguement. The core of my arguement is that they monopolise the ability to compete and thereby determining the experiance. The requirement and Retailing Classic are secondairy arguements.
---
Edit: it was dumb of me to say I did not believe you. Instead you could be proof that you used to be able to compete at a high lvl without getting them.
---
You are talking about LFM as in TBC version where you could see groups formed looking for more. RDF was the queued and immediately inside the dungeon crap they brought out in Wrath. I did enjoy wrath but i feel the massive downfall of the community aspect was started with RDF. (and at this moment i realized i said LFG not RDF like an idiot. Apologies)

---
I wouldn't say going fully blind isn't good, but I'd only look up roughly where to go to have a general idea and that would be all
---
What? It is possible. 
---
1. Have a chat specifically for the addon. Users with the addon automatically hide the chat (so it doesn't clog up human readable chats).
---
2. When somebody launches the addon and starts a group, send a non-human readable string to the chat channel. 
---
3. All the other addon users in the channel automatically read the string and their app updates.
---
4. Now that somebody can see all the groups in the channel, they click one to join. This sends another string with some kind of identifier to the chat channel.
---
5. All the addons update again and the one related to that identifier sees the queued person. Boom, two way communication achieved. 
---
6. Auto invites them.
---
Pretty simple. If someone tried to read the chat it'd just be endless scrolling of gibberish that only the app can read (assuming the app had enough users)
---
In this case you go in and need on someone else's upgrade purely out of spite in hopes that you take it from them.
---
Edit: I dont fuck around though. If I'm group lead in a pug, I'll announce that a piece is reserved and when we come up on the piece I'm after, I'll make myself ML just incase. Ain't nobody got time for that.

Depends if they force the que at the start or not. The servers are running around 30k people.  It's also blizzard. Expect the worst.

no thank you
---
Question: if I developed an addon which filtered Twitch chat words, words like gearscore or ilvl, which would you want added?
---
If I can log in and kill a few boars the first day I'll be happy
---
Yeh I just saw a post of people posting that shit. It’s fine, I’m going to be a well geared tank making my own groups.
---
Blizzard! Please ban an entire company!
---
Of course! And walk a close line of trash talking, but making sure you don’t get banned
---
They could, but I doubt that would catch on the same way as a looking for group tool would.
---
I wouldn't be surprised to see it banned though. In retail Blizzard recently banned an add on that allowed you to instantly group up for World Quests (dailies) because it was bypassing what they already had in place (meaning players that were using Blizzard's group finding tool were in a different pool). That and people were grouping for quests that weren't meant to be grouped for so easily, completing them way too quickly.
---
You could argue for this, under the same logic, that a looking for group add on compromises the Classic experience, and hurts players that choose not to use it. If 50% of the population uses the add on, that really hurts people trying to find groups in LFG or general chat and just separates people who do have it and who don't have it.
---
Keep these posts coming, Blizzard needs to know that this sort of crap is not wanted.
---
Don't hurt me, no love:(
---
When did it become controversial to not like lfd in this sub? It does the literal same thing. Trying to justify it on "it was technically possible" just means that you'd think lfd was a good idea had it been released sooner
---
I for one think this addon is complete cancer. I don't care how you think it's "the same" as spamming lfg or how it was possible in 2006, it's a way to create a group and find players through an UI instead of talking to them in the chat, and that's where the discussion *ends*
---
They know what they are doing, stop complaining, who cares about a name, enjoy the queues, im playing on firemaw, blizzard doesnt owe you anything.
---
So the line should be drawn with addons where it will affect the social aspect of the world.  Fair enough.  I wish ClassicLFG didnt exist, but I think there's no way to stop automated grouping in servers with 50k people in them.  If blizz wont let them do it in the game, people will use third party to do it outside the game.  I dont think there's any way to stop this, but I wish there was.
---
 Someone didn't get daddy's dick today.

So is auto-invite and nobody who is actually serious about doing dungeons, etc is going to use it.

It doesn’t reinforce the pick up and forget. It connects those types together.  
---
Why do you insist that others play to your social gaming standards?  It’s narcissistic and borderline fascist mentality.
---
Idk about your server discord, but the Fairbanks one is filled with autistic scrubs who probably arnt gonna reach level 35. So yeah, I’m not gonna help carry them through dungeons

What is this? Bizarro world?

&gt; nobody really gives a fuck what kind of API exists or existed

I do.

Many other do aswell, that was classic.  
---
&gt;This addon isn't going to be around because it goes against the very thing Ion talked about. That's a fact.   
---
He said they would limit them, not remove them.  
---
They literally cannot remove them without removing the entire API for reading chat / channels.  
---
And if they do decide to do that then a massive amount of other addons would be affected aswell, turning it further away from a classic experience.

From what everyone is saying classic will be a marathon rather than a sprint, you should be fine man!
---
You'll have hours of communication after the group is formed. You won't be breezing through the dungeon and not communicating. The way dungeons are listed for people in order to find a group isn't going to rip the fabric of the game apart.
---
So then vanilla was boned from the start? Because all of those addons you listed existed then, or in some form or another.
---
&gt; Im gonna use them all if we can not do something about it.

Then do it. Seriously, you sound like a kid threatening his parents by saying he is going to clean his room if they don't stop him.

Wow, some people read these reddits and drink the kool-aid a wee bit much. There are absolutely good hunters out there and blacklisting an entire class seems kinda like an asshat thing to do when there are easy solutions to pet asspulls (There's this spell called DISMISS PET)

Mages are really impactful with their AOE and CC. I’d say the most impactful is probably a healer like a priest because they can turn the tides if you keep them protected. Personally I prefer to play range in PvP since BG’s like AV are not that fun to play as a melee unless you have a healer.

It's actually opening 24 hours before it launches in Europe, correct?

Sorry to burst your bubble buddy.  Played all through vanilla and TBC with 220+ days played.  Never went past a month on any of the later expansions, skipped panda land and BFA.  I'm back for that sweet sweet vanilla cream.  I'm here for the long haul.
---
You significantly overestimate how difficult dungeons will be. 
---
It will make the game slightly worse and as stated by blizzard automation is against the Spirit of classic. Sure it isnt the end of the world but it does make the game worse according to blizzard.
---
Not like it’s hard to migrate them nowadays
---
This descriptor has been around since way, way back when. Basically, it's very low pop realms that they try to bait new people into filling up, although what usually happened is said new people wound up on a dead realm. 
---
Here, it won't matter though, not for now at least.
---
He speaks for all of us.
---
Warlock male human because I fuck
---
It's a mistake to open them right before launch.
---
Full realms need people to start organizing guilds to transfer *now* so that those realms already have a decent population before launch.
---
Resubbers are NOT new players- they're old players who know what it's like to watch realms fall into low population and die. Very very few people will resub on Monday and join a 'new' or low pop realm because of that fear. They'll rush to the high pop servers, thus defeating the purpose.
---
If they opened them now, it'd give people time to reroll, raise those pop levels, and have a healthy medium or high so when people sub again, they're cool with going there.
---
So what you're saying is we'll never lose? YES.
---
in retail your gear gets completely replaced every patch.
---
“oh, in 8.1 you were a mythic raider and you were farming mythic +10s everyday for good gear? well congratulations in 8.2 you can buy better gear from a manapearl vendor after doing just a few worldquest!”
---
You're the one claiming the automation is the problem not me.  I asked you if this addon without the automation would be fine and you chose not to answer probably because you can't form a coherent argument.  Be real you triggered by the letters lfg.
---
Is that piccolo?

---
I didn’t think it was a big deal I was just excited. My bad.
---
So you’re a LFG addon minus the scripts?
---
Imagine if it were pristine hooves
---
Thank you, you too! I am beyond excited for it, and I lucked out with a girlfriend that is just as excited for it as I am! Hours upon hours of guilt-free playtime. I just can't stand what retail has become. I quit playing near the end of Cataclysm, which was my absolute least favorite WoW experience. I started back up again in Legion, and actually enjoyed a lot of what it had to offer... but I felt so alone the whole time. Pugging groups and raids with the LFG/LFR tools just took away the fun. I was just a number, ilvl x. Nobody talked to each other, there was no community, the faces you saw you would never see again. The gear you earned meant nothing and was too quick to be replaced. I could go on... What little of vanilla I got to experience, TBC, and WOTLK will always be my fondest memories of WoW.
---
I know it's going to sound counter-intuitive given how optimized games are in 2019, but even if you do waste time traveling, on the grand scheme of things it's not going to matter (what I mean is, leveling 1-60 takes a long time, maybe longer than you're anticipating).
---
Discord still requires people to communicate, an LFG addon does not. So, no, we won’t chill out and I hope the addon gets broken.
---
The point I’m trying to make here, is that there are so many things that exist now, that ultimately make many aspects of the game “easier”. No matter what, it is impossible to recreate an experience from 15 years ago. There is far more information available, more tools. 
---
When WoW  launched we didn’t have wowhead, YouTube, twitch, and discord. Addons were not so widely used or known about, and their developers were not as capable as today. Most people probably didn’t have a second monitor (smartphones barely existed as they do now) to look up things they were stuck on.
---
Finding groups will not, and given how connected we are today should not take as long as they did back then. Mankriks wife will be found easily, and raids will be cleared in very little time.
---
Shadow won’t have an issue if you find a guild early.  The raid has 40 slots, very few guilds are filling these up with just the best dps, you’ll need a spriest to buff your warlocks dps by 15%
---
Nah.  They will all function more or less the same way.  They "scrape" the /lookingforgroup chat channel, and they take the most recent message from people that include the name of whatever dungeon you're looking for.  
---
It's basically just a glorified chat filter with a UI.  It doesn't require or discriminate against anyone not using the mod.  
---
If the mod was something different and had its own internal "queue" that it automatically pulled from and required the use of the addon to be in that queue that would be a different story imo.
---
They are very different communities. They have nothing in common, there is no way to meet/party/talk/see or do anything with the other realms. How are they the same community?
---
I use a super secret trick that completely eliminates that problem. 
---
Play a tank.
---
Then you are a pathetic person for not having a problem with a lfg addon, makes me sad

But you're missing the point. If you break this LFG add on. You'll break that add on as well.

To be fair they're having to decide and get everyone else to agree. And considering many won't want to switch after getting their name reserved, that makes it harder. And I don't blame them.

JUST LOCK THE FULL SEVERS INSTEAD PF BEGGING PEOPLE TO NOT GO TO THEM AAAA
---
It really isn't as common as you make it out to be, i played the entirety of vanilla as a hunter main and 4 60 alts that all did dungeons and never once did we need to kick the hunter, all you need to do is ask them to dismiss pet.
---
It’s something they have always done when a new server gets released and is low pop. They try and encourage newer players to roll there. I feel bad because a lot of those new player servers end up becoming pretty dead.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Most people just want you to be able to listen unless you're a crucial role like a tank or healer that needs to call out taunts/healing cooldowns.
---
Probably be a smoother run anyway.
---
I gotta disagree. More non RPers means the RPers get outnumbered and maybe camped or chased off the server. It’s happened in retail enough times that we know it’s a possibility. People “just looking to avoid queues” shouldn’t join BB or Grob. At the bare minimum we need pvpers who want an rp community to stand with and defend; the RP-PvP server isn’t just “an escape from high pops.”
---
I will agree that most people who want to avoid queues will hold out for the server type they really want. If RP doesn’t appeal to them even in their peripheral, they’ll wait for a pvp realm.
---
Good point about the ganking!

~~Magic 8 ball says maybe.~~

~~Voice for dungeon groups is not likely to be expected. Voice for raiding will probably be expected. Voice for raiding is a requirement for most raid guilds, if you don't have to use voice then you will be an exception. I would not raid with a guild that did not require voice for raids.~~
---
I missed the part where you said you could listen. Should not be a problem, most guilds would prefer that non-leaders not say anything.
---
Dire maul is typically cleared by wing (ex. DM:N) so there is no real use in abbreviating it to DM anyway
---
Yep. Found some of my best ingame friends this way. People I'm literally about to roll with in classic. People I went on to do high end raiding with for years after vanilla. We're all in discord every day counting down till launch. There's only 1 difference I would include in classic, and that's viable speca. I'm kinda biased on that though- I played a heals in raids ret pally in vanilla. Had arguably the best gear even for a warrior on the server as ret and couldn't raid with it lol.
---
And when a huge chunk of the server uses it and you can't reliably find a group if you aren't using the addon?
---
Not necessarily. Most game that use these you.just pop into a discord group, and do the run then leave.
---
Rip my pc parts won't arrive until the 30th
---
&gt; ... it doesn't auto-match people, you still have to talk, ask spec/role...
---
(Moments later when someone points out that it *does in fact do this*)
---
&gt; ... I was there, the autor is changing it due to feedback, ...
---
You sound like a totally unbiased actor who provides only empirical evidence to facilitate discussion:
---
&gt; ... crying rivers of tears over something they don't actually understand.
---
Zug zug
---
You won't be able to avoid them because the addon doesn't require other people to have it.  You use the addon and it looks for anyone posting in the lfg channel.  The person making the post doesn't have to be using the addon.
---
I love BRD right now I’m going on Makirk or Mankrik whatever it spelt. I am going to tank so many BRD runs
---
I'm playing Classic as a first timer, my first xpac was Mists, but I was an avid mmo player before that. The LFG addon looks EXACTLY like the way it worked in an MMO called Aion, and it was actually pretty swanky. It always fostered a sense of community for me, b/c you'd always see the same kind of names pop up as you level, you had to interactwith the people you were inviting, there was always a quick convo before the invite and you'd start chatting after. If it works like that, maybe it won't be so bad. If it tries to be more like retail, that's whwn you have an issue.
---
I'M A BOOMER AND BACK IN MY DAY WE CLICKED OUR SPELLS, KEYBOARD TURNED, AND SPAMMED LFG/LFM MACROS IN TRADE FOR HOURS ON END, AND WE LIKED IT THAT WAY!

Fortnite has ruined an entire generation of gamers.
---
Blaumeux is still low so they just change it to new players lmao
---
So what about KTM/Recount type mods then?  Those are pretty significant impacts on community interactions as they can be meters to elitism on DPS flex or basically telling you how to manage threat to the exact point of threat level you have.
---
[it won't](https://i.imgur.com/qbNCs1l.jpg)
---
it doesnt automate anything, just like any other addon, it just gathers information and tidy's it up and presents the data in a useful way
---
Yeah why didn't I think of that? hahaha
---
God damn WHERE WERE YOU EARLIER?!
---
Eastern? I thought you said Weastern.

There is no product you need to buy to play classic. Paying for a subscription is all you need. 
---

---
You know the way to my heart
---
Orc warrior, tanking has been the most involved and fun aspect of wow for me.  Know main tanking is competitive so hopefully I can level him up first and get geared up before too many get established
---
Orc warlock, my old classic main, my dps character and hopefully my pvp focus so orc for the stun resist
---
Troll shaman, figured I'd round out with a healer and I hear shaman are in pretty high demand and low supply.
---
I’m not entirely sure sitting in a virtual city reading a small and constantly updating window with no way to track conversations is “hard work”. 
---
It’s not cross realm lfg, it’s not auto portal to the instance where all the quests are available. It’s a chat tracking tool that can be used for invites. 
---
Using this addon doesn’t make someone lazy. But shade being thrown because someone wants to play differently shows you as being kind of a tool. Fight me.
---
Yeah I don't really know why everyone hates it so much, the premade group finder blizzard added in legion is honestly one of the best things in the game. Being able to search for a group for exactly what you want/make one yourself is a blessing, rather than having to trawl through a bunch of LFG/LFM chat flooding for a bunch of dungeons that you dont want to do
---
Herod would be considered blessed to lick Mograine's boots clean, if he were worthy even for that. Mograine could also smite him with a flick of a finger, pumping out more damage with his basic white auto attacks than Herod has as total health. 
---
That said, Herod is still the Chad server.
---
please farm the kobolds for a fishing rod and 4 bags before you leave the starting zone
---
A good Hpal is extremely impactful. Hpals are the sole reason why Alliance have the upperhand in pvp.
---
Get this addon out of here
---
Okay, you seem reasonable. I've planned playing a Paladin for so long and I already have he and my 2 other characters made. What do I do? I know it's not going to be all doom and gloom. I know that I'll be able to raid as ret. This isn't about me wanting to play Ret. I really don't care one bit to play Holy, and I'll bring extra consumes and doing all the things that make me attractive to raid groups. But, I believe there is some middle ground that I can achieve between being a pseudo priest in a dress and being an epic Holy Knight Chad who strikes fear into his enemies and how into his allies.
---
Someone help me! Lol
---
And I declined every single shitter whispering me with vQueue. Ez clap.
---
Same...but I feel like I'm all ready by now. /shrug
---
if they leveled enough to get into UBRS theyre not quitting in two days...
---
Even Alive's guide has him using Voidwalker w/ associated talents, yet since stress test release, its been proven that the Voidwalker guides were made based upon private servers, and isn't actually a viable option for efficient levelling compared to Imp.
---
I agree that all those guides should be taken with a grain of salt.
---
mmm, sounds like it's time to sheep the kill target.
---
Who do you think is the CEO of Blizzard now? They have no CEO son. Activision pushed him out and hired a guy as "president" who never agreed to make classic and never wanted to make it. The only CEO now is Kotick.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
I mean, I guess if you're playing Horde and gank Nelfs you give them a 50% movement speed buff?
---
Thankfully thankfully thankfully, we are getting cross realm battle grounds. So even on a 100% Alliance server the queues for BGs would be fine.
---
&gt;Uh I’d think there will be a good amount of prot wars. I hear from PVE stand point if your a war you’re a tank. 
---
Nah, Fury was top end DPS once geared. Arms was great for PvP. As far as Classic goes, Warrior was reasonably well rounded.
---
The reality would be more like: If you're a tank you're a Warrior.  Paladin and Druid can't reliably tank anything of merit, just casual runs of farm content.
---
Low.
---
Moved 8 hours away to help my sister after her daughter passed. New job was supposed to start day after release, luckily it's been delayed till 23rd of sep :)
---
Honestly, I never liked those addons. Threat should either be built into the game or not available, but they were a big part of Classic so I would leave them in.
---
It all makes sense now
---
Makes sense. Enjoy
---
heck yes. I am not really a noob but im not a pro at vanilla wow either so i assume i will upset a few people by not knowing everything.
---
I admire your gumption.
---
Paladins are the uncontested pvp healers. Absolutely OP compared to anything else, unless you count resto druids never being caught in the  open.
---
You don't know that. What if tons of new people fall in love with it like we did?
---
Perfectly fine. People that support pedophiles? Not so much.
---
Dude no get that nazi cartoonist the fuck out of here
---
I too want to say very nice job! And also encourage you to do as /u/viktae stated. Wowhead classic database if far superior. Keep it up!
---
That was in reference to how layers work when you log out. 
---
&gt; I’d also like to clarify how multiple layers work with logout. Early in our stress testing, players reported that logging out and back in would let you hop to a new layer to farm the same mineral or herb node on different layers. That was a bug, and we’ve fixed it. Your layer assignment now persists for a few minutes between logouts, long enough that by the time the game would choose a new layer for you, that node would have respawned on its own anyway.
---
Source:https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/q-a-compilation-wow-classic-development-team-ama/260760
---
The delay for switching layers when you get invited to a group was decreased.
---
The addon displaying information regarding talents is an issue and it will be removed, I'm following development through discord, really big deal for you? I can't recognize something as issue, and I can't know it will be fixed?
---
&gt;(Moments later when someone points out that it *does in fact do this*)
---
It doesn't auto-match people, for someone to join a group it either have to click to join a specific group through the addon interface or whisper the party leader. If you think you saw it somewhere you got it wrong. You actually proving my point, crying rivers because you didn't understand something. Saw? It's a good argument, you are my empirical evidence.
---
Sounds like someone is mad that he didn't get his name.
---
The industry did change though
---
Not sure the answer to your question but https://willitclassic.com/ could point you in the right direction.
---
That's probably a good plan! Finally supposed to be decent weather around where I'm at, maybe I'll try and do the same :)
---
But people specifically subbed for name reservation...
---
Making yourself look stupid? Thinking people calling you a noob is pissing them off. Man I can only imagine your personality irl
---
y tho?
---
Rural ER?
---
That would probably be illegal considering people paid to reserve their name
---
No? I’ll already be geared, I won’t need 99% of the tank drops. I enjoy speed running instances and being the super hero of the group, that’s why I’m going tank. 
---
I’m a giver, and a helper. I like helping people, but it’s a secondary benefit of flexing my skill and gear, and enjoying my character. I’ve always been the type of player to speed level and help people out.
---
This just came back to mind but my early days of vanilla I had a guy run me through rfc like 5 times and give me like 50g when I was only like lvl 20. It was nothing to him but the world to me, that’s how I am in real life and in game, probably because of that guy.
---
This is pretty good and definitely inline with what I was doing in preparation as well. Not too many people running human lock so there isn't much to compare out there. Eastvale at 8 is definitely worth it and a great tip. Some good mobs to grind are the wolf camps and human camps west of Goldshire because they aren't contested.
---
Do you feel it's worth it to route princess later on with the VW quest?
---
Not particularly less convenient though and it wouldn't require you to download an add-on to do it. You'd just click the "invite to group" button, paste it into a chat channel in-game and you're done.
---
Ah ah gentleman of taste. I too was a Shadowsong hero in my day

None. Going in raw.

**Edit to add.**
---
Horde out number alliance, so alliance have faster BG queue's
---
Or those who use binds, or add ons at all?
---
There's so much shit against the "spirit" of Vanilla. 
---
I barely understood add ons back then. I was 14. I was able to install a clock mod(yeah there was no in game clock).
---
That's it. From my experience DBM, Gatherer, any UI mods, and meters are against the spirit of the game as it was. Other people are talking about experiences with mods functionally similar to this.
---
Auto invite is bad how? If you want to auto invite the 3 ret pallies that message you go ahead. I doubt auto invite will be used much but people that know wha they’re doing.
---
You're right! I didn't even think about that. That might even result in a lead for the Alliance in PVP rankings.
---
I agree, great help all here and everything but holy cow. I am noob to ubuntu and have been nervous about getting classic going and now I see why. Gonna need a while to get this all correct and running (I hope). It's Battlenet that looks like the tricky part, idk. Currently running tbc and was running lights hope just fine, but this is cray

I don't understand what's bad here.  The brief exchange of whispers before joining a group is hardly what anyone can call a social experience.  The full extend of social interaction this addon removes is someone typing "LFG healer UBRS" in LFG chat followed by somebody whispering "I'll go."
---
so you are hot then, good

Yeah good luck on Drakkisath or Berserk bosses mate

Haha, it seems like some folks at Blizz watched Esfand's stream a couple days ago. He pointed out the discrepancy in realm population due to how incredibly shitty some realm names were compared to "Herod", and right after, Blizz announces new realms with both badass names and names so shitty they're ironically awesome.
---
Esfand literally mentioned "Old Blanchy" as an example of a shit realm name in his stream lol:

You wouldn't happen to know of a list of the other 6 unique mounts, would you?
---
Alliance supposedly has the edge on pve and pvp at a really high level. Paladins are BIS for all organised content.
---
However, Horde typically draws a more competitive player base. This is just a generalization though.

Uh no. It won't be hard and what people will do is bring a core of like 20 and sell carries to idiots that want trash gear. Example. Mage tier 1 which is useless. That dps class is also fool proof. The "carry" will contribute pressing one button.

This is great news...but I wish I hadn't resubscribed just to reserve my name on the 12th. :p

I didn'n know you could sell your grey stuff to npc.

And to be honnest, we (my brother and myself) found the AH BEFORE noticing we could sell stuff to npc.

All servers are basically 50/50. Polls from this subreddit and from discord show a bit more horde but that could be because this sub and discord are for more hardcore players who want to min-max and therefore choose horde sine they are generally better for PvP.

He just explained how it's not arbitrary.

No one is going to use this stuff anyways, gearscore never caught on on private servers at least in my experience, and private servers are generally pretty progressive with addons.

It worked for the pve realm Dalaran. We were dead as hell but after having the new player tag for most of Draenor, ended up a high pop realm in Legion.

I suck with computers and I heard that Macs last so I'm going for durability over performance.
---
The "experience" is just playing the game and figuring out how to do stuff better as you go. If you think westfall is iconic and you want to play it, play it. There is no "middle ground" leveling guide, because that's not what a leveling guide is.
---
updated pvp gear from the start turns stage 2 into a bloodbath, casuals have been led to believe pvp is the "real" server type and a lot of them are gonna get farmed into quitting.
---
melee leeway and spell batching are crazy overtuned--  claim it's authentic and you make the game feel clumsy and bad.
---
armored mounts aren't in the game and the only excuse is ridiculously flimsy, guess what's going in the shop.
---
...and so on
---
&gt;Wow, some people read these reddits and drink the kool-aid a wee bit much.
---
Or, you know, they've had years of experience dealing with Hunters who, despite playing the easiest class in the game, are brain dead and behave obnoxiously when it comes time to loot. Honestly, now that I'm reminded of the years of frustration of having to deal with you all, I'll be doing the same and recommending others follow suit.
---
I suggest leveling without a guide. Let the quests lead you to new areas.
---
A masterpiece!
---
Its doesnt naturally balance out. But what ever excuse you need to have to wait hours to play a game. All the smart kids wont be doing that and will just transfer if its needed. Your going to be waiting to play while be are hitting level 10 lol

---
The idea is that allowing this will make the addon standard. It's a feature that was purposely excluded from classic for a reason. The reasons are obviously subjective, so I won't bother arguing if you can't see why this addon goes against the spirit of the game.
---
&gt; I’ve played vanilla and never saw anyone using this.
---
How would you know if the "LFM2M scholo" message you read in chat was posted by an addon or by a human?
---
How would you know if the LFG message you posted in chat wasn't parsed by a LFG addon and shown in a [addon interface](https://i.imgur.com/P9u90Kj.jpg).
---
I think your misunderstanding the word hybrid. By hybrid spec i literally mean its a spec which puts lots of points into multiple trees, rather than going deep into one spec. I chose to leave the DS/Ruin build out beacause its a hybrid, thus too complex to accurately fit into a quick look infographic (hence why i made the note).
---
And as far as destruction for leveling, I already stated previously that I am clearly wrong on that and will be changing it to neutral, alongside putting destro as a + for pvp.
---
Im not inventing anything lol, just offering a solution to his problem. 
---
I can't even be asked to actually put people on my ignore list, let alone download and configure a blacklist filter for all words.

Good one. Havent played since wotlk and in not tard enough to let this addon make me whine like a lil bitch

I used to play on a 13 inch mbp 2015 i5/264SSD/8 gb ram for like a month for legion (lol) and I could get like steady 60 FPS on low settings. Raids were like 20 FPS on low still. You can get away with it for the most part but it’ll put a lot of stress on the mac and will heat surprisingly quickly. I just bought a rig thankfully so I’ve graduated from the college gamer life haha, but I get it. That’s my review.

I’d buy an older 15” or 17”. You can usually buy older refurbished MBP’s off of apple and still have a good warranty. Or buy it used from eBay or craigslist and save more money. I wouldn’t go for a new MBP mostly due to price...

I played TBC on a 17” MBP and it ran wonderfully. Integrated graphics would probably still do okay if you’re not going to try max graphics.

Yea it’s been confirmed and also cross realm BG were added in patch 1,12 anyway. So they were part of vanilla.

I remember playing before patch 1.12 and the BGs were pretty much impossible on my alliance dominated server. It was a 4hr queue for warsong gulch. Match ended. Then another big queue.

---
I just found the video of it being used. Yeah it has an auto invite option which is pretty poor. I won't use it myself. I kind of like hanging out in capitals. But regardless when you're actually looking for a dungeon whilst levelling you're generally questing in that zone so just advertise in /1. I don't recall ever having an issue finding groups.

But they are ugly :( :(
---
I'm betting you experience a wipe on your first run. Not because of you specifically, but if you go in a lot of those dungeons and accidentally pull one or two extra mobs there is a good chance of wiping. There are patrol mobs in a lot of those dungeons too. It's pretty easy to not be paying attention and pull more than intended and cause a wipe.

Alliance or Horde?

Horde; Shaman, Mage, Warlock in basically that order.

Alliance; Hpal, Mage, Warlock in basically that order.

Keep in mind, leveling a paladin is dull as hell.

He is. Macs are real computers whether you like it or not. Ironic that the people that always reply with this asinine comment, and there is always at least one, don’t know what a computer is.
---
&gt; Auto invite is bad how?
---
Grouping in Classic is about social interaction. With auto invites there is no social interaction, not to mention it will make the abuse of layer hopping even easier.
---
The underline problem with retail wow and lfg is it dumbed down everything. You dont need CC mechanics and getting gear from bosses has 0 sastifaction because in 1 hour you will outlevel/or get another peice thats better.  It honestly has nothing to do with the means of getting a group together and getting to the instance.
---
Dont beleive me? Get on retail and you can get a group together like the old days. Its still just mindless tanking and spanking to do as much as you can for XP.
---
It's a LFG addon in vanilla, there is no excuse.
---
Where can one find these addons to download in a most reputable manner?
---
It's a 27 vs 77 ms difference for me.  I notice it on Volcanic m+ weeks, or timing mechanics like the Safety Dance in Naxx.
---
EU:

Razorgore

Do you really need a guide to just do what you want to do at whatever speed you want to do it?
---
Two words. One word. Sulfuras.

Yes because I'm playing horse for the fird time and I'll be lost forsure!

...except maces...
---
Vanilla's culture has been dead since BC has been out.
---
Whatever people are calling it now, is some fucked up zombie that's been dictated by private servers and a bunch of people who never played the game.
---
1.12 talents change the culture. Faster internet changed the culture. Fuck literally knowing what your BiS's are for the entirety of the game changes the culture.
---
This isn't Vanilla and never will be. Scrubbing an add on, that did exist back then, just to uphold some sense of purity is crazy. Because as someone who played nearly 100% add on free, literally any add ons are a change to the culture of Vanilla.
---
&gt;You can't be helped
---
A well played holy pally makes the biggest difference. Dispelling, multiple bubbles, plate, blessing of freedom, great heals. Healing in general is the biggest factor, and holy pally is a tier above the rest.
---
The same hairstyle as well.
---
God I wish human females where real.
---
I know that wow used to be able to run on crap computers, I'm concerned about the new geaphic updates that they implemented with legion or BFA , I'm not sure which one. Supposedly they made the game much more demanding and Classic wow will be running on those settings.
---
How it actually changes the experience? Leatrix Plus and every raid manager addon has auto invite built in. You have to setup the initial message, people that see it need to whisper you, instead of right click in the name of the player and click invite, that small step is automatic (if you want), than you still have to talk to people and go to the dungeon. It just better shows the information that was already there (LFM messages), that's what nearby every addon does, better display information that is already there.
---
Buy what you want. Ignore the parrots that just repeat the same anti-Mac rhetoric they see other people say
---
Holy shit are you foreal? I had no idea there were quests under there.
---
Pick any guide you want.
---
Not just go to that area when your that level.
---
All in all get a map with the levels of the area
---
If you live in the Midwest, perhaps.  It's a 50 ms difference for me near DC.
---
Defending a corporation= fine. Criticizing it=mentally ill. Got it. Where have I heard this before. Oh yeah. When people said The Last Jedi was a bad movie. It worked really well then. Solo lost a few hundred million after marketing.
---
I definetly did not level one in classic thats for sure! I simply followed the guides I found and did the best i could. Most guides i found didn't go into demo at all, and stuck primarily with affliction and a bit of destro.
---
That said I was clearly wrong about destro's leveling rating, and will change that to neutral!
---
&gt; It basically just means ~~no queues.~~all noobs.
---
Same. Ping isn’t a concern, and tons of C and EST folks are rolling there. 😁 No need to split the population tbh.
---
The drama coming out of this is juicy. I love it.
---
that's pretty much exactly what I said.
---
These addons actually existed in vanilla, they were just never popular because we had global lfg channels that were supperior in every way, and before that we had tricks to join ironforge/orgrimmar chat from and zone.
---
That’s a rogue for sure
---
Like I get playing on a server damn near pronounced “blow me” is pretty funny, but it has 0 affect on gameplay or visuals. I’d rather get into the game and play rather than wait hours to say I played on Herod for ten minutes before I quit because of all the tankers
---
Pretty sure you can have all your account characters in the same realm in retail, I have at least 14
---
I doubt it but anything is possible and mistakes definitely happen
---
No, the point of having it be difficult to form the group is so that people stick together after the group is formed instead of disbanding when it gets too challenging. If you lower the pain of finding a group too much, you start increasing the number of groups that just say “fuck it, I’m just gonna pop a new group in the addon and make a sandwich” instead of communicating with their group to overcome. Ultimately overcoming a challenge after long struggles bonds a group.
---
Just don't use it if you don't like it.
---
&lt;3
---
Vanilla? Would that phraseology suit you better?
---
Ya but everybody was 10 and didn't know how to download them L0l

He mentioned Old Blanchy as the most meme name, along with Mirage Raceway,  and in a tone that was like “There’s no way tho, right guys?” And here we are. It’s an actual server. As well as Bigglesworth. Fuck give me Nethergarde Keep or Firemaw or Morgraine, make all the server names awesome.  I’ll see some of you on Cuckbanks 👋
---
Could somebody fill me in on the best way to play paladin please?
---
Battlegrounds are crossrealm so faction balance on a specific server wont necessarily be predictive of queue length
---
There are literally battle net forums that are exactly that.
---
Blizzard already  [has one](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/get-started-finding-people-here/215459)

Couldn't agree more my friend, great post!
---
Dude this addon would have been possible to make in Vanilla and IIRC there was a very similar addon called Call to Arms or something along those lines.
---
twitch client works for me. I had to click the gear icon on the top right and add a game for it to bring up the pull down menu to switch between retail and classic addons. https://i.imgur.com/SUv7TJM.png

Well done sir.  Agreed wholeheartedly.
---
Twitch client. It's the old curse client just updated and renamed over the years.
---
Are you serious? I’m gonna tank dungeons, a lot of them, and I’m not gonna just stop when I’m geared.
---
I don’t understand this line of questioning. 
---
I’m also going to MT or OT a serious raiding guild.
---
It's ok to be wrong.
---
You should read. It doesn’t share any information regarding item level, and the description/title is the message that people see at the chat, you can just add any information to your chat message “LF2M 1HEALER 1 DPS SCHOLOMANCE MIN ILVL REQ 150+ OR NO INV”.

Reddit patrol is dictating what people should play now.

But those are opposites. You want good experience whilst'd leveling? Don't go to zones you dislike.

&gt; saying **Medium**pop NOW is higher pop than the highest pop servers back in vanilla
---
FTFY. Saying low pop is bigger than old vanilla cap would be saying that 1 player is bigger than vanilla servers since they all start on low.

This is a critical point that people miss when they are arguing "Hurr Durr don't use it"
---
No your flag will go up automatically if you do a bunch of things. 
---
See here https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/PvP_flag
---
Your flag will be put up in any of these situations:
---
You put your PvP flag up permanently.
---
This is done by the /pvp slash command or from player's portrait menu (right click on portrait, select PvP | Enable). Typing /pvp while flagged will disable PvP.
---
You engage another player of an opposing faction in combat other than dueling.
---
Many consider it an honorable act to put up your PvP flag before engaging another player, to give him or her a fair chance to react. To attack someone before you put your own flag up is known as bluewalling. While Bluewalling is not against any official rules and is used by some as part of their PvP strategy, many others consider it to be very cowardly. It does not preclude getting yourself killed, however, and there are stories on the official Blizzard forums of some getting bluewalled and coming out on top.
---
You cast a spell on a player whose flag is up.
---
If you cast a buff (for example, Power Word: Fortitude) on your friend who has his PvP flag up, yours will also go up. If you cast a healing spell or resurrect a flagged player, your flag will go up.
---
You attack an NPC marked by a PvP flag, like most quest givers, guards, and vendors. This usually applies to NPCs of the opposite faction, but also to neutral factions if you are at war with them, and in rare cases, your own faction. Certain quests require you to kill these type of NPCs. You may also be flagged without attacking aforementioned NPCs, but instead they striking you, this is considered to largely be a bug that has existed throughout the history of the game, be wary about getting attacked by guards.
---
You are in proximity to certain NPCs marked by a PvP flag. These NPCs are often found near settlements of an opposing faction, such as Goldshire and Razor Hill.
---
You accept some of the PvP quests. You will remain flagged as long as that quest is in your quest log.
---
You enter a specific territory. The scheme for flagging by zoning-in is shown in the table bellow:
---
I prefer reality by a mile, really really well done
---
Almost, except I spent 3k on a home free weight gym and 2k on a new pc for classic. Either way I'll be eating top ramen.
---
Find a guild that has regular adults in it.

Should we tell him?

maybe, but still curious. Strawpoll open.

Weed is a vice? I'm getting super baked right before the servers go live.

Its a shame, somebody should make a new one.

Wait a sec.... I'm rolling human.
---
I also just realized he conjured mana studel. That's Cata. Whatever. Still my fav.
---
THIS! man I tell you what, since BC I have been horde. Leveled horde, always played horde, never a second thought. In classic I am rolling Alliance and I cannot wait to discover a new side to the game. Not a single guide, not a single anything, just going to make my human mage, and jump off the cliff of adventure. I cant wait for all the story lines/quests that I missed out on in places like Elwyn, Westfall, Redridge, etc. Despite WoW being a game that I have played for years, I truly feel like I am about to start a brand new adventure and that is all I am worried about. But to each their own.
---
Good luck! Knock 'em out, bud.
---
Yeah, that's what I think is the biggest risk for these mods is that servers will be so big that they don't have the communities that Vanilla WoW had back in the day, and tools like this will make impersonal groups.
---
I don't think it's a very good argument, because it's still a huge investment to run to a dungeon.  It's still some degree of consistency as to who is in your server, and dungeons still need a degree of coordination.
---
Keep in mind he’s mentioned it multiple times every time new servers came out...and it still happened
---
“What?! I was just testing to see if you guys were standing in the fire”.
---
Try to read what it does and how. It keeps every meaningful aspect of social interaction. You will be joining people creating groups through it without even notice or be able to differentiate from other people on public chat channels.
---
If I remember correctly it wasn't about the price or being charged, it was because the dude said one thing then recanted and charged anyway.
---
I'm just the messenger, please don't kill me. I don't give a fuck either way...
---
Right? With the number of adults with limited play hours, it's surprising people want to sit around in Org/IF for hours spamming for groups.
---
People didnt try hard to kill Ragnaros in 1 week either
---
I'm gonna give this a try https://sage-guide.netlify.com/lime.html
---
Yeah mate, the valuable afk time, you can crush a meal down, BIO break, Smoke, you name it! haha Tram you still have to pay attention blah.
---
Those "enthusiasts" will probably fall out within a reasonable amount of time and all that will be left, by majority, is old vanilla wow OGs and pserver turbonerds.
---
Both. They play both factions to monopolize resources. You can't avoid them by playing the "same" faction.
---
All I can do is fight it. If I lose, I’ll move on. Many people have worked much harder than I have to get Classic. Now I can do my little part to help preserve its integrity. Get retail anti social mechanics out.

How is spamming world chat over and over again or scanning the rapidly moving chat to find a group considered community aspect?
---
All the addon does is to remove spam from world chat.
---
Mooncloth Bag is the only one that you could get on a level 1 bank alt, the others are BoP.
---
Good retort.
---
Gear score is fine. It's more efficient, and all the #nochange manbabies are going to have a hard time trying to stop people from being efficient in every way possible 
---
If you want to be carried you need to make some friends 
---
If the leader is asking for too high of a score, they wouldn't have invited you in the first place 
---
Gear score is fine, you smell like beef
---
The reason people have them on retail is because there was a small window (like 24 hours) in wod where their name “blocker” was effectively offline. I have like 150 of these names but I couldn’t remake a character with the name now.
---
As for classic, I’ve heard some people getting lore names but I can’t cobfirm. A friend got Valeera but that could just not be blocked.
---
I am playing osrs doing some quest I had been putting off but I will be putting it down Monday.
---
&gt; Auto invite is a really good way to get a junk group comp and therefore I doubt it’ll be used very often. 
---
You can make a group for anything. It doesn't have to be just for dungeons. If you want to make a shit group that's on you but automating invites so that people are just as faceless as they are in retail is a bad line to cross.
---
&gt; However, the ability to passively search for a group while farming I see as a net gain
---
Exactly, just no auto invites.
---
&gt;  You will still have to type lf2m blah blah and whisper inv
---
This would work fine without auto invites
---
Your looking at semi-hardcore and hardcore wrong.
---
They say requires worldbuffs but they are actually looking for a certain mindset.
---
these guilds want are other people who want to push there characters dps and want to min max.
---
 Hardcore typically means a greater time investment and want to do everything as efficiently as possible they will want there dps to rank.
---
Kickass, love it
---
My girlfriend said she was surprised to find out I was “this nerdy”. The last couple months I have been playing an mmo called Albion online, It takes a lot of time and being on discord. She has been amazing with it. My excitement for classic must be annoying.
---
All of this is because I communicated what I like and needed. I like to play games and if that’s who she’s going to be with then she should know the full extent. Figuring out living together is really weird.
---
As far as giving things up? Just be yourself and keep going to work. If you don’t have free time just plan to play casual.
---
Saying goodbye to everyone
---
Ok, you Dutch have been granted a temporary Visa on Mograine. You are required to find a guild at 60 for citizenship.
---
What it, and I'm just spitballing here, you could, I dunno, maybe make friends with people you meet in LFG? Or use it when you have a group nearly ready to go and just need to quickly fill the last spot?
---
Cross realm and random grouping is the real issue, as it means you can be an absolute garbage person and just continue to queue into groups who aren't aware of who you are. More so, in the LFG finder, it's a real pain to kick someone. 
---
So yea, as long as you can control who you group with and the pool of people isn't so vast it becomes meaningless, an LFG tool isn't bad. It's when it becomes an incentive to be shitty that it's an issue, and then that poor behavior is rewarded by Blizz nerfing the dungeons so anyone can complete them, despite the toxic people you end up with. So now you're not only in a group with toxic psychos but the boring nature of the whole thing has drained the life out of anyone who cared in the first place.

---
There's a fucking auto invite feature in the add-on you dense fucking brainlet
---
I never said it will happen. I'm saying the chances of it happening are a billion to one, since it requires an insane amount of "stockpiling" that would require hundreds of accounts of nothing but bank alts.
---
&gt; How exactly does auto invite abuse layer hopping?
---
People list groups so that they can find people on other layers easier and just get auto layered when they apply to the party.
---
Hahaha no way
---
I think you’ll be fine. Most of us are going into classic with the same situation. We no lifed the game over a decade ago and want to get back in but have a lot of shit going on. There will be tons of guilds for people like us and I think most of us will fairly easily move through content up until naxx.
---
The clip you linked below does not match what you just said, you still need to whisper.
---
I’d play on Windows because of gpu driver updates which seem more convoluted on OSX. Especially if you actually have an nvidia or Radeon card.
---
I literally didn't see that!
---
Rip social life hello classic!
---
I think the point being made is that the old way of forming groups in Classic is antiquated and not useful. 
---
Its only purpose is to serve a nostalgia factor, but the practice is inefficient and actually really bad. 
---
The system itself is doomed to fail as the game continues to progress. When most players are maxed level and no one is really creating alts anymore, new players are going to find it nearly impossible to get groups to do elite quests in the zones they are in, or find dungeon members easily. 
---
That's ***exactly*** what happened in Vanilla, TBC, etc. 
---
These features were not added because Blizzard was just catering to the player base. They were created to fix a problem. Humans are efficient creatures and they try to improve upon things that are bad and inefficient.  
---
If this addon gets squashed, there's going to be something else that will take its place. 
---
&gt; And thats perfectly fine.
---
Then why stop the addon? I am not trying to be a dick, just trying to figure out your point of view. 
---
You still have to journey to the dungeon in question. The only person that can summon is a warlock ***outside*** of an instance, so the only thing these addons fix is just finding a group.
---
This addon existed in vanilla.  You're ignorant
---
The add-on will be counter productive. You will end up on the ignore list of everybody who matters and only get paired with people who can't find groups in a normal way. ( Hint these are often ninja looters , doucebags or just very bad players, that's why they are avoided)
---
What is this nuanced and compromising idea doing here?
---
This sub is for hardline jerkoffs only.
---
Yes! This is more or less what I’ve been saying for the past couple years now: the problem is not that Blizzard added literally any QoL features. There were some real holes in the Vanilla UX that needed patching. The problem was that their specific implementations optimized for convenience at the expense of immersion and social cohesion, when all three of those are parts of the overall “quality of life.”
---
There was nothing sacred or even good about spamming a floating chat box to simulate a recruitment board. Even making you run to the one most popular capital to ensure people would read your post is an RP wash—it makes sense when you’re open to any dungeon but bypassing the capital nearest the dungeon you’ve chosen and crossing an ocean to recruit one more is silly.
---
Having a UI for the initial posting is great IMHO. They should have tied it to a recruitment board or barkeep in an adventurer’s hall, though. Maybe even use the meeting stone as a way to make a listing to those boards. Then just let people send a quick note with their “ask to join” button and convert it to a whisper. All the convenience of the modern custom LFG dialog but tied to an in-world magical artifact, boosting immersion. Now your group still has to run out of the instance when you lose a member, and can directly negotiate with applicants about whether they can run to meet you solo or need help.
---
Flying is a similar story—travel really did get tedious with few flight points and few alternative transit methods outside of the civilized hubs. It’s super convenient to set your own course at high speed and even a pretty darn strong immersion boost, at least at first. But its boost to open exploration also trivializes so many obstacles that you lose a big reason to search for allies in open world content. Or even stop bothering to take the “expected” path through the enemy camp. I think the Flight Whistle and the addition of other transit networks like the rowboats and warships/dock masters solve the general QoL problem much better than fully unleashed flight, as much as I’ll miss it in Classic.
---
I do think Blizzard has finally started to learn this lesson a bit on retail. Even just representing your mythic keystone as an item looted from chests and that has to be physically placed in a gizmo at the start of the dungeon is nice. I’d love to see a better transition than a loading screen, but I’ll take what I can get.
---
My guess it that all EST servers will be in the same battlegroup. Regardless of it’s a pve or pvp server. Vanilla battlegroups included both pve/pvp. So if alliance have a PVE sever advantage it may even out a bit.
---
Thanks! I’m constantly getting downvoted for this obvious thing 
---
We gotta be prepared for the new age of gamer to come in with their lfg addons and gearscore mindset to essentially try to make this perfect game something that resembles a Frankenstein’s monster version of vanilla and retail.
---
It needs to be discussed and addressed.
---
Will anything change? Probably not but you can’t blame a guy for trying.
---
There was no spamming of ilvl for getting groups in vanilla. You were a priest? Come on in? You were a warm body of any appropriate class? Fuck it let’s go.
---
This is true in any game I think. I play rocket league and I am in the one of the lowest ranks. But everybody I play with uses the same vehicle (the octane) because that is what all the top players use. It doesn't matter if you can't hit an aerial shot to save your life, you have to use the octane to get every little big of advantage over your opponent. 
---
I'm a huge fan of variety, and it makes me a bit mad. 
---
Which is also why I love smash bros ultimate. There are like 15 characters that are considered top tier. And it's so much more fun.
---
I just did this using the code and serial of my phone:
---
"Error: An error occured while restoring your authenticator.

It will almost certainly run better under windows, but I’ve been playing retail this week on a 2012 iMac under OS X, and with low graphics settings, it runs smooth enough. I would say use it under whatever OS you prefer to run most of the time. I expect it’ll run fine.
---
I know were bored but is this the only joke left to say the game is unplayable?
---
Thanks!
---
It was never an important add-on.  I am not against add-ons. I am the kind of player who downloaded add-on collections with thousands off them, sifting through, looking for something useful.

But you're forgetting when we said no changes  we meant no changes we didn't like. Changes we do like are okay.

Well, yeah. That's what makes the LFD system so unbearable to use.
---
Premade Groups mainly just improves upon the channel chat system of making groups. So being shitty either at the game or as a person means people will remember them and only invite at their own discretion, and it won't be at the expense of the instances. And it's as easy for the party leader to kick someone in their premade group as it is to invite them in the first place.

Thats how I learned about it, from my guild

And I recognize your name from another post!!

Wait why would you need to buy water if you are at home?
---
&gt; delete their 3 characters and switch to a low pop one
---
At same time as opening the new servers they are removing the 3 character limit. So people can try for their names on the new servers with no risk.
---
Whatever dude, gearscore effects the community.
---
Equating people, not just the entire population, of a server to a simple number has an extremely negative effect on the interactions between people in real life, and in game.

There’s nothing wrong with inspecting a pug to see if they have any gear, experience, or investment in their character, but when you reduce everything to a number it takes so much more away than it gives.

Gonna go hard on some gold mining this weekend, hopefully dig up a couple oz's. Not sure if I'm going to be camping out there (it's pretty far into the mountains) or if I'll be coming and going.
---
I can buy some great beef jerky for $10 a bag, got a few bags ready to roll for the first couple days. Other than that it's just salad and water. 
---
Where I'm at for mining... the internet barely functions (4 mb down if I'm lucky) but everything is downloaded and ready to go. The people here don't quite understand what I'm talking about when I tell them I'm going radio silent for a couple days to play a game.
---
In short, yes.
---
It was not.
---
I think you just need to make sure to join the right guild. Ideally, you’ll want to join a Pacific sever to make raid times. Your first priority is to your wife and kid, so don’t get hung up on joining a hardcore guild. Join a semi hardcore or casual guild that raids and enjoy the game at a pace that doesn’t ruin your life.
---
I’m in the same boat - played vanilla when I was single with no kids. Now I have a wife and three kids. The game will be different, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to enjoy it in a different way!
---
&gt; The drip feed you get of ease of access ends where retail is today. “If I’m just spamming trade, why not automate it?” “If I’m gonna kill the mobs why not make them die faster?” “If I’m going to get to max level regardless, why not increase my XP rate?”
---
That's a really bad slippery slope argument. 
---
Spamming trade is ***not**** an inefficient way of finding a group. Humans love to be efficient when encountering a problem. 
---
I was playing in the tail end of beta was unable to get a group to do deadmines. I tried spamming chat for 20mins and couldn't get a group together. 
---
Having a group system, like LFG or even a half assed one in Classic, is just efficiency.
---
@MyWarchief
---
I wont use this or any group finding addon. Any rational person with a good heart won't either
---
The guy who created the addon didn't just make this addon for a LFG bulletin board. The addon has talent inspect option and auto-invite even though he states there is no automatic matchmaking. The addon forms the group automatically without you needing to be at your keyboard, that's automatic matchmaking.
---
It's going to turn into the raider.IO for Classic with gearscore and ilvl inspect later down the road. I don't trust the author and this addon is a terrible idea.
---
I love everything about this. Having accountability for your actions is massively important in a game as social as WoW Classic.
---
&gt;No one knows whats gonna happen. Not even blizz sure as fucking titties no one here
---
Pretty much this. It feels like blizzard is just flopping around in the dark, and they have all the stats available to them. What chance do we have of guessing what the queues are going to be like.
---
I've seen alot of people getting their dicks in knots over this and saying some vile shit
---
I dont watch youtubes because my personality doesnt scream follower. My genetics make me a leader not a follower.
---
Can you provide me a link for them asking for the Drivers license? You can not contact Blizz any other way without logging into your account.
---
Not planning to switching from Skeram
---
Can't wait to hear the story of Razorgore on release day.
---
told you
---
Agreed completely. 
---
Social connections are further made in order to save time in the future. You benefit from adding someone as a friend. Creating a  relationship with reliable and friendly players is a whole element that just doesn't need to happen with LFG.
---
Seriously, whoever thought that was a good idea should be fired. 
---
I don't care about the 10 murlocs I'm about to kill providing me the same challenge on day 1 as day 365. Make some more content.
---
I meant..I know in vanilla wow LFG wasnt a thing. But in wow classic what's being released in a few days they have LFG added to the game.
---
I'm sorry,, this guy's voice and cadence remind me too much of Alex Jones

I just got back city of heroes a few months ago and now I got this.  2019 has been a great year for 2004 mmorpgs!
---
It's a remaster. They picked a late vanilla patch, 1.12.1 I think, and are using the modern client and server to run it.
---
Pretty sure that was KTM your referring to
---
Yeah I agree. There's some that are fine but most of them are filled with edgy kids with anime avatars that make "jokes" about awful shit
---
These addon police that seem to be sprouting everywhere as some of the most obnoxious people on wow. Constantly telling people what they should and shouldn’t do and finding halfass arguments to support their outlandish claims. 
---
I won’t be using the addon, but don’t care at all who does.
---
He's giving the human a head start.
---
Y'all mfers been entirely too friendly
---
Shit is on sight
---
That is just wrong.
---
Private servers are incredibly overtuned in leveling content compared to classic.
---
Agreed completely.
---
Social connections are further made in order to save time in the future. You benefit from adding someone as a friend. Creating a relationship with reliable and friendly players is a whole element that just doesn't happen with LFG.
---
I'm so confused. Do you know how to surf the internet or watch YouTube? You're telling me you don't know what WoW Classic is, or how to find out?
---
You had to wait that long because the beta was dead at the end. And it is unfortunate that you have to wait at times, but sometimes people aren’t forming a group for it. Slippery slope is a fallacy without causal coorelation. We have the best example possible for that in retail.
---
They do not  have lfg in classic because it wasn't in vanilla. There is an lfg add-on but it's mostly just something similiar to the way premade group finder works
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT783hZIUXY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT783hZIUXY)

right but that all requires you to either interact with someone who is flagged or you enter an enemy town/territory
---
you don't just auto-flag for being near pvp
---
I SAY NO!
---
I agree, i remember people getting booted from guilds over ninja incidents. It got worse when they added the ability to name change, but even then people had to pay money to get it done to clear their name and normally the community would sniff them out and expose who they really were. 
---
Remember, this game wasnt the best game in the world based on design. It was the best game in the world because of its community.
---
Heh. I will definitely have a casual alt on Mommy’s server. Strictly for the lulz, of course. And no other reason.
---
Yeah, you surrendered before Union soldiers even set foot in your state :^)
---
It's fairly close to what vanilla was like in 1.12. There's a bit of wonky stuff going on with the timing of patches and content, but that shouldn't make it vastly different. 
---
Join the fun man. Everybody is starting from scratch and you would be joining at the exact right time. Some people are going to rush ahead, but tons of people are just going to casually level.
---
With regards to the glasses, don't apps like f.lux basically do the same thing for your eyes?

It is "basically 1.12", with dungeons and raids being released over a series of [phases](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049).  It is on a newer version of the engine, but all of the 1.12 data for items and all the goodies, as best as they can accurately recreate it.
---
I dunno man, wasp allergies can be deadly and also hard to prove you didn't have them before. If you know what I'm saying....
---
Where did I say that? I put the "source" shit so that people would *hopefully* believe what I'm saying. But sure, go ahead and play Destro in organized PvP (bg's) and let me know how that goes. I'll be in the back laughing when you can't cast a single thing and get gibbed by Warriors with TuF and Rogues with Lobo because you blindly believed someone on a casual subreddit that just blankly said "Destro pvp is pretty damn good".
---
[When launch day finally comes](https://i.imgur.com/dX8bgSS.jpg)
---
There is a limit on what people are willing to pay, and with the huge server populations we’re going to be seeing it’s not unlikely that there will be a decent supply of boe epics. If someone wants to buy two of them for triple market value then he can be my guest.
---
You're really close to what's called an [HotW Druid](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/01-503202130321214-05550311001) (1/29/21). It's a versatile, optimized version of your build that can tank 5 mans, heal anything, and be annoying PvP as a flag runner/healer/kiter/base defender. You won't be killing people but that's life as a Druid.
---
He's so excited he can't do the buttoning
---
Lfg isn't an issue of it's not cross server. What difference does it make how your group is formed?
---
Never thought I'd get strong nostalgia from a forum layout.
---
Also it's way better. The current one has so much useless blank space and the lack of pages is the worst.
---
This is really good!
---
People are reactionary.
---
People also like efficiency. 
---
What will happen is that the addon gets banned, and then a separate program or discord server will popup instead. 
---
It'll provide the ***exact same*** function except it will be one step removed. 
---
Somehow that's a win.

 ♫ The Final Countdown ♫
---
You completely miss the point of this addon. When I'm forming a group for something and I don't recognize someone's name (be it in a positive or negative way) I still invite them. It's only during the dungeon that I get to know them. 
---
The initial creation of the group comes down to me writing in world chat and strangers answering to it with *inv*. The addon just skips that part and makes it easier for everyone involved to find pugs or members. Nothing social about spamming world chat.
---
If you're playing with friends or guild mates anyway you don't need that addon at all.
---
Exactly. Mine sees the countdown on the fridge and also understands what magnitude this launch is.  I even made a video about this with some irl tips. I wanted to go more in depth but it took way too long to make 😅. https://youtu.be/EtemiebTToo
---
Yeah but WESTfall.  Missed opportunity.
---
I'm parking my ass on Herod and skipping the first week. When all you mfers go back to work, I make my move.

Dead on arrival. DONT PLAY

It might even backfire and put people on ignore lists.,.,
---
Does anyone know the server cap with layering and the queue cap? I can't find the info now, I read that the pop could be so high that you could be fighting for a position just to join the queue.
---
I'm a little concerned my name will be more difficult to get now, should I choose to switch servers.
---
Ehhhh, I think 3d is easy with outside support, but your average efficient dungeon grind isn't going to be getting lower than 4d imo.
---
But honestly its a toss-up on whether or not the level 40+ dungeons are as nerfed as SM is vs private servers.
---
burnout isn't *just* a matter of play time though.  Surely it's a huge factor, but consider if the optimal route to 60 was killing the same boars over and over like in South Park, but only by a few percent.  You still end up with less play time but I can almost guarantee people would be more likely to burn out that way.  Obviously a hyperbolic example, but it proves my point.
---
If it takes 100% longer to hit 60 not following a guide then the time plays a huge factor.  But at some % it shifts the other way, I'd wager.  Maybe if it takes 20% longer but the experience was (if one could quantify this) 40% more fun than it would have been with a guide...then would you say that following a guide leads to less burnout?
---
I don't know that I'm trying to outright disagree with you, and I *definitely* agree with your final statement.

Built from the ground up. I used React for the front end and Elixir/Phoenix for the back end with a postgres database. I mainly started the project because I thought Elixir looked kinda cool and I had nothing to use it for. Turns out Elixir is pretty neat, but not really suitable for hobby projects IMO.
---
Here's the source code: https://github.com/mgerb/classic-wow-forums
---
If you have access to a pull-up bar for pull-ups, light dumbbells for plank/renegade rows, or a band for band rows - they would make a nice addition to the push-ups and squats.  Too often people focus on only using their "pushing" muscles and neglect their back.  For a population that is already at risk for kyphosis, shoulder impingement, and forward head posture from being at a computer for so long, it's really important.  Good luck!
---
It’s really not. When you first take a pet it’s extremely not-neat.

Also don’t let them die or the progression in that loyalty level will be lost.

When did you start playing?
---
Ugh, can I get a summon though?
---
The mailbox post. lol
---
Man I could have sworn I’d first learned about meeting stones as an LFG tool but by the time I’d summoned the courage to expose my lack of skills to strangers the stones were about summoning and I figured I’d just heard about a design that was trashed during development. It always sounded like a better idea than chat, too. I started playing when my server was actively doing the Gates of Ahn’Qiraj campaign, and I definitely remember running Scarlet Monastery for the first time after BC launched so... I was probably a pretty slow player.
---
Heck I even pitched that gossip system as a better implementation of the current LFD auto-group system like 20 minutes ago in this thread. Go figure.
---
I look forward to earning epics not handed them.
---
If I start seeing ilvl in classic I’ll fucking quit.
---
Killing centaurs to trigger Vergosh is the worst. One time it took over 1.5 hours to get him to appear. Then someone killed him before I was able to get there.
---
Interestingly, it depends entirely upon what you deem as interesting! Interesting indeed
---
I don’t believe per the devs that they were working correctly and have since been patched.
---
Dude I'm in the boat as you, also with a 2 year old
---
Play retail if you want this. Don’t ruin our game
---
Did anyone ask in the AMA how they chose the names?
---
What the hell are you babbling about here? If it takes someone three hours to form a group they are gonna stop playing because that shit is fucking stupid.
---
I read about some people losing their names off-peak while even doing a countdown with a friend to hold it while modifying. Just in the second it took the friend to click create. So it sounds possible that's going around
---
I literally noted that as an exception in my comment.
---
Agree. Ilvl in classic is not even remotely representative representative of the players ability until you start talking about 80+. For example if I want dps anywhere in p1-3 I'm taking a prebis warrior over a t2 anything except maybe a perds rogue or chromag xbow hunter. Prebis stuff is always lower ilvl than a new player who thought he better get his t0 for raiding, feral hat, healer hat and gloves, the list goes on and on. Anyone who is lf39m mc must have full t1 bindings res is going to be lfm forever, 39m is quite a bit different to 19m, and 39m from a population of 5,000 is very, very different. I'll clear it with half the raid in greens and get back to town to see them spamming lf37m.  
---
I'll take you in greens, you'll remember that and want to run with me when you're geared af. I'm starting to suspect that retails xrealm dungeons have people a bit blurry on how these kind of things are going to work in classic. The persistent and smaller community changes everything.
---
Got a bunch of wooden Benders in here.
---
That's nice and all, but in comparison to the PVP server it's essentially dead.
---
On the WoW classic discord server, Arugal has 2700 players in comparison to 430 players. I realize that the discord won't have a lot of people in the oceanic community but the ratio should still be very similar.
---
But from how I understand it that post isn't saying feral druids do 700dps, its saying they typically do 30% less dps than mages warlocks rogues, and fury warriors.   The numbers are just based off the arbitrary baseline of 1000 for elite dps.
---
Yep, played vanilla to Cataclysm and only raised vanilla and even that was minimal. Spent most my life in AV
---
No worries! I'm just glad that I have the opportunity to be apart of such an incredible community. Excited to catch the streams and hopefully do a little streaming myself.

Hi, /u/Best_Effort_Brewing
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cu8306/discussion_would_you_like_wow_classic_to_be_like/). 
---
I wonder if he will be playing again?
---
I see our sites as doing different things. I think both can be used to find gear for your character, it just a different way of searching for gear. 
---
Sixty Upgrades is your private character list, but I see classic wow builds as being more of a community site. The bis searches can be performed by anyone(don't need to log in unless you want to save stat weights) and the links can be shared with other players. 
---
Classic wow builds also had more use while leveling, and while you can change your level with sixty upgrades, the site is mostly focused on max level.
---
The other portion of classic wow builds is for creating builds that the community votes on rather than a private character page. I also personally feel classic wow builds is simpler and easier to use and definitely faster to get started with. But this is obviously my biased opinion.
---
With that said sixtyupgrades has been around longer and definitely has fleshed out a lot of their features more.
---
This wasn't a big thing
---
"Warnings to prevent inviting or being a member of a group with a player on your ignore list"
---
Exactly what I have been looking for. Thank you. I hope I can add horde as well.
---
Did I hear [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
&gt; because their group will disband after the first wipe, for a simple reason : the group is made up of "gogogogo" players.
---
What? 
---
In Classic, you'll be stuck with shit players or problematic players. Why? Because kicking them out of the group will not even be worth doing. 
---
What, you're going to kick that rogue out of the group because he's being an asshole to everyone else? Then you're gonna hearth back to town to spam trade for 5-10mins. Get your replacement, then spend another 5 mins flying back with the replacement to your waiting teammates so you can finish the instance after a 15min detour? LOL.
---
IDK how this addon works, but you can kick that guy out, then use it to find a replacement ez pz. Bonus points if they happen to be nearby or in the same zone as you. You won't even have to leave the instance at all to spam chat.
---
Recount Vs Details.    
---
Any strong opinions one way or the other?
---
wot r u on about fam, lfg wasnt in classic, vanilla, any of the betas. are you talking about retail trial or something?
---
For someone who wanted to call my slippery slope statement questionable I find it interesting you’re okay making the claim that the exact same thing will happen to Classic. Some of the playerbase, sure, but alternate characters? New people trying it out? I’m not so sure I agree it will see player drop off that bad. 
---
They also are not developing something new. They’ve taken their game down the path of LFD and noticed the extremely loud outcry for not that functionality. Forcing it into the game that is made specifically to dodge these things is not a good move for the community. I appreciate you at least not being a shit about disagreeing with me though. It’s crazy how toxic this has become.
---
TIL Cata = classic WoW 😳
---
I literally just subbed bak so that I will be able to play classic and checked my gold. I have enough for nearly 3 wow tokens right now I’m just going to grind out another 20k gold and then log that character off until next expansion
---
Pause. 
---
There is a PVP server named after Kelthuzad’s cat?  Brb rerolling.
---
Most top guilds run with the minimum number of hunters/warlocks to fulfill their utility functions - pulling/kiting/tranqing and curses/banish/summons/blood pact.
---
The problem is you already get all of the utility of a ret paladin from the 5+ holy paladins you are running. So they provide nothing additional beyond their sub par dps
---
Just about any class with decent gear and played well can make a big impact.
---
It definitely auto invited as we tried to use it in vanilla, but it wasn't used on the server I played on either so it was pretty worthless and why most people still don't realize it was in and are up in arms over auto invites lol.
---
Why would your opinion be invalidated because you're interested in something outside the original scope of classic? That's literally why we got add-ons in the first place.
---
Things like openraid, or a discord bot will exist even if they block the add-on API, simply because people aren't used to waiting longer than the dungeon run to find a group and the playerbase will lean heavily to casual with limited play time 
---
We just get the choice not to use it, no sense raging about it.
---
It sucks because we've gotten like 15 friends to coordinate to start toons on Thalnos.  It would be soooo difficult to re-organize and get everyone on the same page... 
---
... but Mr. Bigglesworth is the best server name... of all time?  
---
God I want to play on that server.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/wf/services/316/977
---
Thank you for clarifying it's not ingame.
---
I agree it won’t be as bad as in retail, but it will do some extent of damage and we can’t really predict how much damage exactly it will cause. My opinion is that we don’t let it happen, but it won’t stop me from playing personally. 
---
Thank you for considering my point!
---
And you only lost the one? That’s too bad then. :-/
---
Humans follow the path of least resistance. It will be used if it's allowed in the game. We will all eventually use it if Blizzard doesn't break it.
---
Adding crossrealm features to the top of your list. Anonymity combined with less challenging content was a major factor in the decline of social interaction. Why interact with players that you wouldn't see again doing content that doesn't require communication to begin with?
---
You could always steal a Thori'dal from them, assuming we make it that far. Not sure if it's going to take 1300 days to get to that point.
---
Holy shit, it’s rising!
---
Strange, I was thinking alphabet aerobics...
---
I have no intention on making it past 19 and I'm perfectly ok with that. Low level PvP is going to rock with out all the twinks.
---
It wont work, simply put, the gearing in classic pre-raid is quite odd at times. Like the ring from princess is like a level ?49? blue and simply because it has +hit on it its BiS on some lists. Also because of the progressive shift some specs take through the raiding process their gear requirements change. Like Frost mages like crit but they like SpP more, but when they go Fire in phase 5 Crit becomes king. I mean hell, Druids/Shaman/Paladins dont even get their "ranged" item till phase 5.
---
tldr: It doesn't work, or even if someone tried it wouldnt make any sense.
---
Amazing editing work. I got goosebumps watching. Welcome Home, Brothers/Sisters. 5 more days.
---
They paid for early name reservation access
---
you might have to send in some kind of government ID (hopefully you used real name and stuff) I had this problem when you could still call blizzard it was much easier back then
---
Maybe but I would guess it's a lot easier and more efficient to have you be the one tanking/killing things as combat while he uses some DoTs and heals to keep you alive. If you commit to daggers you have to worry about pulling aggro all the time.
---
What do you mean you pulled another raptor?!
---
AUGH
---
The modern client runs amazing on macOS. Classic is not a demanding game. You will be fine running maxOS native. 
---
Add-ons are fully compatible and work identically as PC.
---
spamming LFG in chat is not social interaction lol. you're still gonna talk to the people in the party and they're on your realm
---
I don't get it
---
Westfall is in the eastern part of Azeroth but nobody has ever mentioned that have they.
---
Awesome job, OP! U are the hero we deserve
---
Exactly, which is why I personally feel that the addon is very misunderstood, and people are overreacting.
---
You asshole
---
It won't ruin the game because it won't teleport people to dungeons nor it will create lower difficult raids.
---
The addon will only make /2 less spammy. You'll still need to socialize with the people you group with and you'll still need to walk all the way to the entrance of the dungeon/raid you're going.

Should we also ban 2nd monitors because most people didn't use them in 2005?

I used Move Anything extensively in both stress tests. Everything worked other than the quest tracker.
---
This is what gets me. I was super annoyed by the AMA because sever people asked directly about how long queues would he, and the response was "LONG LOL".
---
Well how fucking long? Specific details would be much more helpful in convincing people to move off Herod to the new servers. Without that information, people are a lot less willing to gamble, knowing that in a couple months the population is likely to make a steep decline. I'd much rather deal with queues at launch than a dead server at 60.
---
\~6:55 Dungeon Meeting stones started with TBC
---
7:07 Not sure if "waiting" to buy was intentional. It's want to buy.
---
somewhere else in tbc section Keyrings were in classic and it will be back.
---
Oh boy, November lol. Plan on about 12 hours kn day 1 though so hoping to smash out 20 levels
---
I don't see how letting people play certain specs is remotely similar to this. One just has someone play not optimally, the other runs the risk of ruining the main thing that drew a lot of us to classic on the first place.
---
Community is huge draw for classic wow, and being able to replace someone instantly takes away from that. We'd just be reduced to tank/heals/dps again like retail instead of knowing this tank on your friends list is good.
---
Really hope this add-on gets broken or never takes off. I'm all for a bit of classic plus but this takes it too far.
---
Vanilla was slower paced, and has a spell batching delay of 400ms, so probably not. It would be noticeable (but still playable) on retail. It gets very bad around 150-200.

Different entirely. Gearscore is to see a person's equips, not really caring about the history of the player in any way  other than to see they're capable of surviving the instance, which is how inspection also works... If you think it's different you're reading too much into a menial thing 
---
Raider.io is used to PROVE that effort, to avoid inviting boosted players that paid their way to good gear, which is going to be a classic issue just like retail.. And just like with gearscore there will be people who expect to much from others
---
None of that has anything to do with what I said, other than

&gt; You are in proximity to certain NPCs marked by a PvP flag. These NPCs are often found near settlements of an opposing faction, such as Goldshire and Razor Hill.

which I didn't know. But I'm still 100% certain you wouldn't get auto flagged for PvP if the opposing faction was messing up your zone. That's never been a thing.
---
Why not pick up a different gathering profession? Only one person can skin.
---
Completely different argument and if you don’t know why I’m not explaining why.
---
Really anything is a viable strategy if you're duoing things. You'll get to a point where you're not immediately bursting things down and the priest tanking thing won't work out very well, but it's not like you won't be able to kill stuff. Personally I think combat would still be faster overall, but hey if you want the big ambush crits there's no reason it won't work.
---
I'll level with you dude, I'm getting back into Classic with some friends and I swear all some of them do is call back to shit they did in vanilla like they're wearing the WoW-equivalent of high school Letterman jackets still. It's like that annoying uncle who talks about his football days in the 70's or whatever. So no, I get it. I just make fun of them and move on.
---
I have no problem with any of that. Keep it outside of the game. When you are in the game, don't bypass basic game mechanics.
---
I'm only taking Tuesday off &gt;&lt;
---
I work till 5 on Monday which is right when the servers open so I'll probably get thrown far into the queue.
---
My biggest concern is being on a server that is competitive with a very populated base.
---
When I played Vanilla I was on one of the lower pop PvE servers and I can't say I want to relive that
---
From one artist to another: This is fantastic. Kudos, my friend
---
I didn't read shit because it's a fuckin blur
---
I wouldn’t make a post about it, but if I was rolling Warrior and tanking for dps gear, I wouldn’t invite a hunter.
---
Yea I don't think I've ever ran that stretch between Org and TB, tho I havent played much Horde.
---
Ok, so instead it will go like this:
---
/invite Ninja
---
Groupmember: Kick him, he's a ninja!
---
/kick Ninja
---
So your contrived complaint is still meaningless.
---
U shouldn’t be like that towards all hunters if one person behind a computer fucked your day up.
---
What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.
---
Spell batching is 400ms in Classic compared to 20ms in retail. It is way more forgiving in terms of latency.
---
&gt;Prunegang
---
10/10
---
You mained a hunter. You only got in groups that didnt blacklist you. Of course you wouldnt see the hunter hate bc you were the damn hunter taking it all
---
You won't like it, but the safest way to ensure it doesn't happen is to outright remove addons entirely.
---
“No lfg addons!! No leveling guides!! Play the game how *i* want you to play it wahhhhhh”
---
On that profession grind IRL. Best of luck!
---
You can still respec at some point though just not have 2 specs,  right?
---
changing servers again...praying for cool name again...met the president of the United States AGAIN
---
Prove that this addon existed in Vanilla.
---
[Spelldamage](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spelldamage) I think, but not sure if it's going to be ported or if you can use retail addons. Will have to wait until launch I think
---
If hate speech via skeletons is illegal, and this offensive addon isn’t...  then blizzard has no decency .. . .
---
Did you intentionally skip over the 4 60 alts part
---
What are threat meters automating that people did manually before? 
---
Threat meters provide information that people then have the opportunity to act on in many different ways. How to interpret the information is also a conscious action. A better comparison would be if threatmeters controlled your threat for you by automatically selecting the right ability to keep your threat low.
---
Lol
---
It's more efficient aka bad according to the no changes bois
---
As toxic as GRIZZLY is, the server discords are run by a group trying to push a narrative for the sole purpose of getting their discords 'approved' and made 'official' by way of Blizzard. 
---
It's pretty pathetic. There's a ton of leaks from their admin discord. If you're banned in one, there's a good chance you're banned in some you haven't even been to.
---
That would be pointless since any mob can only be skinned once and it's not restricted by who tapped it. You can literally follow around some random person and skin all their mobs (don't do this if they have skinning please...). There's no detriment either, unless you end up not killing enough beasts to keep both players skinning leveled up (almost impossible in my experience), but there's just zero benefit to having 2 skinners in a group.
---
Hey that’s a good idea, appreciate it!
---
So this addon prevents you from talking to each other for the majority of the group content you're doing?
---
The initial creation of the group is only a small part of the interaction. All this addon does is skipping the annoying, not particularly social world chat spamming.
---
What's the difference between this and a global lfg channel?
---
Vanilla has Dual Spec.
---
It's super cheap. Only 50g.
---
Yes. 50g is the max cost of a single respect I believe it starts at 1g but not 100%. No dual specs.
---

---
Yes you could do that 5 years after Vanilla came out.
---
&gt; if you want to gimp yourself just play on a private server you've had the option for 15 years.
---
That's not a fair characterization. Private servers can and regularly do go poof.
---
Exactly
---
When in doubt, just roll your personal gender, if applicable.
---
I technically started at the tail end of BC but I never really did much besides level characters and queue dungeons/bgs/lfr eventually because I was a kid, only really started -playing- in when Nighthold came out in legion.
---
This is fucking hilarious!
---
Im rolling a female orc because I think their laugh is so horrible. Horrible in a way where I spam it after killing an ally and they get triggered
---
I plan on running skinning and herb levels 1- 40. I wont be fast so banking all my gathers and selling it as I near 40 so I can pay my mouth - the server economy shod be a bit healthier but then.
---
At 40 I plan on dropping one or the other in favour of BS or Eng and leveling it up to use for the higher levels.
---
The gatherings seem to be really good in the early levels for giving you enough coin to live a comfortable life (repair bills, that cool green you found on AH, noggerfodders etc)
---
Who cares? It's not like there's not tons of other groups to go to without impatient spoiled tryhards like you.
---
I also do not understand picking a realm because of its name. It has zero impact
---
[Here ya go buddy](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg)
---
new mmorpg release , hour long queue times  , d/c , and server crashing on pretty common first few days.
---
I mean it was just a random Hero thrown in the the Frozen Throne expansion, because reasons.  It's not like Chen got any cinematics or even any lines beyond the usual unit responses.  Even in WC3 the implementation was kinda clumsy.
---
I think they should turn it on for Naxx, especially with things like Patchwork.  But having poor Jonny_Scrub_myAss getting railed in a group because he isn't that great on DPS is really going to take away from the experience.  I think Classic should be enjoyed by all, and Damage Meters only really benefit raiders or min/maxers.  Keep the meters in Raids, I totally see a point for that, but for people doing dungeons etc, just feels bad man.
---
Just means I wont be able to do dungeons...
---
It was a thing but only for hunters with a bad reputation as was mentioned. The people who explicitly said "no hunters" were typically douchebag rogues. I played an arms warrior for most of vanilla and the vast majority of times hunters would ask before rolling on my weapons.
---
Really levelheaded response and something I don’t think is really considered in the argument. This is the exact process for the majority of systems that were normalized and make modern WoW what it is today. There’s many reasons why people are keen on getting back to their roots, this is a big one.
---
Ya know fair enough man
---
Is there a link to that? I just looked up classicast, and I see it's a playlist on Esfand's youtube channel, but the most recent video is from three days ago
---
This one is legitimately a masterpiece. Every time I come back to this thread to read people's comments I'm like, "Damn, how did /u/blank-dreams do that?"
---
I fucked a polar bear, and I still couldn't get you out of my mind
---
Pretty sure you’ll pull aggro after just one backstab or ambush.
---
Yea, but for someone that has taken work off and all day to play 30 min - 3 hours seems a bit extreme.
---
Unless you’re horde. No need to get first aid guys... nothing to see here
---
Yeah of course there's lots of stuff that doesn't fit that I'm also trying to get away from, but the premade group finder is fantastic imo for finding groups without having to filter through an ungodly amount of trash
---
Specifically known as the Cold Open and the Super Cold Open
---
What is this og from?
---
It did exist in vanilla I don't have to prove anything to you lol.  How many people used it is irrelevant are you going to froth at the mouth about damage meters or cast bars or literally any addon?  Theyre all going to be more used now than they were in vanilla.
---
Your arguments just prove you're triggered by the fact that it says lfg and you literally have no clue what you're talking about.
---
It does NOT search and automatically builds a group for you. It's said that you actually got high voted while stating something that is plain wrong.
---
Shit, I hadn't even thought of it that way. Getting a head start on leveling mining!
---
I want you to stop caring what I do, or do not.
---
If that doesn't last long enough, set her up with BOTW, that should keep her distracted.

It's not even about some oldschool names these people used before Classic WoW. A lot of people already joined guilds using certain nicknames, people are socializing on discords under certain nicks and so on.
---
You mean auto invites that have been part of PvE raid addons like DBM or Bigwigs since Vanilla?
---
Fake and gay
---
Good luck! See you in classic.
---
That wasn't until Wrath, right?  Shame as it meand I'll be paying out the nose every raid night to switch between SM-Ruin and my solo-elite dungeon farming spec of Nightfall-Soul Link
---
Again, #nochanges but daddy's gonna have to farm hardcore
---
There’s been a few posts like this one. It’s always devastating. What was your name? Because some of them were quite obscure and still got taken in the minutes it took to create a new character.
---
This is like writing down the wrong year, which I annually do well into the spring. You keep doing it because brain no good
---
Literally laughed out loud at this god I missed this shit
---
100% agree. Classic is all about the community of the server you're playing on. Someone's toxic? They'll likely have a hard time finding a group after word gets out that *person x* acts this way in groups. I'm so excited for the level of community that Classic demands.
---
When your entire Steam library is undermined by a 15 year old game.
---
I breathed out my nose heavily to this
---
Yea probably best not to fake your death just to avoid your wife.
---
The author said they were working on an arrow and other QoL updates right around the stress test as well.
---
Draenei were an excuse to give Alliance shaman, but the ugly Frozen Throne draenei would have been out of place in the alliance.  Belfs kinda made sense for the Horde though since they already had bad blood with the humans and night elves.
---
They will be able to, there will just be a queue. Afaik blizzard isnt going to "lock" servers.
---
i don’t really do voidwalker until later because imp is so good. maybe when i leave for wetlands i would do voidwalker before i go, so around 13-14. the princess quest is crucial in the speed run but if you aren’t speed running it i would say you could batch those. you’d have to do stormwind shipment or grind for 10 to make up for the princess XP, because i doubt the pickup contract from gnolls would make up for it (210xp). great question though! if you’re playing on faerlina i’ll be seeing you out there haha
---
Can you prove this? The survey says otherwise.
---
Were you in my guild and are you talking about me? Lol I was on dragonmaw us
---
A bit different when those addons were based around the endgame raiding content which eas between a guild usually. Once you have a guild you have already formed a social connection. That argument is a bit moot.
---
If they are charged what the 2nd highest bidder amount, wont that encourage people with a larger DKP stack to bid the max that they can knowing the next closest person can’t touch them and they won’t lose their actual bid amount?
---
After the bids are done, will there be transparency following what the actual winning and remaining bids were?  I was in a guild in Vanilla that bid this way that eventually broke up because several officers basically would lie about bids, effectively making it a loot council (which is fine if you know it going in). 
---
I otherwise like it.

Is there a difference between how retail and classic will handle latency? I'm studying abroad for a couple of years and 300 ping was fine on retail, will I be in a tougher spot for classic?

---
Gamers have 2 jokes
---
Care to share your secrets?
---
It just doesn't make sense. Take hit rating for example, on a 2h fury warrior. He needs 9% hit to cap yellows, so until 9 hit rating is the best stat he can pick up off an item. But once he hits 9% hit rating becomes a "dead" stat not adding anything additional. 
---
Like is most going to go through the trouble of factoring the person's spec, content phase, dungeon/ raid? I mean what's the item weight of FR gear on a Offtank for Lucifron?
---
And my bow!
---
Nothing difficult about spamming or trying to scan the rapidly moving world chat with hawkeyes to find a group or members. It's just inconvenient and timewasting.
---
your going against thousands of other players that have also taken off work 
---
blizzard already warn us about 10,000 player long queue on full servers 
---
it just a protip to never take time off work on a launch of an mmorpg. wait a few weeks in when the server are stable and get the best out of your va"mmo"cation. :)
---
Jesus. 30 hours per week is just over four hours per day! If that's semi-hardcore, what the heck is hardcore?

They may not function the same on a base level but they accomplish the same goal, in regards to classic.
---
You can’t get any gear in classic you didn’t participate in, there is no magic box every week to give you a max ilvl weapon from a raid you’ve never entered.  
---
I get what you’re saying, but they have the same end result.
---
As far as delusions of community, I was there, a lot of people were there, you may not have been old enough or even alive to have been there. The community at large continues to ring the community bell, there is no delusion. The community is arguably the most important thing in classic. Gearscore will repeat the negative effects it had on the community.
---
Something tells me it will. It’s one thing to sit here now and say “we’re committed already” but when the game launches and the queue says something absurd like four hours, minds are going to change quick.
---
Unfortunately, I can't exactly take time off of high school even though the year just started.
---
Don't have plans for exercise, other than maybe clearing off the treadmill and putting my laptop on the treadmill desk to play Classic.

And of course, my advice for all of ya is to play however you want, except for all the ways that I disagree with. Take that however you'd like. :P
---
Divorced 4 years ago. I’m good.
---
The more hardcore players are going to be the more likely players to push through the vanilla leveling grind. Casual players are not likely going to be willing to push through the 2 month grind just to get to level 60. Why would you want to play on the server that doesn't have the best chances of letting you succeed?
---
I am disappointed that Arugal isn't full, but it's the best option that Oceanic players have. Most players from Oceanic will be there (Frostmourne and Barthilas are the main Oceanic servers, and both are PvP even though they do very well in PvE as well). Having more players to do dungeons with, farm mats/items that will end up on the AH and a wider variety of guilds will make the game a better experience for everyone.
---
why the fuck would someone play classic... and then get this addon? its like counter-intuitive.
---
Dungeon Finder was basically panned as one of the largest contributors to everything that stood against what classic stood for... it killed community.
---
Actions do have consequences, Stalagg looks like a spineless shit server from this action.
---
Yea so at that point it’s just two people needing an item and he who wins it wins it right? Nothing you can do after that it seems
---
Hmm yeah good point, too close to 30 you risk delays and too close to 25 you risk queues....
---
I have also entertained an alternate universe narrative branching from classic.
---
Skinning is super nice since you can vandor a lot of the early skins for cash, and then sell the later skins you get.
---
You think to much. Just try it.
---
If you’re male roll male my dude
---
Small part? Did you read the comment he replied to? Finding a group can take longer than completing the actual dungeon, which was the point. If someone sucks, you're more inclined to communicate how they can improve rather than wait another 30 minutes. Which is exactly why this post exists.
---
You could apply the exact same logic to character names. Yet look hoe many people subbed to reserve a name AND pick a server.
---
So once your hated on one server you just server hop by before you do create a new toon woth your name so you get a free name change, so what you are saying is you want ninja looters griefers and all them bad players to have a free out... no, no to server transfers at all same with name changing go play retail if you want to jump to different servers
---
Not to rain on anyone's parade but even without an addon, idk if this is the same but in GW2 for fractals they didn't have a LFG function for it during release so people instead just used an external website so I can see the same happening here even if there was no addon tbh.
---
So ridiculous. This exact fucking mod existed in Vanilla. It has been around since very close to the beginning and was one of the earliest mods. Did it ruin the game for you the first time around?
---
Truer, sadder words have never been spoken.
---
An lfg addon isn't new
---
It does. Doesn't mean that Remulos is 'dead'.
---
Season 1 starting August 26th
---
Where is that?
---
Hi
---
Finally a an actual constructive post about the addon that isn't just "Blizzard Break it/Ban it" or "Just don't use it".  
---
\&gt; As long as the addon can parse chat, it can function as described above.   
---
Most important line right here folks. To the people saying "Break/Ban it": First off, Blizzard doesn't "ban" addons, if they have a problem with the functionality of an addon they will change the addon API, essentially breaking the functionality. They can probably change the auto-invite functionality but \*\*as long as addon API can parse chat they can't remove the core functionality of an addon like this\*\*.  
---
For the record I personally don't plan on using addons like these (depends on how readable LFG chat is at the start). But losing your mind over this as some kind of slippery slope to retail wow is making a mountain out of a molehill.
---
I'm rolling a warrior and plan on going protection spec at level 50+
---
I'm so ready for all the whispers lol, at least I can actually tank though...when I feel like it
---
He looks so mischievous
---
Maybe lazy was the wrong term to use lol. I know some people don’t do farming professions, I have a buddy that will be rolling tailoring and enchanting for example. So he will be purchasing his own things you’re right
---
&gt;spoken as someone that didn't actually play hunter at a high level.
---
Played one for years until I could no longer tolerate how mundane and simplistic it was. Of course Blizzard's incessant pruning and removal of anything that gave the class even the slightest bit of flavor did not help.
---
We got Arugal here in OCE, sounds like some kind of salad tbh
---
I can't wait for people ingame to stop baiting with the ol "where are my heirlooms." Heard that shit like 10 times during the stress test.
---
I gotta ask, why are your rolling on an RP server if you don't RP?
---
Not having a go at all, I'm just generally curious?
---
Yea if you announce while puging up that something is reserved and they agree that seems reasonable to me. Or I guess with the addon you tell them right when they group up and they don’t leave that seems fine too.
---
100% this. I just got hired at a new job, listed my education and degrees. There's no verification, GPA check, etc, etc. As long as you have that piece of paper IN CASE they ask, you're fine. Embellished on my minors, they didn't give a fuck. GPA don't mean shit in the real world and your degree's only matter in the rare chance that they ask for proof.
---
they got 1st rag twice.

Please describe how relationships were built in trade chat spam. Then please describe how those relationships built in trade chat spam were anywhere near as impactful as the relationships formed by actually traveling to and running the instance with your group.
---
I'll wait.

He had a pink mohawk too. When he created his character, he was using the monitor that was kind of junky and he thought it was red.
---
There was no reason to talk to one another therefore they didn not.
---
Yes, I want to be forced to talk to people by the game. If you do not communicate in classic WoW, you should not succeed. That involves the very basic steps of forming a group.  
---
If somebody has a high enough itemlevel, they won't be a liability in 99% of the cases, because they know the dungeons and mistakes can be nuked by just bruteforcing the dungeon.
---
Therefore there is no reason to vet people before a group invite if they are geared enough.
---
Classic WoW is all about being forced to do stuff.
---
Forced to talk.
---
Force to venture out in the world instead of camping the capital city.
---
Forced to socizalize.
---
Take this weeb shit back to /r/ffxiv
---
The Warden is a lvl19 gnome rogue twink
---
I don't remotely get the hate. It doesn't auto-group you. It will only work on the same realm. You still have to actually run TO the instance AND communicate as you run it since they're not faceroll dungeons. 
---
What it does is eliminate global chat spam and endless /who searches. I probably won't even use it since I go very light touch with the add-ons, but the pitchfork mentality is beyond me. 
---
Is there some reason why you're so vocally against it?
---
The Dawn of Ruin.
---
&gt; Slippery Slope Fallacy - is a logical fallacy in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect.
---
Your original comment is a slippery slope fallacy. Starts off with just a simple automated grouping system. 
---
Next thing you know you'll want mobs to die faster. 
---
Next thing you know they'll just give you XP so you can level faster. 
---
&gt; Again, the functionality of an LFD was not something intended for this version of the game and is a huge reason why people prefer a version without it.
---
No, people are stuck on the idea that purity is what is important. Purity above anything else. When that is your stance, you don't have to think critically about the topic because your choice has been made. It shuts down discussion. 
---
Most are not even asking why someone wants something like this. 
---
Most don't even know the problems that this system has. 
---
To top it all off, Blizzard is saying that most servers are going to be ***massive*** in terms of population. The odds of you recognizing players and "leveling with them" is going to likely not be a thing.
---
Gotcha, definitely going to try and do most dungeons since we’re not really trying to be efficient and just wanna hang.
---
Hm, I just read about spell batching but not sure I understand it correctly. If I use a skill, it takes 300ms to reach their server, and then it is added to the actions that will be performed in the next batch (every 400 seconds is a new batch)? Meaning if it comes just too late for one batch, I may have to wait 300+400=700ms at the maximum? 
---
And if it arrives like 1 ms before a batch is launched, I would experience only 301s latency?
---
Usually the population for pvp servers leans towards the Horde and pve servers the Alliance has the numbers. That is the best way the early gauge the faction population until the Census add-on data can be pulled and uploaded.
---

---
It doesn't break any TOS. Don't download it. Problem solved.
---
Please play on the server and report back to me in 2 months then :)
---
If it works out like that in the long run then go for it. The only thing holding a dagger rogue back from leveling is needing to be behind a target, so if that's covered then you're golden.
---
it aint my first rodeo man and 30min-3hour is on a good estate 
---
i hope everyone who took PTO to play wow classic get to play as much as possible and never wait on queue and never get DC due to over crowded servers , or server crash.
---
Underrated
---
Why didnt you update Realm Forums when we got server names? Forum is dead.
---
....No. Not without serious repercussion on other addons or without a major update of their API.
---
This mod does BASIC stuff. Read the chat, invite people who send me.
---
there is no reason not to level first aid, and if you are in a dungeon u can heal in combat so healer can focus on tank or if you are the healer u can save mana healing yourself
---
He was talking about retail and recently they increased a lot how many characters you can have in the same realm, because of these many classes and races you know, in no way I was talking about classic or vanilla
---
No it didn’t ruin my experience the first time because it wasn’t prevalent and didn’t become the default norm but I would argue it has a bigger chance to become the norm this time around because of the ubiquity of dungeon finders in modern MMOs these days.
---
I think they can check institution and degree, that's it.  Did blah blah graduate there in 1991, yep. End of validation check.
---
***whoosh***
---
Sounds like a spell in Harry Potter.
---
And in Azeroth bind them
---
Gonna chill w/ my friend on Fairbanks it seems.
---
The more I see these hunter need memes, the more I want to make a hunter and just need on everything. Just because.
---
If your not set on Alliance than maybe try out a shaman?
---
This is true and people need to accept that the game will never be the same as it was, even a lot of OG's from vanilla will make and use addons like this to the point it becomes the norm to use them.
---
And my wand. (waving it menacingly)
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
Haha, but thats one of the fun parts of the game! While I didn’t like the latest patch, the did a good job adding more complexity to that tree this last league. 
---
It honestly reminds of of FF I0, that too had a massive passive tree you had to navigate. I can see how it could be daunting on a new player.
---

---
Druid isn't a class for plebs
---
That world chat spamming makes the server and world feel more alive. Also since it’s now harder to find/create a group you appreciate them more and are more likely communicate with them and work through issues vs leaving and hopping back on the addon to find the next group.
---
Or go to any innkeeper. Compared to the addon in question it took you some walking to access the LFG.
---
Yeah this is what I don't get. It only remotes a very tiny part of the process.
---
This is a human person reminding you to read the thread before posting.
---
Oh christ, I can just imagine the streets being full of 30 year olds and a geriatric Ninja all flossing out of sync
---
You were still able to reserve names though?
---
we are suspecting this actually
---
Not using it. If nobody uses it the problem is solved. Heroin was new technology and not everyone uses it. LFG is as bad as heroin with less positives. LFG causes aids in 90% of all instances.
---
I've been worrying a bit about which server to play on, but it occurred to me that even the lowest population ones are still probably going to be way larger than any of the private servers I've played on.
---
This is gonna be so fun.
---
Looks like moonglade i think
---
Yeah my girlfriend is not happy about this lol
---
Ya blind bids do sort of mess with new people. They won't quite understand the value of stuff.
---
They may start relying on that dkp return and start screwing each other over lol.
---
Googled it...im pretty sure it was the Warden Staff. Lol 48 purp. Got it off those asshole trolls in the hinterlands. It was the forst world drop purp I had found and was extra pumped just to have found it (even though I couldn't ise it) and even more pumped to sell it as I still owed my one friend after he loaned me a bit of coin for my lol 40 kitty.
---
You're fired, again!
---
I swear half the children crying about changes hear don't actually know what they are complaining about.
---
Not going to use the add-on myself buy how in the fuck is spamming chat automatically changing the core experience?
---
Yea I hear ya Were planning on the same thing. I am 100% certain I want to casually level a rogue and mage and had thoughts of feral Druid, but feral seems pretty underwhelming so I’m skipping the idea of making one ... at least for now.
---
isn't blizzards goal to disable these addons anyways
---
Herb for mat gathering for raid pots then enchanting for DE and recipe gathering to get dem tips. Nilla has so many awesome enchants from factions and drops.
---
Never used a gun on my Nelf hunter.. just doesn't fit him!
---
I think you will be severely disappointed by your mama pool.
---
Yes OP. The ability to get that quest item or dungeon drop that dramatically improves your performance, or getting that extra level, making it easier to complete a quest is what it’s all about. 
---
Once they removed the ability to grind boars in the forest and they started scaling with your level, the world didn’t seem as fun.
---
A lot of people on this sub have never played Vanilla other than on private servers.
---
but if you're someone who doesnt pay attention to world chat, you wont have the ninja on ignore. Now he whispers you and get the invite.
---
you're missing out on world chat news, gossips, rumor, reputations, blacklisted names, etc..
---
It is not an advantage if most players are not using it.
---
This could work as an OSRS art piece pretty well. I see dragon boots, bandos, and a gmaul spec on a goblin.
---
It’s not new, and it’s not going to be capable of doing anything THAT integral. Those who don’t want to use it will do just fine with out.
---
Frankly I find it odd how people are caping for an add on. It’s one thing to dislike what it does, but some of y’all really seem to have a stake in it succeeding.
---
TLDR, the answer is still yes yes yes yes!!!!
---
Not only that, but the LFG chat channel is going to be global from the start of classic. I don't think many people actually remember wow classic, or they just want to force their experience onto others. Play the game how it was and that includes addons that were available in the original vanilla for LFG (such as CTA).
---
I thought this comment chain was still about the South Park WoW episode and was very very confused.
---
I definitely won't be using one. Part of the fun for me was actually searching for a group, it was more interactive, more personal, more satisfying when you actually pulled a group together, even if it took longer and required more work. I don't want the game to do everything for me, retail has enough of that already.
---
I was in this train of thought too when I first played during Cata, but BFA and other users made me realize that it creates a systemic issue.
---
LFG makes everyone else pretty dispensable. If someone sucks, fuck 'em, take a quick break while you replace queue them. Since it's relatively easier to get a group together, it's probably more efficient to kick someone and queue back up than to stick it out with a slightly rude or below-average player. I think LFG helps cultivate this "I'm the only one that matters" mentality that runs rampant in retail
---
Too much. 
---
But 21:9 is worth it. But today i would go fir a cheaper one.there is one from msi. Its half the price of mine.
---
I'm doing my part!
---
Yes! 
---
I can still remember names of players back in Vanilla through mid-wrath that had a terrible reputation, or the same few people spamming chat with chuck norris jokes.  On Alliance side “Sen-jin” server there was a guy named “Conway” that would just spam chat talking about himself in the 3rd person for hours. I think he was perpetually at level 23. 
---
Today I can’t tell you the name of a single player in my BFA guild.
---
My roommate in college played this over and over to bug me because he thought I was playing a kids game while he played SW Galaxy
---
This is the best part imo, I'll have a chance at getting my names on a lower pop server which is exactly what it would take for me to migrate. I had an idea of free instant character migrations in the days leading up to launch but this works just as well if not better
---
Why is this tagged as humor?
---
Btw thanks for the feedback. We all get downvotes.
---
Gearscore itself probably won’t be in vanilla but spamming your ilvl is, and that comes back to it.
---
Already skipped over gearscore and straight to retails version. Ilvl is touchy because of the crazy itemization the game has.
---
It’s just not the ruler or scale I want to see permeate classic servers and truly take away from the game more than it gives.
---
Yeah, there's really no point when players can just coordinate together shortly after launch based on what new servers are turned on.
---
he's not wrong
---
Cool vid, but u stole half the vid from someone else :(
---
Honestly it doesn't matter, if not this they will just make an LFG discord.
---
I don’t care what your ilvl is, are you hit capped?
---
Not true, there are many tooltip addons that add ilvl for mousing over items (for 1.12 client private realms), I imagine it won't be any different for classic wow. I know because I use one.
---
&gt; They just blindly follow what some pro told them
---
This is the worst part.  The pros are good enough to take advantage of the mechanics that make certain things good for them.  The vast majority of people aren't good enough to take advantage of whatever mechanic that is.
---
Cool. PvP definitely. Alli it is
---
I found the dps rotation pretty simplistic for PVE, I will agree. The only really important skill in PVE was shot weaving and combat trapping for dungeons. Also there were a lot of boring rotations in vanilla; Holy paly, resto druid spamming literally one heal spell, mage spamming one spell, ditto for warlock spamming shadowbolt, in fact comparing it to the aimed/multi-shot rotation while shot weaving and removing enrages seems alright to me as its not nearly as simplistic as some other classic rotations (No offense meant to other classes btw, just using it as comparison's sake)
---
THIS IS AMAZING
---
The leveling in Vanilla was actually quite enjoyable in my opinion. You should give it an even chance! It’s much better tuned than any mmo currently on the market. Full of adventure and challenge and exploration.
---
As long as it isn't teleporting people to instances (impossible) then I don't see the problem.  I would also expect it to have fairly limited use if the addons even pick up traction.
---
I would 100% agree if blizz were to do something about it, but honestly I also wouldn't care if they did nothing unless it becomes a problem.
---
People said the same thing about GearScore, and look how well that turned out... now retail is only about your gear numbers, not about your ability.
---
If it had ilvl / gear score placement I would understand, but this addon only auto invites people who whisper you. I don't see why Blizzard would have a problem with that. A lot of people are going to be setting up LFG macro's anyways. Why not let them use an addon to simplify the process? It's the same reason Call to Arms was so popular in vanilla. People want it and it doesn't break the experience.
---
the world PvP. RP/PvP servers are known for having the best world PvP.

What
---
Definitely agree which is why we decided silent bidding. In OPEN bidding you have a lot more (whispering) collusion and they can see if someone is going to backstab them and bid anyways. With closed at least if they do collude they'll be more paranoid because they won't know if everyone truly isn't bidding until bidding closes. I think this would reduce collusion vs an open bidding system.
---
Such a good game. She'll be playing quality.
---
Its always been a thing
---
"Grow a clue" oh boy, I better go do that. 
---
Notable differences between your example and this add-on:
---
1) I played from April 2005-Wrath and I literally never heard of anyone using or talking about CallToArms. It simply was not a popular add-on.
---
Conversely, this one is featured on IcyVeins right now (which has a direct link from the Blizzard resources page). People would actually use this, especially those coming from modern WoW.
---
2) As mentioned by Ion, to capture the spirit of Classic WoW, Blizzard will have to closely curate what features are "added back" to the game *after being purposefully removed*. This means that "authentic" means more than just something did or did not exist during Vanilla.
---
Good luck with that, ill be getting bear asses on eastern kingdoms
---
Games have always been about  min maxing. 2019 brings us more tools to min mix. If you want a authentic experience, open up a private server and play with your friends with any addon or outside influence.
---
I like PoE but I get sick of playing a game where your character mostly just spams 1 main attack ability all game and little else other than movement. I say that as I roll a mage...lol
---
That is actually quite different. Crucially, it does not exclude those who do not use the addon
---
I'd rather see all of azeroths inhabitants on one boat just crashing the server but hey to one their own
---
But if you already ignored those chats, why would the addon change anything, would those players automaticly read every single chat message without it? after reading about the addon i plan to use it without auto invite feature because its really stupid to to invite players without any kind of filter and a chat filter does not affect other player.
---
Posting [this](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2552) from the other thread about the topic because its relevant.
---
Even Blizzard is skeptical of the addon - Im sure its being looked at.
---
On the 20mans 1 bid, is that gonna be off spec+mainspec for bids?  Or just ignoring off spec like on the 40mans?  Just wondering.
---
Not raging or crying. Why do proponents of the addon always characterize opponents of the addon as raging and crying? 
---
To what extent was CallToArms used?
---
That's cool. I see that someone does not
---
Hit capped and you have a threat meter?

Bael Modan was once a part of the lands that served as home and provider to the Stonespire tribe. It was the ancestral birthplace of many of them. Then the dwarves of Bael'dun came and began their disruptive excavation operations, forcing the tauren out and killing many innocent who opposed. The tauren tried to approach the dwarves to reach a diplomatic resolution, but it failed.
---
Probably not in this case everyone will probably just be picking whatever sounds like it will have a sane population and have the highest number of folks who speak their language.
---
so the OP is quoting the unabomber, you're comparing it to fucking heroin. 
---
What's next evil thing this video game addon will be responsible for? 
---
Lets see if we can get the next mass shooter perpetrator to claim it was be the only reasonable action becuase of [ClassicLFG](https://i.imgur.com/qbNCs1l.jpg)!
---
&gt; Just because you had to sit in a major city to form a group 15 years ago doesn’t mean it’s the best scenario.
---
But you never even had to do that.  at launch you could literally /join 'Ironforge - Trade'  from any zone.  and when they patched that out they added a global LookingForGroup.
---
They even had these exact type of mods in vanilla, and no one used them because they are just trashy versions of /join LookingForGroup
---
Lol yeah a lot of us are. Haven't done anything myself to prepare but ask questions. Oh also bought some much needed upgrades for my computer.
---
Welcome and loktar ogar!
---
There's no point in worrying about something that's virtually guarantee.
---
Which is why I said personally. And that's just me. Several times. I just wanted to let the guy know that not everyone would be dicks about it. I, personally, just me, myself, only speaking for me, would not mind it.
---
I love it when Alliance justify their war crimes by saying the tauren were clearly in the wrong for attacking assholes that dug up their sacred burial grounds after diplomatic negotiations failed.
---
God I hated that
---
I’m down for not spamming in /2.
---
Yes, and in those cases, they are looking for did you lie. So you can have a DUI , just declare it, don't lie about it. In the section , have you ever been convicted of  a crime.
---
I think it was a webcomic, and it eventually became an actual quest.
---
My gf is taking me out for sushi and we're getting pedi's done on Sunday. The GFs/Wives of Classic players are the real MvP's

Welcome!
---
Better call to ban [Leatrix](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic) since it has the same function. It’s a classic update of a vanilla addons that did the EXACT same auto invite function from whispers. Which was great to get invited to the 40 man raids. 123 to the raid leader and boom you’re in the raid. Hopefully there’s no other call to arms type addon that consolidated the LFG spam into any easy to read list which was also available in vanilla.
---
While i agree in most part with what you say. Remember that people are (insert you prefered insult here) and there are s lot of trolls too. And with with the time commidment a 5man can take. Having a guy that is really lazy just becouse he knows people wont kick him boucouse geting  a new player will take a lot of time (going to the city. Geting a new player and going back to the instance). That happened to me a few time in bc back in the day(and whe had summoning stones at that time). And while it migth reduce social interaction a little. I dont think it will that bad  but i migth be wrong
---
I’m right there with you but it’s a thing on private servers and retail, classic will be spoiled with it, and not for the better
---
I'm not talking about the time it takes but rather how much actual interaction happens. If there's no one around to join your group then obviously there's no interaction. Oftentimes groups fell apart before even starting the dungeon because some spot wasn't filled quick enough. As with all stuff in Classic your reputation matters.
---
Having someone stick around when he'd normally leave after the first wipe just because it took longer to form the group is wishful thinking. They'll ditch either way and even though reputation means a lot in Classic the size of the realms make it easier for people to be assholes without repercussions.
---
I could see this as well
---
. In reality you’ll take what you get, right? I doubt either of will care who we bring after spamming world chat for 40mins
---
Aight then, guess i'm going somewhere else
---
Female orcs look better in anything over male orcs.
---
Could of at least hid your UI...
---
It has no effect on my choices
---
You can run to their starting area :) This is extra good if you want to eventually get their races class mount as well.
---
You clearly haven’t heard of Grob
---
I love their laugh, it's so genuine.
---
Reminds me of my FFXI days.
---
Lol you saw monitor in the title and listed what you got.
---
This addon ain’t it chief
---
I can't believe you've done this.
---
I'm not a physicist but I am a hobbyist photographer. Those filters basically "warm up" the color or shift them on the color spectrum from blue to a yellow. This will cut down on a lot of blue light but it won't cut down everything.
---
Glasses will cut down or block whatever percentage they are rated for. 
---
I guess I'm more privy to wearing glasses because I have done genetic testing which shows I have a gene deviant that says I'm more susceptible to age-related macular degeneration so I use yellow glasses as a precaution to a lack of scientific data on the longterm effects of bluelight from digital devices.  Anecdotally my eyes feel less strained If I'm on the computer for longer than 2-3 hours. 
---
f.lux probably works well enough for most people, I just personally prefer the color of glasses vs the software.
---
Blamo is the wayo
---
I'm honestly amazed by the number of people who forgot how popular CTA was in Vanilla lol.
---
its not going to stay low pop.   
---
many people havent even subbed yet. not to include blizzard confirmed making server xfers highly possible by the end of phase 1 if populations are still too high on some realms.
---
Gandling, here I come!
---
Forrest Gump, naice
---
I'm just gonna paste in some comments I made to someone else asking about Shaman :)
---
--------------------------------------------------------
---
I leveled as Elemental in Vanilla :)
---
The rotations and main skills are far simpler than retail, you just have less of them basically. However, totems are *nothing* like the dumb trinket-like system in Retail. You have one for most situations, some of which are on a cooldown but most are not. They can and should be used all the time.
---
The downside of this flexibility is the micromanagement. Shaman eventually got a 'totem bar' which allowed us to predefine sets of 4 totems to drop in a single action, and we could also recall them. This system doesn't exist in Classic, so you have to drop them one-by-one and you can't recall them (except by planting a totem of the same element somewhere else). It's not uncommon for a forgotten totem to pull adds for you :x
---
Elemental damage is actually pretty good, but the spec isn't popular in end game PvE because it goes OoM pretty easily and tends to be very turret-y as well. Outside of raid content you'll be fine though. You can also heal in instances while leveling, although obviously that gets harder the closer you get to Lv60 without being Resto.
---
Elemental is a lot of fun in PvP, as you have decent burst and are a lot tankier than your average caster. Dropping a big Chain Lightning crit is very satisfying. Probably the biggest negative here is that people can and will target your totems.
---
Raiding in Classic will be Resto, and it's not very exciting. You have a small heal, a bigger heal, a chain heal, and a 31pt Resto totem that you'll drop for other casters in the raid.
---
I say go for it!
---
EDIT: Also I don't know if these are a thing in Retail but in Classic you can self revive once every hour, and you also have Astral Recall which acts as a hearthstone on a much shorter cooldown.
---
----------------------------------------------------------------------
---
&gt; What was it like leveling as ele?
---
A lot of fun. Mana was never an issue for me across these short fights. I always used totems, big fan of Searing (like having a mini Warlock imp that doesn't go OoM). The mana and healing spring weren't worth dropping unless you planned to be staying there for more than a single mob. Some people don't bother but in my opinion if you're not using your totems or don't like micro, you're playing the wrong class.
---
&gt; Specifically what were your gear choices?
---
Couldn't tell you that exactly, way too long ago now and sadly I lost all my pre-BC screenshots years ago. I know I stacked INT of course and stuck to wearing leather/mail (after Lv40). I mostly ran 1H + shield for the tankiness, because even as Ele you could still slap a bitch up close if you needed to, with Lightning Shield, Shocks, elemental weapon buffs and your aoe fire totems all making things painful. I was Tauren so I had War Stomp if things got dicey as well. On that note- back in Classic, Orc's Blood Fury is strictly a melee attack buff, so 3/4 of their racials are useless as Ele. Trolls have Berserking, mildly better passive HP regen and deal 5% more damage to beasts.
---
&gt; I want to level as an ele/resto shaman.
---
And you totally can. An early Resto talent extends the range of your friendly totems to 30yds (up from 20), which is a must-have for groups. The major decision you have to make is whether you want Elemental Mastery (31pt Ele) or Nature's Swiftness (21pt Resto)-
---
- EM gives you a free *damage* spell w/ guaranteed crit every 3mins
---
- NS gives you an instant spell every 3mins
---
EM is better for raw output, particularly when coupled with a trinket of some kind, but NS is more flexible (can use it to heal OR damage). Both are good, personally I went with EM. One other benefit of EM is that you have the option of taking 7pts out of Resto and put them in Enh, losing 1% hit and 5% crit but gaining 5% mana/better shield blocking and taking the Ghost Wolf cast down to 1sec (from 3sec). You don't have that option if you go NS because you'd lose way too much taking those 7pts out of Ele. Technically though you can make Ghost Wolf instant with NS if you *really* need to get moving...
---
EDIT: Should also add, each Chain Lightning bounce has an independent chance to crit. EM makes *the entire thing* crit.
---
What word? Censorship? Do you know what it means?
---
"the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security."
---
Banning people that haven't done anything is suppression of people that areconsidered obscene. 
---
Its literally the actual definition.
---
I was just typing "What kind of weeb shit is this?", then I saw your comment :D
---
Thanks, 2 hours 26 minutes is exactly when he starts talking about cast bar addons. I got lucky while skipping through haha
---
My wife is leaving the country for a holiday with her best friend. This happens for all WoW expansions.
---
For real. I left Arygos for Bronzebeard simply because it was a cooler name to say.
---
You got your wish, Incendius
---
I feel like getting Blizzard to police addons because of knee-jerk reaction from a bunch of turbo-nerds is in direct conflict with the spirit of vanilla.
---
Now do Bigglesworth
---
Who is the monster responsible for this?
---
Yes, please break this addon.
---
Kinda makes me feel like im not putting in enough work compared to every1 else haha but i kinda wanna hit it blind again like i did back in the day being a noob at a game to me is part of the fun
---
I did it in a priv server up to about lvl 45.  We were both able to stay current, but we may have grinded on good beast spots a little more than we would have otherwise done.
---
We just did it because we weren't going to switch over to the other skills until higher lvls.
---
Auto-invite is not the same as automatic matchmaking.      
---
It's only "automatic" for the group leader, everyone that gets invited has to either press a button or send a whisper to the group leader.
---
The auto-invite checks whispers for keywords and writes "/inv (name of whoever wrote the keyword)" in the chat.
---
You can quote Ion for this who said more or less the exact same thing.
---
heal
---
I’m convinced Blizzard picked these server names just to entice people from the full servers to switch. Incendius sounds a lot cooler than Faerlina.
---
Weast? Anyone?
---
Bud the game hasn't even released and you are worried about something that won't happen for at least 1.5 years. Table these thoughts for later when Blizzard starts engaging the community about where to take this project after P6.
---
The only reason I am not playing mage in classic is because I played one in Vanilla and I played it the most through all the expansions. They are great, you wont regret playing one. They have a surprising variation of builds for doing essentially the same thing, burst damaging opponents. Frost is slows and control, fire is more burst, arcane is utility. I had fun with all the specs and if they ever move on to Burning Crusade I highly recommend for and arcane specs in PvE. I was not well geared and was blowing other DPS classes out of the water in raids.
---
In summary: be kind to others.
---
i posted a way to fix it above.
---
It only got elitist because most people stuck around from vanilla. Communities and tribes were set and people had an expectation by then. Imo at least
---
Lol like 10 years ago
---
I do miss soo parts of 11. But the grinds and lack of addon help for crafting killed a lot of stuff for me.
---
Going to character select ≠ logging out. You won't need to queue multiple times.
---
We have no idea how it will work and its meaningless to worry about it right now. Blizzard doesn't even know if TBC will happen, they are just watching their pocketbook and gauging interest. 
---
When the times comes maybe everyone does get forced but I suspect it would be more of an opt your character in thing.
---
Idk what's the problem, it would only sound really sarcastic said by a shadow priest.
---
You expect me to have numbers on addon usage?  
---
Like i said; knowledge of these addons spread slower and by word of mouth back then, but they existed and were very much alive and used.  
---
You did apparently not know of them or use them, so you want to force your views on everyone else.  
---
And what about those of us that did know about them, and did use them?  
---
You want to impose changes that were simply not there during vanilla.
---
I solved that problem a long time ago. Deposit lots and lots of cash for a retail store, and write dates in the form of 22 Jan 2019 - the trick is, by the time you write down the month, you have noted to yourself about the roll over, and as you write down the year, you just increment what you wrote for Dec and you are good to go.
---
This format for a date also has a benefit: It can NEVER be confused as to what you are referring.
---
those throll necklaces
---
Zoiks Scoob!
---
Some people on this sub literally start having a seizure when an addon appears that they don't understand.. eapecially if it has a forbidden word like lfg
---
I'm almost positive, the queue is to get to your character screen...
---
Just don't exit the game...
---
&gt;Classic has pretty terrible itemization, and low ilvl gear can be best in slot for a long time. 
---
It's like you've never played the game. 
---
Vanilla had the best itemization and because of this gearscore is pointless in classic. ilvl is literally meaningless in classic and  in retail it's literally the only thing that matters. That alone should tell you that your concern is pointless.
---
I guess writing in general and inviting players is too hard these days
---
Count me in... I want all that crap out of my classic experience!
---
Group finder is literally one of the most disliked things by classic players, certainly this is not hard to understand.
---
Whenever you think of something and thing, wow this makes doing X way easier, that's the kind of stuff that a lot of us think hurt the game for what we want. I play retail and love a ton about it, but I also get why that stuff that I love hurts part of the game. I use dungeon finder some and I literally just hop in a group with randoms, port to the zone, and just run through aoeing in silence. It's fun in a lot of ways right, but at the end of it the only normal communication is lower lvls asking for the loot. This is just the genera experience. Obviously guys running tough dungeons communicate more and stuff but thats certainly more rare than not.

Yes, please get rid of it! Organic interactions and talking to people are something I miss from Vanilla
---
i do not get it, whats the big fuss about?
---
*guild with "Warrior" in the name*
---
To earn DKP so every raid you do you know your getting a peace
---
ah the sweet horde. think that they are so strong.
---
I'm beyond to hate you.
---
I have more compassion for you poor creatures. I only kill if you really want it.
---

---
The irony being that Hunters are the least gear whores in the entire game. 
---
Watch how greedy Paladins/warriors/Shamans are in Classic.
---
The most sound solution to this is add additional tbc servers for a separate launch that gives players the ability to transfer over their 60 character
---

---
I like all the ideas of been hearing . I'm cool with classic staying classic. I'm cool with classic getting its own  new stuff, like OLd School Runescape. And I'm cool with classic progressing to TBC.
---
Either way, I'll have fun.
---
Correct, but its going to take some time for new/distant players to remember when we had to pay the blood price for everything.  Give it time and be understanding of those who fret.  In fact, bookmark a YouTube video of one of the farms to send out when guildmates fret. It may not be the MOST polite answer, but certainly better than 'grow a pair' ;)
---
I'm expecting them to release NEW servers that will progress from classic to tbc over the course of 2 years.
---
It didn’t go away due to popularity though, it went away when people could be anonymous again, as per the post... Don’t get me wrong, I’m realist and understand times have changed, people will behave differently and the ‘social meta’ will have changed... but that Billy Joe might be in a two-hour long gnomeregan quest run, not your standard 15-minute daily heroic... and the chances of seeing him again are highly likely... but ive not said anything about wanting a truly authentic vanilla. WoW Classic is a brand new 2019 identity. 
---
What happens when the hype / population dies down?
---
Yea dude, when I started using the LFG tool in retail I left my guild because I couldn't think of any reason to stay.
---
/s
---
P.S. This comment has no reflection on whether LFG/LFR addons should exist or not.
---
Not fluent in English I can see, tell me how Thalnos works out mi amigo.
---
Oooor just offer character transfers and anybody that doesn't want to switch can deal with the queues. It's pretty simple and it's what Blizz has always done to full servers.
---
Jesus that [reference](https://youtu.be/kK2hqqh9Ww8) makes me lose it every time!
---
Also - yeast feast
---
That's the good thing. I would always stop to play WSG while mid leveling and would slow down my process. Now, I can focus on questing and getting to 60 before Warsong is out!
---
Y’all totally rock!!!
---
I created a guild with my friends who have jobs so we don't always have the same schedule. It also makes it easier for me to quest on alts. That's why I enjoyed using Call to Arms in vanilla and why I'll enjoy using ClassicLFG in classic.
---
You sweet sweet thing.
---
can’t leave out coffee tho
---
Bro, people are spamming ilvl for groups in private servers.
---
It’s not just my imagination, it’s a thing.
---
Damn. I don't think I've levelled tauren since vanilla.
---
Why? because you hate efficiency?
---
so passes the 100th thing that was going to kill vanilla wow
---
I've been playing since Vanilla release and still appreciate the convenience this addon is going to offer. Why would I waste more time with something that's keeping me from playing the content I'm interested in?
---
gotta love RPers
---
I'm not quite ready to retire yet. More toys and pets and mounts to collect.
---
But when I am done, I will head to the hidden orphanage among the northern mountains of Nagrand, and log out there. Until the end of time, my dear character will fill their lives with love and joy, with toys and pets and wonderful adventures.
---
They will never have to know war.
---
You mention it and get downvoted to the ground by people who didn’t play vanilla. Vqueue and CTA were hugely popular
---
Cute attempt to dismiss what he said, but it isn't a logical fallacy all the time. China started implementing CCTV cameras for security; recently the started adding facial recognition; then they added the social system to tie into it... or even the US's Patriot Act: it was designed to fight terrorism, and it's been used time and time again to enable things like NSA spying on citizens, and more. If those aren't slippery slopes, I don't know what is.
---
Why does he have full rage?

hi! this is super random but I saw from an archived thread ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/83c4bm/streaming\_from\_ps4\_to\_twitch\_issue/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/83c4bm/streaming_from_ps4_to_twitch_issue/)) that a year ago you had problems streaming on twitch from your PS4. were you ever able to figure it a solution? Im having the same issue...
---
There's a reason every culture has stereotypes.
---
No, I'm absolutely not playing on Shazzrah
---
I'm playibg minecraft. It helps.
---
For me it was Skyrim, Borderlands, and Mass Effects - plenty to replay and all the addons

Ooo and Monster Hunter international had me for a good long time but I always came back to WoW retail
---
Now I just wait... I’m dying slowly - The 27th is too far away

---
And they open on 26th... I guess I need to get those crayons for you after all, because you still are unable to understand current situation.
---
How come there's so many posts about this but nothing about the addon that shows what enemy's are casting which is super unfair to anyone with out it
---
FFXI you could flag yourself as looking for a group and add a note to clarify. You would then show up in searches.
---
I wish they would reboot FFXI as a single player game so I could add it to my collection of finished FF's
---
Autist
---
I'll use it and tell others about it
---
I know this sounds very dumb.  But honestly if you use the LFG/LFR addon why join a guild.  If anything I imagine it would be disadvantageous to you if you did.
---
You would be somewhat obligated to raid with a select group of people and they very well could suck at the game.  Wouldn't it be better just to be a pug? That way you could just use the addon to find raids.  You could use discord to socialize with a few friends.
---
I mean I really just see no reason what so ever to join a guild?
---
Not as much as healers specifically.
---
Oh for sure, I played primarily in vanilla and used many quality of life addons. But the appeal for me now is to play a game that isn’t holding your hand and doing all kinds of stuff for you. 
---
There were grouping addons back in the day, but my recollection is they weren’t particularly popular, other than ones to speed up raid invites.
---
The Kralnor post! Incredible touch.

there is a CD on layering

He's not wrong though. Look at the smart phone. It's practically mandatory now when all the stores are using smart phone coupon apps if you want to save money.  Also all applications are done via the internet now no more handing in paper.
---
Yeti horns. Jk none of them are pristine
---
Of course they can change the addon API.  Just protect the group invite functions so that addons can't do it.  Easy fix.
---
Cos these all existed to some extent in classic. Even if they were not used widely.
---
My wife couldn't care less. As long as I am there for her and my son when they need me and keep up performance at work (and the sack), she's all for it.

---
I'll be making a video about this shortly.

---
It doesn't just sound very dumb, it is!
---
What?
---
Not sure if [vQueue](https://github.com/christoabrown/vQueue) was in vanilla or developed later.
---
Looks like [Call to Arms](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4020-CallToArmsLFGAddOn.html) was.
---
Maybe for the first month or two but giving free transfers lets players with bad reputations get a free pass and a clean slate on a new server. At least if it's a paid service they have to pay for their bad decisions. Free or Paid transfers, there should be a long cool down every time you do it.
---
mograine is imo best name of em all
---
I last played a private server to 60 and raided in 2016. It was still good then
---
Best thing you can do for yourself is do some dungeons and run some Arathi Basin. This is Vanilla, most of the fun is going to come from the adventure and friends made. Max level will happen eventually.
---
why not just use discord? or some kind of other voip.  Just seems a waste of gold to do what it the way you described.
---
isn’t this repost?
---
Wow, i started losing keys on it over a decade ago. Plastic was too brittle.
---
The chain blades are the mobility weapons in that game but unfortunately they’re slow to progress because you need “cells” which are perks that you add to power up your defense/Offense/utility. 
---
Ive played a tiny bit of polearms cannon and their system is designed for wounding. You have stagger damage that stuns, part damage that breaks armor surrounding the monsters legs/arms, etc and then wound damage which makes the monster take more part damage.
---
At first I thought they were a support class but using the right perks, you can wound a part and then do 100% more damage vs that part and just demolish beast. 
---
The pole-arm also has a charge system which stacks 3 times. You deal damage and can bank a charge that can be used to blast a shot from your weapon. If the beast is doing a move that can be interrupted, it knocks them down and gives you time to dps. 
---
I personally loved chain blades more so i spent my time playing that first. But chain blades cant interrupt without +6 weighted strikes perks and it feels really bad doing high mobility fights without it.
---
If you want something to play till monday, give it a go. As far as mobility, blades &gt; polearm/swords &gt; hammer &gt; axe
---
Dont use the general, trade or lfg to find groups or whats the point of a guild. All the addon does is scrape chat channels my dude

---
Cos it isn't dungeon finder. Its baaically just filtering the spam from trade chat.
---
They aren’t but they haven’t allowed that shit for a long time. That add on basically played the game for you.
---
Steal half the video, and have an "please activate windows" message show during a good portion of the video.... classy.
---
https://youtu.be/Z0sq3T5fErQ
---
I'm not talking about group finder where you press the button, it queues you then teleports you to the instance and away you go ala dungeon finder/lfr. I'm talking about the premade group finder, where you list the group for the instance you are making, say a raid pug, then people apply to the group, you can ask them for things like prior experience, and invite them if you like them. Then you still have to make your way to the instance at some point. Literally just cuts out the mind numbing LFM spam in trade.
---
Seems simple enough for me to understand, not everyone is interested in every aspect of Vanilla.
---
I’m playing Classic to quest through pre-Cataclysm Azeroth and see some of the old school server events like the opening of Ahn Qiraj, someone else might want to relive their glory days of classic raiding, and maybe someone has fond memories of those old PvP montages.
---
None of these things specifically require that “vanilla feel” as a whole so long as the aspect that player is looking for is there. You can add on a modern interface and quality of life improvements and still relive the glory of killing Ragnaros, or enjoy the old RPG game systems and class design in PvP.
---
Beyond all that, I think a lot of people aren’t all that bothered about having a “pure” or “authentic” experience as much as they’re looking for something close enough, something that makes concessions in areas they don’t mind while letting them experience what they either remember fondly or missed out on and want to see for themselves.
---
&gt;By doing so, Blizzard has inadvertantly announced that the Scarab Lord mount (very limited time, for a select few) won’t be making a return to classic. Also, ZG mounts, because not all players may get this drop before server end, will also not be returning
---
Wrong. 
---
Don't spread lies.
---
Yeah, nice try
---
Jesus Christ I hope you're not being serious
---
I did not but didn’t private servers have way more people on them than Vanilla servers did and more than classic will? That issue might not be as bad in classic
---
I for one am looking forward to spamming chat with LFM :) 
---
Even tho chat is spammed with people looking for members for things, it’s all part of the experience. I’d hate to have a LFG addon and for people to just use it and never speak a word to each other the whole dungeon :/ 
---
Shit sucks.

Why would an undead need to train guns? They can not be hunters in classic
---
An addon that more or less just reads/posts in the LFG thing isn't damaging. The instant queue crossrealm grouping is the thing that harmed WoW.   
---
Using an addon that tells me a group is looking for X doesn't hurt. It prevents people from having to spam LF1M in chat over and over. You still have to group and run there with people that play on your server and faction. So meh
---
Obviously you need to go troll priest

Do mouseover macros work on selected targets if you don't have someone under you mouse?  Also, do mouseover macros work on raid frames?

unpopular opinion: LFG addons arent really a big deal since your going to be playing with people from your server regardless.  TSM is much more damaging than any LFG addon.
---
Premades for pvp, raids, friends, it is very possible to combine both guildies and the addon

That's odd... in your post history you are a staunch supporter of Classic+, which means you're against #nochanges, which means you *should* be perfectly fine with Blizzard disabling addons like this... which is it?
---
I'm still trying to figure out wtf i want to play... I keep foreseeing the negatives of playing a class instead of the positive lmao  
---
what i want out of a class is unique pvp, relatively decent farming(i'm a gold fiend)
---
I've mained sham for years but I know it's going to be hard to get into raids as dps(ele).  
---
Second main = hunter, It fits what i want to do, but i know it falls off throughout the phases.  
---
Mage = fits profile well, but has high supply, everyone wants to be a mage.  
---
i've contemplated lock recently just because it's my least played character ever.
---
Same way the lake of skeleton hurts the game. It takes away a little bit more of the immersion that the community treasures so much.

Everyone goes to bed around 8pm, and my wife gets up for work most mornings at 4:30am, so she goes to bed early too.  I figure PST server is my best bet, unless I can find a "Dad Guild" that raids late-late evenings.  Which, given what a lot of people have said, might be more likely than I first anticipated.
---
&gt; Enter Wrath of the Lich King and the LFG tool. This let people find groups from outside their server. So people were free to be [toxic](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/559/greaterintfuckwad.jpg) again. 
---
This exactly. It wasn't the LFG tool that ruined everything it was not being held accountable for your actions since you'll never play with them again.
---
Okay, you have fun im fortnite season 57!
---
Microwave food. Order out for Pizza.. Coffee if he is doing the leveling marathon..

Old school Runescape back in the day was my only MMO basically
---
Yes estrogen is good for you
---
Just graduate.
---
Hah. WoW nearly prevented that for many people :)
---
I don't know how good our educational system is.
---
The primary issues are the warrior toolkit while leveling isn't very conducive to quick questing/grinding.
---
No Victory rush or any real reliable self healing.
---
Mortal strike//Bloodthirst are level 40 (31 point) talents...
---
So you're pretty much limited to charge-&gt;Rend and use rage on heroic strike unless overpower procs.
---
Then, you have to eat after every pull or 2 (of 1 mob each time)...
---
--------------
---
Now, it should be noted that.. Once you hit 40, the speed at which you kill things gets significantly faster.. AND if you level with any even partially offspec healer (or hunter pet which can hold aggro from you for a few hits to spread the dmg), everything gets MUCH easier...
---
But if you are just straight comparing warrior solo vs other classes solo... Yes, warrior is basically tied for last with solo paladin.
---
Hmm figured it could be different, hopefully not too much.
---
You're giving me a hard cringe my dude. Yikes from me dawg.
---
i think that's a lot up to the lighting being different in game, but yeah there's slight differences :)

---
What is an elite membership?
---
Very hard to compare to a lot of things. Warrior is mostly a single pull class so grinding is going to be a bit more tedious then other classes. Then there is the issue of needing to constantly regain health via bandages or food. If you level with a buddy who is a healer it will be a much more enjoyable experience.
---
One thing I recommend as warrior is to get used to tanking if you want to level up faster. Since you are the tank you can make special requests like LFG with all shareable quests. While not every group does this... being a tank certainly has it's benefits when picking from the litter.
---
&gt;  If I have school on launch day does that mean I'll be missing out on a lot of opportunities?
---
No, 80+% of the other players will be just like you. The game will be active and buzzing from 1-60 for months to come, so don't worry at all about being left behind.
---
Duuude Atiesh is so zeppelin
---
While I agree that you're a bitch if you use this, I believe in the modularity of add-ons and the emergent gameplay that comes with it
---
If people want to ruin vanilla, whatever, fuck it
---
Its just slow man, also just puked when i looked up what OSRS was
---
It's the only class that has to legitimately worry about dying if you pull more than one mob.  No defensive CDs, no CC (lol fear just brings more), no way to heal, no way to escape.
---
This is another paid addon.
---
But people die if they are killed!

Literally was only able to do it because it was during my last semester of college. All I had to do was write my thesis, and take a single class 2x a week for 2 hours.  I was glued to my computer otherwise.
---
You have no clue what your talking about kid.
---
In phase 2 the server cap will be the same as in vanilla, stop spreading bullshit if you are clueless
---
I actually wouldn't wish anything was more like runescape ever.
---
Classic servers are probably on par if not even bigger than most popular vanilla servers. It's comparable to the chat of any big Twitch streamer.
---
One bid of main spec then free roll if no one bids. Not wanting to complicate 20 mans since we're not really giving dkp for going. We were talking about just free rolling all 20 mans but there is some BIS gear from there so we want main spec an opportunity to get it.

Of course it is. Expect twinking starting in P3 in the 19, 29, and 39 brackets. No one has or will ever care about 49.

I just wish she was old enough to play :)
---
....wait, I take that back...I don't wish this on anyone :)
---
But ppl like me who don’t have friends will just never have groups then
---
Finally, some good fucking content
---
It's actually hearth Glen for me as a horde player. I spent so many hours farming elites with my friend there and pvping. It's a pretty long run back so the pvp was pretty intense. That or the entrance to wsg in the barrens.

[*Welcome to Circuit City, Where Service is State of the Art!*](https://gfycat.com/sociableelderlygallowaycow)
---
I worked there for a year or so, it was insanity, and fun. I'd never do it again.
---
Well let's be honest here.  If you remove the ilvl from all these whispers, you know you're taking the Priest Healer, you need one of those.  The warrior tank, cause lol Paladin tank is lol, and you need one of those.  The 60 hunter because they're fucking level 60.  And, then the other highest level dps that brings something you need to the group warrior/priest/hunter/you don't bring.
---
So in other words, that addon adds ilvl to let me know that hunter is gonna depend on their pet and be a shitter with his 32 ilvl.
---
This.  This cock blocked so many people - having a dps on that could use that tank gear in a dungeon almost always ment the tank found a way to shake them before we got too far in.  So bad.
---
You can level as a damage spec and you should still be able to heal dungeons fine, especially as a priest (if thats what youre picking)
---
Ah yeah we gold sellers now boys!
---
Yeah but joining a ml 5man isn't a thing. What a bad idea.
---
I'd much rather an LFG add-on becomes the go to place to find groups than server discords. Optimally /lfg would be a default channel that everyone joined automatically (in a separate tab), but since it's not we're already in a spot where grouping sources will be split all over the place. If any of the options could become so dominant it became pretty much mandatory that would be a overall plus in my book, and an add-on is probably the most likely candidate to successfully get there.
---
Missing welcome to the jungle by guns and roses
---
The nostalgia definitely has me sticking to the same faction. A different experience is a good reason to go Horde too. Which has more sway is subjective to each individual.
---
One more variable that may help you choose is: Do you hope to play with or bump into old friends or guildmates? If so, the server and faction the majority of them have chosen would be a good option. And vice-versa if you'd rather meet and play with new friends.
---
Go tank, they take at least as long if not longer to find than healers. You can always dps as a warrior as well.
---
This place is literally a nightmare on pvp servers.

---
is it? i thought blu (up, muppet, uggboot) - mo (no, moped, go)
---
This was done in retail off and on, and it did stop twinking because, and this should surprise no one, twinks don't really like fighting other twinks. 
---
That said, I doubt they'd do it in Classic. Twinking was a big part of the classic experience after all.
---

---
As long as they leave some vanilla ones and don't put sprinkles on all of them, I don't mind.  Just like when they release the TBC servers, I'm sure they will leave Classic ones.  There's no reason not to.  People will still play it and sub.  All you care about is the sub, so why not leave some running?
---
If people who asked for vanilla want to bring in quality of life from every expansion after, this is proof that players are craving the social aspect and gearing from vanilla. 
---
The game now lacks the social enjoyment from vanilla by phasing population and blending a large server group together, something that Classic addresses by allowing realm identity to flourish without phasing.
---
The game now also lacks the gearing aspect of vanilla in favor of slot machine stats and poor class design. The vanilla classes weren't perfect, but certain classes did well in separate types of content and some could do extremely well in all types of content in the hands of an excellent player. In Bfa, you have little choice and you are made to be equal with everyone else.

I didn't realize this was coming out when i booked my vacation! I'll be overseas. 
---
If i had known i would've just took the week off and stayed home to play WOW
---
Looking great! 
---
However I believe there is a mistake with the Glowing Shard quest in WC. Your website lists it as Horde only but both ClassicDB, Wowhead and my private server experience show it as doable for both factions.

Even though i know I wont play retail anymore, theres just too many memories tied to that character, I could never delete him.
---
PvP didn’t award xp back then. Battlegrounds gave tokens, 1 for a loss 3 for a win. You turn in 3 for a fat chunk of experience.
---
let me guess - you're a toxic dick?  seems like it
---
Really the only manditory race / class combo is Dwarf Priest for alliance, only dwarf priests get the skill “fear ward” which prevents a target “tank” from getting feared/ if you are not playing a alliance priest race / class combo is not important play what you want.
---
In my opinion being in a proper guild gives a nice sense of being a part of some small community, the possibilities of making long-term friends and to make the game more fun to play. You log in and there will be people you can play with, people you know and who you've spoken to. All packed neatly into a micro community. 
---
If you put the effort into a proper guild (not the ones who spam invite you just to have people in one) But a real guild who do weekly raids, who group up to pvp or do dungeons. For me it enhances the experience way more than to log on and wonder if I should bother doing a dungeon because it will be with some random people I have no connection with. 
---
You could argue that you can make friends with any random people but a guild promotes, as I said. A small micro community where multiple people will end up knowing eachother in some way to hopefully create something special.
---
Why the hell were you downvoted?
---
I'll use whatever addons I damn well please.
---
Ion said "just don't use it" isn't good enough because the addon becomes part of the fabric. Yet you still see idiots going "just don't use it!!"
---
Considering how few realms they've actually had to add over the last two weeks, I think huge is overselling it a bit.
---
&gt; How can you say it's not automatic matchmaking and then proceed to say "only 'automatic' for the group leader."
---
Matchmaking implies that several people have done the same thing and just get grouped automagically, auto-invite(which nobody should use) is only used by one person and sends an invite based on keywords sent in chat.
---
A real computer but it can only do half what other computers can do?
---
Ahhh right I remember now! Good stuff. Thanks.
---
IMO the group finder aspect isn’t the main problem. It’s the auto porting to dungeons. If people wanna spam a discord for groups instead of trade chat I don’t see a problem with that.
---
Personally don't care if it exists, and I don't think it's going to ruin the community. I don't think the LFG tool destroyed communities either. Community is developed and maintained by encountering the same people repeatedly over time. It makes very little difference how or why those encounters happen.
---
There are 2 primary ways retail ended communities - cross server grouping which significantly reduced the chances of seeing the same players more than once (almost impossible at this point) and reducing the difficulty of the dungeons/raids so much that it did not matter who or what joined the group. Ironically the in game LFD tool was only successful because of both those changes, and then they also added the massive convenience of instant teleportation to the dungeon.
---
In Classic those 3 changes won't exist. The pool of players you can group with is only a few thousand, not 100s of thousands. You will, at some point, run into the same players again and this is foundation of developing a community. Auto invites and addon assisted group building will not affect this. Classic dungeons are not mindless like normal/heroic dungeons in retail. You will have failures and you will make internal notes of people you find successes and failures with (if not externally with blacklists in your auto invite tool, blocking, or adding friends).
---
I have yet to see anything from this addon that is detrimental to community building. It's really just not a big deal. Maybe you can enlighten me to something specific that I'm overlooking but as of now it's just such a non issue to me.
---
Silence
---
The cons are easy replacements and lack of bonding versus the amount of pros? Idc much. But seems if it’s not invasive and is server wide and only works for fellow addon users it wouldn’t hurt as much. 
---
Than again if they get in the sticky territory of mob think and ban an addon the community hates. That’s dangerous territory. 
---
The nochanges fad was weird to understand anyways in situations on class balance for me I believe still that they should’ve made classes on par or at elast competitive while maintaining content difficulty. Along with professions. 
---
We’re gonna see an abundance of class priority and professions that aren’t gonna be the classic experience anyways. Both issues that would make a meaningful experience and a in my opinion a needed change. 
---
But I enjoy the novelty and happy with both before I get shilled into downvoted.
---
Wait, your "fuck off" to a post that says that don't want that idea made me think that you wanted the osrs votation
---
You never played Vanilla, didn’t you?
---
Yeah like with all due respect dude. You also made a dumb and annoying comment on my post... You don't know.. So stfu and listen to the people who do.
---
Racial bonuses are only barely significant for those trying to min/max the game at the highest levels. And even then, things such as your computer monitor, lag, a few seconds of being out of range, or straight dumb luck with crits and misses on attacks are likely to have a much bigger impact than racial bonuses. 
---
They are not significant enough for you to worry about min/max your character or for you to be worrying about if you picked the "wrong" race. 
---
Just pick what you think sounds the coolest, looks the coolest, or has the most interesting racials to you. There isn't a wrong answer.
---
I've been asking myself the same question. Personally I'm rolling horde. Might as well see the areas I've never seen! If im so into classic at 60 that I want to roll alliance on another server I can
---
How is spamming "LF tank" for an hour in trade chat anymore immersive than using an addon that lets you look for tanks?
---
It's not gonna be the same as LFG is now. Now if someone drops out, someone comes and spawns where the group is so there is very little interruption. In Classic you would need to run out of the instance and summon the replacement and then make it all the way back which might mean respawns. People are making too much out of nothing.
---
Season 18 over the weekend. Something to whet the appetite before classic.
---
And then be that tank that rolls on Healy gear and gets blacklisted so much that your guild boots you to keep the negativity at bay.
---
I find it hilarious that of course its the tauren that said Bullshit. Great work.
---
Darkshore is just so depressing in retail, really makes me sad
---
Stat sticks
---
I've read this three times and I still don't know what the fuck you just typed.
---
I would go prot at 40 once we get shield bash so solo questing is not unbearable. But if I stay arms I get MS...
---
I think that if C+ happened we would have another fight for classic servers a few years later, except we wouldn't have a leg to stand on.
---
Watch out, Tom Cruise might have to go Mission Impossible on you if you keep that up.

[This isn't the exact scenario described, but it's the best I could do!](https://clips.twitch.tv/CrazyModernMouseDatSheffy)
---
I mean I kinda enjoyed my twinked lvl 19 shaman during wotlk even if I had to fight other twinks.  It was a good way to play a character without actually investing that much effort.  But yeah its a little less fun playing other twinks than it is when you get to 2 shot normies left and right.
---
Or just be a warrior tank and res whatever you want
---
Spot on, at least an LFG add on takes place only on the game. Discord isn't exactly true to the classic experience so it's all very contradictory. The premade group finder exists on retail today because everyone just used 3rd party sites like openraid to group up in MoP.
---
I say go for the horde and let them play alliance! On the same server you will still interact and see each other but in a new fun aspect. I have buddies playing horde on my server that I am alliance and it is making me more competitive then ever!
---
Depends what you mean by fine experience.   Racial can provide very powerful benefits but its not going to make or break your character in pve.  In pvp it kinda can
---
They will gear it and keep it parked. Phase 2 will open and they will steamroll the 19 bracket. It's why I said the END of phase 1.
---
Way higher quality content than I expected
---
My thoughts exactly, I wouldn't wanna switch right when MS is in my grasp
---
Still don’t see what the problem is 
---
As long as it not cross server it won’t effect the “server community”
---
Lol, you says this about the addon LITERALLY NAMED "Classic LFD". 
---
Okay then, if you somehow truly believe Ion was talking about something else (which makes no sense when you think about it. Ask yourself to describe what you THINK Ion meant and see if you can find an answer. The man literally said "saying just dont use it if you dont want it isn't good enough" to help you understand and you still managed to miss it), then surely you have nothing to be worried about right.
---
So just sit back and chill, we will report this to Blizzard, along with community outcry, and surely Ion and the dev team will come back and say this isn't what they meant, and welcome an Addon that literally names itself after LFD while mimicking as much of its functionality as the API allows. Im sure they can't wait to tell us this is A-Okay.
---
...How? Just bring some meat and feed the poor thing.
---
Too bad its a Normal Pacific server, and Herod is PVP Eastern...
---
Well they may be all that, but they get up in November and go vote Red.  Just saying.
---
Like others have said,  yeah you can do this,  the main issue you might have is finding a class trainer if you roll a class that they can't be.
---
Nope, you nailed it. The whole post is a non sequitur.
---
I think it really depends on the class/race you played, and how important that is to you today.  I love Paladins.  I rolled horde Paladins once TBC came out. But if you have friends rolling horde, try it out. 
---
Ultimately, I killed the Lich King with my gnome warlock.  Will never replace that feeling...and so I'm sticking with Alliance for my mains.
---
But definitely see the fun in both.
---
No the reality is a Night Elf
---
Ya, compare a $400 laptop to a $2000 mackbook pro and one of them will last longer. Buy a Macbook air and see what happens when it breaks. You throw it in the garbage.
---
I’ve been posting this same argument for over a decade and have never been voted positively. Seeing this +100 is true beauty to my eyes. Shame I’m so damn old at this point and don’t have the same interest in the game anymore.
---
All the PVP East names are trash other than Herod, no wonder nobody is leaving.
---
If group finder addons become popular I fear Jay Allen Brack will push to add it to classic so he can say "I told you so."
---
There are a few not so obvious things
---
eg; 
---
Orc hunters - the 'Berserking' buff only buffs MELEE attack power.. Whereas Troll gets a haste buff and +Bow skill (very nice for itemization issues with +hit later on)
---
Dwarf priest has been mentioned...
---
Human 'sword' racial is also VERY good for any class intending to use melee weapons. (eg; Rogues who intend to do pve should not roll gnomes who get dagger bonuses... because the dagger talent build is terrible for pve)
---
But truly.. if you aren't intending on endgame content and just want to enjoy the ride... then pick any race and class combination you want (that the game lets you)
---
Subtle yet nerdy, good choice.
---
I want people to stop complaining so much.  Do you understand that in 90~ hours you'll be playing the game?
---
this
---
I third this motion
---
Ordered a 12 pack yesterday.
---
FREAKING BAWLS.
---
How freaking nostalgic...
---
Pretty sure queuing for dungeons and raids is the most disliked feature.
---
Just because you do easy content that doesn't require communication doesn't mean groups using group finder to do mythic+ don't communicate.
---
I joined a Mythic guild after meeting people using the group finder.
---
Do I need to explain why making a discussion post about an idea you don't like is dumb?
---
bullshit everyone knows the legend of whamen is a fictional concept and only a myth
---
mate wouldn’t the lack of job dilemma point you in the opposite direction of going hard?
---
Do you think that Blizzard is unaware that the API they created doesn't allow porting? Do you realize how stupid this line of reasoning it? They know you cant port with an addon... Blizzard knows that.... How could they NOT know that.
---
Why would you think an addon has to do something impossible to cross the line that Ion references here: https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv/clip/ThirstyIronicAsparagusDuDudu
---
Read between the lines here. Good tanks find friends as they do dungeons/pvp/quests.  They then make guilds, because they can, and really good ones become well known enough to gobble up lesser guilds .
---
Gearing is so odd in Classic that gearscore addons can't really happen. Someone would have to weigh certain items and ignore their ilvl, and if theres multiple addons then items will have different weights per addon. It's extremely unlikely that it would be made and properly adopted by people. A [raider.io](https://raider.io) addon, though, showing clears in dungeons and raids may happen.
---
This is correct
---
While this is probably true, the ease of access of an addon compared to that of a website is enough to make it so most people dont even bother with it. Even more when the target of the addon is lazy people
---
For the same reason Westfall is in the EASTern Kingdoms.
---
Bro... I sold service warranties on tape recorders. 7.99 extra and it’ll never break!
---
That dwarf priest stuff is bullshit too. Sure it's a nice feature to bring to a raid, but horde does fine without it. And priests are always in demand
---
I feel like I should know why they'd do that
---
This has to be the best post on this subreddit.
---
would be better to Meshuggah
---
\#nochanges my dude. Inspecting talents is balls.

People refuse to realize that something like this already existed in Classic, AND without something like this there's no way Classic makes it a whole year
---
yeah, its you. you're completely out of touch with how the game is actually played today.
---
/who tank
---
Discord is a much more powerful tool than IRC, there's already channels on these realm discords for grouping and the game isn't out yet ffs, it's not 2004 any more, this is how it is now
---
It wasn't
---
This issue is a time where Reddits tendency to latch onto issues and never let them go can be put to good use. You can see the minority of people trickling into these discussion going "But itll be a little bit easier than reading chat, whats so wrong with that?" And the rest of us KNOW that this entire mentality is what drove the game to retail.
---
I truly believe these are the tourists arriving. Most likely they will leave the game anyway in the first 3 months when they realize using an Addon isn't working and they have to actually socialize.
---
#NODUNGEONFINDERFORCLASSIC
---
&gt; I'm no expert, but the biggest difference is spell batching delay. In retail it's 5-15ms, vanilla/classic 400ms.
---
**Retail** has a grace period ("lag tolerance", or rather SpellQueueWindow) set by default at **400ms**. It's not exactly like spell batching but that's quite a bit of input lag if you have low latency natively (fast connexion, fast display, fast fingers).
---
I divorced my wife back in February, built a new computer in May, I am ready.
---
Ppl talk about interaction, but alot of ppl forgeting its 2k19 and ppl this days act different then it was back then 15 years ago.
---
Ashenvale fills the gap if you want to eventually have that feel of Teldrassil.
---
I don't mind but I'd prefer it they didn't change the game that dramatically.
---
You clearly don't understand that Classic and Retail are both built on the same back ends. Both use the exact same spam detection tools.
---
Great looks like everyone's forced to play horde now :".
---
Dont let yourself play until you send out several resumes and check your email every day. 
---
I'm serious. Your future is more important than any game.
---
PSA Mages are better off selling it if the price is right for mount or stock up for tailoring
---
Gave me a good laugh. Have a gold.
---
Sexy af
---
&gt; is it even worth looking for a guild as a new/newish player ? 
---
As much of a non-answer it is, just go with what you want.
---
It's not gonna make much of a difference to have a guild ahead of time or join one after launch unless you're gonna try to race to 60.
---
You'll still be able to get into dungeons and find people for group quests if you're not in a guild, that's also a nice way to meet people that you might 'click' with.
---
&gt; How do you feel from the small amount of new players that do manage to hit 60 should approach this situation ?
---
Raids are very simple in classic, mechanics-wise.        
---
Hunters do have some responsibility in raids but it's not hard since there's usually a couple of hunters in the raid.        
---
Unless you join a guild that's striving to be one of the top guilds on the server, and you're willing to learn, most guild will probably invite you to raids even if you don't have experience.
---
And a good attitude helps with both of those things :)
---
Lol I think that's actually a spongebob reference
---
Looks like Horde are going to have a pop advantage on PvP servers, so if you plan to play on one of those, know that the Alliance needs you.
---
It doesn't matter as much if you're on PvE.
---
lol there were a ton of servers in vanilla, your experience is not necessarily the experience
---
LFG addons were not used extensively on my server in vanilla
---
That's honestly probably better for your health long term.
---
But... why? At least for the Alliance, Onyxia did some truly heinous things as Lady KP. The entire hellish attunement based around Jailbreak explains pretty in-depth.
---
Oh man, I would love a singleplayer FFXI, have some AI adventurers to party up with.
---
People are totally missing the point.  
---
It isn't dungeon group finder which ruined WoW.  
---
It was Cross-Realm and the auto spawn in the dungeon.
---
The amount of 'slippery slope' bullshit I see in this sub already makes me want to unsub from here TBH. 
---
Ignoring the fact that these tools were available 15 years ago so the point is moot anyway, these are the EXACT same arguments that were had when OSRS launched.
---
"MUH SOCIAL INTERACTION VIA TRADING - DON'T IMPLEMENT GRAND EXCHANGE."
---
It's bullshit in OSRS, and it's bullshit here. There is no fucking meaningful social interaction to be had while forming a group, just like there was no meaningful social interaction had while trading in OSRS. 
---
Here's how it plays out when you're trying to get pugs:
---
"LFG wailing caverns" - player 1
---
"inv" - player 2
---
shift+click - player 1 - either invite or don't invite depending on level and class. Maybe you ask if they're a healer if you need one. Done. 
---
The actual social interaction starts happening when the group is formed and you're in the fucking instance for the next 2 hours together. Speeding up getting to that point changes nothing. It's just purists being purists and I fucking hate it already.
---
i wanna grind a hunter on classic so bad. Who knows maybe an epic or a cool set of patterns could drop. You never know.
---
There was an addon that did this during Vanilla and Blizzard copied it for TBC. So yeah, this is literally not a change from Vanilla.
---
People just love being angry.
---
Word. IMO the only somewhat mandatory one is DBM, if you don't know that particular boss, and only because there are many other people involved whose time is all wasted if someone Leeroy's the whole room down on top of them. 
---
But yeah for everything else you really don't need anything per se.
---
Maybe easiest if you spam dungeons. I dont  think so about questing or mob grinding.
---
dont try to compare poe trading to grouping up in WoW, not even remotely similar
---
&gt;LFG makes everyone else pretty dispensable. If someone sucks, fuck 'em, take a quick break while you replace queue them.
---
Thats not how this works, "fuck em" and booting them even with this addon is basically adding 30-40 minutes onto your run even if you find a replacement immidiately.
---
This isn't retail where people instant teleport to dungeons and there are thousands of players across 100s of realms to choose from. Nobody is going to say "hey this run is going to take 10 minutes longer with this bad dps, better kick them and wait 10 minutes for someone to apply and another 30 minutes for them to get where we are on the map".
---
The people fearing this addon and using this argument as the boogieman really make me think they are just the epitome of absolute dogshit at this game and are afraid at the idea that their abysmal performance will be so detrimental to a groups progress that they would rather boot them and wait upwards of 40 minutes than deal with them.
---
And thats just fucking hilarious.
---
Bout tree fiddy
---
YES! The Blood Necklaces or something like that. I completed everything super quick, but the necklaces took at least a whole level of grinding!
---
Serve the king. The barbarians must be slain.
---
Seriously though, level alliance behind their honorless backs.
---
Its not really that bad. I leveled one in classic and didn't even notice a difference. You just are at a big disadvantage if you don't run dungeons every few levels
---
This just gives people more time to set up their twinks though. I personally don't mind because this is the true classic experience after all.
---
I remember BGs sub 60 and there was a mix of twinks and non twinks. Me and my friends made 19 twinks and it was just too fun.
---
I can understand why some people don't like it, but this is classic and classic had twinks.
---
How much of this is just a stigma/meme from the original classic? Are we expecting the same thing to happen?
---
I agree minus the cross-realm aspect of it. It's going to happen anyway with server discords, why not cut the middle man and just have it in-game?
---
I don't understand why people are so pissed. There was an add-on just like this in vanilla wow that worked similar to what they have now...
---
It was my understanding that layering would not have an effect on login queues, and it would only have an effect in-game? Or did I get it wrong?
---
I think he was actually referring to [this reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuJNUXT2a9U) from spongebob.
---
The B99 clip is gold though.
---
stay the fuck in retail if you want this LFG addon. stop trying to ruin classic.

Im playing just like I did in vanilla.  No addons.  Lots of googling/thottbot.

Good luck reading anything with 5k people posting in the LFG channel.

I’m... what is this?

Use the flight paths for quick bathroom / food breaks
---
Well herod is expected to see queues of 10k+ 
---
Meaning the server is gonna have ~20k on a lowball guess so..
---
Nobody should use this.  Not even them.
---
You made it sound like thanks to Activision buying them out, they couldn't complete some ideas in Vanilla, aka Activision bought them out beginning of TBC instead of Wrath.
---
Bigglesworth is gonna kill that server.
---
pls remove
---
pretty bogus
---
Helpme is a perfect reason why everyone should respect this addon.
---
Shouldn't be that bad, depends where you are. Anywhere from 40 to 100, I'd take a guess of 80 since that's what I get.
---
just chain mind control+sap+polymorph and walk them from quest hub to quest hub.
---
People with similiar thinking created raider.io btw
---
Character name actually has some bearing on your experience. Server name truly means absolutely fuck all.

Hell yeah it is, it's so cool.
---
And it gives me an excuse to tank because it's fun despite having no clue about most of the layouts!
---
Well, I wouldn't want a feature in Classic that wasn't in Vanilla, anyway. That would make in *not* classic.
---
These types of addons were in vanilla.  Call to Arms was in vanilla along with a LFG addon.  Things just didnt get popular, but you can bet your ass that these will be come launch.

This.

I use addons galore, but i respect everyones choice in what way they wish to play the game.

Omg the nostalgia!

I’m not sure if you are a troll or just as your username says. Vanilla was 20x more social than current retail wow.

How fucking deer you liken us to filthy, lowly vegans, we'll see how vegan I am once I'm devouring your corpse.

If you do that none of the players new to Classic will get the true Classic WoW experience in the crucial early days when they’re deciding whether to carry on playing or not.

True. Classic wow isn't leaving any time soon but job opportunities come and go. Keep the job hunt going and enjoy your time off the search with WoW!
---
Yes. Join us.
---
Yeah and thereby diminish the value of Social connections like joey tried to point out. If you want a more centralized grouping process.. join a guild or make Friends somewhere. Be part of a community. LFG doesn't fit Classic, it's supposed to be hard finding a group. Forcing you to either go to the zone or capital and thereby making it part of your journey and/or Social experiance. It's not intended to be convenient. If you are nicd anx trustworthy, you will add eachother and go toghetter for maybe another go later on, because of this inconvenience.
---
That specific server contains my early childhood.
---
* Guilds : You can probably check  their discords if you use that to see what type of guild they are and how social they are ahead of time. However it doesn't matter if you join now or later, because your going to be spending some serious time leveling. Can a guild help with leveling? Absolutely, but it's always a hit or miss. Sometimes you spend more time guild hopping then actually leveling.
---
* PVP : It depends on the level of criticism you're willing to accept. If it's a lot then join a PVP guild. Get reamed for a little while when not knowing the class to it's potential. Eventually you'll get good, because most of your mistakes have been scolded out of you.
---
* Raiding : Find a guild. Seriously. This is the one time I will say find a guild if you want to achieve this. Do you need to do it right away? No. You can wait till 60, but if you ever want to then a guild is your only safe bet.
---
I honestly can't wait to style on Horde
---
Not even joking, I intend to run a warrior in Classic pretty much solely because I remember how highly in-demand they were in Vanilla. I don't want to stand around trade chat spamming "LF Tank Scholo then G2G, pst" again

Just avoid Winterspring all together if you can.

Not even close.

The Call to Arms addon in vanilla didn't require other people to have the addon. It looked at the regular chat channels you were in, compiled all the LFG/LFM messages it saw, and displayed them to you in one filterable UI alongside any addon channel LFG/LFM messages from other people with CTA. It also could advertise your LFG/LFM status in regular chat channels so people without the addon could join.
---
*If* this LFG addon is not including regular LFG/LFM messages in its pool, that's pretty foolish- it's excluding a large portion of the player base, and making looking for groups *slower*.

And what happens when you don't get a group in the first 10 min? The first 30? 45 min later, are you still only posting in general/trade asking openly?  The point is these addons hamper people's social experience with the game. You can get a group 100x faster by asking people directly if they want to join you for your dungeon/quest/mob/etc. but if you're relying on an addon/feature to do it for you and it fails, is that the end of the road for you and you stop bothering?
---
Your account is embarrassing.
---
This is funny because it’s true.
---
It's not just a bulletin for LFG which I would be fine with. It allows people with the addon to inspect your talent tree and also has auto-invite feature. The dev will probably add gearscore/ ilvl check when his donators request it. This has the potential to become the raider.io for Classic, which I am sure you're fine with.
---
Uhh, invading someone else’s territory and destroying their landmarks for financial gain isn’t exactly kosher. It’s all vidya game stuff anyway and there’s plenty of horde badness too, but...
---
Is a fury ✔
---
Has a child avatar ✔
---
Is Horde ✔
---
Deja Vu. How long until Blammo is full too?
---
Yes, exactly, this is the issue.
---
It effectively separates people looking for a group into people that have it, and people who don't. These two pools of players will never interact in finding groups.
---
And if too many people start to use it, it really negatively effects people looking for groups the old fashion way in game. Blizzard in the past would probably incorporate this add on into the main game if enough people were using it, or talk about banning it. But that isn't an option in Classic. They have to make the game the way it was.
---
Especially on an alt! “Just 2 more cloths away from 60!”
---
How are you liking the mic? Still debating on which one to upgrade too.
---
for sure one of my biggest issues ya.
---
tbh I really love the mounts, titles, toys, and all the different BGs. The BG with the carts, the orbs, and then the other CTF map are all insane and fun. Epic BGs are horrible tho lol
---
And my pet!
---
If you want a balanced faction wait for the new servers on launch day.
---
What's the black circle connected to the front of your Yeti Pro?
---
 Did you? The addon doesn't recreate functionalities removed from Classic nor create a social network. How exactly it's related?
---
As an altoholic, I'm really happy at this news!
---
I saw a thread where some tried to do a survey to know the faction distribution and language spoke but I would trust those stats. I think it's fair to assume there will be a bit more horde in each server so you shouldn't rlly have to take that into account Imo.
---
I plan on choosing the server on release based on queu lengths.
---
Arise my .. champion???
---
I think he meant the object not the size of the tat 🤣
---
The real reason for the Paladin hate! Shame on you warriors!
---
Don't worry bud, they're gonna change the details on their planned press release after its already been sent out just because it's too darn inconvenient for people. I'm sure of it.
---
some of us adults have night jobs so latency is a huge consideration since our schedule places us so far out of prime time. Not everyone plays on their own coast or even the same region, I was considering oceanic for a while.
---
The reason I wore my gloves at work today.
---
I don't think it'll be a big deal. For it to work at all it'd need a lot of people to use it and I just don't see that happening.
---
Stick to fucking retail
---
Did you not read the part where I put I was aware It wasn't in vanilla? If you wanna be condescending maybe make it relevant.
---
Do you get this shitter shattered over discord LFG? 
---
If you wanna pretend that people didn't demand specific builds in vanilla then maybe it was you who didn't play.
---
I mean troll is really really good in pve but the orc stun resist is just sooo juicy
---
Shadow spec is one of the best leveling specs. It's so smooth and fast with hardly any down time.
---
Going Dwarf this time, but first character in Vanilla was Nelf warrior. Loved playing defence in battlegrounds for this reason.
---
Because at some point before phase 2 they want to boil it down to 1 layer. It is easy for them to allow multitude of layers, but if they want to remove layering in the future they can’t have servers with 10k or more concurrent players, hence the queue.
---
perhaps they should just create a containment server for people that hate addons
---
That's why I stopped being atheist
---
Yikes. You just keep getting more ignorant. The only effect isn't "now I gotta right click". The effect of transmog is that you lose an important part of the community feel when you allow that. There is no longer noobs walking around in awe of the awesome looking raid set someone has. It takes away from the accomplishment and the feeling of finally getting those nice pieces of gear that you're happy to show off. That reward for something that you really had to work for was what made vanilla wow such a great game for a lot of people. 
---
When you put transmog in the game and everyone looks awesome, really no one looks awesome. It all just blurs together and you stop caring very quickly about other ppls gear and in turn your own gear that you would have been excited to show off previously.
---
You have to be completely brain dead to not understand that aspect of the game and it's importance and I have a little more faith in you than that. Even if you're still gonna send a poorly worded snarky reply after reading that you're clearly wrong think about this: If you think all the above points are not that big of a deal, then why do you think letting people pick what colour they wear is such a big deal?
---
I'm running healer, only group finding addon I'm gonna run is a blacklist
---
Haha nice
---
that's amazing was it actually on TV?
---

I hope your mom moves aswell.
---
Pop filter most likely.

I have been thinking this becouse tomorrow im going to ride my motorcycle on a racetrack. It wound be a shame to die 2 days before classic
---
I went with a simple black sabbath approach, but that cover is sick!

In Wrath I switched mains back to my warlock to take care of a guild need. Hadn't played much since BC. Was doing ICC when someone started asking why they allowed me in the raid with a BC offhand that I believe dropped in Sunwell. It was still the 4th best item when needing hit. 3rd wouldn't drop for me, and 1/2 dropped in ICC. Raid leader quickly informed them about shitty itemization.
---
Honestly worried it picks up too much noise even with the gamma all the way down, a mic cover (not in photo) and the other mic cover for my mouth (in photo) but the sound quality is amazing. Unfortunately I have a mechanical keyboard so it picks that up really well. Tbh I think it's a bit over powered for just gaming, maybe the smaller yeti that only faces 1 direction is better
---
Were you at least able tho reserve your names?
---
I need this. POGCHAMP F IN THE CHAT BOIZ PEPEGA WEIRDCHAMP in general chat will really piss on the old times for me. If you end up developing it, please hit me up.
---
Thanks! I had a lot of fun with that one.
---
I can’t disagree more, most of my friends are from LFG that turned into good dungeon buddies.
---
One, swingtimer.

''I'll use it and tell others about it.''

/same here
---
Can't speak for OP but I hardly every use reddit on my desktop.
---
If I remember correctly the bis weapon for 39 shamans is staff of Jordan, might be pricey tho :p
---
Yeah your right I understand that this might not have been big enough of a deal to make a post on it
---
Same mouse and keyboard, almost same bongs. Safe travels
---
That's just a given. I'll be disappointed otherwise.
---
Yeah I read your comment which basically says you don't know what you're talking about because you've never set foot in Vanilla or Classic. OH but you read comments. 
---
&gt;Do you get this shitter shattered over discord LFG? 
---
What does that even mean?
---
&gt;If you wanna pretend that people didn't demand specific builds in vanilla then maybe it was you who didn't play.
---
Yeah but guess what, nobody gives a fuck until 60. People heal in dps specs and vice versa. I bet you didn't know that either.
---
And imagine if you were a warlock too! Summons ! $$$$$$$$$$
---
I would love a movement to get people to use darnassus as main hub
---
Yeah, they were. I think someone did the math and they were around for like the last 25% of vanilla or something. I'm just curious if most people actually know they are launching as cross-realm(everyone I talked to did not) and also if people think that will kill the PVP community. In the end it probably won't even really be talked about much since the PVP community has generally always been pretty small. I don't think there were even any questions about BGs in the AMA recently.
---
NO LFG TOOL YOU FOOLS DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE ALLOW THIS!
---
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 1940'S!
---
according to the wiki you can do name (n), class (c), race (r), region (z), guild (g).
---
ie: `n-lis z-"Ironforge" r-"Human" c-"Priest" g-"Method" 30-40`
---
this is retail, but it's the best docs I can find quickly

---
it was.
---
lol was going to reply but that would be one less person in the queue
---
There is a lfg option ingame already. It's called the /who list. If we going to use this we might aswell use the gearscore addon to see who we want to take into our group. Or what about an addon to show what we achieved.
---
Every single week there is some make believe controversy on this subreddit.
---
Do you care more about playing with your coworkers/friends or the faction you like? It seems like a hard question, but you got to be truthful. For me, I hate horde and cannot imagine myself playing it, so even if my best friend rolled horde I would still go alliance. It just all depends on what you want to do.
---
I fucking love all these "you clearly didn't play vanilla" gatekeeping bullshit comments.
---
I raided naxx and even I couldn't tell you that you couldn't inspect talents in vanilla, we are talking 15 years ago and a function that has existed for I'd guess 13 years. Really isn't hard to see how people get shit wrong, but nope, if you don't know every detail in crystal clarity you've obviously never played.
---
This sub is demanding a community but acting like petulant children that no one would want to associate with lol, good luck with that
---
That "That Girl is Poison" dance tho. Nice.
---
They tried to warn us about the cow farts. We just didn’t listen.
---
Sweet pic
---
Females have the best model to display gear on. Everything on a male is too big
---
Lmao what? 49 pvp was the shit. I had an entire guild that just did 49 pvp in Vanilla. I tried them all and 49 was easily the most interesting and the one I did for the longest. 39 was the bad one my dude...not sure why you'd like being stuck 1 level away from mounts evening the movement speed playing ground or completed talent trees.
---
A meme from /r/2007scape
---
NOWAY JOSE
---
Go north when you cross the bridge to barrens, its those zhevras
---
This is the dumbest take - as if the prevailing group-forming methods won't affect people who "just don't use it."
---
The talent overhaul is enough by itself to make Mists my least favorite expansion, and that's ignoring other issues with the expansion.
---
Haha yes, aren’t you all grown up!
---
Can I just pay for the current wow and classic will be available to me?
---
For moral grey areas! FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
It also has to be funny. You can't just answer a joke seriously in an unfunny way and get mad when people think you're just stupid.
---
Right in the feels :')
---
which is the whole point of the classic experience.
---
Difference being neither of these games listed have chat channels and neither are true mmorogs (both have lobby like hubs where you cannot communicate to the whole online playerbase)
---
If people want these systems stick to retail.
---
It helps block air from your mouth getting into the microphone and distorting the audio. I put a whole mic cover on to help with wind
---
Good one
---
For non pvp videos im pretty sure big blue dress wins in my book
---
Pop filter exactly
---
Aw, im sad that one isnt EST (or CST, ideally) PvE :(
---
You over estimate queues and disconnects for sure. You'll see.
---
Any chance you could link a high res version of the skeram one to use?
---
r/me_irl
---
The difficulty to level is completely overshadowed by how genuinely op they are.  Warriors are the reason that vanilla is shit.
---
link leaks pls
---
Fair and reasonable response. I may well be wrong, but I prefer to err on the side of preserving the experience of Vanilla, because I’m not sure exactly what or what combination of things made the game magical.
---
This is literally WoW: Back in the Day.
---
Stop trying to relive your childhood by playing a 15 year old game and move on with your life.
---
Tragic.
---
The community is not a monolith. People have different opinions. Someone who wanted it and made an addon.
---
While US get names like Old Blanchy and Bigglesworth... Blizz be trollin :)
---
Why would anyone using this addon actually use the auto-invite feature? I rarely will invite just anyone to my groups unless I’m putting together a world pvp raid or something like that. I would love to use this to manage my recruitment process and provide a better UI for doing so.
---
That is not how this addon works.  It still interacts with the chat by reading the chat or posting to it.  The addons could theoretically use the hidden addon channel but I doubt they will due to it being much easier to just use the public LFG channel.
---
Still haven't told my wife. She'll figure it out though 🤣
---
&gt; You're obviously an idiot. It's open source, AND he openly had an interview on stream for 2 hours about the addon. "SUPER SHADY!", get a brain child.
---
Oh man yeah that awesome interview where he conveniently forgot to mention the auto-invite feature or the talent inspect option LOL
---
apparently bear asses came from here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2gdi9z/where\_did\_10\_bear\_arses\_come\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2gdi9z/where_did_10_bear_arses_come_from/)
---
It hasn't got any better since then. Were you under the impression that it has?
---
Thoughs about quest mods?
---
I haven't seen a single person complain about them, they're a massive QoL change compared to reading quest logs.
---
They existed in vanilla, dumbass. What happened to NOCHANGES?
---
Can't hold back my excitement!
---
RP realms existed before those addons, and they can exist without them again just fine.
---
I was a Rogue and I did the same....
---
Honestly I love the Horde vs Alliance rivalry on this sub vs the main sub. Here it's just funny banter. The "DAE HORDE BAD" and "HORDE FAVOURITISM" of the main sub, with a dash of "I am a morally superior person to Horde players", was so fucking tiring.
---

---
If they had more then 2 EST realms at name reservation I could have reserved on a server that wasn't exploding. 
---
As it stands anyone who paid to reserve get the shaft because all options for servers at that time are now expected to have 5-10 hour queues
---
Friendly reminder - switch servers if you don't want 6+ hour queues week 1
---
No, it will.  Either people ignore it/it gets banned or it ruins the ecosystem of finding groups.
---
Not exactly like retail because you can have 50 characters on the same realm in retail.
---
Nice
---
Nice edit on the original comment to remove the patronising language sweetie, and explain to me how not knowing a detail about vanilla is evidence someone never played, that's gatekeeping mate.
---
Matchmaker. definitely matchmaker.
---
Please list examples of sexism in classic wow.
---
What if I lost my old account? Will I still not need to purchase?
---
the servers are also massive, and (seemingly) not very faction imbalanced. - We will probably have a way easier time filling dungeon groups with this bigger pop.
---
I hope you're on my server on the other faction =)
---
i was planning to do this as a tank
---
There are so many oh shit moments in dungeons/ raids where you’re oom and looking for something to do. Bandaging yourself and friends might just save you guys from wiping.
---
This is so true.  I used to really socialize with people in BC,. The newer expansions I never say a word to anyone because I don't need to.
---
Known as snipers because they shot from stealth, but not sharpshooters, in particular. 
---
It's a pretty stupid stereotype. They were still using bows and arrows in battles like Little Bighorn (although they also had a number of guns)
---
True!
---
Someone told me that jumping made you run faster.  So whenever I wasn’t in combat or mounted I was jumping.  For like 6 months.
---
Fucking love this, legendary vid
---
And my Totems!
---
What?  AutoInvite is still in retail, you just can't autolist groups for world quests now.
---
'99 here and can guarantee you that only the minority of people my age that are stupid and immature could easily be classified as zoomers. Everyone else is mostly a mixed bag.
---
Yes I played classic. Yes I have my 4th ann to prove I've been playing for over 10 years now.
---
Felt like death.  Can't imagine dying 3 times a year
---
Dude I remember seeing them somewhere between loch modan and the wetlands maybe 4 months after launch. I was definitely impressed their two letter name. 
---
Female human mage I think it was.
---
EAST? I THOUGHT YOU SAID... WEAST.
---
Being a Hunter is gonna be fun :)
---
But that would change the punchline of the joke from "Paladin caught trying to be DPS" to "Paladin trying to sneak into a group while under levelled and DPS" it also doesn't fit into the context of the joke too well.  
---
Main point being, a meme's purpose is to illustrate a joke and regardless of any inaccuracies everybody knew what the joke was and imo it was pretty funny, so it's a good meme.
---
Contrary to what this sub tells you Harod is the only realm Without the risk of dying in a month. 
---
Be glad you got on Herod, Que times will last a week, months of work going down the drain because ur sever is dead hurts more.
---
I just hope for a good faction balance
---
you know, both of these games will be retail in like 90'ish hours.
---
Sigh. I wish they would stop doing obviously horde and alliance names, it just sets the server up to have an unhealthy faction balance. 
---
Also, I wish we knew for \*sure\* that high and full realms are going to have hours long queues. I'd rather play horde on mankrik, and have a good pop, instead of going to westfall, and probably having the server die.
---
If any free transfers happen it'll be on Herod, Faerlina, and/or Whitemane.
---
&gt; Ultimately, I don't think enough people will use this addon to impact the game that badly.
---
We'll see. raider.io made its way as a basically mandatory addon for BFA m+, I won't be surprised if this LFG addon will do the same for classic.
---
Truth.
---
&gt;This isn't 2004
---
Even in 2004 you could do it, i.e. with IRC. It's just that no one cared enough.
---
Maybe it’s like [North Cafeteria](https://community-sitcom.fandom.com/wiki/North_Cafeteria) at Greendale, which is named after Admiral William North and is located on campus in the western portion of the east hall.
---
Yeah it's pretty stupid. On the other hand it is a bit annoying to have to keep raiding MC, BWL etc even when running Naxxramas because there is so good loot in there with a low droprate.
---
You may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
Looks like the the sub is leaning towards a horde bias in classic. I’m going alliance for quick BGs then.
---
For a lot of us, old AV was one of the funnest pvp experiences to date. The modern version just can't compare-- it'd be extremely disappointing if AV didn't release as the same as it was back then honestly, because that's still some of the best times I've had in WoW and I barely even got to play it since I had to play on my stepdad's toons to get in AV since I never got a 51+ in vanilla or BC.
---
yeah I removed that word because I didn't think you could handle criticism, and you clearly can't.
---
If you've never played and never set foot in the stress test, which only required a sub then what's the point of debating with you? I am not asking you to have done naxx or even got to level 60. It was about the talent inspect option. I mean you don't know what you're talking about--simple as that.
---
Agreed.
---
Also if anyone has idea of a good time investment I can do in this weekend till my friend comes back so I dont just waste time. Something it's worth and would do anyway at lvl 60.
---
Well as I wrote if you played vanilla, you are 15 years older. Your world view does change. And well, it's important to take some simple actions to improve the exigence for all.
---
Those challenges also make people step away from dungeons, and solo level because of the hurdle. The addon may also create more oportunities, make people run more dungeons, and experience some amazing runs. People that got fucked up by ninja and toxic player may more easily find replacements. And noobs will get more oportunities to "get gud" and party up. Assuming it does damage and that wasting time spaming chat channels for even hours, maybe to no sucess at all during a play session, is actually what gives meaning to the experience, and not actually playing the dungeon and interact with the group.
---
Orc tanks, actually. It's utterly insane for them.
---
Remnant from the ashes is going to hold every waking hour before launch for me. Its amazing
---
Play on a different realm if you dont like it, but it's nothing new
---
Looking forward to the inner focus+devouring plague macro again.
---
Don’t forget tomorrow starts the new Instagram rule where they can use your photos. Don’t forget Deadline today!!! It can be used in court cases in litigation against you.

The story was pretty shit too tbh
---
What fire? Are you suggesting that a world tree could burn? That'd require some really dumb writing, won't happen.
---
Is that razer naga?
---
Content is easy, it’s bad players that make it hard. And with 40 strangers; there tends to be a few “I wanna play it my way” snowflakes that end up causing wipe after wipe after wipe.
---
... now I see it.
---
That actually may explain  thing or two.
---
I think so! I think WoW classic comes with any active subscription, even if you don’t own BFA. All other expansions now come with the subscription.
---
Have at least one of each honestly
---
I lol'ed
---
It worked for Kharazan, t3 bonuses are just that op
---
I can’t remember if this was considered griefing or not in vanilla since it is a quest spawn the way it is.
---
While horde is chilling in their spikey wooden huts, im gonna chill in my cozy ass inns as alliance
---
A battle against the addons and sites is something you won't win.
---
In the end they will play with other LFG users and the "classic" players will be spamming where other "classic" players can find them.
---
It's not 2004 and the playerbase is not the same. Don't let it ruin your fun.
---
At all level ranges. At any time and place. Some endgame examples of them outrolling others for gear they will only use for offspec are bad, but more hilarious examples are seen while leveling IMO. Nothing like watching a hunter outroll the druid and mage for emberstone staff in deadmines. 
---
&gt;!(Best damage staff for mage for a while, marginal upgrade over staff of westfall. For druid it means they can pass up staff of westfall and take tunic of westfall. I'm still bitter btw)!&lt;
---
I hate you for doing this too

13th question down on the link above looks to indicate the opposite of this post. They want to keep the same dynamic as it was before, at least at launch. Unless you have a video proving that it is actually true.
---
Q. Will there be an Armory for WoW Classic?
---
A. There was no Armory for World of Warcraft until the Burning Crusade. If you wanted to know more about a player’s gear before you invited them to your party, you had to meet them in the world and physically inspect them (and you couldn’t inspect players of the opposite faction until 2.4). You couldn’t see their spec or talent builds when you inspected them, either. To maintain that same dynamic, we won’t have an Armory or profile pages for WoW Classic at launch.
---
Are you like some sort of jehovah’s witness, that instead of preaching god from door to door, you make the above comment in every post in new?
---
Even little Tommy is doing his part!
---
Clearly a rogue, I can't see you sitting in the chair. Nice use if stealth.
---
absolutely, I'm betting 24 hours first day gets you ahead of a lot of people, and that's not even that serious.
---
What server? Cause i plan on making a shammy too, loved it back in the day.
---
This man plays
---
Mafias 😂
---
Gotta get the wife’s favor this time around. No taking any chances. :) love it.
---
Took off the entirety of week 1, gonna be leveling a Gnome mage to start with. See you guys on launch day! Only 3 more sleeps boys.
---
ANYONE ELSE WONDERING IF YOU CAN PLAY WORGEN IN VANILLA. ITS BLIZZARD SO YOU NEVER KNOW
---
With wow classic there will be an influx of players who are older, and hopefully they also gown up not only grown old. I know I did, as a kid in classic sexist jokes seemed funny. Now I know better.
---
Fairbanks is pretty good though.  Herod is just by far the best name by far though so making the ones that are supposed to pull people away mediocre doesn't make sense.
---
I don't know why people play dumb biring map games like that.
---
You should play Victoria 2 instead.
---
Expect for fishermen. Fishermen united in peace!
---
I'm actually really looking forward to the run. It was very memorable for me back in the day.
---
I'd be happy with either path, but I also thoroughly enjoyed TBC and WotLK so I guess I'm biased? I'd like it if they gave you the option to stay on a vanilla server or move your level 60 to a BC server.
---
Light be with you
---
I hear that if you're a bad person everything you say is automatically wrong.
---
Is that true
---
It's almost entirely for pvp. Sometimes in pve when people are oom.
---
If you don't want to use it, don't use it.
---
If you don't want to use discord, don't use it.
---
If you don't want to use in-game chat or voip, don't use it.
---
You can't ban addons that parse chat without getting rid of chat, so just relax and do your own thing.
---
&gt;last week
---
Too soon, Executus!
---
8 posts and all 2 years ago, isn't there a system where you can take over abandoned subreddits?
---
I wonder how many posts have to be flagged before they ban you?
---
Ah my bad, I never really used it so when I heard about people saying it was removed, I assumed it was just across the board.
---
The game can be soloed to 60 but after that you need a guild to raid.
---
You don't need guides unless your looking to do organized content.
---
There are good marco's and addons, for hunter an auto attack timer addon will be a big boon to your damage output.
---
People don't pick hunters to raid because their noobs. They don't pick hunters because they think they need optimal comps, (they don't) like 8 mages for MC that will be gearing slowly. Learn tranq shot at 60 and you'll get into raids.
---
soo soon... yet so far...
---
EU shitlords, more like Baltic edgelords
---
Love it
---
Z is for zone. Why would you confuse people with region?
---
So are you saying that addons which Blizzard supported from day one and let people use the API openly, goes against the game? Strange how the game developer supported it don't you think?
---
Some love to my AMD brother! Hail!
---
If you don't want add-ons used by anyone to interfere with your experience than I suggest you find a private server that has disabled the add-on option completely.
---
That would not be a 'vanilla' experience because add-ons existed and were used EXTENSIVELY. They were used to defeat bosses. But if you want to experience something that didn't happen during Vanilla than you better not look to  Classic.
---
Hell yea! This is awesome. Living breathing server people care about
---
&gt;Please tell us more about this "Spirit of Classic" 
---
Watch blizzard's making of WoW videos and what influences they took from Everquest1 specifically, if you're interested in the details.
---
&gt;why you should be the one who decides how the game should be played.
---
I think blizzard should decide on that, we're only talking.
---
DefendYourself was specifically targeted early in Vanilla. If you were attacked it would automatically turn on auto attack. AFAIK it’s the earliest example.
---
That's also brings up another point -- server only BGs helped promote more balanced servers. If you cared about PVP and didn't want massive queues you could choose the less populated side.
---
I mean they said they were open to the idea of creating more vanilla content beyond naxx, we don't know what will happen. Will all depend on how much support they get over the next year. First few months won't mean anything, but if enough people hang around a year I can easily see them deploying new content.
---
Fairbanks was supposed to be the drama-free off the radar server that no one wanted to go to because of the stupid name.
---
yup
---
People are complaining that it makes finding people while still inside the dungeon too easy. I don't think they know about the global LFG channel.
---
Idk man, Golemagg seems to have the most mature community atm. Can't really say the same for Shazzrah.
---
I do not care what people spew online. Its the internet. People spewing stupid shit in world chat is like 90% of the fun of it. I doubt many of the people who say stupid shit are actually racist or sexist, its just funny. And even if they are actually racist or sexist just block them, its that easy.
---
Why are you being such a dick?
---
I know some real losers too
---
this is awesome. Would be even more awesome if this picks up and becomes active.
---
BLIT
---
I feel that people will become much more open minded once they see the queues.
---
I understand your arguement. I just disagree for the legitimate reasons I point out. Also your arguements are nice, but don't really hold up as these people can all be in the same group. 
---
I am also against a global chat channel like /LFG. This should not be in the game. We are all part of the same server community. However we are split into different groups. 
---
Not a bunch of homogeneous zoomers who all wear the same vans shoes with a herschel backback.
---
It's worth it if you need the keys, but this will take getting used to.  
---
I'd stay stick to alt,shift,strg+1-5 for binds.
---
Kindly give an example of the type of sexism we need to look out for.
---
Is it when one call a female char babe or honey?
---
Is it when one kill a female char in pvp?
---
...asking for a friend!
---
But flip the map! Fake news are trying to spread a FAKE image of the world. It is flipped, people! BELIEVE ME!
---
Imagine caring about being forced to play the game in a way that impacts user experience poorly.
---
It’s going to be really hard to find groups without this addon unless it gets banned or restricted.
---
Joanas seems to be the only one I've seen that is intended to be optimised for speed.
---
Frankly, if the guide can save me 10 minutes, I've already recouped my cost.
---
Except they weren't widely used.
---
And blizzard's already made some changes that pursue the spirit instead of how it was, so not sure what your point is.
---
It wouldn’t be classic with a LFG addon, Cba finding a group? Well get back to questing then.
---
I can think of a streamer (Kargoz) that be jelly of that. Probably all orc hunters as well lol.
---
Yeah, it's definitely not ideal if you're a person who wants to experience endgame. However the communities on RP servers are more tightly knit from my experience
---
Bigglesworth...
---
Why does Blizzard hate the west coast pvp servers?
---
This. You'll still need to walk to the dungeon. You'll still only be grouping with people on your server. If someone leaves the group mid-dungeon some new random person isn't just going to show up next to you a few seconds later.
---
I both love and hate this. The positive? Possibly making amazing friends by grouping with strangers. The big bad thing is all the elitist jerks making it impossible for progression. Hugs to all!
---
There are no races. It's just a social construct.
---
loving these
---
wow is less grindy than runescape and has more engaging combat. 1-60 is roughly the time it takes to get one skill to 99 in runescape.
---
Thanks man that's dope! Does it seem pretty good ?
---
He would have gotten away with it if it weren't for that pesky warrior!
---
We wiped 2 times getting to the dungeon. Once we finally made it in we made it like 60% of the way to the first boss to which the healer said "yeah i didnt think it would take this long i gotta work in the morning" and 2 others agreed.
---
While I enjoy the OSRS subreddit for the original content (occasionally), it feels like it’s dominated by 12 year old boys most of the time. Both have a thing they completely outrage and cry about for a few days, and then it blows over.
---
Afraid you can't blast a few Eve players out of the Crater? Sounds like some great emergent gameplay for the Alliance boys on Fairbanks.
---
😲
---
26th is mine.  About time it means something
---
The fuck is "Dungeon Group Finder"?
---
This is so bad I almost think OP is memeing.
---
I mean if the addon isn't spamming "Mage LFG" in the chat then the player will just do it manually.
---
Where are all these broccoli IQ trolls coming from?
---
OP: "Many of you were in highschool when you were playing Vanilla. By not assigning yourself homework, quitting your job, and dating underaged girls you aren't really playing Classic in the spirit it was meant to be played in."
---
Moooore
---
What does Wowhead have listed?
---
Thankfully the servers start up right after I'd get back from lunch on my first day of college for sophomore year!
---
Maybe if someone could mention each racial specific class ability, so everyone could figur it that would be something they appreciated more than the racials? 😁
---
The desk doesn't seem strong enough to handle rage punches
---
you have to rage punch you desk
---
\#nochanges
---
Ah yeah I agree auto invites are probably a step too far.
---
On the other point though, server discords already exist. We're already going to have people grouping up from anywhere in the world instead of having to go to cities like the old days
---
is this for player only or enemy? i updated quartz to hopefully work for classic(wont know until launch..) but only for player(self) casting, way too much work to make quartz work with enemy casts haha.
---
Wait where is Baltland at?
---
So many people have no idea what this addon actually does. They somehow think it's in any way similar to modern LFG.
---
Such a great way to build a community
---
Infinitely more than used irc
---
Blizzard told us “you think you do, but you don't.”
---
and now you're doing the same to me. What a hypocrisy. How dare you tell me how to play the game the way I want to. You think I actually *don't* want to play with CalltoArms like I did in Vanilla?
---
Fuck outta here with the hypocrisy.
---
Nothing
---
no bro, this addon will be the death of classic wow /s
---
The Peggle addon is the epitome of the vanilla spirit. How dare you say otherwise.
---
(auto attack timers were WIDELY used by many of the best players in vanilla. What hunter didn't use one?)
---
DBM also has an auto invite feature btw.
---
So does ElvUI and Leatrix.
---
Things for me to prep.  go to bed at 6 am.  I work gaveyards anyways so no big deal.  Prep out food for 7 straight days.  Deciding between a good instant pot beef stew and a mix of tuna salad and some take out.
---
What about the pointless obsession with:
---
managing your pets, managing your bags, running useless timers in your head, reading the quest log, clicking through AH tabs, etc.
---
When you optimize everything you get modern WoW.
---
It was badass at yogg saron. As a druid healer 50% of my spells were dispells.
---
I say the contrary and tell you that it is a waste to be DPS in dungeons, because you really get the short end of the stick.
---
You won't be invited often as long as a warrior is tanking (90% of the time), because why would a warrior invite you to "ninja" his 2handers, shields, 1handers, mail armor, later plate armor if he can just get a rogue who can not wear mail, plate, axes, shields and are as plentiful as warriors? 
---
Rogues will also do more damage in a pug due to +5% hit and other talents. Warriors only really come into their own right at a much later level or coordination like having 4 warriors and a resto shaman cleaving their way through dungeons with wf totem, but that rarely if ever happens.
---
Just wait until launch and those full servers have 10k queues...Blaumeux will be full by the end of the week too.  
---
P.s.  Bleameux is French. So using one of those translators for pronunciation works!
---
&gt;This makes groups overcoming a challenge more likely to stay together rather than disband or kick an underperforming member
---
Ha. You never played before group finder did you? God people on this sub have no idea what it was really like.
---
Call to Arms was a vanilla addon. It watched all chat channels you were in, and in its UI it listed any messages containing LFG/LFM/LFXM. You could then further filter this list to find people specifically LFG/LFM for the instances you were looking for.
---
If you were the group maker, you could also put the usual LFG/LFM messages into the chat channel of your choice through it to advertise to people without the addon.
---
There was also a global chat channel specific to the addon. Anyone with the addon could see anyone else with the addon who was advertising that they were LFG/LFM, without having to be in the usual city chat channels.
---
There was some extra functionality if you were the group maker and other people were trying to join you via the addon; you could specify what class(es) you wanted for each remaining party slot, for example. But few enough people used the addon that generally it was used for viewing the list of people LFG/LFM in the usual chat channels.
---
That’s because Priest is the only class that gets the extra racials. Priest = best class.
---
No problems at all
---
I spent way too much yime on those forums back in the day. I was hoping Blizz would bring it back for Classic.
---
Priest is the only class with race specific abilities
---
Is that Ner'zhul next to Durotan?
---
Priests are the only class that learn racial specific spells.
---
If by external site you mean the server discords...you're correct.
---
Right, but again, not playing the stress test is evidence they never played vanilla in what way?
---
Like you literally referred to them as a new player and said "clearly you never played vanilla" because they opted to wait till release? That's just daft lol.
---
I think people will naturally be better and should makes the raids much easier, but trying to fill a group of 40 people and getting them to run to the raid and not drop after the first wipe  is going to be the hard part.  
---
Even if you get a group good enough do only do 30 people, you're going to need to go back to a city to fill spots when people rage quit from wipes.  
---
Hopefully the fact that it's just one server and you'll gain a rep as a rage quitter or whatever is enough to prevent some of this, but overall I can't see it being a viable option for regular raiding.
---
Woa dude that's very well done. Lotsa work put into that.
---
WTT Rage (Herod) for Fear/Dot/Dots/Rage (warrior/warlock) names on Skeram.
---
yeah but that's just as good. the point of not using a lfg addon is you have to *actually talk to people.* automation tools like lfg removes the need to communicate with people and leads to very antisocial tendencies (which then leads to toxic behavior, since people aren't caring about other people they start to only care about themselves).
---
Hi, /u/Sleepyheals

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cu9m7u/blizzard_please_allow_lfg_groups_i_dont_want_to/).

We dont want a compromise. We just dont want an addon for it.
---
I'm inspired by this to make my own criminal syndicate within my server I don't think I can run anything big scale but maybe like the peacebloom mafia we all get gathermate and camp the shit out of elwynn then we have all the peacebloom and can control the market
---
#Wanting to ban CalltoArms-style addons from Vanilla is the community's version of “you think you do, but you don't.” Hypocrites.
---
Yep. For being a gold farmer they sure knew how to make everyone jealous by afking in cities :D
---
I remember pugging MC in the last couple of months before BC dropped.
---
I'm talking about in general. For most, the entire point was beating regular players. For those that did like fighting twinks, I imagine at some point they realized it wasn't much different than pvping at max level and figured their time was better spent on their mains.
---
I pee'd on an electric fence once.
---
&gt;The addon allows you to find replacements without leaving the dungeon
---
Because u can't without it ?? the Lfg chat is global no !
---
&gt;  If there are any problems in the run (and people will run into problems), people will be more likely to leave the group to find another 
---
That bullshit to me u don't kick people that easily, even if u can find a replacement easily, if this guy is far form ur instance u have to wait for him to come end up loosing more time because u kick an underperforming member.
---
It doesn't matter if a dps underperforme if u finish ur instance.
---
Most Priests will be leveling as Shadow. Can Shadow Priests reliably heal all leveling dungeons?

I burnt out on my rogue. He was my first ever char. I got him to 40 something and was getting my ass kicked because I was still pretty shit at the game and didn't have a solid understanding of things.
---
After coming back I rolled Hunter. I played him for years! Special place in my heart and all that.
---
Clever Ruseman
---
Only needs to fill low-med for one layer. No pvp server will feel empty as people doom and gloom about here. If full servers don't shed a lot of players, queues will persist over a month.
---
Even when I was grouped up with guildies most of the time I would consistently meet new cool players, some of which ended up joining ours
---
That’s actually how I joined my first raiding guild. Joined a dungeon group farming scholo and got along great with them. 
---
The time it takes to level to 60 and then endgame combined with the social aspects of vanilla make it very easy to making lasting friends.
---
Actually it's chat, group/guild chat especially. 
---
And It's especially when it's aimed at the player behind the character. 
---
On non-RP realms calling to a character would be usually considered talking to a player unless.
---
Nah, that's just ganking noobs in barrens. most people don't give a frak about talking to random people in RL or in WoW.
---
It's like when people complain about everybody always being on their smartphone and the impact of social media, and people somehow have a straight face when they respond with "don't use them then if you don't like them."     
---
     
---
There is a huge difference between "wishing one was in the 2002 social environment" and "being that one fucking obsolete weirdo in 2018 who is isn't participating at all in decent chunks of modern mainstream society."

________

To be fair, according to some of the posters here, people are misrepresenting just how extensive this how is and what exactly it does.  But that's a separate argument than "just don't use it!"
---
Ban all of u
---
Im gonna play both games. Classic most by a long shot. But im still gonna play bfa and future expansions.
---
Came here to say this. I have a feeling the people wanting an LFG system will not be in the game long anyway.
---
Heisenberg\_IRL just stated some facts and asked you some questions.
---
"The facts you are stating are wrong because they prove my narrative wrong"
---
The mafia is a network of horde and alliance guilds. They would get paid gold per hour to camp the devilsaurs in a raid group and since they had guys on each faction it made it hard to do anything about it.
---
Good luck dad.
---
If you have that one specific name you want to use it's still possible to fill realms you will never play. I have made characters on two realms and it's pretty sure I am not going to play on two realms. I bet I am not only one doing this.
---
I'm talking about player transfers.
---
you'll have people already with friends and in guilds, but after launch day they man be encouraged to switch. even if they were able to log in more than once. because they'll realize that queues suck.
---
They might have gotten away with it on pservers but Blizzard will come down on them hard for disrupting gameplay and economy. Not too worried about it.
---
My bad about the lie part. I miss read your bracket statement as (thats what they basically said they would do) and is entirely my bad. Though they wouldn't actually have to ban all addons they would just have to make it so addons couldn't communicate to other addons on different players. 
---
Like i said before if it just parsed the chat then sure maybe that's not so bad. but it doesn't just do that. It also automates group creation and communicates with its self on others to create groups removed from the rest of the game. "But oh just use the specific chat for the addon." People can just and /join lfg without the need for a addon, a outside website or a disc server.
---
ibtl
---
Awh man, I literally just got a warm feeling looking at this picture! Simply amazing how this game affects us. 😊👍🏻 Good job mate!
---
Although one of the biggest complaints with how it works in PoE is that players are forced to go out-of-game for that part of gameplay. Before those sites were around, existing tools (forums and trade chat) were used instead.
---
A similar thing would happen if a significant portion of the Classic WoW playerbase started using a website to LFG: in-game LFG would get harder and harder as it is replaced by the website. An addon that can integrate in-game LFG player spam wouldn't fracture the community the same way.
---
oh god the OG of energy drinks from back in the day, sadly I have to order them online cause none of the stores sell them here anymore, RIP CompUSA
---
I am sorry about that mate, that’s what I wanna avoid he is like my best friend, and I really want him to try and see how amazing this game is
---
&gt; That's a really bad slippery slope argument.
---
Usually this is a fallacy, but just sometimes what would be a fallacy is actually totally valid. So on the contrary, it's a very good argument because we have empirical data of this very thing happening, so it's a very substantiated claim.
---
Then allow addons later on, not right off the bat. I don't care about how long you think you've played, I was questing in Westfall before any addons were available, and it was awesome. I can agree, certain addons are very helpful. But if you think you need addons to beat the game, you sir, are the pleb.
---
Actually to NOT have the LFG was one of the MAIN reasons to quit retail...
---
I dont like the zombiemode-LFG-community. Only thing they say "Hi" and "sum", if you are really reeally lucky: "you have invis?"
---
The auto join wouldn’t be smart though. That I can see being disabled.
---
I swear to god the only thing this sub is doing is complaining
---
That's it? 4 more realms the day before launch? It's going to be too late if they add the rest after launch, because most people will be too stubborn to reluctantly switch servers after they've invested time into one of them.
---
If it's anything like the old LFG addons, that's not true. CTA looked at people LFG/LFM without the addon, and advertised your groups you were trying to form in whatever chat channels you wanted. People without the addon weren't left out at all- they were the majority of people in your groups!
---
There's *no reason* to design an LFG addon in a way that excludes people without it. The whole point is to make building groups faster. If you're limiting your pool of players by ignoring people typing LFG out themselves, you're not doing that, and another better addon *will*.
---
Only WoW can kill WoW
---
the face expressions on these are great
---
Thinking about taking a few days off to play but I dunno if I will.
---
Been hitting the gym pretty hard since the start of the year and REALLY want to keep up the routine. It's going to be harder to keep up the motivation though I think.
---
I have a wife and 4 kids so won't be playing hardcore hours but I'm going to be levelling as quickly as I can, as in vanilla I took way too long and this time I want to be max level to get the most out of the game before they decide to re-release TBC and I quit again :D
---
Yeah and one of them is a resounding no looking for group mechanic.
---
Well, it is on the west coast of the Eastern Kingdoms, so maybe it could be both or either?
---
I agree it killed the community in retail but I doubt people looking for groups in chat will disappear in classic.  I’m not for this addon by any means I was just trying to remain optimistic
---
I just fail to see the logic in having two bristling full servers, which will likely have hours of login queue and then expecting a 2nd set servers to be completely dead.
---
Lucifron and Everlook are compeltely full more than a week before release. Where are people who start at release supposed to go? 
---
Or, if a server is expected to hold between 5-10k people at the end, do they really think, there aren't 20k germans who want to play WoW classic longterm?
---
It just makes no sense to me to expect a 2nd server to be dead, when the first ones are overvrowded. Heck, even 20% of the pop currently on Lucifron can likely fill up 3-4 servers post layering.
---
I don’t get paid to play videogames.
---
Not the people who asked for classic for so long. It was a social game, funny that a mmorpgs actually felt like a world and that is what people want. You can gank noon in thousands of other games. Nothing special about that. A living breathing world with other people? That is something special.
---
This existed in vanilla and on private servers where are the #nochanges crew??
---
Take up fishing as well. You can get bolts of cloth from the various different fishing spots via crates. It's how I leveled up as an enchanter/tailor.
---
the old look is so much better :( not sure why they changed it
---
i think thats the gist of it
---
seems like automation (i.e botting...at least partially) and that is generally against the ToU
---
Even worse... Bobby fucking kottick
---
Im not worried. I can farm and use an addon to find other people who want to do a dungeon with our going to a manor city or zone? Count me in.
---
To many people are crying. Its 2019 not 2004
---
U will get banned rofl
---
"Take 2-4 hours time". Nice ;)
---
Collusion should be bannable in the TOS
---
Get the shirt app and make it a reality. Mine is already ordered.
---
and also they had people 24/7 working the shift.
---
I hope that's just your gpu lol jesus christ
---
Depends a lot about server. I did some research some time ago and found ones going for 500$. So it's possible to get one if you just want "any server". Of course finding one that you played on is pretty hard and you had to be extremely lucky that someone puts one on sale.
---
If you don't like it, just don't use it.
---
This is so cool!
---
Mr. Bigglesworth?
---
Fuck you, it's the only Eastern realm with a good name.
---
?
---
MC/UBRS were nightmares in the beginning because there was no default raid frames. While yes in the first two months addon usage was uncommon post-50 their use became ubiquitous.
---
I'm having lots of fun with Remnant from the ashes. It recently came out.
---
They will be banned.
---
BWL, AW, and Naxx didn't exist when the game was released
---
By your idiotic logic those things shouldn't be in Classic.
---
While I probably won't use it. I really don't get the hate, if it just moved the chatter from /2 to a private conversation.
---
I thought they were opening them early for a moment there.
---
Just gonna push that heart attack back another year.
---
Obviously if you have an advantage, it will make you a better player. What you fail to understand is why Classic is returning at all. Not really sure why you are all GUNGHO for addons. Sure they are helpful, don't you want a challenge? ARE WE NOT GOING BACK FOR A CHALLENGE?
---
What are you even talking about and why do you have that shitty attitude? Blizz can easily do something about addons that go against the spirit of vanilla.
---
Read the disclaimer. I am not intending to do this, nor trying to brigade people. I am interested in a discussion.
---
Gotta make a macro that breaks MC and casts shadow word pain on them as they're falling so they die in the water, have to run back to their corpse and THEN find their way back up. :-)
---
burn it to the ground
---
All it does is cut down on chat spam. It's still not the horrible auto teleporting of retail
---
Lol you keep trying to talk down to me when you reek or casualness.  Shitters are always looking for ways to justify them being bad oh sure you're better but you used addons so it doesn't count.
---
You were bad at the game then you'll be bad at the game now.  Every good player used addons.
---
Unless there is no warrior in the raid or the ones present are complete noobs, they have no right jn my eyes
---
Haha the game has been dead for many months now
---
The East even got WESTfall. What type of fuckery is this
---
Instead you surrender to something as simple as appendicitis.
---
Are you a trans/LGBT? You sound like it.
---
Old Blanchy is definitely the best
---
Read the disclaimer. If you think not talking about potential security loopholes prevents them from being abused, you have a lot to learn about IT security.

My BF is going to be real disappointed when i won't heal his sorry warrior ass anymore. The demons will keep me company. Muahaha!

Why is his mouth upside down?

What name ?

It really is, but them enchanting $$$s tho.
---
Yeah! Gonna stealth and fuck up some days.
---
Don't want to intrude, but, hey, if you think any sort of sexism, racism or something like that is "funny" - even knowing people out there might be offended or mildy-to-severely affected by that - I'm sorry to tell you but you're those things yourself.
---
It isn't just "social justice", you see? It's just plain, basic respect people seem to forget sometimes.
---
People have to endure enough jerks on the outside world already. Don't be another and all will be fine.
---
Yeah, I'm talking about the times when the gender get's raveled usually in group/guild chat. In general if you see somebody spewing a ton of shit at someone it's a good idea to call them out on that.

This is pretty stupid. You complain about LFG add on to make the same thing to complain about it. I bet your the kind of person that sticks a stick into their bike while moving
---
How does that counter what he said?
---
To people who want LFG queue, want flying mounts etc.. yup.
---
But it's ultimately subjective and it's all about finding the right balance
---
The Alliance needs you. Every single person counts. For the Alliance.

💯
---
In vanills there was the meeting stone. You signed up to it and anyone clicking on it could see you were interested. It was never used as no-one wanted to walk all the way to the dungeon first.
---
I don't know why they didn't just add that feature to the Org innkeeper.
---
You guys are so fun
---
I don't think that the mechanics of WoW lend themselves to ironman mode all that well but some kind of official restricted / challenge mode would certainly be a lot of fun.
---
All those comments about RuneScape being a bad game and all

Except he said r/OSRS, not the game itself

This comment section itself proves OP point

I'm doing the same! Stay strong, for the Alliance!

&gt; I have a very broad view
---
Your comments *really* don't reflect that. Based on your dialogue in this thread, it's very difficult to have any sort of discussion when your stance is basically that the game can not be enjoyed without addons.
---
Blizzard have a copy of the old 1.12 client but it isn't compatible with the current servers so they had to rebuild it to work properly on modern technology. They could make the old client work but it was very easy to exploit and to fix the security issues it was better to rebuild.
---
Don't know what you're implying. Have fun with your server.

Sunday will pass fast for me at least and Monday morning.

Stop by and pick up some good pizza, then be ready to sit in a queue.

Gehennas didn't exist then lmao

These are all super dope! Wish my server, Whitemane, had a cool album tagline too though. Like “Arise, my Champions” or something along those lines

I've played Warlock on a Pserver as Alliance, to make matters worse I was a Human! I didn't find it that bad, to be honest. You're going to have some trouble with Rogues, as most of them are UD and they're a hard counter anyway... Though I think some of the min/maxers are dramatizing it to be honest. That being said, it's not a 100% chance you're going to lose against an UD Rogue, probably because the kids play them and not all of them are decent.
---
i thought it was pretty obvious that this would be satire but i guess not
---
Wonderful! I apologize that it is more made for how I personally plan to play  Classic Wow throughout the leveling process and leveling within a trio, however, I am glad if it can help anyone. ;)
---
What do you mean? Wow isn’t out yet...
---
The answer is yes. Some people like to put metal plates under their skin for the form it creates or to screw some items in it (not sure for her, but look at her skull too)
---
I love how Ion is literally the devil when he doesn't completely agree with the subreddit but is the 2nd coming of Jesus when he does agree. Also, he doesn't agree, I'm not sure if you can't tell that's just a clip taken out of context.

I have, that's why I am now ignoring you.

---
I agree, fuck this addon, block the global networks that allow for the exchange.
---
I second this. Troll look awesome
---
Level as arms and make sure you get tactical mastery. It is very important, doubly so if you want to level with a group in my opinion. Make your build similar to [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023050213520105011-05) and you should do just fine. Feel free to swap points around like deflection for imp heroic strike, sword spec for any other weapon spec, or more points in improved hamstring.
---
Personally I would keep going down the fury tree at 45+, but you're welcome to move in to the protection tree if you want to be a bit tankier.
---
Good, murder that newfangled shit
---
I’ll be with Horde Arugal, any SG/MY players here too?
---
Haha, classic move. Open new server, remove all the old ones!
---
I'd like to think the defining differences between the two games are the literal 14 years of changes between when the game came out and now.
---
You're being willfully hardheaded. It's not just changing the interface. Stop denying features of this addon. You want the addon, and that's fine. But misrepresenting it and downplaying it is just stupid.
---
This addon will change gameplay for everyone that uses lfg. Not just the people using it. Especially if it gets popular enough to become near mandatory. As I said in another post (that you've conveniently ignored, yet responded to two others), if people can fill groups without ever posting in chat, the lfg channels will become dead. Why would a group leader bother whispering the few people posting in lfg when they're getting whispers from people using the addon and are able to browse the groups available? Why bother getting into an lfg channel when you can pop open this addon and browse the groups trying to form? I mean, how many people use the LFG channel on retail, when you can use dungeon finder and other raid?
---
I get it. People have become accustomed to things in retail. People don't want to spend 45 minutes trying to find a group. People don't want to deal with trolls and whatever. There are other addons that make the game simpler or easier and no one, or very few people anyway, care about those, so why care about this one? I'd say 3 of those 4 reasons are valid enough to want the addon. I'm not one of these "you're trash, I'm blacklisting you for using the addon" people. But jesus, you're so grossly denying what this addon does, it's ridiculous.
---
Hahaha my sentiments exactly... *Sigh*

All the loot little man

Go fury and keep a sword and shield on you dad.
---
How Actiblizzard got people to pay for the same content twice.
---
No, they aren't. Not compared to sockets, which are everywhere on TBC gear, and nowhere on vanilla gear.
---
Frostfire regalia, 9 pieces:
---
50 hit, 110 crit, 313 spell power, 162 stamina, 177 int
---
Set bonuses: Reduced evocation cooldown, chance for 200 spell damage on cast.
---
TBC pre-bis, 9 pieces:
---
Spellstrike Hood
---
Spaulders of Oblivion
---
Spellfire Robe
---
Crimson Bracers of Gloom
---
Spellfire Gloves
---
Spellfire Belt
---
Spellstrike Pants
---
Extravagant Boots of Malice
---
Sparkling Arcanite Ring
---
74 hit, 133 crit, 111 stam, 138 int, 367 spell power
---
Set bonuses: Chance for 92 spell damage on cast, 7% intellect -&gt; spell damage. That's &gt;40 spell power in raid.
---
So, T3 has:
---
-24 hit, -23 crit, -74 spell power,  +51 stam, +41 int.
---
... And 14 sockets. Which are worth 112 spell power, or 164 stamina, or 112 spell hit, or *any other combination of stats that you might want.*
---
Go fury. Much better group helpfulness simply due to your killing ability. Prot is significantly weaker in pvp, and if you have a healer you're gonna have fun.
---
population: 99% A / 1% H
---
I'm going Warlock on Alliance. I will also go out of my way to kill any UD :)
---
Lmfaoooo
---
Groupfinder? You mean General or LFG chat?
---
I played on EU-Baelgun (PVE) in classic. We had well over 90% Alliance VS just under 10% horde.
---
What did that do you ask?
---
Well Horde had instant Battleground invites all day.
---
Alliance had to wait up to 7 hours to get into a single WSG or AB.
---
This led to people literally leaving in the middle of the raid once their BG queue popped.
---
That was... beautiful.
---
I personally never enjoyed the 19 bracket, too few abilities at that point. I personally had a lot of fun and success with a 29 rogue which i later turned into a 39 twink
---
Blizzard does have the original 1.12 reference client that is why we are getting classic so i do not see where you got the idea that no one has the data.
---
&gt; Even just representing your mythic keystone as an item looted from chests and that has to be physically placed in a gizmo at the start of the dungeon is nice.
---
I wish all dungeon/raid difficulty selection was like this. Just ticking a box in a menu is lame compared to actually doing a thing in world
---
11 has a trust system.
---
....the fuck
---
How did CallToArms work? You expect to make claims with 100% confidence but to have to provide no evidence? Who cares if an addon existed but was never used? How is that relevant?
---
Or /who
---
Thalnos
---
Lmao
---
This guy is your average authoritarian, this is how they think.
---
They constantly want to control other people, and control what the norm is.
---
When they are out of their bubble of influence they become very confused as to why other people think they are nuts.
---
How cool. It's a pretty crazy achievement in the gaming world. Blizz has got to be the first to do anything like this huh.
---
Why? It was part of the experience for many of us. People should be able to enjoy classic the way they want. If you don't want to use the addon then you'll still be able to find groups without it. Nothing in vQueue or CTA stopped people from spamming in General or Trade.
---
I don't like damage meters, but you don't see me begging Blizzard to get rid of them. I understand some players like it and they should be able to enjoy WoW the way they want. It's about understanding that people find enjoyment in WoW in different ways.
---
It's just a different hoop.  It's not really extra.  
---
The only problem is that external sites are *worse* because these addons include players who don't use the addon, while external sites are limited to players who use the external site, meaning eventually to even do instances everyone will have to use the solution outside of the game.
---
This isn't a dungeon finder. Stop being retarded.
---
I don't even really get behind the pc. Maybe I'm subconsciously creating goodwill with my so?
---
i reported that comment have fun with that lobotomy
---
That just means something like Gearscore is better than ilvl. Even without that though ilvl is still good, because it lets you vet before you have to spend time checking people's gear and such. Some people may mis-use it but if so you probably don't want to be playing with them anyways. If they mess up that then they're probably messing up other stuff as well.
---
Added to my list of useful bookmarks. 👍🏼
---
never played private server, eh?
---
I was on vacation the last 2 weeks and probably was never so scared in my life that the plane would crash and I would miss WoW classic. Luckily, I made it back and won't leave the house anymore now.
---
You are not forced to run with people that are invited, it's just so you can talk with them while in party if you opt for it. People probably won't even use auto invite unless making big raids for random stuff like raiding a capital or otger fun stuff. It just parse chat messages and make it easier to request invites.
---
So uh... where can I find this dungeon group finder addon? To uhh... make sure I don't accidentally download it, yea...
---
Perfectly explained.
---
Ever play other classes?
---
I’ve been thinking about the additional abilities thing. Part of me is cruel and likes 19 for additional relative strength from true BiS and enchant power.
---
Now make one of a druid rooting characters under water so they drown and that's a great representation of what I'll be doing as often as possible.
---
Players did vote on changes, and that's how we got retail.
---
The time WOTF is a pain is when you're charming them for a big fat Soul Fire hit. Though it's not the end of the world, you learn to deal with it.
---
that was gear rating that did that
---
I never stopped playing, losers.
---
Yes I'm sure Blizzard's top priority as a company is to ruin a niche community in the relelease of a 15 year old game.. they'll make a faithful recreation *except* for this one thing. They are out to get you!
---
&gt;V4
---
Hope it will be done soon.
---
Call to arms was basically the meeting stone feature but in addon, or basically BCs system. Substantially less powerful and automated and carries the issue of needing many other people to use the addon. So not quite the LFG tool.
---
no one is paying for classic, it’s free with a sub to retail: however, they got people to pay for the game 7 times, so there is that.
---
The whole reason I'm back here is for the classic WoW experience, you better believe I'm gonna log on for the queues, lag, rollbacks, reboots, and crashes on launch day!
---
Theres another side to this. If gathering groups becomes easier (it wont, because you will have more demand than supply of certain classes), the group gatherer might not be in the position to reserve every fucking thing just because he spammed the chat.
---
A lot of people, me included, dont want to do the chat spam for different reasons. This could help get more instance runs DONE, if the bar of gathering a group is lowered.
---
So if you want to have a discussion about it, lets talk about the positives too. Or is this more of a pitchfork thing already and we want to burn shit after reading the topic ?
---
What’s west of west fall you might ask? EST time zone.
---
I feel so dirty for sitting through that entire thing... lol
---
Punishment for using these addons is a month of retail-WoW !
---
Fair, I'm like that with my job not with games though it's weird.
---
witty detail, the undead cant face screens. once you target hem you already dead
---
What? My argument is just as sound as yours.
---
Your argument is totally nuts, I apply the same exact logic, you think I'm nuts.
---
You have zero self-awareness.
---
The thing is, even if they did log Addon Messages, which I am certain they don't, because we are talking about very large amounts of data here (Trade chat would be almost a silent meditation chamber in comparison), there is no way to determine the origin. Yes, they likely can tell which player sent what message, but not which addon (in ITSec we call that "message origin"), because that information is provided by the client, meaning its user controlled.
---
No, piss off.
---
assisting assembling a group removes player interaction?
---
you don't want to roll on whitemane;
---
the memers are borderline cringey and if you peeked into the discord it's pretty bad.
---
Luckily Bigglesworth opened up and it was an easy sell for my guild to move there.
---
I have a feeling a __lot__ of people are in the same boat; Not wanting to roll on fairbanks or blaumeux, but will gladly leave whitemane for bigglesworth.
---
What if blizzard would just ban all addons for first year
---
I am wheezing. This has to be a joke, god PLEASE tell me this isn’t real.
---
I heard this but also heard the gays of proudmore will be going to Atiesh as well.  Anyone can verify which ones?
---
You have no idea how this add-on works.
---
12 Pro-fe-ssions
---
but then it sounds like pro fashion or something.
---
i think you should if you are concerned about maximizing your experience. being ahead of most of the player base shortly after launch is an easy way to snowball and stay on top as the server progresses, even if you play semi-casually afterwards
---
It's all good buddy, you'll get the operation and then kill yourself. I'll be on online.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers
---
what?
---
With everyone at launch, it’s not going to be pleasant in any starting zone, might as well just save time by staying where you start on launch and grinding to at least level 5
---
Say yes to my ignore list.
---
I think hes referring to your discriminatory behavior.
---
Because if my SO and Friends encouraged gaming, I would likely not be very successful in real life. I for one get pretty addicted to games and they keep me balanced. Yeah it sucks not being able to play every day but most people don’t have time for that.
---
&gt; Do you think there’s an audience for this? 
---
Absolutely! The nice thing about MMO's is there is a lot of stuff you can create content around. Lore, PVP, Raiding, Leveling, Player Experience, RP, etc. Almost all of those will have an audience.
---
It's easy to join world chat/lfg chat.  But that doesn't make it easier to fill a 5 man group by doing so.
---
No not at all lol. Look up Old School RuneScape.
---
Difference is, they released that game like 4 days to a week after they announced it was possible.
---
And now OSRS is bigger than “modern” Runescape.
---
Please go back to classic tourist
---
Why should people watch you instead of the hundreds of other established streamers (and probably thousands of unknown like yourself)?
---
Well from my experience and also the data I found, the path is always few points in demono and affli, then filling one or the other three depending if you will have a lot of PvP along the way.
---
Mage or Druid???? Please help. I will be only doing PvP and these were the only two classes I ever played growing up as a kid. Thank you in advance
---
Yea, but without this you have to alt tab to find someone in discord, so this is bad. Literal argument against this addon in this thread. What. The. Fuck.
---
I won't say females suck at games but males are way better at games.
---
If you want to call me sexist for not wanting to play with female players because the are not as good as male players, well go ahead and do that!
---
The ignorant part is not accepting facts and fact is the average male are way better with gaming, WoW included, than the average female player.
---
he's a what?
---
Then don't use them and stop trying to tell people how to enjoy the game. You aren't special, and your opinion isn't law
---
Only 87 hours now. The clock is ticking.
---
I still don't see how using an addon to type search for a group changes the game in any capacity compared to spamming /2 with "lfm wc need heals and tank"
---
You don't get a teleport, you're still grouping with people who are on your server. Who play in guilds on your server.
---
You're still having to chat and build parties you just get to actually find other people who want to group instead of being the douche that uses "/who warr"
---
If lfg chat was actually used by people and slightly more useful there wouldn't be a need for the addon.
---
To me your argument is basically the same as someone saying we shouldn't use voice chat since vanilla wow didn't have it
---
I should not call gay people gays???
---
&gt; Why do people keep beating this drum 'blizzard needs data!'
---
If they really need data they shouldn't expect people to pay them for it.
---
Thanks for the input!!
---
leave it like it was please
---
They already did, 2 months ago. It's nearby yhe same thing as CallToArms we had back in Vanilla. Good we have nearby all the same old addons. #NoChanges
---
gay people. Homosexuals
---
Plan on enjoying BGs as much as I can until the twinks get there and ruin it. Then I'll just play at 60.
---
Sorry if this is out of line but have you tried sitting on him and farting?
---
That's nice on paper. On reality, you have a melee eating cleaves, doing less than mediocre damage, and outrolling plate and 2h drops.
---
&gt;Community is huge draw for classic wow, and being able to replace someone instantly takes away from that. 
---
Community is what you do AFTER the fucking party invite. Not how you got the group together. Classic was about keeping and building your reputation. So that people WANTED to invite you, because it was you. If someone is going to use addon like this, nothing about the community changes.
---
I too am annoyed you can inspect talents.
---
When you send whispers trying to flirt with them. Repeatedly. Yes it did happen.
---
Lmao thats the hardcore progression path
---
Where is that Intro from? Was it Sword Art Online?
---
what
---
If anything you'll just get more gear when you do catch up to them less competition
---
is there a disrespect/piss on grave key?
---
!remindme 30 days
---
You couldn't drag any UI elements in Vanilla.
---
Discriminating is the thing you shouldn't do.
---
Hahahah not yet but does that usually work ??
---
Oh should I be laughing at the south park live to win jokes or the epic memes of people poorly photoshopping wow armor on other images?
---
they could but it's too expensive so nope....at least we get...something
---
All of that is just consolidating /2. LookingForGroup is a global channel in Classic (and even if it wasn't people would just /join world and use that).
---
Autoinviting has existed since Vanilla with oRA.
---
You still have to manually get to the dungeon or get Warlock summoned. This alone is a far higher cost than spamming "LF tank" and will do the same thing that you're trying to accomplish in making people not bail on the first death.

Bringing the player is great, but there's *no* way to vet that someone is actually a good player. At least with a high gear score you'd at least know that even if they're their gear might carry them (but usually not). Gear score sucked, but you at least had a shitter doing slightly more damage than a shitter with terrible gear on top of that.
---
this class shaming is offensive
---
This is just something bad players don't want in the game so they can *weasel* themselves into good groups.
---
&gt;Classic has pretty terrible itemization, and low ilvl gear can be best in slot for a long time.
---
This isn't an issue because they can simply make it work to show the highest gearscore of the items you own (bags/bank).
---
The point many people are trying to make is that you or anyone else should not be dictating how a third party should be playing the game. Someone using addons does not corrupt your or their experience of the game. Everyone is allowed to enjoy the game just as they want, be it with or without addons.
---
What game is that? Diablo 3?
---
ikr lol these posts are fucking retarded
---
Back in my day it was a way to show dominance between siblings and how you would get the other to play with you
---
This is this kind of mentality which will make people not becoming new players. By not allowing this kind of add-on you are hurting the game.
---
someone is going to jail for this
---
Yeah, right clicking a character name and selecting "invite" is what totally makes the gather a group together special. Else it's totally meaningless. /s
---
I will concede this point. It’s hard for me to say that I know one or the other will be more beneficial, so I would tend to err on the side of what was closest to a Vanilla experience.
---
Nochanges, right.
---
If everyone had that mindset, no one would ever do anything good in their life. Without being preachy, if you wanted to start a cake business but you decided not to because ‘someone already did it’ there’d be no new businesses. 
---
That’s my two cents - your view came off as negative.
---
I was playing an alt ret paladin who had just dinged 80 and I was in the process of gearing up in random dungeons. I think I had 4k gearscore, and some jerk hunter with 5.2k gearscore wanted to kick me for being a noob. No one said anything, of course, because LFD. The hunter ended up doing 800 DPS and I can't remember what I did but it was a lot more than that since paladin was my main and I knew how to play.
---
I'm attempting to imagine myself trying to join ZF and some guy playing Classic for the first time wanting to kick my priest for using a level 39 +healing mace and other +healing gear instead of higher ilvl +int gear (or let's be real, any gear that's higher ilvl). All they see is ilvl at that point.
---
I've been cleaning my house and doing chores/errands like a mad man today so come monday I have nothing to worry about but sit back and enjoy the queue times.
---
That's a fair point that I hadn't considered before.

Remember the RP commandments!

Thou shalt not use a lore unfriendly character name

Thou shalt not be a Mary Sue
---
Thou shalt not godmote

Thou shalt not roleplay a prophet predicting or acting out future expansions or events before they actually happen
---
I played all of vanilla and never heard of any of those so its probably not as highly praised as you think.
---
Having used the naga and the corsair scimitar,the scimitar is miles ahead in build quality. I would recommend that over the naga anyday. As for mmo mouse being worth it, I cant imagine going back to playing wow without it.
---
Go cry elsewhere
---
Just tell him that it’s going to be one of the biggest hits of all time and you want to experience it with him, at least a bit. 
---
If you can’t get him to play by evoking brotherly bond, I feel bad for you.
---
Nice thanks! This was one of the first addons I used back in the days.
---
There's good discussion here.  If you don't have anything constructive to add, do not post.
---
I don't think you know what discrimination means
---
I think this addon may make it less likely for many players to make friends, depending on how widespread it’s usage is.
---
This... This will be me
---
But in that Case leveling Time doesn't really matter or does it? Because when you take a 30min walk from UD to Mulgore you will have enough time to skin once you hit lvl 5. Also are you sure that works out? Don't you hit like lvl 5 on the first 2 quest there after so much exploration exp

Being creative isn't just about differentiating yourself. It's also about expressing yourself. Finding something your passionate about and finding new ways to enjoy it. Not everything needs to start out with a business mentality. Sometimes the simple act of being creative helps bring joy to our lives.
---
People will always ask how are you different, but always fail to realize that you need to first build it for others to come. No one starts with millions of viewers and not everyone is going to get a millions of viewers. OP isn't asking us how he can become the next pewdiepie.
---
If they introduce a gear score add on to classic they will just assign #'s to the pieces instead of using the item level. IE low level awesome shoulders have are now 55 points of gear score and shitty epic chest plate of spirit is now 30 points even though the chest plate is higher item level.  
---
I know this changes nothing about how you feel about gear score and I don't particularly care for it either, but classics itemization is not a big challenge to overcome to get an accurate picture of peoples gear power regardless of wonky vanilla itemization in an addon.
---
If you can't manage Aaron try Acorn instead. It's similar and also a pretty good nickname :)
---
Is that Ramadan Steve?
---
That’s only possibly true if it gives the population an advantage. A LFG addon is useless to many players and only provides a mild bonus to QOL to those who, for whatever reason, don’t want to look at chat.

OBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

---
How do you expect to know a random fucking person's value/skill lmao? Your logic is absurd. Yes, shitters can have a high gearscore/ilvl but it's still a better indicator than nothing. Someone with a higher gearscore is statistically more likely to be a better player even if it isn't true 100% of the time.
---
Boo you whore
---
It's a bit alleviated in Classic though since whoever you get as a replacement still has to get to the dungeon, and if you want to summon them you have to get out since you can't summon inside instances. I think mobs respawn after 30 minutes in dungeons as well, but I could be wrong.

Social justice is a cult. You should seek help.

I think that damage meters have their place. If said Jonny wants to raid and doesn't know how to utilize his dps class, he should stick to raiding with a guild that's okay with that, and should avoid plaguing pug groups. 
---
Also, honestly no one ever REALLY gives a shit about DPS meter results in a dungeon unless there are serious problems. I don't think it's even remotely a big enough issue to be concerned enough to consider removing or limiting it in certain types of content.
---
You obviously do not understand the point and since the echo chamber is just going to downvote me to oblivion I see no reason to keep going. The culture this addon will bring coupled with the improvements to it in developement will sever the community aspect of the game and turn it into a similar situation to retail.
---
Thats bull because i go into work at 1 lol rip
---
Famous last words as 3 UD rogues appear
---
I did say something like that he was like I’ll see, and I feel like he is not really interested:(
---
Not one of my friends that plays PC games uses discord, over there are many ppl out there that don't use all those social media platforms , and just use in-game chat , remember many players are 30+
---
Classic is about to diiiie !! REEE
---
As someone that hasn't played classic before it was classic, or retail for that matter. Wont people just make LFG discords and whatever instead? Just one more step but not really preventing the "problem".
---
do you want to know more?
---
Ha, somebody noticed :D
---
Do the “just the tip” method and invite him to make a character at your place, assuming you live close to each other. Don’t put to much pressure on him to commit because he likely views it as a huge time investment. He could end up wanting to go all in on his own after a bit of playing.
---
In vanilla it was an addon and in tbc it was baseline
---
20% is quite optemistic, 40 feels more fair
---
Discord? Lol
---
Hi, /u/Kiragon777
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cua3e4/someone_is_definitely_out_there_just_waiting_to/). 
---
That’s what I thought! Unsure though...
---
Take your time, don't get discouraged quickly, and don't be afraid to ask question that you may think are "stupid". My only MMO experience before starting wow in BC was OSRS. WoW is a completely different game, and the community as a whole has completely different goals and a massive difference in mindset.
---
I've got Dude.
---
"Wanh wanh retail sucks theres no immersion everything is about efficiency, theres no journey, everything is cold with no community"
---
*Use an external website to avoid playing Classic as it was back then to be as efficient as possible, killing the sens of community*
---
We all blame Blizzard for ruining WoW but the closer we get to Classic the more evident it is that the community killed WoW
---
You’ve convinced me to use it. Thanks
---
thank you all for the replies, guess I'll be going Fury))
---
what?! now I can't claim to be a fury warrior while in pvp spec xD
---
By the time I hit 60 in classic, I'll have made 100m atleast from gargoyles.
---
How does it affect people who don't use it?
---
Rip the cluster function in vuhdo
---
I don't see what's wrong with an addon like this. I'm 100% against anything that negatively effects social interaction and community. This doesn't at all. It doesn't automatically form groups and it doesn't teleport you to the dungeon. All it does is take the spam out of trade chat and puts it in a neater UI.
---
You are going to stay up all night playing? 😃
---
I’ve got a 5 hour client workshop on the next day, otherwise I might consider it too!
---
Was there really that many pvp servers back in vanilla compared to pve?
---
Thank you so so much! This is gold ! nice work.
---
I agree with you! Cool.
---
Sure if they want to fuck literally every single chat addon just to make a simple group finder more inconvenient....
---
Even if there was an addon just as powerful (which there wasn't, it didn't have nearly as many features), nobody bothered using it back then which made it irrelevent since these addons only have a point if everyone uses them. Back then you had plenty of people that didn't bother with addons at all. Nowadays with the twitch tool way more people use addons and this would instantly turn into a "Must have" addon. Fuck that.
---
Yes I agree
---
Somewhere on this sub I read that you need a friendly reputation with Orcs/Trolls/Tauren to be able to accept quests from them and that therefore you can't start as an Undead in another zone. Not sure if that's true.
---
Of course not a big deal at all. But thought it was an easy question - seems like more people are unsure 😄
---
not a good look, cops usually roll alliance
---
I used Call-to-Arms in Vanilla, are you saying I wasn't “playing the game properly?”
---
Who the fuck are you?
---
Fuck off, you fucking hypocrite.
---
Yea! Slippery slope! Better put LFR in the game and get rid of talent trees too, it's the **exact same** thing!
---
I think its a nice idea. The video wasn't really my style (would change the music and hide ui for starters) but idea is workable.
---
I would camp you relentlessly.
---
F
---
the game is great though, it is extremely educational to a degree that other games have offered, rarely, but never in such massive scope and intricacy. 
---
I sometimes wonder if u think u do but u don't was a reverse psychology tool that they used to simultaneous increase hype and also take a hype reading.
---
&gt;actual fair fights
---
ha
---
hahahaha!!
---
It did?
---
I dont have the clip handy but ion literslly said that "you dont have to use it" is not good enough because of the damage it does to the community.
---
This is that exact scenario and saying "you don't have to use it" is not valid and gors against blizzards stance.
---
Exactly or how I use to heal all the raids boomkin. Losing vanilla on the legion client a bit.
---
Like Raistlin in Dragonlance.
---
Shaman already has terrible mitigation compared to higher armor classes. Even in that half second you can get hit and most often than not you will be.
---
&gt; The addon allows you to find replacements without leaving the dungeon
---
You could do this in vanilla. There was global LFG. People say this addon is going to make groups more likely to kick because "it's making it so easy to find replacements it's like retail" while ignoring the fact that you're still not going to be kick-happy because it means waiting for someone new to trek their ass out to the dungeon, since there's no port to dungeon, not even the meeting stones could summon in vanilla.
---
dude dont be depressed. use this opportunity to create a damn cool battlestation room!

I think the best thing to do when going duo is one picking skinning and mining / herb the other one picks the gathering profession that is missing and then split the $ between both
---
And nah, exploration isn’t that bad. It least on private servers.
---
You don't have to 'bond' with people if you don't want, but what's important is that most of us don't want to make it easy to just 'get out' as you put it.
---
If a player has spent a decent amount of time forming a party and traveling to an instance, they are for less likely to dodge.
---
bigglesworth is actually good because it's so damn silly.
---
I wouldnt want to live a life like that.
---
I've spent a lot of time in MMOs with instant group finders and I can absolutely confirm this - people tend to leave immediately after the first wipe more often than not.
---
Why bother pushing through when in 2 minutes I can be in a better group without these losers? /s
---
They only speaking about US/EU servers when saying they cant fit people in a queue.
---
&gt;Why use a LFG discord when you have ingame chat at your finger tips?
---
If I'm sitting outside scarlet monastery one member short of a party I could either waste my hearth getting back to a capital city (assuming it's not already on cooldown) to use trade chat, or just tab over to discord and post in the lfg channel.
---
If somebody wants to punch me in the face and steal my car. Whatever, fuck it.
---
&gt; Whats the difference in arguing that classic should be brought back at all, and what version of classic should be played? 
---
Because those facets of the game are shared by everyone, and that's why it warranted discussion to get it right. Addons aren't shared by all. Anyone can create any sort of addon they like as long as it's within the terms of use. Adding onto that, anyone can use however many (or few) addons as they prefer. And unlike the shared aspects of the game, addons do not affect your gameplay at all if you don't wish them to.
---
The more vocal of them are a bit odd with the edgy behavior. I don't get it.
---
Yes, much better. I still have fond memories of random wipers inviting me to party. Stop defending lfg addon. It will kill social interactions.
---
Sexism is an community issue and can be taken care by the community. Actually it doesn't require any work to be done, it just requires the mindset to change.
---
While the community can exert certain pressure on to devs. It can't just change their behaviour, the devs/publishers have to change themselves.
---
The community can change themselves. And it really isn't that hard, all we need it to acknowledge that this is an issue for large enough part, and just stop it.
---
You 100% could. I remember being pissed off because I couldn’t figure out how to stick them back together during vanilla
---
Ah, the classic mirror earth conspiracy theory
---
I think this will be ok.  It makes groups easier. Does it make people more expendable?  For dps, yeah probably, but not tanks and healers.  You're still limited to people on your server of the appropriate level looking to do the dungeon.  It's still a small group.  You're still going to need to make connections.  It's still going to suck if someone ragequits. 
---
It's nothing like what was added in WotLK.  I don't think group finders are inherently bad.  It's cross-realm group finders that are the problem.
---
What automated features are you concerned about that this addon provides?
---
that's a good thing. I think USA has too many servers now. Some are DEFINITELY going to die after a month or so. people don't realize the grind and toil of classic.
---
So you live in San Antonio, but insist on giving times in GMT? I can't imagine why your coworkers think your insane.
---
Those times when you get there and someone has to leave because dinner was ready
---
U gotta fix ur perspective. This is education. Fun is education. The game world is the center Feature. It is a vast experience that requires focus, attentiveness, and studying the boons and dangers while getting to know ur teammates better and better.
---
yeah nah
---
It's just anger inducing to see so many people who have been shitting on retail for years suddenly want to turn Classic into retail
---
Seriously. Classic will be amazing, and the Classic team have done such a good job.
---
I guess I’ll find out 😄
---
Welcome friend.
---
You god damn dumb dumb poop brains face!!!
---
It’s not in the game.
---
Okay boomer
---
If you have a sub, go make a character on a retail Pacific server.  It should be the same, just be aware spell batching will change the "feel"
---
No it doesn't.  Finding people mid dungeon is still a pain in the ass because it means everyone waiting 15+ minutes for someone to make it to the dungeon you're already in.  Kicking people at the drop of a hat didn't even become a thing until Cata because that's when they added the instance teleport.  The thing you're worried about didn't even become a thing with the LFG tool which was introduced in TBC.
---
Yeah, really not hard to mete out dickheads. Rogues and hunters are gonna compete on armor, at a minimum, until 40, wherein mail is opened up. Ranged stuff should preference to hunters, melee to rogues. Really simple stuff. Not hard to see who needs it more, either, and be sensible about loot handling. I imagine it'll take some time to get into that mentality though, especially if anyone (not just a hunter) is coming fresh from retail where loot is abundant and dungeons are quick.
---
You've got me wrong dude, I'm not asking for it to be banned... We all like different things, I'm just saying I wish it wasn't a thing.
---
LOL everyone here taking you serious about monopolizing peaceblooms.
---
Please Blizz, ban this stuff. I won't be downloading it but that won't stop the masses :(
---
&gt; call-out and *report* sexist players
---
Yeah this kind of joke policing that you're advocating for is guaranteed to poison and eventually destroy any community that embraces it. Please keep this toxic garbage to yourself.
---
people act like its going to tp ppl to dungeons 😂
---
Why would you suddenly not want to run dungeons with someone you know to be good and rather find some randoms over them?
---
Spotted the retail player!
---
Fairbanks supposed to be chill ?
---
I’d rather re group with good friendly players I met on LFG addon rather than risk it again to get some “ go go go” player. Not that I agree with the addon itself, but this just feels like people complaining for the sake of finding something to complain about.
---
The correlation they tried to make is that this subreddit has a tendency to find something to be mad about and then spawn a hate circle around it, even if the issue isn't that big of a deal.  
---
See: Skeletons, Joana, ClassicLFG
---
&gt;You are "You dont know what you want" in a person.
---
You and the OP are the only ones in this thread trying to control how other people play the game.
---
How can you not see that you are a complete hypocrite? How do you lack any self-awareness?
---
You need to drop that ego kiddo, you have the attitude of an angsty teenager but you type like you're a miserable middle aged man.
---
I'm pretty certain blizzard CAN stop it, yea?
---
This doesn't change that at all. You still need a tank to actually exist for your instance. You still need to travel to the instance.
---
Do you really hate to be that guy?
---
Fuel me your useless tears.
---
It's Atiesh. As far as any other server that's been named, it's people trolling.
---
just like some affection or something. wow is so much better with a little affection and supporting acceptance, people scarcely realize this
---
It’s more fun to be completely reactive and uninformed though
---
Not a problem! https://imgur.com/oShWRxP
---
I mean that the hunter quest item can drop from begin so they can get their Staff with some effort.
---
I’m sure they will try to sell it for a currency that is actually valuable. Cash.
---
Well you won't see it yourself
---
I'm gonna gank Nannytuesday non-stop
---
Now you're getting it
---
Insightful analysis, thank you.
---
dude they said they're gonna roll out the realms on the 27th. read their latest announcement. christ.
---
ikr layering is 10000x worst than that chat addon 🤣
---
I'd immediately quit my realm and play hogger
---
Technically released before TBC in the 2.0 pre TBC patch.
---
Those fucking troll ears and necklaces quests in STV still haunt me. I grinded almost 3½ levels trying to get all the necklaces.
---
Organized PUG raids will be successful. LF39M MC is going to be miserable for a long, long time.
---
Dude im a gay black guy. If i can handle being called the n word you can handle being told to "get back to the kitchen".
---
That brings up another point. What would anyone even say aside from "go back to the kitchen"? I cant even think of a sexist joke.
---
No it's not lmfao wtf
---
Would you use the actual in-game, blizzard-made LFG user interface that also auto-invites?
---
In games you are not playing with an average player, you are playing with a specific player. So I would advise to rate based on the performance of said player.
---
And the point is not about playing with, it's actually about chatting with/about.
---
If you see someone post "Don't play with abc they are a noob and pull when the healer is out of mana." -&gt; That's not sexist. It might get toxic, but it's not a part of conversation.
---
If you see something like this:
---
"abc is pulling when the healer is oom";
---
"That's cause she is a girl, should go back to the kitchen" &lt;-this it the bad part. It's perfectly valid to criticize someones performance in games, just don't base it on who is sitting on the other side of the monitor.
---
Hell if you want a male only guild it's ok too. The point is to let women who are going to play classic to play in peace from harassment for the fact they are female.
---
So you're in favor of groups self-segregating. Brilliant.  
---
And then you pull this gem of a cop-out: "sorry for not using your preferred pronouns haha" Way to go. Very mature. Don't stay out past your curfew, tyke.
---
Yeah dude.  Fuck these instant gratification zoomers.
---
How long until we get an LFR add-on to appease these BFA babies? I give it a month.
---
everyone who even name it ingame gets on my ignore list
---
Lol fuckin “learnt”!!!! Is that the contraction learned not? 
---
I believe the word you’re looking for is learned.
---
Why does EU get all the badass names
---
How about it starts with you?
---
It's "Voluntary" in that _Nobody_ is forcing _You_ to use it. 
---
if _You_ do not want to use it? Don't. 
---
_You_ do not get to tell _Me_ how to play _My_ game.
---
Same. I stopped playing anything, and Classic launch is the only thing I'm focused on.
---
Yes exactly. If you dont want to have a classic experience then go to private servers
---
Ah.. it was obvious, I'm an idiot
---
I’d love the Fairbanks one.
---
This will be the third time I am "changing" servers already haha. First I told my friends herod when they were first announced, then I switched to stalagg and now I'm planning on incendious. I haven't even subbed yet haha. I just want a server that's pvp and east coast and doesn't have stupid long queue times. I played on burning blade back in vanilla and remember the insane queue times especially on the weekends, really not looking to go down the route again.
---
This is wonderful! 
---
See you guys in 87 hours!
---
As the other poster mentioned, LFG isn't better. It's more 'efficient', that doesn't make it "better".
---
Lmaooo bruh you  gave Reddit wayyy to much credit
---
Good luck , a a ron
---
+1
---
You understand that there's /join LookingForGroup, world channel, in Classic, right?
---
Heh cute...mount trading
---
I must be really lucky to not have had to add anybody to my ignore list over the 12 years I played WoW. My only beefs were with Alliance players and it's not like I could communicate with them anyways ^before ^they ^all ^went ^extinct ^on ^my ^battlegroup.
---
Your droolcup needs emptied.
---
The blizzard LFG tool also auto-invites, the actual non-addon one.
---
Oh, ok
---
They are bind on use but you need exalted to learn the riding skill for other faction mounts.
---
Blaumeaux and Skeram still have space, low and medium, respectively.  So that will be 3.5 PvP servers that need to fill up on launch day.  Yeah, they'll probably need more but Blizz has been very cautious.   
---
I think the launch day crowd will be the ones that will see the high attrition down the line as well, so yeah.  They've pretty much set up these new servers to die by not announcing more for name day and getting the hardcore crowd more spread out.
---
We are all numbers. 
---
People are initially going to see level as a number. They will inspect and use item colour and level as a number.  
---
Eventually people will code add ons which will grade you on how BIS your gear is - as it’s a better way than Ilvl at least initially. 
---
It’s a slope that is unable to be stopped because it’s based on easily visible information that will be tallied. 
---
There will be bots farming information for websites and soon enough you will be ranked.
---
Thanks for your insight. In an ideal world someone would create good, original content AND know how to promote it - I think that’s how people win.
---
Appreciate your comment!
---
Some of my ingame and even RL friends are people I met through pickup-groups that started from a chat conversation. You shouldn’t want to automate this kind of human interaction. It’s short term gain for long term loss.
---
*If it wasn't for you meddlin' kids, I'd be DPSing balls deep inside Scholomance right now!*
---
Yeah I know they're going to. But you're talking about realms being dead and underpopulated. There's nothing to suggest that will happen.
---
Fortunately the change should only take a minute. I will switch to classic.wowhead later today, chose [classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch) initially because classic wowhead wasn't available when I started it
---
Ah I can't wait to see her again, old school style.
---
87 hours!
---
what's more idiotic is a pussy who can't even give reasons why they disagree. if you got something to say, say it instead of contributing jack all.
---
The 58-60 section for orc shaman includes a lot of silithus that won’t be in game p1.
---
Because it's a game and games attract kids and there is nothing more modern kids love more than screeching outrage.
---
Omegacringe reply.
---
Why are u gae?
---
and my [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](/spoiler)
---
you said it backwards
---
yes, the answer is yes, you can get another undead to buy the undead mount for the discounted price and trade it to you
---
If I remember correctly you still needed rep in order to be able to use the mounts.
---
OMG YES
---
5pm Monday night, I'm hyped AF
---
Thanks for the hint, I will fix it
---
&gt;It makes the process of finding new groups or replacements for your groups easier.
---
Oh so we want convenience now?  Go play retail then.  Also, it makes groups LESS likely to stick together because you can easily just go LFG easy as pie instead of having to actually have skin in the game and go back to hub cities and search for a group manually.  You can just churn through members like they don't even matter.  When you actually have to put in effort to FORM the group, the group tends to recognize that and be more likely to try to overcome hardship otherwise you all wasted an hour for no reason.  Your reasoning is backwards.
---
true but rag is not demonic, and doom guard has horns and wings with tail, not whip maybe but balrogs wield giant swords too
---
Does anyone know if they allow rolling on blue+ drops that can never be used? I'm fairly sure it wasn't in Vanilla, but it'd really make sense to allow Greed at most for unuseable gear.
---
Yeah, Call to Arms became before the Blizzard LFG tool in 1.3 and did the exact same thing. It was more or less discontinued since the Blizzard Offical Tool introduced in 1.3 (improved in 1.5 &amp; 1.7) was far superior with things like... Auto-invite.
---
The fun is Adventure. What gameplay does when well made is stimulate the brain, it is literally educational. This type of game mechanic harnesses several tactics that are wired in our brain like repetition, and communication/story.
---
Before you is a series of staircases with 100 steps each.
---
60 of them. At the top of the staircases is some additional non stair shaped structures to ascend through, which cannot be done alone.  
---
The game world presents a massive entity of sorts that encourages and asks of players to get to know its boons / dangers, develop knowledge through practice, and to get to know themselves and each other in the process.  
---
This is education in its true form. That's why adventure gameplay is almost solely the central element of my brand as philosophy/psychonautics and shamanism educator.   
---
Leading up to the classic moment we are now upon, I've spent the year thinking these thoughts, and designing the core of my brand. It occurred to me that every game quest I've ever been on that mattered came down to this- what we are searching for is YOU. We fighting darkness that pushes You in a corner unseen and silenced. We are battling the bosses and enemies to gain the loot and XP. My important friends are the treasure I cleared the dungeon to find, and I intend to battle and defeat whatever bosses stand i my way to make it out of there with them by side.
---
Mounts that you buy from vendors cant even be traded on retail. Raid/dungeons mount will be tradeable
---
I finish my current job today and start my new role on the 9th September so got a couple weeks straight to play! My GF is also going on a short break with her friend back home so got full unadulterated classic playin’
---
If they are then you could do the old trick of making a tauren, buy a mount and send it to yourself in the mail...
---
TLDR- This addon doesn't function the same way that WoW's current "LFG" system works, and we really shouldn't be too worried.
---
&gt; Bring difficulty back to Azeroth please. Make things meaningful again. Let certain people that have earned it stand out with a greater deviation of power compared to the average player. Bring back community by adding some sandbox elements into the game that take place in the open world. The game is far too instanced and narrow now with fast-travel.
---
Do you know which subreddit you are posting in?
---
Omg blizzard can't predict the future and not everything is exactly how I want it :'(  I'm being forced to play a video game against my own will , oh wait it hasn't even been released yet
---
Well actually few people want a toxic community. There is a general idea what's polite and not polite to say, and just don't say the first things.
---
Blizzard has chat checks/filters, and will not ban anyone from saying Kill all Alliance, For The Horde!
---
But saying Kill all female players, they should get back to the kitchen, should be discouraged.
---
Human nature
---
You both got it totally wrong. It's inclusive, every group made in the addon is broadcasted in LFG chat, so people that won't use it will be matched together. It doesn't work like retail LFD/LFR. It just parses chat messages, by using LFG chat you will be joining people using the addon without even notice. It doesn't rempve the interaction, you still need to message people, it just make easier to find the LFM messages.
---
This seems to me at least a bit weird opening 4 new PvP realms at once... I get Shazz and Gole are mega full but still 4? Firemaw stuck at Medium still. I think 4 is to many and at least 2 of these new servers will end up Low population after drop off in 3-4 months. I will be avoiding these 4 realms like the plague
---
Sounds like you need an add-on to filter out what people are looking for in LFG channel!
---
Yeah cross-faction collusion was against ToS in Vanilla (and will be in Classic). They should get banned for that at the very least.
---
&gt;Herod is terrible tbh.
---
It's not, it's anagram of Horde.
---
Rip dead boi
---
I played a p-word server and the beginning stages of having a pet felt like every 10 seconds he'd get unhappy lol
---
That's because you role players are so damn thirsty.  
---
Yes I see you aethym. Dont tell me you dont spend your spare time in Goldshire
---
holy fucking shit blizz is such a shitshow 1st they put up too few servers now they push 5 new servers right before launch ofc they will be dead now that every1 wants to play on the og realms fucking blizz shit company ill enjoy watching this shitshow escelate and lead to death of all but 2 or 3 servers
---
Pretty sure there's 0% chance that they would leave stuff in the addon api that they would ban people for using.
---
Not soon enough, if anything
---
did somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]`?
---
are you kidding me? Blizzard was worried about this from the start. They know that it has a high chance of happening and anyone with a lick of sense knows that classic's nature might be off-putting for some. That's why they only added a few servers at the start. The concern that I have isn't just some unlikely or trivial event. It's a real issue.
---
Probably the fact that your whole post is just wrong. Its so wrong that it looks like your trolling.
---
This is awesome! Thanks for letting me know
---
Disabe it please blizzard, we want the authentic vanilla experience!
---
Layering : 
---
-Good job blizzard , sharding is great!
---
Chat addon to find groups: 
---
-REEEE , go back to retail , classic is DEAD , BAN OR I QUIT!!
---
I wish I could play on a non layering server , but hey gotta complain for a fucking  addon right ?
---
I agree 100%.
---
Yeah, the subreddit that's most likely to relate and agree?
---
I'm actually planning on hitting 60 in 10-12 weeks. With 2-4 hours of playing a day. Let's hope it works out.
---
Yeah, mounts were am item that needed to be carried in your bag
---
yea I stillw want the undead horse, but I won't be honored with the undead to get it cheaper. thanks! Also, do you know if I'd have any troubles leveling an undead in durotar/barrens?
---
The actual Blizzard ingame Looking For Dungeon system introduced in 1.3 auto-invites too.
---
The worst part is that MMORPG games like this never get changed fixed  or get tweaked in any way whatsoever ! :((
---
New character Models ruin this
---
Rule 1, my dude.
---
&gt; Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic. This is not a community for private servers, **current** World of Warcraft, streamer drama, etc
---
Yep same problem.
---
 dont want to wait for Dungeon-Groups: Warrior / Priest / Shaman / Druid
---
But want to play a lot solo pvp (killing, not healing): Hunter/Warlock/Rogue 
---
I dont have much time, so i dont want a slow leveling and super gear dependent char. But i also like beeing the Mainhealer or Maintank, more than beeing one of 30 DPS spamming frostbolts or something.
---
Dont want to respec when going PVP&lt;-&gt;Raid&lt;-&gt;Dungeon.. 
---
Its super hard. Watched so many "which class you should choose" videos.. But it isnt helpful.
---
Earlier in Vanilla i Played Warrior as a Maintank, but getting stomped in PVP (no pocket healer :() -&gt; i rolled priest and became mainhealer but i really liked playing shadow in PVP (lot of respecs :&gt;) and there was no raid spot for shadow -&gt; Then i rolled Warlock. I love playing those char in PVP (Destro) but PVe isnt 100% mine.. (and you have to respec most likely)
---
Right now i prefer hunter for beeing less gear dependend, super fast leveling and for gr8 pvp options. But harder to find groups.
---
I also like characters where i can farm many equipment-sets (tank, heal, DD1 Spec, DD2 Spec), which isnt the case for hunter..
---
Working a 95 hour work week so that I can grind another 95 hours starting Monday
---
Mind me ask what that add-on is about? Never heard of it
---
You talk to them. If they’re shitheads, you’ll notice straight away. It’s not warerproof, but it’s an indication how they formulate themselves.
---
There’s always those dudes who peaked in High School... on WoW
---
Are you implying the social aspect was killed in tbc? I played both and the community was just strong, wotlk with dungeon finder etc is when it started going downhill.
---
Problem with those names is they're *too* cool. They will be insta full
---
whats the end in this case? pvp?
---
So you are saying that you (I don't know who you are really) have better Information on playerbase and realm Population than Blizzard, a Company that has been doing this for over 15 years with shit tons of data on realm Population?
---
They just underestimated the Hype around classic and probably also realized that it is not 95% of People that will quit after a few weeks but more like much less :D
---
Just take a chill pill - if you are worried just take a very populated Server and you will have much less of a Chance that it will feel dead at some point
---
so you used sarcasm to make yourself a retard... ok retard
---
Any class can be a tank if you're brave enough.
---
For addons that does something more yeah, but the blizzard LFG tool in-game in vanilla auto-invited too. I'm actually not sure what this tool does different than the Vanilla Meeting Stones.
---
Esfand is a prophet confirmed
---
This sadly isn't only on Fairbanks. If you haven't already, enable 2FA on all of your accounts, because they will go after you.
---
if Bigglesworth was east coast id be on it in a flash, what a perfect name.
---
Not really. It's just what they like to do in the game. Since Vanilla there has always been people whose Goal was never gearing, it was just "How much money can I make." 
---
They don't care about spending it, they care about owning it and having it
---
Biggiesworth it is then
---
I concede I'm wrong about the combat log split.
---
PvP has come a long way since then, I'm glad addons became a thing if this is what the average player would be playing like without them. I hardly consider this a PvP video because he could be versus mobs and they would be putting up a better fight.
---
yessss keep them out of our server. Keep it MEDIUUUMM
---
No players found.
---
Blizzard announced 4 more PvP servers :)))))))) LMAO... I am literally dying of laughter at you right now :D I love these kind of people " and you look like an idiot "
---
It's not like retail LFD/LFR, it's the same as old addon we had in Vanilla, CallToArms, it just parse chat messages so you better see how is looking for members, you still have to talk with the people. As it was back then. #NoChanges
---
You inspired me to start a guild on day one named ”Warrior Priest”
---
The automation thing is also simply the same thing used in macros, InviteUnit() function... they should remove that and i it would change very little, i also do not think most people would have that enabled since it would make for some very funky group comps..  
---
Also i was not very clear in my first comment that it was a hypothetical, so my bad there.
---
&gt; Develop an addon that will combat the LFG addon in a effective way.
---
Step 1: Install Classic WoW
---
Step 2: Don't Install any addons you don't want
---
Step 3: Play game
---
Step 4: Stop making these posts
---
I think Blizzard did this time.
---
I bought ALOT of 5 hour energy. Enough to hit close to 60 anyway :D
---
My ninja. . .
---
Cunning tactic from Blizzard.  Give the final wave of servers much cooler names than the existing ones to encourage people to switch last minute.
---
What do you base your info on?  There are a lot of mistakes, especially for the frost mages bis list, I didnt even check more classes after noticing that
---
OSRS also conditions you to actually accept grinding, whereas in retail it's very much pushing you onwards to the next thing and you're rewarded before you ever really get bored of it.
---
Well played that some also with friends later but wasn't the main game for me since I found lol at the start before it got known.
---
I started playing it before the first new champion was released
---
There is always a chance they would do it. That is why they write kn the tos that they are allowed to.
---
Some add-ons have been banned and creators threatened before. Granted it was because they tried to sell the add-ons. But regardless, blizz can do what they want.
---
Careful. Make sure to drink water when using supplements
---
2 things can be shit at the same time btw.
---
Looks like OP took it in a different direction, [so I had a go myself :D](https://i.imgur.com/dy1OlqB.png) Inspiration was [this.](https://busites_www.s3.amazonaws.com/acdccom/content/articles/acdc-back-in-black-album-cover-650.jpg)
---
I tried including an actual picture of Arugal but it ruined the feel of the design. Might work better with one of their other albums, happy to give /u/Kithkinz my working file to play with as they obviously have more talent than me!
---
Yeah, in vanilla it was common for me to run the same dungeon at least 5-10 times before moving on to the next, if you need then roll need and if you didn't get it then try again next run. I recall butting heads against other classes from time to time but it wasn't such a big deal in my experience. I also kinda took my time through the game though, speed leveling really sucks. I stopped playing near the end of BC so I don't have any idea what people are used to these days when it comes to loot and dungeons, its going to be interesting to share this space with those with a different WoW background.
---
They read LFG and are instantly triggered.
---
A warrior regard at me for need rolling in a Halbert of Smiting on my hunter.  So I challanged him to a duel outside ZG.  No pets and no ranged weapon.  I kicked his ass with the weapon I out rolled him on and he never brought it up again.
---
I feel ya, some of my friends are rolling horde / Herod. A huge part of me just wants to stray away and pick a new server and class like alliance rogue instead of the plan I was running with before hand which was orc hunter.
---
can you just let people do what the fuck they want?
---
I meant for when twinks were separated into their own queue more recently in retail.
---
I am pretty sure those 10k ques on the original first servers will just decide to disperse on the new realms because ain't nobody got time for that.
---
Clear no from me. And I doubt anyone in my guild would use it.
---
Be careful, caffeine is no joke.
---
Twinking 49is the prime level, classes are pretty much all fleshed out by then (plate and mounts) with more variety in builds with more talent points.
---
Why 🤷
---
Yes, this should definately be the next thing for the subreddit to bitch and moan about once they're done with LFG addons. 
---
Let's think what circle jerks have we seen so far this week?
---
* AQ materials #onechange
---
* Not enough servers #wetoldyoublizz
---
* Layering can't be turned off too many people #okayitcanbedone
---
* Skeletons not accurate #turnsoutitisaccurate
---
* LFG add-on #betterthanawebsite
---
I'm sure I missed one or two....
---
These addons have been on private servers for years. But they're not widely used or a "must have". There is nothing to worry about
---
Where are you seeing this? The [curseforge page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg) doesn't show anything to do with inspecting talents and specifically says it cannot auto-matchmake groups.
---
Neither is meth
---
they are on the wrong side on this war
---
Because it's not like retail dungeon finder, it's like Vanilla old addon CallToArms that we had back then. We keep it because #NoChanges
---
Just sneak in the melee and start hamstring spamming!
---
It's definitely someone's DnD campaign set in Westfall.
---
3 for americans 4 for EU. Suck it, euros!
---
But it does. It auto invites and auto accepts invites too. The only plus side compared to retail is it's not cross realm.
---
That was in TBC, maaaaybe the last couple patches of vanilla. The meeting stones got added earlier, but they were only used to summon the rest of the party with 2 people clicking them
---
I'm pretty sure that was a thing in vanilla too... just be cautious.
---
/r/classicwow: "Classic is about Community, making friends and working with those friends for a common goal."
---
This Mafia: "Our common goal is having 100% Control of the gold on the server, we will do it as a community of friends working together."
---
/r/CLassicwow: "Wait no, MY kind of community. Not your kind. Your kind ruins peoples gaming experience. My community focuses on ganking X-roads 24/7 that's just fun!"
---
Old Blanchy is 100% where my alliance characters will be living.
---
I'd rather recommend you go 30/21/0 then. 31 points in prot mostly gets you holy shield, 1h spec and reckoning. None of those talents do much for aoe farming. The 10 extra points in holy will help your healing ability a lot.
---
A true aoe farming spec would be 11/23/17 though.
---
Statwise, you need zero strength, your primary dmg stat as a prot pala is Spelldmg. HP also aren't that important, you want high block chance and avoidance to prevent dmg.
---
You know you can sort items on the AH by Price Lowest &gt; Highest, right?
---
Because the language question only asks what language you will mainly use, which for many people will be English, even though we're not English.
---
I think we're forgetting that  each realm holds more players than before, I remember reading that medium pop server is the classic equivalent of having a fully populated realm back then
---
It's good to have a lot of people but too many could potentially ruin the game for others, mob tagging will be insane unless you're a caster/hunter
---
Won't be so funny for you when tens of biggest guilds blacklist you for using that addon.
---
those 650's deserve a headphone stand.
---
&gt; With so many people trying out classic, we don't need to bring that garbage from retail into our classic wow community. If people want to farm gold, they need to do it the honest way... by buying every listing and marking it up to a higher, but still reasonable price. And then buying out people's auctions who list it at a lower price so we still have the lowest price, like we all had to do in the before times. That's the Azeroth way!
---
So you want people to play the auction house, but at a price you can afford?
---
I can't think of something MORE vanilla than a guild taking over a server's economy.
---
Just don't use it 4Head
---
It's just a DnD campaign.
---
Fine make a website. Blizzard can't do anything about that. And a website will never be as popular as an in game add on.
---
NickyQ PogCena
---
It doesn't matchmake and the talent thing will be removed. Great alarmist post!!
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/memoria
---
I mean I’m doing the fuck what I want by voicing out so unless your a huge hypocrite I suggest u calm down sir.
---
Any Greeks here?? Which server are you going for?
---
Well i can't remember but up to double price from what you buy will sell.
---
Me as. Tauren horde would love to get hands on all the different owls and mostly the white one I guess
---
It does auto join, sends automatic invites and accepts automatically too. mrGM has a video of it working. The only benefit over live is it's not cross faction. It still kills any human interaction.
---
Rofl Old Blanchy is the most PvE name ever. They outdid themselves on this one.
---
The majority of ppl prefer pvp, like 80% of playerbase
---
yeah , we are month to month , so we are borked , it happens
---
No one is forcing anyone.
---
But claiming one way is the best way for all cases is just simply false.
---
A dungeon finder tool for more than simply a list of groups avaliable, is detrimental to the vanilla/classic experience.
---
Simply not having it in the game will be enough. Vast majority of people do not want to leave the game to do stuff.
---
Old Blanchy is an important character.
---
They were not prepared.
---
Awesome!! Thanks so much!
---
You might not have seen this, but BGs aren't available in the first periods of Wow Classic. WSG and AV comes out in Phase 3 while AB isn't out until phase 4.
---
Since there is layering I won't commit too much, I will idle along assuming I will quit after a few months at most. See no point in playing retail on a different patch.
---
if you ignore everybody that will use the addon you wont find a group at the end unlucky for ya
---
You can't stop it.
---
i knew you would say that
---
You don't get replacement in 5 seconds ready to go. I think it will be finem
---
Why not cocaine
---
As a warrior: I wont.
---
I have the freedom to get what I want when I tank, so should they.
---
I would be OK with an add-on that was more like a bulletin board that you could put you name down on for example ""Level 19 Shaman DPS/Healer looking to do WC"" And if someone wanted you in group they would have to whisper you and communicate. NO AUTO JOIN.
---
why the fuck is this marked NSFW
---
Are you daft? First off, nobody plays SL in organized PvP - you hit like a wet noodle and all your DoTs get dispelled. Secondly, have you ever heard of NF/Conflag? Compared to your beloved SM/Ruin, this destro spec sacrifices 10% shadow dmg for a hard hitting instant spell.
---
Playing destro doesn't mean that you just try to spam Shadowbolt, but you wouldn't know that - after all, rank 10 is fairly casual.
---
im also from  future. the lfg addon killed classic pretty quick. most people left. only few people in city with thunderfury and atiesh. jerking off
---
life starts within
---
They're trying to gatekeep classic into their vanilla experience.  Unfortunately they're in for a bit of a surprise.
---
dude...
---
Lol, don’t die though
---
Imagine getting hit by a car, you wake up in the hospital on launch, you lost all wow related memory and you get to experience vanilla again on your computer 24/24 while staying at the hospital for a few week.
---
If everyone refuses to buy gold and leveling services they would leave unfortunately enough people purchase gold that its profitable.
---
Amazing publicity for this addon
---
a friend of mine said the Deviat Supreme is incredible but everyone got their own taste!
---
But you should try it!
---
Gonna prepare my food in advance :)
---
It is criminal that this is sitting at 312 upvotes and not #1 on /r/all.
---
True, I forgot that
---
I might make a few desserts in advance and maybe a few recipes :D and you know what you are preparing?
---
&gt; Is there anything you guys wish you knew when you first started playing the game at the original release?
---
Not really, it was fun to learn things by playing with friends or diving into it blind.
---
That being said, I'd recommend to make good habits early on such as binding your abilities to key presses and not clicking them with your mouse cursor. It's a first mistake for anyone who may have never played before.
---
Additionally, mouse movement and movement in general is really nice to understand. Holding down both mouse buttons (right and left click) will make your character run in the same was "W" does. While casting, you can hold right click and turn your character's orientation quickly, etc.
---
Hope you enjoy the game if you decide to play!
---
Quest items you don't need to raid for (would need to be kept minimal maybe 1-2 on average per class) would be sick IMO.
---
&gt;you don't want to end up on a dead server. 
---
There will be ZERO dead servers.
---
People will move during launch week when they see they have to sit in 8 hour queues and don't get to play the game.
---
oof
---
never auctelly thought of that.. imagine standing in goldshire inn for 15 years seeing all the shitshow
---
nope
---
Only 10? Don't underestimate us.
---
That gave me a good chuckle.
---
As an actual response to both yours and ReforgedRoyale's comments though, if they removed the addon-to-addon communication it has would you feel differently about it? 
---
That part is the absolute biggest issue for me since it does remove the effort of having to run back to a capital to form a group. With the addon just serving as a text parser however, the point of sticking together and such will still be the same because the frustration of having to run back to a city to get members is still there, just having to copy-paste a message every 5 minutes is the job of the addon and not you.
---
Came here to make this post. OP needs to see how fucking ridiculous their post looks.
---
One example I saw on retail was 10 or so listings by a couple people for a Blacksmith Hammer... For 600g each.  Good for them for having such an ambitious strategy.  I just don't want to see the AH ruined because that's where all gold spammers have been forced to go due to new anti-spam tech.  It's fixing one problem but just dumping it somewhere else.  The AH always had scammers but I don't recall it being such an extensive problem.
---
It's like, sure I don't get gold spam whispers anymore, but now the AH sucks.  It's not the end of the world or anything.  Just something to think about.
---
What about rogues?
---
This is starting to remind me of classic. They carefully planned server resources for the first year and when the game become a huge hit they were like it "fuck it, put them all online, now!".
---
I love both games. Playing island living to kill the time till classic.
---
Hey! You wanna join my guild!?
---
The mafia will have enough people to control Un'goro 24/7 for devilsaur, or other zones for other resources such as Black lotus, on pserver the mafia was a big group of people from both Alliance and Horde working together, they kill everyone trying to take the resources.
---
Nope! It has invite/auto invite buttons. No communication required.
---
They better make a new episode about classic.
---
Better fuckin hope so lol
---
I don't see how this affects most players. You can sort by price, so the extraordinarily priced items are at the bottom anyway. 
---
Then, if you go to the AH, you look for something specific most of the time, which means you enter it into the searchbox and can easily identify a scam listing.
---
So, it would only be really relevant, if you scan the AH unfiltered and would consider buying quite expensive items, which are matched up with those scam listings. At which point you can then also search specifically search for that item to eliminate any risk of scam items on the result list.
---
If only bigglesworth was oceanic, I'd switch to it in an instant.
---
So what you’re saying is person without addon can join just fine without being effected... because to them they join in “classic” way through chat?
---
I feel like every one of these threads people change their minds based on one single minor nuance about the class / race they intended to roll. Every single class has them. If you arent super hardcore going for world first, these nuances don't matter at all. If you were going super hardcore then you would already know it now and be in a guild already and your class /race would be chosen for you. Sure prot paladins are not the best single target raid boss tank in the game but they are still great for 5 mans and can still off tank some raids etc. You might have to heal the majority of raids at least at the start but again, how much time do you plan to raid? Are you going for world first? Overall paladins are def not as good as warriors at tanking but they bring other utility. Prot paladins are also pretty cool to level as you get some decent aoe grinding.
---
Actually the enemy castbar APIs are gone. Any castbar addon you see for Classic is GUESSING based on information written to the combat log. This can be very unreliable, for example it won't know if an enemy's spell's cast time has been improved by talents or not. If you're fighting two mobs with the same name it can't tell which one is casting.
---
MM.. fuck yeah
---
Well there’s 2 pacific coast pvp servers. Whitemane is full, Fairbanks isn’t.
---
The title comes with TBC right? I think the last part not doable in Classic.
---
 I played vanilla both in a hc guild back in vanilla and on private servers - and  when I was playing on private servers everyone and their mom was on the lfg channel, which was just spammed to hell and was very hard to read through, same will happen here, it's the same thing rather than have to look through spammed channel and get eye bleeds, you still have to run to the instance
---
Ppl rly need to stop QQ about this honestly
---
I hit 60 late in vanilla, and wound up only scratching the surface on raid content for exactly this reason - finding dungeon groups was frickin *hard* man, made pre-raid gearing a nightmare. I don't like the idea of compromising on the community aspect of vanilla but insofar as this stiff will get ported out to server discords anyway, you're probably not wrong.
---
Can we add the new servers to this poll?
---
I’m 99% sure I’m staying Stalagg, it was already enough stress moving there from Herod lol
---
&gt;This makes the likelihood for groups to stick together to overcome a challenge instead of disbanding or kicking an underperforming memb
---
Ah fuck I read this wrong.  I was wondering mid post why your comment seemed odd lol.  Oh well, my point still stands!  Fuck LFG and convenience :)
---
One thing I learned the hard way was you don't need to spec for a certain role while leveling. If you want to tank or heal don't bother setting your talents up as a tank or healer until 60. Set your talents up for the best leveling experience until 60 then spec for your role.
---
I.e. If you're a warrior. Just spec fury/arms until 60. If you want to tank in a dungeon just equip a shield, learn tsunder armor, and taunt for dungeon tanking.
---
You don't need rep to use your own races mount.
---
But they say they have no PvE or PvP goals. I'm sure some of the people involved think they can buy their way to BIS gear just to have BIS gear. But many are probably just in it to watch their e-peen grow with their stacks of gold
---
I am fucking kidding around
---
I mean some people are lazy and will pay to buy a Blacksmith Hammer for 600g on retail. Not many will, but you might have a few who don't care and have sent lots of gold to their alts.
---
I think you have the wrong perspective of retail. I recently quick a few months ago and had something like 4 million gold on my main and had spent something like 15 million gold over the course of BFA. 600g is a mere drop in the bucket for some.
---
Players: We refuse to move to new servers since the decision was already taken.
---
Blizzard: Lets open 4 more servers.
---
Exactly.  And since they can't do that anymore, they got pushed into more heavily tricking people in the AH with bogus listings since it's a viable way to earn easy gold.
---
well with the phase release system we will most likely see a
---
peacemaker into spinal
---
At least it ups your melee\_dive dps by a flat 40 over peacemaker for an AiS rotation (not counting 4:3 where its even more impactful as rhok clips way too much on the old AiS rotation.)
---
Interesting 🤔 thanks
---
The general discussion forums are so fucking funny. Everyone on there is in such denial about what Classic will do to retail. They think it'll be nothing and that retail will have 10x the players. It's honestly enjoyable as fuck to read their comments.
---
which trinket is that, might use that to my advantage
---
I'm looking to meal prep too. Any ideas?
---
Pre 60 they can actually dish out a surprising amount of damage, if specced correctly. They just fall off in Endgame because they scale badly with equipment. Pretty much the only things that scale with weapon damage are seal of command and white hits.
---
If you find yourself padding videos with flashy animations and thinking of clever titles to lure people in, you're doing it wrong.
---
Machinima was the best type of content during Vanilla, and it will always be. I vote Machinima!
---
Can't wait for another shitty raid-dungeon-score addon to gate people from content.
---
That's what the current addon is supposed to be about...
---
Up! This needs more visability (mods?).
---
Joke dude ...
---
I don't think breaking the addon will work because of the need for the mechanisms in other addons that are helpful.  It really sucks, but it is what it is.  The best we can do is just hope the community fights against it and doesn't use it, so no one will have a reason to install it.
---
Hard to say since we don't know  
---
- The actual amount of players  
---
- How many people will quit early  
---
- How many more servers they're going to be opening in the near future  
---
I believe no PvP server is going to be truly dead but it's almost guaranteed that some servers like Herod and Shazzrah will be overcrowded now, something that could have been avoided earlier.
---
The goal is likely PVP griefing without having to put the effort into earning gear.
---
At least it was before Cataclysm fucked everything up...
---
I want to speak to your parents, right now.
---
They officially made TSM compatible with Classic, but you'll still need auctioneer to scan the auction house data since TSM desktop is not compatible with Classic.
---
r/FMABrotherhood If you're going to try to be clever it helps when if get the details right.
---
With blues or heck in some extreme cases even greens outperforming epics in Classic I don't think gearscore would work anyways. Yay for wacky itemization?
---
lmao
---
ah the poor gnomes. think they are so clever. i'm beyond luck for you. i have more compassion for you poor shorties. i only kill you if i get really, really lucky with my windfury procs. - Every enhancer shaman ever
---
Yeah, that was a brainfart on my part. Good point.
---
I mean what class.
---
Ahh. I guess that works too lol
---
As it stands, gole and shazz are at unplayable levels of high pop. As in, most people won't be able to even log in and play. Purpose of the new ones along with raised character cap is to relieve those realms. I will be moving to Mograine because i care about playing the game more than being on the most populated realm
---
Dont click spells, use keybinds. type /1 to talk in general chat /p to talk in party chat when in a group and /s to talk in say. Turn on instant quest text in the interface menu. Besides that id go in blind.
---
Imho I think you will be able to pug mc with 15 to 20 people in just a few weeks. I remember raiding with potatos where 2 man did 25% of the whole raid dps and we still cleared mc very easily.
---
Every server will have its more casual players and the most hardcore are often the most vocal or apparent, but definitely play where you think you'll enjoy it the most :) Join us on Gehennas if you're Horde ;)
---
I'd look for him in game and kill him for sure
---
not sure about 420 hours
---
Man how amped up and serious all this petty purist bullshit is getting is reminding me why the super hardcore guys got shit on so much for being the kind of nerds that were fucking exhausting to hang with
---
Everyone will play in 3 days and 14 hours. Relax man, finally all of us will be at home :)
---
It also doesn't work. Two rogues can easily disrupt them and steal their kills. They don't generally run huge groups and they are having to lock down large areas, quickly pop out sap the skinner and skin, it generally works.
---
Exactly 2 new servers i can totally get behind for those that have not subbed yet and over flow but 4 is going to leave these under populated i think
---
the problem is all of my friends and community from large forums are going to play on Ru realms.
---
Everybody's got a problem with someone. Just play the game.
---
This is why we have transmog on retail. I always wear TBC sets on my warrior.
---
&gt; So here's how it should have been done: 
---
Lemme stop you there and just point out that while Blizzard isn't perfect, they are still a large company that is a part of a 7.5 billion dollar a year revenue stream.
---
That being said, they didn't "only now" realize "how bad an idea 2 EU PvP servers" were.
---
Eh it's ok it seems these last few days of waiting are really taking it out of people there's just toxicity spewing all over the place , probably not his fault
---
Lmaooo
---
Mograine will be full 19:02, don't worry about it
---
I'm in the same situation to an extent - my gf tolerates my gaming and has become more understanding as I exposure to more games. She was just never introduced to games and doesnt experience games like I do. Shes come far from thinking every game is nothing more than a skinner box.
---
Klart att man spelar med danskar och norrmän. Något av de roligaste är att spela med en full dansk när du själv försöker tanka. Samt att danskarna och norrmännen jag spelat med alltid varit jävligt omtänksamma.
---
&gt;It doesn't matchmake 
---
Then what do you call an addon that automatically creates the group for the group leader after he puts himself in queue?
---
&gt;and the talent thing will be removed.
---
lol is that what you think?
---
The risk of dead servers would have been higher with more servers at the start.
---
Easier to split population than to merge for blizzard (in their eyes).
---
I just don't want to see 5 hour queues on every single high/full server for more than a week.
---
Just the thought of running Gnomeregan over and over again gives me a headache. So glad i decided against druid.
---
Rogues aren’t competing for plate...
---
thx, my mistake
---
I have trouble deciding class, and now so many server options..... 
---
Life problems...
---
Watch out for alle the lamos being all "be careful with caffeine, remember to stretch and exercise and eat healthy bla bla bla". Take a chill pill jeez.
---
I hope that guilds on Gole and Shazz do the same so these 4 new servers are at least populated in 3-4 months. Blizzard really should of done this 2 weeks ago
---
Really love the detail in the leveling gear! By far my favorite piece of art posted here
---
&gt;The fact that they didn't do it this way either indicates that they misjudged the situation completely or wanted to make some easy $$$ from people paying a sub just to reserve a name.
---
A company wanting money isn't a bad thing. Money is what brought us the game to begin with. They did everything as well as they could. They are adding more servers based on demand.
---
&gt; PoE could really use some kind of auction house.
---
Having an auction house would be counter-productive for the game in a lot of ways. Read the manifest by the devs about it if you haven't.
---
RP snobs? On the pure-RP server?? Heavens, no!
---
I'm tired of this sub bitching about everything, especially things they don't even bother to udnerstand yet already want it shut down.
---
Imagine a list of groups filtered by dungeons, Let's say you're a healer, you see a group with 1 tank and 3 DPS, you sign up, they invite you. Now your group is ready and do the thing. 
---
It skips the part where you're spamming in OG for 30 minutes looking for a group.
---
If spamming "HEALER LFG WC" for half an hour is the peak human interaction some people play classic for then idk what to say.
---
I did play in vanilla.
---
The add-on exists because current players might not want to do that.
---
But that is irrelevant to the point.
---
It is not a better tool for the purpose of classic where player engagement and community is the most central pillar.
---
Having auto whisper, auto invite etc ruins any and all  player engagement and is just the same as retail dungeon finder. With the exception of teleporting to the dungeon.
---
And arguably the worst part is how it reduces the importance of sticking with a group.  
---
In vanilla, most people made friends in groups that they formed and overcame obstacles with together, either in Dungeons or when questing.  
---
This tool will invalidate that aspect by making it that much easier to just replace someone without consequences. The hurdle that was making a party lead to a better community.
---
And as for external tools. There were a couple even back kn vanilla. Irc was very popular on my realm, with our realm server having around 700 during peak. But that was mostly for talking shit. For finding groups it was in game lfg and using your network of friends in game.
---
Most people try and will avoid external tools as they don't want to leave the game.
---
FYI there's a going lfg so you already don't need to leave the dungeon to find someone.
---
Not that this is an excuse for the rest of it.
---
You haven't seen how many of the newer generations of websites work I guess.  Lots of them work very well. 
---
If there is no way in game to find groups other than spamming the lfg channel, which is worldwide and will likely have thousands of people spaming it at the same time, then people absolutely will gravitate to things that actually work. 
---
Would people rather spend 5 minutes on a website or 2 hours spamming a chat channel because addons that make it usable have been disabled or banned.
---
You don't use them all at the same time, with shared cds and/or inability to stack multiple types, most are situational - specially in PVP.
---
Okay, fair enough. Hunter still does only part of his damage with melee then though, while a warrior does all of his damage with the weapon.. I'm curious what % of hunter's damage is melee and how well does it scale with the melee weapon compared to warrior.
---
The real devilsaur 1 man mafia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VpUf9e8uuc
---
If it did end up being a popular addon, it would fuck up the game for people who dont use it.
---
Basically if a person doesn't use it, it would possibly double the amount of time it would normally take to make a group since all the people with the addons wouldn't be using the ingame chat channels.
---
Stalagg looks like he smells funny.
---
This is actually the best place in game to gank people for me.
---
On my rogue, via wall jumping I would get on top of the cave entrance.
---
Wait for a group to start the waves.
---
Let the mage arcane explode the dungeon looking for rogues (lol)
---
Let them clear the first wave.
---
More arcane explosions, this guy is paranoid for some reason.
---
Let them clear second wave.
---
Only one more arcane explosion at the entrance : he has his eye on the prize now.
---
The move just out of the cave to engage the third wave.
---
I drop down, almost on top of the healer,right as they engage the third wave.
---
Burst down the healer before he knows what's happening, vanish sprint out.
---
Watch them decide whether to chase me or try to finish the quest. By the time they decided, I'm gone and the tank is dead.
---
They whipe, and start running back from bb gy.
---
I wall jump back to the top of the cave entrance and watch them grind for a sinew again, while a new episode of the Simpsons begins.
---
Life is good... 
---
For me...
---
In my eyes it's in the spirit of classic, especially on the things I wished I could do back then. Dual is my cup of tea as of now, perhaps a Rogue/Druid duo stealthing around at first and then the druid tanking... damn I might need another Druid to heal :P
---
Yeah i know, there are a few more choices out there. :)
---
The Greater Magic Wand is better than the ones you get from the level 10-20 quests so i chose to not include those to keep the list tidy. 
---
Gravestone scepter is a powerhouse early on, every caster should get their hands on it asap!
---
I’d say we brigade the maker of such a shitty pleb addon. And have Blizzard ban them too.
---
I wish Orc furries were real.
---
Yeah but somebody has to kill these menacing beasts.
---
HE DOES SMELL FUNNY HES A FOOKIN ZAMBIE
---
Because it's a human and not a robot reply?
---
day of the dead is October 31 bro
---
Won't work on PvE servers though. They can't gank people away from the spawns on those.
---
Rakdos *is* a sweet name, though!
---
They aren't saying it's exactly the same as retail but it's a big step forward, it's not the same as manually finding someone because it lists the persons spec/build and potentially other information you usually can't see ingame. You're the one being dishonest here by saying all it does it remove the chat spam.
---
His KOTOR soundtrack is burned into my brain
---
..yes. The Dire Maul two-handed sword.
---
I disagree. If you don’t like that aspect of classic then go play retail, it’s that simple. Classic is meant to be played the way it was back then, whatever that entails.
---
I just want a guide for my professions, I know how tedious it can be but if anyone has any suggestions on how to tackle them efficiently without a guide. I’m open ears
---
Does anyone know the difference in latency between EST and PST servers for those of us in Toronto/Ontario?
---
its much more fun playing with the under represented. Great pvp all day , every day
---
Um, limiting screen time prevents obsessive gaming, which happens quite easily in children. I don’t give a shit about studies, as a parent, I agree with OP, and think a healthy balance between gaming and physically activity is only a *good* thing.
---
I actually found it easier to organize groups in chat. Sure you had to find the people, but they were people. They weren't just silent pseudo-bots, you could actually talk to them and organize and change tactics. Now it's like talking to a wall. No response and no change in behavior. Something goes wrong and a silent kick poll goes through or people just quit. 
---
I honestly lost any fun for dungeons since they added LFG.
---
You should be able to do so. Russian, German, French and English Realms are all considered as "EU-Region" in the server selection.
---
I'm worried queues on Skalagg will be just as long now too :(.
---
If you're a big guild you're not going to wait until the game is out to choose which server you'll be rolling on. That has to be decided multiple days earlier.
---
why are people so deadset on not using ingame chat channels though? There's a LFG channel and a World channel which are both perfect.
---
#noedits?
---
That’s the attitude!
---
Don't forget chuck norris jokes
---
*sips* kids these days just arent funny anymore
---
What does the Z mean?
---
Thanks for the heads up, although I am not sure I'm going for a 5 team a duo or trio isn't out of the question!
---
I will look up on ISBoxer
---
Titanpanel
---
It's from the cutscene in the picture
---
Exactly lol, which is why I'm not worried. From my research, these mafias started on pservers, where economies are unregulated.
---
Blizzard has TONS more ways to regulate servers than how they did back in 05; to think otherwise is ridiculous. The moment they catch notice of something like this going on in highpop servers, ban hammers will be quick to drop. I have high hopes of Blizzard taking the stand to gold sellers/buyers this time around, they seem serious about it.
---
Otherwise if it does become an actual thing, I'll be looking forward to griefing these farmers and stealing skinning/herb nodes like its my job.
---
about the grand exchange though it kinda feels like it killed the world. everyone hangs out in the ge on every single world its the central hub.  before people would have their own favorite spots and 'home' banks etc
---
Agree, good point. Added to the next update
---
Ehh, whatever.
---
I feel it's just not fun and a bit too try-hard. Why play a multiplayer game if you're just gonna play by yourself?
---
We're playing classic to get away from garbage like LFG. So some dumbass decides to bring it to classic as an addon? Fuck off dude.
---
No to group finder
---
i dont understand why you're stressing over this.  if your guild has already chosen a server who cares if they add more.
---
This addon wont change much imo, actually seems a bit redundant tbh. Its essentially the same thing as a world chat channel or server discord. As for the people complaining about a macro that advertises your group every 5 minutes lol.. this is something you can do ingame without the addon. Why is it so important that ppl click CTRL + V instead to advertise their groups?
---
She is, yes.
---
Lmaoooo
---
Herod smells like rich mahogany and is a muscular alphamale.  Stalagg smells gross and he can't even stand up straight.  I think my point has been made here.
---
Does anyone know if the servers will pop up while the window is open in game or will I need to restart the client?
---
Sounds like it could be a real headache.
---
Hi, /u/Naelekk
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuaswv/everybodys_nightmares_after_a_week_of_classic/). 
---
As much as going on your own adventure is fun, missing on the level 10 quest from your Rogue Trainer which gives that green dagger is horrible. I left Kharanos at level 9, so if I wouldn't have asked a random other rogue who had it, I would have never gotten it.
---
I think I will use a quest addon just for not missing valuable quests.
---
You're not going to let an add-on auto invite random shitters to your Scholomance run
---
yeah ... most warranties are scam
---
Haha, was thinking the exact same thing! So damn annoying :D STAND STILL BRO!
---
I'll be leveling a Nelf druid just because of the faerie dragon pet reward on Feralas.
---
bro 😎💪
---
On launch day it will most definitely be medium or higher. My guild swapped to it from Whitemane.
---
Anything above 12k online  simultaneously  on one realm is too much for one layer. 5-10k is optimal. Vanilla servers had like 2,5k cap. I am hoping cap will be like 10k or someting with one layer after p2 hits.
---
ok thanks for letting me know ill have to remember maybe adding an extra ) or look up proper editing links for reddit.
---
I dont entirely agree with you, because strength gives more damage blocked by shield. I have tested out the build with All "Return on hit dmg" items and it was quite beasty. I took on hit-item&gt;block&gt;strength&gt;sp, it was actually really good and I could practically pull 15 mobs and have them kill themselves.
---
The holy shield is a huge factor for your defensive side of the situation, together with your reckoning, which procs with Redoubt.
---
I will take a look at that 11/21/17 tho 👍🏻
---
Blizzard will remove it, they said they will remove any addon that goes against the philosophy of Classic WoW. Its incredibly pathetic and edgy to be that guy who tries to bring LFG to classic.
---
Obviously physical activity is important.  Not sure what obsessive gaming even means, playing a lot of games?  whats wrong with that if all other requirements are being met?
---
I see our antipropaganda campaign is in full effect. Perfect.
---
Face it, classic wow is all there is. No life starts soon, can't wait! 😊
---
Fecking magic
---
Oh, I'm not brave enough for politics!
---
Best autocorrect I've seen on this sub  [😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)
---
Ah thanks. Don't think that changes anything about what I posted.
---
ah yes package deals, every recruiter's favorite deal!
---
addons exactly like this existed in vanilla. 
---
The arguments against it are pro #changes, and showcases of ignorance and poor logic.
---
It doesn't matter if you think the addon will be useful or not, I don't really think it will be... after all, they existed in vanilla and almost no one used them.  
---
That doesn't mean the same simple minded #nochnges zealots who crusaded against ideas like maybe making literally unplayable specs like Balance drood and prot palies better can now turn around and try facist bullshit of "well we still don't want anyone ELSES changes but now we have this small list of changes we would like aded"
---
A troll shaman named Thex
---
There's retail for players with such conditions.
---
Think about it for literally a SECOND. By only having a couple of servers available at the start you force every big guild to decide to roll on these servers. If you're later going to add more servers the big guilds aren't going to roll on those anymore cause it's too late to change now. This creates a situation where there's a couple of overcrowded servers instead of having a more evenly spread out population.
---
He means meaningful world content. Not just bosses that have shifted to being difficult because everyone has at least 20 mechanics in a complete FFXIV rip off.
---
Quiet! Here comes Thrall  
---
LOK'THAR OGAR ALLIANCE SCUM!
---
Nah. I get a raptor to ride. I don't need a wolf...
---
Even at 'High' there will be queues.
---
It'll be fine. Even if theres dead servers they'll just add in migration shortly after. Worst case scenario you have an easy time leveling up, harder time finding group, and then take the freebie transfer to a med-pop.
---
The dark blue with that drop shadow makes it really difficult to read! Otherwise looks great!
---
&gt;  I only hope people will want to celebrate in-game.
---
To an extent they should since Blizzard has been doing anniversary things in WoW for years. Whether or not those will happen eventually in Classic, who knows :P
---
Vanilla had DR's?
---
Has Westfall been added to the survey because I need to change my answers if so.
---
Love when clueless people are pretending being experts
---
Just my experience leveling up back in the day, I would almost never do dungeons to level and quest because sitting in a city looking for a group that would take forever to come together, it at all, just kinda sucked and actively stopped you from playing the game. And if it didn't come together you just wasted hours of limited playtime.   
---
I understand why people don't like it though, it wasn't in vanilla. But if they ever expand on vanilla or start progression servers like EQ, or splinter off like 07scape, I wouldn't mind if they add a more limited LFG system.
---
I had that exact bedding for years lol
---
Honestly screen time wasn't monitored for me. I just needed to do my daily lessons/schoolwork, finish chores, and play/exercise. Dinner was at 6 and bed time was 9 on weekdays and 10 on weekends. Other than that free time was my time. 
---
4 May be early for that exact schedule but you get the picture.
---
God damnit I hate that smug fuck j Allen brack. Even moreso for this whole QA panel and the huge demand for classic.
---
Guess what bitch. We did want that. A LOT OF US WANTED THAT.
---
I'm waiting until Monday to pick a server. I want the least populated one so I don't have as bad a q time.
---
Thanks autocorrect 😂
---
its gunna happen thru a website if not in game, dont let it ruin your experience and just let it happen imo
---
These PSA posts are so fucking lame
---
/who -c"Warrior" 
---
something like that is the command
---
http://is2.4chan.org/v/1566432564515.jpg
---
Take this feminists
---
Piggybacking on your movement stuff, rebind the a and e keys to strafe left and right. I think the default is q and e for that. The default a and e just rotate your character in a stationary fashion and are pointless, imo. 
---
Also, that frees up q and e for skills.
---
Other tips I would give is PICK A CHARACTER! I always have alt-itis and I hate it. It delayed me from experiencing really cool shit at higher levels.
---
Take a lot of the negativity you will encounter on forums like this for wow with a massive grain of salt. It seems to me that when people spend massive amounts of their life on something, they begin to treat their vision or opinion on whatever that is as fact or like the true reflection of what that thing should be. It's not. It's just their opinion. Sometimes an extremely well thought out and informed opinion, sometimes it's just shortsighted and self serving.
---
Become part of the community, whatever server you end up on. The memories that will last, and what makes this game so great is the stories that happen organically when you choose to engage with the people around you.
---
Don't level as protection if you go warrior.
---
Roll on a pvp server. 
---
When you're grinding some area for a few hours, Netflix and all that can be great on the second monitor. BUT! Sometimes just turn the in game music way up and really dig into that. It's great.
---
/spit on the enemy faction if you kill them. Especially if you fight of a rogue that tried to gank you.
---
There's a million more tips to give, but I've gone on long enough. Just have a great time, dude. The game is truly what you make it.
---
Yea, no. That's a bullshit argument. Don't use the add-on. Problem fixed. By your logic if you use discord you should be playing retail cause there was no discord in vanilla and it makes everything a lot easier. Some people man.
---
That's because Westfall is on the Eastern Continent.
---
Ahh, ok got it, thanks. So fury is good for pve (for my purposes) and arms will be better for PvP? Do you have any builds suggestions?
---
I don't imagine westfall being dead, server names matter to people. But if you're going have horde I imagine your going to get stomped into the ground hard.
---
Dem bias goggles on you boi
---
There are stats on a gun though ?  
---
Am I gravely mistaken to think they are taken into account ? Kind of how stats on a melee weapon affects your ranged dps when you play hunt ? Isn't it exactly the same thing ?
---
Kaplan's character was named Tigole (for tig ol' bitties)
---
Do you like healing?
---
I Still know the lyrics
---
This is why I left wow. Dungeon and raid finder took away the importance of maintaining a healthy guild, and filled the game with toxic behaviour. Once people realised that they could behave any way they wanted without risk of losing the guild they were part of, the game changed.
---
And what addon would that be ?
---
oh bro i'm dipping on em
---
100 percent just play on. The lads will catch up eventually.
---
But why would you give out your e-mail to some random on a private server or official Blizzard server?
---
Doxing sounds highly improbable.
---
Its slow and unforgiving. Its not hard, its entirely a numbers game - pulled too many mobs because you didnt wait for a patrol? A warrior would die while other classes might have tools to deal with these mishaps with good play and quick thinking.
---
They also have a lot of downtime and quite poor killspeed (because of rage generation mostly), and that makes them slow levellers. But it's not hard.
---
Curse be on parents who know computer stuff 8(
---
This is literally like the LFG Tool from retail.
---
The LFG tool provides you an interface to create and/or look up a group LFM people for a specific raid or dungeon.
---
Sounds pretty similar to this add-on
---
Quickly responding to your comment to say you meant "D" a lot of the time when you said "E".
---
So, rebind "A" and "D" and keep "Q" and "E" for strage is what you meant :P
---
Why would you wait for launch to sub when you could get a free name reservation? Any sane person who knows they're going to play Classic anyway is not going to wait until launch to sub if they know they can get an advantage by committing to a sub early.
---
No. But the thing is, someone buying caffeine pills is likely to be using them to stay awake far longer than he/she should. There is several threads on reddit and ppl on discords talking about 30 to 45 hours no sleep etc. For the majority it's nothing. Problem is there is serious side effects possible due to this. And people promote it around, like it's cool to stay up for hours on end, and come crying 10 years later because they were unlucky and developed insomnia or night terrors.
---
Social media is like a petri dish for bad behavior to spread. And being called health police for trying to be proactive and helping before bad decisions happen is just outrageous.
---
that people,  was literallt hitler.   
---
bam, bet you feel bad now #nochanges scum.
---
#changes! ban vanilla like addons!
---
I remember that addon was already present in one way or another in vanilla. It was much easier than spamming a macro. I don't see the problem. You'll still not be ported and you still went to voice for every dungeon. Unlike today.
---
I think ppl are so overreacting on this one. Because "certain" person blow this topic out of the proportion so much. The only reason classic back in the day didn't had that made by some player is the technology wasn't there yet to make addon like that. And besides ppl will do discord channel for group/raid finder. Thing is YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE IT. If you ignore the addon and the discord channel. Your experience for classic won't be affected at all.
---
Huh, it does look correct now. The numbers were way off when I wrote.
---
Difficult isn't really the word I would use for scepter. It's a long and arduous process, requiring crazy dedication sure, but I don't reallyu think any part of it is actually *difficult*. It's not *difficult* to kill thousands of silithids with your guild. It's not *difficult* to kill nefarian twice or kill a handful of other world bosses. Not to rag on the achievement or anything, it's absolutely nuts and I respect anyone who gets it like crazy, but not because it was difficult, rather it was time consuming.
---
Arathi basin won't be out for a while
---
Mods is da poop! No more!
---
If you pick priest you're still going to spec disc/shadow until 60. You won't actually spec for holy (if you want to main healer) until 60. Shadow priest is a ton of fun too.
---
oh thats sound good. thank you.
---
ty
---
bruh meeting stones were never used. The function was completely useless because it would just grab random players and put them in a group.
---
It was for the best too that nobody used it. The social aspect of the game would have been eliminated if you just had to afk at a meeting stone until a group forms for you.
---
Didn't LFR preceed the current LFG tool in retail? 
---
Kinda makes your point moot, if so.
---
Lol. K.
---
I just provided four summaries of studies that found that limiting screen time for kids is eneficial, which goes counter to your baseless claim.
---
The only people affected by this are dps. Let's not pretend for a second tanks(and healers a bit) word isn't law. They know it. You know it.
---
Mmhm.
---
Its ok. Ill be a tank. And i love tanking. Its all i wanna do.
---
Still no extra oceanic realms
---
Name aside, what's the best aim for server population? Medium, high?
---
We are doing a LAN party, I'm afraid someone's going to alt f4 my game when I go pee, out of jealousy :D
---
Yeah true that!
---
I am generally a nice person, but i do hate the guy who did this.
---
I hope the communities rally against this sort of thing and blacklist guilds that push for this nonsense. You can be pretty confident that you'll have a bad time with a group that demands ilvl from people.
---
I hqve always played horde and so fed up with them. I am rolling alliance this time.
---
you googled articles meant to scare soccer moms.  Link me a study you stand behind.  you have no fucking clue what you linked lol....
---
Might as well not play tbh
---
I was impressed with many of the Orc scenes, they were gorgeous. But the Human scenes, mind boggling lore fuckery + abrupt scene cuts really really bothered me. I really wished it as more lore accurate.
---
Just wondering, is there a horde version for this? It would be greatly appreciated!
---
Apparently over 2 years ago :(
---
U a wizard harry
---
He can run to you at 1
---
You can literally use a white weapon as a hunter, all you do is wing clip with it. If you stole a melee weapon upgrade from a warrior/rogue you're worse than a warrtard.
---
Also no target dummies or ice lance in vanilla and alot of spells he has on bars arnt in it either
---
Yeah because when you shout LFG people can see your spec/build like they can with this addon right? It's going to be trivial to add an ilvl mechanic to it as well so don't be dishonest and say it's only replacing the chat experience.
---
If I were you I'd focus on finishing every starting quest zone, then meet at about level 13-14 outside Org to move over towards The Barrens
---
Byte till någon av de nya? Inte sugen på 10000 kö... Mograine låter trevligt
---
Wpvp is mage all the way, part of the hunter struggle that no one talks about is the melee dead zone.
---
Raids is also Mages
---
I'm going to roll on Zandalar Tribe, but I gotta admit. Mograine is one badass name. On launch day the server will be flooded.
---
They do it via whatever you have public, whether it is a reddit, discord, twitch, twitter, or any other form of social media. Some players wouldn't be affected by this, but others have a lot on the internet and don't expect any issues until they happen.
---
As for how WoW accounts are hacked, I have no clue. However, I don't want to find out, so I have 2FA.
---
Ok, I might get some hate here, 
---
BUT
---
I actually really like Dungeon Finder. I think it just takes a little too much time to form a group thru chat sometimes. 
---
CALL ME A FILTHY CASUAL, SURE.
---
I love everything else about vanilla tho. Find me a group ill still take the walk, I just dont like the chat spam and how long it takes sometimes.
---
Questie is just about the only addon I use, anyhow.
---
You think we wanted BfA, but we didn't.
---
Here's my take on this, first off I am not talking about a single class x2-5 but different ones.
---
Had /played to the tune of a few months on my rogue which apart from the relative danger out in the zones was rather... simple to play, now when you want to control 2+ character the complexity could perhaps make the whole endeavor more interesting.
---
As for the Multiplayer vs singleplayer aspect, I would love it if I could find someone that would match perfectly my rotating schedule, desire to play and class combo I have in mind but alas we don't live in that perfect world, plus I think I will be basically leveling and doing farming with that should I go through with it.
---
Yeah, there's no way in this day and age you can replecate the feel of classic.
---
That's why you need a piss bucket ;D
---
I just provided four summaries of studies that found that limiting screen time for kids is beneficial,  which goes counter to your baseless claim that it has no impact.
---
Maybe it’d *you* actually read them, you’d see that all four agree that unlimited amounts of screen time causes maturational problems, and mental health problems in children ages 2-17. 
---
I’m done. Learn to admit when you’re wrong.
---
My classic plans have been continuously spinning for months.
---
I'm just gonna see where the wheel stops at release time.
---
This add-on is literally like the current version of LFG in retail WoW. Except this add-on has auto-invite and LFG doesn't.
---
This add-on is not like the LFD or LFR system in Retail.
---
There is a youtube video with like 14 or 15
---
Addons were a part of vanilla and ive been using them since the start. You are objectively wrong here. Your view of whatever the fuck you want to call "the spirit of vanilla" is based on some sort of dumb idea that playing the game without addons is somehow going to make it more fun, like you are deleting your previous knowledge and are now new to the game again.
---
If 30% of players use this addon and 40% of players use Discord, that just leaves 30% of people using the actual ingame chat systems.
---
Why do people want to spread themselves thin and make finding a group harder for everyone when they could all just use the LFG channel or World chat?
---
I would say around 5 if you want to avoid a lot of deaths from mobs. When ready one of you can hop on the zeppelin  from org/undercity.
---
нет больше никакой привязки, уже несколько лет можно играть на Европе с ру учёткой
---
After killing the 2nd last boss of molten core? And you can only use the stave or the bow, and the bow was BiS until Chromaggus in BWL. 
---
The good AP weapons just happened to be 2H swords.
---
I had zin’rokh from ZG and was rolling off against a non-raiding alt and still has to argue for the upgrade.
---
Good race for rogue then
---
Mods are weird. Your edit clearly has more effort put in it.
---
I thought alliance had more quests
---
Oh god. Don’t do that. There are dozens upon dozens who will try to cash in on “top 5 Classic ______” videos. Machinimas are good OC and no one really makes them anymore as they are too high effort. Free real estate!
---
I read it religion at first...
---
 I know I'm late but World PvP means a lot fo me so I want to share my thoughts.
---
* How important is World PVP for you to enjoy Classic?
---
Extremely, World PvP is by far the most fun I've ever had in WoW. I even managed to have fun when they added Flying in Azeroth though it forever made it worse.
---
* If on a PvE server, when (if ever) do you set your flag for PvP?
---
I wouldn't ever be on a PvE server but if I ever found myself on one my PvP would always be flagged even when leveling.
---
* What are your policies on open-world ganking, e.g. do you attack players at low health or if they're fighting a mob?
---
Typically I leave people alone if they are leveling I want World PvP to be fun for everyone, I am extremely against camping unless this person did something to deserve it.
---
* What is your favorite Battleground, and why?
---
AV, it is the BG that feels most like World PvP
---
* What's your craziest PvP story?
---
I vividly remember me and my cousin were both around level 15-20 and we managed to kill a ?? Horde player who tried to kill use. It's one of things that got me into World PvP
---
The zoomer looks like a mix between me and my mate.
---
We're plenty of friendly people on the server. You'll make friends once the server launches, no need to "prep" the friendships here :)
---
Well I'm fucked then
---
Don't use LFR. Problem fixef.
---
Yea, no. That's a bullshit argument.
---
would be nice to have, coming from someone with no idea what items are out there
---
Early on there won't be many, if any, crafted wands. Its best to go to Darkshore (since you should be there anyway) and get the ones from the quest.
---
кайф, спасибо
---
Every person with self respect plays dwarfs
---
By 1.12 it did. So we will for Classic.
---
BfA Is BaD, ClAsSiC Is GoOd
---
&gt; Getting past that, what do you think about this spec? It focuses on getting spell critz to improve melee crit chance by 9% (elemental devastation talent) in order to help Flurry procs (which improves threat generation). IMO for it to work however it really needs eye of the storm so that you'd be able to cast spells while getting hit. Though I can't think of how to put more than 1 point into it without taking too many points out of enhancement. Is the build spread too thin?
---
hope this helps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05snKc32nbE
---
Yes. It’s exactly the same
---
&gt;Any sane person who knows they're going to play Classic anyway is not going to wait
---
Found the problematic thought process. You think people that are insane for waiting for a purchase till it becomes relevant. I have friends that still haven't subbed and don't care about names. You are seriously discounting the chance of diversity of thought. At least we figured out where the loose link in your chain was.
---
That guy isn't even using a catheter, hahaha
---
Well a lot of commands have been in the game for a long time. Probably still works.
---
Alternatively you can write
---
Warrior 35-40 ironforge
---
It has worked for me back in the day. 
---
Most protection specced warriors arent running around in the zones doing quests.
---
Of course any warrior can tank in arms spec as long as they got defensive stance and arent an idiot. Thats how i did when i leveled my warrior in vanilla
---
Iirc blizz even tuned the TBC heroic dungeons to be tankable by an arms warrior in defensive stance
---
We wanted to get more servers from start and now that we got it of course we are going to be a bit annoyed.
---
To make so many new servers at the start and we who bought a subscription 2 weeks before to coordinate with friends and guilds to get name and where to play feels almost fucked now that this couldn't had been distributed much easier at the start.
---
To have the servers that we will be forced to move to so we can actually log in and then try reserve names one more time makes me feel I just wasted 2 weeks of subscription cash....
---
I consider a second account and just use it to fish in the background
---
Big brain time
---
could you just link me 1 study that you believe shows that "screen time" is bad?   if you can't do that how can you tell me I'm wrong?   no doubt in the 12 links you've provided I can reach studies but any 1 I debunk you'll just be like LOL LOOK AT ALL THESE OTHERS.  You won't commit to 1 because you haven't read ANY of them.  you're the reason antivaxxers exist
---
Right? it doesn't make getting a replacement payer actually to your instance and faster or more reliable. 
---
And it doesn't make it any more likely you will find a replacement healer/tank for a half cleared dungeon before trash re-spawns anyway.
---
Do you really think that some "Chinese low quality via bots" service would exist nowadays? =\\ Dude, that's just stupid with all the technologies game companies has now. So I'm pretty sure it's not what this is all about.
---
Myaree here in WA :)
---
"Each of the Full realms has a LOT of characters to the extent that it may be more than can fit into the queue system. As a result, you may not be able to get into the queue when you want to play and even if you do, it will likely be a very long wait."
---
Very important blizzard posts this message at the log in screen for the first week.
---
Herod on launch night will be 8+hour queues. 
---
The goal is to DETER people from waiting on those queues and choose another server.
---
It's not meant to fit everyone that wants to play on that server.
---
"All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full."
---
Yeah this.
---
I don't understand why people want to use every 3rd party option instead of the simple to use ingame chat channels that everyone in the game can be a part of. Finding a group through the LFG channel or World chat would be faster than anything since 100% of players will be in game. Only like 30% will be on Discord looking for groups, but that 30% will be removed from the actual ingame pool of players.

Why hit reply button if you have no idea what you're talking about???
---
ISboxer shall rule them all! I love the software. Gonna 5-box myself. What server you playing on bro?
---
It depends on class. I.e. warrior if you want to tank just make sure you pick up taunt and tsunder armor.
---
It is far batter than spamming the lfg channel
---
It's going to be interesting for blizz when fewer actually buy the next expansion because they can just play classic.
---
Satyr horns in Ashenvale. 2 manned it for over an hour
---
&gt; That's not what this addon is capable of though.
---
Haven't looked in depth myself, but what I've read elsewhere in these threads indicate it's capable of exactly that, plus some of the autoinvite functionality (which, in all honesty, is something that you probably won't *want* on).
---
&gt; If this addon sticks around, we might as well ask Blizzard to keep the current LFG tool the client already has because whats the point of removing it if an addon adds it all back to the game?
---
That's a *tremendous* discredit to how much the parts of LFG that an addon *can't* replicate- teleporting, cross-realm, bypassing heroic lockouts via random heroic dungeon queues- were part of the effect the LFG tool had.
---
Only a law in certain countries tho :)

I've been gasping for this all week. Love the show mate, thanks for all the hard work in making it.

Guess you can’t have it all, which I understand and am very realistic.

I played a frost mage prior so I’m pretty much open to suggestions
---
The French are hardcore.

Healing is more fun than DPS IMO, especially priest healing is super versatile and you'll be making quick decisions and reacting to stuff instead of just pressing the keybinding for frostbolt. Both classes are in good demand though.

 Rightfully so! You know, I’m something of a bear ass expert myself. Let me lay down the basics of a pristine bear ass. It must be plump but not gelatinous. It must be firm but not rock hard. It must be fragrant but not overpowering. The butthole must have a perfect pentagram shape which is incredibly rare. There are just so many parameters that make up what we scientists know as the perfect bear ass.
---
You’re asking r/ClassicWoW if people will enjoy Classic WoW?
---
Nope, we all hate the game here. We browse this sub for the Eric Andre memes.
---
hell no to this! talk to people. it’s a social game. it’s meant to build bonds. i still have friends i met back in 2005 because i hd to actually talk to people. it’s a HUGE part of the game. it is essential to Vanilla WoW.

Beer and coffeine and perhaps nicotine.

Better start time travelling and getting rid of [Call To Arms](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/CallToArms/).
---
Zin'Rokh is bascially little Ashkandi in every sense. Less dps, less AP, easier to get, prestigous, but not as much. Pretty much all the same reasons apply for it as do for Ashkandi.
---
But why ? They have always been a part of canilla wow, like it or not.
---
Im just super fed up with this BS health policing. its launch week, its not a permanent life change.
---
It’s great that I have unique nickname and lots variations of it so I don’t need to spend money for extra two weeks of playtime
---
You have no idea wtf you're talking about...
---
what are the chances there is some kind of technical problem that prevents people from playing in the first hour
---
This isn't LFR. This isn't even dungeon finder. This is vanilla meeting stones, but global. There were similar add-ons in vanilla. Stop crying over nothing, atleast go back to crying about skeletons, that was atleast entertaining.

What's the Orcish for "Redbull and Talent"?
---
Good points! I guess I'm less afraid.
---
Son who is 4 plays a hunter because he likes pets and daughter who is 7 plays a druid. We limit screen time more so during week so they play with there toys or read. They only play wow once or twice a week. Me and my wife play most evenings once they are in bed but killing time for classic atm.
---
Summer aswell it's a bit easier because then they can go in the garden
---
Yeah. Sounds about right.
---
Can this be banned already? No need to be in Classic.
---
Don't forget that there's also [Flintlocke's Guide to Azeroth](http://flintlocke.thecomicseries.com/), who've had plenty of running gags/references throughout retail as well!
---
do you need the servers to be actually up to make plans? why?
---
pft caffeine is for the weak, the strong stay up with willpower
---
&gt;I think that if blizz let people reserve their names for free it would give them really inaccurate info cuz a lot of people would reserve name and then never play the game or just create a character only thinking about maybe playing.  
---
Not if they have to commit to a sub if they want to reserve a name. Not many people are going to pay 15 bucks and then never play.
---
I created my 3 chars on 3 different realms, 2 of them warriors with different races and 1 as an orc rogue. I just went to a randomizer page, put the 3 real names, closed my eyes and rolled for a bit. 
---
Now I'm glad I am playing my Orc Warrior, eventhough the randomizer told me to go rogue, but I wanted what I would like to play by the time I had to open my eyes
---
That is.. a really good point
---
No shit is better, but you could definitely tackle karazhan in t3
---
I'm sorry I remembered wrong on that part. My bad.
---
What the fuck????
---
They're in the login que
---
exactly. its so lame with these people and their overreactions to minor things.
---
Blizzard should wait 1 or 2 month before opening more servers, peoole will get tired of classic soon and the servers will be half dead.
---
Why would they not try to make as much Revenue from this as possible?
---
Afterall they are owned by Activision and they Need to Show their earnings.
---
I'm not too sure how Activision felt about Classic but I'm quite sure that they want to see income from it as soon as possible. 
---
Blizzard has to get as much as possible out of classic which I don't blame them for. Afterall we just have to pay for the subscription. 
---
I'm very happy to pay 1 month extra subscription (opt in) rather than buying the game for 30-40 bucks again.
---
I think Blizzard has taken the nice route with us just having to pay for the Sub a Little earlier (If we really wanted to reserve names) and not grabing more cash.
---
If this Thing Flops - which I hope it doesn't - I'm not too sure whether we will ever see any TBC or WOTLK Servers.
---
Just be happy with what we got and please don't blame Blizzard they Need to Show figures. And this is a easy way to get it and also quite nice because it is opt-in.
---
It's true.. the off-centered login button cannot be unseen.
---
Before TBC, we did. [Call To Arms](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/CallToArms/)
---
i hope so man
---
Your cancerous PVP discords may be like that, but on Mirage, everybody is friendly, with just a bit of friendly banter! (And gnome hating.)
---
Like [Call To Arms](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/CallToArms/) did?
---
forming groups aside, i was talking to an old friend that i used to play with in vanilla and we were saying there are going to be a lot of people leave when they realise just how different the game is and how much harder it can be to do the basic things, getting a mount at 40 for example. it will get to the point, thankfully, that all that will be left on classic are the ones that truly want the classic experience and not some hybrid of classic and retail.
---
I agree with the sentiment, but retail started to die long before ilvl or gear score were things. LFR/LFD were the real "beginning of the end".
---
Play with your friends dude, that's the most important part of a game imo. Horde are genuinely really fun and tend to be a bit more laid back than alliance (from what I've experienced). I've been horde since Vanilla, tried alliance in TBC and in WotLK and just couldn't enjoy the cities or races - they're too "safe" when it comes to high fantasy for me. Rather be the underdog, uglier faction!

---
Stop. Bullshitting me.
---
Paladin: dwarf is better for pvp bc of stoneskin, human is nice for the rep buff but generally the difference is not big, pick whatever you think looks better :)
---
Sadly i cant help you out on the rogue part, but i guess dwarfs are also good bc of stoneskin
---
haha these corny nerds are completely delusional. Theyre so out of touch with how AWFUL the economy is going to be when theres 20, 30, 40+ layers(basically 20, 30, 40+ the amount of resources farmed) during phase 1.
---
They WILL NOT be able to control all of the layers. They also think they're going to control FULL servers, haha man these dipshits dont even have 100 people and they want to "only farm" without having high end raid/contested gear and then tag along once they pay for some guilds consumes??? Yea dude, everyones gonna be DYING to get their hands on full consumes for their 5months of exclusively MC+Ony. BIG LAUGH.
---
What was even worse was listening to the two clowns in the vod buy into it and act like these guys are going to NEFARIOUSLY RUIN THE SERVER. turbo cringe. move on, these guys wont even be a blip on the servers map.
---
Not going to make much of a difference which class you play as rogue since shadowmeld doesn't work in combat. Human for pally spirit buff.
---
If you think this is bullying your a bitch
---
Cheers
---
I don't see why people would do that tbh. I played private server classic wow on at least 5 different servers everyone just made parties in game.
---
If you try to get someone to play a game, DO NOT help them. It’s important to let them figure it out on their own
---
Exactly. What if Blizzard said "In classic LFG will no longer Teleport you to instance, but just be used to decrease traffic in trade" everyone would be pissed AF. 
---
But now because it's an addon, everyone just jumps on board for some reason. I don't want this addon, and I hope it doesn't stick.
---
There are two rogue raid builds. Combat swords and combat daggers.
---
Combat swords is okay-ish in PvP. Absolutely not ideal but it can do some work. Much better for grinding mobs in the open world too. Downside is that almost everybody goes combat swords, so you are going to compete for sword drops with all of the rogues AND all of the fury warriors.
---
Combat daggers is utterly atrocious in PvP. Almost completely useless. You are at a huge disadvantage when running it. It is easier to get weapons on a relative scale though, and the core PvP builds use daggers so if you respec to CB/Prep or Seal Fate you have the weapon you need right there.
---
Well I also subbed early and I feel a bit annoyed because I wasn’t able (in three attempts) to get the name I wanted purely because it took so long for me to log in each time. 
---
However I am happy enough with the names I got. I also like to think of it this way, by subbing early we’ve helped Blizzard to gain more data and to plan out this launch much better than if they’d just had a kind of zero-day launch.
---
I doubt many people share my way of thinking but I have a lot of respect for how they’ve done it. I’d rather they are careful and cautious with the servers than having too few, or too many at launch. Even if people don’t agree with how they’ve gone about it, I think almost everyone can agree that at the very least, Blizzard care a lot about getting this right.
---
I hear $10,000 can go along way in some circles.
---
I guess it means something like "skip the boring part, enjoy the fun part" - some ppl are not ready to spend a month or two leveling to the 60 =\\
---
Humans have spirit buff. Pally is much better with human.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Classic good; Retail bad. Guild this comment for making brave statements
---
Rogues love you sitting down
---
I will download vQueue and you cannot do nothing to stop me lfr heroes
---
For Rogue Human if you want to go swords, otherwise any of the other 3 are fine.
---
This is so tangibly EVE Online and I fucking love it.
---
So what you said leads to another question if you wouldn’t mind. Once I start getting those other higher end daggers that you mentioned, from MC and BWL does the hybrid build become more optimal? Or does it stay pretty subpar in pvp and just excelling in pve ?
---
Cool story bro
---
Plenty of people are dungeon grinding to 60.
---
Just imagine the face of rogues and warriors when you gonna need on Kingsfall and Iblis as they are bis late game. Or dual dal rends for early game
---
How dare you .
---
Who c war ?
---
I do, i see war everywhere around me.
---
 /spit
---
Unless a few players in your group got in early ;)
---
Didn’t think I had any leave left until I checked and I had 4 days that I’ve now booked in...not all on launch week though, one on Tuesday (we have a national holiday in England on Monday) and then on consecutive Mondays after launch for 3 long, nostalgic, wow-filled weekends .
---
U must be one of them retail scums my dad told me stories about..
---
I think that when there is less automation(teleports, dungeon finders etc) or simplification(gearscore, item acquisition) being asshole is harder. When you need to take time to manually find a group, ask for invite and get in location. You can gauge what people are like (how they write, what their gear looks like, how long it takes for them to get to location etc). And the fact that you get to know people on your server makes people to be on better behavior.
---
All those things take effort and time. More time and effort you put in to things, the more likely you are to try to stay in and not cause drama or be the "ruiner of fun". Your reputation will follow you and if you are "that guy" it will get harder and harder to do things that require other people. 
---
Whenever you get to play with people that stand out in positive light you tend to try and add them to form groups or even communities in future.
---
Adjust my UI, then level.
---
Trust me, they figured it out in Delve just fine.
---
In random bgs a healer will go a long way
---
And some people would prefer it that way, game is apparently so damn easy nobody should need addons when they farming Naxx /s
---
Hehe you made my day
---
This
---
I expect blizzneys ban hammer to be very busy
---
Umm no?
---
Because that BiS slot affects a melee class 90% more than you. For you having a BiS for melee is a peace of mind thing, for them its life or death.
---
Take your keyboard with you.
---
Anything man, anything. Something good PvP and pve
---
Blizzard have stated that even medium pop servers have larger populations than the largest servers back in vanilla
---
The whole subscribing for a name is stupid. Like I understand that everyone in your guild knows you as LilPeePee but it's not a big deal if you have to change it to LilPooPoo. It's even worse that people are buying their names that were taken by someone else. Like sure, spend your money however you want, but it's completely pointless.
---
I'm EU, will play on a normal server that's above Medium with not crazy queues come launch :P
---
People left dungeons all the time back then.
---
Just keep in mind Teldrassil (and even Darnassus) does not have all the class trainers, so don't go there if you are rolling mage or warlock
---
Not enough to make it worth adding it to my first comment.
---
The irony in all these LFG Addon threads is that they're spreading the information that they exist to more people. IF Blizzard now doesn't do anything about it you're helping creating what you didn't want to happen.
---
Big balls risk play.
---
Only play a Priest if you want/enjoy healing
---
That's the spirit.
---
Oh sorry, I totally misunderstood you then.
---
+5 sword skill is a significant boost to damage for rogues-- Combat Sword spec is the best raid DPS spec in the game-- Other rogues have to resort to very specific pieces of loot to gain the +5 sword skill that humans get by default. To be fair, it is much more important for a warrior to be human compared to a rogue-- because rogues have a talent that gives +5 sword skill also (the soft cap is 308 afaik). So human rogues get 310 by default and are good to go for the softcap for glancing blows. This translates to superior dps, albeit slightly-- and also human rogues will get priority on swords typically-- If you roll Gnome/Dwarf/Nightelf you have a good shot at getting BiS daggers though (Corehound Tooth / Perdition's Blade once it's added). It's easy to get the +wep skill for daggers too from certain dungeons. Dagger rogues are less dps overall I believe-- but they are still competitive and can outdps swords players who aren't as skilled in certain scenarios. I prefer the spiky crit gameplay of daggers personally (your backstabs get a talented +30% chance to crit).
---
Any of the English EU realms will be English speaking dominated so don’t worry about it
---
My screen time was more or less limited. I somehow beat Diablo 2 when I was 6, which I to this day don't believe. Simply because I can't recreate it. (used a summoner necromancer), so personally I say 6 is a good age to start, but I know I was gaming at least a year beforehand.
---
I also believe it's best to limit their screen time so they can at least healthily explore other aspects of life. Even though I only game now, I am thankful I got to go outside even when I didn't want to. It's beneficial to keep things changing or just keep multiple options around for healthy development.
---
That's right. I responded proactively, because that's a trend I see among the HC crowd in games. I feel it's implied if one showcases caffeine pills. If it isn't the case, I rest my case.

Hunters who know their shit will be ok with rok delar and the crossbow from Chromagus. No other ranged upgrade till nax Anub rekhan's xbow if i am not mistaken. The only problem is the melee stat sticks which are main weapons for melee classes :(

Dang I didn't know Robert Downey Jr. was part of the WoW Classic team.
---
It was one of those places you thought "huh, i bet they are going to do something cool with that raceway. I bet we can drive them some day!"
---
Option 1: Player 1 runs to Player 2 at Level 1.  
---
It's doable if you stick to the roads. You'll still die a lot. But you start everything together. Expect lots of deaths and laughs trying to do the journey.
---
Option 2: Player 1 runs to Player 2 at Level 5.   
---
You each do your own starting zones then meet at any of the players 5-10 zone. A little safer. 
---
Option 3: You meet at the Barrens at 10-13.  
---
The least stressful option but the most boring as it might be days before you can meet each other.
---
IMHO I would run at Level 1. Just google the route and work out which is the best/safest way to do it.
---
I think you might be forgetting the massive influx of players that will only be subbing the night before launch
---
I don't have a study I said there haven't been any good ones showing it's bad.  more accurately I haven't seen one.
---
Just check with a Dps simulator
---
Thanks for keeping the shitters out of my group, r.io!
---
I had a pretty excellent reputation back in the day as a Resto Shaman. I had a lot of time to play being in my School years so ended up being the best geared Resto Shaman on my server.
---
Outside of raid times I'd stand around showing of my gear and looking swol af.
---
But I'd also be watching trade chat and if I saw a group looking for a healer for to long for a dungeon I'd just swing in and help out.
---
Made a lot of friends helping under geared bros crush dungeons.
---
Warrior sucks ass try something else: )
---
Looks like everyone playing bfa heading to classic lol
---
Frost mage
---
Can’t seem to be bothered finding anything giving a specific time*
---
What a load of shit. A large chunk of what this magical addon claims to do is not possible, not without somehow getting every single person on the server to install it and send the data to a central addon. It's a troll.
---
From what I've seen even the lowest English speaking realms were about 80% English so I wouldn't worry.
---
Ok, but that's not the point of this topic.
---
Pretty hilarious when I resubbed 2 weeks ago and noticed regular mythical drop higher Ivl then my full mythic 7-10 gear i farmed at the begging of the expac
---
&gt;20, 30, 40+ layers
---
My god, this sub has really lost it hasn't it. And of course you also disregard that increase in players due to the layers, since it goes hand-in-hand.
---
Unfortunately, my classes at uni start on THE SAME DAY as classic launch. Unfortunate, but you can bet that I'll be spending all my free time going on adventures with my fellow Horde.
---
I'll be exercising at my local rock climbing gym for about an hour and a half per day, because a healthy rush of endorphins will probably make me a bit more sociable and alert.
---
As far as diet is concerned, as much as I want to go hard into the junk foods, I won't be able to keep it up for long. So I'm thinking I'll stick to my regular diet but with a few bags of Peanut m&amp;m's thrown in.
---
For chores, I think I've got pretty much everything in order, but there's a certain hiking trail in my area thats going to be closing for winter shortly after the classic launch, so I think I really just want to hike that before launch and then I'll be happy to spend all my free hours casting spells.
---
Just go paladin and heal
---
Whatever you have rebound it to. On my mage its counterspell.
---
Whatever it takes!! May the force be with you!
---
Hi, /u/g3n0m4
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cub6um/is_there_a_database_or_addon_that_shows_all/). 
---
What downsides? You're being really nebulous. Tell me what specific downside that I am missing by not having to manually parse a chat channel that is moving faster than Summit1G's twitch chat during stream? You do realize that there will be 15 to 20,000 people in each global LFG chat right? Even with enforced slow mode where you are throttled after 2 messages per 2 minutes, you will not be able to read the chat because it will be moving at warp speed. 
---
Without an addon like this a human being cannot parse the speed that chat will be moving at, especially since only 10 or so lines are visible by default, and it will be scrolling constantly. You will never see someone saying "LF healer DM tribute runs" or anything like that because it will be gone beyond the capability to scrollback within a couple seconds.
---
Hype zerg
---
me too; i think this is a really important facet of the game that is largely overlooked
---
Somebody's bitter. So edgy.
---
They are very much aware of how hype trains work. There will be a massive demand on launch, but it will rapidly decline over a few months to reach a fairly stable but much lower population. They don't want 50 mostly empty servers running when 5 would do.
---
This isn't new and was 100% a thing in vanilla. Blame the idiots not focusing on their AH purchases, not the smart people tricking them.
---
Ahh looks great. I had to scroll up and down a bit to be sure those stars weren't the dust on my monitor! :D
---
How does warlocks have teh same problem? There are usually 4-5 pr raid and there is max 1 shadowpriest. and the lock number keeps rising the later the game is out, the shadowpriest number does not. And a warlock is way more wanted in 5mans than a shadowpriest.
---
They even stated low servers are higher than the full were. I'd go for médium to avoid the queues, personally.
---
Simpler times
---
He's an edgelord. Ignore him.

Shazzrah is the go to for a very big part of polish community that comes from Burning Legion.

I just won't use it. If you will, we simply never will be grouped together.
---
They deserve it
---
Well see who would have the last laugh!!!!        P.S. certainly not me, I didn't get the pop name I wanted :/
---
Makes me think of people on their way to a festival.
---
Nice artwork!
---
Reee quality of life
---
So if it's using its own channel will this mean that if you join there and become the leader of the channel somehow of being online for a long time. 
---
You could start ban/mute people in that specific channel that's using the addon to auto spam and thus making it not being able to find or ask for groups since ppl have been blocked in the channel. Or am I wrong?
---
Ikr
---
I think you may be over exaggerating how many are subbing on 26th
---
Then say before the run that you will need on the weapon.
---
Improved AoTH 0 ?  
---
Mhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
'Invite from whispers' addons existed in vanilla too so this is nothing new.  There were also mass raid invite addons back then too (my guild leader used one to automatically invite for Molten Core).  These are not new things.
---
But a tool that shows an interface of people lists you can browse, even if it's technically not much different to typing commands in chat, the fact is that it treats people as commodities and goes against the social aspect of classic Wow.  So it should go.  The LFG tool in retail Wow treats people as commodities - you don't care who, what, why, where - you just press a button and 4 slaves appear to get you through the content.
---
Friendships in vanilla Wow were very strong and that's because it took time and effort to mature them.  When you start treating people as commodities, that friendship forming bond doesn't happen so easily (if at all).  Blizzard want Wow Classic players to make lasting friendships just as they did back in vanilla so I wouldn't have thought they would be too thrilled about an LFG addon either.
---
Smart move, they kept back the better server names so people will be encouraged to switch lol (If not being able to log in for hours is not encouragement enough)
---
Yeah the big 1k mana dump spell that leaves you completely oom.
---
please, learn in what time zone you are, or typ in google chrome or just in google 03:00 pm PDT and it calculates it to your current time zone - people , its not that hard O\_o
---
Like a rogue. At least if you want DPS gear.
---
F-Key is: Holy Light (Healing Touch/Rip/Swipe, Chain Heal, Multi Shot, Mind Flay, Drain Life, Frost Nova, Thunder Clap and Garrote/Rupture)
---
But T... T is always /assist ;)
---
Yeah, MrGM was being way too hyperbolic. Completely invalidated any good point he made to me.
---
Not arguing the addon portion, but the last paragraph. What if you just don't care about that stuff? Shouldn't one get to play how they want? I mean, if they miss something big, that's on them, but why police it? It's their money for their subscription, right? Like are you going to quiz your group members if they saw comments 20 minutes ago in trafe, and if they didn't, you put them on ignore?

It's wank
---
One of them goes down, and three more pop up. I'm sure it's incredibly difficult to keep a leash on.
---
There has been talk about character transfers from Blizzard. Unless stated otherwise I would assume it works similar to the transfer today. That includes account transfer of characters registered to the same name.
---
I know right? How are they gonna make Bigglesworth pacific?
---
 Devilsaur Mafia was common during Vanilla WoW. It is not a Pserver thing.
---
As a not-noob hunter, your loss! The amount of times I saved groups by CCing or using my pet as a tank is... a lot.
---
Did you even read my explanation? I would love to move away from the queues but having my original character name is just far more important of a factor to me than having to wait in a queue for the first week.
---
If they want people stuck on these full realms to move and spread the playerbase out more evenly just enable free character transfers for characters already created on full realms to the additional new realms before character creation is enabled and people are able to snipe names again.
---
This gives guilds and friends plenty time to relocate and keep their original names with literally no negatives.
---
Strength and honor!
---
I came to this subreddit now for first time and holy absolute shit what a shitshow it has been. Do these people have nothing important to cry about in their lives, if this is the most horrible thing in their lives they have some serious issues.
---
I remember using CallToArms, which was similar addon and I did not see this kind of shitshow back then, nor did anyone receive pitchfork gang coming after them for using it. Mob mentality these days, geez its terrifying.
---
I will use this addon, like I used CTA, I've already experienced Vanilla to its fullest extent once, and I will choose the way I play Classic and not let mental-mob do it for me.
---
These people need to calm the fuck down.
---
*cough*
---
&gt;Don't like full time healing
---
Its performance might be top-notch but playstyle, grouping and everything else is meh *for me*. It is simply not my cup of tea, and it's a big thing when the very first things you value are class fantasy and an enjoyable playstyle, the latter being the tricky one since I enjoy very specific stuff and a role that's been ignored by many games.
---
And who are you to dictate how someone plays the game?
---
Maybe they upped the drop rate cuz it was just outright dumb before? That'd be nice if so.
---
This is objectively false. Night elves can do a flip when the jump. Dwarves cannot. Have you ever done a flip while unsheathing your weapons?
---
I mean, do you really expect to get a Soul Fire off against any class ever? Even spec'd it's 4 sec. And even hunters have interrupts.
---
MC wow such fun.
---
I'm on the East coast and was super set on rolling on an EST realm, but Bigglesworth has me seriously reconsidering lol
---
I'm with you. I'm swapping and 90% for the name.
---
Ummm, I think it’s more that no one needs to regen health in retail anymore.  So no one knows if it’s there or not.
---
Cheeky request - is it possible to get a non-WoW CSS over the page? I'd love to read through this at work during the days after releases but it's obviously not work related. Even just disabling the background/header? I'm not tech enough to be able to do it through the dev console!
---
I believe full was around 4k, can't be bothered to find the source though.
---
If you let program do something for you, it's essential playing for you. Even if it's something as simple as spamming lfg, it just takes away the interraction part of the game, even if it is by very small margain. Before you know one thing leads to another and this addon will be doing even more things for you. It's easy to see why its not a problem because it looks so innocent.
---
Join the Skeram Harem! (If US based) 
---
My suggestion for a new player is not to use a quest addon (that gives you the arrow directing on rails mentality). The quests in classic will need to be figured out by reading the quest text which gives some basic direction.
---
The basic format however is talk to X, Collect X, Kill X. If you read the quest text however, there is some very interesting story lines going on in each zone.
---
death sentence, aka retail for life !
---
that the worst analogy ive ever heard
---
I have  a few months off thanks to someone hitting me with their car, so I have physio to do on breaks, premade food from the gym I go to and most importantly I'll be exercising on loadscreens to stay alert and stay healthy.

you have 32,000 members? And that's just Goons. Mango and Frat throw another several thousand into the mix.
---
They did not have WotLK era lfg in the beta or any of the demos/announcements. What are you going on about?
---
Laughed out loud
---
What is this community. Ironically the less time to actual Classic and more good news we get about it, the more malding i see on this sub lol.  
---
How does this work exactly? Whats wrong with your lives to spread more negativity when more good news you get?
---
So I have a good friend who I didn’t know would be playing Classic who has ruined all of my plans... I was completely certain I was going to continue playing a Dwarf Priest, and have read numerous guides in preparation. Problem is my friend is going Horde...
---
Now I feel like I’m doing a disservice to my character to just switch from Alliance to Horde- so I’m going to level the Dwarf Priest when my friend is not online. However, that leaves the question of the Horde character. 
---
I still have no idea which class I’m choosing. Currently leaning towards Mage or Shaman- but to be honest, it’s probably going to be a complete impulse decision on the day...
---
its an ADDON
---
I don't see them going that far unless the expansion comes with some major bonuses to the classic realms like allowing access to Classic TBC, or Classic+ content.  That is something I could see myself paying for, but it won't go over well if they expect players to buy an expansion for a solved 15+ year old game that doesn't get any new content.
---
It's not just about "back in mah day". It's about competence. Who's able to make changes/additions to wow classic without fucking it up?
---
Don't mean to flame the dev team but they did ruin retail. They butchered it. And the community? We pretty much asked for it.
---
At this point I don't trust anyone with those decisions anymore.
---
Yap he is god I guess 😇
---
I'd rather have the addon for those that want to use it than trade chat being spammed
---
Stranglethorn looooove, o-ee-o-ee-ooo
---
Nah, they should require wowhead to run the thottbot theme as default for all classic players!
---
you can't silence thottbot
---
Good lord, you took them down far better than I ever I could. Thank you.

shhhh they will push to have warlock removed from the game

---
Well it obviously depend of the situation but most of the time it's either dot cc and searing pain/shadow bolt spam
---
Yeah fair point on the fact the game is miles easier. Skill &gt; gear as the game is easy and all you need to do is follow simple instructions to do the raids/dungeons. Still my point stands?
---
&gt;just enable free character transfers for characters already created on full realms to the additional new realms before character creation is enabled and people are able to snipe names again.
---
Perfectly reasonable, but won't happen.
---
Then there is no reason for people to join either server because they don't have a chance at their name.
---
People simply have a choice to make.
---
Wait in 8 hour queues every single day during launch week.
---
Or.
---
Create characters on one of the lower pop or new realms.
---
Then it's fair for everyone.
---
Thottbot was launched in 2001, before WoW even released to the public. There has pretty much always been *some* way to look up something if you're stuck. I completely agree that it is great to have players helping players, but saying that this shouldn't exist just isn't reasonable.
---
"Cya on the otherside guys"
---
Which becomes MANDATORY after enough pressure. We hated gearscore, it was an addon, and literally everyoen fucking used it in wotlk.
---
Lol Eve doesn't have layering like WoW classic will at launch.

**Biggles**
---
James Bigglesworth, nicknamed "Biggles", is a fictional pilot and adventurer, the title character and hero of the Biggles series of adventure books, written for young readers by W. E. Johns (1893–1968). Biggles made his first appearance in the story The White Fokker, published in the first issue of Popular Flying magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, The Camels Are Coming (both 1932). Johns continued to write "Biggles books" until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time.

Warrior/Paladin equally OP. (Plus might buff)
---
&gt;they said they will remove any addon that goes against the philosophy of Classic WoW
---
So this addon will stay, call to arms existed, aswell as automatic group cretion through the meeting stones and innkeepers.
---
&gt;This addon does barely anything to change how easy it is (or not, to be more accurate) to actually get a new player
---
Then why would you use it if it barely changes anything?
---
To me it feels like a lot of people that are coming for classic (at least on this subreddit) are adults not having much time to play, and they need conveniences like that to be able experience content. Some of them would like to be able to find people faster. Some would like to teleport to the dungeon on top of that. Some would like heirlooms on top of that to make leveling faster to experience end game content. And so on...
---
It really is a slippery slope.
---
Of course not. All 32k of them arent going to roll there, nor are they going to be able to all be online at the same time. I'm sure all the other Fairbanks guilds will want to know about this mess, and then form something to help stop it.
---
Has there been more already? I mean. Gold sellerd and grinders have always been a thing. I'm not expecting them to crack down on all of them.
---
But blatantly advertising on YouTube... Thats kindda seems like in your face kinda shit you know?

You shouldn't need a study to tell you sitting in a chair for many hours in a day, while staring at a screen all day and night isn't healthy. Which is something kids could do because they don't want to go to bed.
---
Do you need studies to tell you fire is hot?
---
I agree on the PvP front for Paladins, but I thought Paladins made raiding easier for more casual guilds, but skilled Shamans/top-tier guilds got more use out of Shamans than they do Paladins.

Resto druid yo
---
Good thing LFG and dungeon finders are two completely different things.
---
What if they only eat brown rice?
---
It just so happens that I am between jobs right now. I don't start my new job until exactly one week after Classic launches. So I'll be going mega no-life mode for those seven days.
---
Haven't thought specifically about snacks and exercise, but probably a half hour walk once a day plus periodic five minute stretch breaks. For food I'll probably just mostly live off delivery...
---
What people miss is having to actually meet up at the dungeon and seeing the same people again and again. A group finder doesn't change that in classic.

Gearscore doesnt matter in Vanilla no matter which way you put it. You have to be absolutely clueless about how the game works to think so and everyone is going to think youre an idiot for thinking so.
---
&gt; There's a reason that the game--at least when it was good--made a conscious decision to separate combat rewards from non combat rewards.
---
Yeah but retail is not like this anymore? Retail has evolved into a commercial playground where accessibility is everything. I dont agree with much that has shaped retail but this is not the core of my discussion, its what bring prestige and what is not.
---
&gt; If you didn't actually kill something to get there, it's not really prestigious.
---
Prestigious is highly subjective, so i understand why you think this way, but i dont. 
---
&gt; Anyone can just buy gold.
---
Yes i know, which is why i said:
---
"(Now, i dont think that the gold part is as prestigious as getting it back in naxx40 ofcource, since you can just buy the gold with WoW tokens if you want, but thats a different conversaion.)" in my last reply.
---
I think the prestige of BMAH items has sunk greatly after the addition of WoW-token since you can just buy your way there. But if you earned all the gold to buy it, i can see prestige in that, but again, what is prestigious and what is not is hightly subjective, so nothing is right or wrong, its up to the individual. 
---
Do i think that earning it back in vanilla is more prestigious than buying it of the BMAH? Of course.
---
I had time between jobs already and I didn’t spend it playing video games (ok, maybe I did a little. I jammed the test for at least a full day :P).

No reason why you can’t let go of it cleanly, you can still play a couple of hours a day.

Yeah I agree. Still wanted to know why ppl. have a Problem with the addon ?

Thank you!
---
&gt;Actually, you never asked me a question, 
---
You are correct, "him" is the OP
---
&gt;limiting screen time? why? 
---
Once again, I didn't say limiting screentime is wrong.  None of you can follow a conversation.  plz read
---
Unfortunately not :-(
---
Have to admit, our blocker at work sometimes is a bit too enthusiastic.

Because when servers start to die there will be mergers and / or transfers available. And at least you'd have leveled in peace.

---
It’s not misinformation whatsoever. I didn’t hate on anything. I said to play whatever would be most fun. 
---
Druid dps and tank are bad relative to other classes. That’s a fact. Idk why that makes you so salty. Will a Druid be able to main tank a raid phase 1 without a group of either extremely experienced or mostly BiS players? No. 
---
Is a Druid dps gonna top charts? No. 
---
Maybe that’s not somebody’s goal and I encouraged him to choose whatever he’d have more fun with. You don’t have to be so salty.
---
Considering how careful they are being about releasing new realms it is likely that only the last few realms released will possibly get screwed with a small pop.  All currently released realms should be fine.  Depending on how many new subs on launch day then Monday's new servers might be fine too.
---
Hunters actually use melee a lot though. Raptor strike, Wingclip, people just rushing you, etc.
---
A melee weapon for a hunter is infinitely more useful than a ranged weapon for a warrior. Even in PvE!
---
Cause the addon literally said 'vQueue' in the whispers it spammed around?
---
Transferring characters from one [battle.net](https://battle.net) account to another isn't allowed.
---
A week ago I was addicted to Fallout 76. Then Bethesda released their raid and I re-subbed to WoW specifically only for classic. Won't be touching that garbage fire anymore.
---
I had no idea launch was next week so my hype has been incredibly fast to build over the past few days.
---
Agreed, I'll be moving too. Great name.
---
Once and its default until you change it again.
---
I honestly didn't mind dungeon finder for the sole reason of being able to queue while questing as a DPS and then getting a free tele to the dungeon.
---
I definitely wouldn't want anything like that for raiding though. I enjoyed having my main raiding group or just scanning the chat while at max level and seeing who was trying to fill an extra spot.
---
Gladly, talking to a self absorbed brick wall with no backup to their claims or experience in the matter is getting me no where. Friendly advice though, practice what you preach. If you can't practice it, don't preach it. Rather, if you can't back up your own claims but someone else can, don't get butt hurt.
---
 "We know that once it's out there, saying 'just don't use it' isn't good enough because it will start to become part of the fabric." Bear in mind this stance appears to only be regarding social aspects of the game rather than class performance etc.
---
That is from Ion Hazzikostas even the lead devs understand that over time the addon is quite literally forced on you to even play withothers.
---
As a horde rogue this makes me happy.

oh the joys of alt+tabbing to figure out where the mobs were :P
---
Funnily enough I've started an intense death anxiety in the past few days and it's ruining what extreme hype I had. In fact it's ruining me
---
Doot doo!
---
No one even uses call to arms and its an extremely efficient group finder.
---
Oh i see your attitude now.

my "claim" is that I haven't seen a good study saying screen time is bad.  you are determined to make that mean that my claim is that screen time isn't bad.  you're actually an idiot I'm blocking you now.  bye
---
joking aside, and know my opinion will be dropped to the pits of hell as there is a lot of circle jerking here. but i don't get the hate for retail. if retail fails and they pull the plug on it one of 2 things will happen, 1 classic dies and they focus on other financial ventures as a company, like it or not after the first year or so classic will only have hardcore classic players on it or people that are on there between playing on retail so wouldn't be generating that much income. or 2 they close down retail as it is and work on redoing it using classic as a diving board to start again at which point we will get all the whiny brats that messed up retail coming to mess up classic, i love the idea of classic as we all want it but i don't think it will be what we want it to be if retail suddenly dies.
---
!RemindMe 1 day
---
Game doesnt even have bis guns anyway
---
Massive failure imo
---
So like, I'm off tomorrow, and planning to play it all day. Is this gonna be one of those things where it says it's released tomorrow but doesn't actually come out until Wednesday?
---
Cos if so Imma be sad.
---
I love it how they first scammed people to buy gametime to reserve names and then they keep adding new ones.
---
even if they did this you'd have no guarantee that one of the people who snatched your name on another server wouldn't transfer faster. or maybe that would happen to one of your friends.
---
there's a solution to this that probably won't work for you: get over it. it's just a name. make a new one. one that isn't already being used by a bunch of others. 
---
Or wait in q.
---
How.
---
Times change ..... This was not our destiny
---
But as you say once you hit 60 warrior/ paladin is prolly the best duo
---
&lt;don't kill me pls&gt; If people want to do this with an addon. I really don't care and will probably install it aswell. The old Raidfinder UI in MoP where you could list your pugs and had to manually apply and accept was pretty dope.
---
I've been doing long leveling sessions for every expansion since Cataclysm and will be doing the same for the classic launch.
---
As for food preparations, I will be meal prepping on the weekend and Monday morning so I don't have to take time off to cook something and can just pop it in the microwave during times where you can go afk (flight master, craft bandages etc)
---
I will cut up a lot of veggies (cucumbers, carrots, radish, turnip etc) and put them in a tupperware and will eat them with hummus throughout the leveling. I've opted for healthier snacks now that I've gotten older, junk food and the likes will drain my energy and make me tired. If you have watermelons available in your area, get some. They're a healthy snack and hydrating but can be a bit messy so I suggest cutting them up and eating them with a fork or keeping a napkin at your side.
---
For the "main course" I will be making chicken pad thai and broccoli and chicken breast. I will, however, allow myself to have some soda but will try to drink mostly water. In case I feel tired and need an energy boost, I will opt for the acao energy drink, it's a healthier option as far as energy drinks go and doesn't make me feel like I'm suffering a heart attack. 
---
Also: buy some gum. It helps you stay focused longer. 
---
My house is cleaned, laundry done and I have the week off and I'm excited for the launch day.
---
I doubt you'll be able to stop that. Besides, where is the problem with that as long as it doesn't automatically match people? I'd really like some "pinboard" kind of group finder addon, so I don't have to idle in Orgrimmar ...
---
Say what? Enchanting was trash for gold making. Everyone gives free enchants to try and level up, there is no vellums and in my experience due to each guild having about 60 people in, someone would inevitably do it for free.
---
Adding in vellums is one of the few things I would not be against. Nothing more fun than spamming trade chat to try and make 2g selling a chest enchant
---
Something is better than nothing.
---

Why stop here ? Meth was used by the army for long missions !

You could have done it with the old character models :)
---
I'm not talking about the dungeon finder, I'm talking about the LFG tool. The LFG tool does not teleport you to the instance either and yet removes huge parts of the social aspect.
---
That seriously is the dream and I've convinced my GF to play Human Mage instead of Nelf Priest. What have I done? :O
---
Guys. plz help) I didn't but ratail wow so what i need in order to start playing on classic? Do i need to buy latest version of retail wow + the subscription? Or i can buy only subscription?
---
don't have to. You're right
---
Welp I used to aim shot critahes for 2500-2700 with my headed lvl 60 in warsong and alterac :)
---
Great stuff, thanks! Will definitely use this while leveling for reference.
---
It's been around pserver for years its called call to arms and I'm always the only one even trying to use it lmao... It's just like I check it and my lfg from 9 days ago Is still there ....
---
"The addon allows you to find replacements without leaving the dungeon"
---
How though? The addon doesn't magically create new players to join your group and summon them there. Even without addons "/join world" will be used by everyone so finding people from inside a dungeon still requires the same amount of waiting. The addon simply reduces "effort required" in the same way that creating a macro that writes "/5 LF1M DPS SFK" for you does.
---
You still have to find a player who's willing and able to fill the role, talk to the player and inform him that "we killed the first 2 bosses and X person left the group", wait for the player to travel there, most likely go out and help the lone player get inside by clearing all the mob packs unless it's a dungeon that's easy to get inside of etc. The biggest difference is that it allows people to focus on something else like questing while still making sure they're not missing LFG messages in world chat. In that sense, sure.. it indirectly makes it easier to fill a group by making it harder to miss players.
---
If anyone hasn't used them before, from my experience the addons can be summarized as a simple chat-filter all the other functions are gimmicky and unnecessary like a UI button for whispering people instead of right-click whispering or having DPS/Tank/Heal be displayed with a little image. You're going to read the message and see what it says anyway so it's just fancy UI nonsense. The main function is: it filters and seperates keywords that you're looking for like: "LFG/LFM/LF3M" "WC/Wailing/Cavern" and stores those messages which means you can look at them periodically instead of gluing your eyes to the chat. It's the equivalent of creating an IRC chat room with categories like "deadmines" "blackfathom deeps" etc. It removes the messages that you don't want to see and from my experience at least, it doesn't change the "feel" and experience of forming a group at all. It doesn't all of a sudden change the fact that doing SFK is difficult as a lvl 23 alliance player with no flightpaths to Hillsbrad. I have no idea if all the players I played on with private servers used the addon or if I was the only one using it, you still go through the same "steps" socially when forming a group.
---
Try hard virgins at its best. Its a shame so many people need to attempt to spoil what was a fucking awesome experience back in 2004-6, wankers.
---
I'd love to see him play a real gnome in the Warcraft movie, alas that wasn't meant to be.
---
This is literally just pasting the Classic logo onto a parrot.
---
I would say low effort, but it's less than that.
---
No.
---
People beg for lots of things. Hindsight is 20/20. They can't just make decisions that could potentially fuck up server pops based on the hunches of players on Reddit and forums. They made a conservative estimate and that's 100% what they should have done. Anyway you'll be fine, they know what they're doing and they're adding a small new window where you can reserve more names. It's the smartest thing they could have done and it'll prevent a lot of the queue issues at launch since people will decide to move to the new servers since they have more reservations available.
---
Latency won't matter,  I used to play Pacific in vanilla from Florida.  That being said,  raids will kick off at 8pm est and you will still be parked on the405 on your way home from work/school at that time. So that will limit your choice of guilds to the " we start raiding at 11pm or midnight est guilds " which are constantly starved for new players.
---
Warwick has his own TV show in the UK
---
Yes, the industry changed in the sense that everything is driven by profit nowadays, no room anymore for passion, especially for publicly traded companies.
---
What didn't change is customer demand for decent games to play, I think this is what the person you answered meant.
---
Customer side, what also changed IMO is what I call the massification of things that drive down quality. Back then gaming was considered a nerds exclusive and MMOs were a really niche genre.
---
Today every granma and their dogs have devices they can play games with but they're not actually gamers (in the "veteran" sense of the word). They can generate huge profits but not loyalty to something well done.
---
I think this is what can make companies think there's no demand anymore for quality producs, but only quick gains and convenience, Classic is proving them wrong.
---
1. Yeah you say that, but you don't really have anything to back that up except "we used to wear fire resist gear so we have to wear fire resist gear".
---
2. Go watch a fucking video. Mages are wearing tier 0 and shit all round. This is consistent across all the videos I've been able to find, people didn't know what was good when they zoned in. On top of that, 90% of tanks were crap, which threat caps threat dependent classes, which means slower kills, which means more damage taken which means more healing needed, which means resist gear becomes neccesary. If you're already threat capped, wearing resist gear represents no dps loss, so you should.
---
3. You're just talking about random shit at this point. I've never said you could use 6 healers in classic, what I said was that killing things faster means you can not have as many healers. The equivalent to swapping from 3/20 healers to 2/20 healers for more dps on live, is the equivalent of going from resist gear on dps to full dps gear in classic.
---
But obviously, to play classic you have to walk uphill both directions in the snow.
---
What an absolute mess this is, just after the server poll =/
---
He's not talking about a summoning stone, warlocks cant summon in an instance
---
Raid attunement would be pointless otherwise
---
it's just weed. It will never lead to heroin :D
---
Lost me on fellow horde.. heheh. 
---
I've got to work sadly. No more Uni for me. Working man now..
---
this item is really for a feral offtank for a threat intensive fight like broodlord imo; feral dps isn't really viable in vanilla even if you have enough of these to use on cooldown for the entire raid
---
I don't think you people who are bandwagoning against this understand how god damn successful and huge classic WoW is going to be. You will not be able to spam /2 looking for a group, because people will not be able to read your chat, as it disappeared off the screen in under a second. Imagine looking at a popular Twitch streamer's chat while they're streaming. /2 will look a hell of a lot like that, even if there's less people saying Kappa and omegaLUL. 
---
You quite simply will not be able to read /2 except during off-peak middle of the night hours, until several months after release when the game has died off enough to where there's perhaps 5 to 6000 people per faction on your server during primetime. Even then, you are dealing with a global LFG chat channel that is scrolling more than twice as fast as it was during vanilla, because LFG chat will be accessible from any zone, and not just to the people sitting on the bank steps in your favorite capital city.
---
Imagine caring about using shoulder pads as a status symbol.
---
Sounds like you have an inferiority complex and need to show off how awesome you are because you need that kind of validation.
---
I thought this was one of those myths that wasn't true
---
(All of us come Monday.)[https://youtu.be/KqRPOEa3P44]
---
See this is the issue. You don't even try to aknowledge the problem.  
---
Gearscore wasn't fine. It also made any sort of interraction less human. Many people that were less geared could perform better than better geared players and were excluded because of benchmarks.  
---
And please stop. Of course there are "mandatory" addons. Not in the literal sense, but if you're playing the game long enough and want to progress in some direction you will need it. That's the point.  
---
 Addons like these also diminish other design principles and quirks of the original game that actually made the community what it was.
---
Some people just have too much time and they are wasting on such crap.
---
Stalagg?
---
I respect each and everyone of you horde, but that doesn't mean I'll hold back...😈
---
As opposed to all the Alliance shamans in vanilla...
---
That 15% doesnt really make up for it tho
---
But it boosts warlock epeen
---
I am sticking to what I said earlier. If the idea of LW appeals to you then go ahead and do it. That is great. However if your goal is to min-max you will want engineering.
---
I can't rely on the AH in a fresh economy, that's the whole point of the question..
---
Beta is over, no point signing up to it. And if it wasn't over, you wouldn't instantly get an invite to it.
---
You can buy a wow subscription, this allows you to download classic and reserve names.
---
Incorrect way of saying "/w" or "/w me", which I saw used during vanilla-wotlk, instead of the modern "pst". no-changes amirite?
---
I mean I knew that by heart after a while but yeah, my first character I legit just read the quest log and thotbotted it if I couldn't find it myself.
---
Yes.
---
So 'Fairbanks' will be the most dishonest server name then
---
Well if memory serves right this was actually a thing in Classic, I distinctly remember temporarily trying something in the spirit of multiboxing with my and my mothers account in early TBC (spoiler alert it didn't go well :P) so I don't see how doing something that was also done back then is "against the design principles of classic" since it was bannable then and it isn't bannable now.
---
And once again to my understanding it's anything but trivializing group content, I mean if 1 person can control 5 character better than a 5 people can, either that person is way awesome or the other 5 are completely useless. I mean, imagine trying to play two different classes at the same time just trying to kill something... let alone tank, heal and dps at the same time while also dealing with other mechanics for 5 different toons.
---
I'd really want some actual input from those that see this negatively as I am kinda biased positively towards multiboxing
---
Add-on creators HATE him!!
---
The strategy is pretty much just natural commitments in life. 15 years ago I "only" had school to worry about, even though I still managed to skip a lot of it to play videogames. All of my friends played WoW back then so our social bonds were, and still are, strong because of it. Nowadays I have work which includes a fair bit of travel, relationships and hobbies. The only thing I see changing is that Classic will take over much if not all of my hobby-time, which is nice. I love to just go all in on a hobby and immerse myself in it, but I will never let it become as consuming as it was when I was a 14yo kid with nothing else going on in life.   
---
Will I spend most of my spare time playing WoW Classic and probably stay up way too late to play? Yes, as long as I find it rewarding and fun. Will I skip work, gym or real life obligations to play the game like I used to? Not a chance. We can (and should) have the best of both worlds.  
---
Let someone else do the scouting, we're not 14 anymore!
---
I second #4, Just leveled 1-60 with the wife on a pserver. Now she’s joining me for release 👍
---
Eh? If they try it they will be banned. Cross-faction collusion is forbidden and bannable. Doing it through in-game addon is just provoking the banhammer.
---
I have no plans because I never got a chance to play classic before. I mean, I've done *some* zones. The starting ones, mostly. But, I haven't even killed, or been killed *by* hogger. Beyond that, a class and spec I've never played - my gnome mage and I are going to go on a very long journey, all around the world.
---
Beyond that basic idea, all I can say is I'm going to level the professions I learn, and just get out there and do things. I have no idea what I'm going to be doing, and I can't wait to start doing it.
---
3,5k i believe
---
Luffa is badass though
---
Yeah - the pace of peo around acts 7/8 is how fast we should be moving through the game. Then things like vaal ice nova or vaal spark that delete the screen wouldn’t seem overly busted or chain through most of a map.
---
Now that I think about it, most of my favorite rpgs all had midly slow progression.
---
Phantasy Star Online 2 - great game and wasnt fast at all. Vanilla - great game wasnt fast. Tempest league Poe, wasn’t super fast.
---
You're implying that one person controls 5 characters. They don't. They either have an optimized keyboard setup where they literally press 1-2-3-4-5 in order and the toons execute it, or they have keystroke capture which replicates their own keystrokes that result in 5 characters doing the same thing.  
---
 It does trivialize the leveling in the cases where a warrior could fight like a warlock, having his personal tank and healer. Having a priest /follow and literally tapping one key to make him cast heal doesn't really seem like that much of a high skill ceiling.    
---
    
---
The thing is, I don't really care. If someone want's to do it then fine, I find it stupid. The only real negative side to it that I can find is that it makes farming gold easier for a single player and it's extremely immersionbreaking.
---
Isn't TF a Hunter weapon?
---
Yep I see it filling up quick.
---
Or just a really boring one
---
You can register for a trial, log in with your [battle.net](https://battle.net) account and you can install the WoW Classic client from then.
---
Retail bad. booooo!
---
Group finder didnt even change that until its second iteration after wrath. The original group finder was still restricted to your server and forced you to travel to a dungeon. 
---
The real change came when crossrealm became a thing
---
one less spot in the queue boys!
---
&gt;Not sure what obsessive gaming even means
---
cmon man don't play this game. not a good look. you know fucking well people get obsessed/addicted to gaming. There's a WHOLE market for it (loot boxes, mobile gaming, P2W). Just stop.
---
druid.  glorious class
---
Heeelll no to dungeon finder.
---
Just go pick the flowers when you want to. They won't get em all
---
The second someone asks for item level in Vanilla they're straight up landing on my block list
---
I don't see how this would change any of that. I met people in other states that I have met IRL multiple times through wow. In legion. Using LFR. I really don't see an issue most of the stuff people say makes retail bad. I think people that havent played wow since bc or wotlk like to bitch about things they have never experienced and assume are bad.
---
What is it, 4 days now? We almost made it boys!
---
Would be cool to get an indicator or dropdown menu for each quest on hiw long the chains are and which items you'll get or even exp for the whole chain
---
Would be interesting for a lot of dungeon leveling groups
---
Ofcourse no solution is perfect but I suggested only the *full* realms to be enabled with the free transfers as it stands that is only golemagg and shazzrah on EU. Therefore that is only 1 other person potentially using the same name, honestly they could just enable it for shazzrah it seems to be the one that is grossly overpopulated.
---
Like I said no solution is perfect but this would actually work for a lot of people and help spread the population out rather than just removing the character creation cap which really isn't helping any of the players stuck in this same issue I am.
---
I agree that many addons throughout the lifespan of WoW has diminished its quality as a game. But where do you draw the line? LFG add-on? Questie? DBM? Recount? Swing timer? Auctioneer? Which add-ons are ok and which ones isn't? Blizzard has a couple of times blocked API to prevent add-ons from working, and I am not entirely against the idea of having a discussion which kinds of add-ons should be blocked in Classic.
---
Is how it is man.
---
they can't but its not needed for T1 content anyway
---
That doesnt include these new servers :(
---
^ full of 💩no one logs out angry these days or old days they just leave or corpse rez away.
---
Only because they weren't in vanilla. No changes, remember?
---
people have a lot of double standards when it comes to gaming.  if you give me specifics I'll let you know if I think you're an idiot.
---
I stopped reading at "niche"
---
Which no one used
---
That damn creeper ichor. I don't think I got this in less than like 30 kills on any character, usually more like 100.
---
Yeah this look right ... now reduce polygons and textures by 15 years and taste the Vanilla
---
The amount of hypocrisy in this thread is absolutely mind boggling.
---
They REALLY thought that we think we do but we dont
---
Woah well then even low gonna look very healthy looking
---
on 3.5 u see people everywhere and the cities are really packed
---
&gt; But in Vanilla, aside from Naxx/AQ40surely player skill is massively more important than their gear.
---
I highly disagree, lets not pretend vanilla is some extremely hard high skill cap game. It's a long grind, not a hard grind. Majority of classes have a 1-2 button rotation. I would easily take a mage with full pre-raid bis over a mage with lvling greens/blues, it doesn't matter how bad that mage is he will always out the dps other mage unless he simply isn't pressing frostbolt for some unknown reason.
---
I love Vanilla as much as the next guy, but saying it's a game that needs skill is just a lie, vanilla is a game that rewards knowledge. Let's be real MC bosses are probably equally as difficult as LFR is in live, with maybe a couple of the bosses being equal to a normal boss in terms of difficulty.
---
There really aren't disadvantages besides the time spent travelling there and the lost rep for a mount discount unless you go to a location, where your class isn't present and as such you have no class trainers.
---
So:
---
* Paladin in the night elf area
---
* Shaman in the undead area
---
* Hunter in the human or undead area
---
* Druid anywhere but night elf or tauren areas
---
* Rogue in tauren area
---
* Mage in night elf or tauren area
---
* Warlock in night elf or tauren area
---
* Priest in tauren area
---
Druid was amazing fun to level.
---
You dont reserve names in beta.
---
Launch World of Warcraft classic and create a character
---
You need to have an active subscription
---
With the German, French and Russian we have 12 PvP servers
---
Honestly whatever you enjoy the most is the answer.    
---
That being said, I leveled a warrior in vanilla once and only once
---
Californian rolling grobbulus here. Planning on rolling alliance! Check out r/grobbulus, lots of fun guys there and feel free to dm me too ^^
---
Thanks for the advice. I played GW2 for a bit and did exactly the same with my keybindings and actually bound the dodge roll to the V key so that I could hit it with my thumb quickly. 
---
So you mean I should join a PvP server? How does the PvP work in this game? Do you get a choice if you fight them or not?
---
I mean, there are 2nd Servers for germany. 2x PvE, 2x PvP. Blizzard listed the European Realms that are far too full and didn't list the german ones. I don't see the problem in switching Servers or starting on the lower pop Realm atm. All 4 of these are going to be full at Release, possibly even a 3rd wave.
---
Even if your numbers are just assumptive, it still makes sense. Look at how subs go down 2-3 months after each Addon Release in the past years since we reached peak in Wrath. They already said 1 Layer = 1 Server and a full Server will have multiple Layers. So if as you say 1 Server would hold 5-10k after Layering is removed (I think that's what you mean with "an the end" - correct me if I'm wrong) then they already expect at least 10k-20k who stay (excluding RP Servers) - which means if we have a Drop of 50% in Playerbase they at least expect 20k-40k german Players at the start (because I don't want to Assume more than 2 Layers as I don't know their numbers).
---
Dude... Nice!
---
9/26/2019 - 3.00pm PDT is the official release....
---
Well then it's sad since I will be working 6 hours more after the servers have opened up for new name reserve and I will miss that chance.
---
More like Pass at switching servers. I'm staying where my reserved names are.
---
Why are you wasting your time explaining yourself to this brain dead zoomer? He doesn't understand what you're talking about because he's not an adult.
---
As I recall it, yes that's how it worked.
---
&gt; Teleporting to instances didn't help destroy the worldfeel of the "world" of warcraft?
---
Wrath baby spotted (or later expansions, I don't care)
---
You clearly can't distinguish LFG from LFD.
---
Grade A+ shit posting
---
Hopefully miss delete this sooner than later and ban this goof.
---
That is some valuable data i didnt know of. I will definitely take it into consideration and test it out 😁👍🏻 I would take more dmg without holy shield tho, but what in the "long" end?
---
No need to jump on Firemaw as they will open new servers on Monday. If I'd change servers now, I'd wait some more for the four new ones. Leave my dragon on medium! D:
---
Ofc the Bindings, probably even the Quest. But you need to enter BWL anyways. BWL is P3.
---
In live it is so long as you own both accounts. I've done it before.
---
Whether or not they'll let you do it in Classic is the question. I'm curious to find out myself.
---
By the way, OP. I'm doing the same thing! I'm going to be focusing on my warrior but I'll have another character going at the same time. I probably won't level WITH my warrior, but I'll level the other toon up casually when there's downtime on my main.
---
Nobody trades through the chat channels in PoE. There's scammers trying to get newbies to buy their overpriced items. People who played for kore than 50 hours use one of the trade websites.
---
Well EU is the biggest playerbase.

Getting dal’rends is going to be a nightmare

maybe the rogue is dagger spec at least

Some are on their way home, some like myself are starting a brand new journey.
---
Rather spit on the coffin, than give my F
---
I bow in your ultimate wisdom. You still don’t seem to get it. It’s not about if there is a correct amount of servers at the correct second in time. Blizzard doesn’t have the same goals as you do. You don’t understand marketing - thats #1. No one here does. And if something just goes the slightest wrong people are clueless because you think its always a worst case scenario because booohew blizzard has fucked up in the past. What if they haven’t? What if its the best case scenario given the circumstances? 
---
Tldr; this sub-reddit is a bunch of hobos in their moms basement thinking they know everything about running a company, developing software and doing successful product launches. While in reality the only place you’ve been mildly successful is in WoW.

I'm very glad then we got an additional pvp server with German language.
---
I've absolutely never had any issues finding a group the normal way, but maybe it's because i was the tank.
---
Really? Nobody used it, like, ever, man?
---
It could most definitely "work".  In that with a database of available items the addon can produce quite an accurate summary of where a character stands as far as gear.
---
Where it doesn't work in classic will be in practice.  It takes a lot of time to get to the dungeons.  Time that cannot be spent swapping players out who don't meet an itemlevel or gearscore requirement.
---
The only place an addon like this would be remotely useful would be in 5-man dungeon or MC pugs, maybe ZG eventually.  I would argue that even ZG can be completed by a group in full Tier 0 dungeon sets.  All the rest of the content can be done quite easily by any group with even the most basic level 60 gear.
---
When the ceiling is that low all the effort will go into making groups and getting to the dungeon.  There just won't be the need for gearscore.
---
The addon creator already announced that autoinvite wont be a feature in the classic version. 
---
Global lfg was a thing in vanilla, and before that there were tricks that let you join another zones chat.    I know I didn't waste my time sitting in IF with these lazy fucks who are begging for #changes to ban addons thst existed in vanilla
---
I always just grind those while doing other quests.
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
Isn’t this why ppl wanted classic wow to get away from things like this?? It’s madness that it’s even been given air time.
---
hunter/druid definitely. Warlock is ok killing stuff but slow running 20-40 is zzz.
---
The warriors really bring this onto themselves, therefore my pity is limited.
---
You don't need a tank spec, you don't need a very elaborated tank gear for dungeons. You just need the basic skill of tanking which you have to acquire later for raid OTing anyways (corehound packs, majordomus warriors etc.).
---
If anything one should pity rogues, because they can't tank at all and still have to put up with a plethora of melees rolling on their shit. 
---
A warrior unwilling to tank frankly just plays the wrong class, because tanking is part of the toolkit a fury warrior is expected to bring to raids. 
---
Don't want to tank? Don't play a warrior.
---
try chrome remote desktop on your phone, you can type and left click which should be enough to grab a name
---
Kid you're not gonna trick me into a pointless argument over common sense things like you did the other guy. GL son
---
Also firemaw.
---
Yeah and seeing how many people here so zealously defend this bullshit and even attack others over it is why I don't even wanna play Classic anymore.
---
These fucking zoomers, retail babies and Fortnite brats will just ruin our fond memories of what Vanilla was. We are all better served waiting until this project gets killed by those babies who turn it into 2.0 and then just play pservers again.
---
why did you even comment?
---
It's 230am right now, and I've a night seciry guard job. All I do is patrol in the company vehicle, I'm quite bored in between. This helps kill time.
---
Yup, I premade my char on a pserver, took a photo, held it next to the monitor and quickly went throught the DELETE, CREATE, CUSTOMIZE, FINISH motions...took about 30 seconds total.
---
Holy shiit this is pathetic, im done.
---
I'm jelly that US got bigglesworth lol
---
Imagine being this delusional lmao. They were clearly clueless. Pretty much everyone knew 2 english PvP servers was a joke. It was never ever going to be enough. They could make the game buy to play in addition to sub and it would still need way more than 2 servers.
---
This might be the most retarded thing I've heard this entire year.
---
Definitely. The first time is always the best, and Classic is the perfect opportunity. Sub for a month and try it out and see if you like it
---
3 days, 12 hours, 24 minutes.
---
It's so close...
---
F is for sunder armor ...
---
RIP Classic Winds.
---
I think classic wow is normie enough that even if your mmo experience is modern you can get used to classic.  if you don't give a shit about like learning the fight organically then just google how the fights work and pve your heart out.
---
Okay gotcha! Still, I noticed the difference first hand. And "a bit faster" does not sound like the difference between HDD and SSD loading Screens, at all.
---
26th 6pm for UK
---
I would prefer they didn't stand in shit and kick when required.
---
my F is always execute
---
Pvp gear kind of replaced most of the heroic gear anyway by 2.2.  just people spamming in shat for arena carries after that.  Heroics were meh until the sunwell badge gear came and by then most of the heroics were not difficult.
---
Oh, you sweet, summer child. Bless your heart.
---
Their job is literally trying to estimate this sort of thing though. No matter how you put it, they fucked up big time.
---
Levelling alone as a warrior is more time consuming an requires more planning, so I’d choose rogue
---
The same community in these retarded threads demanding blizzard make changes to ban addons that existed in vanilla?  They can kill it quick enough.
---
Streamer's are probably gonna get special vip queues like every other game.
---
30min max
---
So people on Fairbanks won't play Fair so they can make a Bank? Ironic.
---
Yeah, sounds like you need to train your mods.
---
Omg, Thats my guilds name on stalagg too!
---
So this is what the super virgins look like. LOL. Almost exactly as i imagined.
---
I'm pissed the EU didn't get that - Brits should really have a Biggles server!!!

---
Yeah, in my opinion it was all the little inconveniences about making a group that made you reluctant to change or leave groups. It all encourages more communication.
---
Am I clown? Why should I have funny/meme nickname?
---
If you want the best and smoothest leveling experience, it is hands down the hunter. Their isn't any dispute in this as you have something that can not only hold agrro but also do a fair amount of damage in its own right. 
---
Warlock can also do this to a lesser degree, aswell it has a fantastic class flavor with their quests to tame their demons as they level plus getting their dread steed.
---
Those two I'm sure are the smoothest and most enjoyable due to having their respective pet systems. Besides that I would guess Druids would come third as they have travel and other forms to be useful while in the open world.

 So people on Fairbanks won't play Fair?

The best part of Classic will be that none of the end game content will ever really be truly irrelevant.  Retail has these horrible jumps in ilvl per tier that make getting a group for the first raid of an expac a struggle by the time the last one is released because no one is running it anymore.
---
When AQ and Naxx drop there will still be pleeenty of people going through MC in blues still.
---
Of course he does.
---
She just go to a different school.
---
Frost provides great survivability with frost Nova and slow with frostbolt. Frost also has the ability to AOE farm efficiently
---
Yes, but some people bring happiness to others in their lifetime, unlike you.
---
&gt; Yeah but what if no tanks are on your friends list and you have to go to a major city and spam “need a tank, need a tank”.
---
I play a healer, tanks are looking for me.
---
It's like when GearScore addon was introduced back in Wrath. Just as bad and people hated it.
---
It is
---
With the current addon it DOES add people to a group automatically, and why dont people talk in retail then? YOu can still talk to people in a LFR group, yet no one does.
---
I think this is my new strat. I know I'll never compete with those able to sink 8+ hours a day into wow. My life permits maybe 3 hours a day if I'm willing to lose sleep, and depending on my workload that's not everyday.
---
I'll likely end up playing 15-20 hours a week(hopefully). I'll never compete with those rushing to 60, I'll be late to endgame. I'm okay with casually leveling and enjoying the ride. But I also want decent pvp along the way, so my best best is to join a more casual server with fewer hardcore elitists on it. I don't think the majority of casual vets like me have subbed yet(I haven't). Those already on servers are the hardcore of the hardcore. I'll wait till launch and hop on whatever new pvp realm opens up for us normies.
---
Literally same. For years....YEARS.
---
God I'm stupid
---
Already there.... with the migraine that is.
---
The point is that people like to be mad without understanding why they are mad. If someone  thought about the Joana thing for a couple seconds, they would realize how ridiculous it is to bash the guy for paywalling his work, but there were more than a couple people yesterday willing to just jump on the hate bandwagon.
---
Not even close to match their DPS.
---
It heavily depends on the friend you are trying get into classic.
---
I do!
---
I agree. Would be an awesome wallpaper
---
On nobody's side here but the onus of proof rests on the one making the claim.
---
Nelf is def the coolest looking race
---
Tanaris at night on that vast sand is so barren yet so satisfying. I remember spending weeks there because it was a good range for flurry axe to drop from memory .
---
alliance outnumbers horde in classic.
---
"our game"
---
Who's to say it's not also *everyone else's*?
---
TIL I have to name my feral druid warrbear
---
I have arranged for the project we were supposed to do the last week of August to be done the first week of September. So whole week for classic. Stress test taught me I can’t forget for breaks during the play as I tended to do so.
---
Will go to gym on Monday and to hot salt spa on Monday evening to make me as relaxed for Tuesday as possible. Will buy yoghurts, lots of non sparkling water, fruits and some dry bread. Won’t cook as I eat outside also will be nice break to walk 15min for the lunch.
---
Also forecast is 30 degrees and more over day so I purchased air conditioning (mobile one). It’s all for classic. The launch is at midnight I won’t log in that time, instead will try to get good amount of sleep to about 5 or 6 am when I will be starting. 
---
Breaks will be quick in home cardio 10 min maybe during the day, and 30 min of jogging on the late evening. Will go to Gym again on Friday.
---
One more great thing, the second week after launch I’m working but third week should also be free. Very happy about that as it will take about 3 weeks for the early hype to fall and my attitude to Classic shall mature up after.
---
[You've just crossed a terrible threshold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rluTukBjjTc), ReforgedRoyale.
---
There will be one anyways
---
I remember they said that even the low populated realms now would have more players than high populated servers back then. So I'd love a medium populated server like Firemaw but I fear it will will up. So maybe one of the new ones might be the way to go.
---
That's like what? 10-15 minutes for 5 runs.  It's just farmin' consumables for raids. Seems ok.
---
You don't need a Threat Meter for 5mans, ever.
---
Leveling, mage vs rogue. Are one significantly faster than the other?
---
I played a mage on beta till 20ish and dam you drink a lot.  Maybe I was using wrong rotation is there a consensus as to wich spell to use early. I  remember mostly casting frostbolt,  since that was my spec, but maybe frieball would have been more efficient at time.
---
Would love to watch it thanks!
---
I get what you're saying, but I disagree. Things like the activity and group trackers, meeting alerts, and enemy scans are far more thorough than even a huge clan would be.
---
I leveled as fire in vanilla. It was doable. Frost has more utility though. With enough free space to kite you can kill pretty much anything not immune to slowing effects plus its more mana efficient.
---
gehennas? wats dat voor gehannes, Vuurmouw!
---
So the announced new servers for both regions just made this survey unreliable and out of date. While it still gives a basic informations about the region population so much people will change their home servers to one of the new ones to avoid long queues. I know our survey opinions can be changed but the survey does not include the new realms and frankly, even if you can add the new realms people cba to go back to edit.
---
A new Survey may be useful.
---
Make sure you know the players before you start. Most random leveling groups break up after 1 day and that can be very frustrating :)
---
YEAH OUR MAFIA IS GONNA SOOO INTERNET BULLY YOU. BEWARE !!!!!!!
---
I see we're back to using gay as an insult in true "I was 13 in 2004" spirit
---
its almost like removing pvp servers and practically turning all of them into normal servers in retail was a stupid fucking move
---
If a first time then I'd say refer to a guide if you feel totally lost but otherwise enjoy the plethora of new experiences!
---
I definitely get you though: Desolace is a great example of an area that's worth looking at a guide for.
---
log on to play and just start making water while you socialize, fly to a leveling/questing area, whatever
---
it's a conjured item so it disappears when you log off, just fill a bag with it and any you don't need will go away when you log for the night
---
Sure, but still. You're getting 2.5 weapons per hour and unless you log out to wait for the lockout timer, you also need to run back and forth to the instance itself.
---
You didnt realise it has an "Auto Invite Function" SO you can GO away from your desk come BACK 5 minutes later and you have your FULL group with everyone already invited and READY to go  = exactly like modern lfg tools
---
I have a home now, thanks to Classic.
---
The main reason why I have a home is so that I can have a computer. The main reason why I have a computer is to play Classic.
---
Classic isn’t needed to kill retail since it already killed itself
---
Dude your example is two guys who are WoW content creators and have put hundreds if not thousands of hours into their class. And even then you admit it takes much more farming than other classes.
---
I’m giving general advice to your average person who hits 60. You’re saying my general advice isn’t true because if someone puts 1000 hours into the game they can make their class/spec viable.
---
Thanks for sharing
---
This so much
---
Be aware of your surroundings.
---
This is important for all classes of course, but as a mage you'll be moving around more than most on difficult pulls. Wandering into aggro radius of a mob pack you didn't see can be lethal.
---
Are you actually too dumb to realize those might be different people, or just acting dumb?
---
agreed. this is fine. it's just about forming a party and finding people quickly. you still have to travel to the damn dungeon with them so it's still gonna be great
---
obvious rogue is a safer, easier path. also mind you you gonna be forced to tank 5mans as a warrior at least in some situation. and being new its obviously more difficult task, than being a rogue.
---
though you want to play what you like in classic and where your heart belongs too, thats the most important thing. 
---
if they are both equal in your mind, i'd reccomend a rogue, cos its easier both at leveling and at 60  its easier, warrior need ton of gear before you start feeling good about yourself and your capabilities in both pvp and pve. aswell as friends, its more of an extraverted/social type of a gameplay, when rogue is more of a reclusive solo play.
---
Damn was gonna play Fairbanks but am a little worried now.......
---
Its like no one understands how a chat parser works lol
---
Jesus, this is going to be nuts. GG for the hype.
---
I'll at least show my friends how to display additionnal action bars and rebind their keyboards for strafing. This won't ruin any achievement feeling... They'll figure out the rest by themselves.
---
Agreed completely. Any addon that brings any automation to grouping for quests/pvp/dungeons etc. should not be acceptable. Thats exactly what goes against the spirit of Classic. 
---
Even if something like that was possible with then available code the players today are influenced by modern grouping addons and would unintentionally ruin the social aspect of the game with it.
---
because fire can't aoe farm
---
you are being overly upset about someone’s opinion, and are quite literally “REEE”ing people have the right to complain about something they feel may affect their gameplay, but go off
---
a mouse like a naga with like 12 buttons on the side helps a lot in games like this , i pretty much only use my left hand for wsad
---
in your case you could bind autorun to the side of the mouse and use holding left and right click to look , but thats about the best i can do for ya
---
even then classic wow's progression is slow enough that anyone can learn while playing because you literally wont have more than 3-4 abilities to actively use for the first 10 hours on basically any class
---
You haven't seem the demo?  There is an option to bypass chat entirely.
---

People keep reminding me about a ton of stuff I forgot about vanilla. Like Org zepplins being outside the city, or Druids not having a normal rez. I'm just so hyped.
---
Do you understand how this addon works? This type of addon existed in vanilla in the form of vQueue and CTA. Guess what. People who used it enjoyed it. People who didn't use it didn't care, because it didn't impact them.
---
Of course its fucking Kurthos.
---
Now i feel bad because you actually found a great spot to retire him, meanwhile i left my hunter in ogrimar a few weeks ago and uninstalled retail
---
No

He has a very particular set of skills. Those being an extremely large bank account and an equally large number of mercenaries queuing up to help empty it.

You either have Autoshot activated, or Autoattack. You can freely switch between the two fairly seamlessly, unlike Warriors using a bow, or casters using a Wand.
---
Ok, whatever. Believe what you want. The LFG addons will be in the game. Quit if you want, I don't care and most people don't either. You won't be missed.
---
The only thing that I noticed is that sometimes it is important to keep it a bit with humor as this won't give the impression that this is an addiction. Every partner would maybe feel worried if there is such a high engagement towards a game. Mass media made being engaged for games kind of a bad thing. ( Even declared by the WHO :) )

Also important to find a way to handle the " but what am I going to do when you are playing" objection...one that i come across often with my magic the gathering or basketball evenings :)

Well, as a Warrior even with the longer leveling phase, you'll have no problems finding groups because you can tank. You'll get raid- ready much quicker.
---
In raids both are viable DPS classes, rogues are better for world PvP, Warriors are better in battlegrounds (with a healer).
---
But never forget: Warriors are more gear dependent than rogues.
---
cheers pal!

I've done my time! Long long time. I'm a dad now, I prefer my spare time cycling or running to gaming, but I still have a special place in my heart for this girl, despite her having a few facelifts since being undead. She's seen quite a lot of people and collected some lovely orange treasure there too! I couldnt mount Alar inside, but her time is done. I can't wait to be casual at 2-3 hours....per week! Good luck all, I hope you all find a way, just as Xien/Sien did.
---
Elaborate. Why is it trash? Since this whole post is about ClassicLFG, explain why that is bad. I honestly feel like the only reason ClassicLFG is getting shit on so much is because it has the word "LFG" in the title, but prove me wrong.
---
4 gold, 20 silver, 69 copper. Noicccccceeee

As feral tank what I need to farm "more"? Can you explain it short to me? I heard about cat with powershift and so on. But what exactly you mean with farm more? :)
---
ugh!

I'm also curious how loot will work. I remember the good old days of joining a pug and the some plate wearer stealing all the loot...*I WANT MY CLOTH PANTS BAAACCK!*

You don't even have to ENTER+CTRL+C+CTRL+V anything, create a macro like "/2 LFM Deadmines" and place the macro on your your action-bar, lets say "G". Now click "G" once every 30/40 sec or if you're really lazy create a keyboard macro (available on most gaming keyboards) that clicks "G" for you instead.
---
The only non-crucial part of forming a group from a gameplay perspective is everything leading up to the whisper. If the community reinforces chat channels like "/join deadmines" you wouldn't even have to spam. The entire reason you're forced to spam is because the messages are drowned in a sea of random garbage, people looking for other dungeons, people trading items etc.
---
This is probably less work than organizing in eve.
---
We don't allow giveaways from general users here... it becomes a huge liability and in many cases turns into people hosting a "giveaway" after making people come to their stream / YouTube video / etc. So, we can't allow it here, but you can try r/wow or somewhere else.
---
Does it break what now? No one told you to use it. Stop being a little bitch about this...
---
People implemented it in vanilla with CTA. Do you understand how this addon works? It spams LFG requests via a channel you specify (Trade/General/LFG). If you select the auto invite checkbox it simply invites anyone who whispers you when LFM. It's pretty much the same thing as macro spamming.
---
Also ban anyone that played in Vanilla or on private servers because remembering quests is also unfair!
---
Druids are better tanks until later into classic prove me wrong
---
I want to remember they werent even 25 people
---
If you want to be a good tank, yeah, stance dance is a thing. It's not that you couldn't do it without it, it just makes you better.
---
And when everyone becomes a prof. There are no nurses left..
---
Well I definitely didn't expect that! Thanks very much!
---
It is special to be part of the first few weeks.. but that said, as time goes on I’ll bet that the queue time will die off as well. So it’s not that big of an issue, and if you like to play on a high populated server and being guaranteed that the server will never die, it’s pretty understandable that one might wanna stay. Plus communities and server identity is being established, which are important factors.
---
Personally I’ve moved from Shazzrah to Firemaw. Aaaand for my money I hope they stay, so I’ve less queue time 😉

Myself and 3 others have taken one day off (Tuesday) for Classic, and as hyped as we are, we all plan on taking it nice and easy. We all work 9-5 and go to the gym/play sports very regularly, and that will absolutely not change.
---
We're determined to enjoy the shit out of Classic WoW together, but real life is absolutely more important, more so now than 10+ years ago. It might take us a fair while to get to 60, we might fall a little behind the curve on raiding content (we're all PvP'ers, but PvE is necessary even for PvP'ers), our epic mount might be a pipe dream, rank 14 definitely is a pipe dream; but I'm pretty confident we're going to enjoy this iteration of WoW more than any other.
---
I'm in the same boat, can't decide which to play out of lock and mage. Locks look like more fun but mages seem superior in every way. Can't imagine myself doing both as its classic and the 6 months to 60 issue.
---
Best classes for leveling: Hunter, warlock and Druid. Mages can also be amazing if you know how to AoE grind mobs.
---
Oh, maybe my experience was different because I had rare enchants. I sold mats in AH and only did enchants with people's mats plus craft fee, depending on the enchant. I sat in IF and made serious bank.
---
thanks for responding to what i said with an actual argument.
---
first, i think it's pretty unfair to use someone playing on a private server as an example in this case. there are many differences between melee mechanics on that server and the confirmed behavior by Blizzard on the 1.13 client, one example being custom formulas for how +weapon skill works in terms of hit and glancing blows. i believe these discrepancies will make feral damage much more punishing on classic.
---
also, this is a highlight reel of some of his best fights in addition to fast guild clears; the flamegor kill was under 50 seconds, and this inflates his DPS because he is able to abuse the 50% attack speed increase for the majority of the fight duration while simultaneously minimizing how much mana he has to spend powershifting (using innervate on himself in each fight). this kind of damage isn't sustainable on longer fights, whereas the warriors and rogues can dps infinitely and more consistently regardless of the fight duration. notice that he doesn't include any videos of long fights in this snapshot, like ragnaros, chromaggus, or nefarian, only extremely quick fights like the drakes in BWL and fankriss in AQ40. this is because he cannot compete with the other dps on longer fights.
---
i think feral druids are viable in raids, but mainly as a utility class to be able to offtank or decurse as opposed to purely focusing on damage. especially in early progression, feral druids are at a huge disadvantage.
---
1. Yes.
---
2. Rogue
---
3. Warlock

NE could be mages for forever. Then the sundering happened y and they "chose" Not to. Thats how bloodelves became a thing. So, If you create a nightelf mage you should just be race changed to bloodelf IMO.
---
And as for orc warlocks, they said that orc warlocks operate in secret, and that you can easily have your pet out in a city is indeed a gameplay&gt;lore type of thing.
---
I'm only going to try log in on Tuesday evening after work. Hopefully I get in as that is where I would be staying until Sunday...
---
I disagree with this. If this is the best way of finding dungeons, everyone will do it. If you choose not to, your groups will form more slowly and people won't want to wait for them. You're effectively isolating yourself into the slow queue, knowing that others will not join you because it's slow.  
---
If the addon doesn't exist, everyone is in the slow queue and so your group will fill faster.
---

Thank you

---
If all of us, who wants the genuine wow experience, simply ignores these addons. I think and hope that most of them will slowly die out by themselves. Whatever you do, dont jump the train because you feel like you need to - stick to your classic principle.
---
Sorry, misunderstood you than
---
This is exactly how I feel about the game. Thanks for the insight, I will follow your lead and hop on a newer server. They may end up dropping a new one on launch day.
---
WHY CAN'T I PLAY A QUILLBOAR!?!?!
---
Can't find this podcast on Podcast Addict, is it only on YouTube or what's it called elsewhere?
---
its doing great now, classic community just love to hate on everything, and most probably have not played retail since launch of BFA
---
happy _mana_ cake day
---
I’m so sorry
---
Yeah, well, I don't like you!
---
The best way to force blizzard's hand is to use the same apis and calls that addon uses to create your own addon that abuses them to the max.
---
unironically thinking private server monkeys can compete mechanically with retail chimps
---
How do you avoid using it? You know it is going to show up in chat right?
---
How can u compare any degree to a game?? 
---
Wtf is wrong with u ?
---
Everybody can be viable as a druid with a bit more effort (farming consumables) cause of guys like shedo and skarm thats my point. 
---
Just accept the fact that u didnt know shit about the class and stop trying to counter an argument that u cant support.
---
Im done here gl and just inform urself about things u wanna argue..
---
Thanks m8, this is exactly what I was after.
---
There's no official agreement or coalition or any representative community. I'm just saying what I see in Romanian WoW Discord channels and several Facebook groups. I just want people to find that answer here as well.
---
Hunter - really good levelling, mediocre dps, good utility endgame. on Alliance, it's the only class that wear mail at endgame, so low loot competition
---
Mage - good levelling, great dps, low skill floor and high skill cieling, potentially a lot of competition at endgame
---
Warlock - good levelling, cheap riding training, good dps. a bit tedious because of soul shards
---
Druid - good fast levelling with a few good options, but endgame raiding they only really excel as resto
---
Priest - top healer, dwarf has fear ward which is ace, very much sought after. a bit slow to level but you will never struggle to find groups for dungeons/raids etc
---
Paladin - very slow levelling and similar to druid with endgame, healing is likely what youre gonna end up doing
---
Warrior - insanely slow levelling, but worth the commitment. best tank all-round and Arms is absolutely lethal in both PvE and PvP
---
Rogue - potential for overpopulation on PvP realms but good dps for both PvE and PvP. medium levelling speed. stealth is fun, so is lockpicking
---
Shaman - very middle-ground. ok levelling, ok dps, ok healing. Windfury is deadly on enhancement cause you can use 2h weapons but it's not exactly a fire/arcane mage with instant Pyroblast
---
You don't think the devilsaur consortium won't be doing the same thing on every layer? You underestimate how far they will go to have a total monopoly on the market. 
---
It's not about getting their rogues/hunters/warriors geared, it's about being able to sell devilsaur leather for 50g a piece because there is no competition and everyone wants it for BiS crafts.
---
I think the difference between Questie and ClassicLFG is that Questie will just alter your experience and save you a google search straight to wowhead.
---
ClassicLFG on the other hand is going to actively take people away from chat channels to provide this quick, safe and easy alternative and a huge part of why people are excited for Classic is how reliant on the community and your connections to the other players in the game. An addon like this is spitting directly in the face of the mantra for Classic WoW of bringing players to interact with players. A lot of things are slow and your character is very weak, but all of this comes together into a  very deliberate experience that will almost force you to rub elbows with other players on a near daily basis. The current WoW's philosophy seems to be making an arcadey style game you can log into and shut your brain off. People don't want this for Classic. 
---
The ultimate reason why people aren't as up in arms is that while Questie isn't "authentic" it also isn't toxic and isn't going to ruin the game, it's not worth an argument unless you're in an arguing mood. 
---
I personally hope Blizzard steps in and bricks ClassicLFG
---
I'm literally counting the minutes until launch. It kinda sucks though cos none of my friends are even bothered about it :(
---

On most bosses in MC it's not a good idea to be in melee range weaving raptor strikes. So, you're only getting limited time weaving on trash and maybe a few bosses which would be 1 weave per 10 seconds, or about a 5-10% dmg increase, but the total is much much lower.
---
Overall I enjoyed cata--even a lot of the revamped zones.  I fucking hated what they did to the Barrens though.
---
Way to ruin one of the most atmospheric zones in the game
---
First forming, another forming after first boss and then a 3rd time cause people have to have a life.. 4 hours later..
---
Because spending 2 hours for anything that trivial is just pathetic and a complete waste of time.
---
As a warrior who will be tanking in 5 mans I'm giving the hunter class, as a whole, one chance. The moment someone pulls some shit there is no more hunters in my 5 mans.
---
People will be using it to join your group and you wont even know. Lol
---
What the fuck is wrong with people. Was this kind of stuff happening on Nostalrius, too?
---
Wow, what a great plan. First let people gather until the first two servers become unplayable. Then add 1 more servers thats also going to have 4 hour queue. Wow, amazing plan. Must be all that data helping them out.
---
I have some maps of wow left around i think i need to frame them now 15 years later :p
---
Why would anyone use the autoinvite for a dungeon run in the first place?
---
The autoinvite is only bad for phase 1 questing when the layering is still in,if people can use it to layerhop
---
and then you meet the people from Emerald Dream who are flooding Grobbulus and you realize you've stepped foot into a toxic cesspool.
---
Both classes have a high skillcap for PvP, so both should suit your PvP focus. However, levelling a mage is more convenient because of conjurables and teleports. I'll also pick mage (never really played mage before) for the new experience, and another pro is the mage not lacking essential PvP spells/abilities (like shadowstep).
---
P.S.: Sorry for no cons, I have decided mage over rogue based on the above.
---
I'm really, really torn tbh but I've narrowed it to druid, lock, or rogue but will likely have alts of everything.
---
Not a bad choice. Always ready for auctions. Wise move my friend. Social interaction will be just as plenty inside dungeons anyway because you can't faceroll. Getting a group running faster is just better.
---
but youtube is only moving pictures
---
There’s really no benefit. This is the thinking that dragged retail down. Not everything needs to have some QoL component. Just enjoy the game and embrace the fact that sometimes you have to put in a little work to create a group.
---
I'll be leveling with my friend who's a hunter, so hopefully that'll help her a good bit. :D thanks!
---
Get level 5 .. then start picking up your professions &amp; leveling them up until your friend logs in &amp; gets level 5.. As soon as he/she gets to the quest you're on, game time. 
---
You're welcome, lol.
---
If this is all true you would understand how a group finder dehumanises the process of finding people. You would understand people will just become numbers (ilvl + char lvl). You would understand how this completely goes against the spirit and ethos of classic and you would be against using it.
---
Ah man no ZT! These are amazing
---
It clearly showed the invite happening after the player whispered "invite please", which has been a functionality in many addons for many years, including in vanilla.
---
No one cares about your super sekrit list though, we care about what we can see, and he provided more than you did.
---
Rude
---
You have nice teeth is why I asked
---
You could say exactly the same thing for retail — don’t use dungeon finder, don’t use LFR. The problem is it becoming popularised and new the norm. 
---
This add-on is antithetical to the philosophy of Classic.
---
 My stance is that if in a PUG everyone should roll on it, being alchemist or not. I am not saying people should roll need on whatever they like, far far from it. This item however is special exception because of how much it's worth. I wouldn't be surprised if you could get 1k gold for it pretty early on the server( hardcore guilds putting their funds together to buy it).
---
 Obviously if running with a guild or friends and it drops it's different. I just don't think it's realistic to except 4 strangers you have never played with before to hand you a fortune of gold.
---
I'm still salty about the hunter who won Rod of the Sleepwalker against my first Priest back in 2005.
---
That sounds like a perfectly legitimate place to fish for such a sword.
---
I need every ounce of self control to not go there and fish now.
---
Leveled both to 60 in vanilla. Rogue is notoriously difficult early on. Melee classes are very gear dependent in vanilla, and Rogue cannot dual wield for quite some time. They are great money earners with pickpocketing mid to late game however, and they really come into their own when they have reasonable gear and you put some points into the stealth  talent (getting sap off without NPCs seeing you first isn't always going to happen without improved stealth)  to not over pull mobs and hold your own. Mage is far easier all around. Frost is great for leveling, pretty much every talent in the tree is a winner, and you have decent ability to survive ganks and overpulling. Early on, use the spell that hits hardest. After you get talents, use your spec spells :)
---
Din't 'a start none, wouldn't 'a been none! Nasty bellowin' invaders are lucky we didn't round 'em up for the slaughter. It were what they planned fer us, no mistake.
---
Any chat channel, like trade. And that's a good idea. 1 person could make the addon so frustrating for others.
---
I feel like the sheer number of people one these servers will massively disrupt these syndicates. If there are too many people in un'goro, blizz will shard it, increasing the amount of devilsaur leather available, and making it harder to camp. 
---
Syndicates only work if they can control it. But with enough people they cant + people in classic will be down for a zerg brawl anyday, if it was like the days of old.
---
I’ll still log into retail after the next major patch just to check out what’s new and I’ll finish my pathfinder achievement so that if the next expansion isn’t shit and I decide to level a character I will at least be able to fly through bfa
---
Hell, if the addon makes you get the group an hour or more faster than the old fashioned way. You can possibly run two dungeons instead
---
some fury warriors used Ironfoe for execute phases in BC raids because of how much rage the proc generated
---
Man, posts like these really encourage us fatties/out of shapers to work out hard. Congrats on the weight loss! I’m 96 kg but friends/parents always joke that I’m 4 months pregnant so you get the idea (beer belly). I hope to lose 1 lb a week!
---
It's almost as if this subreddit is not a hive mind and everyone has their own opinions.
---
Also, you can agree or disagree with an opinion regardless of who is saying it. It's a sad world where it's more important WHO instead of WHAT they're saying
---
I was apart of a morning raid build in tbc and would stay up all night playing, raid at 8am, and then run lost raid dungeons around noon ish and finally sleep by 2 or 3. Looking back I don’t even recognize that person anymore tho.

There was no ilvl addon in pandaria. I returned in Pandaria and had no problem catching up and finishing all dungeons in challenge modes, for example. If you couldn't do it, you did something wrong. And if you did not understand what you did wrong, then you have no idea about game. Simple as that.
---
exactly, the retail pvp playerbase is getting smaller and smaller(look at lfg, look at leaderboards). their wow arena stream has seen a sharp decline too. wow pvp is just a side minigame without any balance patches.
---
Blizzard need to ban you.
---
If the alchemist needs it, they should roll (and then use it) - but unfortunately this is not really enforced very well... i.e some people need on it to sell it, or some profession users that already have it learned take it to sell
---
If the addon is simply a scanner of chat messages that highlights who is looking for more / a group then its fine. There's zero problem with that.
---
Blizzard should hire you.
---
People almost always declined me when I invited them in these scenarios during the stress test :/
---
I think it's the same for every profession if I remember correctly. Enchant, Alchi or whatever recipes that drop anyone can roll on. I think they changed it sometime in TBC where you could only roll if you had that profession (or was it in WotLK?).
---
&gt;Skill &gt; gear as the game is easy and all you need to do is follow simple instructions to do the raids/dungeons
---
????????????
---
What the hell are you trying to say. All your comments are backwards.
---
Thank you so much! I can’t decide beetween warrior and rogue damn, i saw some videos and they look amazing
---
Not when they're tanking like the OP stated he was.
---
The Chat spammed 100 times the question. Remove the Fookin LFG addon! And no one asked that question. GG
---
There were definitely people who thought some kinds of mods were cheating. But there were also people who thought every single add-on was actually just malware. So what I'm saying is some people in Vanilla were just dumb when it came to mods.
---
Not pictured: the Fire Roc that just aggroed and dazed you off your mount.

---
That mouse did cross my mind at one point, but id have to use it left handed. 
---
Ive been lookong at getting a steam controller as I could easily hold it with both hands while my arm is in a sling. Should work well enough in the lower levels / until i recover.
---
Depends a lot on the group you play with.
---
Some prearrange drops so that BOE blue/epic/recipe are all need, some still let player that need them have it.
---
If it were me, i would let an alchemist have it if he could use it.
---
If i were the alchemist i might offer x amount of money to each player as to "buy" it off all of them, but cheaper than AH prices.
---
\*\*Cooking &amp; First Aid

Fixed that for you.  Both are great.  Both have uses while leveling, for your guild, and for end game content.

Well anyone that's worth grouping with will know that iLvL is not relevant information, so it's an easy way to spot who to avoid :)

---
If "summer" is a cumulative adjective rather than co-ordinate, yes.
---
There's a dungeon finder addon? How would that work?
---
This subreddit is literally a hivemind where every couple of days the hivemind finds a new non-issue they know nothing about to complain. Just like everyone in this thread has no idea what the add-on works like, all that seems to be said here is "lfg reeeeeeeee".
---
Good. If it is so useless then nobody will use it.

Better pick one or the other, can’t have both in this lifetime homie

Generating rage from having to do this quest.
---
It was asked but the audio cut out for them and so it got skipped over.
---
What about Icefury Wand or the other wands from the same quest reward options? Around 37 DPS wand at level around 35 for Mages. Also improve spell damage at the same time.
---
I don't think you want those cloths.
---

---
Big takeaway in the first 8 min that was news to me:  they had very little done when they announced in 2017. Like, virtually nothing but Omar's proof of concept.
---
Guns have always been annoying tho
---
You say that, having never spent 3 hours looking for a healer for an obscure dungeon nobody's doing yet/anymore. Think purely functional; you made a proper "but it feels good" argument. Its nonsense mate, everybody complained back in the day until they put in a group finder. Its not that hard to be nice to people in those groups you find, maybe start there? Its nonsense that everyone will suddenly not treat others as a person, thats just people being jerks. Maybe the problem is your attitude, the 'ethos' of classic, don't make me laugh, missing features are not features.
---
I would prefer it if you'd be quiet.
---
Not mine but:
---
Lok'tar Ogar, brother!
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the First War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and* Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*
---
Hey brah why aren't you wearing your higher ilvl T2 over T1?
---
Because it has fucking spirit on it?
---
Great! Use those guides. Have fun that. 
---
You only care about what you can see. What a horrible way to go about life. To Each Their Own.
---
Why can't Hunters have the ability to Skin all humanoids?
---
Just find a guild with a schedule that fits yours. 3 hours on a raidnight is enough for many.
---
People aren’t going to use auto invite.
---
i fucking hate these pepole who always say "oh dont use it"
---
That doesnt work like that.. if pepole start using it more it becomes part of the meta and pepole begin using it
---
same with gearscore.. nobody likes gearscore but becuease every guild used it.. then pepole had to auctelly use that shit
---
Slander. He's an honest business owner.
---
39inches of smashing fun got me
---
That is amazing work, hope I can find more of my old homies :)
---
It's definitely not useless. It's a great addon. It just doesn't do what everyone thinks it does. You don't get teleported to a dungeon. You don't mass whisper invite every warrior in the game who isn't looking for a group. It doesn't guarantee you a dungeon run.
---
It is however a helpful tool for trying to setup parties and manage invites.
---
I actually described it completely wrong. Because the "Summer Child" is the entity being described, Summer isn't an adjective of the child.
---
I'd say druid and a good feral rank would be wanted in dungeons and end game too. Also you can respec at 60 for dungeons anyway. Off spec healers and tanks are fine till higher level dungeons :)
---
I've seen a lot of people saying that you can easily tank as Arms/Fury pre-60, and that even some 60 dungeons are doable. I don't know if random groups are gonna be okay with that though...
---

But the game is not. Retail has far more and far better content suited for the people you describe

nah it went from "these addons are fine because i like they way they convenience me" to "this addon is not fine because I don't like it way it conveniences others"
---
get over yourselves.
---
Sanctuaries ruined the sense of war. Change my mind
---
I remember seeing this guy on youtube, he had an addon that would bring up portals and teleports spells around his mouse cursor (on a key press, I assume).
---
Does anyone know an addon that can do that and that works on classic? Looked really convenient.
---
The real question is, who will fight against using damage meters? To avoid the “I must top dps at all costs!” Guys
---
the biggest con for mages is you will be very prone to one shot ambushes anytime you sit down to drink without a shield up.
---
Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Start your attunements and gearing runs at 55 and by 60 you will have made a dent in both.
---
Hopefully word will spread that valuing item-level over stats is a clear way to identify yourself as a clueless idiot.
---
I doubt anyone will bother making a "check for BiS gear" addon, since they'd also have to account for alternatives on every slot for every spec of every class.
---
Although I wonder what they'll come up with as a replacement for Curve when PuGs start running raids months from now.
---
Sadly I could actually understand a raid-leader wanting certain guarantees when inviting random people. If you have a group of brainless keyboard-turners you'd wipe on the first Elemental trash in MC.
---
Tipsout asked it. Some audio cut out yada yada, devs (unintentionally I believe) didn't answer the question directly and Classicast members didn't insist on it, probably because they didn't wanna come across as agressive.

Ok so i played vanilla from the start and continued playing till bfa. The lfg channel was only in cities at first, then they made it global in 1.11 but that wasnt a channel that you would auto join. And i never used it, and all the people who i played with never used it aswell. We were making trips to the cities to get people and stuff. Why? Because we were used to doing that and we liked doing that. 
---
I believe after some time they reverted the global lfg to cities again.

Im telling you, there were addons like call to arms or whatever back in vanilla aswell, but people rarely used them back then. Why do you think that is? Because back then, players were not just numbers or achievements, they were characters that you played with in a beautiful game, the game became so popular not because it was easy or revolutionary in mechanics or graphics. It became a huge success because of the social aspect of it. So for me, defending these kinds of addons are asking for less social interaction in a game where its most strong aspect is being social. Its like asking well, CoD is great and all but lets not put that many guns in it. 
---
Its a hard topic to explain and understand. And i am sorry that i cant really express my feelings about these better. 
---
I am just a person who wants this game to be as beautiful and as social as it was years ago when almost nobody used these addons back then. Thats all.
---
I believe only YouTube and twitch but it’s esfantv for YouTube and twitch
---
You can add weapons to the popular hunter google sheets one, just look in the hidden tabs.
---
All BoEs and tradable recipes should be needed by everybody as everybody has a use for the item. Everybody is a winner and there is no potential for ninjas when everybody has an equal shot of getting value.
---
1, slippery slope? We have layering, technically the most cancerous change that could've ever happened. It didn't open floodgates. We're not getting skeletons because of potential hate speech... I'm not sure how gawking "no changes" at the war effort, that no one knew the details of, doesn't hold true now that everyone knows the item requirements on day 1. The war effort was literally memorable because people came together for a common goal. 
---
4, Did you play vanilla? These gates didn't open up quickly at all, I don't understand what you're saying? There was no strategic hoarding that pushed the gates open in a day? There was no "accidental" hoarding that we somehow managed to horde the right things. As the top guilds we made a forum post when we suspected we'd open the gates and gave people a heads up so they could participate in the event.
---
Anyone blindly gawking no changes for resources on the AQ gates opening never played Vanilla, or is planning on capitilizing on the economy through information that isn't "vanilla like". We didn't know about that them, this now alters the economy leading up to and after the AQ patch. 
---
Some negatives to chew on:
---
World First Races: whether you like them or not, the gates are part of it. You can throw any number you want at me for bagslots. Any hardcore guild will easily prepare for a day one opening. 
---
You'll most likely miss the gates opening event as it will be an obscure time to maximize their raid lead. Remember there's epics and increased drop rates during this event, plus it's hilariously fun. 
---
All items will be stockpiled from day one, the economy will be notably different from your "authentic experience". This is a lesser negative, the consumable meta has evolved so there's already differences that aren't controllable. 
---
The turns ins for the war effort award reputation commendations ... You can target the capital you want or need. This was arguably the most iconic and impactful way to target your off-race mount choices.
---
I'm just speechless on how anyone that actually played Vanilla or wasn't interesting in gaming the market could be ok with this.
---
Well you're a great husband for doing all of this research so she can play comfortably.
---
That breaks census+, so you are removing the capability for people to find out the activity of their server.
---
People used it. Just not everyone. Same thing with ClassicLFG and CTA. NOT EVERYONE will use it. Complaining about it won't solve anything, because people fail to realize what the addon actually does.
---
How could it possibly be mandatory? It works within the current system, how is it possible to be so dense.
---
You sir, are a wise man
---
No you dont, it automatically invites.
---
Nice one! I’ll give ya that. Our medical situation is abhorrent.
---
&gt;e
---
think of the war efforts hand-in during AQ opening event. On a 80/20 server, 20% need to farm and hand in the same amount as the other 80% unless some serious neutral AH trading happens
---
Who pays $7 for breakfast each day?
---
Everything Goretusk related....
---
?? So you dont HAVE TO whisper anybody??
---
Can't you get a new "dead on arrival" topic of the day? This one is getting boring.
---
&gt; All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full.

---
Think thighs save lives bro
---
Just a small correction in that Shaman also wear mail armor in addition to hunters.
---
Everything was tge beggining of the end for you lot
---
They scammed you out of half a months sub. It's a dick move from a massive company and they'll never even apologize.
---
I'll add that group finder hurts the community a matchmaker instead of having people form bonds and relationships to create a group of people that run together.
---
Yea everyone here scrambling to perserve the ol' classic feel, but this ship has sailed. A gearscore addon will definitely come... there's pretty firm BiS lists for every class, which is what the addon will look at. Not at ilvl.
---
No they were not and 99% of the people didnt use it.
---
Why would you not strive to do the most dps you can in raid?
---
I'll personally see to it as I myself am a navy seal.
---
Beautiful!
---
True. Mage is also gear dependent. Sure, frost mages have a lot of control, but if you don't have enough int/spelldam to actually kill your opponent, eventually they'll kill you (or you'll go OOM).
---
&gt;Looks like you never played eve... device that number by 10. Eve is a multiboxing game with people having 10+ accounts.
---
they hated him because he spoke the truth
---
CTA was popular on some servers. Just because you didn't use it doesn't mean other people didn't.
---
You lucky one, but that's means i will not able to post the funny part :(
---
true. and still going to create a character on the full server
---
I'm not disagreeing with you on the fact that engineering is top tier for pretty much anything, it's just that you said "LW doesn't really offer anything useful" which isn't true, even though it's one of the least picked profs it has it's uses. 
---
Buying from the AH means that someone has to craft them and that someone is going to be making a lot of gold early on if they can a part of the devilsaur mafia, I'm merely showing the person asking that there are more ways to play the game than the singular line that everyone seems to believe in.
---
Besides at one point if he truly wishes, he can drop skinning and lvl engineering once he's made enough gold and keep LW as a deeprock cd gold maker if he really wishes.
---
Just play Horde and be done with it.
---
 You will just have to make a judgement what playing a shaman is worth. Also are you dead set on shaman for sure? If you switch main after a while you will be stuck on horde unless you scrap everything and roll on a different server.
---
People keep spamming this but 99% of the playerbase didnt use it. Otherwise where does this "spam trade chat" comes from?
---
Having such a system as an addon is quite detrimental to the game, as it requires 0 player interaction.
---
Atleast with external sites &amp; voice-chats, you have to actively search for parties. Maybe you don't like these other players, you can avoid them for further grouping. I just like to pick &amp; choose, instead of an automated process.
---
People have been grouping up with external programs, such as mIRC, before the dawn of modern MMO's.
---
You dont really need to be prot spec until like 58 for LBRS and UBRS. Warriors are cable of tank with just shield and sword.
---
As a hunter I like this bar 1 little thing. Wicked arrows and impact shot are not implemented until the pre tbc patch sadly. otherwise handy go to cheat sheet
---
Yes as a csstable where as mages etc get an instant damage spell
---
It's highly subjective
---
Are we there, yeti? ..........
---
Mage is definitely top-tier and notably faster than rogue. Once you hit mid 20's as a frost mage, then the possibility of aoe farming opens up to you, which can be a game changer.
---
Try renaming the folder to "eCastingBar" (I guess yours is probably named "eCastingBar-Classic").
---
To avoid downloading the whole GitHub content of files I suggest you download the release file [here](https://github.com/shoestare/eCastingBar-Classic/releases) (or [direct link](https://github.com/shoestare/eCastingBar-Classic/releases/download/release-1.4.2/eCastingBar-release-1.4.2.zip)) instead of downloading the whole -master branch! It'll have the good folder name, too :)
---
I changed the link in the OP to avoid this!
---
Speak for yourself, Old Blanchy would be an instant reroll for me
---
I think the no comma version is correct, given the context. I think the adjectives are cumulative because "Summer, sweet child" doesn't make sense.
---
Razorfen is already on medium.
---
ah, i see you are a man of culture as well (and a chad warrior)
---
It automatically invites if you select the checkbox and they whisper invite. Are you mad that the party leader isn't right clicking invite on a individuals name manually?
---
finding a group isnt instant.
---
frat, mango and goons
---
suddenly i'm not worried lmao
---
We live on a planet
---
Why would I roll need on strength weapons? I'll roll need on items I *need*.
---
Also a reminder, accepting party invitations can trigger layering
---
To be fair, no one is forcing you to use this addon...
---
You have no idea how many brainless basilisks are walking around in Blasted lands..
---
This. I was in a guild on one unnamed pserver. People were casually getting to level 60, doing their prebises. We were doing raids 2 nights per week - MC, Ony, BWL, ZG. Then I stopped playing and was waiting for classic.  But I´ve heard from a friend that they cleared Naxxramas with 3 raids per week schedule. Server was up and is still up. 1 year old server. With 2 year progression circle, you will be just fine. Just forget about alts and other games if you are playing 3 days a week and you are good.
---
Oh, I had all of the glove enchants except threat, I had 22 int, 30 spell power, healing to wrist, and -threat to cloak. Plus the usual stuff like 15 agi wep, crusader, fiery, etc.
---
It should be as it was. Allows for some drama and if someone who doesn't really need it rolls need just for the money, and others can't need it because they can't use it. Just keep as it was. If your an idiot about loot word will spread, just as it should, it's all part of the community surrounding a server. If you grief you dig yourself in a hole. It's core to the vanilla experience I would say. 
---
Also in fairly sure you could never trade loot in raids in vanilla, actually I'm certain as I was raidleader and master looter for all raids in MC in my guild. Once you gave someone an item it was no going back, other than in certain instances where you could contact a GM.
---
Neither is ClassicLFG
---
&gt;on Alliance, it's the only class that wear mail at endgame
---
Hi, /u/cyberraver35
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuc5kv/ive_seen_murlocs_mentioned_but_you_know_what_i/). 
---
&gt; Did you seriously think Blizzard was done adding servers or something?
---
No, actually i said 5 hours prior to addition of the servers in our guild discord that blizzar will add 3-4 servers more.
---
The 180 i meant was, they gave up on adding 1 server at a time, waiting it to fill. They actively DOUBLED the number of PVP servers, pre launch. At once.
---
Meaning they finally hit the panic button. They made this mess and no matter what happens, its going to be on them. And its not just the launch, they have promised to no layers in phase 2. That can be a SHITSHOW in the biggest servers. Suddenly to have massive ques, again.
---
r/woosh
---
Wich nobody used.
---
Just use any 2h that isnt bre? Noone uses 2handers besides hunters for pve
---
Stay in retail, mate.
---
Imo the real LFG issue is being partied up with people from another server....
---
When it's all just in the same server it's just a more convenient place to find people to group with.
---
Ban those warlocks too, because they can summon and ruin our run to the dungeon experience!!!
---
Hate to break it to you bud but the damage your skills do is determined by the stats on your gear.
---
You can follow simple instructions all you want but the guy with 300 more spell power that's also following simple instructions is going to outdamage you.
---
At the end of the day the goal is to reduce the enemy's HP bars to 0 before yours. That requires numbers.
---
Yes it's possible to overgear content. That doesn't mean it's not possible to undergear it.
---
That requires a full run through uldaman, thats not doable at 35
---
Do you like tanking? If yes Warrior, if no Rogue.
---
Also consider that Warrior is a bigger time commitment because you'll probably be collecting three sets of gear - for tanking, dpsing, and pvp. And depending on how good you try to make your tank set it can be very expensive.
---
I would have to agree here. For sure original classic servers had their own cliques and mafia's etc. But it was not on the scale to which it seems to be being organized for classic. In most cases the communication tools (discord etc) were simply not there. I obviously want to play with good players at end game, but if it means going onto a server where people will literally be breaking the game... I don't think I would enjoy that experience.   
---
Getting ganked repeatedly is one thing. But to have entire areas locked out due to mafias or people camping spawns etc wouldn't be fun, or organic.
---
&gt; So yeah if it will happen at all it will become requirement.
---
That's why people want it to be banned, i think, personally im pretty neutral about it
---
You must be unfamiliar with the Mafia meme.
---
Hobbies and interests are expensive.  
---
WoW only costs $15 a month.  And private servers are free lol.
---
It was popular on certain servers. Some servers used it more than others. Just because you didn't doesn't mean others didn't either.
---
me aswell, switched from life time ally (switched to horde a bit but not that much) and now finally to horde
---
Most fun class in my opinion. And since I love healing, endgame is perfect.
---
Can't they just abuse the 30 day wait time on mail?
---
Which people did use just not on your server.
---
This addon will fail as soon as people see that the good players and in demand specs (tanks and healers) aren't using the addon because they get to chose who they group with and they will always favor guildies and friends over an addon super PUG.  People will realize that there is no way to get around the fact that you can't really succeed with this game unless you can make friends, and all will be right in the world of warcraft again :)
---
That’s what I always did, are we the bad for not keybinding it
---
For the raids prior to AQ40/Naxx, you'll have the time.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/mrgm/clip/RudeInquisitiveDragonFreakinStinkin?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time
---
not sure what you on about?
---
Ehh, you got to play the last stress test too.
---
Agreed. The people saying we are complaining too much or to not use it if we don't like it clearly don't understand how massive of an issue an add-on like this could potentially become. If a small group (let's say retail noobs who actually make it to 60) starts using a LFG tool, then everyone will be forced to eventually. This is not what classic was about, you needed communication for everything. It's the basis of community. 
---
Sure, finding a group might seem minor in this regard, but if you start chipping away at what made the community in classic through add-ons, we're bound to end up with some kind of Frankenstein game that echoes retail.
---
Let's remove the auction house while we're at it. All trade goes through /2 now.
---
Then make something like this:
---
“Increases your attacking speed by 50 - (your_level - 29)”
---
Roll Troll wear spirit gear and regenerate. ten. hp. per. second. forever.
---
Everybody is a bitch without heals ;)
---
I am one of the people who won't leave... I don't mind waiting 45min.. I also don't mind getting disconnected and wait another 45min.. but if it exceeds 3 hours queue.... I would be a little annoyed.. But I am actually fine with 2 hours queue as well.
---
As an Eve player, this doesn't bother me at all. Just HTFU or let them burn themselves out. Or beat them at their own game. Market PVP is its own form of PVP.
---
In vanilla ppl would create a lfg channel and invite players in the cities. After a while it was automatic to join /lfg
---
I don't really get what people expect Blizzard to do..
---
Opening up the servers early was a great idea and let a lot of people get the names they wanted. Do you want them to allow anyone without a sub to also reserve names? 
---
As for opening up new servers, what they're doing now is working fine and it's ensuring that servers are filling up before new ones are opening up, which to me is a much better idea than throwing out 15 servers and oh shit half of them are low pop. Blizzard has tried encouraging people to swap to give them lower queue times AND it gives them a MUCH higher chance of getting the names they want seeing as fewer people are there, but they can't help it if people are too stubborn or have some sort of server pride before the game's even launched.
---
What Deiwos said, Goons aren't a part of this shitshow. We're all old fucks who can't grok reddit so we sit on forums where you can actually read the flow of a conversation without being beholden to upvotes and downvotes burying important conversation threads.
---
1) Fraternity is not affiliated with Something Awful forums, nor the Goons who are interested in WoW classic. They're a bunch of chinese EVE players who have glommed on to the largest coalition in that game, which is less than 5% goons by weight at this point. Also, 32,000 members is misleading, as it's 32,000 characters, and many people have multiple accounts each with 3 characters, all who are members of that alliance. If you were going by actual numbers, there's probably 500 actual individual players who hail from Something Awful who play in that alliance. The rest are alts or are inactive, and there's no incentive to purge the roles.
---
2) We're a tiny group of old fucks in our 30s and 40s who just want to chill and relive the glory days of Vanilla like dying to Nefarian in BWL, or spending 40 minutes on a corpse run because you got fucked up in AQ40. Don't paint us with the drama brush and go all OMG GOONS TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE GAME! The members of this Classic subreddit alone who are active right now outnumber  the amount of Goons online on their WoW  by 278 to 1. (there's 11,700 redditors reading this sub, to 42 goons reading the WoW subforum over there right now).
---
Cool, that was my pick for endgame as well :)
---
I’ll take arguments that don’t hold up under scrutiny for 20”, Alex!
---
Are there ilvl addons in classic ? I didn t see any.
---
Ty for the link
---
Tailoring matts drop from humanoids.
---
Ye 7.5 dollars down the drain. I'm bankrupt
---
Exactly.
---
Also, unless i get to write "inv" i cant interact with the people in my group.
---
Did you not see the part where the streamer got a whisper which clearly said 'invite please'.
---
Yeah, the convenience of a mage is tempting!
---
Absolutely me to see the conclusion to Endgame
---
This is literally the reason why half my guild is refusing to switch servers. It's very annoying.
---
They should have opened these new servers when they opened the last batch. Everyone that jumped ship to Stalagg are on a high pop server with ques now.
---
It's great aint it
---
Oh, i see. Thanks!
---
Amazing work, feels so live :D
---
Even better - Gnome mage with pink hair :)
---
I know the feeling dude, I'm basically the only one among all my friends that is actually playing games, especially WoW and now excited about Classic. You're not alone, don't worry!
---
Lmao imagine taking WOW so seriously.  Poor guys.
---
it's already dead man.
---
People over reacting
---
Where did you pull that out of?
---
'murica
---
sounds kinda dull... might as well just say "ironman mode:  do the same thing, but do it WAY slower!"
---
They said elitism is MORE prevalent. And memes weren’t called memes 15 years ago, nor were they anywhere near as prevalent as today.
---
There are also custom channels. I know I was in one back in the day that was specifically for high level content. People are going to find ways to make grouping easier and there are more tools than ever to achieve that.
---
Question aside, it's shocking how many people (particularly fellow Brits) think that UK time = GMT regardless of time of year...
---
Launch is:
---
* GMT - 22:00
---
* BST (UK time atm) - 23:00
---
Is Firemaw a PvP server? If yes me and my swedish buddies might join you.
---
You clearly didnt either, those addons were barely used at all and the effect isnt the same at all.
---
Im not against these addons because I dont give a shit but pretending that these were commonly used in classic or even tbc, is just plain retarded and revisionist.
---
won't give any F after all the existential crisis and ptsd this sh\*t gave me
---
I just learned that my fiancée (also met during wow) HAS TO WORK NEXT WEEK  
---
Okay just Monday, Thursday and Friday but doesn't this employer know that classic releases!?  
---
Without my pocket healer and permission to continue leveling I will have to switch to level an alt, therefore denying my chances on being one of the first warriors at 60 and getting invited in a decent raiding guild and becoming the most amazing MT and getting fed \[Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\] and be loved and envied and feared by everyone! - Oh, excuse me. Seems like I happened to be a whiny bitch.  
---
Nevermind. Druid, Paladin or Hunter as alt? I also want a rogue but that dude needs to be twinked like fk.
---
But only one rppvp.
---
lf names (crom,kull,thorgrim) have (belit,thulsa) to trade ;)))
---
New servers coming on the 26th... every server has it's bullshit that's just how it is.  Remember Copperfield the gnome hater on Shattered Hand and he branched onto some other servers too? :)  Good time he paid me 15g as a gnome to jump into the lava in Ironforge.
---
It is indeed. Know that your fellow Swedes have chosen Gehennas (also PvP). It is full though.
---
This is starting to feel more like fantastic promotion rather than actual shaming at this point.
---
His ass.
---
HA! this boy, totally forgot about him. You just had to attack him when he was up.
---
I remember an add on from TBC days which was used for AV groups.
---
Im set on human mage because i hate gnomes. Hopefully it wont matter that much end game? Any good pvp mage guides for clasdic? Also set on engineering/mining.
---
I told my friends I'd do the Wetlands run if either of them got stuck in queue and I didn't.
---
Its probably the only one you'll need.
---
Because Strangle just whispered you and you want to find out what class/level they are?
---
Dude, everyone would have gradually open more realms. The problem is that Blizzard is clueless. If they weren't clueless, they would have open with 4 PvP EN realms, and GRADUALLY add 1-2 when the precious ones were high/full.
---
You see the difference?
---
We got TWO PvP realms at first. 4 days later, 1 more. 2 days after that, 1 more. Now we get 4 more hours before launch. This created a HUGE problem, on the first 2 realms : they are easily over 60k players EACH.
---
If you beloved Blizz would have opened with 4, and add 2 more and 2 more before launch...well, guess what? ALL realms would have been almost evenly populated.
---
It doesn't matter what you say, Blizzard's actions prove that they underestimated Classic, they expected it to flop, and they banked on it.
---
And now, it was proven to be wrong. They are adding FOUR new PvP realms, after they ADDED 2 more...and they started with TWO. If this doesn't scream incompetence and lack of data...I don't know what does.
---
Also, funny thing...THERE ARE STILL NOT ENOUGH REALMS !
---
Ya... You know because you knew the war effort materials on day one...
---
My imagination goes towards your lack of critical thought.
---
Until they make it so it automatically joins a special addon-channel for global invites.
---
Okay Call to Arms is a vanilla add-on it does the same thing, I’m all about #NoChanges so get rid of the LFG addons if you want, but call to arms was there in classic and was a part of the experience for those who remember it. Meeting stones and inn keeps can also help with filling groups since 1.5, and we will be on 1.12. I know this might not be a popular opinion but again I played vanilla and this is a #NoChanges opinion.
---
Haha thanks brotha, last day was today. Now it’s time to unwind and treat the gf like a queen this weekend before I go MIA Monday.
---
luckiest: getting in a very good hardcore raiding guild that netted a few US firsts in sunwell plateau
---
unluckiest: me being 7/8 tier2 (missing chest piece) and watching a full blue/green mage get full tier 2 and me never getting the chest piece bc it never dropped
---
And my &gt;!bunny bracelet!&lt;
---
Not Earth, our planet. Earth, the traditional western element, ground, etc.
---
Didn't think about that use of it. I didn't even use it in vanilla, apart from the occasional, I wonder if this spell is still the same... Yup, pretty much. :D
---
It doesn't show ilevels
---
Personally going for 99 wc while leveling
---
Please do this.  FUCK this addon.
---
Yet another example of how bigotry and idiocy go hand in hand.
---
If they dont vote english on their server, it means the minority Spanish speaker thee will be over represented and more Spaniards will join, hence leading to the exact opposite outcome compared to what they are trying to achieve.
---
Fucking idiots.
---
They have chosen the 2 first PvP realms that went out; Shazzrah(??) and 1 more I think. Myself on the other hand havent chosen any yet and I am afraid of the queues on the full realms.
---
This happened to me in the stress test: Was on a trogg kill quest, in an almost empty cave, saw another player, invited said player, he accepted and then disappeared and a full cave of troggs appeared instead, I was killed horribly
---
Which is why guilds existed.
---
yeah, neither can i
---
Gonna be called that regardless. Really don't care if randos don't get the loot they want. Ohhh yeah your class benefits more from that BiS so let me just sideline my character for all other classes. 
---
The meme has gone from, "huntards pull random mobs and wipe the raids" or "that huntard just rolled on a nature damage staff" to "that huntard sToLe loot he needed but I needed more!!!1" how fucking stupid.
---
Haha thanks, not bad feedback considering I powered through it in like a minute :P
---
It removes the effort of:  
---
Pasting a message in chat every few minutes  
---
Shift Clicking on a person's name  
---
Absolutely gamebreaking.
---
Also I disagree with insta-invite, but let's both be levelheaded here - insta-invite is a joke because I could theoretically be level 51 and ask to be invited to a MC group, and if they have instant invite on i'll just get accepted. I honestly doubt that instant invite will even be used by the majority of people that use the addon.
---
The addon *can* seach globally. This is another thing that I disagree with the addon doing. The catch is that the addon can only advertise to people outside of an areas chat channel to people who have the addon themselves,  so if you are lazy and don't want to run back to a city you are arbitrarily limiting the amount of players you are going to find.
---
Blizzard could break those two things and it would be a huge improvement, but those are side-features of the addon anyway. At it's core the addon just posts in LFG, grabs your whispers and shift-clicks them for you and puts the information into a nice table for you to view.
---
I don't think it's a slippery slope at all. Some dumbasses are going to have shit like ilvl requirements regardless of if there is an LFG tool or not. The addon boils down to a minor convenience for people who are forming pugs and that's it.
---
They shall feel our daggers in their backs.
---
Yeah Troll Warrior for that sweet bow racial.  And don’t forget the pet damage
---
CALLING ALL HORDE: Head to elwyn forest and kill all the boars so the alliance cannot complete their initial quests.
---
They cant layer all of us
---
Off add ons are a slippery slope to dungeon rating
---
My F key usually stands for “Fuuuuuuuck” - usually an interupt or a stun.
---
Calm down, John Henry.
---
Guys, which one is the best solo gold farmer at 60, Warlock, Mage or Rogue? My final decision has come down to this trivial/not so trivial question. :)
---
My F is always an interrupt on whatever class I'm playing, just feels right.
---
Dont worry about it, these groups are an abysmal amount of the total playerbase on each server and cross faction communication this obvious will be punished by Blizzard.
---
Nethergarde Keep is a fucking cool name.
---
Right, though it wasn‘t relevant then.
---
see you back in retail also
---
Don't worry, bro, it's an MMO. You'll meet people during the journey.
---
What? It joins a channel you specify (Trade/General/LFG). You're now complaining about something it doesn't even do yet no needs to...
---
They could, but as they have stated several times; they wanted to go for a conservative approach and add realms over time.
---
That's not how reddit works.
---
This.   Just cook food
---
Trolls don't get a pet damage racial.
---
~~~ twist the knife ~~~
---
its like the hunter meme on top page
---
everyone wants it for himself even tho it doesnt suit them ie not alchemist
---
AoE farming is not for everyone though. Just saying. If you wanna play normal, rogue is def. faster because of less downtime.
---
Great discussion guys!
---
xenophobic
---
adj.	Suffering from xenophobia, a fear or hatred of strangers or foreigners
---
n.	A xenophobe.
---
adj.	suffering from xenophobia; having abnormal fear or hatred of the strange or foreign
---
The definition fits perfectly.
---
The thing is I didn't defend anything, Im from Spain and I always join international guilds and speak english out of respect and because I can. I was only trying to explain to you that spaniards are not speaking spanish in chat because they want to make xenophobes rage, its because they don't speak english, just like english speakers more often than not only speak their native tongue.
---
Spaniards have been asking for servers and translations for our games since forever, but we usually get ignored unlike the germans and french.
---
I'll let you play with your buzzwords now, have a nice day.
---
LFG would actually ruin a great deal imo
---
Mage by far, dm farm is unfuckwithable
---
Oh yea, understandably so..
---
Four new servers will open the day before the launch of the game, so I don't think Firemaw will be "full" at any point. It will probably be the top end of "medium" or "high", which is where you want to be imo.
---
Wait you can swap them and get the proc again??
---
Great idea lol, just got a tablet as well. High time to resub
---
Is there a source on this?
---
There wasn’t a lock out timer in classic was there?
---
Well at least you admit to being selfish and don't claim that the melee weapon is even nearly as important for you as it is for warriors or paladins.
---
Watch to the end of the video and acknowledge you don't need any interaction to group up if both parties have the addon. If both have the addon, it is litterally dungeon finder (LFD) without teleport, cause you don't need to /w the person who's making the group - you get automatically grouped.
---
I hope you'll fine Iron Forge cozy and warm ;)
---
What do you mean ? Everyone speaks your language anyways
---
I never had a problem with a Group finder, just keep it within the same server and don't teleport to the dungeon.
---
You don’t use trade chat. You use world/LFG chat. It’s not hard at all to get groups in vanilla
---
why the fuck would they do that
---
You won't be in the world when you are done queueing, you will be in the character screen
---
Where is mommy??????
---
How can you kill that which has no life?
---
The hunter is the most complex high level class in vanilla. 
---
Billiard has stated this themselves.
---
Can someone walk me through the 0 armor calculation?
---
Im pretty confident there's primary and secondary classifications for armor debuff slots. I'm pretty sure sunder armor is primary and the rest are secondary.
---
What was the debuff sequence with values on private servers and what's the anticipated path to get armor to zero on classic?
---
Ding.
---
I have been pretty good at not getting on the hype train for big releases in the past few years, and I am hesitant to jump on the Classic one as well. I know a lot of people are excited for it, but I just do not feel like it will do what everyone is hoping it will do. My group of friends are always getting hyped up and pre-ordering major releases, and I always do my research to see if it is a game we will play for more than a week... and always end up waiting it out for them to get back onto the old titles we know are tired and trusted.
---
The wow community has changed, people are older, addons like IOscore have poisoned the elitists... I dunno... I am just being cautious. 
---
I was iffy on if I was going to play, but decided I have to give it a shot but we decided to join a new server, with some lesser expectations on reaching endgame and more of a focus on enjoying the leveling experience.
---
I hope it goes well... well enough for Classic BC to be a major discussion... but I just see people who are used to the casual experience of Live not making it too deep into leveling, and a majority of the older players coming to realize that they do not have time to be 15 again.
---
Just my thoughts.. please do not hurt me.
---
Im with you. Gonna disarm you alliance scum all the way!
---
Humans or Gnomes for PvP?
---
This is nonstandard practice.
---
It’s boe, meaning you can view it as a drop of gold if you want.  Everyone put in the work to get it, and it has the exact same value to everyone in the raid, therefore everyone gets a chance to win it.
---
&gt;Into the water
---
&gt;They can’t die
---
One of each is what I am doing. Let one get to a rested zone, switch. That way its less of a drag and less of a change to be bored in a class.
---
That stream was a bit funny to watch tbh.
---
In order for the LFR addon to work the BfA boiz have to get to 60 first .
---
Oh, didnt know that EM / NS thing - the low cast on Ghost Wolf makes a lot more sense for PvP too, no? Instead of bursting one target down every 3 minutes you have actually a lot more mobility?
---
Feels like I am so down to play Shaman! Do you have any insights on making some gold besides maybe farming herbs or something? Don‘t think I can manage to level up two chars soon, so I‘d be stuck on my Shaman.
---
I imagine someone in a dress running through the PvP battlegrounds right now  
---
I may do just that very soon
---
Can you actually put currency with icons into /say?
---
you can have me as a healer if you take my 6 crappy friends to raid with you
---
No I'm not. If you live in a happy relationship for the rest of your lives together, it is safe to say you found the one. 
---
The one is not a special person made just for you. The one is the person you end up with in life. And that person exists if you go out and make it happen. It takes work. I'm not day in that everyone has a magical soul mate out there.
---
They could solve this by asking for "pristine zhevra hooves"
---
6 Hour b-flick and shit tier Anime marathon incoming.
---
they wanna control and monitor who learns to use guns because they are at risk of having guns used against them
---
I believe the Bloodvine set is BoE but you need Tailoring to benefit from the 3-piece set bonus, if memory serves me correctly. Mmm all that +spell hit from that set is very tasty.
---
There's a difference between "I wouldn't purposefully gimp my group" and "omg too hard". For me anyway.
---
I remember farming at Tyrs Hands back in the day with my hunter, even fully equipped with gear between aq40/naxx stats it wasn't a breeze. They can hit hard if you aren't careful.
---
Any decent group nowadays would just set up marks.
---
Needs more Breaking Benjamin
---
where? all i see on this sub day after fucking day is 'retail bad classic good upvotes to the left;
---
you're part of the hivemind dude, you're not in any position to objectively rate 'discussion'. you're sitting in the middle of the circle jerking off your neighbors

That glass is too close to the edge, it makes me uncomfortable.

Extra manual effort == extra incentive to be a good group member.  
---
You can downplay it all you want, but the convenience of this addon is just something that enables the bit by bit removal of what makes vanilla, vanilla.  These inconveniences make the game what it is.
---
It's definitely a slippery slope.  It's basically saying "we don't like the inconveniences of vanilla so we're going to keep hacking away at them to provide a more retail-like experience".  It'll happen slowly.  First you have LFG addons that make interactions less and less human(and more global), then you have ilvl trash, then whatever other garbage they can come up with.  
---
Grouping *should* be somewhat "annoying" or "time consuming" to a degree.  It makes you want to find new friends, guild members, etc, so you don't have to go through the process over and over again.  It makes the community more intertwined.  LFG is just a tinder style pump and dump type thing that doesn't help create meaningful interactions, because you can just turn around and LFG your group back.  Mutual struggle helps create friendships.
---
If you don't have the time to play classic, that's totally fine.  That's what retail, and all of its QOL changes is for.
---
Make all the characters. Reserve all the names.
---
And you can only use auto invite on custom groups not dungeon groups because it's pointless to have it for dungeons
---
Oh yeah I got me thinking about retail for a sec
---
Why is it not the same?
---
Sounds like Alliance would like this name. I hope they move there and Horde remains :P
---
Thank you.
---
There's a quest reward in lock modan as well.  I believe it's either the escort to the dig site or one of the quest at the dig site.
---
It's originally /assist until you rebind it. It's not that useful anyways since nowadays you just mark the targets.
---
This is wonderful, really wish she looked like that
---
The opposite in this example. So "The Barrens Oases" is the first quest from the prechain followed by "The Forgotten Pools" and so on
---
F is for a on use dps trinket...
---
People are just whining to whine. Most of this sub didn't even play vanilla when it was current. They think standing around spamming trade for an hour to get a group together was cool, and fostered some sense of community or some shit. In reality, it was just part of the game, but an annoying one. As most of us who played vanilla are now virtually guaranteed to be close to 30, with jobs and likely families - anything that might help me maximize my max of a couple hours a night of playtime is welcome. The problem was never a LFG tool. The problem was it being cross server, it automatically transporting you to the dungeon, and sending you back where you came from. A huge part of the fun of classic was emergent game play. Going to UBRS and getting tanked by a 5 man stealth group, somehow fighting them off and chasing them down through the mountain. You don't get that on retail. You don't even talk to your party members.

Would have been cool to get an answer to this instead of the same layering question and the same realm population question over and over again.

And that kids is why you don't cheap out on life insurance.

They should reduce the drop rate to make up for the time saved by all those quest und speedlevel addons.
---
How fun is leveling mage? 1-10? I am considering option having an mage alt. All I know is raiding (MC+BWL) with mage is FB, FB, FB, FB :(
---
Indeed but people are stupid and prolly will use the addon anyway.
---
Yup, "LFM flask reserved". At least on private servers reserving items was constantly advertised. I think it can go overboard quite a bit, sometimes it seems everything is reserved lol. But everyone is free to whatever loot rules they want if they create a party.
---
One again, that’s one bad tattoo. Bad lines, bad position for the composition, not deep enough so it will be blurry in 15 years top, shading is not really good too

Tou and me have very very different experiences of vanilla lol
---
Mafia vs cartel was some entertaining shit, but everyone else just got fucked in the process
---
If you hold down ALT click on a character name in chat and then press F4 it invites them to your party.
---
I'm warning you that this is where it will end up.
---
cool, so you'll stay away from classic then right? i can already tell that'll be a boost for the community
---
You need to get on My Level.
---
F is Strafe right.
---
Move with ESDF, instead of WASD. It gives you extra hotkeys to use on both sides of your left hand.
---
Next Level Shit.
---
Which is exactly what made this game so much fun back when it launched
---
What kind of noob do you have to be if F is still undbound lol
---
Only on PvP servers.
---
Fuck you too.
---
&gt; What they did is the best approach by far.
---
2 PVP and 2 PVE servers initially. I'm sure whoever made that decision had a clue what he/she was doing.
---
This. Any good tank should be able to mark targets. just decide order and which marks are cc and who is responsible for the cc on the different marks.
---
Blackhand Doomsaw plz
---
According to all sources I can find (like classic.wowhead), almost all tailoring things are actually BOE, including Bloodvine (but not Robe of the Archmage). The Flarecore stuff is also BOE. The only problem I see is that the Bloodvine set specifically has the set bonus locked behind 300 tailoring skill. I was planning to skip tailoring and just buy this gear instead.
---
U dont get what that eventually means for everyone on that particular server.
---
Gnome is not to bad to reach the human zone. You can Take the deeprun train from IF to SW. Protip for nightelves: die right away and do the running in wisp form for the 50% movespeed.
---
Ye
---
Taking 1handers away from rogues/warriors is silly, but on the flip side you get things like ashkandi as hunter prio, might be a tiny bit worse than 1h statsticks, but its still a hell of a lot better than taking away 1handers from your melee dps
---
Nothing as bad in Westfall. Closest thing in Aliance side is probably the Tough Condor Meat for the Redridge Goulash.
---
Yes!
---
Windfury.
---
Either do or do not.
---
There is no Draenei.
---
Whitemane is anagram for New item, ha!

Looks like you'll have an hour and 5 minutes. I could take a shit, shower, shave, and mow my lawn in that amount of time.

Sounds reasonable to me.

What that wasn't me lmao

Fuck off casual
---
Was another post here about them dropping 4 new pvp servers both in Europe and NA
---
As rogue you spam sinister strike and eviscerate and keep slice and dice up thats it.
---
My girlfriend is already judging me hard for just talking about it
---
Looks like someone forgot to roll Paladin.
---
I hear that.
---
Sorry that they forced you into subbing for a stupid name no one in the game will ever give a fuck about.
---
Greenskin
---
no
---
Because none of that really matters in Classic. There aren't mythic+ 5 mans, and the 5 mans that are out there can be done in blues and greens, and you can certainly carry someone who's not great. So yeah, I'd rather have a casual conversation with someone and invite them if they are 60 and seem like a nice person. You guys keep missing the point I've been making the entire time... I'd rather have that personal conversation than an add-on. I'd also rather teach someone a Classic dungeon, because they're way easier than a mythic+, than to just exclude everyone based on an add-on. And about the current RaiderIO, there's not much difference between a 1900 and a 2000, which is the point I made. But people are so bent on the numbers anymore than even a 100 score difference will exclude you from an invite. And if you haven't the time to grind them and grind them, you fall behind and suffer when you do log on because of it. Denying that that's a reality is just wrong.
---
Just downloaded it myself, looks wonderful
---
I’m convinced! The video did a great job at explaining what it will/will not do. And it looks much more vanilla-like than everyone is making it out to be.
---
People are so thick that they cant comprehend what the effects of lfg addons are. If enough people use them then it becomes the standard and then you are forced to adopt it or you cant play.
---
To give a serious answer to the question, you don't know. 
---
But the probability of the player without good gear being bad/inexperienced is at least as high for the one with good gear. 
---
So regardless whom you pick you have roughly the same chance to get a dud, but if you get lucky and get a good player he/she will be more effective with good gear.
---
Your website shows "The Platinum Discs" (Uldaman) as being Horde-only, which it absolutely is not.
---
discord? We're going back to ventrilo dude
---
I am going to DM you "pls explain raw data to me".
---
It was a very good time for most casters, so I sold it for a pretty penny... don’t recall how much though
---
Ha.  And all the objections will come from people who never acknowledge that lfg addons were in use during vanilla.  
---
“But its just not the pure experience.”
---
For everyone that objects, I expect they never use any addon, because that would impugne the purity of the game.
---
Nice try, I use death grips.
---
I'll ask around if anyone was in Moon Squad.
---
Garrosh was the best warchief.
---
Ushaka (After the African warlord) - it just seems to fit the setting. 
---
Grimnir (Odin) - Awesome if you can get it.
---
All dps classes have an extremely simple rotation or priority system in PVE.
---
However, Mages have a special role to play in Vanilla, one that sets you apart from other DPS: Decurse duty. Means on some bosses you playstyle will move from a pure dps to healmode - except you dispel instead of healing. Some people actually avoid the Mage class because of that, especially those who want to dps and nothing else.
---
Apart from that, Mages are the most reliable Aoe class in the game, which adds another layer of complexity to your dps gameplay (compared to Rogues, who just stick to the boss with heavy single target damage).
---
I can't tell you what is more fun, but Mage is easily the most diverse dps class in Vanilla. I'm not sure what you mean by 1-10 though, that's like 30 minutes of gametime. Mages are definitely easier to level than rogues, though.
---
&gt;/r/classicwow 
---
"All specs have a niche! Play what you want! Paladins and druids are the best 5 man tank!"
---
&gt;also /r/classicwow 
---
This classist crap.
---
You say words like pretty useless and do well, neither are necessarily true of a ret paladin. They are just middle of the road and despite attempts to be otherwise, they can’t keep up with everyone else. 
---
So you’re not useless and you’ll never be amazing, but you’ll just be less than optimal than if you went as one of the best paladin pve specs, holy.
---
Useless is too strong a word.
---
You will still do decent dps, and bring Blessings.
---
How decent your dps will depend on your guildmates.
---
If it's a more casual guild, you can tryhard yourself and do really good dps compared to them.
---
If it's a tryhard/hardcore guild, you will do mediocre or worse dps, if they even bring you.
---
The good news is, Casual guilds can easily clear all the content through the first 5 phases! So play the Ret Paladin and find a guild that takes you.
---
I recommend you ask a guy called TeamViewer, Google him
---
this might be one of the most important pieces of info on one of these cheatsheets
---
Great work my man !
---
We did that too. Installing Call To Arms didn't disable any of the standard UI behaviour.
---
The thing is that Classic+ is a pipedream, ClassicTBC has a real chance of happening. The only thing campaigning for Classic+ is accomplishing is detracting from the efforts of getting ClassicTBC.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE new development for Classic, but it's never happening.
---
I used RingMenu on Vanilla private servers on Mage and Warlock.. the addon was a godsend. You're able to hide all those utility spells on the circular bar and assign a hotkey to open/hide it as needed. One of my personal favorites. Awesome QoL addition to your Vanilla experience. Not sure if there is an updated version for Classic yet though.
---
Finally some shaman love ! Great job
---
Not right now you don't
---
To be fair, pretty much every class is more boring than a rogue when it comes to raiding.
---
3 hours? You are not gonna reach 60 before next year lol
---
I got two epics off the same normal world mob once. They both sucked, but the odds are astronomically small.
---
They need to seriously kill addons cross-communicating with eachother ingame.
---
I'm not going quite the blind route, I'm gonna use Wholly and Grail addons for quest info as someone suggested. Apparently it doesn't tell you everything like Questie does, but still shows what area has quests to offer (and what level). I just don't want to completely mess up quest order and end up having to grind mobs for multiple levels.
---
I played priest for most of vanilla and somewhat into tbc, so probably not. I'd like something a little different. I still love healing, which is why I'm considering druid. I'm much more of a raider than a PvPer, and hope I'll have the time to avoid being a filthy casual ;)
---
I didn't even know about the add-on until people complained here
---
Gnome for their escape artist ability iirc. It has situational utility, but +rep doesn't help pvpers much.
---
Are you me? Horde mage browsing classic reddit at work. This is literally me as im typing
---
Trust nobody, not even yourself
---
Gnome.
---
Sounds like you want to buy the name “ArmsWarrior” fro me.
---
Is Uncle Sam illiterate?
---
You didn't ask for input...
---
Downvotes inc but there are loads of other addons that reduce player interactions and alter the Vanilla experience like quest helper addons - you won’t ask anyone where things are because they’re already on your map. But there’s no problem there? I probs won’t use it but I don’t think addons should be policed like what you guys are suggesting when there are already channels on server discords that will do the exact same thing outside of the game.
---
Agreed. I'm on the east coast and I'm even considering ruining my play schedule to be on that realm.
---
If it's a simple UI so you don't have to repeatitly type in trade chat and allows to read things more easily why not, but ... in no time there will be gear score, raider.io, on top of it, etc and the vicious circle begins... Again.
---
Maybe just an UI to simplify communication done by blizzard , and the rest of the lookalike add-ons are banned or it just gets banned from the get go.
---
This is a pandora box, we don't want to open it again with classic IMO.
---
What's better for middle Americans, east or west for latency?
---
Gnomes, especially on melee classes.
---
Ret? Might aswell play fortnite, i had to roll rogue for that reason
---
I love how you are the only person mentioning this over and over. I dont recall anyone ever even mentioning this in vanilla.
---
Nice try, you’ll be dead when you find the button.
---
ok what if enough people didnt use it
---
If you wanted to test out classic without paying there are private servers that are still up
---
For me it's classic until CP2077 comes out...
---
Huh thinking the same about PVE and avoiding being casual but damn real life can be tough haha. Well just a few more days. Have fun!
---
Doesn't it only make group finding easier and you still gotta travel there and stuff? I don't really see a problem since the worst aspect of retail LFG isn't there.
---
Playing vanilla for 2 weeks? Hahahaha you're in for an awakening
---
You can only play WoW Classic with an active subscription or game time.
---
Is there a reason why this has a Zygor fill to it just looking at the screen shot
---
The day my RL friends pulled me away from EQ2 and into Azeroth.
---
Paladin - Holy  
---
FML
---
Also worth noting: Skinning mats tend to be dirt cheap in the early days because of people leveling with skinning as a profession until they hit max level.
---
It doesn't matter it has the potential for abuse so it shouldn't exist and people will take it into account for raids, later raids in particular.
---
Yeah that argument is super common and I don't fucking get it. Most people would always rather run with a known good player, or one they just generally have a good time with, than one that they know nothing about. These people must have had really hollow friendships if the only reason they didn't think of other players as NPCs was a lengthy wait to assemble the group.
---
I remember getting both dal'rend's and my first epic BOE, shash of mercy, on the same UBRS run.
---
The biggest difference for leveling as a mage vs a rogue is gear. Rogues need good gear badly. Where as a mage can really get by with pretty much anything. I'll be leveling a mage first and then a rogue after since I'll be able to give the rogue some good items :).
---
Yesterday in my guilds raid   
---
"Whos gonna play classic?" and there was 1 person, all the rest said "no time for that anyways"  
---
So I assume both games will have their fair playerbase with a bunch of players swapping in and out patchwise.
---
&gt;every fight doesn't have a move or die instantly mechanic.
---
Up to Naxx?
---
Maybe shitters used SB regularly in Vanilla but i promise you Classic PvP Shadowbolt is almost never used.
---
29 and now 44. 15 years is a big hunk of anyone's life.
---
No.  
---
I suggest you start in a few days, because the servers arent up, yet.
---
Ret is a hybrid if anything, the dps is shite
---
just like we’re never getting classic? defeatist attitude isn’t helpful. we are already getting one or the other (as stated on their site), push for what you actually want and it’s more likely we will get it.
---
&gt; close to 30
---
man I was almost 30 when Vanilla came out.
---
So because you were unaware of its existence, it didn't exist?
---
The hassle of trying to find mythic groups in retail is what killed the game for me. I would remain longer with a proper "mythic-finder" in the game.
---
I utterly despise the elitism of most group selection processes and having to basically beg around for party invites.
---
If there is a group finder addon, I will definitely use it.
---
I love classic but I also loved the summoning stone
---
I'm 6'1 and like 80kgs.
---
There's plenty of protein too, I think I get like 30g of protein for breakfast, about there.
---
For real though, some pretty bad players got carried to full T1/2 back in ye olden days.
---
1) I never even mentioned shadowbolt, that was OP.
---
2) while you were searing pain/conflagging your targets, what were they doing exactly? Target dummying?
---
Rolling a priest soooooooooo nope don’t need it ... all cloth goes to tailoring
---
NE Hunter was my first 60, always found myself wishing I had levelled an undead rogue instead, so Undead Rogue for me this time.
---
It's not cross-realm, is it really that big of a deal?
---
I spy a bfa baby
---
 Incendius is the play boys. BIS realm name and our last chance at securing dank character names.
---
Probably close to accurate, but that doesn't mean they won't shit up LFG while you're trying to build a group of people to spend 6 hours in BRD working on getting parts from your pre-raid BIS set.
---
Even playing a mage normally, they're faster than rogues. Rogues are more gear-reliant and have less options for dealing with multiple mobs. Mages have downtime, but so do rogues, as rogues need to eat/bandage between fights.
---
Humans grant a mage nothing of significant value. Perception is decent if you know a rogue just stealthed around you, but with a 3 minute cooldown it isn't spammable and really falls off.
---
Gnomes on the other hand have escape artist which is invaluable in PVP, especially on a 1 minute cooldown.  a warrior hamstrings you, rogue poison, horde mage frost nova you escape artist and can escape much more easily. In addition, 5% intellect is nothing to scoff at at higher gear levels.
---
In short, gnomes all the way.
---
I'll give you one of my old ones:
---
Bludwyrm
---
Can you have too many locks? Afaik its the 2nd least popular class
---
And in some fights like golemagg you can use lots
---
Its hunters with more competition
---
And when you're in the taverns
---
Worst part is working together with the opposing faction. Literally makes me sick
---
Such a nice picture
---
Would Love to carry a bagpack ingame

 It's not like they couldn't use ALL of the channels at the same time, lmfao.  Then people start hearing about the addon and guess what, now no one actually forms groups and it's all done automatically.   Might as well go play retail.  
---
You're literally banking on the idea that more than 1% of the population won't use an addon that makes life 100% easier...LOL!  That number will grow exponentially over time as more people talk about it.  It would be catastrophic to the community towards the later stages of the game.

It's basically a chat parser that people misunderstood, because they watched a 15 second twitch video without any context. This isn't some fancy game breaking tool. It just spams a channel you specificy (lfg/trade/general). Auto invite is disabled by default and only works if someone whispers you 'invite please', which most people will disable.

Fun and educational! Helped young me in learning and understanding how to behave and act in social situations.

Mafia guilds are all pserver tryhards that have done all of the raids and some have even achieved rank 14. They will get the content done, but that's typically not even a priority. Server control and dominance is.

Was not needed in Vanilla, and it is not needed in Classic.
---
you can also theoretically try retail now, which is the perfect way to really appreciate classic
---
Well what's the question?

Just the Reddit poll on here but currently Herod is 60% horde, 40% alliance according to the reddit poll with nearly 4000 Herod answers

This is the classic I came back to play!

*More work?*
---
What are your questions?
---
Thank God. I wasnt sure if I needed to be a certain rep to be able to do those quests
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Leatherworking? You mean skinning, right?
---
Agree strongly. I loved running dungeons in vanilla.  I made a ton of friends, there was lots of communication, we made plans. When I tried playing again later, no one even talked to each other. If I didn't immediately pull, someone else would just pull so we would keep going.  Got boring real quick.
---
I’m all about being on mr bigglesworth

Gank the shit out of everyone so much, that when they hear stealth sound, they will instantly logout.

actually i stopped inviting hunters to my groups on private servers... i havent grouped with a hunter in years.. and have had no problems in dungeons or raids
---
Thanks. Why specifically are these two more beneficial? I’m assuming gnomes for the hitbox.
---
sounds fishy
---
source?
---
Disclaimer: im not planning to use it, but let people play how they want. Buncha babies
---
Only buy what you need for damage aka mage buys frostbolt/firebolt frost nova upgrades and leaves most of the rest to rank 1. Same for healers you dont need highest rank available.
---
I loved to run 5/10 man random - but as the one, that wants to fill up the group and start the dungeon, every help counts.
---
Do you know, that those Addons already existed in Classic? I used them, i liked thema lot...because I was the idiot that stayed in Ironforge to find members for the group - while the others started to grind some shit while searching for maybe 1-2 hours? (i had a ubrs key, did a lot of runs)
---
I /who'd for hours and whisperd people a fucking copy&amp;paste string: "Hey, we are looking for a Healer for UBRS, wanna group up? 7/10, have key, no druid yet"
---
I loved the World Chat. Combined with an Addon i could just simply do my things and look up, if there is someone lfg/m. 
---
Not the addon is your problem - its the people. 
---
If they have bad manners - ignore them.
---
Yes server culture effects your individual experience
---
Keep up with lockpicking skill.
---
Always make sure you have poisons
---
I have no stance on this matter, but...
---
How can you fail to see it affecting the people not using it, if it is used by an ever increasing amount of players on their server... It WILL affect them.
---
Please don't ever say qanter, it will give me qancer.

[These look blue to me](https://i.imgur.com/EzvF56t.png)

I want to attempt to run a build somewhere along the lines of what is shown above. The idea would be to be an off-healer but focus on attempting DPS. So to the questions:
---
1) Do you think I'd ever be invited to a Raid?  
---
2) Would the DPS be anywhere near respectable?
---
3) Would I be capable of saying "I'm a healer" with this build?
---
Appreciate any feedback!
---

Wow I legit spun a warrior protection and that's what I was planning on playing. Mind = blown
---
Qanter
---
You used wod Tier sets in Legion for feral too... Iirc there Were several Cases of OP Tier sets
---
Ok clear.
---
And  "Leaders of the Fang" is after "Mara Wildmane" ?
---
I would leave the alliance for this warchief.. there I said it.
---
Me too buddy. I finally just settled on rogue so i won't get laughed at.
---
yes this is an unpopular opinion.
---
It’s pretty close yeah. Some major differences being its obviously not cross-realm and it can’t be abused for phasing. I don’t think it’s some evil addon that gets anywhere close to the things that brought WoW down. Many people are acting as if it like dungeon/raid finder and will teleport you inside an instance from your capital city
---
And if you want to play a lot of PvP later, make sure you farm blinding powder.
---
well, if everyone else uses this addon, you kinda are forced to use it otherwise you wont see any group looking for people because they are all inside the addon.
---
Cause we aint american casuals!
---
Okay buddy I'm going to explain this to you one last time.
---
The tool basically messages \[General | Trade | LFG\] a message like : " TANK LFM NEED 3 DPS" every 3 minutes.
---
If you enable Auto-Invite you will send a player an invitation automatically ONLY if they whisper 'Invite Please' to you (as the party leader).
---
If they select join on a party in the UI all it does is send the party leader a whisper 'Invite Please'.
---
In the video you are referencing you can clearly see the invite please message in the chat log. This isn't some fancy tool. It basically parses the chat log that is it.
---
========
---
Why would you not create a special LFG channel for this?
---
Most people won't auto-invite it's useless. This tool is mostly great for managing your  \[General | Trade | LFG\] message spams. WHICH EVERYONE CAN SEE. If you have this tool or not. As someone who uses this tool it's to my benefit for everyone to be able to see it because not everyone will install this (they don't need to). They will still whisper me an invite if they want to join.
---
This tool does NOT AUTO-GROUP.
---
Odd. I got the two character names I wanted a bit ago. Coincidence?
---
More like turqoise :-(. Anyway Thrall has perfect eyes!! And that face is the worst.
---
Every class is going to have that though.

Rogues share alot of gear with Warriors etc
---

dear god i want that cthun eye
---
I honestly have no idea. I haven't played Vanilla back in the day. But so much changed from the old Vanilla API to the retail one. And since Classic is running on the Legion's Engine API, I suppose they still need to re-build it for Classic. I'm using the Twitch App to download addons and updating them is a breeze.
---
See my comment, you and /u voltaire155 were too quick for me! Lol
---
Please share them with us I only have 5 of them :D
---
Is this a screenshot from the oregon trail?
---
I can do that on my own.  Don't need to join the family to flip stuff.

---

---
Call of Duty.
---
Press F to Pay Respects.
---
Honestly I think you and others are romanticizing these "social connections" you're so worried about. I dont think people are suddenly going to become best friends from a difficult dungeon run.
---
And as for finding a new group member without leaving the dungeon, we'll see how much y'all like that when your tank suddenly disconnects after 30 minutes in BRD.
---
All in all, I think y'all are overreacting.
---
Helps too if you find a guild with like minded people. I found a guild and we are all casual and will be taking our time doing just this. I have gone hardcore on too many games, i dont want to ruin this game for myself the second time around. I actually did have a good time just reading the quests. I may still install an addon for questing if im with other people i dont know.  
---
Happy hunting all!
---
So you're pretty thin as well. Weird.
---
The reason I brought up protein was because it sounded like you aren't a bodybuilder that needs insane amount of calories. I guess the rest of your meals are way less calorie dense then or you have physical job / very active lifestyle.
---
"Only" 100k downloads before the game is even out? I "guarentee" this will be a lot higher once people are actually doing dungeons.
---
Dude its going to be tied to ilvl and experience, come on it does not belong in classic.

That could be even better but I would say there’s almost no chance of that. With the classic team they aren’t building something from scratch, it’s just getting their original code back into some working order, TBC would be the same. I can’t see them developing a new xp for classic unless BFA was the final expansion for retail wow which isn’t a great idea. Who knows though, classic could be that huge that it’s feasible to have two entirely separate teams working on new expansions
---
6 secconds downtime even with high raid gear... traah tier sadly
---
You are the real deal, can I join your guild and learn the classic true ways from you?
---
Well hot damn
---
I think what people are upset about isn't the add on,  but the qol the add on provides. It may sound stupid, but because groups were tedious to form and refill made dungeons more of a commitment. People are less concerned about the raiding add-ons because less people actually did raiding back the hen, but everyone grouped.
---
If people want to use this add on they will, and that's fine. But part of the charm of vanilla grouping was that sense overcoming these artifical hurdles. Removing these hurdles slowly strips away what the game was meant to be, a giant time sink you can play with other people.
---
Competing with all the other druids for that raid spot.
---
I just checked the addons page and he is going to update it so auto-invite only works for custom.

Don´t think they can ban that addon. All it does is to read out the chat for keywords, scan the class and put it in a database. Then it sends invites. Bossmod addon can also send autoinvites. 
---
It might even be useful in phase 1 when every server is a megaserver with 10k pop all using the same chat. the problem is once the new pop is set to 3k people already use the addon.

who cares?
---
The troll  bet zeroing is fucking huge damage. It’s like a second bloodlust just for being troll. It’s just more spells faster and will greatly increase damage. I myself am going for elemental shaman, so a troll is a must. 
---
As for gnome, the int buff they get is huge raw stats for casters obviously. It’s the best facial for pure dps on alliance. They are also really good for pvp with their gnome get out of jail free card. 
---
Undead is great for pvp too, but no berserk will hurt you a lot for sure. You will want to have it. It’s another icy veins. It’s just such a must imo for any horde caster.
---
Yeah, that would be awesome! I may be wrong with this, but I remember there being a zone far up the north end of the Eastern Kingdoms that was on the map but was inaccessible?
---
They did say they'd consider TBC depending on the success of the classic release...we can hope.
---
RP is for losers.
---
I guess it depends how willing certain people are, I most likely will be outleveling my mates, but if they need someone for a lower level dungeon I'll help them out, but I'm not really in a rush to hit 60
---
I always wonder if the people who say this ever played private or understand the modern meta
---
Glad I could help!
---
Probably wasn't a PvP server, usually PvP server is dominated by horde and vice versa
---
Literally waiting until Monday (fuck-a-name) to play longer on sub days and to get 54 dollars more of Peanut Butter for breakfast
---
on pve realms no
---
in pvp realms only until phasing is removed
---
and then it still depends on GMs banning them
---
Also was a lot easier to manage on pservers, being free and all. Still very possible but that $$ is a bit of a deterrent
---
Yeah I didn’t hear about this add on until all these morons started spamming the subreddit about it. 
---
I’m excited to use it, I’m a busy guy and I don’t have time to waste looking for a group.
---
Its been updated for Classic

Exactly. A specific addon can't be banned, they can only ban functionalities. Blocking things like sending invites would make it a bit more tedious, but ultimately these addons will exist for as long as there is a way to communicate using addons. And while they *could* block that entirely, I don't see it happening.
---
Don't you know? Being the owner of your server's discord is gonna gain you lots of fame, loot, chicks and even Scarab Lord!!!!
---
&gt; ...to teach Blizz the fucking lesson once and forever that it's not the *industry changing* it's them who really fucked up the game  
---
This is the ultimate truth. Players did not change, the game SUX. Players did not quit because they suddenly got in-love with Candy Crush and other BS mobile games. The young generation isn't playing MMORPGs because the BR games are better.
---
The MMORPGs of today STINK. It's not the industry that is changing. It's the AAA companies that fucked up their games.

You got your opinion, doesnt change it though. Play like you want.

Its because they only released 2 pvp servers (eu) when it was so obvious that it was way too little and now everyone is set on those realms
---
This is a great idea
---
Watch some YouTube guides, run-through, tips and tricks. That’s my best advice to you. Make sure you’re not watching any private server stuff.

Thanks for the info, I was going to play priest but looking at warlock now! Guessing I’ll pick up wands when I can

Cross faction collusion is against the TOS.  They won’t be able to do that in the real game.

---
Some would argue no addons, but I prefer to use Questie. It shows quest locations and other information just like retail does. Probably the best addon you'd want. TidyPlates is a nice little UI addon that shows debuff timers on enemies and makes the unit plates look nice, and finally I use Dominos as an actionbar addon. It cleans up your interface so you can see more of the world. If you want more cosmetic addons, check out [CurseForge.com](https://CurseForge.com) .

RP PVP will have less faction imbalance? Never played on one just wondering

you really need to give people more to work with.
---
Addons? There are plenty, what do oyu think you need to have a smooth time leveling? 
---
You want to play dps? Great, all nine classes in the game can be dps, some better, some worse. If you can't even give a preference whether you want to be melee or ranged, how are people supposed to guide you to a class choice?

Early in beta they didn't have a lock-out but that was quickly remedied, there is a 5 instance per hour lock-out in classic.
---
People love to force their opinions on others. It’s the way of the internet now

Why do you want to level as arcane? It's an oddly specific request, you've peaked my curiosity.

Peak capitalism.

Gets a summon. Drops group. /ignore
---
Pretty much how I'm feeling. I know it's impossible to wipe everyones memories and all the data of vanilla out of people's brains but jeez I wish people would chill a bit. I totally expected some people to no life to 60 and min/max everything with help of memory and guides on the internet, but it's really seeming like half of the community is doing this.
---
Meanwhile I played through vanilla content and did hundreds of MC/BWL runs etc but you can bet your ass I'm not going to remember what every 5 man or raid boss does or know leveling routes (I'm actually going alliance for the first time so I don't know their zones well). It's going to be super fun to be totally clueless or have an "ohh yeah!" moment. Just be surprised by content I did 15 years ago.
---
I'm holding out for hope that the hardcore crowd really is the minority still and all the casual population is waiting to sub on monday.
---
It doesn't auto group. It's a chat parser. You still need to make sure that you're getting 1 tank / 1 healer / 3 dps.
---
Less control with longer frost nova cd and no cold snap. less survivability without ice barrier.
---
Than.
---
Not everyone uses the LFG channel. That’s why people would go back to a town so they could access trade. Also taking away any investment required can make it easier for people to quit the runs wasting everyone’s time.
---
Sit in front of the bank or run/jump in circles while you chat with them on voice coms
---
You shouldn't be downvoted for this, because the OP's original claim was incorrect.
---
&gt; same as retail, 10 / realm; 50 per account
---
Classic is NOT the same as Retail because Retail allows you to create 50 characters on the same realm if you want.  That was your point, and people don't seem to be getting that.
---
Then.
---
You will most likely still be grouping with people who do. More often than not you probably won't even know who is or isn't using the tool.
---
this is how gangz start lmao
---
... You do realise that a "slippery slope" is literally a fallacy?
---
Well, came away R11 and later Merc Glad, but I suppose I'll take the word of someone who played the simplest class to PvP with.
---
Its a cottoncandy walk to lv 20 past 25 is the time when things spice up
---
For geniue vanilla experience you should try playing without any addons. Finding the quests via various breadcrumbs in main cities was part of the fun. For more modern approach use Questie addon. But even then be prepared to run across the continents between various zones to find quests. Classic doesnt frontload quests in form of hubs and its beautiful
---
How long have you been waiting to repost it lol?
---
&gt; Retail WoW is how it is because of a shift of design philosophy and shifting of the target demographic, the huge QoL changes didn't help the situation but they alone didn't make the game how it is now.
---
Bullshit.
---
&gt;Straw Man.
---
Supporting garbage makes you garbage.
---
&gt;Pressing Paste and Shift Clicking is mere seconds but if it's an unnecessary process then why not cut down on it. I just wanted to try and convince you because over this post you have done nothing but repeat the same flawed points over and over again and I had hoped you were just misunderstanding what the addon actually did. I see now that was not the case.
---
"unnecessary process".  To you maybe, but to people that want to maintain the effort required, nope.  The addon is TRASH and leads to very bad things.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
---
&gt;Then they get invites to groups but still have the social interaction of literally everything outside of getting an invite.
---
Nice cope.
---
&gt;LFD is a service that puts you into a braindead dungeon with a group of completely random people and tells you to complete the dungeon. LFG is a tool that helps you find groups. Not the same thing.
---
It's nearly the same thing, both are convenience promoting garbage that lead to the destruction of social interaction.
---
&gt;I do understand the potential ramifications
---
You clearly don't.
---
&gt;I also think that this addon specifically is not one of the things to lead to any major ramifications.
---
Yet most of the classic community does, amazing.
---
&gt;Let me know if you need any other conversational basics digested for you.
---
Learn what a straw man is before you try to lecture people on conversational basics 😄
---
Here's a tip: If you don't like the addon, don't use it. Problem solved!
---
This is a movie rental store? I thought these all closed down. It’s like you’re in a time machine
---
Im playing warlock and I'll make money out of people that don't use the addon charging for the ss and summons
---
Anyone can
---
le jewish dino mafioso will claim your gold and DKP
---
Lmfao- but yeah I never played hunter back in Vanilla. I am primarily playing pvp so I’m hoping I can put up good competition
---
They learn from their mistakes and make retail fun again.
---
Orc's use gnome corpse's as flesh lights.
---
Look at how POE used to do trade, we posted to the forums using special code for bots to scrape into a useful trade UI. We had seperate programs to post sales, and a website for buying, then a plug in for the game to made trading faster etc. It is going to happen one way or another, the tech has progressed to far. Better to have it in game in a way that still uses chat.
---
It's an Onyxia challenge I guess
---
Something could have existed in vanilla and still not be in the spirit of Classic. 
---
I hate the argument that just because it existed in 2006, it should be allowed
---
This video has convinced me to download it and try it out. Gonna go grab it now. Thanks!
---
I got druid feral
---
too difficult
---
then shadow priest kinda so and so
---
then a fire mage yea its gonna be lit in MC
---
4th try combat rogue which is pretty much what  I was thinking tho it doesnt say sword or dagger which is a massive choice
---
hopefully they will speak english in the tradechat
---
Imo if I was given a chance to play classic fresh I wouldn't follow a guide, just enjoy it and go at your own pace and do whatever you want.
---
If you'd rather follow a guide there are plenty on YouTube and posted on this subreddit. 
---
Gl hf!
---
I went on a motorcycle yesterday for the first time ever and the first couple minutes were terrifying. 
---
I thought I wasn't gonna be able to play WoW. :(
---
RIP US-Archimonde call out threads.
---
I can't believe this is actually thing some people might want in classic. It kinda defeats the purpose... Kinda like in the recent Q&amp;A where they asked if they did Wrath if they would take out dungeon finder from that expansion. The devs were like maybe depending on player feedback etc. So even the devs know the detrimental effects of the group finder. Yeah it makes content more easily accessible, but it absolutely makes bad behavior easier to get away with and takes away the sense of community and world. DEATH TO DUNGEON FINDER!
---
Lfg addon will be fun :)
---
This doesn't automate any processes, its not dumbing down the game like many of modern wows QoL changes. 
---
If you really want to deep dive into the this line of thinking, nobody stream, nobody look at wow head, install any addons that weren't in vanilla, limit your frames to 15 and you must be at 300+ ms.
---
It just a bit silly, the whole #nochanges has gone out of hand.
---
Keep in mind that waiting in the queue doesn't count towards the 30 minute character screen limit, so you have to hit this constantly changing window of waiting in the queue long enough that you get to the character screen with less than 30 minutes until launch, but short enough that you're not stuck in a queue past launch.
---
this but unironically
---
Mate, the first person to nab the name "Mister" on Bigglesworth will be blessed.
---
&gt; They don't have the luxury of wasting tons of time to even get a group for a dungeon.
---
Then classic may not be suitable for them.  Even if their groups were somehow created instantly they need to be prepared for a dungeon to take a couple of hours.  Changing wow to become more and more casual-friendly is what led to what retail is today.
---
Even more hilarious: What they're doing is *already* against the ToS. Blizzard doesn't even have to make up a reason, they're already breaking it in the "Game Disruption" category.
---
I've never seen this meme before
---
The drop down menu only shows up when you have another version of WoW installed, ie: retail wow.
---
The addons showing on your twitch app right now are the addons for classic.
---
we're coming back to WoW with \~15 friends, most of us don't care while we have two of them acting the opposite of your meme. They refuse to play with so many of their friends (most even IRL) just because they "fuck the horde"
---
I agree OP 👍
---
please don't roll on spirit gear as a warrior when there is a priest/warlock.
---
This is too good, haha.
---
Getting rank 14 on shazarah is going to be the hardest thing ever. Getting rank 14 on a medium pop over server will still be a challenge but no where near as bad as on a full hard-core PvP server
---
IMO, this is one of the easiest things to do compare to the numerous other activities that do require a group, especially at level 60. It does differ in a way since you'll be going back occasionally once you use up your charges, but it's an easy task that you can do during any down time while solo to keep busy for 5 quick runs. 
---
I see it as just another activity, and if you discourage from that then you probably won't play classic for long honestly.
---
You're competing against your own faction on your server so everyone has the same advantage/disadvantage.
---
So yes it's more enjoyable if you don't spend time in queue (though one might argue that queue can allow you to take break and therefore  better) and with less people it's probably easier to organise queue for rank 14 but that's all.
---
So now we're against the new macros too. WTF!? This sub has gone off the rails.
---
Most of this shit is useless and like the others said most people already know the good items to grab from vendors already. You clearly just want attention and karma
---
As you really don’t have any experience of the game, I’d advise that you avoid guides. Discover the world by yourself it’ll feel much more special. Try to keep the guides later on if you feel stuck and don’t know where to go
---
As for the dps you want, maybe ranged for starters?
---
this was valid at the past. now try to find that ninja looter in 1 million player
---
Hello, first time playing wow. I decided to play as a human mage, and i have a few questions 
---
What profession i should choose? 
---
I have chosen to play on a pvp server since people told me it would be a true experience. Can i handle myself in pvp as a mage? 
---
I can play 2-3 hours a day, and maybe 5 or 6 in the weekend. How long would it take for me to reach level 60?
---
Thanks.
---
Damn son.. this is gonna create only more chaos if true..
---
Thing is? In vanilla classes have flavour. Even if the mage is the best on paper, you might like the challenges or playstyles of other classes.
---
I would very much be down for rolling a shaman for the challenge if my friend group didn't already have 2 healers for example.
---
This is what I’m hoping for
---
Yeah, like a rattling drug addict
---
Be part of the solution. Not the problem!
---
Launch Experience :D
---
I always used F for ghost wolf, too!
---
It's incredible. I LOVE Led Zeppelin and I'm rolling on Atiesh so its perfect haha

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cud3s1/how_to_beat_a_rogue/). 
---
As someone once said, "saying 'just don't use it' isn't good enough because it will start to become part of the fabric." What that means is that when it becomes popular or meta enough that more than half the player base uses the mod, it will severly limit your options since your won't be using it or grouping with over half the server.
---
Simply not using it is not good enough when all around will. And you may think that not using won't affect you but it obviously will.
---
&gt; Thanks for the invasion.
---
FTFY
---
Druids clown on mages and rogues 1v1
---
The OG virgin vs Chad meme?
---
It is understandable to take a conservative approach. What it is NOT understandable is to greatly underestimate the player base for "THE" MMORPG that skyrocketed the genre to unbelievable numbers in the 2005-2010.
---
Nobody is blaming Blizzard for the methodology of staggering the realm release.
---
We are blaming them for being blind, and not understanding their player base, and this lack of vision and predictability was what at the base of the decision to start the realm with a STUPIDLY low number.
---
They fucked up the start, leading to massively overpopulated realms. Herod, Shazzrah, Whitemane, Golemagg, Farlina, are having 3-4 times more players than what was intended. The other Full realms are twice the number of players that was intended.
---
Blizzard was not extremely conservative. Blizzard was extremely incompetent in EVALUATING the player base : CLOSED beta at 10k players-sub required. Stress tests - sub required. Name reservation - sub required.
---
I am sorry, but Blizzard was beyond stupid to EVALUATE the Classic players base...WITH THE RETAIL PLAYER BASE !
---
Level every class to 15 and then decide.
---
I hope they'll enjoy their inevitable bans.
---
You forgot one thing you need 3 of the group to summon the other 2 so it's all rather pointless
---
I don't have a problem with add-on nearly as much as people like you misunderstanding simple concepts and then doubling down on stupidity to try to look correct.
---
Why does everyone act there was 45 minute interviews involved in setting up groups in classic?
---
"LF1M, HEALS"
---
"Inv pls"
---
Ohhh, so much conversation.
---
I always just tab-targetted until I saw stacks of sunder...
---
leave them behind, they'll catch up someday.
---
It should be pretty easy to get for hunters on ally side, 2handed fury isn't really a thing because no windfury.
---
Unless your off-tank is a total pvp-mate warrior who's managed to finagle himself in there as arms spec for loot, it really should be hunter prio.
---
I know nothing about that band, but /r/gatekeeping is thataway.
---
This thumbnail is 90% cancer and 10% aids
---
Not really, it opens up the game a lot. In Runescape, money is much, much important than in even Classic WoW. A lot of OSRS players get stuck in a rut of grinding out GP in the most efficient ways possible in order to buy materials to train their skills. To an Ironman, gold is a lot less valuable and a lot of people like that liberation from the player market.
---
As soon as it goes cross fraction they're fucked.
---
I tried right now and I could create a new char Shazzrah just fine, I only got a warning for queues, must be some problem on your mate's part.
---
use macro keyboard. those alre legal.
---
it wont fish for you tho
---
You know, personally I don’t want the LFG addon, but honestly, does it really matter?
---
The people who want to use it will, and the people who don’t want to use it, will still be able to look for groups “The Old Fashioned way”
---
Why does it matter?
---
Whatever you want to believe baby!
---
Druid, shaman, paladin.
---
3 hybrids.
---
My opinion is that druid is the most versatile of the 3 - stealth, speed and decent leveling. But that’s a bit of a biased answer I think
---
You are mistaking Blizzard for Jagex. Blizzard goes all the way.
---
It actually does autogroup. If you turn on autoinvite you can literally afk and come back to a full group.
---
just call it asscandy at that point, why pretend.
---
My interrupts are all bound to wheel-up. :D I love binding all interrupts to the same key, though. As an altoholic I find it very useful.
---
That's a cool story :) Encompasses lots of the stuff we all love about WoW.
---
This add-on won't do cross realm so why not?
---
This story is too detailed to be false
---
because if it becomes extremely popular it becomes the only way to find groups
---
It’s not that difficult to prove..GMs don’t need a chat log to prove collusion.
---
Did it occur to you that a lot of people have spreadsheets just like you? They don't post screenshots of them on reddit in what I assume is an attempt to get people to say "Nice"? It's cool that you made this but the way you went about posting it obviously wasn't the right way.
---
If you're planning on playing classic this is the best time to start playing. Everyone is at the same starting point. The experienced players will level faster than you but that doesn't matter. You will have the sense of wonder that they wont.
---
If you don't think he's true then I have some news for you...
---
Raiding in vanilla was easy mechnically.
---
Imagine needing to look cool and edgy from the very beginning of the game with transmog. &gt;Imagine caring about using shoulder pads as a status symbol. &gt;Sounds like you have an inferiority complex and need to show off how awesome you are because you need that kind of validation.
---
Grow up dude. It's pretty clear you've ran out of decent points when you just devolve to poorly worded insults in place of actual discussion. It's just pathetic to see this kind of response from someone so clearly defeated. 
---
Reply if you must, but you'll be blocked. Enjoy trying to get blizzard to agree that you need transmog in the game because unlike you, they know what it means to the social aspect and community in classic.
---
Thanks, so it's quite a bit of trial and errors to figure out what you can and can't handle and to find out how to deal with stuff you can't handle?
---
You can play both at the same time!
---
doesnt´t matter.
---
Literally nothing? You seem to underestimate what qol changes can have on human behavior.
---
Ohh noooo I won't be able to group with petty people ooohhhh noooo how will i ever survive? Oh man, either I get shunned for rolling on loot I need or I don't roll on loot I need and never get anywhere.
---
&gt;if you don't let me walk all over you, we'll walk all over you!
---
Ahahaha!!!!
---
Just someone having a VERY STRONG opinion about something they know nothing about.  Typical for the internet these days.
---
Keep in mind classic is different. You can have a full blown PvE spec and do fine in PvP. So much more is about the gear you have and your PvP gear is going to come from PvE. You might be better suited to spec that direction and get gear and you still can PvP.
---
As for the class play what you like the most.
---
I can't speak for anyone else, but for me it was just BFA that I hated, though I didn't care for WOD, it was due to content drought. BFA was  the FIRST expansion I preordered, because it was Warcraft, even if the expansion's story wasn't that great, it would still be a good time.
---
Instead, I got a class so broken that once I leveled some alts, I was down to picking the least cumbersome one to use. I got warfronts that were just 20 man instanced dungeons that were very difficult to loose, and another AP grind, but this time there wasn't anything interesting to unlock. Oh, and a PvP gearing system that's so weird I still don't completely understand what Blizzards motivations are/were.
---
I played a Timewalking dungeon last time it was up. In two of the instances, I had a neck piece drop.... but it left me with the impression that Blizzard wasn't even bothered to care about this expansion. So why should I.
---
It's about the experience
---
Oh the irony ♥
---
Having an auto clicker in raids wouldn’t be useful and probably make things harder. You need to be able to move and unless you have certain macros set up you usually can’t cast a different spell while channeling another.
---
Dear u/dngrs,
---
Thank you for you for your feedback on your experience with the WoW Classic Wheel™. We greatly appreciate the time you spent to provide insight how we should improve our deterministic methodology.
---
Your journey spinning the wheel was both informative and topical, and has inspired our team to come up with some exciting ideas for the algorithm.
---
Once again, a big thank you from all of us and we look forward to having you back to spin another day.
---
With warmest regards,

---
spoilers: loud and random screaming
---
Does anyone have the full background picture? It looks amazing!
---
startup idea
---
&gt;Maybe this is worth the trouble for a guild looking to load up on Devilsaur gear and flasks.
---
Of course it's worth the trouble, it's one of the most profitable things you can do in WoW. The mafia guys on private servers were making something like 500 gold/hr.
---
&gt;The only way the prices aren't going to reach a natural equilibrium is if the people farming them restrict supply
---
Yes, that's exactly how it works. If you want a piece of Devilsaur gear (2 piece BIS for Warriors, Rogues, and Hunters), you have to go through the mafia.
---
And sure, they won't get every single spawn. But even the random rogue who happens to get some leather at 3 AM doesn't have any incentive to undercut the mafia by a substantial amount, so the pricing will still be affected.
---
&gt;there is way too much labor involved for this stuff to just end up on rotting unused. 
---
Would you rather sell 10 pieces of armor for 3000 gold or 20 pieces fo armor for 3000 gold?
---
Also, the demand on this stuff is massive. It's BIS for 3 of the most played classes in the game. And when it comes between you and getting into your favorite guild, you'll pay the price.
---
There may or may not be the Horde/Alliance collusion like there was on private servers, but there will absolutely be players vying to control these resources because of the sheer potential for profit.
---
See you at level 17!
---
Do you happen to have those mouseover macros?
---
The biggest problem is that the gear you need is better on a warrior who deals way more dmg and is a better tank 
---
But ret is playable just not as good 
---
The buffs are nice doe
---
Play balance druid for top end game sick deepz

This message occur only on Shazzrah EU
---
That's what these people want though.  1000 people spamming LFG looking for people vs a UI in game that will display the same information.  As much as people want to believe this isnt going to be Vanilla.  Gaming has changed and so have people's lives since Vanilla came out years ago.
---
Then if it becomes popular, isn’t it the better option? If it wasn’t why would it get popular? 
---
Trust me, I get it, the experience of looking for your own group and then walking to a dungeon is nostalgic.
---
But is it efficient?
---
&gt;It originated from a cutscene in a Call of Duty game
---
Read OP lmao
---
Vanilla had the same, calltoarms
---
smite is shit for dps
---
i think for a very short period i remember holy damage as not being able to be resisted which meant you could itemize different than other spellcasters but it still didn't make enough of a difference
---
also i think you needed a ret pally for holy judgement and holy aura in order to even be close to the bottom of the dps
---
Correction. Auto-invite only invites people who whisper 'Invite Please'. It doesn't guarantee 1 tank / 1 healer / 3 dps. You could get 3 healers 1 dps. Auto-invite is disabled by default.
---
Auto grouping would be forming a party with the correct classes which this tool does not do.
---
If you have an emergency I think your raid will understand that. The other 39 people will do fine :)
---
Yeah, I don't agree with this. 
---
I started playing WoW a few months before TBC was launched and I was able to do dungeons and elite quests no issues up until launch of TBC. 
---
Even after TBC launched I had no issues finding groups for quests and dungeons.
---
I've no issue on faction. Alliance is the way to go for me.   
---
But class.... Fudging fidgetspinners it's a tough one.  
---
It's either tank on warrior, heal on paladin/priest, or dps on rogue / mage.
---
mom also said im a unique boi
---
There were tons of zones like that. 
---
Eastern Plaguelands had the path to the Blood Elves eventual starting zone, it also had the Port of Strath never opened to this day.
---
Then there were two zones on the sides of Blackrock Mountain that never opened and were removed from the map in Cata.
---
There was a BG portal in Azshara for Azshara's Crater that never made it into the game. 
---
There was a raid portal in Winterspring in the demon area intended to be a Hyjal raid, assets re-used in TBC but not fully. 
---
Kara was in Vanilla, Atiesh had the ability to open a portal to there. 
---
Caverns of Time existed, and you could get inside but it looked nothing like the TBC version. 
---
There was another Stockades type raid in Stormwind, it's the random fort floating in the water. 
---
Uldum existed in theory, a quest took you there but it didn't open until Cata. 
---
Heck, when the game came out Silithus was completely unfinished and evolved massively during the life of Vanilla. Was amazing to see it change so much.

Don't know if this is just a beta thing, but it shows talents in this clip https://clips.twitch.tv/RudeInquisitiveDragonFreakinStinkin

I think this data shows us more what servers are going to be the most toxic. Those with the highest response rate are more likely to be toxic. Those are the servers with individuals obsessing every waking moment about the game, and willing to take a survey.
---
It obviously is not an indication of population. Several high and medium pop servers have higher response rates then FULL servers. PvE which tends to attract the more chill crowd, as well as RP, they are smoking a bowl and not even worried about stats.
---
Also... judging from response rate... streamer servers and servers with a diversity of individuals like Thalnos are less likely to be flooded with meme kids.

---
I got rank 13 on Garona as alliance, which had the worst alliance /horde disparity of all servers when Xserver BGs opened up. It was a grind and a half, it took three weeks for one person on alliance side to get rank 14. I never went for it since we had a queue, and given the pop problems if you weren’t in the main plow you had no chance on alliance. By the time it was my turn I had a better PvE weapon. My impression from the whole process is that a 50/50 server with a healthy pop on both sides makes the grind infinitely easier though obviously this is based off of memories from 13 years ago.
---
OTOH it was cool running around with Field Marshall since you had to be a moron to hit 13 and not hit 14.
---
Oh no, not $7.50!  Whatever will I do?!
---
Did Call to Arms break vanilla? It basically had the same functionality.
---
Just bear in mind the private servers wont give an exact duplication of classic. But close enough to know if you will like it. And a chance to explore a couple of different classes before picking one for real.
---
What is this? An early *underperforming sales* joke????

I don't have the heart to tell him.

Combo points stack on the target not yourself.  If you kill a target that has combo points on it, you lose those combo points.
---
Create a pickpocket macro with all of your stealth opener abilities.  Automatic free money and lock pick boxes for doing what you would have done anyway.
---
Work on lockpicking.  It’s an incredibly profitable skill that only rogues can do.  Other classes must use a profession to open lockboxes.

Damn, you’re making me want to roll a rogue.

Yes once a day after work I login and just stare at my main thinking "soon... soon".

Heh, nothin personell ION
---
iLVL exists in vanilla however its an arbitrary number.... people would be stupid to use it as a metric... their are classes who are BIS - dungeon blues over MC epics...
---
Actually, as a former shadow priest raider, I noticed that most guilds wanted at least 1 Spriest for their raid. Having some extra group heals from Vampiric Embrace is pretty useful, and spriests weren't slouches in the dps department, either. Only problem with bringing casters like locks and spriests is the limited availability of debuff slots on enemies.
---
For Lordaeron, friend!
---
I'm not the one in denial about a chat parser.
---
Nah, you gotta kiss the ring for them prices.
---
haha, "any kind of vitamin"
---
Exactly. Why are so many classic players insisting on having other people enjoy the game their way and every other way is wrong?
---
To maximize your utility, go tailoring/mining and drop mining for engineering at level 60.
---
For a more casual approach, do tailoring/skinning and vendor skins (or sell on the AH if they're selling well). It's easier to level than mining and it's a good, thoughtless profession.
---
I have to agree classicwow is a fucking nuclear waste pit.
---
It is a long time ago where I have seen so much toxic and hostile behavior.
---
The great part of vanilla was that you could played it as you want and had fun with it.
---
Day 10 Patchnotes!
---
I really can't believe how close we are. I remember watching the announcment trailer from BlizzCon 2017 and I had tears in my eyes. It's been so long but we're almost home!
---
Changelog-
---
* Day 2: Changed "2 Factions Fightin'" to "2 Feudin' sides" | Still trying to find perfection and it's still eluding me. I could live with this but I really hope I find something that fits the best soon! - Maybe I should just change it to something else? Someone suggested "2 Dropped Bindings" which is pretty good and the conflict piece is kinda already covered with day 9 but I dunno, I feel like the Horde/Alliance dichotomy needs to be highlighted. Thoughts? 
---
* Day 7: Changed "7 Dwarven Ghosties" to "7 Raids awaitin'", updated image | Some people thought day 7 was a bit weak and/or juvinile. Thank to: /u/Koulie and /u/ChaosPatriot21 for the brainstorm session
---
* Day 8: Changed "8 Races Raidin'" to "8 Races Lootin'" to avoid repetition with the changes to day 7. Thanks to: /u/Aleriya for the heads up!
---
Added Day 10: The Man, The Myth, The Legend wearing the Tier 2 Shaman set [10 Storms](https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=216/the-ten-storms) Thanks to  /u/LiterallyABlackBear. I reached out to him and he was nice enough to allow me to use his likeness for this meme, so I made sure to get his character looks and guild name as close to perfect as possible.
---

20 fps is good enough for Classic
---
WoW had an lfg tool in early wow and nobody used it.  All it did was socially connect people who wanted to do the same dungeon together.  It won’t be popular but blizzard won’t remove it out of some misguided sense of purism.
---
Good for you, mate.
---
Have fun with classic!
---
Im priest Horde :P
---
&gt; Bullshit. 
---
Prove it.
---
&gt; Supporting garbage makes you garbage. 
---
I told you your point was a straw man argument and you doubled down. What a mad lad.  
---
Also, "Garbage" comment x1.
---
&gt; "unnecessary process". To you maybe, but to people that want to maintain the effort required, nope. 
---
If "maintaining effort" for you means spamming LFG then yeah, sure. I don't even think it qualifies as effort.
---
&gt; The addon is TRASH and leads to very bad things. You should be ashamed of yourself. 
---
Literally not even said anything other than "Addon bad you suck"  
---
Also, "Garbage" comment x2. 
---
&gt; Nice cope. 
---
??? That doesn't even make sense
---
&gt; It's nearly the same thing, both are convenience promoting garbage that lead to the destruction of social interaction. 
---
QoL changes alone did not kill WoW as I said before.  
---
Also, "Garbage" comment x3.
---
&gt; You clearly don't. 
---
ok buddy
---
&gt; Yet most of the classic community does, amazing. 
---
On the contrary, I took a glance at your post history and it seems every time you comment people shut you down, then you call them a zoomer and tell them to stick to retail. It seems to me that the majority of people who actually look into the addon either think it's fine, or just a bit shit but not a dealbreaker.
---
Thank you so much! amazing videos, subsribed for future content :)
---
&gt;I've always explained it this way: intentional time sink.
---
Yup. It's just lazy quest design and nothing more.
---
I'm actually supposed to buy that only 20% on the murlocs on beaches of Southshore actually have a fucking head?!
---
If you design a quest where the item is a lower drop chance, it needs to be believable that not every mob would have one. So instead of a body part that every single one needs to have to even be alive, change it to something like Enchanted Tribal Beads, which not every murloc would have.
---
&gt; his doesn't automate any processes
---
It has auto-invite.  The next version could easily add in item-level automatic checks and god knows what other decision-making abilities, all with zero social interaction.  We've already been down this road and know where it leads.
---
You really dont understand the scale of these mafia groups... constant 40+ player groups per guild scouting ungoro.  You cant do shit to them no matter how hard you try.
---
No point getting mad about it before Blizzard have even made a statement.
---
thank you kind huntard.
---
Let's just ignore ret paladins or warriors who want go 2h fury on ally as well. Hunters are 2nd priority behind those two.
---
i have both versions. no button tho
---
Murder!
---
I thought they were waiting for a gathering node to respawn.
---
&gt;uses it
---
he was testing it to see exactly what it did you numbskull
---
Thanks, I needed more spam to report.
---
&gt; I don't even think it qualifies as effort.
---
Then don't use the LFG addon, oh wait.
---
of the \~5 years spent on VG i never heard of these addons even once
---
This addon doesn't teleport you to dungeons, that's against the spirit of the game, sheesh it's not a difficult thing to discern.
---
I like the Nostromo n52, Razer makes a new variant.
---
Damn geomancers in jasperlode...
---
Vanilla is much easier compared to retail and everyone that states otherwise is delusional. A single 5 man retail dungeon has more mechanics than all of Molten Core combined. There's only a handful of bosses that require some skill and little more than a single simple job for each role. Even after classes have been gutted and dumbed down they're still much more challenging and engaging in retail. 
---
People aren't playing Classic for its difficulty.
---
&gt; Raid and PVP specs are different
---
I wouldn't really count this one. You can easily raid with a Mage in a PvP spec for a while. Warlock, ideally, also has a different spec if we're talking completely optimal PvE DPS besides a singular SM/Ruin specced lock.
---
Queue times are for world PVP
---
If you don't have an invitation, that's called an invasion
---
TBC!
---
I \*just\* missed Ret and landed on Prot, but same here. It's hard to not be convinced by the naysaying, but I'm absolutely going to play a Ret Paladin.
---
Care to detail my lapse of judgement?
---
The headless murlocs of Southshore is the thing that immediately comes to mind for me.
---
Smart enough to not engage some tween on reddit who is so upset about an addon in a game he never even played before that he's brigading the entire site on haha. Good luck on your exams, bud, don't play the game too much you have your whole future ahead of you.
---
Its a big deal when every server has 50k queue and people have paid yet cannot play at all.
---
I really don't like that addon and I do hope Blizzard does something about it.. but man get off your high horse.
---
I leveled as fire in BC and it was awful, mostly because I didn't understand leashing and splitting packs effectively, but still... With fire, there's a lot less room for error. With frost, your survival rate is assured via being able to rarely take damage.
---
Thats actually great. Sure its a different angle but its healthy to have that independent time. Kudos.
---
That seems like a bad choice cause you could end up rolling Alliance...
---
It's a fuckin name it doesn't feel like anything
---
I read that line and went, *"Oh no..."*
---
Ahh, interesting!
---
Just need way more servers to spread out the trash.
---
Do you already have a character on Shazzrah though?
---
i can already picture this, yes...yeeees
---
If you're taking 20 days played to hit 60 on any class then that is simply an awful judge on how faat characters level in terms of relative speed. You could have played any class after that and thought it was better simply because you improved as a power-leveler.
---
Suck it up, my friend! A cough/cold wouldn't have taken you down back in the day! (Maybe... I don't know you...) :)
---
Dear high iq person,

---
Does rank 3 blizzard not get overwritten by come of cold I'm classic? Ie is it better to just get 2 into improved blizzard for aoe farmimg?
---
I believe so, I can't find anything that states differently. They changed how Rosewine dropped, but it appears to have been there from release.
---
All we really know is today’s “medium” is about the same as “full” was in 2006.
---
Thanks! Apologies for being armored up....it's reddit
---
Why do you keep changing day 2? It goes from good, to bad, back to good, back to bad. Today ain't great for day 2.
---
Ahaha... Yeah man, you got some hate for those comments! Damn, sorry about that... but you're not going crazy.  You are however many many months out of the loop :)
---
It's damaging to the community, which in turn damages the game.
---
But did you already have a character there? IIRC, "locked" means that only accounts with already existing characters in that server can create new ones.
---
The wow classic devs who agree it will affect the community enough to consider their options of dealing with the problem.
---
Did you guys even watch the clip in the tweet? It was a minute long -\_-
---
So, you’re saying he needed it worse than you???? 
---
How does that prove any point worth mentioning?
---
No sorry. That was on private server and don't have those macros saved anymore. They wouldn't work anyways though on classic since it's a different client.
---
 THis is however the macro for enemy mouseover with a spell in upcoming classic:
---
/cast \[@mouseover, harm,nodead, exists\]\[\] spellname
---
 Don't have time right know to google it but should be easy to convert for marking.
---
Yeah, it's a bit weird. I see people complain about LFG and insta-kicking bad players and like...I just don't see it happen. I run a lot of dungeons - they're my favorite thing to do in WoW, Classic or Retail. I'd say that someone gets kicked maybe one out of every 20 runs I do. 
---
I'm generally not worried about the social consequences of having to find replacements because the vast majority of the time, once we've got a group together, it's not hard to finish the dungeon.
---
I said that you can think maintaining effort means spamming LFG, but that I don't think spamming LFG even qualifies as effort.
---
I feel like warriors will be the new hunters. They roll on most weapons and also on all sorts of gear that is not even plate.
---
That's stupid, if there is a better way to group I'm all in. You guys must be a bunch of masochists lol.
---
I will still be playing bfa cuz of arena nothing else.
---
I mean if you just assume he will be shit we can also assume the tank will only hold aggro on 1 mob, dpsers wont focus 1 target, and healer will only know how to heal 1 target.
---
They're neither as good or bad as their detractors &amp; defenders would want you to believe. You just need to surround yourself with the right people.
---
It's easier to just use trade chat. If you want lfg go to retail. It's the prime reason I want classic
---
Yep, thats me. Completely single forever because i look for a s/o with the same interests i have.
---
Everyone knows girls arent on the internet!
---
If it's showing v8.2.0, then the addon works for both retail and classic
---
A full Vanilla realm was 12-13k players. Biggest Vanilla ones had 28k players.
---
What you are talking about is CCU. Which will be roughly 3k per layer, because we start with layering.
---
It is confusing, I know.
---
Today, a Low realm is 12-13k. A Medium is 24k+. Highs at 35k+ and Fulls at 50k+. All layered, with Highs having long queues and Fulls having severe queues.
---
I can't believe we are just 3 days away or so....Ever since Blizzcon 2018 I could not contain my hype for this. It's been a long few months, it's amazing we are finally here.
---
I never in my entire life wanted for a weekend to go faster than now.
---
I always thought that the dungeon finder would be ok if it wasn't cross realm.
---
My biggest fear with Classic WoW right now is when I'm around level 40-50, trying to find groups, only to find out that the majority of players on that realm don't want to/can't speak English. I have no idea which PVP realm to join :(.
---
I think something like " storms a callin' " or " storms a brewin' " sounds a bit cleaner. 
---
Also, for #2, I think "Feuding" instead of "Feudin' " is better as -ing is a more distinct syllable than in'
---

---
Top guild Vanilla play. No click healing, no bindings and very bad decision making in regards to which heal to use.
---
A lot of the best trinkets low level. Your right.
---
Also a lot of items are pretty amazing in some instances but are low level. 
---
ilvl is too arbitrary. Anyone who has ever earned full tier gear... how often did you ever actually wear the full set in vanilla outside of RP purposes really? Everyone mixed when min-maxing.
---
Person Of Colour?
---
Blizzard can't even mitigate against spammers to keep persistant skeletons. I doubt they will spend resources trying to mitigate this, as it would take money from Activision investors pockets.
---
You won’t regret it.
---
Power infusion should not be left out if you only need 1 point. I personally play a PI priest but I do not dps with it, mainly I do not like going full holy and I pvp and pve with the same build.
---
Absolutely NOT TRUE. This tool spams the Trade/General/LFG channel. It doesn't have a special channel for LFG spam. It also doesn't auto-group. It can auto-invite if you enable it, but there is no guarantee to what the party formation will be. Most people will disable auto-invite (it's also disabled by default).
---
You will group up with players who use this tool and not even notice.
---
Then don't use LFG addons if spamming chat doesn't require effort.  Oh wait.
---
Well that's the devteam position on addons as well, and I can't agree more with that.
---
As I said in my post I don't mind if people use addons as long as they don't significantly modify the game for everybody. LFG tools is probably the worst thing classic can get.
---
I find it very funny that people want classic so badly but will play it with 20-30 addons straightup downgraded right from retail version. Very "classic".
---
None of them are hard that you wouldnt take certain dps class. I mean people actually think classic dungeons are hard? they are just LONG and slow
---
It´s allready on Medium :)
---
a TRUE hunter weapon!!!!
---
You can't. By what does it matter? The weapon glow won't make or break the outfit, will it?
---
Crusader is a bright white glow.
---
after reading all those posts I think Iam going to be the only gnome in the gnome starting zone
---
Interested to see someone else that has never had a character on Shazzrah try this.
---
1. Yes, but for healing or dps ?
---
2. Not respectable, but at least you can improved your DPS with a Palret mate (+10% holy damage aura &amp; seal of crusader on the mob).  
---
3. Easily, Disci-heal (to get Spirit buff).  
---
ps: go get the point 31 in Disci, you will have to put it on the top dps Mage.
---
Level scaling BGs were so awful. It makes the level feel so artificial and not earned.
---
Even back in classic, the only way a player got a reputation like that was if they were severely toxic. I remember several posts on the realm forums about "player x Ninja loots" and usually the top replies were all "who cares/you're fault". Also, if you're good at your class or an in demand role feel free to be toxic, you'll still get a group.
---
i think it's light blue. but nobody ever uses striking, because it's quite bad.
---
Launch is at 6am so ... possibly?
---
If this became popular it could ruin the core experience of finding and sticking in a group. You are more likely to get kicked or not find a group at all depending on your class, gear, talents, etc. 
---
If a majority of the population of the game starts using this, it would essentially force anyone who wants to find a group to get the addon. Now I don't know if a majority of the population would WANT to use this addon, but the necessity may spread like wildfire depending on how things go.
---
It undercuts one of the main reasons why people are interested in classic; a lack of convenience. Things are more grueling at times, because that makes the end goal that much sweeter. Finding a group for something requires labor, and you're more inclined to stay instead of scrapping the group. This addon promotes quitters. 
---
It just doesn't feel right I guess
---
She looks like she sings From First to Last and dances to Skrillex
---
that's possible if you are a zombie
---
We got second screens now
---
I feel like the addon will only be used by the tourist honestly.  Once hype dies down and stresmers move on the addon will die out.
---
Hi, /u/Ceesil

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cudbmz/is_an_add_on_that_changes_your_appearance_to_the/).

Dude Discord logs are public, can be accessed by nearly anyone.
---
I hope their isn't any agreement to trade between alliance and horde. We should get to have some awesome battles competing for resources.
---
Screenshots are evidence
---
Literally wastes your own time just as much as theirs, until honor tracking
---
 I'll probably use Classic Codex since I heard so many good things about it.
---
Soda is the essence of a cancerous streamer. There's quite a few I like, but he's an ass.
---
I'm playing vanilla for the first time (started in CATA, so missed out on all the good stuff) and rolling mage, but I'm stuck between gnome and human. I set my heart on human because aesthetically they are more pleasing to me, but my brain tells me Gnomes are better suited for the class.
---
Will I be losing out a lot if I roll human? How greatly will this effect my performance in raids/pvp? I'm not trying to top charts, but if it's a severe handicap than I would probably roll gnome.
---
Appreciate any advice.
---
It will for me. I’ll never play BFA again.
---
The how bout Lilpeeepee?  Stupid names are still stupid.
---
I personally got a Tauren named Thex (Hah like I am stupid enough to tell you all my characters actual names!)
---
I think yes its part of classic but man what a useful tool dungeon finder was. I still think even in a classic game tools such as dungeon finder would be a great addition. It will be rough for DPS to find groups for specific dungeons. I also think it was nice to meet folks from across multiple servers. I met some folks during a dungeon from a different server, we had such a great time I ended up transferring a character over there to keep playing with them. Its just little things like that I suppose.
---
how much does spirit matter for mana regen? i would prefer going human mage but does the 5% spirit passive help at all? i heard evocation is based of spirit and then there is the 15% mana regen during combat talent so will this add up or are we talking like max 1 more mana per tick than gnomes making it entirely pointless ?
---
Right, and the long term accumulation and leniency towards these tools surely won't negatively affect the game in any way!
---
Yeah, but atleast that mob will die
---
Only need tailoring for the extra 2% crit.
---
And if the ClassicLFG isn't banned, you can still do that as well as check ClassicLFG *at the same time*.
---
What are you even going on about?
---
There is a difference between something you download from a 3rd party site, install it to the game, has its own UI and add-on specific features and a macro
---
I get that people are saying this isn't game breaking.
---
It does, however, take away some social interaction which sounds bad to me. The part of it having its own LFG channel is also a negative. This will divide the players more, as thoes who doesn't have the addon will maybe miss some possible group invites. 
---
You could end up in a group with people who you've never exchanged a single word, which is removing a lot of social interaction.
---
On a second note. Everyone is fleeing from retail because of (more powerful) tools like LFG and LFR, yet when something that does exactly that except the teleport to dungoen part, they're all for it. 
---
People want the quailty of life improvements to be gone and have a harder game, then someone makes a huge quality of life addon and you're all in favor?
---
What exactly is it that you/we want?..  
---
Also, this is more a question as I don't play retail, can the addon also tell the spec of the player in Classic?
---
Bannable offence.
---
Holy shit I also want a switchblade sword
---
It saddens me so much when I randomly think about his videos and channel...used to like his content so much. It's a big loss for the world of warcraft community. 
---
I hope the light guides your way, warrior of the light!
---
Shit dota should be right there
---
If by "play your character" you mean click 1 move over and over
---
Yeah well I think it's obvious that the Classic servers are going to be full of whiney little shits, just like in the good ole days. :)
---
get two alt accounts with 10 chars each, let them stand at the most used dungeons, then you can invite one member at a time and summon the entire party. 
---
Easy 5g earned!
---
Oh fuck. How did I forget you have to LEARN WEAPON SKILLS?!
---
Running to the dungeon keeps the feeling that you're a part of a living world. If everyone is sitting in their capital city queuing up for stuff, then the world as a whole is dead. Being able to summon gives flavor to warlocks, and makes them special and desired. Also, for a lot of classic dungeons there was an open world dungeon of sorts before the instance that had elites. So you'd have to make your way through that before even stepping foot in the instanced dungeon.
---
If this is true then i feel awkward about lashing out. Watched a couple of minutes of that link and kinda got the idea that he was flexing about this virgin addon. Awkward.
---
the word coalition makes me cringe now
---
&gt;  busy being better-than-thou #nochanges!!!! are now RACING to be first and loudest to beg for changes.

Proof plz
---
I awoke to a tauren druid and he dais "Hey, you, you're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right?"
---
Hah, that's kind of funny. One of our friends refuses to play with us because he hates Alliance. I can't wrap my mind around not wanting to play with your friends because they play a different faction but.. whatever works for them I guess :(

“Corrupted Crematory”??

Fuck all that.
---
Pass = I don't want it.
---
Greed = I have no use for it, but I want to sell or d/e it.
---
Need = I can wear this (or will be able to wear it in a few levels) and it would be an upgrade compared to what I currently have
---
The "hunter weapon" meme is just a meme. No one actually expects you to pass because someone can "need it more".
---
If you are in a guild then your loot system will handle it.
---
all this gets rid of is "lfm wc" "inv" 'shift click'
---
so much interaction
---
or do you think that if you invite people with this program that they will somehow be crossrealm, or that it will disable chat?
---
No you didnt. Stick with retail.
---
Inspect didnt exist yet lmao.
---
Similar to Call to Arms in vanilla? Addons have always existed in this game. We're now mad that all addons exist?
---
It's all about being more hardcore than everyone else on your server. No ifs no buts.
---
See that? See now, that's just the wrong way to look at it. 'Cause vanilla had his time, and tbc put an end to that. Then legion had his time, short as it was, and bfa put an end to that. And now, muthaf****, it's OUR time. Mines and yours. But instead of just shuttin' up and kickin' in, you gonna stand there cryin' that "back in the day" sh*t.
---
 There ain't no "back in the day," *****! Ain't no nostalgia to this sh*t here! There's just the street, and the game, and what happen here today.
---
nice dude
---
you got talent
---
Mate I think greasers have been around for much longer than 2004 lol
---
Basically first and 3rd boss requires 10 mages to make it easy with all the decursing.  And 3 hunters + with tranq shot for 2nd boss.  Easy.
---
Wow.... how has this not been made in the past 15 years? This is absolute Gold.
---
So not necessarily related to most powerful or gear available but I've always been fond of druids at 39 since they have travel form and no one has mounts yet. Properly pocketed its so so annoying to play against....especially if they are resto.
---
You click enter world, wait for the 9999 people ahead of you to get into the world, then you load in...

i think the crown goes to OP
---
Guys.  First of all no add on will be able to teleport to a dungeon or allow you to group cross realm.  So lfg add on won’t do what it does in modern wow.  Also early wow had an lfg function, it just wasn’t very popular.  All it did was connect people socially.  So everybody complaining about lfg add on should just settle down.
---
Yeah i think it’s the best at that bracket. You get siphon life, curse of exhaustion for kiting and your other dots (mainly corruption and CoA with amplify curse) do tons of damage. Additionally your drain life benefits a lot from spell power, you have many useful pets and health stones. Quite often people engage and if you are able to survive long enough you see your dots kill them quite quickly
---
Ah yes, I did use Clique at one point. I never set it up for a healer though, only for utility spells on my tank or dps classes. It looks very nice as well.
---
Merci
---
Why is mage so much better than lock in your opinion
---
No one will die before or during launch. Death will play as well. I heard it rolls undead rogue.
---
"Weird ass dude" 
---
That's John Travolta in Grease.
---
Here's an example; BiS feral dps helm throughout the entirety of classic expansion is a level 40 blue helm :D.
---
i honestly can’t be bothered to get the ilvl for LFR even
---
No worries :D You did a nice job with the video and I think some will really benefit or take a good hard look at their priorities :)
---
An al
---
Yes, let's ignore the ret paladins.
---
As for 2h fury, that sounds like a scam to get pvp weapons, to me. But I wouldn't know anything about that, haven't played ally at max lvl before. Is it any good? Slam spec sounds bad.
---
That was my whole point simple jack, do you like apples and milk?
---
lol, its been a hard choice!  We have been horde for 15 years, its... time to shake it up.
---
I was gonna go herb/arch for professions. Mainly because I think I can make money off it. Is that a bad idea when rolling a mage?
---
Aww.. is it really that bad?
---
🦀🦀🦀Lynx Titan keeps ganking me🦀🦀🦀
---
&gt; Oh ya I know I'm just saying the mind numbing LFM spam in trade is the foundation of the group building process though. 
---
No offense, man, but this is a *horrible* take.
---
Omg imagine waiting for classic the  u die the day before and you never get to play DDD:
---
Don't min/max your dreams unless min/maxing is your dream. Play what appeals to you.
---
Isn't that anything Asmongold related?
---
 Lok'tar Ogar!
---
For 5 mans, you can have the target of target on the raid frames so you can immediately target what the tank is hitting.
---
The difference between LFG addons and chat is basically the number of times you need to post something.
---
LFG you post once. Chat you post every minute or so.
---
You can put the same information and requirements in both. It's the people posting that set these, not the addon.
---
The difference to vanilla is not addons. Not at the core. The difference is that 15 years have passed. The landscape is different now. However many times you spam a hashtag outside of twitter, there are no changes that you can make to this situation.
---
Nah that is not solving the problem though. That's a cowards way out.  Blizz literally said they would prevent things like this during a conference talk and we will hold them to it.
---
Blizz are saying that the most populated realm from vanilla would now be low, but that doesn't mean the reverse is true.
---
Low is their current bracket for 0 to a "medium" number of players. If a realm has 5 characters on it, it would still be "low" and not bigger than any server from 2006.
---
sometimes
---
I can’t decide either.  Priest hunter or rogue.
---
His videos fascinated, and continue to fascinate me. I rewatch them all the time - it is so rare I find something that is so up my alley in terms of content. I binged almost all of them the second I found them. I was heartbroken to hear about his illness and ultimately his passing. 
---
I spent a solid 50% of my time in vanilla trying to explore places you're not supposed to go (behind Ahn'Qiraj, Caverns of Time, Gilneas, etc.). I thought that the time of mysteries was over by WotLK, but his videos showed me otherwise. I will always treasure the content he put out. RIP.
---
He's hideous! 
---
I love it
---
This is great for me as a healer. I get free notifications about groups :D Sometimes I accept lower groups just to help people out
---
"I don't even want to win this battleground..."
---
discord drama!!! I LOVE DISCORD.
---
classic doesn't need discord servers omg
---
It will be, it's best in slot still
---
I used to make male troll characters all the time but hate how male trolls have to stretch every 0.00005 seconds. I’m rolling a troll priest as one of my Horde alts and considering rolling female troll instead
---
Can't even get myself to grind the last couple of rep to unlock flying in BfA...I don't want to play the island simulator anymore. I found peace, I'm not angry anymore...I'm just waiting to kill some Ally in Classic. See you all on the other side.
---
So what is a good fight to account DPS for you? There’s not a single fight you see as a good example, please come up with a good example instead of excuses.
---
You seem to have an aversion to Hunters, is that a trauma?
---
I tell you I’ll be top DPS, I don’t need another disbeliever to tell me I won’t, stop shitting on other people choices, roll your mage/rogue/warrior and be happy with it.
---
As disc/holy you have to choose between that and power infusion
---
Nice mental gymnastics there, huntard. :)
---
I play a priest, if you are needing on loot that I need I don't know what to tell you, that's even worse lol. Anyway I have said my piece, you don't get my point and you talk like a selfish prick so you can stop responding to me now.
---
Haha... fuck, now you did it to me too...
---
"not pvping" clearly isn't bannable.  However it went way beyond that shit on pservers, people would mindcontrol and heal mafia members, or mind control them so they couldnt be killed by someone on the same faction etc.  They'd also do things like constantly cast sheep on the devilsaur you were trying to kill to heal it (this cant happen on classic luckily since u cant sheep things that are tagged by someone else).
---
Realistically you can't do anything about people "not killing X guild on oposite faction" however that kinda thing isn't usually enough to get full control of devilsaur, especially with layering.  If they end up doing things like the MC tricks or even if it just becomes extremely obvious they are colluding by actions or inactions - blizz will ban them.
---
Draw and post.
---
My first video game was Wolfenstein 3D as it was released so nah. Also 3 years on reddit. But that here is a fucking disgrace.
---
hunters are the most oppressed gamer
---
Never saw it recommended on my server.
---
Sure it sucks to waste time compared to modern wow but anyone paying attention to modern mmos knows that boiling away time wasters also boils away server ties. People want that community back and it wont exist without wasting a little time on talking to other people.
---
mmmm.  
---
Well, if that is the case , im fully expecting it to be available within the first 2 weeks, after release....
---
Good.  That’s what business do.  Just because you’re playing a game doesn’t really mean they are.
---
Retuning them for a "classic plus"? Go wild I guess. I don't see them ever doing "classic plus" so I have no real take on it either way.
---
I don't really want to play on a west coast server as most friends are EST but.... hard to argue a name like Biggelsworth.  That's pretty great.
---
I’m hoping they relaunch TBC, WOTLK, and Cata until the money dries up. Won’t cost them much to maintain live servers while milking content for a second go around.
---
Using your days off work for \*questing\* isn't exactly the most exciting prospect to some.
---
It's a fun part of the game, and it does play a major role, but you can imagine some people have other goals.
---
I didn't want to play classic. I am a visual and graphical person. The graphics I remember weren't that good. When I done the name reservation I turned all my graphics up to full. I am amazed how good they look compared to the memory I have of them. I log in now and again just to look at how good my character looks now compared to how they did.
---
Not directly comparable.
---
Love his nose, it's like an upvote button.
---
What's a grizzly
---
I am not sure if they have been ported, but I think I remember using an addon called omens threat meter and recount as the dmg meter during Vanilla.
---
queue
---
It’s sm. This is not a hard dungeon. The biggest factor is that they were 12 levels behind.
---
Thanks, this is a helpful comparison!
---
There's a shit ton of graphical upgrades in Classic compared to vanilla. If you want vanilla graphics, you can lower your settings in the video options.
---
&gt;presses fear and waits to death coil
---
The difficulty just really gets to me ;)
---
They’re not “useless,” but they’re not preferred.  If you have a good attitude you’ll be able to get into a group or even a raid as a ret pally.
---
Yea and i am hyped for that! I just don't see the need to complain
---
Plot twist, there both men, and they set their home at the same inn
---
Velen was just made up for the expansion. It's great that they're expanding lore, but it's obnoxious that they do it by retconning existing lore. They could have added WC3 Draenei to the Alliance instead of spaceship retconned Draenei
---
I cannot open the raw data :( after long time I just get a black screen. Can someone please tell me the alliance/Horde ratio on Hydraxian Waterlords RP server? Thanks
---
They said 4-6 hour queues fit full. Or more
---
Personally I'll be playing with my feet whilst doing a handstand

Thank god. I haven't gotten to read the full ama yet. Its on the list for the weekend.
---
I log in and whisper “Soon...soon..”.
---
I am somewhat ashamed that my answer to this is "Yes".
---
Yeah I agree, the amount of people who are going to resub like an hour before is going to be insane
---
Ok but do you guys even know the years that a boomer falls under... clearly seems not.
---
I honestly like a group finder tool.  
---
NOT the automated LFG that randomly throws you into a group with several different people and teleports you to a dungeon.
---
I am speaking about the normal, simple GUI that you have for forming or finding groups for dungeons, raids, pvp, custom etc.  That still requires you to manually invite people.
---
I mean... what is the difference between standing in Ironforge and spam trade chat that you are making a group for deadmines,  and having a GUI that lets you put a note down for forming a group with a list of people that want to sign up for it that you can manually invite? It is essentially the same thing, the GUI is just less messy.
---
It's possible, this one is solid and Esrever has put in a lot of time/effort into it. He's also almost always around to for bug fixes/help , check it out.

---
ya this is what nightmares were made of in 2006 for sure
---
No they are not allowed because blizzard wants you to play the game yourself, no matter how boring the task is.
---
Why not?
---
Umm no. Druid at 19 doesn't have cat form.
---
Another thing to consider, if you have G-Sync enabled monitor, it can cause issues when exceeding max frame rates, and as such, disable G-Sync.
---
Limit your frames to 59 for 60hz and 143 for 144hz using the slider.  
---
Since the game will likely cap these settings it also allows the GPU to run cooler and extend it's life as it's not processing frames you can't even use anyways.
---
I personally usually use T for interrupts...except for conterspell, for some reason.
---
Please do! I will keep an eye out for it.
---
🦀 Show player polls 🦀

For the Horde!
---
Do you want a dead game? This addon will make a dead game.
---
Aside from the cross faction issues, the majority of what is posted is fully legit.  It isn't in the spirit of Classic WoW and only time will tell if they have the numbers for it.  I don't know if Blizzard would come down on a group for manipulating the price of items when they didn't care during the old days.  If Blizzard lets players kite world bosses to major cities, they aren't going to step in if a guild is able to create a monopoly of specific resources.  In game actions using in game resources is fully inside the TOS and has zero chance of being banned.
---
Yes. Small. No
---
I've been warning friends not to get too invested in our server/guild of choice atm.  At the very least, we should have a backup realm.  If we can roll on that backup realm on day 1, while our original realm is stuck in queues for days/weeks, the 'backup' will quickly become our home.
---
And 3 months from now, it will have ended up not mattering one bit.
---
80kg is thin to you at 6'1"?
---
Well, that makes me feel better about my weight. Thanks! :)
---
The dungeon level ones are entirely appropriate, at least. And if you team up with a group you can do the 7+ level ones. It's probably worth it to do them early, at least for priests.
---
When you go to the wow launcher you will see an option above the play button that you can toggle to wow classic
---
&gt; but I'm not sure if it was a TBC or Classic talent so youd have to double check.
---
I answered that from above, you're welcome.
---
They're still shitting their pants about the water graphics.
---
As much as I'd like to, I can't do that for various reasons\^\^ But you can try to make one yourself. I used this as a base [https://warcraft-games.3dn.ru/Wow/fullmap.jpg](https://warcraft-games.3dn.ru/Wow/fullmap.jpg) . It probably isn't even that much work if you're good withz photoshop, which I ain't...\^\^
---
Same as current LFG which im fine with, the only time where auto invite would be an advantage would be for public events for pvp etc in the world.
---
I don't know how feasible it is to add all rest to be like world quest group finder which i am 100% against as well. I don't like playing the game of this isn't that bad but what next is, currently i have no issue with the addon but if the functionality changes then i would also change my opinion.
---
I think Blizzard is also probably keeping a close eye on the situation as well, if they step in and block the addon all good but i still stand by my original position of "don't worry about how others play the game"
---
Super small. Like roughly 3 gigs.
---
Dl through the bnet launcher
---
Oh my god you included Kralnor's staff post.
---
Pick a Server, login and have fun.
---
Totally concur! How do I join this army?
---
And that’s because warrior leveling is trash tier without the most relevant weapon. I can assure you, if the dps of a caster staff is higher than their current 2 hander, they are gonna roll need on it unless nice person
---
Blizzard can ban anyone for no reason. It is their product and you are not entitled to have it. You can sue for a refund but that will cost more than the refund, so..
---
&gt; But this is highly inefficient, and in some cases won't actually get you a party.
---
This is one of the things I really remember about my time back in Classic. Spamming my LFG/LFM Macro in IF, copy pasting my lines to ask random priests/warriors if they want to run &lt;dungeon&gt;. 
---
And how many hours I spent just waiting. Who the fuck prefers this experience over a simply listing tool that lets you group up in a fraction of the time?
---
Blizzard should ban all these fucking retards. This isn't a private server, so get the fuck out of here with that bullshit.
---
How do they stop it though? They would literally have to break so many addons to do so that are useful and were also in Vanilla WoW.
---
yes through blizzard app, 3gb i think
---
People really aren't grasping this at all. You've made some great points. All this knowledge that we have now 15 years later means it will never be the same as when it was originally released. Threads like these are so cancer, they just want you to play the game their way.
---
Ranking is about competing versus your own faction.
---
Nice. 
---
Also fuck the horde 
---
For the alliance!
---
You can literally use a white melee weapon as a Hunter, all you do is melee with it. If you stole a melee weapon upgrade from a warrior/rogue you're worse than a huntard.
---
Should we give 2004 it's game back too?
---
Yeah. He's pretty fucking weird.
---
For Alliance, says so in the title.
---
 Because babbies don’t like it

Bad bear, or a group that doesn't understand threat. It's possible an unpopular spec is played by a bad player, or with bad players.

still thats only 2 hours a day for a month to get 60. thats pretty casual, no?
---
Dungeon finder addon for classic would destroy everything vanilla was about, and everything they've worked hard for to bring us would crash and burn..

Im german and just realized my poor translation. Ofc i mean set my alarm at 5 and wake up right after.

What changed?

The toxic guys were a minority and weren't harrasing others in fucking pitchfork style

Yea I’m not too worried. If they’re taking this long in WC that just means I’ll have a month or two to work on professions and gold before they even hit cap lol

Not after i set my alarm :^)

It's from Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, in the campaign this scene is shown as you attending the funeral. So the game commands the user to press F to "pay respect". Well looks like World of Warcraft BFA will rest in peace soon.
---
Garrosh did nothing wrong
---
*Expelled*
---
I predict:
---
"The spirit of Vanilla WoW is ruined because people leveled in a way that wasn't known or popular when the game was released. We should count "world first" 60 to someone who leveled by themselves, not the mages who farmed dungeons and cheated their way to 60. I can't believe how many addons I saw on their screen also, that isn't the way I remember it"
---
*embarrassingly raises hand*
---
Yeah by definition it's not accurate, I (and I think many others) usually just use it as a default insult to some weirdos
---
Wait for DM:N  - Two handed sword. [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18520/barbarous-blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18520/barbarous-blade) \- its good even for PvP - huge melee strikes.
---
I never rolled against melees if dalrends dropped. Drop is so rare and its a minor hunter for hunter.... Played Hunter up to Naxx myself. 
---
I was wearing that sworg up to ZG. Where I´ve dropped Sword+dagger from hakkar after some runs.
---
No. You see. I a hugger drink and drive dad whey you’re limp in akkicedent
---
Great thanks!
---
ya most of what the addon claims simply isn't possible. and it is DEFINITELY impossible to keep people they don't like from using it. Addons are open source. Anything they add that would restrict access can simply be removed by someone else and re-uploaded. The entire post is horseshit.
---
10 player premades! With wsg in the background.
---
Well, I’m planning on playing solo for most of the leveling anyway.
---
You're repeating yourself. 
---
I already stated why that first point is false (It might have been changed since you tested it?)
---
I also already stated why comparing it to addons in the vanilla era is problematic, unless you have some sort of proof that a certain percentage of players used the addons you're talking about.
---
This will be my final comment, since we simply seem to disagree and you're downvoting my every comment without taking in the information.
---
It's not bannable, because it's not mentioned in the ToS. It was in vanilla, but it was taken out at some point, I think in wrath.
---
Also good for if the mob is running and you don’t want to waste mana for the last 3% hp.
---
Still need it to learn the skills. After that, you can teach it to any wolf and it will do just as well.
---
He is a mage and conjured it so he can share it with everyone else
---
May your blades never dull, bitch!
---
Can confirm, didn’t know this was a thing until now. 100% plan on downloading it.
---
Now thats another tricky question lol. Me n my buddy reserved names on 3 America PVP servers (est) but dont really have a preference as long as its America and PVP. I think we are going to try to just make a launch-day decision to attempt to avoid queues. Stalagg was our target but looks like thats gotten awfully popular, so again, we'll have to just wait and see in a couple days.
---
Where are you planning on playing?
---
imagine gatekeeping a 15 year old game
---
I think this checks out pretty well
---
Cross faction collusion, bannable.
---
ZUG ZUG
---
these addons existed for vanilla wow too. not sure why its bad now all of a sudden. this post sounds like a bunch of misinformed agree with the masses type of crowd. people think its retail lfg, when its just a chat parser that makes a list of people that are lfg from the lfg global/trade chat. that is all
---
What’s the plan to kill a 1300 hp bear with enough mana to keep rolling hots with bonus healing and shifting any slows?
---
Hollywood closet boy, he's alright but a big weirdo.
---
Don’t be sorry, feel happy about the great things you were able to do in the stress test. Also: the Witcher 3 is an awesome game, once the classic hype dies down a bit for you, you will be able to play it again with renewed enthusiasm
---
[https://youtu.be/hUc70zMFAKI?t=254](https://youtu.be/hUc70zMFAKI?t=254)
---
the main point i want to get across is the fact that feral dps is a niche position to be in as a raider, and you won't always be doing damage for the entire run; i'm like 99% sure this guild would still make an exceptional feral druid like this guy decurse on chromaggus. just because this one feral druid can shine on 45 second fights, doesn't mean that your average feral druid can pull weight on ragnaros in pre-bis gear
---
V is obviously kick!
---
I'm hoping to do primarily Guild runs but I'm definitely downloading this add on now that I know about it.
---
Why the retail LFG tools are bad? 
---
Philosophically it's because humans are very very simple hairless monkeys.
---
We tell stories and make excuses and argue about the narrative, but in the end actions (en masse) are extremely predictable and entirely driven by perceived consequences.
---
-
---
Concretely, the retail LFG / LFR tools untether actions from consequences. 
---
Firstly, there is no personal investment in the success of a particular group.  
---
In retail you are instantly teleported to and from the dungeon instead of investing your time to travel there in most cases or experience a bit of a thrill and get summoned;
---
Thus you personally lose nothing if the group fails, which it mostly can't.
---
By the same token..
---
You have no personal investment in the success of your fellow adventurers because any of them can be replaced with no effort or delay.  
---
So at the first excuse anyone can be replaced, instead of helped.     
---
In classic you are incentivized to help your fellow players succeed because at best you will lost 30~60 min getting a replacement.
---
And Finally you have no incentive to behave like a civilized adult human in the group because at worst, you will get kicked, and have to wait in a queue for a few minutes.
---
Since the retail LFG is cross realm, the community is too large for even the most egregious bad actors to develop a bad reputation, because you almost never see anyone again, and you can't reliably communicate their behavior to their peers. 
---
There is no incentive to be a good citizen of your realm, because there are no meaningful consequences to NOT being one.
---
In vanilla the realm has a population cap, fragmented by faction.  
---
Further fragmented by level, and then soft fragmented by progression. 
---
The community of players you will want to be grouping with, and will be wanting to group with you is relatively small. If you behave badly, you will literally end up unable to run so much as a 5 man dungeon, because people simply won't let you in their groups.  
---
That is not super common, I only remember that happening to a handful of players on my server in vanilla, but reprobates are not tolerated.
---
Before that happens you will find yourself moving down the guild quality ladder, as the top guilds are extremely careful of their reputations, and people who do not know you personally will probably know your guild.  
---
So before you wind up forced to transfer servers to find a group, you will find it harder to keep a spot in a reputable guild, and your grouping experience will be influenced by people preferring reputable guild when they have the option.
---
the "LFG addons" in classic, just like the one's in vanilla can not group you with anyone from another server.
---
All the social dynamics remain entirely unaffected.  
---
Installing an addon won't get you in groups with people who all know you are a ninja.
---
Installing an addon will not decrease your personal investment in the groups success, because it will not make it one second faster to travel to the instance with your group, or to replace a lost/kicked member.
---
And all of their other arguments are total fabrications.
---
"you used to have to spam city trade chat so you had to stand in ironforge!"   
---
Only if you were too dumb to /join LookingForGroup      or before that was introduced you could  /join "General - Ironforge"
---
"OMG it autoinvites players!"  - except the addon dev already announced that feature isn't going to be in the classic launch release    And to be honest,  if it was it still wouldn't matter as it doesn't change anything *important.* 
---
It doesn't affect the social consequences for bad behavior.
---
The answer is that if a lazy method exists people who don't prefer it will eventually adopt it for the sake of shaving off time from their dungeon runs.
---
The option existing removes people from the manual hunt for a group as well so every person who adopts the addon is one less person to ask into a manual players group. This makes the hunt for players to play with worse for people who don't use the addon.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't remember tank and cc class searching for bc heroics fondly. But I do want a sense of community. If a person can just punch a button to get a replacement group then there's less tying them to a group they're already in. There's less motivation to get along with others and its one more layer removed from that sense of community. Why add friends if you'll just auto fill? Why get along or chat when there's no down time to get into the dungeon? Why accept weird classes when you can just kick until the meta mix falls into your group? Not everyone but certainly some will play this way and some of those will play this way regardless so why put in an addon that will encourage the attitude of the game away from what it was? I certainly don't remember these addons being prevalent on my vanilla server or even in bc and that is already against the grain of what the majority is asking for.
---
If this addon is required for someone to play this version of wow then they simply shouldn't. The flaw is integral to the experience many want from the game and and attempt to mitigate that flaw will deteriorate the community of the servers. Not as extremely as cross realm dungeon finding but certainly more than I want and more than the people decrying this mod want.
---
Go Hotw spec. Do not try to reinvent the wheel.
---
Where in the current blizzard ToS does it say that? https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal
---
Do you think a paladin would have the same effect as a priest? GF is going warlock and I'm torn between pally and priest.
---
I am excited to not use any addons and get the full classic feel.
---
Chill
---
TRUTH.
---
Childish BFA Fanboys won't want to hear it though. They're a different breed. They'll continue blazing through content as fast as they can and then bitch about lack of content afterwards, all while steamrolling dungeons without even the slightest fight from the enemy. All while not communicating with anyone in the party, only to be incredibly toxic in trade chat. It's so easy, and it's a snorefest. 
---
When everyone else is gone, because BFA sucks and Classic actually provides a rewarding experience both socially and with the game play... The BFA fan boys will cry, be lonely, or jump ship to Classic as well.
---
I keep warning people, Classic is going to kill the player base of BFA.
---
Thank you for understanding.
---
Hey, that sword has a proc to hurl a fireball, maybe I'll get in a tight spot and have to melee.  That extra 50 damage proc might make a difference!
---
^/s
---
Because pirate servers don't enforce blizzard TOS? These actions are bannable, and super obvious.
---
Answer their questions but don't lead them, follow them.
---
That's imo the best way
---
30 yr old is not boomer that's 50 you stop being dumb.
---
Damn you statistics, you cruel bitch!!!
---
Those kungen streams were so good!
---
Regular players don´t care that much for Devilsaur gear. And the pserver elitists are a tiny fraction of the population. they might find the outcome of this activity disappointing.
---
Big difference  in someone declining a group for a kill quest and declining a group for a rare. Know the difference and don’t be a douche :)
---
He's our everything.
---
Only eating some fruits and only 2 times eating a day is not what we normally do here. I know we are pricier here in switzerland but I was more on the "what and how often" than on the "how much it costs" part of the post.
---
For sure I can only pay 5$ a day and easily survive, and i on some days even might do it, even here. But I would not want to do it regularly.
---
I'm 33, I ditched High School to go get vanilla and was leveling through the day and then someone started spamming in the starting zone "Get out of the noob zone now! Kiddies are getting off school at 3pm!!!!!!!!!" So I ran farther into the game and skipped a few quests to get past the zerg of people getting out of school.
---
What I meant was he was not only switching factions but going Shaman.
---
after 12h of raiding each week
---
PvPRP, or just PvP?
---
Classic had a ton of stuff they could have expanded on. I had some cool ideas with the Hyjal one, such as the first fight being a dreadlord council that was resistance based, three dreadlords and one infernal as bosses. Each doing a different elemental damage to the tank, and one doing unmitigated damage (chaos magic) so you would need a druid tank for the very high HP. The infernal is obviously fire, another could be nature/poison, and the last frost. Kill order could matter. Then another raid boss could be a corrupted ancient, etc.
---
I think we will  be fine. What server you gonna play on?
---
I was trying to level for BFA, but leveling progression was so unrewarding that i quit.
---
What a terrible post, jesus
---
Sounds like you play dps
---
Okay, brainlet.
---
I’m not really super invested in this argument, but another part of the argument against is if it makes it easier to replace anyone.  Groups in Vanilla often would be a bit more long suffering with other players because booting them could severely slow down the run or just end it because replacements were harder to obtain.
---
There where always meetingstones but the summoning was later and is still in retail now. Why do you think everyone loved locks for summons
---
Only kids call other people kids because it makes them feel bigger, so you must be a really tiny kid.
---
hunter
---
did I mention hunter?
---
Already did, logged off of my warrior for the last time in Northshire, where it will all begin again
---
Dont worry all the zoomers are gonna get drafted, we wont have to deal with them for long
---
That is pretty much my plan for primary professions as well, except I'm going to keep mining so I can farm my own engineering mats at 60.
---
Because you don't wanna see someone type lol in chat when you say that you mainly play on dinglesberry or tootyfrooty
---
&gt; You're repeating yourself. 
---
So are you.
---
&gt; I already stated why that first point is false (It might have been changed since you tested it?) 
---
It hasn't.
---
&gt;I also already stated why comparing it to addons in the vanilla era is problematic, unless you have some sort of proof that a certain percentage of players used the addons you're talking about. 
---
Now the same tool is bad because you say so without citing any reasons.
---
&gt;This will be my final comment, since we simply seem to disagree and you're downvoting my every comment without taking in the information. 
---
Maybe now you'll actually read the features of the addon instead of replying to me constantly and watching every streamer make shit up.
---
Charles Manson.
---
Sounds like a party.  You bringing the lube or should I?
---
You're reading the quote wrong. It reads like this:  *"Pure blue eyes are quite rare in the orcish race, and are seen as a sign of great* ***density***."  So, you need to make the fattest orc possible.
---
Half my guild got a 48h ban in vanilla for farm-trading in AV with a major horde guild (most of the alliance side was my guild and most of the horde side was a major horde guild).
---
They were all farming turn-ins for rep to get the exalted epic rewards.
---
Luckily I was a priest and the rewards sucked for me so I was nowhere near that debacle.
---
Questie will indicate on your map where quest objectives are located. 
---
Classes that can do good DPS in Classic are mages, warlocks, rogues, hunter and warrior. You can DPS with the rest but not at the higher levels.
---
Could anyone make a timeline of each topic discussed?
---
Charles Manson I believe
---
&gt;people were standing around in Ironforge looking for tanks for their groups... 
---
Unless they were using CTA. Or Using the global LFG channel. Or using private LFG channels. Or using the meeting stone/inn keeper.
---
Yep. Essentially it says "slavery is illegal except as punishment for a crime".
---
And we can all guess what group got really hard vagrancy laws put upon them after the US Civil War, right?
---
Mmhmm. I was mostly just having a spot of fun, since my lifestyle isn't as active and I have a bit of a paunch as a result. So someone referring to my weight class as "thin" was mildly entertaining.
---
Ah, I see. You have a pretty good point there. I wonder how many people are still paying monthly for AOL.
---
The long con.  I like it.
---
Take everything you read on the internet with a pinch of salt. Even this comment!
---
Roll whatever makes you excited to play, Rogue is a popular class but if you play it well and you're sociable you'll find your way into a guild/raid easily.
---
It's the prerelease hype where people are clambering for anything to debate, soon as you boot up your Night Elf and get questing you'll forget all about it!
---
I like the debuff limit. Here is how I would like to see it changed.
---
As we know, the debuff limit was included because of technical limitations. I feel that it is appropriate for a raid boss to have a limit of 16 debuffs because they are powerful being who can resist any additional effects beyond 16. 
---
Any character that isn't a boss should have no debuff limit. They are affected by as many things that you can stack upon them.
---
Then for raid balance, we can tweak debuffs that certain classes bring to bring up their importance for more compositions. If for example you could somehow modify the Nature damage a target took, you could bring Elemental and Balance specs (minus the fact that they oom though). 
---
Like, when Blizzard added Vampiric Touch in BC to allow for Mana Regen the meme specs became better because they could sustain DPS AND it made a Spriest invaluable to the raid for that Debuff.
---
Iono, I'm spitballing here. A man can dream.
---
I like this. Either you need or you don’t need. I guess the only “do not” here is to need equipment and armor you cannot use?
---
bury it in a grave without plate
---
ok staceys mom calm down
---
I feel like we could talk about the cash grab Blizzard did with the Name Reservation a bit more :3
---
I mean they got like 1/2 a monthly subscription out of the People that were willing to spend that to reserve their names.
---
That is just outrageous!
---
I mean... The disappointment is immeasurable and my day is certainly ruined now!
---
what have I just read
---
can u get it early in vanilla? I know I had a 29 twink with it and it hit like bricks
---
but it was in wotlk
---
Math*
---
Ew no, I drink that water!
---
Those places are *overly* moderated.
---
I don't get why people just whisper 'inv' like that.  I always whisper my class + preferred role.  If you make it easy for people you're far more likely to get an invite.
---
Feel like a lot of people are also forgetting how much larger servers will be now compared to original vanilla, which ultimately means finding groups will be much easier as well. Totally support this add on getting blocked.
---
Keep classic great!
---
I just used tank because they used warrior as the example lol
---
Multiboxers normally just make the same type of toons so 1 button does the same action on all of them. Your going to have to set things up really weird to get a holy paladin to sync with a warrior and not have different controls for both.
---
Nah. Its exactly what I wanted.  
---
Addon that doesn't make you stare at the chat for an hour.  
---
Ill be using it. If you dont want to, feel free not to.  
---
Have fun staring at chat full of spam.
---
memegenerator.net
---
\*boop\*
---
You like apples and milk?
---
Also, it is imperative that you close your eyes so you aren't distracted .
---
You get that this add-on still uses an LFG channel? Yes it's automated in terms of inviting but Ninja in this case still needs to post "LFG ____" to that channel, so everyone in the channel can point out that he's a ninja.
---
I'm kinda worries the servers aren't actually full. But people have reserved names on all 3 old servers making the population larger than it seems
---
What exactly was retconned?
---
More lore was added but it really didn't change much otherwise. A retconn changes something.
---
Most look more like Pandaren females.
---
See you in Durotar 🕶️
---
TBH. I'd pay 500 bucks for a decent collectors

This is hilariously moronic. Those of us who have played for 15 years and never left should form a circle around you while you're keyboard turning in the starting zone.
---
The retail crowd is going to be shocked once they experience the autism levels of the private server crowd.
---
i used the shit out of call to arms
---
Aw fk yeah, a "quick strat run" with a lvl 54 tank and a lvl 50 druid healer, good times.
---
Most of those players should automatically get ignored anyway just because of their names alone, except for Sven.
---
While you could wear the cloth gear that tailoring creates lots of it later game wont be as helpful with bonuses to spells.  You could take it if you wanted a professions to feed enchanting to lighten that gold sink though. As for my suggestions, I was going off of the context of him being a Troll hunter and usefulness for that class all classes.
---
But there is no matchmaker. This is closer to forming a M+ group rather than queuing in LFD.
---
It’s worth noting that one of the best strategies for levelling the tough 25ish-40 stretch in vanilla, sit down self-crit, was nerfed so that you can’t automatically enrage by sitting down, so things are going to be very sticky.
---
Well, the nostalrius guild that ruined the mafia made millions of gold and were able to buy guild from both faction to lock the zones where the world boss were spawning so they were the only one killing them.
---
It's still your choice. Nobody can force you to use an addon.
---
Actually LFG addon existed in vanilla, so maybe you need to go back somewhere else  
---
NO CHANGES
---
Pvp is all i did in vanilla. some people sitting there "guarding" something would have been amazing fun to roll through.
---
lol, you don't need an add-on to coordinate a mafia.
---
I'm going to challenge this a bit. One of the main advantages of joining a guild was you can set a distribution rule for gear. Joining a pug for 2-3 weeks straight and not getting any gear will cause a lot of people to stop using LFG.
---
The reason it works on private servers is that there aren't a ton of people per private server. So it's easier to know the community in your server. Secondly in retail LFG raid pretty much gives you a good chance of getting items you need with class tokens. This doesn't even exist in classic.
---
So if you're looking to raid your best bet is joining a guild with a respectable loot distribution rule. Using LFG for raids in classic is asking for a bad time.
---
Care to elaborate on sometimes? I keep hearing this and its making me have a 50/50 split between rogue and lock.
---
At least Fairbanks will be remembered for something, right? Years from now we will look back and think about that one time someone tried to start a Mafia of the server.
---
Tauren and undead hate.....none in  the pic

Just dont use it 4Head

It's not sadness, it's concentration. If you accidentally pull one more murloc your ass is dead
---
Lol chop chop
---
Very affective.itd.burst damage can't.be matched but can't really.ne sustained like other forms of aoe and that's the trade off.
---
I couldn’t remember when the split happened. Good to know though. The duct tape stick still looked like crap though.
---
How much of a difference at Level 60 does that make?
---
Yep, I can see these "cleave" groups hitting 60 fast, but being undergeared for the level. There are still some very good world quest rewards.  
---
There probably aren't that many that will be able to pull it off. Five equally skilled players, with exact same play schedule, and spending hours and hours together without imploding.
---
Plus, I don't want to roll against 4 other people for a Briarwood Reed trinket or some other sweet drop.
---
The only thing that they need to break is the auto invite button.
---
I remember getting one shot by a 39 Enhance Shaman twink with Pendulum of Doom.
---
But they wont
---
because they think it somehow auto invites people and then teleports them to the dungeon. lmao
---
So what's your stance on healers like pally or shammy rolling on dps gear? When that Hand of Justice drops are you fine with the healer rolling on that?
---
My point exactly...  Weird ass dude who was accused of trying to get his dick touched by some young dude working as a massage therapist.
---
So we're doing C'thun with no helm no shoulders and no shoes? Is it happening?
---
I forgot we germans are too retarded to read the EU Forums, hence I didn't look into german ones. Well, good thing we (my group) prepare to switch on 26th if Qs are too long.
---
Trivia about Germany: We're also too retarded to keep movie titles as they are. So we simply rename them. You heard right, we don't translate, we actually change the freaking names. Most of the time we keep the main name and then just add random stuff as the secondary title.
---
He just had a stroke and became a statistic.
---
Or you could just not use it.
---
See that’s what is making me think, I’m not gonna be focusing on PVP but that doesn’t mean I’ll never do it.
---
what is this ancient alien technology
---
The "reality" one looks cool
---
&gt;but it's really seeming like half of the community is doing this.
---
Half of the community that is active in online forums. People will forever overestimate just how many players are actually active in that community. It's maybe like 15% of the playerbase and I'd say that's a pretty generous estimate.
---
I definitely think classic is gonna have the exact same population skew as retail. Hardcore is gonna be like 4% of the playerbase and they're gonna think that only they matter.
---
What so it's not 2019, or you don't think the game holds up?
---
You don't seem to get it. The game could be identical to vanilla, everything spot on down to the pixel. It would not be the same experience as playing in vanilla. There's too much interest in the game for attempts at gatekeeping and "the community should be this way" to work. The community will be how the community will be, based on however is interested in continuing to play the game after the initial launch period. Whether you agree with their opinions on how to pug a dungeon or not.
---
WTF -- You can get 1.1 kg of Paanut butter for $5.50  https://www.walmart.com/ip/Jif-Creamy-Peanut-Butter-40-Ounce/10308250
---
For human warrior, grabbing OEB is really good. You'll have 0 glancing blow dmg loss with it along with around +3% hit (been awhile so the hit is from memory) just from weapon skill alone.
---
Yea bud we already knew you were single.
---
I'm playing two gigs then retiring.
---
&gt; I see it as just another activity, and if you're discourage from that then you probably won't play classic for long honestly.
---
This sub: "I can't wait until I don't have to repeatedly grind meaningless content in order to have the basic tools I need to advance in the game"
---
Also this sub: "If you aren't excited about running Gnomeregan 70 times a day for a month in order to get as many of a necessary item as you can, you're not going to last long in Classic."
---
Pick a lane, man.
---
By my understanding, yes the queues will most likely be shorter.
---
Those MC debuffs were absolutely not balanced around decursive
---
i used it
---
But how will you get engineering mats if you also have tailoring.
---
And how many used em? Close to none, you clearly favor it because of retail, stay away you pest.
---
I prefer positive memories, not those which remind me of torture :(
---
You can pretty much see if they're fighting and only targeting specific people on opposing factions.  Those who do this are likely going to be obvious who is doing it and then it's a matter of observation.
---
Shitty.
---
Well I personally count is as an expansion but a expansion of history I guess. Lots of content and patches, a fresh start fresh everything and stuff to relearn and different play style
---
Well sorta, but that's not totally it. Wrath is the first expansion they went all in on catch up mechanics. Some of the questing gear in Northrend had similar stat weights to the tier 6.5 stuff.
---
The thing is it does not fucking matter at all if we here say yes or no to such addons, because if they can exist, people WILL use them. So the problem (if it still exists, last time I heard about such addon possibility was at blizzcon) should be addressed on technical level by blizzard themselves, no alternatives.
---
I wonder why the Scandinavian community seems to be split between Denmark/Norway Firemaw and Sweden/Finland with Gehennas. Wasn’t there a Nordic server?
---
I also wonder where most British people are going to play.
---
The first one. A name is made rad by the deeds done by the one who holds the name. No name is rad in and of itself.
---
Just having characters on each side doesn't count as collusion.
---
&gt; So for example they could give a Druid with a crowd pummeler a higher gs from that than they would get from any other item in the game
---
A Druid with a single crowd pummeler isn’t properly geared though.
---
How will the addon tell that they have an adequate number in their bags, to deal with the raid you’re about to enter. 
---
Again. It’s not that simple.
---
New to English atleast
---
The addon is so basic that most other addons would stop working in the process.
---
Then go dwarf and keep your feet on the ground.

F is for flash

I didn't, had 3 on RPPVP, tryed to make one on shazz and it was fine.
---
Not angry lol. You are the one who made a complaint. I just responded that it's a foolish one. This is still not a 'repost'. I still used hyperbole and you continue (for like the 4th time now) to tell me as much. 
---
I hope I don't see you, you'll likely be telling noobs how their builds are just the same builds you've always seen and nobody is being unique enough for you XD
---
The best reply, cause that's exactly what I do with my wife.  I always drop the game when she needs me and I also tell her that I'm going into a raid leave me alone! Lol but yes this is the best advice.
---
Cleaning
---
I like that people are being dramatic about this.  Oh, you mean some video game edgelords with massive egos are talking shit in game?  Who cares.  They're just advertising they'll be easy wpvp targets with confirmed locations.
---
The auto-invite feature of this addon wont be available on live servers, so no worries
---
It's not an expansion
---
Using item LVL as a metric seems like a surefire way to shoot yourself in the foot, considering that BiS at any stage tends to vary extremely on a per slot basis.
---
&gt; You've already shown you can't handle losing rolls on things 
---
Never said or "shown" anything about myself.
---
&gt; think theres supposed to be some kind of heirachy to pug needing items. 
---
Never said there is supposed to be. I said either say beforehand you are going to roll on an item that barely affects you or you are kind of a dick for rolling on it. Yes, I understand you don't need to care about others in a pug but I am saying some people will be mad and for a reason.
---
&gt;  You threatened to blacklist me from gear if I roll on gear.  
---
I never did such a thing, learn to read.
---
&gt; You pretend you know what it's like in vanilla despite never playing vanilla. 
---
Early TBC is close enough, it's really that different for a new player.
---
&gt; How am I projecting at all? 
---
Are you tense? I already said this, by claiming things about me you have no way of knowing if they are true or not.
---
&gt; You've already stated you're going to stop responding like 4 times now 
---
Never said it, you are full of shit as usual.
---
&gt; pretending like I'm the one that's a sore loser 
---
I have met enough dumb people like you in my life to know they are not self aware enough, they will never get the point.
---
&gt; who lack any sort of self reflection. 
---
Speak of the devil.
---
problem is (from what i gather) this addon scans the chat, so youll still need people in chat in order to form group  
---
but at least it will filter through all the spam, which is cancer to say the least  
---
never again do i want to go through that miserable experience
---
They were in vanilla and were fine.
---
P.S gave you some gold for this reply
---
You may not be old but you're way out of touch apparently.   
---
You were a kid when you played vanilla, if you did, don't be a dick to kids playing now.
---
Exactly, that why I went with that title. Didnt expect it to throw people off that much :D
---
The 5% int gnomes get is pretty pointless too.  I think it was 700ish more mana and &lt;1% spell crit.
---
You still need to buy the latest expansions though don't you? At least to see the latest content.
---
LOL I did the exact same. I hopped on my level 100 char from WoD, tried the Legion Intro Quest chain thing with all the cinematics. And I was like WTF is all this shit, for 30 mins straight and then logged off. Waiting for Classic, playing retail is not the way to kill time.
---
They have 0 reason to ban it. It's not breaking any rules.
---
Practically none.
---
Forsaken vs Troll for pvp server. Will do a lot of wpvp and bg.
---
Is forsaken racial to god to pass up? I think it is.
---
If you're considering not playing with your friends for the sake of a name, then they're not really your friends.
---
Very cool.
---
Thats the cool way to do it. I will always accept a grp invite if accompanied by a whisper when doing a quest.

And the tank F4s because it’s taking too long. So the ret pally (dps) restarts the i’ll tank process but now that there are only 2 people it fully breaks down as the pally hearths and you never hear back from them as they afk getting food irl...

No 3 name limit when the new servers drop. Get in and spam those 2/3 letter words until you've reached the per-server limit.
---
&gt;I've been playing since 2007.
---
Yeah, you and everyone else.
---
&gt;No one likes microtransactions.
---
I like micro-transactions if server transfers fall under that. So evidently that's not true.
---
Gouge
---
Play with your friends dummy
---
Regardless if they were in vanilla. Microtransactions in general are a hideous atrocity to plague games since its conception.
---
Thrall take the wheel!!!
---
Ya that's nasty, that little french fuck needs to clean that thing damn
---
in terms of player relationships and interactions, yes, ccp takes a hands-off approach. in fact, there was a cartel in eve (OTEC) for years between the two largest coalitions in the game controlling the price of a vital commodity (technetium) by controlling all of the sources of it across the entire game world, and ccp was fine with that
---
but botting and rmt are things that get you turbobanned from eve, and with some expedience
---
the joke here is that ccp's gms will often "check the logs" when a ticket is submitted, but they never seem to show any relevant information
---
But it gives you a full day of preparation!
---
I mean I’d rather send an npc to do a mindless fetch quest than have to do it myself. But to each their own.

---
Thank you for the laugh, so unexpected
---
More like make a lfg addon that is just /who
---
You are the definition of a troll because you know those add-ons never gained any traction during all of vanilla but yet now that you are so used to that crap in retail you can't live without it. Blizz will most likely kill this :)
---
The real windfury... the one that ruins lives.
---
Then there was no point to the comment.
---
MODS, REMOVE THIS HORDE PEONASANT FROM MY SIGHT AT ONCE!
---
Yes, in vanilla it's a struggle to not go OOM while in live it's a struggle to keep people alive without going oom. 
---
I have done mythic raiding in live and played classic and classic wasn't hard, it was just slow while in live you have a timer to beat so there is always a strain to complete a dungeon.
---
so many uninformed people just assuming shit in here. its maddening.
---
Imagine if they didnt you parrot, the shit show on launch would be tremendous,
---
D3 got a lot of shit when it was released by the die-hards, but I actually liked it a lot more than D2. And I played the fuck out of D2.
---
It’s not like the sub ended. They can still jump and get their name on the new server if they’re fast enough
---
I always loved how a lot of Americans think everything revolves around them and their timezones.
---
Who is that chick tho?
---
An automated `above game tool` moves your character from one server to another, you can not argue this is a game mechanic in any form, because it is not, it falls out of what is considered apart of the game.
---
I do get it, and i remember it. i remember spending countless hours looking for that last person to fill a spot, a lot of the groups disbanding before we even got a group together, those are not fund memories. 
---
The fund memories was when we actually played the content, defeating Baron Riverdale or getting my second dal'rend blade so i had the pair. 
---
But standing half afk in IF spamming LFG is not fun for most people.
---
I think it was around 300-500g for the set.
---
If you plan to PvP then you'll want to drop Tailoring after Robe of the Archmage and start leveling Engineering (Gnomish first for BoP items, then Goblin and stay there forever).
---
If no PvP then you can hold onto Tailoring but you'll probably want Herbalism either way. It's the best gold farming profession.
---
I play on Xbox, gonna see how far I can get between today and Monday. 
---
For Xbox season starts at 5pm pst
---
Same as with my langauge.
---
"Vroeg opstaan" vs "Vroeg wakker word"
---
Who builds contacts purely from the people who spam trade? It's not like "Hey, that guy fills my trade with LFG everyday, I should add them to my friends list!", you add people who you connect with during the actual content. An addons gets groups quicker, gets you in content quicker, and gives you more opportunities to find good people to play with. You will still see them on the server, you can still build a reputation.
---
If it isn't going well, you NEED to change something up. Being soft-locked into a group because of convenience isn't going to make the weak healer heal better. It's not going to make an under geared tank tougher. Being able to quickly reform is definitely a boon to a lot of players who are "time-restricted", and it doesn't prevent people from doing it the old fashioned way. It'll cut down on people looking in trade, but that's part of adaptation. Saying we shouldn't allow an addon that streamlines lfg is like saying we should artificially support jobs that are automated.
---
Nah, you’re good. Welcome back
---
Look dude the fact that you ported instantly to dungeon and x-realm groups was the main reason LFG in retail was so hated. This addon does nothing of the sort. And I mentioned porting because not everyone seems to grasp that concept and most here believe this addon is the revival of the retail LFG.
---
Sure you can, but it's difficult without a higher level to help you complete the quests.. i think the last boss in that chain is lvl 40 or something
---
So without paying money how else would you regulate these? As there's still the need to process your character from one database onto the other. Which is using resources etc.
---
Hi asmongold!
---
To stay logged in WoW you have to be active, the game kicks you if you're afk for more than I think it's 15 minutes, 30 minutes on char selection.
---
After that being said, if people want to legit play all day and night, it's up to them, noone has the right to prevent it.
---
Also noone is forced to take time off work to play a game, if they do and just waste their time, it's still up to them, noone else can be blamed for it.
---
Yahooo! Missed him so much!

A normal person isn't eating a 3rd of a jar of peanut butter for breakfast dude, a normal serving is 2 tablespoons or about 10% of what you're eating. A "normal" breakfast of oats and milk is usually around £0.13 without toppings.

I never said it should be "allowed", to "allow" it would be a change. NOCHANGES
---
Engineering always helps, it adds extra utility to fights that no other professions can match. Classic WoW had few and far between CCs and gap closers, most classes have 1/2 stuns and maybe one gap closer. That is why engineering is so useful, because just having an extra stun/dash was a noticeable increase. That's also why items such as skull of impending doom, nifty stopwatch, tidal charm, etc. are such valuable items as well. Adding two more stuns (bomb/tidal charm), two more dashes (rocket boots, skull of impending doom) gives you far more utility, and provides a noticeable advantage. *Having said all of this,* as a mage you are already have some of the most pvp utility and survivability and not having engineering will be less of a crutch compared to paladins, for example. It's up to you, but as a mage it will be less imperative to have engineering as a must have and you will be just fine without it.
---
tl;dr It is not as much of a must have for mages as other classes, but it is certainly advantageous.
---
Thought this was for retail because once classic launches retail is just a memory that had its ups and downs
---
You are acting like you are 58
---
The Z is silent.
---
Assuming that people will bother to put their linen into the AH during this stage.
---
Also, remember taking permafrost still leaves you open to aoe farming occassionally
---
lmao. the DEFINITION of the game being not just about you but the party!
---
Devilsaur mobs are elite enemies in the Un'Goro Crater zone, who can be skinned for Devilsaur leather. Said leather is needed to make some absolutely baller pre-raid melee pants and gloves, which give crit chance and attack power, but are a 2 piece set which grant very important hit rating when wearing both.
---
So people on private servers would form "Devilsaur Mafia" groups who would take complete control of the spawns to ensure only they were the ones able to provide the leather, and in turn control the selling of that gear.
---
I use https://www.savorytooth.com/instant-pot-chicken-tikka-masala/ but I change it a bit. Rather than adding the cream after it's pressure cooked, I add it before. I think it gives it a better texture. Also I use thigh meat (trimming off the excess fat) as it adds more flavor.
---
It costs Activision 'X' dollars to server BFA to customers, and that generates revenue from subs, mtx, and merchandise. It costs Activision that same 'X' dollars to server Classic to customers, and that only generates revenue from subs and (potentially) merch. That means less profit per dollar of cost. 
---
Plus, I would be surprised if Classic had Growth potential. In other words, will there be growth in Classic subscribers year over year? My guess is No.
---
Classic will make a nice splash on the next quarterly revenue announcements, but if those numbers are down year over year (next year), then the trajectory of WOW will remain unchanged.
---
This is why nobody likes alliance.
---
One thing that really bugs me about retail is how we are given "The most powerful weapon" only to later aquire "The more most powerful weapon" that is later again replaced...Same with armor ofc and the designs on the gear have gone batshit. I like functional yet fantasy looking gear, not these spiky glass flameballs with floaty bits.
---
I have two young kids.. weekends are just a second job (day care) for me. Make breakfast for the kids, get them to their various swim and ballet classes, nap/quiet times, attempt to pick up the house a bit, figure out dinner, get kids to bed, plop on the couch with a drink for an hour or two and fall asleep. Repeat for Sunday, basically.
---
I look forward to slipping WoW Classic into that gap between kids in bed and sleeping. I may also make extra sure they are in bed on time, to maximize WoW time.
---
I'm actually shocked that people are now complaining so much about new servers after spending the whole week begging Blizzard for more servers.
---
The past few weeks I’ve been playing d2 again! Really enjoyed it for the challenge and helped me keep my mind off classic
---
Ah yes. If we're not excited enough to fake insanity we aren't ready
---
Has Blizzard ever commented on the Devilsaur Mafia bullshit?
---
my suggestion is to look up the addons you want at Willitclassic.com and install them manually. 
---
A few of the addons I’m using:
---
Details (this is your damage meter)
---
MapCoords (map coordinates)
---
TitanClassic (Titan Panel for Classic)
---
I'm actually considering moving the whole guild to Gandling, awesome name
---
F is for the "Oh Fuck" keybind.
---
Warrior sux play something else :)
---
*guild with “warrior” in the name*
---
*no warriors allowed*
---
Yeah.. 1 hour at work pays for 1 month of WoW classic for me.
---
I'd legit rather work for an hour than play retail for 5.
---
Because it does.
---
I feel the same as this guy.
---
feral is not really a thing insofar is that it is a meme, rogues are superior.
---
Yeah, super excited to start whispering random players asking them to do a dungeon
---
TeamViewer, my friend.
---
By the time you get your mount, you’ll probably be in incredible shape haha
---
You: "I want Blizzard to cater exclusively towards me and make changes to Classic WoW to ban behavior I don't like".
---
Also You: "WoW Classic isn't for you if you don't like what Blizzard is delivering".
---
You have the big gay TBH.
---
I can't wait to get windfury proc'd and die in 1 shot. i'll be ok with it. iirc in raids youd have a shaman in each melee group for windfury, right?
---
Private server players will most likely use it, people from vanilla who used the similar addon 'CTA' will probably use it. Not using it just means you'll have much more /2 spam to scroll through.
---
Good choice
---
are you playing dumb? guilds and private chats are part of the game, this is addon which is made possible by the new API's developed by blizzard throu the years
---
Sitting down to drink could be dangerous as af too. In STV you really gotta be careful about drinking.
---
Or when a Tauren gets it.

+1 to counterspell or kick, F is the perfect placement.

FYI: The lfg system was already in vanilla. If you talk to an Innkeeper, (or press a meeting stone) you can get queue'd to dungeons that fits your level.
---
The system is trash tho, and I will be spamming chat with the rest of y'all!
---
Hey there, the guide is amazing, well done. There is a bug tho in the **Level 1-10 notes** section your keybinds sheet is not working!
---
Like i said  you wont be needing F in classic
---
How required are the consumables, would you say?
---
Don’t see it in the ToS? Care to elaborate how you know this bannable? Are you clairvoyant?
---
Great job moving goal posts.
---
Guess I can be glad I have a boyfriend who grew up gaming, so he can relate to my hype and understands that we won’t see each other for 8 days following classic launch.

There's a lot wrong with being alliance though.

---
Nah Hogger probably can't wait to slap some ass, like the Chad he is.
---
I know partially its bc warlocks have an easier time on horde bc of will of the forsaken.
---
For the people who want TBC, why is this? I really am just curious.
---
Besides it being a great xpac (I loved TBC and Wrath) by why advocate this instead of classic +? Wouldn’t going the xpac route take us back to retail? I don’t see Blizzard creating new content for previous expansions
---
Keeping in mind that r/classicwow managed to hit r/popular, so its activity is probably being inflated.
---
The auto invite simply sends an invite to people who whisper 'Invite Please'. Most people will not use this, because it doesn't guarantee an actual dungeon comp 1 tank / 1 healer / 3 dps. Blizzard doesn't even need to worry about this, because the feature itself is pretty much useless.
---
It certainly didn't help that players were raiding ICC for ages with that 30% buff, only to get slapped across the face with more difficult content again with the Cata heroics.
---
Grob mob reporting in
---
10 of storms, bro I fucking love it equipped on thex! My fav addition so far. Keep it up
---
Thank you soo much
---
Hardest part about PuGs is making kids understand how aggro works. And Warlocks speccing Destruction and spamming life tap+shadow bolt and complaining about dying :P
---
Ok bro. People seem to be misunderstand when I say skill I mean being able to move out of fire and debuff. Somehow skill now means ridiculous ability to min max.
---
More like 7 million+.
---
Only once. I know what classic is and when it’s out, no need to Kill myself over it
---
&gt; They already paid though
---
Exactly, no wonder people aren't moving. They paid to get their spot, if they move now it's like throwing their money in the trash.
---
Well the multiboxers aren’t going to be using LFG, so I think they’re the good guys now.
---
hi from blaumeux
---
Yeah they literally used the "Break glass for Illidan" thing after the shit show WoD was, now they have Sargeras and Illidan packed away for the next time they need to win people back.
---
They are going Grobbulus now, don't ask how I know.
---
It needs a second frame, same thing, except the undead is gone.
---
kek
---
I can't decide between Hunter and Druid. I plan to PvP mostly and just run PvE to gear. Which class would be better for PvP in the first few phases?
---
&gt;WAAAA BLIZZARD PLS BAN ADDON THAT ALREADY EXISTED I DONT LIKE IT  
---
&gt; no im not panicking  
---
its not good to lie  
---
Thanks, I will. Obviously if they change the ToS or I hear about people getting banned then I wouldn't see any reason to try it, but it seems clear that if nothing in the ToS applies to it then it's not bannable.
---
And here again... you clearly demonstrating that you don’t understand. 
---
Blizzard likely knew all too well that the servers launched on name reserve was not going to cut it, but it generates hype, more interested and develops a clearer picture of whats to come. They know they can spin up additionals in no-time. 
---
You didn’t know better. You just look at it fron your subjective standpoint as a gamer who wants to log into the game and quest in five nanoseconds on launch day. You don’t understand how to launch a game.
---
Imagine giving a shit about the LFG addon

---
I see you've never played Alterac Valley.
---
"alright, I'll just have a little bit of god"
---
For the Horde!!
---
You'll need potions of fire resistance and flasks and stuff. World buffs etc. This is for raiding, not dungeons though.
---
Too much soy makes the boy not grow
---
I started mine today, looking at it going... why did I just waste a few days of time lol
---
EVERY MORNING RIGHT WHEN I WAKE UP AND EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED
---
they are the best dps in the games along with mages until warriors get tier gear. finding groups is harder for all dps but at least you arent a ret pally or dps shaman
---
Yeah this is what I mean by skill, not min/max ability. I guess I meant understanding of simple raid mechanics.
---
They use a unified ToS for all blizzard games, though it mentions WoW in some parts: https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal
---
It's a chat parser lmfao.
---
Tfw you think youre an epic genius but you dont know what level locks get summon or that youd need 2 others to summon the add on user LMAO
---
Why
---
I still have vanilla addons from those olden times. Plan to try them first.
---
Everything is black and white right?
---
I am against it.
---
I can also see conditional arguments for it.
---
Can you not see both sides?
---
Want me to rephrase for low iqs? Gladly.
---
Personally I am against a boost. Although as a rationalist an argument can be made for people who want to boost an alt, prepare for future phases (faster) and wpvp.
---
There's still time. All they need to do is run a process to invert the east/west direction of the whole world, and swap East and West in all place names.
---
Our entire play group is going horde because even though 7/8 of us prefer alliance there’s one person who flat out refuses to play anything but horde. So we’re like, whatever dude fine
---
absolutely
---
F is strafe right for me, ya pleb.
---
Hell, we don't even own our characters, we're paying for access to them, basically renting them.
---
Source of thumbnail whitemane art?
---
They are.
---
There's plenty of druid guides out there that answer all your questions.
---
Everything does revolve around us, at least more than others.
---
The average person has accumulated so much physical mass that our gravitational pull is superior to you non-Americans. 
---
That’s just science friend.
---
*yes*, absolutely. Getting your tailoring to 300 is really the most difficult part, the mats for Archmage really aren't that bad, and neither is the pattern cost usually.
---
these are brilliant.  MORE!
---
Not too bad, you’ll be fine. But yeah there’s always something in the way
---
Ret pally is the best dps 😳
---
Y'all actually think classic is gonna be more popular than retail. I'm not sure if I should laugh at your delusion or pity them
---
Classic will have a good launch but after a month most people are gonna get bored and move on. It'll have a dedicated playerbase but it won't come close to the sustained numbers of retail, especially when a new expansion hits.
---
Or just let people play and enjoy the game how they want? This addon isn't stopping you from playing how you want in any way
---
I think its going to boom! people wont want to play Herod ( intense numbers), or Faerlina (too many god dam streamers), Thalnos is Brazil 2.0, and that leaves good old Reliable!
---
It wont surpass it
---
You realize that it's Blizzard's servers and they can literally ban anyone for any reason regardless of what's in the ToS, right? This isn't like a court of law.
---
Add-ons that existed in vanilla existing for classic proves we arent ready for classic? Wot m8?
---
All gnomes deserve to be ganked on boats
---
My plan was imma just play and my plan is still imma just play.
---
Dude, you made friends *running* the dungeon, not spamming trade chat "LF 1 MORE HEALER BRD". I cannot fathom why some people think a tool that improves JUST finding a group is bad.
---
It was a druid! No wonder he could only rez one of them.
---
Staniscool
---
First off no classic dev agreed that it will effect the community, you just made that up.
---
Secondly, Ion talks about changes made to the API that will enable the creation of addons that can communicate with each other and can be used to create social networks within the game, this does none of that.
---
What's the exact origin of that phrase, I can't find it anywhere and I'm dying of curiosity
---
Just play casually lol.
---
The answer is that the best class is the one you enjoy the most. Sounds like mage isn't for you.
---
I think most classes have a tempo with boring moments. Some mages probably wand a lot to lessen their drinking time. Some probably blow their Mana and drink. Find something to do while you drink. Organize your bags, chat with a stranger, take a break and fish when you're tired of the drink/kill drink/kill pattern.
---
😂😂😂
---
I don't know how terrible it was in terms of creating groups because there just wasn't anyone using it. It'd be interesting to see if it works and how well it works on classic.  
---
I think the main problems from LFD on live is that it teleports people to the dungeon and it groups you with people not on your server. Old meeting stones system and these add on's while making group finding easier aren't on the same level or have the same effects as LFD.  
---
IMO alot of people in this thread are overreacting because they think it will have the same effects as LFD without actually thinking about how it plays out.
---
Meet up at 60
---
Dude, Hogger has a house and a family since we were all robbing him 15 years ago. He would very much appreciate you not killing him, robbing him, then taking screenshots while tea-bagging his corpse.
---
When I was tanking in vanilla wow, our rule was “you pull threat, you tank it”.
---
This made me fucking lol
---
I think every one is making way too big a deal about graphical authenticity. Gameplay was what made Classic great, not shitty graphics. If they keep the systems authentic, I really don't care about graphics. In fact I'd kinda like the option to have new player models. Yes. I said it.
---
Wait, that's a good tip, where did you hear that? So it is best to login 29 mins before launch?
---
This looks amazing! I definitely want to try this!
---
Leveling may be slower, and some mechanics will be a lot more difficult, but damn you’ll be able to experience every encounter! Like when you accidentally pull to many mobs and you have to run away, you’ll be legit running for your life.
---
Also make sure you don’t overdo this. I’d hate for you to get hurt while trying this.
---
I guess that would explain why I am surrounded by other people that talk about Classic.  I'm a software dev, haha.
---
Oh God I remember that shit back in vanilla. Hats off to you tanks for dealing with that.
---
I used to be a dps kitty and remember sitting around waiting for that tank to get their claws in. Then the many times someone jumped the gun on it and ended up screwing up things.
---
Good luck lol

---
Likely his highest achievement in vanilla was completing Dire Maul
---
Yeah it does look one sided. I'm starting with a Paladin for this reason but if I don't like the class I was going to go Tauren Druid or Orc Warlock.
---
Someone should make a AOE Dungeon Party LFG addon. So more people can get the 60 in 3 days played!
---
I will be maining a druid in classic but i need an alt for split raid reasons. I really dont want to play anything but my druid so im having a hard time to decide my alt. At the moment im leaning towards mage for a couple of reasons.
---
They seem quite easy to play in raids, FB FB FB (decurse will be same as druid so np).
---
Ease of transportation with portals.
---
Free water and food!
---
Doesn't have to carry around a bunch of crap in the bags (totems, gear, shards etc). 
---
Quite easy leveling. 
---
Wanted for dungeons (might dungeon lvl as my druid will solo lvl to 60).
---
Im thinking i might aswell use the mage as abit of a bank char, easy to use portals and the avaliable bag space to run around selling stuff.
---
Is the above more or less correct? Also what proffesions is recomended (main will be herb/alch) ? Keep in mind this char will mainly be to just fill a raid slot and bank with, i dont really care for it other then that.
---
The sheet is broken.
---
Reducing the hr/day investment increases the xp/day to astronomical levels and allows you to always be on track.
---

---
Same with me but I’ll be pwning alliance to the dirt
---
I just used tank as example because they said warrior lol
---
WHO THE FUCK CARES ITS A GAME
---
Right now Fairbanks, Herod and Thalnos are all over 58% horde.  Assuming that's accurate, they're going to be completely unfun servers for alliance.
---
If you read the whole comment chain and some of the comment section, you'd know what I'm talking about. Making stupid sarcastic jokes about people saying 27th really doesn't seem like speaking of one's own perspective. Maybe that's just me, idk.
---
For me, it's hands down the best non-combat utility in the game.  Frees up your hearthstone to be at an optimal location at all times, but you're still free to head to a capital city instantly. Lets your teammates leave dungeons for free. Is so convenient that people will literally give you money while you're standing in town, just for clicking 1 of your inherent class abilities. Vanilla WoW is slow with the running everywhere and not even a slow mount until 40. Having that kind of macro-scale mobility is really hard to give up.
---
He does, in fact, and in the Classicast, he mentioned that the dev team posts pictures of the memes at the office. :)
---
...what?
---
what class pairs well with priest? preferably not cloth
---
Good. One sub, one character online. That's the game.
---
This really speaks to me. Boats were always chaos on my server.
---
I had this issue with the 1.12 client for pservers. Disabling SLI fixed my issue. Though it doesn’t look like you’re running a dual GPU setup.
---
For the record, no one "created arbitrary scores for gear." Items have always had item levels in WoW since the beginning, and those item levels were always right there in the API for anyone to see.
---
What happened was that Blizzard started making gear more and more balanced, so that two item level 200 items were roughly close enough in power for most classes that you could start using that metric to get a rough estimate of whether a player had enough gear to do a piece of content based only on the item level instead of actually needing to look at each piece of gear individually.
---
Also, for the record, people already always inspected and later used the armory to try and determine if the player they were recruiting for the dungeon or raid had any clue what they were doing. Including in Vanilla. It was just a little more complicated when you actually had to read the stats on the items rather than just look at a single number.
---
I was in the 30's when it came out and not embarrassed to admit I love the game and can't wait to play classic again. 
---
I really hope you lower levels can hack the journey you're about to begin because it is really worth it. I fear the state of games today and retail has really messed with people and catered to the let's go fast crowd. 
---
Stick with it people you won't be disappointed.
---
Despite people's ignorance to the subject, blizzards anti-cheat system has the capability to detect these exploiters.  It's highly likely that these protocols are in place and bumping the people using them.
---
That decision is remains on blizzards shoulders though, as these exploiters will reaffirm Blizzards requests for players to move servers by prolonging the queues for others.  
---
I still expect many ban waves to happen though, just as it did in the old days.
---
nice meme, 5/7
---
i don't have an account yet so when i click 'test for free' it start to download the 60gb client.
---
Trying to make out that highway sign...Netherlands? Laan sounds v Dutch, and you can see the reefer smoke lingering in the dusk.
---
Wait. They've changed in retail? And made them worse?
---
It's funny - I played on a blizzlike pserver with ~3.5k pop [redacted] which is still active now,
---
and people *do not use LFG or ilvl addons.*
---
Perhaps it is the influx of retail players, but people seem to be treating ilvl and LFG addons are inevitable. Blizzard should step in and disable these addons like they said they would.
---
the farts come out of their mouth. some call them burps
---
Some wands in the 10-30 range will out dos your frostbolt/fireball if you're getting hit.  You'll regen mana faster and not spend 30s drinking every 3 mobs since you aren't nova and kiting and burning mana all the time.  
---
If you're going to aoe farm, wands are for stragglers since you'll be drinking anyway.
---
How often do you take $7 and just throw it into the trash?
---
Agreed. Totally sucked the emotion out of the character faces.
---
Time gated content that is power creeped into pointlessness is not the same as being able to grind obscure power ups.
---
A gearscore type addon can be made that instead of looking at ilvl or even scores for individual pieces can just calculate the sum of the relevant stats provided by the gear and provide a score based on actual stats and how they compare to the prebis and raidbis stats for each spec/phase.
---
I agree. Horde-players are dedicated and alliance-players are busy trying to hide the fact that they like to suck dick. Good meme!
---
Where might i be able to see what time the realms go up? I work the morning shift on the 27th and need to make sure my wife throws me in queue if I'm gone
---
Staaaahhhp. Gear matters in some areas of the game. It's not going to change. This is a 15 year old argument with literally no one. People who use gear level (fucking everyone) are going to keep looking at it for certain dungeons because assholes always ruin runs because they aren't ready to do certain areas yet and the rest of us don't want our time wasted.
---
You forgot the lock saying they can't summon, "Oops, out of soul shards"
---
Lol, youre such an idiot. Your friends are over there; go join them.
---
Stop being such a bigot.
---
So much this. I have social anxiety and MMO's in general can teach people so many things in the real world, and I feel like people dont understand this.
---
I'm pretty excited because I get to casually shepard a couple of complete newbies along on their journey and I'm honestly looking forward to that. I've already done intense raiding and no-lifing wow in my life, and now I get to kick back, not take it too seriously, and have a little new player experience vicariously. 
---
However, I'm *fully* expecting that vanilla wow is not the game that some people are anticipating and there is going to be some decent chunk of the initial population who decides it is not for them within the first couple weeks.
---
Felwood. I leveled up first time there with a warlock and I loved it. Really fit her well
---
&gt;irrelevant pixels on your screen
---
you're playing a game. if you want relevant pixels try investment banking
---
Yeah that's true, for PVE it might make sense.
---
I can't until we get a new error code to meme about, too.
---
Name a more insecure gaming community lol. Who do you need to convince?
---
Make an account 1st if doesn’t have to be active
---
The amount of pepe memes you see on this sub and the amount of red-hats would seem surprising until you realize something simple - the people whose lives suck and long to return to their childhood obviously align ideologically with the group of people who tell them that they can return to their "glory days" by voting for an oompa loompa that escaped from Wily Wonka's Chocolate Factory. 
---
There are plenty of fine, normal people planning to return to WoW Classic, but the most vocal, most extreme element of the community NEED Classic rather than just look forward to it - because they need to feel that sense that they can go back to before they were a failure.
---
Old Blanchy is badass though. It's a reference from the Southpark wow episode and it's a memed character in general.
---
My manager at work took off all of next week, and I'm debating whether I should ask her what it's for.
---
Well I mean, maybe I just didn't get it? My autism does that shit a lot, it's hard for me to understand sarcasm/jokes sometimes.
---
I started commenting here as a joke aswell, maybe I was sounding too serious? Idk, I'm still trying to learn.
---
Ok so a big issue that I have is toxicity and ease of remaking groups. Without this addons if you wiped in deadmines and your leader wanted to rage kick a group member it would cause a massive wait time. You would need to rez, leave the instance and look for a new group member. This inconvenience directly encourages you to not kick people for minor mistakes and really helps remove a level of toxicity from dungeons. It's better to help your group learn than to regroup.
---
My worry is this addons makes regrouping to easy so if say I'm in a group and we wipe and for whatever reason the leader can easily kick and replace that person. They kick,  open the addon, que someone in westfall pops up they inv run in and bam your back to the dungeon
---
This encourages people to play the game in a toxic way , booting people from groups becomes way easier thanks to the addon. It will affect every player.
---
Lololol nice one
---
Literally this. The addon can't pair you cross realm. It can't teleport you to the dungeon.
---
Let it just show you a list of characters, their levels, their classes, and what dungeons they are interested in running. Then you click on a name to send a message. Throw out the auto invite. But lfg add-ons for dungeons shouldn't be banned on principal.
---
I told mine she had dibs on the Switch while I am distracted with Classic. She's halfway through the Blue Lions route in FE Three Houses.
---
This seems like the perfect fit for a spiderman meme
---
Good, no offense, but you dont belong if you dont want to play the game.
---
Shut up you lame ass role playing bitch
---
Yeah, I’ve seen that thread. What’s wrong with people voicing their opinion on that matter?
---
This is pretty nice, actually.
---
Going deep frost, perma, imp CoC, etc is my preferred why to level frost.  
---
That being said, clearcasting is great, especially when you get imp CoC so make rank CoCs for damage are a common occurrence.  Clearcasting is 10% mana return in the worst case, but ideally you are converting procs on cheap spells into use on expensive.  Rank 1 Novas clearcasting into make rank flamestrikes or cone is really amazing in aoe situations.  
---
Also the first 5 points in arcane are very good.  Leveling you have no +hit, and while you get frost and fire hit from the frost talent, your poly and counter spell are arcane, and it can be a very big deal for those spells to be resisted.  The 2pt talent that gives spell penetration is irreplaceable early on with how rare spell pen is.
---
Why /s? It is bad
---
Shit, I remember that. No quests available and the only way to get XP was to grind mobs. I think that happened in the late 40's, those levels seemed to drag on and on...
---
I can't comprehend why they wouldn't launch two of those four new PVP realms during this weekend and have them locked for new players so that people on the full realms have a chance to get their names on them, to make them want to move. But that makes too much sense for Blizzard to do.
---
Because that's a waste of a GM's time. Its not sad, its a company making a cost-effective decision.
---
Clarifying before the run that you roll on dps gear as tank is fair. But if we are in the dungeon and the tank starts rolling on dps gear though, I'd probably roll too as the healer.
---
Yeah man, I'm sure there are a ton I'm forgetting. I got to enchant all kinds of cool shit from SHORs to thunderfuries to an atiesh and a corrupted ashbringer. Shit, now I'm going to have to dig through my screenshots... again.
---
I'll be at my brother from another mother's place for a bit to help them after a nearby robbery she helped prevent. So I be finishing fire emblem 3 heroes. Good time killer and spending time with loved ones before I abandon these peasants.
---
weeb flex, but okay
---
Yes it's the only thing that soothes the pain of waiting
---
ah okay. now i get it. thanks.
---
tbh its sort of embarasing now im in a pretty organised guild and i s9me times talk about old stories
---
i sort of cringe because half these guys have cleared everything many times recently on pservers 
---
i dont care though im here to have a blast and enjoy the memories
---
i picked a new class , new role , and avoided pservers just so i can be as crap starting out as possible 
---
did a lot of practice this week but i dont think it should ruin anything for me i would have been a bit more shit than i wanted to look
---
I think you'll find that num pad 9 is the interrupt.
---
Hmm ok thx. Wanna Go alchi herb... So you say i kinda need enchant?
---
Seriously, fighting against people on the Classic General forums is ridiculous. A lot of people from retail are definitely moving into Classic now that it's close and are advocating for small changes and easier stuff.
---
Zero, I have planned to play Warlock as it is my most played class and still playing it.
---
Dude stfu, you read the title like everyone else. It takes no time out of your day to skip over it.
---
Forsaken priest for me!

Do people realize boomers are all literally like 60 years old +?  People use boomer to just mean "old people" now.

70 enchanting for GMW.
---
58 cloth for LMW, and about 200 cloth for 70 enchanting, which is not too bad. This number also drops ~6 cloth per random green drop. It's not too bad.
---
Drive fast, eat ass. Fool proof tactic.

this is like the first rule of the internet, if you went into a AOL chat room and someone said 20/f/CA its a dude and if it said 15/F/CA its a fbi agent.

---
TF threat was heavily nerfed before anyone got into BT. Anyone still using it at that point was clueless.
---
who cares
---
They used a TINY team.... Did you read anything about it?
---
Just because it was difficult doesnt mean it was expensive.  ALL of the assets are there already...
---
I have bought 6 months subscription for this and now they hand it out for free? REEEEEEE
---
There's one built into the game. Go talk to an inn keeper
---
"BREAK ADDONS BLIZZARD NOW" or some bullshit about mafias. Basically play my way or your "breaking the spirit of vanilla". AKA Retail is satan and anyone close to its likeness should burn.   
---
The spirit of vanilla is enjoying your adventure, yet people are foaming at the mouth.
---
If this is what we're complaining about now then I think we're okay.
---
I think there's a disconnect rule where if you get DCD you have about 5 minutes to get back online or your spot is given to someone else.
---
Stop reading when you said "retail noobs" because god forbid they love the same game as you. They are just as happy as you to to be going back home to Classic.
---
And retail player that enjoy bfa alot wont even play classic.
---
I was really disappointed during the stress test to see people advertising for people in all greens. The elitism was already starting. Most of the groups I ran with were not at all like that, but that element is definitely going to try to assert itself in Classic.
---
Un'Goro Crater. The flora and fauna, the anticipation of knowing Devilsaurs are around, and there might be an opposing faction player running around. Awesome
---
Man, you should have some something funny. Like have the same design but where the release date is, have the queue wait time! That would have been great! Nice work nonetheless!

Except for a handful of BoP recipes, no other profession has much a direct on PvP like Engineering.  You basically get a free stun/cc via the bombs.
---
Level as Tailoring/Mining and save up ore on bank alts to switch to Eng at Lv60
---
Wahhhhh
---
Nah. I'm super hyped.
---
&gt;	It pushes people away from behaving well, joining a guild, developing friendships with other humans etc
---
In what way? How on earth could an addon that lets you find groups make people “not behave well”??
---
&gt;	It’s a fundamental part of the classic experience that was stripped away over time where you now have the ridiculous “four players appear, then disappear in a puff of smoke” that you have in retail
---
This is nothing but a slippery slope fallacy and even if it wasn’t it’s still a bad argument.
---
“People shouldn’t have the convienence of an addon because 14 years after vanilla release the game sucked” like seriously?
---
&gt;	Many long term players like me have watched the slow death of the game, transforming from one experience into a very different experience. The whole point of classic is to go back to that original experience
---
And the original experience had LFG addons...
---
Should we also not be able to use discord? 
---
Should we disable all addons? Since addons make the game boring and everyone knows that if you allow 1 addon before you know it classic wow is going to get the retail patch to be the exact same game right?
---
&gt;	Again, if you want these capabilities why not just play retail? It is the logical endpoint of all of these little qol changes added together. Why not just let classic be classic?
---
Because I want to play vanilla? Because I liked literally every aspect about vanilla? ***including the lfg addon I used?***
---
lmao this has to be some shitty copy pasta or something, reminds me of the rick and morty one, get of your fucking high horse you retard.

Used the g15 for many years until i decided to get a shiny one with rgbs and what not :D

That's a ok rule of they pull threat on something other than the focus-fire target.  If you let someone pull threat on the focus target and you refuse to tank it, you're not doing your job!

Engineering is huge for PVP, it can help you win a lot of 1v1s. Is it a must have? No. Is it extremely useful? Yes. 
---
PVE I'd avoid engineering as a mage completely.
---
Only once. Thought about being a Rogue again like I was in classic. Decided to go Shaman to heal our group.
---
Must be running sunken temple then? :P
---
Youtube's copyright woes are also due to that, I believe.
---
I was only talking about the decision to add realms before launch. Time-wise only. Not what they are doing besides that. Or what have they done before that.
---
I think there's a component of neurodivergence to it, but mods don't like me saying that.
---
Can someone explain to me what just happened?
---
I hit 10 with full looms and mount in about 20 minutes last week. It was a joke.
---
Because it's delicious.

Basically, during the beta, people were upset because blizzard's new server batch timer is extremely narrow. Back in the day, due to limited technology, they were much wider. The main takeaway from this is that during PvP, there were times where a blind and a polymorph would go off at the exact same time, stunning both people. 
---
Blizz heard about this, and, bless their hearts, tried to reproduce this aspect of the game. However, by doing so, some would say they *over*replicated it. Now, the batch window is much higher than what people are used to, which does funny things to even the time it takes to pick up loot from bodies. In the case of AoE and Blizzard, mobs running through blizzard (when the player has Improved Blizzard specced) go significantly further into the blizzard than they should; it takes a second for the snare to catch, thus reducing the amount of time they are in the AoE, and making them get closer to you, quicker.
---
This was over a month or so ago, and I haven't heard anything since. I'm wondering if the warts and all batch system is still around, or of blizzard has trimmed it down a bit.
---
New icons: actually looks like the race.
---
.... no it won't. I'm going to laugh when all these eve hardcores try to come and "take over" LOL. This subreddit alone has more active members to make these "coilations" crumble under sheer force. If you think people will just sit around to elitest neckbeards 24/7 camping a mob in WoW; then you clearly never played this game and are drastically misinformed.
---
90% of the community won't care and the other 10% that do will STILL out number the amount of these sad little "goon" gold farmers lol.. go back to your stupid space game with that nonsense.
---
Otherwise, my friends and I look forward to camping you and all of your mobs in the crater.
---
Hunter weapon.
---
Not at all. Warrior threat issues only really start kicking in when you're dealing with raid geared and buffed and consumabed dps going balls out.
---
I find it pretty fun.
---
What the other guy said, I've played somewhat seriously on 4 servers, and I never once even heard of these add-ons until very recently.  I'd assume they'd exist in some capacity, but no one was talking about them / saying to use them. From what I've seen, they just look stupid.
---
I have literally every single ability keybinded. Even apply poisons. But I do not have F bound to anything. Perhaps I should reconsider my existence.
---
If the horde is all adults then why do you guys act like 13 year olds?
---
I'm honestly so excited that teenagers are going to be trying this out. I thought it would just be a bunch of boomers so this is dope. I started playing in 2008 when I was 15 and in 9th grade so this kills me with the nostalgia lmao
---
Addons that do not in any way automate gameplay. 
---
Only addons that should be allowed are things that clean up the UI or alter it in such a way that makes information more easily understood or makes the gameplay more comfortable/optimal.
---
Tbh i don't see a problem with the add-on. People who do won't be forced to use it, just like the people who don't use boss timers or raid frames or keyboard binds. Play how you like.
---
Hey! I'm interested in playing mage for classic and am most excited about raiding. Since I'm not able to play hardcore and put super much time in, I'm worried that I won't have time to compete with other mages since this class seem to be one of (if not the most) populated class judging from various polls on this subreddit, private server stats etc. Do you think mage will have a relatively hard time finding raid/dungeon groups in general as compared to some other classes? I just don't want to relive my retail vanilla experience with my rogue where I felt the class was so overpopulated that rerolling a different class felt like a breeze compared to gearing up.
---
can you drop a link for the Addon that you tried that works please?
---
Did you know that some package delivery services allow their drivers to expense parking tickets they get while working? The companies have determined that it’s cheaper to just pay the parking ticket in metropolitan areas rather than spending more time looking for a parking space and/or having to pay for parking.
---
&gt; Just like here on reddit, they’re the vocal majority. **On** [r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/) **subreddit, Horde players mass report Alliance-flavoured posts to get them auto-removed.** [proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowmeta/comments/ak067u/is_hiding_posts_without_any_warningreason_an/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
What a load of bullshit.
---
1. That "proof" is **YOUR OWN POST** complaining about **YOUR OWN MEME** that was removed.
---
2. The meme is bad and deserved to be removed, since all it did was bash Horde players for supposedly complaining about Alliance players.
---
LFG chat is now global. If they want to kick you to fill they'll do it without this tool. They don't need this tool to fill a dungeon. Dungeon filling won't be as easy as just kicking someone. The person that fills still needs to travel to the dungeon. This doesn't insta teleport them into the dungeon.
---
&gt; Yeah if it auto-invites I'm not a fan of that personally.
---
Yeah if it auto-invites I'm not a fan of that personally.  I just want something like Call to Arms again.  Give me a nice organized list of ppl looking for groups that I can click on and /w the person to see if a slot is still available.
---
Pff, you really think I would that pathe.. ok yes, yes I have.
---
Ah yes, this is of course completely black and white

I played every single stress test. Please in release make a video of you fighting two murlocs at once over there at level 8-9.  And you just described fighting one Murloc.
---
Astute argument. But wouldn’t they run to Northshire Valley then?
---
Has anyone else who's played both sides experienced only reasonable frustration when killed by a Horde, but feel a *deep-seated internal rage* when killed by an alliance? I say this as someone who played alliance 95%. It's like they just think they're better than you. If they throw in a /laugh it really sends me over the edge. Female Night Elves in particular.
---
Aight, that makes me feel better at least

You could always play a little bit of Diablo 2 ... that's what I've been doing the last year or so.

Blizzard stated that medium servers have more ppl than overcrowded servers back in 2006,so a high server nowdays will be more than overcrowded.
---
Can we not muddy the beautiful waters of classic with shitty pepe memes that have become a symbol for bigots?
---
This might not be an issue, just read on another thread that there will be black bars in the menu and character creation screen but when you log into any character the game will fill the screen, as long as the resolution matches your monitor you should be fine 😊
---
Miss any sort of collection quests, do kill quests if you are in groups, get to 15 ASAP to start dungeon farming for the missed loot.
---
I have a launch group on Horde, so maybe 14 is ok for us. If we can dodge early Barrens issues, that'd be great. At some point in time though, we'll have to do some quests, because of WC and RFK quests.

A surprisingly efficient and nice looking UI pack.
---
Do you have an add on manager for classic or did you install them all manually?  
---
All you need to do is unzip them into the interface &gt; addons folder, right? I swear it works only half the time.
---
Things will be ridiculously expensive for the 1st few weeks until the market settles.
---
lol! BIGNUMBAS. lets be real, if he isnt willing to play support with a 2hander he needs to reroll, thats a player issue not a class issue.
---
Mouse wheel is to adjust camera distance and for NOTHING ELSE.
---
What you've just said though-- "a huge part of the fun of classic was emergent game play", LFG via chat channels fostered immersion which in turn...fostered emergence. When you streamline modes of social interaction that are crucial to collaboration, you end up cutting immersion and gameplay is less emergent. I was on Vanilla back in the day--finding people was very conducive to quality of the dungeon run. Forget cutting corners yo. Keep it how it was.
---
Yeah its the same for the troll in the back of the cave in coldridge. It was 10 groups of 5 just fighting like hell for that tag, and every time people left plenty came to replace them.
---
I guess unpopular opinion but having something automated like the current day Group Finder would be a welcome addition imo. Just somewhere you can post your group and people can apply/look for it. You would still have to run out manually, and enter the dungeon. You wouldn't be automatically matched with and placed into the dungeon with people.
---
This would help alleviate the span in Trade (I guess people like the spam in trade?) but also allow you to find a group for a dungeon even if you are not sitting in the zone it's in or in a city. For example say you are questing in Redridge but wouldn't mind finding a group for Deadmines. It would be possible to find a group without stopping your questing progress.
---
Just my two cents.
---
PvE servers are litetally 60-70% Alliance.
---
Also, those polls aren't accurate. Herod's Discord is 46:54, a much better spread with double the population. 
---
Please, people need to remember that these polls are from reddit. The vast majority of people playing this game do not come to reddit or care about it. Blizzard said Herod would have queues of 10,000 or more. That means 15-20k people are already in the game. So 30,000 people total and only 3000 have polled. 90% of the population hasn't seen or touched that poll.
---
It's gonna be fine. EVERY PServer has skewed in favor of the Horde.
---
I hate to break it to you, but for most of us it has 0 redeeming qualities.  And this isn't coming from someone who has all the time in the world to play a game either, I normally only get like 3 hours a week tops out of gaming.  Most of us here want classic specifically because we want the game we love back, if we still enjoyed retail then this push for classic probably would have never happened... I'm not really sure how it's exhausting considering where you are right now... the majority of us hate retail, for good reason.  If you like it that's great!  Different strokes!
---
LOL, yeah, what do I know.  I didn't have \*videos\* to watch, I had to settle with our raiding MC 3-4 nights a week in one of the leading Horde guilds on Eldre'Thalas.  WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY KNOW THAT YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED (BETTER) FROM YOUTUBE?
---
You need numbers?  *Tanks* ***need*** *315 FR for Rag, Geddon, maybe Gole*.  That's not opinion.  The videos you're watching are from pservers where they're GUESSING at boss damage based on what they see. They say "oh, look Rag did 3000 on that hit, so we scale him to 3000 damage" *disregarding that the tank was wearing 315 FR to get that result*.
---
Skipping FR on the rest of the raid (eg the LBRS 81 buff) means healers will likely go oom covering incidental damage on those 3.  Getting at least the LBRS buff means your healers have a tiny bit of wiggle room and oh-shit resources.
---
Enjoy vanilla.  I hope you find the validation that you apparently so desperately need.  Maybe you can fight some strawmen while you're there, they seem to be surrounding you.
---
But i hit like a wet noodle in raids :(
---
You arent really ranting, you are spitting the truth haha
---
Welcome! Its never too late.
---
Started when i was 17 and now im 30
---
What about warriors rolling need on bows for the same reason lol.
---
Totally agree. You also need to be kind  and keep a good reputation with other players  to ensure that you'll get invited next time, further placing yourself into your role and the world.
---
He’s just a poor boy, from a poor family!

Spare him his life from this monstrosity!

B..b...but I thought we hated streamers, what's up with all these positive comments?
---
Why? Instead of having to look though this
---
Bignoobz: did somebody say [thunderfury, blessed blade of the windseeker]
---
Dpsurback: anal [dirk]
---
Healz: lfg sm
---
Chode: your mum gay
---
Tospot: pogz
---
Annoying: almond rule!!!1!!!!!
---
The addon just points out healz is looking to do the run I am looking to do. Without having to read all that other pointless shit.
---
I then wisper him and and asks if he wants to join.
---
It's almost like the addon doesnt change any of the social aspect at all
---
LFG tools will only be an inevitability when there is a critical mass of people using them.  If 90% of the playerbase is unaware, the functionality drops off sharply.
---
I can just imagine him sitting there, now 15 years older, fur starting to grey, wearing a smart 3-piece, with a pocket watch, a cute little pair of reading glasses, and a cup of tea... when all of a sudden there is a banging knock at the door. He looks outside and there is a pitchforks-and-torches mob of lowbie filth. With a sigh, he carefully removes the glasses and opens the glass weapon case above the mantle to dust off his trusty old axe. The furious bloodrage of battle is already bubbling up inside.
---
I have read that an enabled vSync can do this, but have no personal knowledge.
---
They also forget that whether you are ele, enhc, or resto, the basic rotation never really changes. You are still a shaman. I considered going full resto for the laughs, but after more serious consideration this enhc and resto build gives you the best tools avaliable while leveling.
---
While I think they deserve to get fucked for being disruptive, 100% this. If anything this will just cause more layers of dinos, lol.
---
Trying disabling any game overlays, worked for OP 😊
---
I think so too, it's also part of the reason why I could never stick to a  private server. The other important factor the is the timeframe Nost launched. Just shortly before that WoD launched and we all know how abyssmal that expac was and it didn't matter how good the raids were (they were some of the best), the launch and the overall lack of content caused more people than ever to quit retail in a short amount of time. Then in early 2015 Nost got a good PR boost on the internet, which is also why the launch was so incredibly packed. I truly wonder how many of the players who joined Nost in the launch month, quit WoD in the three months before that. I was one of those people. And I then quit Nost at the end of June when the FFXIV expansion launched.
---
My guess is, that the very least 30% of the the people who never played Vanilla will drop it in the first few weeks or months, mainly because it is very different compared to modern  WoW. And my guess is that it was also  a big reason why the 55% of the initial accounts on Nost quit within 3 months, in addition to the reason you mentioned.
---
This would be amazing, great idea
---
I have 3440x1440 as well, AW3418DW, you don't need to change aspect ratio, when you go ingame it is the entire ultrawide screen, only the character select/login screen has the black bars.
---
Youre rolling on Whitemane, aren't you?
---
This is absolutely undeniably completely true, and the primary reason I quit and deleted my characters when it was introduced in wrath. People were already using addons for it but the moment it was added in game the entire game became shit for me (although, it was only the combination of gearscore+LFG that created the casual toxic environment that WoW became)
---
Once. Only because I added a class though. I am leveling PvE with wife and PvP with friends. I decided to not do the same one on both and ended up with an new class.
---
You could do that in Cata once they nerfed everything.
---
This is the best title I've ever read on this subreddit
---
That didn't answer the question. 
---
Yes, because that way you don't fight two because two is harder than one
---
&lt;- Shadow priest.
---
F is for offensive cooldowns you donkey. E is for interrupt. R is for stuns.
---
The word you were looking for is 'wake', "I'm thinking about waking up around 5am to start playing around 6am."
---
You can also use 'get', "I'm thinking about getting up at 5am and playing at 6am." We use 'get' for everything now-a-days. It's used in place of so many verbs. People say it's not 'proper English', but their English is old and shitty and new English is cool.
---
I think they might be sister sites because the addon download page from warcrafttaver.com transferred me to the same download location that willitclassic.com uses
---
Switching between realms would defeat the purpose as you would be put in a queue when entering a realm.
---
Say no to *new* mtx. No paid for mounts or cosmetics or any bulshit!
---
Have you not heard of Skarm from Light's Hope? Look up his channel and tell me you still don't think feral tanks are viable. He's been MT for 90% of the bosses in vanilla with no issues. 
---
He also has a great discussion with another streamer going into detail about their pros/cons and viability if you have the time to listen to it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyWQlXtkuJ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyWQlXtkuJ0)
---
Every zone under level 30
---
Addons like that existed back in vanilla too.
---
Right but if I have the tool I can be looking for people who are in the zone as I'm in the dungeon before kicking. I can literally in a spam of 10 seconds open the app, open applications, check where the person is kick inv and they can run  in. 
---
It's not about teleporting. It's about making group reforming to easy which encourages people to do ot which encourages toxicity.
---
I’m confused isn’t this LFG addon just an addon that will spam the chat channels for the person? I did this back in vanilla by making a macro that read “/2 LFM need tank SM Library” and all I had to do was click the icon every few seconds when the chat scrolled upwards in trade chat
---
Oh great that’s perfect then, can’t wait to see how classic looks in ultrawide. Thanks a lot for the help I appreciate it!
---
We just want the game how it was, why is that so difficult to understand?
---
This is to true
---
I was thinking about that as well. AOE farming is supposed to be relatively bad in Classic, as opposed to pservers because of the way they do the server side ticks.  But it would be nice to have the option to do some AOE when the need arose.
---
Combat Swords will be better for a while. 
---
Seal Fate Daggers picks up steam after the first few raids, IIRC.
---
Wow you're talking sense, you don't belong here sir! This place is for arbitrary conjecture and conspiracy only, please see yourself out.
---
Agreed, the icon update was not needed. I do wish there were a toggle option in classic to use the new models/spell effects. The reason I quit retail was gameplay related, I thought the new models and spells were fine.
---
*Job's done.*
---
Retail is just so boring with new characters.  It's so fun easy and feels so unrewarding because of heirlooms.
---
That's a terrible argument. Sure it sounds like a smart pithy argument, but it's a false dichotomy. A more accurate comparison would be saying "Blizzard might as well allow a gold selling addon" or "Blizzard might as well allow gold selling spam".
---
You're just using something against the ToS, and suggesting Blizzard make it okay to do as a way to incite outrage, and make agreeing with that side of the argument impossible. In that regard, it's a decent arguing tactic, it just has nothing to do with the actual argument at hand, which is why it's terrible.
---
Yeah because addons developed and used on private servers without blizzard control is a good argument for this.
---
The only timezone that matters is the one that hosts the servers.
---
Julian date for the win.
---
&gt;I'd support banning them, gladly. I'd support banning all addons, actually. 
---
I'd support that too, actually.
---
&gt;But let's be real: Questie is not against the vanilla experience. I played vanilla and had carbonite and other addons for the same shit.
---
I guess that's the big issue, people had different experiences in vanilla. But if you look at what blizzard talks about in their recreating classic, their game design philosophy from behind the scenes, etc. I think you can make a guesstimation of what they intended.
---
Mankrik's wife wouldn't even be a meme if quest addons were widely used from the start. Though to be fair, I think in the early versions of Carbonite it didn't actually display her location.
---
Then again, there's quite a few quests like that. You don't get explicit directions where to find something and you're supposed to just explore...quest mods go against that whole experience / idea.

Back to my glory days, when there was only one true main tank.
---
Tbc was my favourite expansion and I have the best memories of WOW from that era, but you are 100% correct — the seeds of modern WoW were planted in TBC and it took years to realize their weaknesses.
---
- dailies 
---
- optimized “quest hubs”
---
- focus on harder raids at smaller sizes, versus bigger raids with room for error
---
They’re a lot like PVP servers except more guild events due to RP guilds being big on that. My only gripe with RPPVP servers is they’re typically non-competitive with PVE. But to me it’s because there’s another focus of almost every guild. Time that they spend RPing, another guild would be spending farming gold for raid or farming something.
---
Obviously not all guilds suffer from that but with so many guilds that try to do RP on top of other content, it does lose focus in other areas when you add RP to the mix
---
keep trying, you'll get there buddy

He mindcontrolled the level 60 elite npc, the npc has the warrior ability „cleave“. Cleave hits multiple players at once. Op npc + low gear enemy’s = dead in one hit
---
I'm a paladin, sharing is what we do.
---
It is far too pervasive for that. There is plenty of room to be horrible socially without a physiological disorder, hence why I posit that it is based more from a 'false positive' to other psychological systems that are otherwise in perfect working order. 
---
Also, people who truly have disorders should be handled more gently than people who should be fully capable of controlling themselves, but are just jackasses.
---

*Cudd’nt be any other way, cudd it?
---
Honestly. Then you’re not qualified to lead a group in Classic. 
---
And *it could be an accurate addon* is a theoretical. I could win a million dollars tomorrow too. The fact that I haven’t in the last 20+ years means it probably won’t happen. 
---
I have yet to see a sim tool that accurately sims tank and healer performance. Dps, sure. But healers and tanks are much more complex than that. So even if the item values were based on sims, that would only be accurate for one of three roles.
---
Oh, I'm quite regular. I cook and eat a wide variety of culinary delights and poop at 7am each day, like clockwork. These dishes are mostly chicken and veggies, I don't really foresee a major problem. ;)

I started his video “The Story of Warcraft” and it started at like the dawn of time with a Titans and a legion or something. That didn’t seem within the scope of how Warcraft one was described to me so I stopped. Deep lore stuff like that I wanna try and discover in game if possible.
---
i think each group should have a leeroy, to make things more authentic.
---

Thanks for the suggestion. Googled the name TSM and seems like a great addon. Will definitely use it.
---
Sure! Technically, I'm part of a mining association made up of... basically three people with a ton of other names slapped on so we could claim as much land as possible. The three people consist of me, my dad, and an old lady who can't mine but is a wizard with paperwork and networking.
---
So right now we have over 1300 acres of continuous mineral rights deep in the mountains but it's fairly well known from the Goldrush era. There's a couple old mining cities whose ruins are still easily identifiable as well as plenty of cabins, flumes, and all sorts of other goodies around. 
---
Right now we're working on getting full blown mining in, like what you see on shows like Goldrush and such, but since we're technically in a National Forest and there's so many historic things around us, we're working very carefully with the Forest Service and BLM to make sure everything goes right. We actually have our first heavy equipment coming in Sept 1 to do some test trenching in an area the old miners never hit (but they were finding lemon sized nuggets right below!).
---
For me personally, when I go out to just kick back and get some gold I do one of a few things. I can go sniping, which is just checking the creeks where I know gold tends to get stuck. After the Spring floods a lot of gold can get trapped in the same places and sometimes you get lucky and find a good amount with almost zero effort (besides getting wet). If I'm just more or less getting out there to hang in the woods, I'll do a little panning and try to find hot spots. 
---
If I want to get some gold, I have a tiny battery powered trommel and water pump. I set up a self-contained system so I'm not dumping anything back into the creek and I have permits to do test holes all over the place. Test holes aren't toooo big but if you find gold you're allowed to do cubic yards, as long as you cover up the last yard you did. Doing that for the whole weekend where you're actually focusing and trying to get it can usually net some good results (especially if you know where to do it).
---
We also have quite a few old shafts on our claims, two of which are VERY promising. One, the guy who owned it back in the Goldrush was the one who built the road 40-something miles into the mountains and laid railroad track at great expense... only to fall ill just before completion. He collapsed the entrance and died shortly after, never having worked it in earnest. 
---
This is all in some pretty gnarly territory, lots of the meanest critters around and you gotta go to some pretty... ill-advised locations, so it's kept people out for the most part. I mostly end up doing exploration and setting up markers but when I need money I can just go grab some out of the ground. It helps that this state is dirt cheap to live in, especially compared to my home state of Connecticut.
---
Depends on phase. No one will be buying off the AH at launch so high prices wont mean much. MC boe will be worth tons till guilds are 3 4 months into farming it.
---
Most importantly tho alot of people will post super super rare items for standard prices i bet. Like a miners cap for 50g its a shitty blue with bad stats.... and a .02% drop rate making it worth 10000g to a collector.
---
The point is in classic Warriors rely only on slow auto attacks in the beginning and heroic strike is terrible, they have no self heal or mobility so until later levels if you pull two mobs you need to run away and hamstring kite unlike other classes so yes warriors are a bit harder to level in the beginning which is why I’m sure there will be a huge drop off for warriors.
---
I'm not disagreeing that it does give added information.  I just don't see the point.  It's like might as well start asking for people to flask and consume for 5/10 man dungeons as well.  
---
But I see the other restrictions you'd be looking for if you're really being picky on invites... if that person has the item you're looking for.  I could care less if some guy is in shit greens, but if he has the Rend Mainhand, he's coming on my UBRS group.  That's more of a factor to me than just an item level equivalency score rated gear.
---
I mainly only considered mage since I've always had a "is the grass greener on the other side" type of deal since Vanilla.  
---
But who am I kidding, undead warlock until I die and rise again. Been one for 15 years, will be one for the coming 60.
---
I unzip the folder, then put the folders extracted into the Interface &gt; Addons folder. That's it. Then, on  the character selection screen, you need to open the Addons interface and make sure they're all loaded. Out of date addons will not load by default.
---
Lol? Gold generation is inexistent compared to Retail .
---
...or I played mostly during vanilla, when achievements weren't a thing.
---
Yes, unless you don't plan to be 60 before ZG patch.
---
If you need convincing then you dont belong...
---
I hope it’s not that bad, if I have to wait one more day after Monday I’m going to crawl into fetal position and bawl.
---
Maybe I'm just weird then because I'm in my guilds discord, the servers discord, and 3 different class discords. I feel like people can be apart of multiple communities, but if I find a good friendly player I'll add them to friends list. I don't intend to use the discord lfg much.
---
Not op but thanks!
---
Maybe like phase 6. Those prices are insane when most people don't have epic mounts.
---
Exactly this.
---
When BC was out I mained a warrior tank and loved the pace of keeping threat, marking the next pull as we finish our current pull, facing mobs away from the group, etc. I had so many little tips and tricks since warrior AOE wasn't great and mobs were easy to pull off of me. I would run heroics all day to help people get rep and attunements. 
---
It got to the point where 3 seconds after logging in I would be getting whispers if I was tanking, and could spend 3-4 hours running heroics without ever having to ask for a group. If the other 4 members were a guild and one new guy was messing things up, they would jump on him and straighten him out because they didn't want me to stop tanking for them. I miss those days of playing the game with the same strangers (non guildies) every day. And it was the same for me with healers, good healers I would add to my friends to fill out groups with someone competent, made the runs so much smoother.
---
since battlegrounds will be crossrealm i think it wont matter in terms of queue times. all the matters is how many other people are ranking at that time and how consistent you get the highest bracket
---
8 PvP realms, excluding 2 German, 1 French and 1 Russian.
---
Here is the funny thing...we're going to need 8 more, at least, for launch.
---
#YEP
---
Haha that would be awesome. Hopefully the VR scene mature enough to have that happen, along with a game that could support it. My setup is already fairly complicated to set up, I have a checklist I complete every time I start streaming. But hopefully one day in the future, I could feel my leg getting chomped by a Murloc.
---
argus was the worst part of legion lmao
---
Do Highway restrooms often charge you money to shit?
---
i'm just using it as an example to show that your argument doesn't really excuse the skelly nerf.
---
I was planning a retri paladin and this give me... retri paladin. It's meant to be boys.
---
Alliance players are unhinged scientologists with severe affluenza. Got it. 
---
That said, somehow I just know my friends will definitely go alliance.
---
Or you’re the rogue/ druid waiting for that person to add pull that murloc lol.
---
Buddy its a 40 man raid and from your class selection here i dont think you were gonna be hardcore to begin with 😂
---
How does blocking people on your server build community any better?  Isn’t it the point of vanilla to get to know them?
---
I think Blizzard breaking these addons is a good thing, but they aren’t LFR and never can be.  No addon can form groups with people you’ll never see again.  No addon will teleport you to a dungeon.  The mechanics of the game can’t be changed, so there isn’t an addon that will kill your experience.
---
These kind of addons are like dating apps.  Some people are very social and good at meeting people in their daily lives.  Some people really want to meet people but want to connect with people more easily.  It still takes effort.
---
The bigger problem is culture.  People reducing each other to a number (gear score) or (more commonly) reserving every item in a run is much worse IMO.  Be the change you want to see and invite scrub geared characters to your dungeon runs.  Accept multiple clothies in your run even though that spell power item is needed by all of you.  Graciously accept losing a roll and run the dungeon again later.
---
The point is the addon encourages people to be less inclusive and more toxic by making grouping and regrouping to easy encouraging people to play dungeons the way they do in retail. Kicking at first wipe and replacing instead of trying to figure the game out. It encourages people to be toxic by making the process faster and easier.
---
You cant say it doesnt make the process easier because then there would be no need for the addon.
---
You missed our on warlock healthstones and summoning portal and also druid rebirth, I’d say those are pretty big
---
Our guild of 70 is moving from Golemagg to Razorgore
---
Bear tanks are totally viable. They just take TONS of farming to take advantage of their strengths, and they can’t tank every fight.
---
For me my issue is I see a good number of Druids saying they’re going Feral at 60 because they heard it’s viable. But if I ask if they’re aware how much extra farming they’ll need to do they had no idea.
---
Bears are god tier tanks while leveling though. I’d take a feral Druid over a warrior while leveling any day
---
26-28
---
Hey, if those people wanted to be sure, they'd have looked it up. It's been public knowledge for a while, don't spoonfeed the lazy!

All I remember from paladins in vanilla is bubble+hearthstone.

I think it might be based on the "God I wish that were me" meme

You are one of the few who didn't know. This was publicly posted on the 10k+ upvote Dev AMA
---
Its literally still proof. 
---
If you’re a passionate horde player then you’ll obviously think a meme bashing you is bad. Get real buddy.
---
jajajaja.. hahahaha... ok... no.
---
seriously speaking, a lot of people defend LFR, so you have a lot of people who are going to keep playing retail. Many people enjoy history and how it evolves (for better or worse) so you have many people who will follow in rateil for the lore.
---
The two will continue to exist, because they point to two very different audiences.
---
It’s a joke....
---
Quality post, got a good chuckle
---
I'm interested in seeing the journey my friend
---
Act like you're 80 years old and just forget how to use technology outside of wow. Haha.
---
All the good locks I’ve chatted with, and pretty much most of the streamers I’ve watched seem to disagree.  I played a lock in BC and wrath, so I don’t have first hand experience with classic, but I’ve seen them all day they’re a tier A dps.
---
If blizzard wins, we win.
---
A and D are for strafing. T is an acceptable interrupt though, although I tend to use G.

Or just tell Blizz.

It’s like if Kermit and Yoda had a cringe baby.

We already had this discussion!
---
Once you make a hyperbolic silly statement right out of the gate, literally nothing else you say can be absorbed. You announce "Hey! Don't listen to anything else I have to say because I'm just making ridiculous outlandish statements!"

So unfortunately whatever point you were trying to make you immediately sabotaged =(
---
But you'll do better next time, I'm 100% positive.

Looks like a type waterfowl to me.

Priest is leagues above druid. All 3 specs of druid lacked something in vanilla. Priest is the best healer in game.
---
I've buckled myself into my seat on this hypetrain. I'm so excited I am having to find other things to do for time to go by. A few successful things I've found so far:
---
1. Mess around on the overwatch roleque beta
---
2. Play minecraft
---
3. Clean and prep any launch day festivities I have planned. 
---
With or without a distraction, these last few days are going to be difficult.
---
Yeah, get them hooked while they're still young and impressionable.
---
I haven't played this game in a "full time" sense since TBC.  I just don't see how this is any different than a chat parse.  But whatever, I'm going to be doing full guild runs in dungeons for the most part anyway, so I won't need a system like this.  Either that or I'm just going to LFG on the server discord when I need a sub.
---
My point was that it wasn't proof of anything because personal experience just doesn't count as proof, kinda like:
---
&gt;ive seen countless alliance bashing posts that stay up whereas anything horde bashing gets removed. 
---
This ^.
---
Actually record the amount of anti-horde and anti-alliance posts being removed and compare the results. Then have it cross examined by someone else.
---
Holy shit, uninstall.
---
Its on the west side of eastern kingdoms even.
---
His corn spews rainbows, gnomes and pots of gold.
---
Combined with the boring Malfurion x Tyrande drama, I think the night elves have known the greatest downfall of all the races. They were much more interesting in Warcraft 3 and Vanilla.
---
No, stay on your own containment server.
---
Who installs addons this way?
---
No point in elemental precision!?
---
Internet has many sites with guides and videos about the whole ordeal. Keep your eyes open during dungeons when you are dps and you will learn! :)
---
Thanks
---
Agreed, I'm hoping to hit 60 in a few months and join a guide with MC on farm.
---
Hah, yeah, but at least we aren't like those idiots, right?
---
Circle jerk continues to the left, thanks.
---
Paladin - bubble
---
wow...didn't think it's that bad...
---
Embrace the Boom.
---
Dynamic spawns and layering. Last stress test showed they had this down to a science. Kobolds were spawning around me as fast as I could kill them.
---
Shaman's can't tank molten core, i'll tell you that. Neither can paladins, but bears absolutely can.
---
it's HARD to find tanks in classic. People won't be picky about bears, i promise.
---
People have been using damage meters/parsers since the EQ days. It isn't going to stop.
---
However, the good news is, if you run into people that ruin your runs because they do silly things in the name of parsing you can just not group with those people again. That's the beauty of grouping with people on your server, if you're known as a jerk or frequently waste people's time, you will be ostracized.
---
Hopefully he wasnt driving
---
Well I wouldn’t say it’s because we have more practice in bear while leveling, but Warriors are extremely gear dependent. Yes them leveling in fury/arms and we are basically in our tank spec anyway while leveling is a factor, but our AOE threat generation is just tons higher, mainly due to Pre-hot pulls, also making you a lot easier to heal to healer could help DPS or you just have no downtime, and finally Druid just isn’t that gear dependent. Get leather gear with Stam and you’re golden

Only if they decurse.

mistakes were made

you still have to talk to them. you still have to communicate. 5 minute dungeons arent a thing in classic, theres no insta teleport once the group is formed. if you get ass hats in your group, people remember them. these people dont get it. there is no more disposable groups in classic. you get a reputation if you dont act right.

My point was that it wasn't even really against ToS then from what I can recall. He is making the assumption it was because of some arbitrary limitation in place at the time.

2 days ago i had a dream that i was a warlock standing upon a cliff overlooking a sea of undead casting rain of fire. last night i just had a dream about regenerating zombies.

Assuming you can muster enough players to make it worth trying to fight them, sure. Feel like everyone on this sub is some wannabe tough guy that thinks their mere presence in a zone sends people trembling.

You need to make a new account on the European blizzard website

Guess you think this addon enables crossrealm, dumbdown content and teleports to dungeon.
---
This aint no dungeon finder, its a group finder. Just like /3 is, might aswell ban /3!!!11
---
Fuck rping, that stuff is weird.
---
What about ones that automatically use the most efficient lower-level version of a skill to save mana.
---
why are you guys playing with your girlfriend? like, they're noobs and will make you fall behind!
---
The greatest thing about classic/vanilla was the community. High pop = better guilds (that tend to be larger, more organized), more folks to form PUGs, better PVP (if you’re into that).
---
I don’t get why some of you care so much in regards to what addons other players use. This new McGuffin that people are going crazy over this week won’t kill Classic.
---
For warlock I'm not sure I would call summoning a perk. What ends up happening is people sit and wait for you to run to the dungeon while they quest, check AH or something. Even if it requires 3 people to do it, very often you will just have 1 dude who came to the dungeon to help summon even if you repeatably asked. People ignore and hope someone else in the group runs. If no warlock everyone would have started to get to the dungeon right away.
---

The whole purpose of using the boat in the first place was to get the ladies nice and tipsy top side, so we can take them to a nice comfortable place below deck, and you know, they can't refuse...because of the implication.

You mean switch to shadowform then /laugh?
---
&gt;You will never find one because only garbage players never used any addons. Now we know the type of people you associated with and why your point of view is so narrow and flawed.
---
I used addons since the start, but okay.
---
&gt;Also, every person raiding in my guild was required to have DBM.
---
DBM wasn't even a thing in vanilla, you had a raid called CTframes and CTassist I think--but they didn't have nowhere near the functionality of DBM.
---
So your response to why I can't take you seriously is to use more hyperbole lmao.
---
Never change bud! Thanks for brightening my morning.

Just say he's left handed? :P

That was my plan, then succumbed with the bullshit reasoning of, "ILL JUST PLAY SOME BFA IN THE MEANTIME".

Just killing mobs for a quest... Invite.  
---
Gathering 10x paws, wings, candles, ect... invite will only happen occasionally.  
---
Single drop quest mobs remains, head, letter, ect... invite.  
---
Also if leveling with friends during quests that you have gather 10 paws. If you get all of the drops you need switch to free for all loot so they can hopefully finish faster.
---
I will start as an undead priest on golemagg

I can’t wait to fear horde off the boat right before the loading screen

By 1.12 he doesn't deal shadow damage
---
Do this. Get NS and then put the rest into feral. This let's you go the NS/HOTW build by 60, so you can still play solo, or fill other roles for the 60 dungeon/gold grind for your mount.
---
Got a Sentry Cloak on my 28 Warrior in Gnomer. Sold it for 100 gold. Most gold I’ve ever made at once up to that point.

Because me the healer managed to get aggro from healing everyone who almost died to the mobs the paladin didn't have aggro on causing the wipe :)

why isn't a server called gamon? is it a retail server already or what?

You will get the following answers:

1) Low/Medium pops will die in the future!
---
2) Low/Medium pops are more than High pops in the past they’ll be fine!
---
We don’t know who is right as the future is not confirmed.
---
Really hope someone at blizz is seeing this and other fan attempts to advertise on their behalf. I can’t wait to see all servers full and possibly crashing from launch day surge. Gonna make a splash on the entire modern MMO market.
---
Please quote where I said you can pull 30 things in retail and not die. I leveled to 120 on the first day of bfa launch. BFA leveling is much easier though. You can easily pull 2-3 and keep going without eating or drinking. They are different games but classic wow leveling is definitely more punishing.
---
Undead Warlock
---
or gnome anything
---
Sure, I can see why you'd say it is a misinterpretation and I kinda agree. Problem is unless they make add-ons unable to read chat, which is not happening, I don't think they can break this one. Take this with a grain of salt as I've never used it so it could use other APIs that could be removed and I don't know about.
---
Most standard dude is probably human rogue or warrior.
---
I recall something about this. Wasn't there an expanded ignore list addon or something?
---
Bingo, they block addons from being able to interact with chat they break basically every addon most of these classic purists would be using as well (threat metwrs/dps meters)
---
Because there was a massive proportion of people that just didn't bother with raiding or even getting to 60. Taking it seriously implied you got to 60 and raided beyond MC. Add-ons in that bracket were absolutely used.
---
I agree that some add-ons do take away from what the game should be about, such as the LFG Tool and perhaps Quest Helper. However, QoL add-ons are great, as a developer can only do so much - allowing add-ons on a more basic level takes a lot of work load away from the developers, and enables them to spend resources elsewhere (fixing bugs, content, etc etc).
---
Man, what I wouldn't give to have that quest givers armor set!
---
Playing on a low pop has the benefit of less contested stuff like harvesting nodes, world bosses, etc.
---
High pop - easier to find guilds, easier to find groups, more stuff on AH, easier to sell on AH, better prices on AH, easier to get help with quests, and probably several other things.
---
Err priest: never worry about health/Mana during leveling
---
North is on the Stelagg discord as verified.
---
Agreed, lets get this Addon taken down.
---
Thanks. Not sure about the res. Maybe I didn’t upload the highest quality last time around.
---
Locks don't scale any better with high end gear than the other dpsers. Warrior scaling is off the charts, rogue scaling is very good, and mage fire talents are amazing. Mages get +6% hit, +30% threat reduction, ignite is the stone cold nuts, and Imp Scorch matches Shadow Vulnerability without having to bring along a mediocre dpser. Fireball itself scales better than SB thanks to its 3.5 sec cast time.
---
I think it does affect the game as well. Corpse piles can communicate the action on the land to other players. If you walk past a pile of bones you get an idea that something went down there. Like, it's a hot zone. Maybe you'll be on alert more in that area or maybe you'll remember that stuff can happen there and you might keep it in mind for future pvp endeavors. If nothing else, at least it's a testament to a living world.
---
If I came to Menethil harbor and saw piles of bones, my rogue alert would start beeping and I would run to the flight master or boat a lot faster than otherwise. The greys would get vendored in another town and perhaps I'd manage to evade the rogue.
---
none of us are proponents of lfg we're just tired of hearing the rest of you bitch and whine about it
---
Frost mana efficiency relies on Frost Channeling talent. Fire tree also has a mana efficiency talent (Master of Elements), but that one relies on critical strikes.
---
It's my spec and it's not garbage.
---
1. Ice Shards is terrible- you spend 5 talents points to get 33% more dmg to cone when it crits. Yes, the tooltip is misleading, but it increases the bonus 50% damage to a bonus of 100% damage. So instead of doing half more on a crit you'll do double. 200/150 = 33% more damage on a crit.
---
Compare that with 3 talent points in imp COC for 35% all the time- even if you were ALWAYS shattering with cone and had 10% crit from gear your effective damage increase from 5 points of ice shards would be 21.5%, for FIVE TALENT POINTS.
---
2. Burning soul is super overrated. You shouldn't be taking pushback as the spec DESIGNED to pump instant casts- 2 points into fireblast actually means you'll be pumping more instant damage, being more mobile, and being able to avoid pushback naturally as a result.
---
3. A lot of these choices can be up to taste as well, I run 2/3 scorch because it's usually enough for how I play and I get to run 1 point in improved fire ward because you default to fire ward in most cases because of its effectiveness against engineering items, and reflecting the occasional sapper is downright hilarious. You can run less points in improved cone of cold as well- frost is mostly for the utility and when I get a little more gear I shift more points out so I can get a point or two of firepower which does a lot at higher spellpower.

its not that bad at all. its acutally pretty damn nifty. espeically if you did a bunch of dungeon running before you had that addon. like me, in vanilla.
---
What are you playing this time around ?
---
I'd also add, because it hasn't been touched on much in this thread.. It's equal parts how weak Ret is and how strong Holy is that gives it it' reputation. Healers are obviously always in demand, and we know that, but the DPS hybrids that are well accepted have one common thread.. 
---
They have utility unique to the spec. 
---
Ret doesn't do anything a Holy Paladin couldn't while being more competitive in its role. Where as say, a Shadow Priest provides Shadow Weaving, and a Feral Druid provides Leader of the Pack. Boomkin is really the outlier to this for two reasons. 1. Oomkin. They simply aren't very functional as a class.. and 2. The 3% spell crit is simply just the spell variation of the 3% physical crit. So a Boomkin can just go feral, do better damage, and provide the same utility. 
---
Ret simply doesn't have any unique utility that doesn't benefit themselves. Sanc aura is pointless as no other 'dps' is focused on Holy damage, and they get no unique blessings. With IMP Blessing of Might being in the beginning of the tree where a Holy pally has access to. 
---
With that said, coming full circle.. 
---
&gt; or is it possible to play a ret pally and do well in raids?
---
You're never going to top the charts, and demand for you is going to be exceptionally low.. but in 2019 DPS numbers aren't likely going to be the reason guilds are wiping. So if you do try to raid as Ret, and a guild allows you to.. Expect to be rather low on loot priority, as well as likely having to fill a 'support' role of say the Nightfall wielder.
---
Yeah, i didn't mean for that to come off as confrontational against you, i did realize you weren't the person i was replying to originally, its just annoying seeing people here spamming all this nonsense, when we have so many new people coming in and getting info about classic from these kinds of threads.

It does look awesome though.  Good way to get some cardio in.

reconsidering my leveling route, ranting about how i want to play and consider to switch to a lower pop server
---
True, I quite like Mograine and Razorgore! 
---
My guild's considering relocating from Gehennas since that's full as well now.
---
Yeah, I would move to a less populated realm but my IRL friends and family are split 50/50 on whether to stay or leave Whitemane. Half care about their name reservations, the other half don't. So, we're sticking with Whitemane. We were some of the first people to create character there, back when it was low/medium on day 1 of name reservations lol.
---
With or without that mechanism, solo AoE grinding is NOT efficient, unless you have more mage friends with you.

Yeah, it sucks! 18 macro's are probably too niche :( Maybe you'd be able to find one second hand, though.

That might be true. I figured it was the same as TBC (mounting cancels the aura but not GW).

Got the same problem tomorrow, did this to fix it:
---
1) Go to the game folder where your World of Warcraft setup package is stored.
---
2) Right click on your game’s application wow.exe file, and select Properties.
---

Everyone fortold the prophecy when they regurgitated the line, “The only thing that will kill WoW, is WoW itself.”
---
Not false at all. I've lived the same thing plenty of times.
---
Those two couldn't be more likeable, even if they didn't create classic wow.
---
Would love to see this also. ALL THE HEATMAPS!
---
I do get it, I am anxiously waiting for TBC and WotLK so all this nochanges nonsense doesn't matter to me. There are people who want classic to succeed so they get to play their favorite expansion again in the future.
---
Trust me, a lot of players will still buy gold in classic either by transfering it from bfa through other players or just straight  up buy it from sketchy websites and get their credit card info stolen
---
Mage is a dominating class with great CC and utilities, excellent at both pvp and pve, fast leveling, and the one and only class that can AoE. The down side is that because of these benefits, there will be an excessive amount of mages, a dungeon group may have two and a 40-man raid may have 6-8, no kidding. Therefore you will face a lot of competition and it will be very hard for you to gear up.
---
I be more concerned about 90% population drop off after hype is over, wander what servers will survive.
---
If I were you I roll on highest pop sever, if you plan to progress your character in resnable amount of time.
---
I’m just blind, mb! I’d go with undead mage, with enchanting and tailoring.
---
What's the grizzly guild?
---
I love how unique all the classes are with what they can do in pvp. I'm so pumped for classic!
---
Basicly any class early on is easy to play with 1 hand other than the hunter just do to ranging. Go pally or warrior depending on if you are playon Alliance or Horde.
---
Blizz said in an AMA their plan is to simply activate the Enter World button. Since the servers are already up.
---
What a nerd
---
Perfect opportunity worse time!
---
I'm a total noob but I think it'll be a challenge

It’s this kind of attitude though that slowly killed retail WoW. People said the same things when LFG in game was introduced, when LFR was introduced, titanforging, etc. Look where we are now.
---
People complain because they know these small things can ruin the whole experience because even if you say, “if you don’t like it don’t use it”, that’s not possible when if majority of players are using it, the whole community is forced to use it. Ion said this exact same thing during the WoW Classic panel at last Blizzcon when it came to addon’s
---
Play what you want to play, man. Enh shamans have plenty of utility for groups as long as you know how to cycle totems. Some "hardcore" guilds may ignore you, but there will be plenty of groups happy to have you. Too much time will be put into your character to play something you dont enjoy!
---
Leather worker armor patches would like a word.
---
w..warlock? :')
---
I dont know it it was a thing in vanilla, but i remember in tbc there was LFG tool, where you can list yourself that you want to do a dungeon, but... noone used it.
---
oh thanks!
---
&gt; I am sorry that you don't get it. 
---
Fucking yuck.
---
Seems fine to run deadmines with. You won't ask much more info spamming chat.
---
Get a mouse with 24 buttons then key bind the very thing.
---
It could swing either way, it’s too early to make a case for any scenario. You should wait it out, check stats and hope for the best.
---
STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION
---
Player Skeletons are still in the game, just limited to 1 per player.
---
Reminds me of the crying Star Wars guy!
---
&gt; just as good as Legion
---
Ehh... Legion sucked fat fucking donkey dick.
---
No... you can develop your own addon and not publish it anywhere. Nothing requires it to be open source.
---
The question asked for gender, not sex
---
&gt;Pretty sure they made those NPCs immune to mind control during vanilla so this will be impossible in classic.
---
They did, but I can't remember at what patch.
---
How long are you one handed for? You can play any class with just clicking your spells and what not. It won't be ideal, but if you're just leveling it's fine. Even in dungeons you'll be fine as long as you're dps. You'll 100% die in any pvp situation, but if it's just a couple of weeks you can get to mid 20's or early 30's without going into zones that are heavily contested.
---
I never said anything about 5-mans.
---
And as for any other class/role, a "fucking great" Druid will do better than a "just okay" Warrior, but a "fucking great" Warrior will obviously do better than a "just okay" Druid.
---
It's not as much about the class as it is about who plays them, and how.
---
That said, there are obviously encounters where Druid tanking is much harder or nearly impossible, or at least require the healers to adapt their healing based on what class is tanking.
---
I just hate how a lot of people seem to assume that because Warrior is the best (which is a fact I'm not arguing against), it means other tanks can't get the job done at all, when there's very few encounters where Druids are literally worthless and the good thing is a Druid who mains Bear form can always go Cat form for those few encounters they likely won't be trusted to tank.
---
Play a hunter, PvP server will get frustrating at later levels if you can’t play well with two hands, don’t over-exert your arm / hand so that you don’t cause permanent damage.
---
Lmao these nerds will be banned so fast.
---
In the same boat as you, I love Hunter. I got my rogue to 65 in tbc and never touched her again. I just don’t like energy for some reason. Monks feral druids just can’t do it lol.
---
Got some news for you buddy. 😶
---
You literally just said you quit playing 10 years ago and just recently resubbed.
---
So how were you playing in cataclysm and legion? I detect so much awkward lying going on here
---
Fly ? Vanilla? My dear son. You are not prepared.
---
That's what I'm considering about Bigglesworth... I TOTALLY want to roll on that server now.
---
I am coming back solo, I went to one of the discords for one server and it was not a good experience, maybe that's my problem who knows.
---
But intend to be open to guilds and make friends along the way, hopefully by the time I am ready to raid I will have found a guild, if not I was PuG and eventually find a group that clicks with me.
---
What?  No character boost package?
---
What fact/data are you using to say that they have underestimated Classic? Due to the low amount of servers that they keep expanding on? If so, I don't think that's underestimating anything, I think that's a well executed strategy that makes sense from a business perspective but annoying and frustrating from a customer/player perspective.
---
Do you want them to also limit your connection to the servers to replicate the god awful internet from 2006?
---
It will follow the same launch day surge, rapid decline, and stabilization that all MMOs have followed (including WoW expansions) for the past decade.
---
The online market is too diverse and has too many games battling for mind/market share for one game to become as sticky as the early 00's MMOs did.
---
Pally, go pally
---
mage would be pretty easy, you just press frostbolt 90% of the time
---
Make a US starter account
---
Which starting area do we think will be the least crowded? Undead maybe?
---
Cool story.
---
It takes 20 seconds and half a brain to inspect someone. 
---
Invite the wrong people and you’ll spend hours wiping. 
---
Cool story though. Clearly those weren’t guild groups. Or people that you already knew were competent. Clearly.
---
[To new players: we're done for, but you still have a chance to live](https://media3.giphy.com/media/fbbL8ApME14pG/giphy.gif)
---
So most classes should be enjoyable, even 1 handed for a long time after launch. The only issues I could see are movement demands in some fights and pretty much 100% of pvp. I’d go to a normal server at least until you recover.

Like someone said, collect healing gear as you level so that you have a set to switch into. That’s really all there is to it.

Pre-raid BIS for hunters is dal-rend set. Rolling on it is going to make you some enemies though.

Wasn't Stan's character in the episode named "lovestospooge"? I recall the devs coming to Stan's house and looking for "a great night, by the name of 'lovestospooge'". Stan's dad replies that it's his son's character in warcraft.

---
Until they get banned I guess, but yeah that would be annoying.
---
Get on my second account and play an alt on a low pop server.
---
Not sure what to tell you. Unless you're into the druid class fantasy for other reasons, the class just doesn't come with as powerful/versatile a toolkit for pure healing as priest or paladin, and you will have a single res with a long CD.
---
If you're aware of that and would still want to go for druid, I'm sure your skill can sufficiently carry you through 5-man dungeons.

The complaints about this add on make zero sense. This just allows you to continue playing the game instead of sitting in a capital sitting spamming chat for a group. It's not Dungeon Finder.
---
Ah yes, a man of culture. I expect to see you on Grobbulus at launch as well then.
---
Are your fingers free?
---
I have to say, I've been playing on private servers for the last couple of years, I have never once heard the term "item level".
---
Do you think Classic will have that many players?
---
I don't play since pandaria, but I can hardly see the same amount of people that were online at expansion releases getting into classic.
---
An earth elemental 1h mace with flat mana reduction to offensive spell costs, and a hefty serving of arcane and nature damage. Make all them ele shammies and moonkins real happy.
---
Blizzard and Reddit are based in the US, as are most users in English-dominated forums such as r/classic. No one thinks Europe doesn't exist, but for a majority of people in these threads, Classic arrives on the 26th. 
---
It's not about think everything revolves around us, it's about knowing we tend to be the majority in the online platforms that most of us frequent. You wouldn't catch most Americans speaking this way on r/de or a European MMO.
---
I assure it's a minority. I played on a few of the servers that shall not be named. Most people still get stuck in MC for 3 hours and wipe all day in BWL. Was in a ZG that lasted 7 hours once. Jesus was that painful. Point being it's not as many as it sounds like.

BfA was the battle for literal azeroth. The game itself. It wasnt about horde and alliance vs azurite or whatever bullshit live has you gather now. BfA was blizzard vs players, a fight to keep live alive. And the battle was lost.

"Grossly over the hit cap" just stop dude. I am friends with the guy that created itemization.info. I literally just texted with him before writing this.  
---
Dwarfs have the bis with guns more often than not. That makes them the ally BiS.
---
That seems kind of common. A lot of streamers who thought Classic would feel slow and boring changed their view after playing it, saying they still felt it was a little sluggish, but it was far more engaging and interesting than the rotation based grind of retail.
---
Lmfao
---
So then that exact same thing works for when people would inspect each other at org bank before a dungeon. Gear score that is properly coded and maintained to take into account BiS lists would just make it so that you don’t have to pull people to org to inspect their gear
---
Gnome racial will help on mage.

Escape Artist, 0.5 sec cast, 1 min cooldown. Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect.

Pfft, the real vanilla experience will be to play in your mind! Forget the lfg addons and the moblie phones! Imagination IS vanilla...
---
But, seriously, dude that sucks so bad. They usually fix these things before their estimates though, so fingers crossed for you!
---
This is a fair assessment but I will always argue that it’s a slippery slope. Once the higher ups see what kind of profit it can make they push the game designers to edge towards the dark side for profit.
---
You won’t use that much data even with voice comms. 10gig should get you though till your back up

---
Chad classic vs Virgin retail
---
eh technically no time has passed in classic since, well, that's kind of the point of it.
---
When leveling a warrior it's a very good idea to keep plenty of bandages, health potions, and buff food.  Warriors have a very hard time handling a second mob when leveling and a health potion at the right time can make all the difference.
---
you know it's classic when there's a clicker lol
---
It also let you pair up with other addon users, PRIVATELY.
---
I would like to see a paladin dad build. I only played vanilla wow and I only played casually so nothing to fancy.
---
It will absolutely not be like that this time around, much as it pains me to say that.
---
Community jokes?
---
It's just racism.
---
Probably for the best. Thanks
---
If you don't want to see LFG addons why don't you play private servers
---
This sub has become r/gatekeeping.
---
Even if you were alone on the server you wouldn't have enough linen by level 5 to craft anything.
---
If it were truly #nochanges then the server populations wouldn't be triple the old size. 
---
I gotta trust that layering will solve some of those problems but for real, I made an account a private server a couple days ago to get familiar with the controls, UI, and the starting zone and I definitely wasn't alone in this.
---
Even with the small amount of other players doing the same thing I was doing, completing some of the starting zone quests was a goddam chore. 
---
Blizzard has no idea what's coming. It's gonna be a goddam shitshow.
---
there are people getting super upset about stuff, and then there are people just happy Classic is coming out.    
---
After the addon hysteria dies down, the first group will find something new to be outraged about and tell everyone how it will ruin the game.
---
We lost so many good men out there...
---
Playing with the Yankees?
---
Oh...ya to trades, injuries...
---
You Americans are seriously fucked up.
---
I don’t think it was as widely known during the stress test
---
You're not integrating yourself into the community if that's how you feel. Nothing is stopping you from making friends in dungeons and raids with the addon and using those connections for future groups.
---
So I’m torn between mage and warrior. I’ve played mage since mop (when I started playing wow) and I’ve loved it because of its complexity. I plan on raiding semi hardcore and from what I’ve heard the dps rotation is really boring on mage. I’ve looked at the rotation for warrior and it seems a lot more involved. I also don’t really want to play a gnome so that might be factoring into my decision. Is the utility of mage going to beenough  to keep me entertained? Thanks

That's the problem with supposed QoL type changes in these expansive games.  One leads to the next, which leads to the next, and on the march of rolling changes goes.  This always continues to the point where all of the charm, challenge, and social aspects are destroyed in the name of quality of life.  
---
This is exactly why features like group finder, and gear score, and catch-up mechanics and more need to be left out of classic.  Each one created a side effect that was more damaging than the initial problem, if you even want to call it a problem to start with.

You're objectively wrong.
---
My first server was a pvp server because I didn't know any better. I found it to be deeply unfun. It's basically a completely different game thrown right into the middle of my pve rpg game. Game play-wise it's completely out of left field. Blizzard might as well add a PVM mechanic (player vs math) and hit you with random math problems while questing. All the same arguments apply. It's harder, adds random element, keeps you on your toes.
---
&gt; What the hell did they do to night elf male models?? In vanilla they look like such majestic badasses but in retail they look so doofy.
---
Well, to be fair, they never looked majestic in-game, the new icon is more spot-on.
---
Did you break anything slipping down that slope?
---
As a healer I have no problem letting dps who pull aggro die.
---
Do this enough times and people will learn to wait.
---
Notice how every single person who thinks it's bad for the game doesn't actually elaborate on why it is? Personally I'm on the fence, but I can't really imagine why it would be bad.  Who the fuck has time to sit in city chat for an hour and a half looking for A group?  I'd be open to hearing what the downside really is, though.

Not always.  Sometimes you tank a mob as you and pet burn another down.  
---
That said, its not like you melee the mob.  
---
Hunter strength is ranged.  Most of the time melee occurs its an oh shit moment.
---
It's the Holy Roman Empire of MMORPGs.
---
It's neither an MMO nor an RPG. It's a piece of shit with phasing and scaling out the ass.
---
The specific phrasing was removed before they added in the cross-faction speech potion, but the 'disruptive gameplay' portion remains: "conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others" is a bannable offense, so it's still against the tos (with some discretion on Blizz's part), faction is just no longer taken into consideration.
---
I've been running 1-12 every night following the guide. I have to say it seems like it's wrong and then you blindly follow it and understand what it's doing.

I think it's well done and I'll be following it all the way up!
---
As someone who tanked In vanilla and had to deal with this. Please don't wait for aggro. Let them suffer like I did. #Nochanges
---
How come? Are they changing something or do you think people will just go with a different strategy now?

My literal only goal is to spend the evening in line and log in and play enough to get out of the very starting zone to where things thing out. I am realistic.

If I decide to use zygors classic leveling guide will i need questie along side it or is it stand alone?? I haven't played wow for a good 8-9 years so im not totally sure on these things.
---
I dont care if they do recustomization, as long as you cant change your race and faction.
---
Changing your characters hair and face I have no issue with, doesnt affect gameplay.
---
why do they make you so triggered then? they're just farming mobs in a videogame.
---
When and where did they say this?  I'd be interested in reading the entire sentiment.
---
Hermione? Is that you?
---
&gt;I also find it funny when streamers complain about a LFG add-on. 
---
I think them making an argument for/against use is still a good thing, something doesn't have to personally impact you for you to actually care about it.
---
Could be attention seeking, playing devil's advocate, or simply being altruistic and doing it for the good of community. Any of those reasons could work.
---
I don't get why tho lol I thought this was pretty clear that automizing the grouping process was unpopular and something that takes away from the group building process 
---
idk tho maybe
---
Undead Rogue can use gun. It can be a way to pull for the group, but really rogues only use that slot for stats.
---
if you played in vanilla you should know that vanilla wotf is different than on retail. it not only breaks fear but also lasts 5 seconds. so your 2nd precast fear would just be immuned.
---
You can tank in any spec while leveling, just go into defensive stance and put on a shield. 
---
I don't pvp much so I'm not the best person to answer, but I believe the general consensus is that the 2H Arms build is better than the 2H Fury build for wpvp while leveling.
---
Nope. And if you don’t have anything intelligent or worthwhile to say then quit talking to me.
---
Lol ok

Realms will be open long before those times, just can't enter the world. Make sure you're in before, try to skip the queue.

I quit about the time that mythics and the first raid were coming out. I was pushing for everything, getting heroic gear, required achievements, leveling professions and farming gold hoping for the fun to arrive soon, and it just didn't. I started with vanilla and still defended WoW in Cata and MoP, but I no longer believe that it gets any better. My faith only goes so far that while I'm waiting for Classic to come out, I'm finishing the rep grind for Dark Iron Dwarfs in case I ever return to playing it seriously, because they were the race I was looking forward to the most.
---
Opinion;  
---
If you rely on figuring out how good someone is through a number like ilvl in classic, you have no idea what youre doing and the numbers game will only harm your chances.
---
This x100.
---
Yep for every person who done all the research and is ready to go on every level. Theres a 5 guys who just saw unbreakable and has dreams of being a WF god. I think one of the big benefits classic has. Is that unless you playing into your class fantasy and loving what your doing. It literally exhausts you. It will break at least half the joy sucking min maxxers because if your not enjoying the journey there. You will simply drop out around level forty from exhaustion.
---

I was 6 when i first started playing too, didn't get to max level on a character until wotlk where I got a taste of doing dungeons and raiding. Gonna be awesome to go back to vanilla and experience endgame content.
---
People laugh at the terrible itemization in vanilla, but I love that it makes previous tiers matter because of how bis gear spreads out. Blackwing lair drops a number of trinkets that are bis through the rest of the game. So guilds in Naxx still have reason to go back and do that raid to gear up alts or new recruits, but it isnt a total waste of time for the rest of the guild.

Get yourself a Razernaga or RazerTrinity and key bind everything. Use Right mouse button to pan the camera, both mouse buttons to move. 
---
Mage/Paladin would be my suggestion.
---
Would stay away from shaman, or hunter.
---
Trash like you and people who do this should stay on private servers and be forgotten.
---
FD for the win? (or maybe just delayed death)
---
You are forced to change your name upon login.
---
Once again NO. YOU SPECIFY the CHANNEL that this operates on. This doesn't operate on some secrete channel. Any channel that you use this on is accessible to others. What channels do you think people are most familiar with? Trade/General/LFG
---
Good? Now if you have some shitter going afk and pulling 0 weight you can just easily grab another. The other thing to consider though is most dungeons are pretty fucking impossible for 1 single person to get to without the rest of the group and a lfg plugin doesn't fix that.

Dumbarse...

what joke?
---
I’m willing to bet that only 25% of all day 1 players, if that many, have made characters. If we multiply the reserved character numbers by 4, those realms don’t stand a chance. Blitz has no idea how swamped they will be come release.
---
Welcome to Reddit.
---
But seriously I think people are just tired of waiting.
---
Can't wait for the Mage infographic!
---
I log in to see if anyone has freed up the names I want.  So far, no, no one has.
---
Anyone else agree?
---
Ya, I’m not worried. Even Pantheon, the future oldschool MMO made by the guy who made EQ will have an automated group finder.
---
Do 1h/shield warriors still do any damage or am I solely a tank?
---
Are you gonna hurt these gnomes?
---
As a holy paladin top kek m8 9/10
---
First point I can agree with. Second bit sounds like a bullshit explanation for what you’re trying to do - consolidate the market.
---
We'll just disagree then
---
..maugrim.. are you in my guild?
---
I fully twinked a priest with heirlooms and full strength enchants back before blizzard nerfed low level enchants, and pulling mobs constantly trying to get to 10 ASAP took me 27 minutes.
---
There’s no way 30 minutes is achievable for anyone trying to get on the forums from a fresh account.
---
As a former chanter/tailor, be aware that enchanting is expensive. It doesn't really pay off til over 40. You have to support your habit by making bags, flying carpets, and your own gear. Have fun chasing down those rare chant recipes. Look forward to lots of Dire Maul runs for 50-60 mats.
---
Hunter u get a pet who plays the game for u
---
Ban'em!
---
Remember when (https://youtu.be/PXg3p7De2ZY])[this] happened? Hope your bullshit mafia gets broken up!
---
Yea, I like taking breaks and I hate coming back to the raid I enjoyed being meaningless. It was especially bad in Wotlk when I moved during Ulduar progression which was an amazing raid and came back to TOC as the only thing to do which was garbage.
---
Damn, this is amazing and I'm crazy jealous. Good job.
---
Probably not gonna work.
---
Haha very true
---
Its easy enough to do manually. The problem is updating when you need to remove files. There should be an updated manager that handles classic before you need to worry about it.
---
So, I played all 3 roles in Retail on mythic level. I had more fun healing than tanking but most fun as RDPS so far.
---
Tanking is a lot like MDPS, you just use skills for Threat instead of Damage reasons (mostly). Healing feels like the most spontaneous role, as in you can freestyle and react accordingly in most situations.
---
Tanking instead is like DPS, pretty much planned through and you're basically Leader by default.
---
No need to feel intimidated though.
---
&gt;From the very start, we want an authentic classic experience, one where your own reputation matters.
---
they're just telling you what you want to hear.  realms are overpopulated at the start thanks to layers allowing them to be, your reputation won't matter at all.
---
The reason i wont be playing classic is, streamers and their communities will ruin every server.
---
People are a billion times more toxic than in vanilla over a decade ago.
---
Layering.
---
It just wont be the same. It will be a world of memes and cults and i dont want any part of it.
---
I actually think he is being serious.
---
I try to be a nice guy. You're welcome.
---
at the very low levels (dead mines and below), it's very difficult no matter what your spec. Just Stick with it, the more levels you gain the easier it gets.
---
Example  with level 20 and restro spec druid and +40 points healing gear all the rest green Int Spirit gear (amazing amount at such low level) doing dead mines with no member under level 18.
---
It was very hard to heal tanks, because warriors are all DPS spec'd and just equip a shield and call themselves a tank.  Burned 80 water, 20 mana potions,  in a single run, and the tank still died twice.
---
By the time we got to BRD it got much easier,
---
If you don't do this, you're a casual.
---
I’ve played with better players that had worse gear and ended up either doing better damage or were just an overall better group member. Your “GearScore” is the most irrelevant stat to me. 
---
You can gauge a lot about a player in the short communication before the invite. Let me use an obvious example, you’re spamming for a high level dungeon as a tank for some DPS, you get 3 whispers:
---
Player A: inv
---
Player B: hunter 
---
Player B: ??
---
Player C: Experienced Rogue
---
Which one would you invite? I’ll tell you from experience, Player C will be a better player on average, yes there will be exceptions, but it’s amazing how much you can gather by... wait for it... actually TALKING with prospective group members for 5 seconds over looking through a list and picking the biggest number. 
---
Everyone is welcome to do what they want in Classic, if you hate social interaction so much you must use these LFG addons, that’s your choice. I won’t be, not even interested because it’s not necessary.
---
Every now and then i log in and check a name that was taken a few seconds after name reservation. Did this now maybe every 2 or 3 days (yeah i know, casual).Today i did the same. And little did i know: HE ACTUALY WAS FREE NOW.LETS GOOO
---
Just battle res them guys.... wtf??
---
Yep exactly, i asked multiple guilds and wrote in general chat for fun if they are gonna play classic and most of people told me either that no its shit or that they will only try it out and focus on retail, so i think classic will have smaller playerbase than retail, since retail has more class depth and endgame is harder.
---
you no* take candle. Bastard ;)
---
The way you have to label them, othering them from yourself, then call them "your kind" is an angry sentiment. 
---
So.. you sound angry when you type that out.
---
wow - didn't even think of that... even hunter PETS had skills and special abilities that gave expanded player agency. Talking about class fantasy....
---
So it tripples feral dps!
---
Enjoy
---
Ok thanks, this makes the idea of moving to a less populated server harder.
---
I love a good lotr meme.
---
That guy's clearly an expert on vanilla and what is and isn't against the spirit of it
---
Those fights were designed before decursive existed, I'm sure. Bear in mind that before MC, there would have been little reason to make a whole mod for that. 5-man and strath/UBRS content didn't really warrant it.
---
Pretty sure when my guild cleared MC, there was little-to-nothing in the way of raiding mods. I don't think we used Raid Announce until BWL. Many otherwise avoidable Geddon wipes resulted from people being dopes about being the bomb.
---
Skeram is shaping up to be the best server in NA, it’s balanced, not full and I haven’t heard any drama from there.
---
Well here’s my issue, I’ve got a mate running mage AND mage is always highest populated dps on a pvp server
---
But how does this LFG addon stop that?  It just facilitates people into a group.  You're still needing to run/fly to a dungeon, still need to run the dungeon (which isn't neutered in difficulty like LFR does in retail) so that's how you make friends and add then to your friend's list to run stuff later.
---
I'll just make my own guild with blackjack and hookers
---
do you trust the friends to stick with the game? then alliance. if you believe they likely will be tourists and wont even make it to max, go horde.   
---
mages can conjure stuff to eat, and undead can eat the humanoids they kill.. seems a little redundant. but play the way you want obviously
---
Cheers! Blonde Jaina is our girl
---
You are able to tank in any Spec like you can heal in any spec.
---
Prot pallys can tank in 5 man. Same thing with Shamans. Just bring the proper gear to do it.. once you hit the raiding scene You will have to go prot for Raids if you are MT you can MAYBE get away with the OT.. as far as PVP goes not viable at all. if you are going with a 2h you will want MS.  I've seen Fury work wonders in PVP though with Dual 1H hell Dagger/Sword is a great combo too
---
that is great to know for a future mage-y. thanks so much :D
---
Right, but even as a RL, I'd still rather have one Feral Druid on the roster who can tank if/when necessary (even if only OT and/or for when shit hits the fan, where he can BRes the MT and Challenging Roar to hold aggro waiting for said MT to get back online), even if I'd also rely on Warriors 95% of the time for MT, as far as "preference" is concerned.
---
That said, I maintain that an "exceptional" Druid tank will still do better than a "just okay" Warrior, but I get your point that you'd still rather have an "exceptional" Warrior than either of them.
---
That’s not a bad idea. I’ll probably follow that and make sure I can get my mount first then switch to eng. skinning will be easy too.
---
Queue times and also Fairbanks has controversy right now with some guilds organizing cross realm 'mafias' if you will.
---
I agree, but really hope you are wrong
---
Wait before they notice discord servers
---
What has he accomplished
---
Where are people planning on farming gold as mages until DM is released?
---
It's not too late fam
---
Explain me the funny part please. I can only see the political message.
---
And I replied to the message saying that Blizzard likes to take the moral highground by banning this kind oh humor. Don't be fooled, this reply was highly political.
---
With all the experience Blizzard has on this stuff it would shock me if we experience anything like the first days of the game.
---
Yeah ZF is just awesome, I think tanaris as a whole is such a cool change of pace especially for alliance
---
Well get ready to keep on missing it because that sucker is phase 4 =(
---
Of course they still do damage, just less than everyone else :)
---
Yep there is no way to “donate” to wow classic and get the admins in your pocket.
---
Drustvar was going crazy yesterday. I've actually been able to complete a lot of world PvP quests in the past few weeks.
---
Actually maintenance costs for classic should be lower than retail in the long run. With the added bonus that your player base isn’t expecting any more development.
---
!RemindMe 6 days
---
Westfall, always.....we are going home...
---
you talking about dual wield tank? 😐
---
you can be certain many ppl will have twinks fully geared and ready to go for the release of BGs
---
you are right, you are supposed to pronounce the P.  It started as a type in i think a warcraft 3 mod and spiraled from there

What are the downsides / challenges of playing a Mage that aren't often talked about?
---
I'm still torn between Warrior and Mage and I'm leaning towards Warrior (just because I've always played a melee class and I like the option of off tanking)
---
I hope people play classic, and I love classic, but it's not going to kill retail. It'll either reinvigorate it, or be a side-dish to it.

---
Hate to break it to you, but the lack of interaction that you lot (who whine about every little thing thats not personally catered to your every whim) will experience is not because of an addon - It's because you're an outrage chasing, entitled man-child who possesses zero redeeming quailities and people will steer clear of your predictable insistent whining in global.
---
You drew a Rogue, but let's be real, Priests are the real assholes on boats.
---
What dungeon finder was like in Vanilla: [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dungeon\_Finder#History](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dungeon_Finder#History)
---
Yeah, shouldn't be that bad.  I agree, better to have it and not need it.  Like I said, I can give you an idea from my stress test data usage if you want more details to help pick out a data package that could work.  I just don't know if you're planning to play 12 hours a day or only a few hours a day, as that has an impact on how much data you'll use.
---
That's not a prediction. The addon includes and shows your LFG status to people without it. You literally don't need it even if 99% of the population has it, therefore it isn't a 'must have'.
---
So they didn't have to do artwork for allied races
---
Good luck. They’ll move when they see a 20 hour queue. Go ahead and reserve a name on skeram or the new servers Monday.
---
Because it's the start of the toxic elitist bullshit that turned retail so impersonal. 
---
I want to group with people, not numbers.
---
The implication is that things might go wrong for the gnome if she refuses to come below deck with me. Not that things are gonna go wrong for her, but she's thinking that they will.
---
The game doesn’t start at 60. Many people will chug along slowly.
---
6 months at 10 hours a week is almost 11 days played. I'm a casual player as well, you just really have to be efficient with the time that you do have to play. Use a quest helper addon like Questie, and log off inside of the Inns to gain rested xp.
---
Yep!
---
Can you drop the link please ??
---
I don't think many groups will be so damn picky that they'll only accept priest/pala healers. Druids are perfectly good healers, especially if you're just in dungeons.
---
I'm rolling resto druid so I am probably a little biased though ;)
---
In classic?
---
Why did you think Min/Maxing, which was a huge part of vanilla, wouldn't be in classic?
---
Yup. Another example of how the retail situation is deplorable.
---
don't let the population of the class be a factor for choosing. Just play what you want and excel and then the population won't matter.
---
Well.. yeh. Because lots of ppl dont want that addon and disagree with you if you are for it. Thats jow down and upvotes work
---
lil breezy?
---
I've never heard of 2H and tanking but fury warrior tanking is a thing if you want to look into that. That's what I will be playing while leveling up. Don't pay attention to any of these other idiots laughing at you. But yeah, look into fury/prot warrior if you want to do DPS/tank while having a challenge.
---
Why do you say that? I want to play a melee class that can off tank and tank 5 mans so its easy to get into a group. I was a main tank in mop and enjoyed it (DK Tank). I like rogue just don't want to constantly be a dps. I like Paladin but not sure if I would like healing (have never really tried it). If I where to go paladin I would go reckadin build or whatever its called. Warrior seems like my kind of class, just not really willing to respec a lot.
---
&gt;died suddenly. Young and healthy
---
i doubt that
---
no, a bigass 2h sword, not duel wielding
---
How is it angry? They’re different than me. Pointing out the obvious doesn’t make me angry. Why do people online always try to force the “u mad” meme. Just because we’re playing a game from 2004 doesn’t mean your entire personality has to be based from that era.
---
Why do we assume gearscore wont account for Classic itemization? Who is going to use an addon that fails to realize the value of Edgemasters or Wolfs Head?
---
Would you rather me say "LF2M Onyxia, link all gear and spec in whisper" so I can take a bit longer to realize that you're trying to swing above your weightclass?
---
If you're playing irregularly you'll accumulate a lot of rest xp. Will shorten the days played required to hit 60. 
---
Will still take a fair long while though. Which is good. As others have said...there are no surprises here. The journey is the destination.
---
Imagine asking someone how they chose their class and they show you this post
---
Make Azeroth Great Again
---
You're the man! Bless your heart!
---
Rockbiter is almost as good dps wise and much more consistent. There is nothing to be afraid of.
---
Just an observation.
---
Weren’t the type of people complaining about all these “minor details”, the same vocal crowd that complained for years about no legacy realms?
---
If not, then ask yourself, would the game be better if it were closer to the original Vanilla? No matter how minor? If so, let them complain, they might get heard. Is their complaining _that_ offensive to you?
---
Complainers complaining about complainers?
---
I still cant decide if I want to go undead rogue, or warrior, or orc hunter. Currently my character is undead rogue.
---
Fun fact: tauren "melee leeway" range is farther than their War Stomp
---
No it doesnt stop getting second hand infomation you sheep
---
It is now though, if it results in disruptive gameplay experiences cross faction collusion is still not allowed.
---
It was high last night when I looked at it
---
Why do you even answer if you answer is: "I know a couple of places :)" Gtfouttahere
---
Is this real or a joke?
---
But does wasting time = better experience though?  No.  Now I say that in the same vain of saying well put flying in, but that does drastically change the exp. while also saving a shit load of time.
---
Wand Wand Wand Wand Wand
---
Wand Wand Shadowform Flay Wand
---
Flay Wand Flay Wand  Heal
---
I remember that addon. It stopped being updated and I never did run into another similar addon. Hopefully there's something out there.
---
You can have both a private and public Discord. Atleat that's what has been done in the past.
---
I enjoy healing, usually played healers on retail since TBC.
---
But leveling a healer in a world with no dual spec and a much longer leveling time is really quite unappealing. Especially knowing that druids can't OOC rez and priest leveling is pretty grim compared to leveling a DPS class :(
---
I suspect the tank/healer shortage of vanilla may be quite authentically recreated in Classic...  Especially on PvP servers full of rogues.
---
Nah, I'm quite normal tbh.
---
Nope they parse the chat to give you relevant info too ban them as well
---
Issa joke
---
Hey man some of us gotta sweep chimneys to afford the sub!
---
Meth
---
New raids after Naxx. That's all. No quality of life changes. Nothing that makes the game more like retail. Keep it simply classic but just more raids to have fun in
---
Fuck off
---
Why are you trying /assist him?
---
Anyone who said "Only WoW can kill WoW" wasn't wrong
---
ok
---
Jesus christ. It hasn't even launched yet and people are already worried about what's next. 
---
How about just play classic and enjoy it? We've waited long enough for this already, why ruin it by making something else to wait for?
---
I personally hope they keep Classic WoW on its own fork and always keep us at level 60, but just release new content and scale gear as time goes on.
---
here we go with this shit now...
---
Or....OR....you could not get hung up on the whole name thing and just join Blaumeux now? West coast, PVP, and according to the poll on the site, pretty damn good faction balance!
---
I already clicked F eight years ago during Cataclysm.
---
I’m still interested if you’re saying it’s less then a $75 cup of coffee😂
---
My wife and I can't play together for this reason. So won't read anything (well she might when she can't find the mobs), but I'll be reading all the text, soaking in the lore, and just goofing about. Haha, we can't be leveling partners.
---
What realms are gonna be best for horde? Like what’s everyone’s server!? I picked Fairbanks.
---
Q
---
I'm not going to full cast a frostbolt if that means overlapping my fireblast if it's off cd. I would rather scorch, blast or such combo.
---
I'd say retail has more content on a quantity scale, but Vanilla is engrossed in quality driven by the fact that it forces community. 
---
Hope you see you in the Eastern Kingdoms, Custap
---
Gotcha.  Whole guild moved from Herod to Stalagg when it was brought out, and now it's high and facing extended queue times so we're all scrambling to make a choice.  Might just do Incendious at this point lol.
---
OP been asleep for 26 hours
---
I would love to experience TBC without flying mounts.
---
:V
---
The day I get my Thunderfury Bindings... still waiting for that day. Wish me luck.
---
Haha, got me good too, well done
---
I lol'd.
---
And Bfa at once
---
As a reminder (this may not affect your decision), for those in North America, Classic launches on the 26th @ 3 PM PDT.
---
Orc is several tiers above all other options, for ALL classes.
---
I would not look at the TOS for this, I’d look at the code of conduct which is a separate document. Here’s a quote:
---
Cheating
---
You are responsible for how you and your account are represented in the game world. Cheating in any fashion will result in immediate action. Using third-party programs to automate any facet of the game, exploiting bugs, or ***engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating.***
---
Exploiting other players is an equally serious offense. Scamming, account sharing, win-trading, and anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players will receive harsh penalties.
---
Colluding with the opposing faction would be considered engaging in an activity to grant an unfair advantage, it’s in a way, a form a win trading as well. That being said I haven’t heard anything about Fairbanks and don’t know the context at all.
---
Well, when I picked Atiesh it was low pop. Now it's high and probably almost full. I feel like anywhere you choose to go there will be people around you.
---
“Fuck me, enjoy the game”
---
Maybe some people have been through the leveling experience before and just want to get end game so they can start doing the end game content? There’s so much gatekeeping on this sub around how to have fun with this game. How about you just worry about yourself and let others enjoy it how they want?
---
Tips for leveling a mage with a priest buddy?
---
For reference, I never got past 20 or so in vanilla, back in the day.
---
You don't need prot at low levels- arms will be fine. You can go 2H or keep a sword/shield handy if you want to be tankier.
---
I'd go deep prot for the late game dungeons at 55+ or 58+ if you're still questing. You will really gimp your killing during questing if you go prot.
---
NO CHANGES  
---
go back
---
You should use that sign to recruit for your guild.
---
Whenever I play on a Paladin I like to always give people the least useful buff.
---
Might on casters, Wisdom on melee. IDK why but it entertains me
---
TBC Classic of course
---
You reminded me to do it for the 5th time today. Brb.
---
And discord lfg channels...
---
hes just going through withdrawals
---
Not what he’s asking. He’s asking if saving the name “Arnold” will save it just on that server, or on every server and the name be locked only to his account.
---
Yea trying is the key word lol
---
 It sure that’s how this works but 👌
---
Do not change day 2 to anything that isn’t FOUR SYLLABLES.
---
How is this breaking the TOS?
---
Im going horde for the first time on classic launch. I hope its not everything i see on this sub when I actually play.
---
One of my favorite news stories this year was a Pro player getting mad at the younger players for playing Fornite on their phones in the dugout instead of watching the game. 
---
So if (when) they bring WoW to mobile...
---
If you don't wipe you won't spend extra time in the dungeon.
---
I'm glad somebody else is talking about the sounds. This is something I complained about a lot and nobody seemed to care, the new mage sounds (especially frost) and rogue stuns sound horrible and weightless.
---
Play what you want
---
If you will always be leveling together, then just go prot.
---
His dots/dps will do great job killing.  You just focus on keeping the mobs sundererd and rending.
---
Ion lies about Layering but tells trooth about LFG Addons - cognitive dissonance at its finest!
---
same as BIZZNO
---
Yeah that helps a bit with survivability but it was still pretty rough. And a shitton of down time
---
My dude
---
If you aren't eating noodles and drinking cherry soda you're doing it wrong. 
---
Unfortunately, I am doing it wrong because I dont wanna be a fat fuck. So it's low cal miso noodles and water for me.
---
Thanks for the heads up then! I feel like it's safe to assume that it will have "high" queues now so I'd recommend that other players wait until monday's server release.
---
Yeah best make sure warden is looking for discord running and close down wowclassic instantly if it is
---
Right but it doesn't get used much anymore since there's hardly any reason to travel to Ironforge, and if you do you can just take an instant portal
---
No problem fren
---
Giant swaths of people are avoiding Warlock because they need to kill 20 random mobs that give exp before a raid. That takes a few minutes and can be done outside just about any raid.
---
You have to continuously farm a low level item from a low level dungeon for the entirety of your Classic career if you want to play Feral well.
---
Seems ok in the sense that it's horribly constricting and linear.
---
if your part of a trio or more,  warlock can summon herself, then heart back to town to sell, repair,  restock then accept their own summons back to party location.
---
Repeat for each party member if needed.
---
It's situational, but nice when it works out.
---
Fun fact taurens hit boxs is bigger to making you easier to hit
---
Especially the undead, going from, well, an undead to "pale human"
---
I would if I used spotify.  I'm old fashioned. I store my music locally.  Can enjoy it without internet at any time that way.
---
26**
---
A bit in the same boat. I'm a veteran and will be doing a warrior with group but a hunter when I'm solo. My girlfriend is also rolling frost mage after watching the cinematic and screaming "I want Ice Hands!". Unfortunately we're split up a bit by race starting zones but, our group for classic is about 10 so she'll thankfully be supported in the beginning.   
---
Anyways to answer your question more, I think the experience they should be having is whatever class fantasy they want most so, if she wants to shoot frost bolt be a mage, if she wants to heal be a priest.
---
Although, one thing I'm looking forward to is aoe farming cloth on her account in the future. 
---
Additionally I think that in dungeons for classic, healing would be the harder/ more important role so it's best to leave it to more experienced players. 
---
But ultimately, play whatever she thinks looks the most fun :)
---
I think they are both viable picks and it depends what you are looking for.
---
Tauren is going to have about a 10-12 yard auto attack range with both you and the target running, orc is going to have a max of...8 if i remember right. The distance is significant but will not help with roots, just slows and having a larger melee range.
---
Orc stun resist is extremely good, base stun resist is 5% with orc stun resist this goes to 30% which should mean about 1 in 3 stuns someone uses on you will be resisted. 
---
With a major aspect of classic being open world pvp and raids will 100% be a joke, a lot of people will focus more on open world and BG's which means more people will get engineering and resisting a grenade stun will be extremely useful.
---
In fairness he wanted to be super edgy, but Turbosoldier was taken.
---
Who's Omar and what are all these memes about?
---
He was the best warrior tank in vanilla iirc
---
I’m more convinced than ever that people don’t know what a syllable is.
---
It's a good theme for a meme and one day someone is going to crack it.

week 1 ragnaros?
---
Why doesn’t he play? Is he sick?
---
Plenty of PvP in most zones. Hopefully you kill them before they kill you.
---
And then there is the slaughterhouse, STV itself.

I'm not worried about hunters needing on weapons. What is worrying to me is all these pre-raid BiS lists telling hunters that it's OK to roll need on Hand of Justice if somebody else in the party needs it. As soon as Dire Maul comes out hunters get a trinket with hit%, attack power I think which is better than HoJ but hunters will be stealing the trinket that is BiS for warriors throughout all content in Vanilla just so they can have 20 attack power for 1 phase. Infuriating.
---
The problem is itll be okay for the first day or two, and then you’ll inevitably go out of sync.
---
Yeah you right. I totally forgot they come out in phase three when I posted that. I’m still looking forward to them.
---
I don't think it can be done.
---
r/4PanelCringe
---
Would you be willing to upload this to Imgur? For easier downloading? I can then PDF it all into 1 file and upload it to Gdrive
---
Because this sub has turned into nothing but gatekeeping and people telling others how to enjoy the game. It’s hilarious.
---
But 7 dwarven ghosties was my fav part..
---
If you do that, you lose a lot of damage on the shatter combo. Taking an extra second to cast Frostbolt instead of Scorch is absolutely worth it.
---
An addon that simply invites people that whisper you is nowhere close to retail's LFG tool.
---
Your peanut brain is totally doubling down on this slippery slope fallacy.
---
I don't consider filtering through chat wasting time. You get to see current things going on with your server, what the trolls are up to, the drama, interact with the rest of the people. It makes the community tighter IMO.
---
I believe it's 4 yes
---
If you are lucky enough to get in right at server launch, there are tricks to get ahead of the pack quickly. For instance in Durotar go straight to the named scorpion quest and kill a few mobs, and you'll get to level 3 while everybody is chasing boars. In Deathknell you grind instead of killing the zombies that everybody is fighting over.
---
Then once you are 1 level ahead of the pack, you can just quest as fast as you can with much less competition and the stragglers get stuck in a clusterfuck.
---
I wish I could but that shit hits home quite well.
---
This is awful lmao
---
Yep! It's an older system than retail however so each pet has a summon item and if you wanted to use it, it took up bag space.
---
Also, there's no pet fighting or whatever the heck there is now.
---
Nothing, it’s an awesome race and an awesome starting zone. I noticed it was the least crowded on the stress test too though. The orc/troll starting area has 2 races and I guess undead is really popular.
---
If you use the search function, you'll find a bunch.
---
I'm going for decently fast. The most efficient leveling method will be dungeon grinding so we are only really concerned about getting to lvl11-12(since we're horde and can start grinding mobs in RFC as early as 11). Typically it's about tagging mobs efficiently and getting out of the starter zone at a high enough level to quest, but fast enough to not be crowded.
---
Can confirm. Got made fun of when TBC launched for taking the time to level a new race and class while my friends just went up 10 lvls. Not only did I make the raid before some of them (i think 3rd lockout i made it) but I was destroying melee dps so hard they wanted me to stay Ret instead of going holy when I got the gear like I intended to.
---
Or better yet... victory lunges!
---
he probably meant dwarf
---
TBH its will be a few days before i can play properly and instead of trying yo squeeze in a few hours here then there i will finish irl stuff then pick it up. my reason for this is because for first few days its gonna be a madhouse imo everyone will be camping hogger etc etc im treating classic like an expansion release give it a few days so all the hardcore people get a few lvls ahead and they can spend hours fighting over zebra hooves or bandanas and by time i play they will already have moved on haha
---
Server transfers are fine. Just don't sell them as a microtransaction.
---
So, there are less "toys" to play with, so to speak. No Ice Lance, no stupid ball of frost that gets stuck on a rock, etc. In return, you get your arcane and fire spells back. In practice, that doesn't mean much in PVE as you'll be spamming frostbolt until your "2" key breaks. In PVP, though, it's pretty dang fun. You can open up with fire or arcane to eat a kick and then switch to frost to ensure your bolt goes off. You can use rank 1 FB (with its fast cast time) to land the snare on people. 
---
Shatter combos are just as important as ever, so you might do something like soften a target up, Nova when trinket is down-&gt; Arcane Power-&gt;FB-&gt;POM FB-&gt;Fire Blast-&gt;Arcane Explosion/CoC/Whatever
---
I personally would take vanilla mage pvp any day over whatever it was I was doing in Legion/BfA. Granted, I don't remember it SUPER well because it was forever ago, but oh boy, POM pyros were a blast. A Pyroblast.
---
Is this guide going to stay free?
---
ah, going for min/max eh? What is the 265 enchanting bis trinket? I don't have much experience with Engineering, I just know that it is very useful in PVP.
---
As a OG vanilla enchant/tailor mage, my experience was:
---
* As a high level enchanter, you'll always be wanted in trade chat
---
* income from the bags you create thru tailoring (plus your Mooncloth cooldown and whatever else, but bags of all sizes are always wanted)
---
* people will pay you to port them to cities, so just lingering around cities while doing stuff outside the game helped net gold
---
The downside of having an alt with enchanting is that you can't enchant stuff on your main (but if you have a guild enchanter, you can just pass the mats to them and have them do it). I wasn't worried about pre-raid BiS stuff back then (nor was I aware that was really a thing), so can't help ya there. I just did high level dungeons to gear up, didn't really focus on buying BiS items or getting a profession solely for a BiS item. High level tailoring *did* help though, as I think there was a nice pre-raid chest piece you could craft.
---
It largely depends. Sometimes if you see someone else, you can try the "friendship wiggle" and if they wiggle back, you're safe... maybe.
---
More often you seem to just ignore each other. But there is no agreements so just be paranoid for as long as they're around or throw the first fireball and teach that dirty alliance a lesson... ahem.
---
There's no way of telling, basically, and that's what makes a pvp realm so much fun. Trust no one, even if it seems peaceful and friendly.
---
Are you going for speed?
---
If so, look up an AoE guide (mages are insane levelers via kiting with Blizzard / frost nova)
---
&gt; That means less profit per dollar of cost.
---
Also less development cost, they wouldn't have done it if it didn't cost them as much resources as say making a new expansion.
---
There is a difference between a Spec dealing 1/4 of the Damage naturally and not having the last 5gs to be invited in your pug.
---
This has been posted already...
---
you could just stream it, which is just recording it.
---
Wait I don't get it. Is this thread about not wanting microtransactions or not changing game mechanics?
---
lmfao
---
The picture isn't perfect but I didn't have the courage to screenshot it myself on Retail, I'm sorry :c
---
The idea is to have these two characters as our secondary ones that we only level together. We'll both have mains for when the other isn't on.
---
Thanks for the reply! I think I am just going to go 2h Furry even at max level because I love playing with a 2H Axe! I am not min maxing at all because I think that takes the fun away from playing the game. Just wanted to make sure it is viable not optimal lol.
---
Tell me exactly how we should benefit from your post? You say you know a couple of places, but dont wanna tell them, and they might not be good? Hmm ok? You might aswell not say anything then.
---
Escape artist is one of the best racials in the game, but less so as a mage since you have block and blink. You lose a snare break and gain nothing. I changed to horde to avoid having to roll a gnome for the 3rd time :P Now  it's undead or nothing :)
---
Not sure if that helps
---
dang im late
---
Free bands
---
Especially when you get the DM blues that are better than T1/MC stuff for pretty much every class in some slot.
---
Yeah, it's the eviscerate animation too.
---
I'll take a useless buff over no buff any day
---
Not gonna lie in dungeons  expect your pet to ninja pull it will happen. over time you will get better with pet management it the more you play group content. You should always use your pet and keep it happy and turn off growl or you will have an unhappy tank.
---
Why not start our own coalition? Goals: Stop the Fairbanks Super Coalition from having a dominant control of Black Lotus. Reverse manipulate the AH to stabilize prices.
---
The only thing that can kill WoW... is WoW it self.
---
The addon isn't required for the convenience so it will never be required.  It utilizes the same shit that people without the addon utilize to find groups, and by doing so it means that people using it will see and invite people without the addon to their groups.  
---
There will be no need to use it if you don't want to, but you won't be able to tell if someone else is using it or not either because on your end they will just see that you've left a message in the LFG channel and they will send you an invite.
---
Zip udsh1sqegdth8fuuh2 2c2hgqh ugh uwaghw29gk2jjiutrg
---
None, because 99% of the time they're not even on my same server.  There's no feel to befriend any of them.
---
The difference is that classic still keeps groups on the same server.  You might actually see that kick ass mage who was in your group again, so you have more incentive to add them to your friends list.
---
Like I said, this addon just speeds the group creation process.  You're going to get people using Discord LFG as well, so the whole "but you can group outside of a town" is irrelevant since we might as well start talking about banning server discords, which won't happen.
---
Yeah I don't think there is any data to back this claim but I could be incorrect. I've been playing alliance since I turned 15 back when I got BC. I know for a fact everyone I play with has too,  but people I never played with but knew they played, kids at school and what not, played horde mostly. 
---
I think it's all the same.
---
For real - like after phase 6 what do you do on a pve server? I cant even noodle through why its appealing.
---
How can you confuse the best race in the game with the worst race in the game?
---
That's what I was thinking too and I don't think it'll screw me over too much if we run into pvp trouble. And yes, these are secondary characters we only plan on leveling together and have mains to play when the other isn't on.
---
Scorch + blast means you get blast on cd earlier and you get two chances at impact tag. If your Frostbolt gets fucked you've now lost 2.X in casting time and you've missed fireblast cd.
---
Depended on server. Many tilted heavily to one faction. So if you were on the positive faction you were mostly fine. 
---
For p1 there isn’t much else to do. So people will probably gank a lot.
---
Haha yeah :)
---
Implying that he would play horde...
---
Is that why we have a fifth of r/wow subscribers?
---
Hope you didnt post this on one of the community discords I guarantee thats an instaban from stalagg mods at least
---
Please Blizzard, no more realms. Let me be done.
---
So you've already killed Garr and are still doing quests in EP?
---
not a bad idea but doubt blizz would ever do it
---
5?
---
That's optimistic.
---
Did you never play classic wow previously?
---
If you're alone and they're alone- not all that often.
---
It's when you encounter a couple of the enemy and you're alone or outnumbered... prepare for battle.
---
If you and 1 other dude are both staring at each other, slightly out of range... give a /wave and see if he waves back. Usually that's the go-ahead for "I see you, let's both keep questing". You can kill him a minute later if you want to be a dick.
---
race doesnt matter, in the grand scheme of things
---
Min maxing? Engineer 100%
---
Casual / semi-hardcore = Choose whatever you feel will enhance your experience.

Yes boys! Just finished and got next week booked off - gonna smash it!
---
Yeah it's also a server dynamic.  It's different on every server.
---
this is my kind of low effort post
---
if you're good  rarely
---
Yeah from Polish (EU?) perspective it makes no sense.
---
&gt;In general, you don't say 11th of October you say October 11th. That's where it comes from, and isn't quite as illogical as it seems at first glance.
---
Ohh i Didn't knew about that.
---
I have no idea what level of moderation memes have been getting on this subreddit but that's not going to stop me from forming strong opinions about it!
---
&gt;”Cross-Realm BGs killed Classic”
---
Why are you quoting this? Surely no one has said this, ever? In vanilla they didn’t refer to the game as classic
---
Not enough CRT
---
You'll be fine. 
---
DPS difference will be relatively insignificant. The biggest loss will be losing escape artist for PvP, but perception is also very strong, IMO.
---
Basically free rogue detection for 20 seconds. The 10% reputation gain can be a pretty huge QoL bonus later, too.
---
The fact that there are only such trivial things left with which  to complain is a testament to how well Blizzard has done so far.
---
That being said, some people just want to be mad at things.
---
Imagine every single toxic asshole in retail throughout the years. All of the ones we've lost because of the changes.
---
Imagine every single toxic asshole who has been screaming at Blizzard to bring back Vanilla since BC launched.
---
Imagine every single toxic asshole who pleasures themselves at seeing anyone not enjoying WoW. Who /spit on customers who buy store mounts. Who sit around and troll trade chat because they're bored with retail.
---
Imagine all of these toxic assholes in one game. That's Classic. Ironically, the community of Classic for me will be more insular. Because there is no way in hell my ignore list will be less than maximum by the time I hit 60.
---
Wahhh
---
For a second I was like "Where is the Tauren?" 
---
  Eyes slowly drift to the left. "Okay then."
---
I mean the people who out level everyone ideally gears up then carries the slow people to quickly gear up pre-raid bis. Then even more ideally secure your friends spots in their raid group
---
Who hurt you?
---
Right okay dude. The guys with 8 world first kills and the de-facto theory crafters for all of BC definitely messed up the math. 
---
Thunderfury received 1 nerf during all of Burning Crusade, and it was during the pre patch. The weapon was just as valuable as a threat generator in Karazhan as it was in Black Temple. But hey, keep talking out your ass. 
---
&gt;[Patch 2.0.10](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.10) (2007-03-06): The threat generated from the [proc](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Proc) has been substantially reduced. The threat generation from a proc of Thunderfury was previously equivalent to that of approximately one application of [Sunder Armor](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Sunder_Armor) from a lvl 60 [warrior](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Warrior).
---
If you want to raid seriously, you need to have engineering (by seriously i mean minmaxing). Its a min-max mandatory profession for all dps/tanks pretty much.
---
If you're not talking minmax, then pick whatever, Blacksmith is nice. Alchemy and enchanting are both great.
---
&gt;Sugar will give you a quick rush that will subside into a sugar low
---
Pretty sure science proved that's a myth.
---
Wouldn't it be more immersion breaking if someone has the same exact hair for years?
---
If you play a stealthy you can almost never get killed. Otherwise it will happen at least once every long play session
---
Or have coffee that expensive??
---
Again, reading comprehension seems to be a shortcoming in your already extremely shallow skillset.
---
The takeaway is, like I've said the previous two times, is that the "best" farming spots people provide are going to be horribly inaccurate, revisionist, and probably not even applicable due to value changes from actual vanilla.
---
Best of luck to you in the future with your mental issues.

It's called adaptation. They changed the game progressively, patch after patch, expansion after expansion, until it became something totally different. They asked players what they wanted, and gave it to them. But remember, most players have absolutely terrible taste or preference.
---
It still can
---
No only anub unfortunately
---
the subreddit confuses me
---
Soon
---
What's MV?
---
Yeah so excited to play troll
---
Funnel cloth to one person
---
.... But sunder shows a debuff with a counter on it. 
---
Wait for two sunders because by then the tank has landed a shield slam and probably a revenge.
---
&gt; I never had to join a guild in vanilla and managed to pug everything so that's a lie
---
What did I lie about? I gave 2 options, make friends or join a guild. If neither of those are appealing, then why play a version of the game where community and the social aspect is such a big impact on quality of life?
---
Its just a low effort meme bro, so no I dont mind ;0
---
I don't like live all that much, so I hope that it provides evidence to John Blizzard that the game needs to change in order to be better, and more p r o f i t a b l e, OR in the best possible scenario, the game splits in two, the older RPG-centric style, and the newer style more in line with its competetors like FF14 and ESO, the older game expanding itself while retaining the old-school ethos the original game has, but improving upon it. It's bound to capture a niche of some sort that'll work from a business standpoint, considering that older RPGs have been making a resurgance, and if you produce one, that niche is likely to buy it
---
I remember my luckiest night like it was yesterday.  I was on my healadin main doing a DM run for a friends warlock epic mount quest.  We are trucking along when it drops.  Faror’s compendium of dragonslaying.  Everyone starts congratulating the tank when he says “Guys, I’ve already got it.  Im just waiting on an Onyxia run to finish the quest.”  So since it was class “Warrior, Paladin” item, they all decide to let me have it even though I TOLD them I’m just going to sell it.  No argument from me!  Finished the run, took some screenshots with the new Dreadsteed, hit the AH and went to bed.  A few hours later I wake up to let the dog out and decide to hop on and check the auction house.  As soon as I zone in I get a whisper: 
---
“HEY ARE YOU SAVED TO ZG??”
---
No....but I’m not staying on....
---
Come on!  We are at the panther boss and one of our healers dc’ed.  We are just doing this one boss and then we are done!
---
Fine, I’ll come help.  We one shot the boss, and lo and behold it drops the Zulian scepter of rites.  Won the roll and boom, nice upgrade for healing!  Then I notice that during the fight I got a mail from the AH!  My compendium sold, giving me enough money to but the remaining mats I needed for my epic charger quest chain!  
---
Best night ever.
---
Honestly, I don't hate Retail, it's just not the game for me anymore. They lowered the bar for entry, started focusing on non-gameplay elements to attract new users (lots of weird races and stuff that I don't really care about), and turned the gameplay I did like into a themepark-like MMO so it would be easier to advance the story and keep people engaged. While I respect those might have been the right changes to keep the money flowing, it has completely changed the feel of the game, and turned things like dungeons into soulless, effortless distractions. 
---
Classic, on the other hand, should be completely different. If you started playing in TBC (so did my little brother) you should feel much more at home in Classic then you do BfA. A lot of users on this sub are very passionate about racing to 60 and being as efficient as possible, but rest assured there are a good bit of us that will take our time and will be looking to have a fun chat with you along the way.
---
Ahh another enlightened individual playing an Orc Warrior like myself
---
damn this is underrated and so great
---
So is mage really only fun in PvP? And then all PvE content is boring? I'm going on a PvP server, but I'll likely do way more PvE content and I'd like to...ya know have fun with my class with all content.
---
My roommate way back got a Dark Whelpling before getting Black Drake's Heart off the Scalding Whelps in Badlands.
---
 It you said “everything” hmm... seems like maybe a guild could help.
---
it's one player per 4 weeks actually, you need to be rank 13 and be the have the highest amount of honor on your faction for 4 weeks in a row or you don't get 14

Anyone know if details has a threat meter?
---
[This page](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/details-damage-meter-classic/) says "**tons of plugins, e.g. threat meter,**", but when I tested it in a 1.13 sandbox I couldn't find it in any of the menus.
---
Cease, you alliance scum!
---
Every community in anything is toxic if you look in the right places, especially on reddit.
---
Oh I see thanks!
---
What do you think about picking up Permafrost in your spec ([something like this](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=mage&amp;l&amp;t=JBpwqKqLqMqNpEqSpBqRpJpKC3C4JhJiJjpIp7p8supLqXqYqZq0pMsvswpxq6JCzapRrgrhp6pHpGqPqQ)) and then following up your opening Fireball with a quick low rank Frostbolt cast to gain the benefit of the 8 second 50% slow?
---
I'm literally going to laugh at the absolute scrubs that try to check anyone for item level. If you check for item level, you have no place in my groups, raids, or guilds, because you clearly just don't get it. You'll probably be a detriment to the raid/group, and you're going to bring that cancerous ideology to the guild.
---
Yeah, but some guilds only care about competitive dps for progression raiding.
---
My guild is pretty hardcore, but we are telling people not to bother with flasks and expensive consumables in phase 1. MC isn't so difficult that we need to min/max it. Spend that time getting your epic mount instead.
---
So our cat druid will farm MCP for the first few raids in phase 1 and 3 (until those are on farm). Then shit gets real in P5, but eventually that'll be on farm, too.
---
Bro... It's best to stay away from this sub until classic releases.
---
Escape Artist is OP as a Mage. Hamstring? Crippling Poison? No problem! Just Frost Nova + Escape Artist and walk away. You don't even need to Frost Nova if they're already snared by Chill Effect.
---
Arcane Explosion (Rank 1) radius is larger than Perception so there's no point in going Human unless you absolutely can't stand the look of Gnomes. Personally, I think they're [cute as fuck](https://imgur.com/fBDgRVx).
---
If you don't have time to enjoy how the game was meant to be played by interacting with the community then don't bother playing at all and run back to retail.
---
Is it downstairs?
---
¿Que?
---
There might be a couple "take this note to the next town" quests you'd miss out on, but you'd be OK for the most part.
---
Have fun! I’ll be an impossible to kill Alliance Paladin, so see you on the battlefield.
---
I hope the factions arnt as unbalanced as this sub suggests though, seems like everyone is rolling Horde.
---
You kept all that stuff didn’t you.....
---
Hey be careful there’s a guy correcting the spelling of rogue up there.
---
I’m clappin thunder
---
Yeah you're not gonna kick anyone from a group it took you 45m to assemble
---
Retail bad, classic gud daily thread.
---
Reminder that people replying to tickets are outsourced employees with zero knowledge of the game 90% of time and should not be relied on for anything as they often give incorrect/misleading info and have no authority.
---
Because Elwynn is far better than Loch Modan.
---
You realize that m+ exists and that the content there is harder than ever, right? Like yes, basic normal dungeons are easy and boring, but it is not the intended end-game content. If you would go out of your way to let's say try to get the legendary essences skin for dungeons, you'd have to do all of them on +15 difficulty, and I guarantee that the team effort aspects would still be there. Also as a tank for higher m+ I have to check mana quite often. 
---
I hope I won't be too downvoted for defending retail, it definitely has aspects in which it could learn from classic (loot is really boring and the open world experience could be a little harder and more teem focused, along with the leveling experience), but saying that the game is just too easy is completely dishonest.
---
Alright skinner
---
we have more people than 1-15 combined, so there
---
I will use it and I will definitely complain if they break its functionality.  It's inconsistent with what classic was, and people are just using post hoc justification to have something to be outraged about right now.  If blizzard starts going the route of disabling things for no reason other than community outrage they will be going down the road to retail.
---
Im going Human Mage simply because I can't stand looking at a gnome for hours on end.
---
Its not a big enough difference that you won't be invited to raids. Do what you will enjoy! Min-maxing is fun, but everything is viable.
---
Yup :)
---
Man I really wish they had this in podcast form :(
---
I considered it aswell. Ultimately went with Tauren but it was a close call!
---
Hope it’s at least a year away. Can’t wait for some old school 10 man strat &amp; 40 man ZG

BUILD THE GREYMANE WALL
---
Devouring plague, and WotF are both long cool downs,
---
Devouring plague can be removed by several classes, any dwarf, alchemy potions, and world farmable consumables.
---
ShardowGaurd has no cool down, is cheap to cast,  hits like a truck  scales extremely well with gear and proc's black out and gains shadow stacks.
---
Hex, is a curse so only druids and mages can get rid of it, is a 20% mortal strike with no cool down and barely has a mana cost.
---
Regular dungeons are trivial in retail, sure. High level mythic+ and mythic raiding are pretty challenging though.
---
The start of tbc was harder than vanilla. Vanilla was “hard” in that a lot of people had no idea what was going on. If you played with people who knew what was going on you could clear stuff at a decent pace with out having to mark/cc/communicate every pull.
---
Enjoy playing alone :)
---
If you don´t like it, don´t use it. Move on, nothing to see here

Ha, I can relate! I put in my holiday request 1 day after someone else a few months back and they’ve taken the entire week off. To rub it in even more, the Monday is a bank holiday in the UK so I’m not at work when I would normally be, but it doesn’t launch til 11pm and I’m in work the next day at 8 :(
---
I'm operating from the basis of someone making mistakes/poorly itemizing.

Have you ever dealt with a large organization before? The higher ups are very often in the dark, sometimes hilariously so.

If I mention the issue it's also a "test" for the class officer, since he now has to know whether I'm correct or his guildie underling is in the right. If the former, he now has to take action since even Class B knows Class A is making an illegal left onto Fuckup Street. If the latter, well, the class lead tells me to keep my dumbass ideas to myself and focus on my own numbers.
---
Why do they deserve to be banned? Players coming together to achieve a goal is literally the purpose of an MMO.
---
Faction changes does affect everyone else. If a server gets even a slight bias, let's just say horde bias for example, then people will switch factions just to be on the "stronger" side and it'll topple balance out of control. I believe this was the case after server transfers were integrated, people on a slightly unbalanced server switched to either a more balanced one or one where their faction was stronger which not only completely ruined faction balance on their own server but also on the server that they were transferring to.
---
Imagine an entire guild faction changing. That would wreck faction balance on that server.
---
The economy could also get pretty fucked. People could start on the faction with the higher inflation, farm out a bunch of money by selling shit on the AH, and then switching factions with a much lower inflation rate and all of a sudden being like a first class citizen in a 3rd world country.
---
Do you really think Classic devs aren't looking at /r/classicwow?
---
You come around the corner of a tree and there he is. Hogger. He's dominating some poor sap by facesitting him.
---
Well yeah the memes suck, but you can't just delete them for being bad can you?
---
More likely:
---
Then he became a successful guild leader, which took up so much of his time that he quit university and did not become a medical research scientist. Ended up becoming extremely fat and lonely and started minor YouTube channel reviewing Hot Pockets, Energy Drings and all sorts of junk food.
---
The cancer he was destined to cure by 2030 will ravage mankind for another millennium.
---
Just checking here: 
---
So a group needs a tank. Que the endless spam. A random person pops up and says they'll do it. You manually invite them. 
---
Vrs.
---
An addon does all that bit for you. 
---
The only bit of the first part that I can see as being vaguely social is the copy/paste of the spam. The rest is identical.  Everyone is faceless and interchangeable until during/after the run. 
---
This doesn't remove the ability to invite who you want.
---
Yeah... this isn't really news sorry.
---
Dbmarket or the market value is based on a weighted average of the price over the last 14 days. It is not based on the cheapest price, but on a measure of the prce that is roughly around the 15th percentile. It will ignore both very high and very low prices.
---
Mage and warrior is great for aoe pulls. Warrior runs in and grabs everybody, mage frost novas, cone of cold, and arcane explosions until they all die. Brother leveled up to mid 50s on PS doing this with a friend.
---
I don't plan to be using any addons as I think that's a closer experience to Vanilla then using new and improved ones, even if addons did exist back then. Still, if it's allowed, there's not much the community can do to stop you.
---
What comp are you going to be running in RFC? I never considered that dungeoning that early on would be efficient.
---
You’re delusional lmao
---
Bejeweled mostly works in retail still, I bet it also works in Classic
---
\#Lok'tarOmar
---
Any news from them? Would be sick if they both would come back for classic.
---
Is there a source for the picture on the right?
---
I like challenges and think I wouldn’t need much gold for playthru, I don’t plan on tanking going pure dps fury build so wouldn’t need much for repairs( I think?) would u recommend mining and enchanting?
---
Vendorstrike!
---
You run OOM in higher level Mythic and M+ dungeons in Retail and people don't let you stop to drink there, either. You sit for as long as you can while the group runs ahead and hope you can get high enough in mana to survive the next pull and hope they're still alive by the time you get there.

Guys I manage a print shop and made this last night 66"x50". The image is so amazing and 2 of my friends are already yelling at me to make them one too.

i'm just ready to get in game nowwwwww
---
Cared enough to post about it
---
#nochanges
---
Or put the real date up there of 8-27-2019
---
Not really. In a dungeon environment, the tank will be using demo shout. In a raid environment, other warriors should be contributing to sunder stacks.
---
Essentially you have to figure out "how much %hit is equivalent to X spell power?"
---
This value is not static, and will change of course as your gear gets better, as being resisted becomes a larger loss in damage. You will also need %hit to be able to scale your %crit. This is why being a tailor and grabbing the [Bloodvine Set](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=421/bloodvine-garb) is so great for Mages (and Warlocks). But this will not be available until Phase 4.
---
Unfortunately, most of the early gear just won't have much %hit, so you'll want to just take the largest spell damage gear for the most part, as all the BiS lists state. Infra's guide won't steer you wrong!
---
If anyone here is not familiar with the Fortnite Drum Gun unvaulting event - Reddit is a very very small part of any game's community. Don't be surprised if this is the #1 addon for Classic WoW despite all the campaigns you see on Reddit.
---
Changing the material gathering aspect of that gate event would be akin to relocating Mankrik’s wife’s location. Where do you stop altering the original game to compensate for the player knowledge we now posses that didnt exist in 2094-2006? #nochanges is a noble guiding principal. 
---
I was a little disappointed in the skeleton news, but seeing C*NT written in corpses outside every major city aint exactly immersive.
---
? announced for like a week now but ok
---
WE CANT TRUST THE SWORD OF A THOUSAND TRUTHS TO A NOOB!
---
What? I love those too :)
---
That's why I love this place. There are no mobs to kill here, no quests to complete, just peace and quiet.   
---
It used to be the druids main area, one of the few places you could learn your spells and where you'd get your class quests. Now there's no point to come back to it, as you learn your spells automatically, but it will still forever have a special place in my heart.
---
Monday is going to be so slow.
---
Holy shit. Daz good shit. Keep em coming
---
The retail version of this is Opie, and I can't function without it. My question is, does ring menu let you make multiple rings or only one? With Opie I had a profession ring, portals ring, hearthstone ring, consumable ring, toys ring, utility mount ring, etc the list goes on. Obviously my needs for classic will be different, but just curious.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if over a million people turn up and fill all these servers up and they have to open up a couple new ones shortly after launch
---
Gamestop will be the next blockbuster.
---
Pay respect to BFA? Never.
---
You would either have to start at the unbuffed frostbolt max distance (30 yards) instead of 41 yards, or the rotation would have to start with two fireballs before frostbolt.  Unfortunately with the latter option the frost bolt would start casting when the mob is 25 yards, but by the time it's released the mob would already be in your business.
---
For the first option, you would have 8.56 seconds from the time the frostbolt is done casting until the slowed mob travels 25 yards to melee range.  Compare that with 8.53 seconds of cast time you have in the fire log between start casting and the first mob hit.  So similar results on paper without considering the extra frostbolt damage and the clearcasting sacrifice.
---
I try that in the simulator.
---
The newer icons are ugly, but game development is hardly a “sit around and collect a paycheck” type of job.
---
If anything, the industry has quite the opposite reputation (competitive, high turnover, lower pay).
---
All that effort and used the wrong Mograine. Oof.
---
I looked at the patch number originally and not the date. It was 6 weeks after BC launched. Came out January 16th and the nerf was the first week of March. It was still viable up until Sunwell.
---
I’ll be playing both. I still like my 120 holy paladin, but I also want to gank people with my wow classic rogue.
---
Put in my vacation request months ago.
---
It was a highly competitive, big server. I still didn't like it. It's like people think the only reason I dont like Gearscore or RaiderIO is because I've never been high ranked using them or because I am jealous of people higher ranked than I was. That's got nothing to do with it and is an incorrect assumption. I've explained myself to death at this point. I have been there done that at high rating and I still hate the idea of it. Though it's part of retail now, so I get either dealing with it or not playing. That's exactly what I'm choosing, not playing retail. The whole point of Classic is to restrict some of the features that weren't available but now are from being in the game by going back in time before those features existed. If they implement those features to bring aspects of 3rd party add-ons from retail to Classic, then how is it much different from playing retail? How is it being selfish from wanting the game to be like it was when it came out? That's the ENTIRE point of it. A monkey can do most things in Classic and doesn't need to be screened by an add-on. "Are you 60 and have mostly blues and have you ever done this dungeon before?" If answer is yes, invite. Give it a shot. You don't need to chat and have a drink. You can do that during the dungeon. That's how it used to be and how it should be. Bringing add-ons that didn't exist in Classic (like io or gs) is unfair to the idea of Classic itself.
---
Who is this streamer?
---
Decursive and that was about it of course threat meter... But anything else is meh.  Basic ui gets the job done.
---
Sorry you can't enjoy a game without a ton of unnessary clutter.
---
Oh there's already drama galore on /r/Grobbulus. In a way I regret rolling there, but we'll see, I'm sticking with it at least for a while (I'm not an RPer, I just wanted to avoid stupid fucking names like *Lolusuck* or *Retpally*). 
---
I've already forced myself to change factions because of some of the Horde blowhards in the discord. There is also some seriously toxic SJW bullshit going on. My KoS list already has names on it before the game is even released...
---
I'm getting the vibe hes just broke lol
---
Yes leveling does have a claim to being hard. Rank 14 is mind numbingly grinding and so is scarab lord. Stick to retail because you obviously have no idea about classic.
---
You also don't apply a slow and do significantly inferior damage. Double stacking ignites with Shatter wastes one of the ignites, so it's even worse than the low damage of Scorch compared to Frostbolt.
---
Nice reference!
---
They're ripped fortnite animations.
---
Tbh that game has been great for memeing cause of all those decent quality animations.
---
Honestly...no. Nothing in vanilla compares to arenas. Vanilla pvp is fun, but it's arguably a bad "game" in that it's not really fair, balance, or has any overall structure to it.
---
Pretty much, if I were to speculate, I'd guess the majority of people who are "play what you want" when it coems to meme specs are the same guys who were left out of groups because of gs and roi, and now they're (for no reason) scared this addon will do the same, hence their reaction.
---
Couldn't agree more!
---
Boi leave her ass alone and let her play! You both should take off next week because I doubt whatever your company you work for does is more important than Classic
---
Lmao this is gold
---
Why not read what this addon actually does?  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg)
---
Ugh, I love this ageless phrase.
---
"I don't care. Here's how much I don't care:..."
---
Fixed. Ty
---
These surveys need to use check boxes instead of radio buttons in some of these questions. You also need to be able to sort data based on filters.
---
Amazingly, guild raids are usually pre planned and do not involve looking for groups in chat
---
You good haha, once I realized what was happening I thought it was pretty funny
---
This. I've found there aren't many ways to be super efficient with your spell casting to make use of the 5 second rule.  Drinking is just something you have to get used to.
---
On the other hand, you get Mana gems, evocation, and mage armor.
---
Sounds like UK are going Morgraine(Me included) Pyrewood is a normal server so it won't be as popular as all the PvP ones.
---
I'd like to add that on english PvP realm it's against the rules to speak something other than english in general/trade and whatnot. So you won't have an issue regardless of what server you pick.
---
I've tried to play thru some of my large steam list of games, xbox games and everything is just blah, I just want to play classic 😂
---
Well, I've been in the same position.
---
Ever since blizzcon I've been a regular here. Not posting but visiting almost daily.
---
At the beta I started watching more videos and reading a lot more here.
---
I got married 2nd of August and got home from my honeymoon a couple of days ago.
---
Thought being away from games would make me want it more but had the opposite effect.
---
Does it comes with nudes? If you're a guy I demand that you be a powerbottom.
---
The last time Nihilum returned he ditched them during BRF mid-progress. It's something else quitting the guild you are in if progress is over or told them to look for a replacement in advance.
---
Yes attrition rates will be identical, there's zero difference between classic now and original vanilla.
---
Nothing personnel kid
---
No. I do the same with autohotkey
---
Yo can you get me lottery numbers for next week's draw?
---
Ques
---
&gt; It has other redeeming qualities as well, I just picked the objectively good ones.
---
&gt; It also has an accessible storyline, raids with actual challenging mechanics, engaging class rotations and more balanced specs, a rated pvp system, alt-friendly catchup mechanics.
---
&gt; So yeah, the flawed sandwich analogy is still lazy.
---
&gt; I can dismiss classic for having shitty balance, brain dead rotations, super simple boss mechanics, poor itemization and ignore everything that makes it good too....
---
&gt; But it's still lazy
---
It not lazy that's literally just how I feel about the game lol.  Nothing is objectively good about BfA first of all, that's lazy to think that =D
---
Accessible storyline?  You mean just cutscenes left and right making it feel more like a movie than you using your imagination, shit.
---
Raids with challenging mechanics?  Great point!  BfA is shit because it has this constant 'raid or die' mentality to it where the only thing people point to is the raids.  The raids don't even feel rewarding when completing them it's more of a 'oh thank god no one messed up this time' instead of classic where it's more like 'We all spent so much time preparing for this, it feels so good that he is finally dead'.  It's shit.
---
Engaging class rotations.  Lol you have got to be shitting me... you mean the same rotation for every single class except recolored and renamed to fit their class?  Cast 1 and 2 until 3 lights up then you click 3 and then when you get X stacks of Y you press Z.  I guess if you love dance dance revolution or guitar hero, then sure I guess you can find that fun.  It's shit.
---
Balance specs.  I think you mean homogenized specs sweet heart.  Everyone has everything and everyone is just brought for damage or hps and thats it.  No uniqueness allowed in our game.  One class has really good support abilities but does no dps?  Lol gtfo out that nonsense.  It's shit.
---
A rated pvp system.  I will agree I will miss arenas, but not the BfA version.  The system can be fun, but if you game isn't fun, and your classes aren't fun to play then its shit.
---
Alt-friend catchup mechanics... so basically everything that made MMOs, MMOs get thrown away for your convenience and you see that as a plus.  It's shit.
---
So yeah, the sandwich analogy fits perfectly for a lot of people.  I kept trying to tell you how if you enjoy it then that's fine, but now you're just trying to push down everyones throats how good BfA is when we all know it's shit.  AND you're doing this on a classic specific subreddit.  I think this line of logic and thinking is what leads someone to enjoy a game like BfA lol.
---
It's shit.
---
To be honest, i kinda like the idea of the addon. Instead of crawling to messages of 1k people spaming the lfg chat i can esaily find a group. What i dislike would be stuff like gearscore.  
---
I do get that it kinda damages the classic experience, but are you actualy influenced by the addon when you dont use it ?
---
Yet with strange aeons, even death may die.
---
At the same time, in raids, dps warriors PLEASE put a single sunder up yourself. If I or the other tank has to do it themself it will take far too long and we will all lose out on damage or threat.
---
Same
---
I think the Call to Arms addon doesn’t really make things a whole lot easier if it functions as you’ve described. I’m pretty sure that this addon being discussed will spam chat for you, dig through chats cross-layer (I understand this cross-layer business confuses another poster - general chat is confined to your layer, but this addon has the capability to somehow find groups and players posting in general chat in other layers), and notify you of players looking for the groups for the dungeon you’re interested in. It’s a bit more powerful and automated than Call to Arms. It also has an auto-invite feature, and was looking to implement gearscore, but I have heard rumors of that being removed.
---
Sometimes I think I'm really good at figuring things out but then I see something like this and realize I'm just an amateur.
---
I have a question since I started in MoP. Is my pet (hunter) tanking reliable?
---
I know the joke of turn off growl, but is it legitimate to ask the tank if he wants my pet to take some damage so he doesn't get as low?
---
Fingers crossed
---
I see. Truth be told I have limited experience with it. I'll be giving it a go this time around in classic though as a second in command. I appreciate the candid response, definitely gives me something to think about and look forward to. Hopefully I find managing that kind of thing fun rather than a huge chore and grating.
---
&gt;Ahem. Like I also pointed out. ALL 5-10 man pre-raid content can be cleared no problem by anyone with even the most basic level 60 gear.
---
You do realize the point of GS type addons is so they can do the content quicker? Instead of picking randoms that would take 4 hours to clear UBRS, you are picky with their level of gear and clear it in 2 instead.
---
Agreed :)
---
PvP improved with arenas, can't really argue that. The only argument for PvP in vanilla is actual world PvP being a thing. However, your friend may prefer the structure of arenas over the chaos that world PvP or vanilla BG's could be which is fine.
---
Bossmods were a thing in early vanilla, we were using them in literally my first raid (1.3? i think? Dire Maul Patch)
---
I think these are the servers that are going to attract most of the "I'm just going to try it out" people who will play classic.
---
Tourism is going to ruin classic.
---
I’ll give the /wave and honor it unless another of my faction comes to kill them... then I’ll just throw a dagger to get a little piece of the pie.
---
lol, look at your post history pls, you are a giant toxic piece of shit, dunno how badly damaged is your brain for you to create this post with the shit you say
---
Yeah they can always do that it's really easy and has like no downsides amirite?

Also another con, likelyhood of getting scarab lord: Extremely Low.
---
Heard it in her cute voice too. Thanks for that.
---
In just that one word, you're already learning a bit about the player. No hello, no hey, no please. Just "inv" ... so you invite him. Does he start talking or is he just a silent healer? You make a mental note. 
---
It's an icebreaker. It's a way to say hello. It's socializing 101.
---
&gt; Small. No
---
It’s super small compared to the retail client.

Classic is there to keep you subbed while retail has content droughts basically.
---
that good info thanks!
---
I'm totally ok with server transfers and race changes.
---
New pets and mounts? Nonononono
---
I don't care if people use this tool or not it not my place to say that a them issue honestly
---
with this tool or not people that are assholes will be blacklisted on the realm and not partied with. and it still with in the same realm and it not like you can do classic dungeons with out talking because of CC and all that 
---
let people decide for themselves because you don't like something doesn't mean somebody else cant have it
---
I was looking into that weapon... It has a 33% to drop from what I've seen/remember. So to get 5 you would need to lock out the dungeon for a solid 3 hours. This dungeon is a difficult area for horde to access, so you can't really go anywhere during down time. 
---
This sounds bad until you realize you can play an alt during down time to  farm for other raid mats.
---
The North remembers.
---
that describes most changes to WoW in general
---
Highlord Saurfang!
---
It can't become a requirement.  Literally that's impossible.  The way it functions will never make it a required mod because it pulls messages from the lfg channel.
---
Lakeshire in Redridge when I’m playing Alliance.  Lakeshire because it’s there that I actually knew I was gonna be in the game longer than any other game and because it’s quests and grinding spots are so efficient.
---
For Horde characters it’s gotta be the Barrens, just such an amazing zone
---
Thanks for that
---
Talking with my hunter friend and we were wondering if there's anything that reduce the chance to have a freezing trap being resisted except that one talent?
---
Most things an engineer makes can only be used by another engineer. You won't be able to use anything your friend makes (except for EZ throw dynamite).
---
Mods gave up because 500000 of these posts get made every day and removing them is a full time job and the community loves them anyway because it helps them stay in denial about actual player numbers
---
24 and 39
---
This is something I'd expect to see on r/wowcirclejerk
---
How silly
---
Paying for a product is not a "wound" buddy
---
I just don't understand why they'd bother to respond, then.  It comes off as an official response despite not actually having any meaning.
---
I get what you're saying, but I don't foresee people just sticking to 1 community. Also, discord isn't for everyone.
---
C'mon. That would require eyes, fingers, and time which OP definitely doesn't have!
---
Glider and extended scripting macros were not addons, and were nerfed / broken during vanilla. the addons i am discussing were not broken during vanilla.
---
therefore, i would have issue if blizzard went back to the 1.01 macro system, or allowed glider like programs in classic.
---
but addons that do the same thing as addons that existed in vanilla are, imo, fine.
---
Correct, I was just trying to be more specific than just using "game". Google, "Cross-realms killed Wow" and you'll still get tons of rants.
---
RPG elements back, world actually matter. Balancing and homogenizing classes as if you are supposed to play an esport game should cease.
---
Free epics removed, attunements being brought back, content not being invalidated every 3 months. In short, a 180 degree turn on design, that would get us back atleast to Pre-ToC/IC WotlK era. Which doesn't mean that these raids shouldn't exist, but it was the beginning of the end.
---
That said, IMO vanilla was the best WoW ever was. Big relevant world, filled with RPG elements and wacky mechanics. Actual community instead of automated boredom. No CRZ and sharding of any kind. I can go on forever TBH, but you probably get the picture.
---
If a day comes that we see WoW 2, then i hope blizzard will put the game first, and Activision's unmatched greed second, or in fact straight to the trashcan.
---
I'm actively defending the addon because if it's not banned it will improve my classic experience. 
---
Good players will group with good players and people who have a problem with being called a turboshitter can play with all of the other turboshitters.
---
It's about 15 mins for me, idk I grew up poor af so I guess I'm just more conservative with my money (which is why I said it's probably a me thing)
---
Man if I thought a broken foot would let me have two weeks off I would be tempted to grab my sledge hammer. Sadly a broken foot wouldn't stop my desk job or my three year old. Enjoy it while you can.
---
Eyyy, I'm planning to afk skill while leveling too
---
Lol I hear ya. For me, only maybe 2 guys are not computer people but they work in helpdesk. It’s just strange. Like I get that no one truly has a passion for rebuilding outlook profiles or running updates on servers, but compared to the guys on my team who are building homelabs, plex/Usenet servers, playing online CTFs and Hack the Box, hacking ROMs and writing silly python scripts to annoy their coworkers, it just makes you wonder what Bill is doing where he doesn’t even play games, much less be interested enough in tech to try to break stuff or make stuff. 
---
It certainly confuses me. I mean, to each his own. For instance, I have absolutely zero interest in finance or business, which is fine since I don’t spend 8 hours a day doing that kind of stuff...
---
Oh barov servant caller trinket I believe.
---
You don't need dire maul gear if you get aged core leather gloves from molten core for +5 dagger skill. You get the other 5 from talents, 310 allows your glancing blows to do full damage.
---
You cleary didn’t play wow for more than a month . Let me remind you: gear score, oqueue, legendary cloak, legendary ring.... etc
---
I wouldn't say dense, just like most of the non-programmer population they have no-clue about what is easy or hard to code.
---
And yeah, I use a DB of items because that's really straightforward to understand for most people, stat ponderation tend to get people stuck into the details of stat weight computation (that's trivial).
---
A lot of people don't want a GS addon for a variety of reason. It's understandable but in all likelyhood, it will exist and it will be used. Why ? Because there's gonna be a huge power imbalance between  :
---
- Tank/healer group leader

- Overgeared group who goes for a roflstomp run
---
As soon as these people start to get bad experience with pugs, they will always fall back to the easy metric that allow for the safer bet, ie gear. 
---
And the alternative is raider.io (lesser of 2 evils imo) which is basically how many time did you run something.
---
The funny thing is we all do it even without addon. It's just call staying dead silent when that dumbass hunter who always asspull /  need to be carried, asks in gchat for a group.
---
It's perfect cause it gives you just enough time to /lol and /bye
---
Kinda agree. I don't even care if people steal my name, but they likely won't. My brother and friends names are all probably safe too. It's people who have like "Dave" or some shit that are obsessed with reserving their name.
---
Blow me, blue meow, blue moo, the memes are already here. We just need the pop to match.
---
You know that a mafia that blacklists, harasses, and engages in crossfaction targeted blacklisting is kinda experience breaking for me personally.
---
Fucking get here already!!!!
---
So much this. I had planned on rolling an alliance druid but I keep thinking maybe I should just go mage but if I do that I would roll forsaken. It may come down to a coin toss
---
[Maybe...](https://i.imgur.com/XuSNtvU.png)
---
YES I mean why do you even need to make this thread again, you already know what the answer is if you read the other threads
---
What spec is recomended for dungeon leveling? The group is a mix, im the only mage. My instinct was frost for cc, but since we wont really be kiting should I go fire?

They control the API, they define what an addon can or cannot do.
---
They can't ban a certain addon, but they can alter their API that defines what an addon can do.
---
If they wanted to they could allow addons to control your character for you, but they don't want that.  
---
It's just up to them where they draw the line as to what an addon can control.

Thank god he wore his red shirt.

If you’re trying to argue actual logic here by saying you won’t have a meaningful relationship with a girl that doesn’t play WoW, you’re not getting your point across at all, the only thing you are getting across is that the only important thing to you is WoW and you don’t have perspective on anything else. Especially how relationships work.
---
To simulate the low fps back in the day dude
---
Big true
---
you can't bring back vanilla's culture unchanged because it was inexorably linked to the topology of the internet which is vastly different today.
---
people did things suboptimally in vanilla because they weren't even aware that there was a better way.
---
If your friend is only into ranks and stats, then you probably won't sway him from arenas. 
---
PvP in vanilla was a fame or infamy thing that got around through word of mouth through your server. Maybe you could argue that being well known in classic will be easier if you are a stand out player though, especially since your gear will be a huge "do not mess with me" indicator.
---
I agree it’s not as bad as retail (I may have mentioned that in the post). But it just makes finding replacements *easier*. Not effortless, just easier. The difference between having LfG chat and having this addon, is that this addon will a) spam lfg chat for you and b) search lfg chat and other chats for replacements or additionals for your group, and notify you.
---
I like Esfand. The reason i never watch the stream is because TipsOut. I really do not like that guy. Something about him just rubs me the wrong way.
---
I see, from what I am gathering 1h/shield prot warrior sounds awesome, the only reason I am hesitant is that prior experiences in MMO's with 1h/shield roles is that it's boring and mundane, with not many cool skills and a huge lack of damage, I don't know how that translates in WoW though, is 1h/shield proc warrior any decent at doing damage or is my only purpose to sit in front of a boss and just wait until my friends kill it?
---
His post reads just fine.  You sound incredibly bitter. Maybe time for a nap?
---
Yes, that makes raiding in a short time frame hard, not leveling. I can see your frustrated so I'll help you out here but it's 55.
---
Depends how filthy casual you are.
---
Once hitting 60 it will take about 30-40 hours of gameplay to get dungeon gear and attunements.  And after that you are essentially ready to raid MC,BWL(if out),onyxia,ZG(If out) and AQ20(if out). 
---
For a casual player playing with casual players, it will probably take onyxia around 2-3 hours but can be signficantly shortend once you do it a couple of times, and MC a full evening (3ish hours), BWL 2 evenings(even if you even complete it by then, it's kinda hard for newer players), ZG around 2-3 hours, and AQ20 around 2 hours.
---
Expect to spend about the same time getting ready for each raid as the raid itself takes.
---
So if you want to be in a mc/onyxia raiding guild taking 2 week nights to clear per week, you will need around 6 hours per week to get ready as well totaling 12 hours per week for duration of you want to farm mc/onyxia. The gold farming time can be done whenenver but the raiding obviously is done at strict times.
---
So yeah even a casual player can at least enjoy mc/aq20/zg/onyxia and maybe even some BWL.
---
Then play ot how you want. Dont try to control how others play.
---
Did you forget to take your medicine this morning?
---
Healer's wisdom is much appreciated.
---
These are absolutely legendary and I can’t wait for more
---
its full of casuals but its extremely toxic. i also don't miss the wsb days.
---
Thanks to everyone trying out my guide :) I am currently making sure all will be fine for launch, now just blizzard has to deliver..... :S #worried
---
All it does is help you find the group.  The people will still be on your server.  You will still have to run to the dungeons, and you will still garner a reputation because you will see that person again and again.
---
The people ranting about this addon are absolute mouth breathing retards.  its not going to ruin vanilla and its NOTHING like the LFG on retail.  It LITERALLY just helps you form a group with people that would otherwise be spamming "LFG DM".
---
These people are having their immersion ruined because instead of going LFG or LFM X an addon is helping with it.  NOTHING else changes, you still have to do all the other old school things that the dungeon requres.
---
People on this sub are reactionary sheep so damn often.
---
This helps a ton, thank you!!
---
And time the climaxes together with characters level ups!
---
Didn't he say.

Odd groups got right, even groups got left.

Dal'Rend is a perfect case of theoretical BIS versus practical BIS. Sure you'll get slightly more dps out of the DR set, but good luck ever getting it before raiding since you will be rolling against an endless stream of rogues and warriors.
---
It kinda does though
---
It was in Vanilla, just not on PVP servers.  That's how it is in Classic as well.
---
Are you the Maugrim from the 50 DKP minus video??
---
Cons: streamer server
---
To be fair, they've done a lot of studies, and by 2pm most people have tuned out their work and are thinking of other things. Think about all the shopping lists that get written out at work! :')
---
Retail is gonna be more popular than classic, Sorry to say. Classic's main purpose is to bring back subs and basically give you something to do while retail has content drought.
---
When you are full naxx gear are you telling me you will keep raiding for the next 10 years? That 1 raid over and over?
---
Anybody who uses ilvl in vanilla just doesn't understand the gearing. What matters is being hit capped, defense capped, etc. But more importantly the game is pretty casual and if your gear isn't dogshit and you can play the game, you'll be just fine.
---
I personally think arenas are terrible and unbalanced and one of the most boring ways to handle PvP in an MMO. Still, if that's what resonates with him, then I'm not sure how you'll pull him to Classic, being that there aren't any arenas to play in. 
---
The only thing I'd say you can mention in the fact that battlegrounds and world PvP are so much more intimate and fulfilling in Classic. Killing someone can have a huge impact on their day (economically, if not emotionally) and people are so much more ready to engage in WPvP then in Retail. 
---
Classic won't have the constant action that insta-teleport arenas offer in Retail, but if he's willing to stick it out, I think he'll find PvP more fulfilling in Classic, and worth the wait.
---
Only on PvE servers.
---
Have you ever thought of becoming the Chad Warrior, and dominating your friend into heal slut submission?
---
Oh you mean the 10 daily "memes" that boil down to retail bad hatejerk or thinly veiled nochanges whining? Definitely makes the community seem welcoming
---
Takes off work monday and tuesday to play wow. 48hr que time. Rip.
---
We will definitely see these add-ons unless they are banned. The good thing is that you will still have plenty of people not using them since they are not built into the game like they are in retail.
---
I'm doing this! Made a little list of body weight exercises to do when you have down time :)
---
The trick is to have a completely unique name so it never mattered where my guild decided on
---
Bahaha, half of the nobrainer arguments gone.
---
I'm just sad this won't stop the crybabies. Hopefully Blizz sees that there are two sides to this coin and the for-lfg-addon side doesn't care if **you** think it's somehow ruining the 'authentic experience' for **you** because **other people** want to make dungeon groups in less tedious and simpler way than having to manually spam a chat.
---
Remember fellas, TRADE CHAT has most-always been the best place to LFM/LFG even when there's a dedicated channel for LFG.
---
TRADE CHAT. TRADE.
---
Yeah, this addon doesn't help stop TRADE CHAT spam, but neither does removing it. It helps the people.
---
Actually, if there wasn't so much nonsensical hatred/dislike going on right now, the lfg addon could've mainly used addon-chats *instead* of the trade chat. Now it *has* to use chats because otherwise you would be going *"but if the addon never posts to chat a lot of people won't find a group!"*. Think about it. Now think a little more about it.
---
Yeah, **you guys literally made trade chat worse by complaining about the lfg addon**. Thanks idiots.
---
You blame Blizzard but it’s Activision.
---
People don’t understand that literally every realm will be full on monday. The only time this will be a problem is 6 months to a year in the future. We cannot see the realms pop in the future
---
mining should be fine since layering.
---
I agree this is a good mitigating factor, but why take the risk of allowing the implementation of a tool that makes it any easier than it was in Vanilla? Who knows what the threshold is that makes the magic die?
---
That is an impressive level of contrarianism.
---
Actually impressive. No joke.
---
But yeah, I don't mind defending some aspects of BfA in this subreddit. It results in gold like your comment, it's very interesting to see the magnitude of hate boner for BfA.
---
I just hope I don't end up grouping with types like you. Guess my criticisms of vanilla really got to you 😭
---
Your a 4 year old account with 100 and odd karma, actively seeking LFG addon posts.
---
You're personally involved. Don't give me such nonsense and please, for christ sake, please realise your "turboshitters" comment hits it right out the park on a scale of 1-Emo's Dancing under a bridge.
---
I think this conversation has convinced me to make more sexist jokes in the live game than I otherwise would've.
---
Cool.  People getting mad about this addon are getting so angry and bent out of shape.  Really acting like children.  It's pretty funny that you'd allow yourself to froth at the mouth about something so minor.
---
Classic (especially so) and even TBC is extremely friendly to casual raiders, as you could take breaks, come back, and pick up where you left off. In retail you either play when the raid tier is current, or you miss out, and here's why from a different post:
---
" 
---
Catch up is the big issue for me, I don't mind some level of catch up mechanics, but each tier makes all previous content obsolete in an expansion, which just sucks. I like having to progress and see the content, not just the new raid.
---
I took a break after Vanilla and came back when BT was out in TBC. I saw all of the raids in progression with slower guilds up through a portion of BT, and missed Sunwell. I had seen Gruul, Mag, Kara, TK, SCC, BT, and even did some trash farming in Sunwell. (Oh, I forgot ZA, that was fun too, it was out when I came back as well).
---
On the other hand after leaving in Wotlk, and coming back in MoP, my progression was as follows: LFR SOO -&gt; Flex SOO -&gt; Normal SOO - Heroic SOO (later to be called mythic). Sure SOO was fun, but I never got to see all of the other raids outside of afking in LFR in them and my experience was completely based on SOO. That sucked.
---
Same thing happened in WoD, we were progressing in Mythic Highmaul when BRF came out, so we stopped doing Highmaul altogether and moved to BRF. There was no reason at all to do Highmaul anymore, and it was a fun raid, but we never killed Margok mythic. I just hate this model of "only the current raid matters.""
---
All depends how seriously you're gonna take it. The important thing is being able to objectively know what kind of players you and your core group are, and being honest about that in your recruitment.
---
If you want smooth runs where bosses are downed and loot is had and you knock it out in one good session, then you want a relatively optimized raid with players that want to contribute to that goal. Progression runs are only that in name, the content is finished and these simple boss mechanics and low gear checks stand in the way of purples. We all have better things to do with our time than listen to the raid leader explain the Nefarion mechanics for the 8th time.
---
If you want to be able to give Shadow a try this week and ask your Feral to heal this time because you're bored and even though you havent gotten past Chromaggus yet the game is really about fun and whether you go optimally or not your coraiders are going to just do their thing too and you more than likely wont kill Chromaggus this time either, so why not have some fun on Discord with your buds and look at some Shadow numbers? Awesome, find some people you enjoy having conversations with and go from there; as long as your goals align you won't have any issues.
---
The key is to be honest about where you and your core fall.
---
I'm a man, weeeeeeee!
---
There’s also this to consider, plus the addon advertises capability of communicating in general chats cross-layer.
---
Low IQ, I see.
---
And spam click it just for good luck
---
I appreciate the comprehensive reply. This answers a lot of the questions that I wasn't able to properly word. I used to be a really social person back during the original vanilla, but since then I've become pretty shy and introverted in-game. I think the social aspects of being a Mage is going to help me open up again, and I'm actually looking forward to hooking people up as much as I can. Plus I've spent most of my years as a tank, and while I am proud of how well I can do it, it will be nice to run instances again with a little less pressure. DPS and CC is going to be a breath of fresh air.
---
What sever are you going to be playing on?
---
It was so in Vanilla. The rules are different for PvE vs PvP servers.
---
100% this, there are blues that can be BiS till late in the endgame, ilvl isn't everything
---
&gt; Druid is the strongest 1v1
---
AP+ToEP+ZHC+PoM+Pyro would like to have a word with you.
---
Cartels have always controlled the market. This is an integral part of vanilla WoW.
---
Everyone coming back YEEEEAAAY
---
I believe it's mainly about getting away from an area that might disconnect you.
---
Yeah it’s pretty disappointing. I guess not surprising either
---
First time I walked into SW, I got lost in the canals. I didn’t know about the map so I got stuck and upset because I thought this was it for my character...
---
I eventually got into the old town and got killed by two defias (I think?) that popped for someone’s quest. I was so scared!!!
---
I can not wait to relive all of that
---
&gt;Stranglethorn white gorilla sinew/tendon
---

---
cya
---
Oh... It's that guy again. Okay.
---
This is me, too. We planted an insane amount of trees by hand earlier this year (like over a thousand), so I'm going out today and tomorrow to stake them to make them easier to find. I wanna get it out of the way cause I told my husband I'll be too busy to do it next weekend! ;P
---
Pushing yourself hit level 60 in two weeks isn't hard? If you think that's easy then quit responding to me retail baby. You clearly have no clue what you are talking about and your little "54 to 55" comment makes you sound dumb and assures me you have no real argument and are a troll.
---
I didn't repeat a single name from Vanilla. Different names, different characters.
---
I think it's the same solution and doesnt even matter
---
Prot won't increase your survivability as much as you think
---
Indeed frost pve/pvp is very different. 
---
SM/Ruin Warlock is up there for the best choice.
---
I was hoping the doc said I was going to need knee surgery and I would be out for a couple weeks but instead he said to just do some at home therapy.
---
There will be weekend pugs for MC and BWL  but not aq40 or naxx
---
Oh no, I'm not doing your home work for you. You're allowed to be stupid. I'm ok with it.
---
Nice. You could have spelled it HoT for the dumbasses like me that took a minute to get it
---
They probably won't shut it down, the same apis existed in classic so there aren't any changes here
---
&gt; these addons existed for vanilla wow too. not sure why its bad now all of a sudden
---
Because most of the people here either didn't play vanilla, don't understand what the addon actually does, or were 7 when vanilla was out.  Take your pick and it describes 99% of this sub.
---
This addon won't change anything except that instead of pasting "LFM X" or "LFG X" over and over you can use an addon to help you find the people.  You still have to talk to them, you still have to travel to the dungeon together, and they are still on your server.  it literally changes almost nothing, but people on this sub are braindead when it comes to this kind of stuff and just want to rant and whine.
---
Whoever creates that addon will forever be caught in the LFR in BFA when he dies and always wiping on 2%
---
hah, same strip with more toucans in POE sub today
---
I always wanted to be Undead because they were so cool, but not pretty enough lol. I was thinking Undead Priest this time around though.
---
gold sellers called and said hello
---
Genuine question: why is he a scammer?
---
The game is going to be the way it was in classic so on PvE you can do whatever you want. PVP u can’t
---
Tbh all the classes have a high skill ceiling in pvp
---
Dream well old druid.
---
Or a standard interface will be developed, that will not only allow different addons to interact but people to interact by using proper syntax. Making it easier indirectly as well to tell the difference between LFG and unrelated chatter depending on what you are looking for.
---
Hi, /u/-ShagginTurtles-

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cugx54/do_warlocks_in_classic_have_the_option_to/). 
---
I played Night Elf because I thought she was the ugliest. Short hair, facial tattoos...  Figured not a lot of people were into the punk look.
---
Plan on rolling Night Elf again because I'm playing Druid, also because like the punk look.
---
Uhhhhh cata had the worst phasing, we've had phasing since wrath. Cata had it really bad because the questlines were all on rails so thing would change as you progressed and if your friend wasnt at the same quest as you you literally wouldnt see each other in the same spot. 
---
I mean I like cata but I'm not going forget the worst parts of it to make some nebulous point if what was better. Let's not forget also how bad balance was on release. Pvp and pve saw some specs dead in the water and others overwhelmingly broken.
---
Also why hate on lfr?
---
So, what is the point of the add-on if it just changes how it visually represents messages?
---
You don't *need* add-ons, but some of them are certainly helpful in various ways.
---
DBM (or BigWigs) for anyone who's into raiding is pretty much mandatory.
---
Other than that, it's mostly about making your life easier by either improving the UI, or providing information that as a new player, you'll definitely find more useful than players who have been playing for over a decade...
---
NICE
---
Yeah the only time I'll pass on an upgrade is if I'm with friends, guildies, or it's like bis for the other person and only a decent item for me. Other than that, if it's an upgrade, I need it.
---
oof. That one even hurts to hear. Good thing is newer windows versions (ie 10) picks the right resolution because of better display driver support and device detection.
---
Lmao, i spun the wheel for fun and got resto shaman. I was planning on playing shaman since all 3 specs are fun and great in my opinion but going resto for raiding was already my plan unless i can get away with nightfall/totem twisting as enh.
---
And some people are just boring and have trash opinions. Like you.
---
Next.
---
I honestly feel like a very small minority of people will use this
---
No? and yes i did lol chill with your r/gatekeeping
---
Half you say? Perfectly balanced.
---
Depends on the group composition. I have heard of a 4 mage group using x2 frost x2 arcane. I would default to frost however.
---
Boss mods telling you what to do in real time during a boss fight also destroy the game and don’t feel Vanilla. In Vanilla folks had to learn an encounter by experience and by having others teach and prepare you.
---
You can't play. They banned you.  /s
---
Figured you didn't have any dignity so why hold it over you, I mean, you think leveling is hard. Probably think that doing the dishes is hard. Oh no a repetitive task that is not taxing in any way and is merely time consuming! This is sooooo hard! Retail is so easy even though I have no idea how mythic azshara works.
---
My best friend was a Gnome Rogue. We merked arenas on our server. Rogues are always a solid choice
---
Which is why I mentioned it as a different function
---
And i'm sure many a priest have banged tiny little asian boys
---
I mean, LFG/LFR is one of the things people blame for the downfall of the social aspects in the current game so I can see the pushback. Certain addons effectively make it so you can break most aspects of the game and in a game with competition whomever is willing to go the farthest will win and win big. People don’t want to have to give up what they want from classic to be able to have a fun time.

Some of the biggest arena players  (some of which never played classic until the beta) are going all in for classic.  Sure there are no arenas but the competitive aspect transfers well

I don’t think 4 days counts as “right back”

Is that really what they look like now? The undead in particular looks like a joke.

I've had this video saved over 10 years, transferred from hard drive to hard drive.  It's still one of my favorites.
---
Lame
---
&gt; The second option may work if the opening sequence is fireball, scorch, frostbolt
---
Scorch instantly hits the target and would start moving the mob towards you.  I don't think it would be beneficial to lead off combat with it when you could have more damage 'on its way' so to speak.
---
Yup, I would tell you 100% avoid quest addons at all costs. Exploring the world is half the fun for your first run through imo 
---
(A quest addon marks exactly where to go with a one line summary of what needs to be done - no need to read quest text)
---
Fairbanks, baby!
---
Yeah, this goes into a point I had about the difference between having this addon and not. This addon allows you to draw on pools of people who don’t have global chats open due to the spaminess of them.
---
People on this sub like to tell you that if you're not the right class/race combination, or that if you're a casual player, that you'll never get to raid. The reality is that Vanilla raids are the easiest out of any expansion, and that with full servers there will be plenty of groups looking for any warm body they can get to clear content - especially if it's a tier behind and they're just trying to catch up new members. Absolutely don't worry about getting to raid - you won't be in a realm first group, but you'll find one.
---
Or the standardized format of your "LFM" message

Benediction quest :)
---
Real Horde ladies play Tauren female cause they've got a cute swishy tail. &lt;3
---
Ok, in seriousness though, I assume most ~~shallow~~ discerning females prefer pretty races. Since there are no blood elves now, most will play Alliance (but probably not dwarves).  I look forward to war stomping many of them.
---
I don't think he took credit as he didn't put anywhere on the title or picture that it's his picture, he simply just saw it and uploaded it here.. people do it every day with OC content, nothing new
---
Always played mage so it was not luck for me, but I saw both warglaive drop in a single drop... we gave them to our most dedicated player a rogue.
---
It's an older meme sir, but it checks out.
---
Feedback is useful discussion and observation, not this toxic crying thats been going on lol..
---
Interesting format but those images were funny to see after reading the story 😂
---
If you want to get around that problem then roll horde. Then hunters will pick up Rune of the Guard Captain + Blackhand's Breadth and you won't have to worry about your HoJ being needed by us.
---
The auto invite won't differentiate between a Druid, Paladin or Warrior or even the level. When it's not auto invite you would 
---
1) shift click their name to see if they are even appropriate for the role.
---
2) See what class and spec they are as well as level.
---
3) You would actually talk to them.
---
vs
---
1) auto invite and you literally play the fucking lottery with any jackass who joins.
---
How can you even argue it's the same? It's so fundamentally different
---
Time for some green dreams.
---
Actually I'm pretty sure Trolls are best? Maybe for Fury the best weapons are axes but at least for tanking Trolls are better
---
Essentially yeah, people can complain about grinding but in the end its not the grind that is turning people away, its a meaningful grind and progression that makes you feel evermore powerful. 
---
The reason why end game tier sets are so prestigious is because of how shit the rest of the game makes us look, there is an incentive to get better at the game other than "mah skills".
---
The grind on live is soulless, in Vanilla it will be meaningful.
---
Are you trying to advertise for the addon??
---
That sounds amazing. You don't have to keep going with deadweight in a dungeon and can instead bring in someone willing to actually put any effort into it?
---
Seriously go watch a video on what it does. It automates invites and you are just disregarding it to support your argument. Those two other things I mentioned are currently in developement by the addon creator. Do some research before telling someone they dont know what they are talking about in such a hostile manner. 
---
This will negatively impact the culture of the game since it will become massively widespread unlike it did in vanilla it existed in classic but only to a select group of people as addons were not as widespread and easily available. Blizzard has came out and said things that impact the culture of the game in this manner are against their vision for the game.  This is catering to those who want LFG based systems from retail. 
---
The initial contact is very chat spammy but almost always some sort of interaction prior to invites. A addon that automates a proccess in the game is something blizzard is against this does exactly that. 
---
My first statement about you presenting a condescending argument still stands. It just further pushes away from your views. 
---
If this addon removed the projected future automation developments and the auto invite and group invitation it would be fine in my eyes. But currently it is being marketed as a "chat parser" when it has more functionality besides that.
---
**if** we’re doing a wish list, maybe filling out the places that were incomplete in Vanilla (like Mt. Hyjal). I want it to be a level 60 zone that even geared level 60’s have to be careful in, due to the difficulty. **I want Blizzard to make sure they make quest items that are good and/or quirky. I don’t want them to be better than Naxx gear, but maybe like MC-BWLish.**
---
No quest addons maybe. I definitely had a few during vanilla. Though I think most were fairly benign things like item search/auto link, and eventually a dps meter for raiding.
---
When you go to a calendar, do you open up to the 15ths and then find June?

Or do you open up to June, and then find the 15th?

K. Want a cookie?
---
Bottom left is a road sign saying “Assen-Noord” which is indeed in the Netherlands so good guess buddy!

That goal is specifically banning the functions that should not be in the game. If other addons use those, then they should not be in the game.

If you’re not going a female Tauren then you’re a fraud I’m just gonna leave that there
---
Even in modern wow higher item lvl doesn't mean that it's better, it's a popular topic to complain about
---
It's p2w and it makes people mad... which is exactly why I plan on doing it.
---
Ya the "can't" in there should probably just a "won't". They lack willingness not ability.

He litterally said ”thank you” when i gave him credit for making it
---
&gt;All ClassicLFG has to do is stop auto invites and always add chat messages.
---
This is what it does. The classic version doesn't support auto invite and it uses the main channels trade and lfg.
---
Thing is, there are a bunch of specs that people think are the most fun they have ever been. (Like disc priest - which is not an excellent example since they probably are the most "priest class" spec, than the exclusionary holy magic and shadow magic specs) - so reverting back is something they are probably very weary of.
---
Well people say it falls short of 2-3 levels before 40, wasn't that the case?
---
Oh shit, and it's the weekend. How are they gonna fix it by launch?! :(
---
You can OT any raid.   Yeah, trash OT.  We didn’t get to a naxx boss, because TBC.  I tanked boss fights that had adds, or multiple bosses like the bug family in aq40.   
---
I’m not really aiming for Ret until I’ve got my Sulfuras, so years, or maybe never.  
---
I’m going to be holy mostly, but I’m really hoping I can get all 3 specs mastered before I stop playing.
---
Because typing LFM BRD isn't a soulless act.
---
I doubt it too. Fact is, the modern mmo audience dorsnt want a game like classic, they want something like legion or ffxiv or gw2. They're just not posting on reddit so you can hear about it so people forget they exist and make these pointless comparisons.
---
In pvp absolutely. In pve, it goes from bear tanking, which is dead-ass simple, to powershifting cat, which is likely the most involved spec in the game, both in terms of knowledge, actions per minute, and raid prep.
---
I'm aware of what it is. I just don't want it.
---
I remember being a squeaker in wow, in the days of old, times when you had to run to the zone and queue for WSG. Over vent I announced " I'm almost there to queue up (pronounced it like kway)" That day i learned something.
---
Yeah but you can have someone else make you cloth gear and bags by just providing mats. I think I’ll get more engineering
---
Idk, those I know who have crashed when shitfaced has survived, those who have been sober has not
---
When it comes to AV any spec seems good. Used to take my pve hunter into AV with marksman spec. No issues.
---
Vanilla mages in Wsg were commonly doing the arcane power with pom/Pyro 2 shot build to blow up flag carriers.
---
they already released a trailer.
---
Avengers endgame
---
He isn't elite, he's just a level 12 neutral mob. He's there for rogues to pickpocket for a class quest but of course everyone 10 and over can easily kill him so he is dead...a lot
---
I only ever played PvP servers, so I didn't know that.
---
New form out with new servers but it was like 45/55
---
Legit question that just occurred to me: How do you vet players for groups? I'm definitely not an iLvl reliance guy, but it's been so long since I had to manually put together a group of stranger I don't recall how we used to do this? The Armory?
---
Epic Avengers ending music 🤣
---
&gt;no one invites DPS warriors to their group
---
First I've heard of this /shrug
---
Sure, but I don’t want to do anything other than play classic right now. It just sucks that my fix is so toxic.
---
Ugh, I would be so jealous.  Though, if I had access to it at work, I wouldn't get any work done.  RIP.
---
If you don't have any other commitments, sleep in as long as you can Monday. It will speed up the first part of the day!
---
It doesn't need to matchmake, auto-invite and creating a private grouping network within the game is bad enough.
---
23 vanilla, 37 now
---
First Monday in history where millions can't wait to come.
---
Interesting.
---
Sure thing. Yup one ring will be enough to rule them all.. in Classic.
---
It's not my explanation, there literally isn't one for why the US formats the date how they do.  But you yourself use a calendar in the Month/Date format.  And then you write it Date/Month, after searching it the opposite.
---
u sure about that
---
It would’ve been better if this addon was never developed, but I’ll settle for Blizzard breaking it.
---
The cheapest gift of all.
---
I’m German so I get the direct middle. Midnight between Monday and Tuesday. Everyone on the left of the map should have Classic on late Monday
---
I only ever played RGB'S and arenas in wow, i played since Wrath and i never raided once... But i feel like classic is bringing me the opportunity to see what raiding/pve is like
---
Holy shit. This Copperfield reference took me the fuck back. As a gnome on Shattered Hand, I enjoyed it.
---
You're right, it is demonology. My memory is not serving me today.
---
? It doesn't auto q. You have to whisper the individual just like you normally do if you want to join a group. As of 3 days ago there is no automatchmaking. I even bolded it in the post.
---
Oof. Low effort meme, please remove.
---
How do you manage if you get stuck in a queue for hours?  Do you jump servers or wait for the next day and hope the queue is smaller?  Everyone is stuck in assuming that they will get in and not be delayed by queues.  If you aren't one of the first on the server, your odds of getting a server first 60 go wayyyyy down.
---
Life is a dick.
---
On that day, all the murlocs in Azeroth disappeared.
---
As the developer of one of the two major RP addons (TRP3) I am really scared by this. I cannot see technically how they could break an LFG addon without breaking addons communications for ALL addons (DBM, DPS meters, RP addons). As long as there is a way for addons to communicate (via addon data messages or even text messages), LFG systems will be possible. Back in MoP, oQueue used to send actual whisper messages to people in your friends list with it’s addon data (spamming even Bnet friends playing other games).
---
Here’s the [list of power-ups](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=18788).
---
I couldn't care less about getting "my name" on a server. I just want to play on a good server.
---
Does anyone really care that much to get a name?
---
Why can’t just norwegian and danish people move to Gehennas? It’s not overpopulated and you avoid the spanish and portugese speaking populations.
---
OP did say give them an hour to get it working.
---
This is great and you should feel great!
---
S to spit on retail.
---
I would say sorry that you are unable to grasp even the simlest concepts about how security works, but since you are likely past the age where school is mandatory, any ignorance is entirely your fault, so I wont.
---
Also, Enjoy the ignore.
---
It still auto-invite (matchmaking and auto-invite is not the same thing) and create a private grouping network within the game.
---
Omg there are two red shirt guys
---
Yeah, all this pearl-clutching nonsense over this one addon is just getting blown out of proportion. 
---
I'd like to argue that if you don't like the LFG addon then you are not allowed to use any addons because it's not playing the game as the devs designed and intended. 
---
Want to sort your bags? No bag addons to auto sort.
---
Want to know how much damage you did? Good luck parsing that shit by hand in your chat window.
---
Want to be an effective healer? Have fun with the default raid windows, because Healbot ain't an option.
---
Also get rid of that 200 button mouse because you only get four buttons max on a mouse.
---
And don't you fucking DARE even think about downloading Questhelper you weak-kneed casual. 
---
It's just a non-issue for the vast majority of the player base.
---
This is begging to be multiboxed.
---
Developer is removing auto-invite from dungeons. Private group networking no longer exists. It's public channels only (this was done 3 days ago). The streamer video is from retail wow. Feel free to join their discord.
---
To each their own.  I think gnomes look the best.  Win/Win for me haha (in a gnome laugh).
---
Shadowmeld is standing still.  But you get +1 stealth out of it as well.  I'm not sure how this applies to shadowmeld actually?  Would you know if your shadowmeld is considered a 61 stealth?
---
I guess my thing too, is that I was an gnome rogue in vanilla.  I didn't have to deal with perception on a day by day basis.  Sure, I'd hate dueling human warriors/rogues because they knew I was there and could pop perception.  But if you're a rogue/druid, you really should be getting the jump on people so stuff like hunters pre-trap or humans popping perception is only if they saw you first.
---
Still, human pops perception, you just wait it out and not open up on them.  You'd be silly to try to engage them while it's active.  It just delays the inevitable of you getting opened on.  If they get close to you, you can always throw a distract them facing the opposite direction and then walk away, they'll start flailing around trying to find you and you're long gone at that point.  Sure, as a warrior you could use that time to try and pop a demo shout or piercing howl to pop them out of stealth.  You still need to be in range of them and they only have limited ways to generate rage without being hit or hitting something.
---
But as the perspective of a rogue (and from my human buddies who fought rogues/druids) they said perception was good in theory, but in practice it wasn't 100% a button you press and all of a sudden all rogues are visible in front of you.
---
They get to go back, clean out their bags, stock back up on whatever, check their mailbox, and probably didn't lose much time at all.
---
Flight path back to EPL is 9 times out of 10 faster than trying to corpse run.
---
...what the fuck?
---
Inviting someone is not an icebreaker, you're diving in the deep end there buddy. You socialize after the group is made which counts for like 95% of the time spent in a group.
---
Missing out on the message someone sends you to get an invite is hardly even worth noticing as "non-authentic".
---
This kind of addon is inevitable, it's a short-cut that automates some minor tedium as well as grouping everyone who wants to do dungeons into a nice single spot so you can reach as many potential party members as possible. Without the add-on you'd just go stand on top of the bank and shout in lfg chat and do the same thing.
---
In reality this is no more classic-ruining than the modern macro scripting language.
---
&gt; Lol as if horde would ever try to kill me 1v1 when I don't have monsters attacking me.
---
What server you playing on?
---
The Gorilla Fangs in Feralas. I got like a level and a half grinding off them before I finally got the last fang. Fucking ludicrous.
---
You want it for quick threat gain more than DPS.  Feral DPS is still trash even with pummelers, unless you literally have enough to keep them up non-stop, which is impossible.
---
Yes! Giving her full blonde hair in the second panel would be perfect
---
You can just farm a bunch of them for like 30 minutes and bank them for raid nights.
---
Thanks, guess I just assumed reddit to be America-centric.
---
I have a night elf, human, and Tauren. I think I’ll make an undead once I can make more. I’m also new to WoW. I played the trial in 2007 but I never had a computer powerful enough to run it completely. Now my current machine can definitely handle classic so I’m excited to get into it.
---
I would pay to see that
---
The Piccolo from Forrest Hearthsinger, obviously.
---
&gt; Hunter got our guild's first Ashkandi drop, our MT and about 3 DPS warriors left
---
Why? Those people wanted that sword for their off spec, they had no use for in in raiding. The hunter needed that sword for raiding.
---
I have Sat and Sunday off, aside from spending time with my family before I abandon them for a few days I'm going to play through the WC3 and TFT campaign at night.
---
Sounds good, doesn't work.
---
Rofl I just love my facials man
---
I think folks are better off watching some fantasy movies that were popular when WoW launched.
---
I was never ashamed to be a WoW player until I went to Wal-Mart for the midnight release of TBC. There were about 300 people in line, and it was a very odd group of people.
---
I don't try to hide that I'm a gamer, but I don't advertise it.
---
Onyxia is in phase 1. Your set helm from her. She's not that hard even for a mostly dysfunctional raid. Many whelps!
---
Oke and why is that not possible with this addon? Because you want to whisper: "inv tank" so badly?
---
Have they been reported yet?
---
I live in CST and have found that while playing on east coast servers the raid times work MUCH better for me on average.
---
It'll also be nice to see night time in game.
---
Why is auto spam a bad thing? I mean you can literally make a macro that spams it or copy paste, is repeating that action really a necessary thing? Mind you this addon does not increase spam, it just makes it automatic instead of people spamming manually.
---
Why is chat parsing bad? LFG is full of junk is it really bad that the addon allows you to see the people you actually want to communicate with?
---
And what's wrong with selecting multiple dungeons lol? You do that in your head too.
---
What people don't seem to get is Blaumeaux won't be a low pop server and will be just as full as all the others.  The amount of people wanting to play Classic is WAY higher than the number of people who actually cared about reserving a name.  So all those people logging in on Monday for the first time will naturally attempt to join servers that aren't full.  Blaumeaux will have a high or full population within an hour of going live on Monday 3pm PST.
---
No Skull flame shied? That's basically the piece de resistance.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=1168
---
A troublesome grind is better than a mindless one
---
I'm excited babyyy
---
Tauren Druid tier 1!
---
No plans to play like most people seem to be claiming. I get in when I get in, I'm doing the quests even if it means waiting on spawns. It's too bad most of the video content around Classic is based on hardcore min-max and/or speed leveling.
---
Engineering is so expensive to level I am going to do that later on once I get my feet wet and make it to 60 then I can use my bank alt character to get to gathering professions to help level it
---
how hard is it to just say "Dps LF WC" in chat lmao.
---
I actually really like MR because it has good balance and the community so far seems to be really chill. The healer and myself have settled in nicely so we don't really want to move.
---
If you don't mind my asking, how come you're not interested playing on Mirage Raceway?
---
Everyday haha. Part of it is seeing what the realm pops are at.
---
or you just stay loyal to your faction you filthy traitor
---
Nah, thanks, mate.
---
If I want to watch Blizzard shit all over this franchise, I'll just log into BFA instead.
---
hmm....
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuced6/well_structured_video_on_why_classiclfg_addon_is/extijh0/
---
Ew
---
I'm still going to play both. I don't play retail often but I do play whenever new content drops. I'm a sucker for the lore! 🤓
---
By that same logic, many people wouldn't keep the addon open unless actively looking for a group either.
---
Eh, you're really stretching it at 2 weeks. FDs are supposed to end on the same week.
---
Still a beautiful play. Keep us up to date on how the market pretends to correct itself for like 3 days in a row next week and you panic sell for a 20% lose when you were up 120% today.
---
Auto-invite no longer exists for dungeons. Private groups don't exist it's public channels only. Feel free to join their discord.
---
That's why you join guilds and get to know people who wanna run dungeons
---
Level up alongside them. LFG is not desirable. There are better ways of doing it.
---
I too was embarrassed to tell my friends I played WoW. Now my only friends do play WoW (real friends) not my fake high school friends.
---
WoW was like a father to me  
---
I loved him like a son
---
It's not TERRIBLE. It's just not good.
---
It's much like Pacific Rim, it's a good 'bad' movie.
---
So another stupid question then. Since raids don't die out, is that a function of people only running for alts, or is it that the gear from later raids aren't better? 
---
I plan on playing warlock, and I've heard that aq20? gear is what has spell hit on it. Hence why they are better later in the game. 
---
Or is it that gear drops so little that you can be raiding aq20 and still need to replace one of your items with something from MC?
---
Thanks for the detailed response.
---
Engineering is *the* PvP profession. Maybe Alchemy too for those handy potions?
---
Lol. This one made me laugh.
---
Other posters have explained it well, but I'd keep your pet for PVP - the fel hunter and succubus just have too many useful abilities for PVP.
---
Remember enjoying doing the turn in quests for better forces or something in Vanilla AV so will check it out
---
Keys worked differently at the time, you *had to* pug back then, not so anymore, and even though you had to pug, pugging high keys was extremely rare.
---
My guild's main tank (warrior) through all of vanilla only had one hand, on a PvP server. Other than having to keyboard turn he was able to play just fine. He used like a one handed keyboard/mouse combination thing, but I have forgotten what the product name was.
---
maybe something happens this time, you never know.
---
Try a peanut-butter and banana sandwich with honey drizzled all over. Thank me later :) plus it’s filling and healthy.
---
The real trick is for your name to become such a huge meme that everyone feels as if you deserve to have it, so people even go out of their way to reserve it for you, just in case some unscrupulous bastard tries to extort you.
---
Thex is a genius.
---
Then why people said that nobody could know your spec if the addon that tells everyone what spec you have was in vanilla?
---
New York is on the east coast...........so yes.
---
With that attitude, perhaps we should make add-ons that automate the whole game for you.
---
Where do you draw the line?
---
Yeh engineering for sure, and if your not rich take mining with it
---
I haven't watched it again since it was in theaters but I've been meaning, maybe I should do that this weekend. It wasn't a masterpiece or anything but it was a lot better than people on Reddit give it credit for. That goes for a lot of things, actually.
---
Im more worried about the shadow priest mc xD
---
Engineering + Tailoring.
---
Since my original was removed for "low effort", here you go!
---
On Lightning's Blade, I recall a guy named Chains being obsessed with a warrior named Aedak. Aedak had made a [warrior vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPzEzkP1m5c) protesting that warriors didn't suck, and I guess this Chains guy saw it, and kind of became a fanboy, wanting to join the guild Aedak was in. Chains was thoroughly rejected by Aedak (who had a reputation of being an elitist ass). Then it got weird, as Chains kind of become obsessed with hating on Aedak as much as he could on the forums, where Aedak would usually just make fun of him. God that was some fun shit to read.
---
As i remember, most level cap lfg sentences will involve X/8 Tier 1 - showing how many pieces you have
---
I really hope the addon maker gets the clue here and doesn't put this out. It's antithetical to the game. So are addons like Weak Auras but it is what it is.
---
honestly sorry for being a dick but, I was kind of hoping to start a wave of "So we are probably No use to you." comments. I am bored.
---
Actually, I figured it out. Look in his post there is a raw data link.
---
They added four yesterday (Monday technically)... to each region. Have you seen this complaint today and if so where?
---
Without even asking I ended up getting Tuesday off.  Luck of the draw I guess, but I’m really looking forward to it!
---
This video gave so many Warriors false hope of being gods in BGs.
---
Some people never realized how much Pat was being healed in this video.
---
Thank you for the laugh
---
You just pick a new guild name. EZ fix
---
do you know when they are releasing the classic guide?
---
1/100th
---
Going ahead and reserving billdozer as my name...
---
As a rogue I will shower you with emotes of gratitude
---
I’d say frost would be better for a beginner, great survivability which will help when you’re getting to grips with the game.
---
:-(
---
it also makes it take ten times longer than necessary
---
Rip anyone who tries to do a quest with Murlocs.
---
&gt; I can't think of anything else other then flying mounts that would be less vanilla.
---
An actual LFG tool that teleported you to/from instances would be less vanilla.
---
Sharding would be less vanilla.
---
Cross-realm instances would be less vanilla.
---
There's a ton of stuff that would be less vanilla lol. This addon is just automating someone reading through a ridiculous stream of spam in a global LFG channel.
---

How to be one with no life
---
Step 1.) buy a mini fridge or two, one for freezing and the other for cooling. Alternatively, just get a freezer/cooler combo or an actual twin door fridge.
---
Step 2.) buy a toaster oven and/or microwave 
---
Step 3.) buy as many mountain dews, hot pockets, pizza rolls, and other various frozen meals to fit in your fridge.
---
Step 4.) buy a coffee machine, kurig or old school.
---
Step 5.) grab the darkest coffee you can find
---
Step 5.1.) you might want some creamer with that too.
---
Step 6.) install a catheter and colostomy bag because restrooms for noobs
---
Step 7.) ...
---
Step 8.) profit!
---
I’ll pay for undead priest. Both shadow and non shadow forms!
---
I did a couple laps round Org on my Teal Kodo yesterday. I didn't see anyone budge though, maybe they didn't realize what it was.
---
Call to arms was popular on our server as well as a few others. Matchmaking information is in the post above (bolded).
---
I have found in my days on vanilla wow and private servers that Arathi Basin is the pinnacle of endgame pvp for WoW even going in with permades the game is set up so that you are forced to split up and will many times get in to amazing 1v1’s or 2v2’s while you defend your flag. AV is basically who can raid faster with little to no pvp it’s all large premade PVE and in WSG some love the battle in the middle but I find it’s much too clustery and focuses more on capture the flag instead of 1v1 kills
---
That is fucking insane
---
You can copy the data to apply filters. If I allow anyone access to the sheet to apply filters it will get destroyed by anonymous users.
---
reminds me of oglaf a bit
---
no worries m8 :D
---
You make a baseless accusation like a scum liar. Get called out. Still cant supply evidence. Use a fat joke and try to change the subject. Again pathetic.
---
Hit me with those scurge areas fam
---
Depends on your time zone
---
Ngl i requested 27th &amp; 28th off so i could play.
---
Boss: why do you need off?
---
Me: look im not going to lie to you, i got 200hrs of pto and i want to sit on my ass and play video games.
---
Boss....well atleast youre honest.
---
Almost time for the queues lol
---
Yes i have the same problem, there is so much to do that i just burn out in almost no time.
---
it's just how the internet is now lol, I knew it would be like this, it won't emulate old wow other than in-game items, lore, etc
---
Not going to roll need on stuff cause that just ain't me, but I'm going to do my absolute best to play on people's prejudices and make them hate me.  Nonsensical and bumbling buffoonery that somehow inexplicably works.
---
I honestly can't wait to roleplay a huntard.
---
Might still need one on the account.
---
It might only be the realm restriction that was removed
---
Applying classic design philosophy to retail would be a nightmare. Classic has its charms but keep it quarantined to classic please.
---
It was fucking NORMAL mode LK that EVERYONE killed almost right away. Who cares.
---
There's a mage discord server for Classic that has a ton of guides, class quest guides, different specs based on how you want to play the class: [discord.gg/HVKcJx](https://discord.gg/HVKcJx)
---
My name "Retail", and I'm an undead rogue.
---
Angwe? /Dethecus
---
That would be an excuse to play actually.
---
I miss mana. Like in wow vanilla i felt like magic is a struggle and you need to learn to wild it, in retail i feel like im just another moron with a spellbook.
---
Depending on what class you play tbh.
---
True, you got me there. Loktar ogar mother fuckerssss
---
But the addon page says it won't even auto-invite either right? So it'll just spam a prewritten message into chat (like you'd already be doing by copy-pasting) and filter out chat by specific key words you've chosen?
---
We used to have someone with timers setup near their keyboard who would call out events during encounters.
---
Dude logging into just look at your level one character you haven’t even played yet has to be a sign of some sort of serious mental illness.
---
Good example of an “update” that obviously just made things worse. Too many “updates” and not enough cool shit.
---
Same with warriors.
---
I agree with all the points here.
---
If you had to put percentages on the effort of putting a group together (making sure everyone is decent, getting to the instance, making sure they have sane gear/specs, knowing people's reputations), how much of that effort is lost when your "LF1M DPS Scholo" macro is replaced by a UI that posts the same text in the same channel, and how much of that effort is lost when a DPS who used to be scanning /LFG is now scanning a UI that reads from /LFG?
---
I get that it makes it *easier*, but I just all seem so *insignificant* to me. You're still vetting players, you're still going to the instance, you're still having to make your way back. The UI automates the *least* human part of the process:
---
    LF1M scholo
---
    inv
---
That's what's going away. Should we miss it?
---
I think, broadly, it seems like a lot of what is happening is that people look at classic vs retail, and they know that classic has the secret sauce and retail doesn't. Then, they have to speculate about the secret sauce. Was the secret sauce that there were no flying mounts so that there's more tension in traveling the world? Was the secret sauce that you had server identity, a reputation, and would probably play with the same randos again in the future? Was the secret sauce that everyone had to travel to dungeons and that dungeons were difficult/long and required coop?
---
Was the secret sauce that when you had to form groups, it went like:
---
Lots of things make up the secret sauce in for classic, and no one really knows which ingredients you can change without hurting the flavor. Instead of reasoning about it, we just yell "DON'T TOUCH THE SAUCE RECIPE"
---
I'm loathe to admit it but same here. With regards to this the first is the best, though.
---
My goal is to use that soundboard to guide an Onyxia raid.
---
I play on Linux so routing one program's output audio to input is literally three button clicks, my raid will receive their commands 100% true to the original video. I will be a *god!*
---
Today is my last day at work till the 5th.
---
I have my sleep schedule and expected times per level on a spreadsheet.
---
My snacks, drinks and supplements are ready.
---
I have bough my GF $300 worth of fancy clothes fabric so she can sew herself new clothes while I game.
---
I have talked to my coffee pot, it says it is ready for a months worth of coffee made in a week.
---
Multiple practice runs to 15, quest guide ready, grind spots picked out for when I get sleepy/less effective.
---
I plan to get a personal best 1-60 time and get to 60 before I go back while still sleeping like a normal human.
---
No. That's what the party leader will do after you ask to join their group. This doesn't auto invite. You still have to whisper the party leader for a group invitation. They will probably ask you questions.
---
You are kidding yourself if you think that the author's backtracking on these features doesn't have to do with community uproar.
---
Not me. Im diving all in this Monday:)
---
For Classic? I think not. 
---
Though, I do think fondly of those old trailers. They don't make them like that anymore.
---
This is *truly* a masterclass in overreaction and doubling down. 
---
Bravo 👏🏽
---
Retail already exists bud, take your elitist trash with you when you go
---
You're the mad one. Can't accept the fact that Ion already stated those types of addons aren't authentic so you and your BFA friends are bombarding forums, twitter, and reddit to try and warrant it.
---
I see "blest" used to describe people pretty commonly. For example "I've been blessed with such great friends" or whatever.
---
Yeah it's not literally unwatchable
---
Herod
---
Cool me and my best friend can just circle jerk lol
---
It made the safety dance one of my favorite vanilla bosses.
---
Can't it be configured to pop up automatically when you take a flight path?
---
Orc hunter with boar pet. Give him starter gear with no shoulders or helm.
---
&gt; not my fake high school friends
---
Well, the thing is: People we meet in high school are forced on us. You were *friends* with Joe in high school because he happens to sit in the same classroom as you everyday for 4 years.
---
When the reason for meeting Joe is gone (high school ends), then ofc you won't be seeing Joe anymore.
---
But real friends are the ones you picked yourself and that's why they last.
---
yeah same.  Think I'll roll with whatever newest realm there is on Monday.  I think the worry over dead realms is less than the worry of shit getting toxic, personally.
---
... Are you serious?
---
True.  And that removes any oil you've put on the wand.  Also, switching weapons gives a GCD, which means when you need to start healing the tank, you either wait 1.5 sec longer or you start healing with your lesser wand.
---
I'm not saying you can't swap wands to maximize your mana.  I'm saying that at the high end, you aren't going to have time to manage which wand you have while continuing to contribute your maximum to a raid.
---
I too enjoy PCP on occasion.
---
Do you think Lenore will come home too?
---
Yes! Female orc shaman for the badass lady and human priest alt for the pretty lady.
---
I thought those where alpha icons cause i never played retail wow beyond wotlk. wtf those are so bad rofl what
---
You speak lies lol
---
Came here to say this exactly! That’s piccolo!
---
You can make it as competitive as you want. Get some buddies and start raiding enemy towns, you'll have a nice fight on your hands pretty quickly.
---
If you want some structure 1v1, you can duel outside Org/Ironforge all day, but that was never my jam.
---
Where are all the #nochanges advocates now? LFG as addon or even in built feature was available in and part of Vanilla.
---
Well for a simple example, I use an addon that highlights chat if certain keywords are written (such as my name)
---
There's a feature in weakauras where you can share weakauras by linking them in chat, that feature also relies on reading chat
---
Bossmods sometimes rely on reading chat as well
---
There's an addon that moves your whispers into a "instant messager" kind of window, that would also break.
---
That's juts off the top of my head.
---
Considering those are the primary complaints, what is this elusive mark? “Spirit of Vanilla”? LFG addons were in Vanilla, so that’s out the window.
---
Hahaha love that! I have no holidays left to take so a rookie mistake! Those other workers wouldn’t understand!
---
This is the info war!
---
Can you really not understand the difference between those two statements? I'm not asking that to be rhetorical, or semantic. They really mean two different things.
---
Results?
---
&gt; Also in fairly sure you could never trade loot in raids in vanilla, actually I'm certain as I was raidleader and master looter for all raids in MC in my guild.
---
You definitely couldn't, but they did add loot trading for classic.  So now when you raid, there will be a 2 hour window where the item can be traded to anyone else in the raid.
---
i did actually still a fun fact!
---
r/HailCorporate
---
What realm are you playing on? Want to avoid this kind of trash mentality
---
Im all set. Mage, then priest then rogue.
---
Aitt, thanks!
---
Yes from the discord Auto-Invite is no longer available for dungeons. It pretty much spams the LFG chat similar to a macro. Previously it spammed both public and private, but a lot of people complained about the private spam.
---
You want to sift through my profile again and see where I ever said that?
---
It's patch 1.7 content, so phase 4 is best guess.
---
No official confirmation, except it being a world event means it shouldn't be available in phase 1.
---
(just because they tested stuff like battle grounds (phase 3) and Honor (Phase 2) doesn't mean it's available phase 1)
---
The arms on the running Male Tauren makes them unplayable for me now, it’s like a toddler
---
Might give this one a go!
---
Macros are going to be doing the same thing. Blizzard is using the latest macro api in classic.
---
Train by day, AV by night, all day.
---
And how exactly are they different, do tell?
---
Agree with u 100% 
---
Hated this on pservers too to get a /w from some random dude just saying „inv“ or „u tank? u heal?“ and regretted almost every time cause this were the people who left after the first wipe or didnt say a word the whole dung and then ninjad some to them useless loot.
---
Communication is imo a big part of classic and am gonna be the guy whos blacklisting every dumbfuck whos not able to write atleast a greeting before his demand or question!
---
Cool try to change the subject again coward. I don't care if you are laughing, crying or angry. The result is still a pathetic man-child who can't own up to what they say.
---
Good idea, quick question when going blacksmithing how often do you find yourself crafting your own gear in your journey to level 60, and how often are you replacing your crafted gear with better crafted gear?
---
From playing vanilla and having LFG add-ons installed on my computer. Call to Arms wasn't that great until BC. oQueue was more barebones than what the new LFG is, but it's the same functionality.
---
As I've said before all the "new" Classic add-ons look better than what we had to use to Classic. Hell, most of classic's add-ons had you use text commands to see the menu and then change settings. There weren't that many that had fully functional graphic UI settings to play with.
---
The new LFG classic looks better than what was in Vanilla. But so do the other add-ons. Out of the box DeadlyBossMods is nearly 100% perfect. That didn't exist in Vanilla. All these quest helpers are way better than what existed in most of Vanilla.
---
I felt it was literally unwatchable. That khadgar tho...I only finished it as I watched it on a 13 hour flight home..
---
What happened to retail?
---
They started putting a timer on everything.
---
Set it on the banned addons list. That not breaks anything and it could just be renamed but it gets much user away with the question if they get banned also for using addons like this ;P
---
I have my work laptop with me too. I have a shoulder bag for my work laptop and backpack for personal.
---
I'm poor have some silver

Be warned, when I checked it it seemed littered with 15 year olds.
---
I had to disguise my laughing as a coughing fit at work. Well done sir
---
I want to go Alliance on a PvP Server, but the Faction inbalance for the Horde is a bit off-putting. Sure, i am interested in PvP, but don´t want to be "at a disadvantage" all the time. If I go to a PvE Server, what are the consequenses for battlegrounds ?
---
 I am ready to give up some Open-World-PvP experience for a bit more control in that regard, but what is the influence of server-population on battlegrounds and their "Quality" ?
---
Ahhh now we are backpedaling. Classic
---
I have to say you are a little judgemental eh? Oh wait you live on the subreddit /r/amiugly. It all makes sense. Gotta make yourself feel better somehow.
---
Not who you're responding to, but I've been indoor bouldering for years and can't consistently do v5's. I consider myself pretty good and fit as well... kinda convinced my gym just sets really tough! :P
---
Again, that's not how it works. Your LFM messages without the addon look the same as someone with the addon. People with the addon looking for a group will see your manually typed "LFM" chat message in the UI alongside every other group, addon or no, and whisper you "invite please" the same as they did in vanilla. 
---
No one looking to participate in a dungeon is going to go out of their way to figure out if you don't have the addon to snub you. That makes *their* experience worse for no reason. You're arguing that people with the addon will cut off their nose to spite their face.
---
Probably I’ll check with my doctor never
---
Taking the bridge? Thats a bold move cotton.
---
Damn they made everything look a little more human it seems. Pretty lame blizzard. 
---
Side note the classic human looks 100% more absurd than the new one... and 1000% more awesome. Where’d your sense of whimsy go, you wretched, crack dealing, dark overlords, you!?
---
WoW 2 was in our hearts all along
---
Blizzard should actually do this. I might legit cry if they did
---
When he got out of prison he lived in a van down by the river because he couldn't get a shitty job.
---
Yup. Have fun with dead servers OP
---
How do you stretch?
---
holy shit i love pixel art ! that is AWESOME , pls do more wow pixel stuff
---
Human hairstyles where the best in alpha, can't believe they don't even have it in retail instead of that anime hair
---
Bollocks, this is the 3rd time i've heard this sentiment. Sure the addon might have been downloaded a several dozen times back in 2005.
---
If you actually played WoW back then you'd know it was not a thing. Sure pretend it was if thats your way of justifying Addons such as these. 
---
Dont complain if something that clearly goes against the spirit of a game people have been waiting for for over a decade isnt welcomed.
---
I actually like this reply, because you’ve paid attention to your experience and have been able to express it well.
---
Pserver players don't care about item level because they know what's good. Retail babies want Ilvl and gearscore in so they can tell immediately if something is an upgrade rather than looking at the stats and thinking for a moment.
---
This is not true.. Feral has been shown to consistently be top 10, top 5 if you're highly skilled and dedicated, and top dps on certain fights.
---
It is more along the lines of being recognized out in the world and in cities instead of queued and then maybe recognized through a group finder addon. That recognition is less prevalent when you have an idle queue going for you instead of actively looking for people.
---
Even though Wrath was my favorite expansion and when I played most, dungeon finder ruined the sense of community and the need to stay together. The addons some will use will be more primitive in that they won't teleport them to the instance or whatever, it does the hard work for the party, actually finding a new member.
---
So, I want my reputation on my server to cause me to be recognized in as many places as possible, and this addon is a detriment to that by doing the work needed for group formation automatically, without /who, adding people during or after runs, or maybe, potentially, even joining guilds if people are that socially averse. The last example might be a bit far-fetched, but all scenarios get your name out and around the world, and this addon cheapens me into a role, just like dungeon finder did.
---
This is textbook slippery slope. "Taking a bit away" doesn't allow any other bits to be taken away, or imply that they will be taken away. Each bit you decide to take away is a separate consideration that either happens or doesn't.
---
Adding a chat parser / periodic chat poster that puts a UI on the LFG spam takes a bit away, but doesn't "open the gates" to a change that teleports us to instances and back or adds flying mounts.
---
Also, this addon will not force everyone into using it. It literally posts in /LFG where anyone can read, and any addon can write.
---
Can you guys stop arguing and just tell us what ctrl+click does?
---
[LFG addons existed.](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/CallToArms/)

You want to start with Mining and Blacksmithing until you get the BS quest for the Glimmering Mithril Insignia, then you can drop BS for Engineering, the only profession you really need, but you might as well stick with Mining to farm your own Engineering mats. 
---
Personally, as Holy Priest, I'll start with Mining and Tailoring, since I'll want to craft myself the Truefaith Vestments, then drop tailoring for BS, etc..., so if you ever intend to heal and/or simply want one of the best cloth Chest pieces a healer can get, you might also want to do that.

theres also a building name and road sign in the image..

Change this to

Or

2:play world of wacraft by yourself
---
Vanilla 13/14 - Classic 25
---
It uses default LFG public channels. It's inclusive, as stated, if you are not using it, you can join groups created by it.
---
&gt;&gt; "LF 1 ot prot pally/war. Know Fights + must have DBM!"
---
Nobody says this. That's just not how people spoke in vanilla or even on Nostalrius. You might just not understand, and I hope enough OGs are playing that you can learn how it's done.
---
I really don't understand the problem.  A LFG addon will never be able to instantly transport you to a dungeon.  Won't this eventual addon only show you a list of people that are looking for the same dungeon?  Wouldn't it be similar to a /who request with the 50 past messages of those asking in chat to join a group for a dungeon?  Wouldn't this just make it better than spamming in /trade of /lookingforgroup?
---
10/10 best meme iv seen on this sub

Yeah.

Hope not for this exact reason.

It's all good, buddy! Take your time, join a newbie-friendly guild, learn from the pros, and interact socially with people who have similar goals. Enjoy the ride imo.

---
Imo, classic isn't about that small scale competition you are into. It is more rpg than any iteration of wow. It is about the world and the organic events that crop up. Bgs are the only real stray from that pvp wise. I've always liked arenas myself, but classic wow pvp isn't so much about that as it is the actual faction war out in the world. There isn't much in the way of what you are looking for in it, unfortunately. I feel like if you could change up your mindset a bit though, you would have a blast, just in a different way.
---
you can shoot me an email from my website mortmort dot net Im a little booked on Commissions at the moment but I'd love to help
---
Ha! Don't worry, OP made sure to get [his picture](https://imgur.com/JPwEEef) as well :)
---
It's 2019 man, you go get or you get got. It's a much more overall cultural shift since 2004 rather than just a wow culture shift.
---
It'll be cross faction, but any and all communication will be through Discord.
---
They will just coincidentally have the other-faction gank squads camp people who don't  pay up
---
Whatever she prefers.
---
Literally anything levels great with a warrior because you can nullify their downtime, but especially healers.  That said, any 2's goes great in vanilla.
---
1-40 priest leveling spec is 5/5 improved wands, and 5/5 spirit tap,
---
After that the rest of the points don't matter much, all that really changes if your opening hard casted opener.
---
40-60+ is where you can actually see a difference between a shadow priest and holy priest solo leveling, and group healing.
---
That being said, shadow spec can heal any 5 man content,  just holy or disc could do it a bit better. And Holy solo's fine it's just very boring, but zero downtime.
---
Combat
---
You know what I'll bring it, eff it, whats the worst that can happen? Might not have toooo much time to actually play, but I reckon I can come back and try to play for an hour or two before bed each night (if we don't get into a habit of grabbing drinks, that could be an issue). Insanely early mornings though, but worth it I think haha.

I'm still gonna use it.

There you go. I’m actually annoyed I had to search server discords in the search bar because your sorry ass couldn’t be bothered to
---
&gt;Most tanks outside raids are not going to have that
---
The post specifically mentioned wiping the raid.
---
&gt;And revenge is only available after a dodge/parry, isn't it
---
And blocks. One of which is essentially guaranteed to happen from the initial hit due to shield block. 100% guaranteed with decent avoidance gear.
---
&gt; It's like CallToArms Vanilla addon
---
Users could create their own global channels in vanilla.
---
You could also just have a friend spam "LFM ..." in trade chat, and when they got a response, they'll tell you who.
---
&gt; It will be easy enough to find a replacement.
---
And then you'll wait for them to get to the dungeon, plus get through any trash that respawns.

This is such a small deal it's surprising people are so frantically upset about it.

i don't see the issue.

EVEN if it worked like you think it does. You didnt ask for invites with your life story, you just said "invite please"...maybe include your class and level
---
It's not the names, but people seem to have an emotional attachment to a server they haven't even played on yet.
---
People say they don't want to reroll when they haven't even rolled yet.
---
Are implying that people are so good at the game now that they simply don't take damage anymore?
---
Then complain there's no pvp because everyone has supers from risk free rorq mining.
---
Your post is equivalent to saying nothing. If the equivalency is false, then show it.

What's wrong with it?

Or be in the military where do kinda follow those rules, for instance 27th of August is 27AUG19.

---
If you are on a PvP server, you can easily make something like it somewhere else.  Just pick a zone that is fairly easy to get to and open enough for PvP without too many mobs, old Dalaran might work, and post about it on your realm's forums/reddit.  With word of mouth, you can make a fairly large fight club pretty quickly when there isn't much other structured PvP.  Just realize that you are herding cats and not going to be able to do much aside from gathering people and throwing waves of players at each other without a ton of work.
---
If players are chatting outside of the game, it'd be fairly easy to get a bunch of high level players to be enforcers and let lower levels duke it out while the high levels attempt to enforce any rules you want, whether that is no healing/no potions/etc.  Lots of room to create pvp arenas, just need to put in a little legwork.
---
That’s the plan! I’ve got a friend who played WoW for years and is beyond hyped for classic, so he’ll be my guide for the most part, so I’ll have plenty of opportunity to learn!
---
Thanks!!
---
I'm going to try to get this word in the English lexicon please help me.
---
Good to hear. I really want to make a berserker , I used to play eqoa and one of the master classes for a barbarian was a berserker so I would make a rogue or warrior and go berserker, ultimately lowering my defense and boosting damage dealt, only in wow I’m trying to replicate that. So my vision is to have a troll dual wielding some bad ass one handers and getting some crazy damage enchants and then when running low on hp pop my berserker troll racial and just go ham +attack speed etc and hopefully down my targets with ease. Maybe not competitive as a min max orc but I would like to be the best troll fury warrior on my server :)
---
Where is the cd drive though. He almost had us fooled

Surfing in counter strike is going to be my flight path game

&gt;Grobuluss seems to be filled with cool people
---
Hell how does he know this?? Nobody's even gotten into the game yet.
---
are people really bothering GMs about an addon for retail, showed by a streamer on the retail servers, and how it will affect classic?
---
the addon creator has already stated that there will be no auto invite function in the classic version and yet everyone is up in arms about how he/she is lying through their teeth because they somehow know the addon better than the creator does.
---
there were LFG addons in Vanilla itself, and vanilla also had the meeting stones directly in game as a LFG function (does not matter if they were not used, they were added to the game by blizzard themselves).
---
if a simple addon that shows people who are interested in grouping up for an activity breaks the immersion of the game because they don't have to sit in ORG/IF spamming trade/world chat all day, then streamers break the game even moreso
---
I think that you are underestimating the capabilities of addons.  It would not be that hard to give each BIS for every class an individualized gearscore and then on top of that give a combination gearscore based off of set bonuses.
---
Not actually sure. I think maybe realm-wide
---
&gt;to me
---
Yeah, exactly. I just personally have more fun with a more open ended natured approach as opposed to min/maxing as hard as humanly possible. Even something like 10-manning dungeons severely underleveled sounds fun to me.
---
They should have remove talent trees and ask self proclaimed top original high level raiders exactly what elitest build would be required to play for every particular class. This was suppose to be an njoyable semi nostalgic replay of the original. The fact it's been 15yrs later and these people at 15yrs older, it's sad they act like the children they were. Probably whiney babies crying about der loooot stowlen by the meanieeee huntarrr
---
They said they might but the chances are honestly slim. It was a bug.
---
Because there are two +click functions in the game like that, and he was unaware of at least one of them. It's weird that you can't see the connection
---
How's trying to get some sort of collab going with someone you don't know and that's been away from the game for years, being "nice"?
---
RIP Retail/Live forever and LONG LIVE CLASSIC.

Ignore everyone telling you you cant tank as 2h. You do you man. Just get a good healer
---
It advertises as being able to press through all layers of general chat. I have no clue how/if that would actually work.
---
So, assuming Id missed something I looked into it.
---
Mind saying how this isnt what I assumed it was?
---
Wave or dont, you die nonetheless.
---
&gt; the addon creator has already stated that there will be no auto invite function in the classic version 
---
The addon creator stated there is not, yet there was. People want him gone, because they do not trust him.
---
Pretty sure female orcs were the statistically rarest combo in the game, even accounting for class.
---
Couple weeks ago it was about streamer servers, before that it was layering, now its about this add-on and private server Mafia's. It's the 24 hour news cycle that gaming sub reddits devolve into.
---
Its a mace though :/
---
I played with DR on Scatter/Freeze for the better part of a year. This is the patch we are on. I survived, so shall you.
---
I agree
---
Because they think it's the new gearscore/roi which they believe is the reason they can't get into groups on retail.
---
Thanks mate 👍🏻
---
Well the way I see it is that if you get stuck on a quest and have no idea what to do you aren't going to ask chat like you'd probably do 15 years ago, you're probably just popping open Google. Questie or not you're still not interacting with the community. 
---
ClassicLFG on the other hand is taking away that community interaction, the bot chats for you, invites for you and forms your group for you. You're not incentivized to find a guild to ask, you're not incentivized to ask in general or trade chat, that dialogue isn't going to open up. People with the addon are going to expect a Retail dungeon experience "Everyone is here for the loot and not to interact with each other"
---
That's why I believe that while Questie isn't good ClassicLFG is worse
---
Shut up with your negativity, you're what's wrong with the internet!
---
Yes, that is exactly what I want as well lol.
---
Probably try to pick a server and hype it as much for alliance as possible so people don’t migrate off. A 55/45 split isn’t bad but a 60/40 might cause a runaway
---
Say I am starting a group, I tell it I am running RFC. Every 30 seconds it will post in public chat "LF4M for RFC"
---
Someone else has the add on, it parses chat and sees I am looking for more for RFC. My name appears on a list with what I am looking for. If I want to join I have to whisper the leader.
---
It's basically just a nice UI so you dont have to manually spam chat, or stare at spam hoping you catch the people looking for a group.
---
No worries my friend, entitled gamers will be the first to quit even before tourists.
---
No you won't.
---
Chances are we won't even play on the same server, so you'll never find me.
---
this is great kek
---
"Could you not use it and not care? Yeah sure, but now you're not getting invited to groups." 
---
Isn't that the price you pay for not wanting to do something a portion (small or large) of the community wants? 
---
The difference is that not banning/disabling these Add-ons doesn't take any options away from you. I agree it will change the landscape - I'm also saying that players are going to want that change. 
---
Again, I really don't remember an uproar when we finally got LFG in game.
---
I was honestly thinking of making an female rogue and naming her rouge just for this. So when people ask for a rouge I can reply.
---
When do we get to the real meat and ban "My girlfriend made this cake/needlepoint/shitty watercolor"?

You will get goosebumps. I promise &lt;3

So you think you are idle in the city waiting? You expecting this addon to teleport you to the dungeon?
---
Even the 10 commandments don't say people can't Photoshop workers onto fictional character artwork. If you're ever being a bigger asshole than God, you fucked up

Use it, get bored of Classic, and leave for BfA, please.

On behalf of this community, I beg you.

big if true
---
I thought female dwarves were, and still are
---
*aggressively clicks Enter World button*
---
If there's a place where this kind of thing wouldn't work it would be Grob. A large portion of that server is very interested in wpvp, multiple raids would form to wipe out any "mafia" just for the action.
---
No need. Blizzard will shut this addon down, and potentially ban people it detects using it. Blizzard have been very clear that they won't allow addons and operations that hurt Classic WoW, which this does.
---
This is a stigma I find untrue in the later levels.  There are ways to conserve mana if you use down ranked frost bolts for quick freezes, wand to finish off mobs, and use mage armor.  Use evocation whenever the cooldown is up.
---
This addon makes it easier for groups to not get lost in the cracks, increasing the number of groups made overall. It makes players with or without it harder to lose track of after they've advertised they're looking. 
---
This is not a zero sum game. 
---
There are plenty of people that never made it into a group because they were missed, or put out their message at just the wrong time. There were plenty of groups that fell apart because they didn't find a last member.
---
This addon makes those people less likely to be lost, and increases the pool of dungeon runners by increasing awareness of people looking to run dungeons. It also reduces attrition from excessive time taken to form a dungeon group.
---
An addon can be an improvement without costing people without it anything.
---

I really want an image of an orc sitting on a gory throne of quillboar bones and meat, looking mad as hell with a single tear rolling down his cheek.  Memery aside, Mankrik is kinda awesome.

Unless you actually know how tsm sniping works...mwahaha
---
These posts keep selling me on this Addon . Continued thanks.
---
It's not like this addon creates spam, it just takes the macro spam and turns it into addon spam.
---
To my knowledge, no other purchase is necessary, just the sub. So they should be able to do the above
---
Your just playing. It’s cool and all. But there isn’t anything boss like about it.
---
That's spot on, it perfectly reflects their personality.
---
I think hes making fun of classic players. 
---
Let's get him boys. 
---
But seriously after classic is burning crusade time. Retail is a thing of the past. 
---
We shant speak of it again.
---
What are you going to play?
---
What if an addon is created which gives each BIS for each class a new gearscore entirely seperate to ilvl?  It wouldn't be that difficult either.  Their are already websites out there which score each and every piece of gear.
---
Wash those dirty ass babies.
---
Yes. No purchase necessary other than the sub.
---
thanks man, i think ultimately I'll be pretty casual and won't care about being perfectly optimized, I'll just have fun with my friends, if that means that I'm doing a "sub-optimal" build for sake of fun, so be it
---
In dungeons it's better for tanks to use sunder. Better rage to threat ratio. In raids where rage for the tank isn't a problem, yes, spam HS or Cleave.
---
believing in god to own the athiests
---
Yes, the only thing you need to play classic for the 800th time is a sub.

If you're ever fighting a warlock / priest / warrior and they pop a shadow reflector - reflect a CoR on yourself, now they can't fear you :)
---
Her cat butt, I'm a terrible tank.

If u weren't joking around, atheism is just a lack in belief.. You don't need to proclaim that God doesn't exist to be an atheist

I would love to blame my current health status (I am a little bit ill, better now than on release) and the meds I am taking. But all that is to blame is me.

That's why we have double active readers with a fifth of the subscriptions.

&gt;There are only two differences between retails LFG tool and this addons, and that’s teleportation and xrealm players.
---
I was discussing thinking you knew what it's about. You are wrong. It's chat parser that better displays messages from chat, it make people that aren't using the addon being able to interact with people that are using it. It doesn't fetch people by level/gear/class, you will still need to interact with the people interested and ask questions to make your group fit the task. It doesn't present you the perfect people from a poll of players queueing, people need to select your specific advertise message (as you do in default chat usage).
---
You can heal dungeons fine as any hybrid spec. Shadow Priest, Enhancement Shaman, Feral Druid, etc, etc. All can heal dungeons perfectly fine. You have access to virtually the entire healing kit.

I'm more of a poop bucket guy!

Yeah, the subscription gives you the base game all the way up to legion for free.
---
People are actually using their own money to advertise for Blizzard now? What the actual fuck
---
I can attest to that add-on was popular on Stormeeaver as well. If I recall correctly it was more used on full server as it was way harder to keep up with trade spam there
---
&gt;I don’t think they’re ready.. :)
---
15 years of running a wow but they aren't ready?
---
They'll be fine and servers will be fine :)
---
Wow... Any macro, dps/hps meter, DBM, and a multitude of others are more involved and automated. I'm assuming you aren't using any addons by your statement. But I'm sure your an advocate of DiscordLFG right? Lol fool.
---
Those are the only two ways I personally can think that blizzard can disable the functionality of the addon, if they wish to.
---
I think that removing the ability for an addon to auto invite players (who are not on your friend/ guild list) goes someway to fixing it, as then you will be more likely to inspect the player who is joining your group. And stops the ability for you to make a group, go AFK for a minute and the group to be full.
---
I just don't see how else blizzard can disable this addon, if they wish to.
---
Yep. I also downloaded hmm a less official classic wow to play around while I eagerly wait for Monday night :(

An official government announcement that they will pay some actors to play zombies. Please act panicked and scared and pretend that you're trying to survive and it will all be over within 3 days.
---
It won't be the same. It won't be remotely close to the real thing. And probably won't even be fun.
---
If you can get warden staff to drop, and even then it'll be pricey off AH. Even on a fresh server, I'd expect at least 50g+. Unyielding maul is equally as good but doesn't come out until DM with phase 2.
---
Also bear tanking is simpler in you literally spam maul but you have less "oh shit buttons" and also can't block or parry. I found when I was healing bear druids, it took a lot of getting used to because of huge damage spikes and a lot of people aren't used to that, granted this was on pservers and their numbers may have been fudged a bit.
---
I agree Mythic+ is harder, but it's also a completely different experience and hard for different reasons.
---
M+ is difficult because of the affixes, the infinite scaling based on what level key you do, and most importantly the timer. It's essentially a speed run with various gimmicks to slow you down. A lot of the challenge comes in trying to do risky pulls to make the timer.
---
Older content dungeons (nilla/BC) were a different thing altogether. I wouldn't necessarily call them difficult, but limited resources (mana, CDs on long timers), limited AoE stuns/CCs (superfluous in retail), managing aggro, etc. are all things that slowed the dungeon down and added some of that challenge that people remember (and getting 2-shot if not DEF capped in a Heroic BC dungeon).
---
Both have some appeal, they are just very different. I personally get really tired of M+, and the reward structure that accompanies it makes it even worse.
---
Retail isn’t fine, that is pure denial.
---
Rarest combo recorded I believe was Female Dwarf something, can't remember what. In retail it was Female Dwarf Mage last check, but I can't remember the Vanilla stats.
---
Firemaw is looking good for me as an alliance player, at least for now
---
And also the most toxic and immature and highly populated. Just my opinion anyway based on discord and their subreddit
---
I am personally avoiding that like the forsaken blight
---
There is no base game to buy, all you need is a sub to play classic. Your friends should be fine just upgrading a trial account.
---
That's your opinion, there are plenty of other people who are like me who haven't played retail in 10 or more years and have been waiting for legacy and for retail to die...have no interest in that childish game imo it's a completely different game from Classic that we want no part of the day it dies would be amazing.
---
Care to explain why "auto-invite" is a bad thing?
---
Is that right click -&gt; invite really a meaningful interaction for you?
---
&gt; When I was in high school that was quite impossible unless you were deathly sick or something.
---
Depends on your parents really. For me personally my mom wouldnt let me stay home if I was on my death bed, luckily I'm an adult now so I've got the week off to play
---
No reason you can't. Some of the "wasted" time running will be made up for by the fact that you can get several good flight paths along the way. Hit Undercity, Orgrimmar, xroads, and Thunder Bluff all in one trip.
---
I think you get logged out after being on the character select screen for 30 minutes, regardless of you moving the mouse/spinning the character/switching characters.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuhzxf/most_popular_pvp_eu_server/).
---
You are a true savior of Azeroth
---
Currently you get logged out after 30 minutes, no exceptions.
---
Maybe they'll change this close to launch so that nobody gets screwed if they logged in 33 minutes early.
---
But when do they change it? It's a risky gambit.
---
You'll be fine. I played vanilla months after it was released and still had a blast even though people were already level 60. There's always people joining or making new characters to play with.
---
*High Elves. Blood Elves only became a thing after Arthas used the Sunwell to resurrect Kel'Thuzad and they were forced to seek new sources of power, which led them to Outland and fel magic.
---
No - reroll to a fresh server or sit in queue like the rest of us
---
Yes, they were. First notable kill was Lady Vashj world 2nd and ever since then they were always in the top 5 of guilds, even more often in the top 3 until starting their world firsts with MoP proper. Ever since then they've had world firsts for 13/17 raids.
---
So, looking at the overall timeline of the game in total, Nihilum were definitely the best from late Vanilla until mid-late wrath, starting with C'thun and ending with Algalon in Ulduar under the name of Ensidia, where they started getting overtaken by other guilds, one being Paragon. 
---
They essentially reigned supreme for a total of 2 expansions.
---
Cata was Paragon's game, while for Tier 13 basically any noteworthy guild except for Blood Legion got their main chars banned for exploiting. Yes, Method, Ensidia and Paragon as well.
---
But ever since then Method has been at the top. Add to that the ever increasing difficulty and resources that have to be invested in order to maintain that level, which one can see nowadays due to progress and often even preparation being streamed.
---
Taco taco taco night!
---
Well you can still dps in groups but you'll usually be passed up for classes with higher dps. End game at least
---
Ahh, so no addons at all. You realize macros, and most of the other addons are more automated than ClassLFG correct. I'm going to assume you're that smart so I guess I can assume you are not going to install any addons at all. Not even raid required ones or that just makes your comment laughable.
---
I'm installing the add-on just for you.

---
Took a quick look at the source, nothing in it jumps out at me as being unavailable in classic.  It should work just fine, just be sure to "Load out of date AddOns"
---
You should consider using the Argent Defender—the shield with a +50% block chance proc—instead of drillborer. Despite the low proc Chance, you should have great uptime due to the number of mobs on you. And the block boost should make your boSanc and shield spikes wayyyyyy more potent
---
How do I get some Dwarf sounds for some Hemit RP?
---
You would think so, yes
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but this wont work at launch, for launch there will be layering and then that will be removed after X amount of time correct?
---
It's more about time. If you have the time to get through raids then you'll probably be fine.
---
Late vanilla, early/mid raids were being pugged. Once all the hardcore progression players get worn out and leave things will be more relaxed.
---
I HAVE A MIGHTY NEEEEEEED!
---
&gt; It’s essentially necessary to do competitive DPS as Feral.
---
Yea that's part of the reason no one raided as that. I think out of the 3 raid teams my classic guild organized, there was literally 1 feral druid.
---
Depends how early you show up and on luck. You might need to spam relogging to the game just to get in the queue and because people won't leave early it could be anything between 1-10 hours.
---
You can always just switch to a not full realm if it's too much but I'd imagine those will get full when people start relocating.
---
What's a connemt?
---
By the light those retail icons are ugly AF. They are literally a downgrade of the original ones. The original ones look cool. I demand to know who is responsible for this minor but significant change. Who had the last word on this.

There was a post at the AMA that mentioned a couple explicitly tethered and not, though I forget which.

Cross realm isn't a thing in Classic so you don't have to worry about any add-ons grouping you cross realm. It'll always be your own realm because it has to be.

It's interesting that some groups are taking an EVE heavy approach to the game, when the very same approach contributed to the stagnation of EVE (and the death of the Chinese Serenity Server)
---
Affectionally known as "The Blue Dougnut" in EVE, it's been a fantastic killer of content, and combined with open API from CCP it's led to the death of natural content and small-gang/solo PVP.
---
Fortunately the main killboard operator decided to run a blackout recently in the theme of CCP's local chat blackout, and the result has led CCP to consider what restrictions they can make on the API to prevent oppressive levels of intel dictating gameplay.
---
I'd hope Blizzard do the same and come down hard on this sort of activity, because it truly kills the open world game - including for those involved in the coalition.
---
Checkmate, atheists!

They aren't "recreating the original feeling of vanilla".  They are recreating 1.12 with staggered dungeon/pvp phases.

Ive been playing wow for years. I enjoy BFA. I also kinda just have a positive outlook on life AND really am looking forward to classic as well. Who wants to log into a game, try and find the negative stuff about it and then complain?
---
Classic is going to be hard as hell, if i get killed by a rogue, oh well, its part of the game. Just enjoy the hell out of the atmosphere, the players, and the game itself.
---
I don't get how people can be so negative about games.
---
The current WoW players that complain all the time about BFA probably would say Pong is a terrible game because its "BORING". It's all perspective.
---
Gamers are generally seen as different, its not a bad thing. Some are toxic, some are chill as hell, and some are just plain annoying. Find a good group of friends in BFA or classic and you'll have a blast.

Just use them as they are. They adjust to race and gender automatically, as they just call emotes.

Please answer this question or just shut up the BS meters are reaching absurdly stupid levels here.

I believe each phase will last at least 2 months, there are 6 phases and they pretty much all relate to endgame content that is relatively easy to catch up on. And that only applies if you plan on raiding. So you've got plenty of time

You're delusional.

The addon they speak of itself sounds way too powerful for Blizzard to let it slide. As for precedence you could look into the relatively recent drama regarding model editing, they slapped a banwave on that despite the fact that it's benign in 99.9% cases of use. They suddenly decided they don't like it and banned thousands.

The totem gives your character a buff, which grants the WF enchant to your weapon.  The buff lingers for a few seconds if the WF totem vanishes, like other totems.  The question is whether the enchant lingers if you swap MH and OH weapons, or if it is only constantly applied to your MH and never your OH.

It's a bit of a nuanced question.

So we're going to be getting these for every quest available in vanilla now?
---
This has probably been said already but I didn’t read through every comment.
---
You don’t want to tank with a 2H only because the time between attacks. If you get one, or even worse, two miss/parry/dodge in a row, you’re absolutely destroying your TPS and will lose threat. The time between attacks is that much more time for you to start building threat on the target. Even Fury/Prot builds (don’t consider this until you’re BWL geared) use 2 1H weapons.
---
True that, but not so much the processed, high fructose variety. It is good to keep aware of that though
---
Logic checks out.
---
There's some amount of barrier being lowered, which causes some amount of less group cohesion which is some amount of bad - and all that together is the cost.
---
On the other hand, the benefit is you have a less spammy LFG tool, and are able to do the content you think that you want to do do slightly easier.
---
So, there's benefit. We weigh the cost against the benefit, and do whichever side we think wins. Cost exceeds benefit? Don't do it. Benefit exceeds cost? Do it.
---
In the case of retail group-finder that puts you in dungeons cross-realm with players you'll never see again? Insanely high costs, small benefits. Classic wow parser addon that reads/writes to LFG chat? How is that cost/benefit looking? I know for me, they're both small, but I think it's on the side of worth it.

So a 38 year old kid, doesn't change anything. Take a look at your own comments buddy. Or any of the comments in this thread from purists like you. If you think I'm bugged, you people are cracked. It's genuinely embarrassing, and there's no doubt that Blizzard employees are cringing whenever they see these posts. Have some damn perspective.
---
"The people that actually care about the game" implying that anyone who doesn't want to deal with spending an hour spamming nonsense in chat doesn't care.
---
Spoiler alert, Vanilla (while having very strong points) was a horribly flawed game, and the people who simply want to make it a bit less frustrating to deal with care the exact same as you. Grow up.

Is this real? If so, you’re a legend

It never was?  PvP was PvP.  It was only cross faction collusion that would get you in trouble.

Imagine thinking that a class could tank a dungeon at 40, but can't at 60, as if there is some huge insane power spike. You can heal all dungeons as a non heal spec with int gear on. Just like you can tank all dungeons as a DPS spec with a shield on. There's no difficulty in those dungeons lol, the only "hard" thing would be aoe tanking but even a Warrior can't guarantee threat on every mob in AoE situations.
---
Bears have zero issue with aggro, it's honestly the thing they do best. Their issue is large scale AoE tanking and lack of EXTRA taunts (not needed in dungeons).
---
Step 1: don't
---
Step 2: use the multiple layers to get as much leather as you can
---
Step 3: wait until there are 1 to 2 layers left
---
Step 4: start controlling the spawns, simultaneously seeking off the leather you collected.

Step 5: gains

No, I said this.
---
&gt;The addons some will use will be more primitive in that they won't teleport them to the instance or whatever, it does the hard work for the party, actually finding a new member.
---
It still does the work for you. That work is integral to sticking together in an instance.
---
You should do it yourself, and that's my stance on it.
---
Undead rogue.
---
Mmm I smell jealousy here
---
So does classicCodex just kinda show quests and their objs on the map without having an arrow telling you where to go constantly?
---
And my AXE!!
---
Most of these will be implemented into the game at some point, at the start? No  
---
But soon
---
human t3 with TF
---
I was talking about the reaction. You are on classic forum for people who are hardcore about classic. What the hell do you expect when someone says “I want something similar to what I have on retail”
---
First time priest here, I was once a druid and now I have seen the Light! I can't wait :).
---
There is! Go to the battle.net client, where is says world of Warcraft on the left click it. Right above where it says “Play” or “install” there will be a little drop down. Hit that select “world of Warcraft:classic” hit install.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
Instructions uncl-
---
Absolutely. A lot of the sounds went from a satisfying 'ka-chunk' sound to some kind of weird 'whiff' sound that kinda makes it feel like the attack missed. Warriors have a LOT of sounds that ended up like this.
---
have you guys considered that spending time with your wife is more important than playing wow?
---
go tailoring and enchanting. Talioring will get you your first epic piece. 
---
Grind 60 cloth in the starting zone, create the greens, DE  them for the mats for a wand, have a wand by level 7/8 ish... there are guides on this.
---
God help the blizzard employees tasked with shifting through all of the bullshit
---
The gathering professions would depend a lot on how the whole layering thing works out, and how populated the server is. Prices are usually very low early on, but it should help out with gold for lvl 40 mount etc.
---
Well then ur a dumbass and should never be on a lc. Hunters want crit, they already have tons of ap due to their agi 2 ap per. Ashkandi is a pvp item for hunters full stop, dalrends is straight up better and it's not even close. Zg hakkar weapons are better and it's not close.
---
You got some learning to do god damn.
---
You're adorable. Literally everything about a bear tank in vanilla assumes that the people CARRYING you are fine with a sub-optimal tank. If you've got a min/max crew lined up and ready to destroy all content (who isn't already thinking of using superior Fury warriors anyways), then more power to you. You must be a pretty kewl guy to have healers that want to work extra hard healing your ass. The general masses though? 
---
Like I said, I'll be back.
---
hahahaha
---
pow
---
Are there going to be OG gms?
---
Yes, but still not sure which one to main.
---
Making friends as you play is how most of us did it back in the day. A shared quest, a dungeon run with someone you worked well together with, a save in PvP. Can happen so many ways.
---
Or the bridge from Wetlands to Arathi Highlands (Thandol Span?)
---
This is a market and market philosophies apply. 
---
Collective farming is just collective farming. Non-competitive price fixing due to fiat monopoly is still problematic but less actionable. 
---
Entities which abuse functional rules to protect or gather resources without following the behavioral terms of the system can and should be punished. 
---
Whether entities conspiring without abusing functional rules should be punished or if consumers must accept the inflated prices is a separate, but still actionable, matter, if deemed by a regulating entity (Blizzard) to be disruptive.
---
There isn't much of that in /r/wow, they are genuinely excited for classic. Then people will say something along the lines of "Classic will overtake/kill retail", and the response usually is along the lines of "No, it'll have a huge surge of initial interest, a lot of players will give up on the grind quickly, but it should have a healthy and stable player base, just smaller than retail."
---
2 is for casuals, I've traveled with 3 laptops. Personal, locked-down corporate machine, and unrestricted dev machine.
---
You're an idiot. LFG tools existed in Vanilla. I doubt you ever played this much vaunted Vanilla whose soul you claim will be tainted by this.
---
LFG tools existed in Vanilla and did not destroy anything, hell you probably never noticed because you didn't even realize they existed!  Look up CallToArms friend. Look up how Meeting Stones worked in Vanilla. LFG is an intended function that Blizzard attempted to poorly implement with meeting stones, and players, being super impatient, decided to not journey to a meeting stone to tag into a queue for the dungeon (that's right, meeting stones auto-queued you for a dungeon group, but they didn't work because no-one knew about it or used them!) and would rather sit in IF spamming /2 with "LFM 2 DPS DM Tribute Run"
---
Yeah man... Fucking annoying. Well at least we will miss the queues
---
Awesome. I assume a sub is needed to preload? Just a normal wow sub right?
---
The reason you say "wait for 3 sunders" is because everyone in the raid can see how many sunders have been successfully applied.
---
Shield slam and revenge can be missed/dodged/parried and there's no way to know if that's happened or not without either a voice call-out or some sort of combat log parser warning you.
---
It has nothing to do with sunder being the first/only ability used at the start of the fight.
---
*but every other add-on is ok!!*
---
tanking is shield slam, shield block, revenge, sunder.
---
soloing is mortal strike and sweeping strikes pretty much. Most guides tell them not to even bother leveling the skills
---
Says the guy making an argument with no back up
---
Night elf hunter plz
---
It requires less gear, is easier to play, and has greater health/threat than early warrior tanks.
---
It’s definitely a solid choice, but it just has a lower performance ceiling.
---
Tell me about it! I didn't start in Vanilla but I started in Wotlk (Dialup Aussie net made vanilla a no go) and the form quests were my favourite when I started, I'm eager to experience the game I had to watch my friends play.
---
TeamViewer is free and easy to setup and use
---
I want to play an rpg where im in danger of dying ... im sick of soulslike games give me some good old vanilla wow
---
At pre raid bis phase 1, activating shadow form will use like 35ish% of your mana lol. I think that’s what he means
---
 I know how tough it is for you right now, curled up lying in your own emotional vomit. You're in hell now, Boomhauer, and the only way out is through a long dark tunnel. And you're afraid to go in because there's a train coming at you, carrying a boxcar full of heartbreak. Well, let me tell you something: All you can do is let it hit you, and then try to find your legs. I know. I've taken that hit more times than I can remember. Look at me, Boomhauer. I'm fat, and I'm old, and every day I'm just going to wake up fatter and older. Yet somehow I manage to drag this fat old bald bastard out into the alley every day. I'm out there, digging holes, falling into them, climbing out, trying again. And tomorrow I'm going to hang outside at a ladies' prison, and the first thing those lady cons are going to see after twenty years is me. Will I get one? Experience says no. Will I be out there next month? If I'm alive, you'd better believe it. You've got to get up off that cannon bed, slip into a tight T-shirt, wash off some of that cologne, and get yourself out of that tunnel and into some strange woman's bed!
---
How's your back doing?
---
Probably the most retarded justification for the M/D date format I've ever read.
---
I don’t know a sub is needed to preload- might be the case. But yeah just the normal sub.
---
What about this [here!](https://youtu.be/GlP5G_o6i08?t=416)
---
Is the gamer you're talking about here Geoff "Incontrol" Robinson?
---
Just loop Green Day’s “Tired of Waiting For You” off Shenanigans
---
He very well could be, but based on the fact blizzard has more or less removed full gm positions like that several years ago, who knows.
---
Enter The Florpus was exactly what I expected from an Invader Zim mo "WHAT?!" an Invader Z "WHAT?!" an "WHAT?!" an Invader Zim mov "WHAT?!" … also lots of screaming
---
DM me this weekend if you have server ideas or at launch. Would love to level with a warlock.
---
Retail is going to keep selling expansions. Classic won't. Nothing more needs to be said.
---
ed checkin in
---
That makes me sad.
---
At the same time, itemization was really weird back then, and a lot of us just didn't know how to play/gear our classes.  Even in late game dungeons and early raids.  We just didn't know as much as we do now.
---
Dude was still a dick though.
---
Don't even worry about it, these people trying to mess with the market or whatever are morons.  In phase 1 with layering, it will be impossible to control every layer.  So actually cornering the market on raid consumable mats and devil leather isn't even realistic.  You think you have all the spawns, but then more players enter the zone a new layer is made, and they get to farm there.
---
Also if you are taking your time and enjoying the game, this will have no impact on you.  Hell even if you become a raider after a month or two of leveling up and having fun, it won't impact you almost at all.  While yes the devilsaur set is pre raid BIS, that doesn't mean you can't raid without the best gear.
---
Back in vanilla I joined a guild at level 58 as a rogue with greens.  We ran MC and cleared rag, I had no consumables and no gear and no clue how to play in a raid.  Just find some casual people to enjoy the game with, and ignore any dumb shit others are doing.  You will still have a great time, just try not to worry about what dumb dumb fucks are doing ya know, it doesn't have to ruin anything if you don't let it.
---
Yeaaaah if they bother to pay attention. A lot of my runs on private servers people ignored stuff like that a lot.
---
Considering the people who played extensively on nostalrius or such were (technically) enthusiasts, it makes me a little scared that classic will be absolute chaos as people who haven't bothered to read up on the game or anything will start hopping in.
---
That's kinda irrelevant to the discussion, it's just something I've been fearing from the start.
---
IIRC mages don't get the Darnassus teleport spell until level 30
---
oh no they exploited an irrelevant normal raid boss boohoo
---
I know exactly what it is and how it works. Parroting *how* it works like every other person on these forums as a means to defend it results in the same conclusion every time: people like you ignoring the point people are making about the damage this addon will do to the community. Like every minority of opinions on these forums, you know instinctually that yours is wrong, but because you want to use the addon you speak up for it and lament over the hive mind of “people that don’t know what it’s about” that just downvote brigade your posts. The reality is simply this: the majority of the community disagrees with you. Posts defending it are not getting gilded on the Top/Hot lists, the people speaking out against it are. Those posts are getting those awards because people agree with them, and upvote them as a result, giving them visibility for the rest of the majority that agrees it is a problem. Even the developers of this game would prefer it to not exist. You can defend this addon all that you want, try to make others feel like they are misinformed or simply ignorant, but in the end it will simply boil down to this: you are siding with a minority opinion. The majority of a forum that works similarly to a democracy disagrees with you. The developers of this game disagree with you. Blizzard will ban this addon, and will respect what the *majority* of the community wants for this matter, because it was the majority of a community who were *for* WoW Classic that created the uprising that resulted in this game being brought back at all.
---
TeamViewer, VNC, LogMeIn, and even the built in Windows one will work fine.
---
It's a slow road, you're really not going to be hurting too bad by not being able to start day 1, hour 1.
---
Haha watching his Warlock video now!
---
I've used that before, I could try it again I guess, but I wasn't very impressed last time, though that is a few years ago. Maybe I'm just remembering wrong.
---
As far as wand progression, check out Kargoz's Priest Leveling Guide [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qkfexjgWuZhNko5Ht94Qxxni2r1OIhFFBIWDxbhC5Wg/edit#slide=id.g4557a31599_0_0). Look at slides 34/35 for Alliance and 39 for Horde.

Grobbulus
---
No doubt, modern raids are the best wow themed mini games ever made.
---
underrated comment here
---
That would be the legend himself.
---
If you like pvp, you should seriously check out the Elementalist spec. It was really enabled by the 1.11 mage patch. This spec leverages uncapped AoE abilities and instant cast skills to take on multiple opponents while being somewhat protected from counter spells and interruptions.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVxGu0cuZVAM0o0th
---
There's room for customization in there, but it's built around shatter enabling both fire and frost to crit harder, while buffing your instant skills like Fireblast and CoC.
---
[https://imgur.com/j2cqiGv](https://imgur.com/j2cqiGv)
---
Hah. It's actually been killing me for a while, but that's mostly because I got fat and lazy. Started working out and losing weight again and it's already somewhat improving.
---
Good luck with that purity test. You'll walk a very lonely road if you refuse all guilds/groups that include players who still play retail.
---
In my dictionary, competitive and sandbox are mutually exclusive.
---
&gt; giving f for that shite. Last f was wotlk.
---
Wotlk definitely deserves a lower-case f. BC gets a full uppercase **F** with bold formatting.
---
Wrath was awesome, except that it's hard for me not to see it as "the beginning of the end" of WoW. All of the things I don't like about retail (questing on rails, item score, deep homogenization, no necessity for interation) almost **all** started with Wrath.
---
I'd consider playing a BC Classic, but I don't think I'd bother with Wrath.
---
Are you sure it wasn't an attempt to make the icons more "realistic?" Something more representative of the actual game experience?
---
They're using in-game models for the icons right? I don't think it's lazy. It's just a design decision that you disagree with. Y'all are just looking for a reason to be mad at Blizzard at this point.
---
Blammo is my favorite.
---
Even then you have to install it and log in to "activate" them.
---
Horrified? Didn't you use the old WoW forums?
---
god people like you are going to make classic the fucking worst. can you just not play it?
---
I have two options in the launcher: wow 1 BFA, wow 2: wow.
---
I assume the second?
---
Engineering isn't as useful for mages in PVE as it is for other classes. Goblin Sapper is basically just an Arcane Explosion consume for non-mages.
---
In addition, it shares talent builds of players in the list.
---
I was refreshing my memory on sample sizes in relation to margin of error within a survey.
---
I found this table to be helpful: [https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/sample-size-surveys](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/sample-size-surveys)
---
Of course, this assumes a RANDOM sampling from within a whole population, and there will be many biases in these demographics surveys (only reddit users, users prior to launch, etc.), but if we have a thousand or more respondents within a server, I think you can have some confidence in the results (at that time of sampling).
---
The gender tank gap for tauren is disgusting. Day 1 of classic I am organizing a tauANTIFA rally in mulgore. Be there or be a racist!
---
I've been looking for the name Sam on Zandalar Tribe for almost two weeks now and things are getting desperate. Time to open the vault. The offer on the wanted poster is accurate!
---
See you on the field, bucko!
---
Are those NElfs single?
---
Drop a freezing trap after the flare.
---
I think he was referring to work on Monday... some of us work for companies that don't give any PTO :(
---
So you're saying there's no chance any server will be shut down because of popultion? I'm just saying let's not let it be Bigglesworth.
---
I see where your coming from, and you are right to some extend. People need to stop refering to deadmines as VC.
---
In NA, Stalagg has been polling ahead of Herod on Reddit, too. This despite Blizzard continuing to warn that Herod is overcrowded. It'll be interesting to see whether Herod is actually more crowded - or if it simply got a ton of name reservations that won't actually be played.
---
So basically I should play with headphones on
---
I almost asked if Wow added tells...
---
Classic server is not available yet so he test it on the live server. It’s the same version that was released 3 days ago.
---
It communicates with other people with the addon via chat parsing lol..
---
How dare they want to gear themselves up after contributing hours to a raid. The AUDACITY!
---
the TEMERITY!
---
Ps: Horde has no retribution paladins.
---
Obviously speaking from my own perspective and talking to alot of friends of friends and how everyone got dragged in that is about the number.
---
Source ? Because I remember using a lot of addons back then
---
I lived those dark days. It was only fun for a bit, then got annoying as hell. 
---
Myself and a group of priests worked hard trying to clear ironforge on our server. We cleaned big sections of it but had no way to really prevent people from spreading it.
---
See, that would almost be a somewhat okayish argument if:
---
1. Anyone at all used that definition when referring to computer game expansions
---
2.  Tides of Darkness and The Frozen Throne didn't exist.
---
Otherwise you could fart and say "wow!" and that fart would be a wow expansion.
---
Yes. Gamers are the most oppressed group of people on the planet.
---
I bet those belts are going to be worth bank for the memes alone
---
Needs more bus shock
---
I played a Warrior solo for the first year of WoE back in 2004. Played as a Tank so I ended up making lots of friends in game.
---
But getting to 60 was an absolute chore.
---
Oh lol. Thank isn't a matchmaking ranking that matches you based on mmr. That is just a title for how long you play.
---
It all depends on the guild. All the content can be cleared without everyone using the best specs. The people who get into minmaxing are often in hardcore guilds that want to do speed clears. When I played in Vanilla my guild had no information on consumables, best specs, or world buffs and we cleared through BWL fine before I stopped playing. 
---
I think minmaxers will say it isn't good till AQ gear but if you want a decent hybrid you could go seal fate dagger. If you are a dagger rogue early there will be lots of weapons for you to take since most warriors and rogues will be competing for swords. I most PvP but here is something I would run: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305023105021351-302305-0502](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305023105021351-302305-0502) \- you can move the last two points in Elusiveness wherever.
---
I played druid to warlord, two weeks from high warlord, in classic. Druids are a blast once you are geared. Running the flag against a good team is a rush like no other. 
---
World pvp is amazing. You can stealth and have the ability to track humanoids. Backup healing and battle ressurection. Bear form destroys most melees. 
---
Druids bring a ton of utility to any situation. 
---
Can't speak to the other classes though.
---
Just pay for the insanely expensive internet on the plane.  It's worth it just once so you can play WoW on the IRL gryphon.  I played on Nost back in the day flying from the US to Germany.  It was a blast.  Totally lucked out and had a whole row of 3 seats to myself which made it even better!
---
As if we needed more reasons to stay off of the official forums. They were bad in wrath I can only imagine they are far worse now.
---
You can only track one gathering prof at a time 
---
You could do tailoring and enchanter
---
I'm not an AddOn author - just a regular programmer - but I thought the exact same thing. While I don't know specifics on their inner workings I couldn't fathom how they would go on about disabling an addon like this.
---
Even the auto invite is based on whisper text so there's just nothing they could do. It would break the WHOLE addOn ecosystem which is also NOT classic.
---
We'll simply have to deal with it. I suppose that this GM response is simply not accurate and more guesswork than anything else.
---
That's only for the PvP servers. The PvE servers has god-awful names on EU
---
Christ almighty, this is some juicy drama.
---
This thread and the previous one should definitely be used in a social research comparison to political discussions. It’s interesting the perspective and reasons from both sides. One side feels the LFD function even the early one that was rarely used led to the fall of the social part of WoW and worries this may lead to that path while the other argues the convenience and how it won’t ruin it without any evidence from both sides. This is literally how every debate starts and this shit is getting ugly.
---
retail will have 10x the player base of classic 3 months after release.
---
less than 10% of the name reserved accounts on classic servers rn will hit 60. you all are going to be shocked, WoW classic isn't that fun
---
If it wasn't going by so quickly I would agree, but on close to launch the spam fest going through LFG is going to be insane.  You will have magnitudes more on release this time than originally per server as they have already stated.
---
Until 1pm (EST) that's when they unlock all 10 slots so be ready with 7-15 potential extra names you forwent to get your main 3
---
Someone please do this and link it here. Thanks.
---
The gestures make it look like a real picture.. awsome!
---
6pm.....
---
When you're all lvl 15 and the warrior has no rage it's not a good idea to pull because I will have absolutely no way of getting aggro.
---

You should act your age, then.

Critique of retail WoW flip-flops between "they catered to the casual playerbase" and "they did things no one wanted" depending on whichever argument works better in a given scenario.
---
Thanks i guess im retarded
---
It's already been mentioned but I'm going EN for the wand at 5 or whatever it is, then probably dropping for a couple gathering professions until 60.
---
Haha same here
---
32k  members perhaps, shared over 4 servers, with 8 layers per server, and only 1/3rd online at a time suddenly the odds even out
---
No it doesn’t, it reads and posts to the same channel you would use to find groups, it doesn’t affect anyone not using the addon at all.
---
Still funnier than this subreddit by far
---
Personally I dig the title. But I can see how others wouldn't be down with it.
---
You can 2 hand tank until 40 with some creative builds and good gameplay.  At 40 when warriors get to wear plate the damage ramps up considerably.  The shield will be necessary to block large portions of incoming damage as that is how warrior tank spec was designed.  It was ballanced around damage mitigation. And extra armor from your shield.  If you want to 2 handed tank go for a druid who's survivability is based around a greater health pool and regeneration.  
---
Warriors in classic are incredibly fun and incredibly frustrating.  You distance closer out of combat is charge but it doesn't work well on moving targets.  In combat you will have to switch to berzerker stance, intercept, bloodrage, and return to defensive for the survivability.  It makes for a fun and active playstyle.  Give it a shot and tell us what you find out.  Maybe we've been doing it wrong for 15 years. 
---
You can find me as the holy dps priest stacking spirit and laughing in the 8 minute fights while everyone else is out of Mana.
---
Yea, I’m sure the community wouldn’t get outraged at customer service tickets being totally ignored. Get real.
---
and no one wants to play with your greasy virgin gatekeeping ass. i can smell the cheetos through your reddit comments. god people like you are literally the worst. like literally the worst, you suck dude.
---
lol, good luck dude.  I will camp you.
---
lol. He deleted his comments now I think
---
In the bnet launcher, select WoW, and then right above the play/install button, there is a dropdown menu to select which version (retail/classic). You only need an active sub to play classic.

The pserver boys that will banned for doing pserver shenanigans are going to learn the hard way.

Warcraft iii is pretty awesome both story wise and gameplay wise.  In some ways it’s a giant advertisement for wow.
---
Damn man ... This post just got me fucking hyped
---
guise my gf totes made this wow cake for me!! upboats to the left!!
---
WC3 is the OG. WCI was okay and WCII was great but WC3 was responsible for DOTA, Tower Defense, and World of Warcraft among others.
---
Depending on how layering works and competition in the starting zones; I predict Lesser Magic Wands around 2 hours and Greater Magic Wands in 5 hours.
---
During the stress test I leveled as a priest with a warrior. I haven't played on vanilla private servers and I didn't have any practice just a rough outline of what to do. I followed Joanas leveling guide and hit level 14 in 12 hours. At level 14 I went back to Darnasuss to train skills and leveled up enchanting. I got to 70 enchanting and I had enough materials to craft 5 Greater Magic Wands.
---
Anyone who has already planned and tested a route would be able to do it significantly faster.  Anyone that has other players feeding them linen cloth will be able to do it very fast.  
---
The only requirement for Greater Magic Wand is level 5 (to learn the professions) and ~200 linen cloth. It took me 192 linen until I was enchanting 42 and had enough dust to get the rest of the levels until 70. (Enchant Bracer - Minor Health gives 1 skill up per dust until level 70)
---
It s as if people didn't play vanilla and complain anyway x)
---
Yeah, that's happened way too much.
---
Though countered again by opening with sap :P
---
Even with bloodvine I don't think we get hit capped though.. And bloodvine isn't until phase 4 when they release zg?
---
ikr?
---
Because it's named after Mr. Bigglesworth, and there's a wow superstition about RNG and killing him/letting him die.
---
Ty
---
I think race changes are ok because people will want to do it at some point, and it provides Blizzard an easy and non-game breaking way to earn money.
---
It isn't great, but it doesn't really affect your game play experience if someone else changes their race. Their items don't change, their mounts don't change to something gaudy. In BFA anyone can buy a dragon to ride. That should be earned, not bought.
---
If you don't give them *some* way to increase profits, they will add all the cosmetic bullshit that BFA became.
---
My personal guess is that they wanted to use in-game models. An attempt at being more honest about what the player will get by selecting that race. 
---
Unless those aren't the in-game models and then idk.
---
WC3 and TFT are pretty important to play before WoW! You’ll enjoy it a lot more.
---
We all love happy endings
---
Oh my god

Changed it to ''

For now. Not sure if its better tbh.

I haven't seen 50 dkp minus in like 10 years but as soon as I read "odd groups go left, even groups go right" it immediately came rushing back lol

Try Mankrik, the Discord server hasn't seen a lick of drama, there are no streamers rolling there, and the community seems REALLY friendly so far.
---
People are all for that authentic experience until it's something that bothers them

\#nochanges btw
---
Had a guy during the stress test killing mobs in my area, had to kill like 15 harpies.  I invited him and he declined.  Saw another dude and we grouped up.  The boss of the cave was one of the only mobs left in there, and he started to ask us for an invite once we tagged the mob.  We did not let him in.
---
Is there a special addon that's not listed to get the blacked out unitframes? I use a similiar look on retail that I would like in Classic as well, like this with the thick class colored hp bar: https://i.imgur.com/kACCsTy.png

As is tradition

They actually make diapers with melted chocolate in them and you have to eat the chocolate.  It’s like a party gag I think

Imo if you dont mind eating the same thing often, slow cooker/stovetop chilies, curries etc are the absolute best for game launches.
---
Some take like 30 minutes total of prep and you can get 6+ meals out of them AND they can be super healthy
---
The crazy part is Final boss was gonna roll on my server, but somehow had a grob discord made two weeks ago? This whole thing fucking reeks, especially with the shills posting 'they were just trying to expose a bad thing' -- I'm not buying it at all.
---
If you can't, you're awful. Rage+GCDs=threat, so there's always a limit on the threat that can be generated, and it's invariably lower than the damage that can be done at each stage of the game/gear. Like, you're setting yourself a challenge which is 'I'm going to see how badly I can do my job'.
---
yep. they ruined every single thing. looks, animations, sounds... theres 0 weight in the tauren movement in retail. instead of making completely new animations they ruined the old ones by making everything extremely bouncy.
---
I learned to hide on the boat on pvp servers, or find low level hordes that are hiding :D
---
For sure but there's surely going to be a wait regardless.
---
Skinning is nice just to build up that Bank for your mount at 40. Just vendor the stacks since there won't be much money in the community yet for sales on the auction house.
---
How relevant though

---
The "other' option used to be a joke.
---
Leveling to 60 and quite a lot of 60 stuff can be done solo.
---
Any kind of dungeon, or raid content, need friends for that.
---
There are also group quests which can be done solo by a few classes, but it's not easy.
---
The game is heavily socially based, so may as well make new friends along the way. See someone doing the same quest as you? Invite them to a group. Makes things go faster if you are no longer competing for the same mobs, and you can share credit.
---
My question is what will the LFG addon do? I dont think there was such thing as a suggest invite button at that time...Does it whisper the person and ask to join?
---
damn thats a lot of countries, but Im just waiting for those Northern Cypriots and Transnistrians to pipe up for recognition lol.
---
Since you can't dualweild I have to say no.
---
What does that mean? Am I supposed to use ICQ?
---
It looks like fun tbh, as speed levelling is not necessary for me. Can I find an order for the talents when levelling for this build?
---
spooky
---
They better still sell it if not classic is ruined
---
The addon communicates through a specific channel- if you look at the source for the addon the messages go through CLFG_Network. 
---
So how about an Addon that communicates through the same network but consistently passes around the “GroupDelisted” event? Just reading through the source code it seems like other players could cripple the addon. Pretty malicious but possible.
---
Classic may not be the game for you then.
---
Resto Druid is a solid healer, but Feral is sub-par for dps.  IMO Feral druids are the best dungeon tanks, but there are better options for both tanking and dps in raids.
---
Balance Druid isn't a thing.
---
Why is that? I didn't see anything bad?
---
I thought we were all about \#nochanges in this place?!

He's out of breath because he is old, has short legs and hauls that big ass staff around.

Well, then.  It seems this was gearing up to be a battle of wits.  I was mistaken, you have come unarmed.  
---
You may return to your basement now.

I looked it up, I believe you are correct. To get the set bonus you must be a 300 Tailor
---
VuhDo can probably do what you want.  You could do all kinds of shit with it.
---
I played boomkin in og and loved it, but fair warning, your staff/rings/etc are second to any mage/lock and your t1/t2 is second to all resto druids, even when clearing mc and bwl each week it was tough to get gear. Hope you have fun regardless tho, and good luck to you!
---
im betting most of these people never played vanilla and are trying to port over their private server experience.

call to arms existed in vanilla.  none of this shit is new

---
The servers are being shut down and reset right before they launch so anyone trying this is going through be booted anyways.
---
Best you can do (from the mouth of Blizzard) is to login "minutes" before launch and reach the Character select screen and wait for the Enter Work button to light up.
---
Awesome. Thanks for taking the time to provide me with a link!
---
I love slow cooking and rich sauces like you're describing. Will get to work on Sunday!
---
Oh damn I miss read it XD. Lavas sounds alright. I just read a bit about bloods and I think it might be a bit too click intensive to play wow at the same time. The mining of the essence is okay but you have to chisel something too apparently
---
I don't suppose you'd be interested in rolling PvE?
---
I'm a rogue and I'll save your ass if you're about to die to a mob and even help you complete a chicken escort if convenient.
---
There's no room for hate in my heart.

You can't put a weapon in offhand. You need dual wield for that.
---
You go to somewhere to farm linen at level 6.(when you leave the starter zone) I recommend the place north of the exit of the starter zone for undead. You farm until you have about 20 linen. While your farming you take note of other priests farming linen. When you have 20, send one of them the message "Hey you doing tailoring and enchanting to make a wand? I'll trade you 20 linen for one". One of the priests will definitely agree.
---
Spinned it 11 times to get Warlock Affliction. It is destiny then!

---
The problem for the Mafia is that their Cross-faction shenanigans are against the ToS and they will be banned if they do that.
---
It's not the same like on a P-server where the Admins either don't care or they were bribed.
---
I mean, the arena playerbase is not necessarily the same as the people that want open world pvp. I really like arena (or did for a long time) in retail, but hated world pvp, mostly because certain gear disparaties became so large, certain trinkets so powerful, etc.
---
I will play on a PVP realm in classic because it feels right though, but I just wouldn't draw parallels between constructed, opt-in pvp in retail and world pvp.
---
On the first night, its surely going to be bad. Nobody is going to be logging off so the queue wont be moving. YIKES
---
Surely they can just target the LFG channel within the API.
---
Well if people can't prove it I'm not hoping on the /#CancelCulture bandwagon.
---
I get your point about doxxing, but "I can't I'll get in trouble" isn't enough to pick up a pitchfork for. Anyone participating in the hate boner is just bored and looking for something to be angry about.
---
Is there anywhere else that we can find server population data?
---
This is a garbage answer and you know it.  When you are filling out 40 people you aren't telling hunters to go away just because they are hunters.
---
So if you did that at home on wifi. You're fine. You're within your network. The second you go to the coffee shop and attempt this, you will have to setup what's called port-forwarding on your router to your PC's IP and open 3389 to **the entire internet**. Any traffic that hits your router (it has a public IP) on that port will be forwarded to your computer. Therefore, if someone uses a port scanner on your public IP, they can see if that port is open. If they see that port open... if they have bad intentions, they could start attempting to log into your computer.  
---
You don't know if your Microsoft email/password combination has been compromised yet. They could already have bought it off of the deep web if there was a leak we don't find out until next year.

---
I think that's the most amazing part is by yelling over and over again about trying to ban or remove this addon, those same people have just cemented it.
---
im gonna give it a shot, no arena, and ive heard the raids are a joke, but i will give it a try
---
I want to know if any of these addons will cause unnecessary lag on the servers, with them pinging one another constantly
---
https://github.com/DomenikIrrgang/ClassicLFG/blob/master/src/gui/create-group.lua
---
There's an auto invite checkbox I assume does something
---
For Horde the issue was that your damage scaled like shit with gear. And most shamans had priority over you.
---
A good hunter is usually very rare.
---
They bring great utility for raids tho. Kinda like ret paladins.
---
The reactions that people get just for suggesting minor QoL additions on the main forums really reminds me of my favorite character from the movie PCU:
---
 https://imgur.com/abhBvJQ.jpg
---
&gt; Sure technically a full shadow priest or enhancement shaman can heal, but once you get out of the baby dungeons it's not such a great idea.
---
I healed at 60 as feral, all the way into Naxx.
---
Swapping gear makes a huge difference. Talents just amplify your abilities or give you other options - like you said healing tide.
---
Save yourself some pain, level as damage, swap at 60, but make sure you collect healing gear along the way and keep it current.
---
You did his guild a favor. In most of the raid guilds I've been in, if someone in the guild pulled that kind of shit, there would have been a short private discussion with an officer followed by a mutual (or not) understanding that it was high time to quit our guild and go find a different one (or not).
---
I'm beginning to think that unfortunately.
---
I'd like to see your source on 8+hour queues.
---
Never in the history of WoW has there been 8 hour queues. I've been there at every launch and the most I've ever seen was about 45 mins on Illidan server during BC.
---
It is a tank weapon at heart. 
---
The dps gains are noticable for sure. The proc is also nice for added damage. 
---
But the value a tank gets out of thunderfury is huge and allows for the raid to start sooner and burn harder which results in vastly more damage then what a single rogue would gain with it in his off hand.
---
LEFT SIDE. MANY WHELPS!!!!
---
But cross faction collusion is bannable
---
Ok but it's competitive and even top dps on some fights so it's not "garbage", that's a ridiculous narrative.
---
I have no hopes of getting much done in the first 2 days. I work all afternoon until 9-10 at night. IF I get in I'll be unlocking as many FP's as possible after a good half hour on top of the Org bank.
---
Good. I really hope this LFG thing gets blocked from classic. It takes away from the social aspects of the server greatly. Go play BFA if you want addons. There will be so many discord channels and server specific forums to post in if you are having issues getting a group. Please don't make it an in game feature though.
---
If you thought about it 2 seconds with your little brain, making a post about it and giving the addon attention is infact promoting whether you want it or not.
---
That doesnt happen on blizzard servers. It's a pserver problen
---
Those flaws are not considered flaws by the people who championed very hard to see wow classic come back.
---
If classic frustrates you, it's not for you.  Retail is for you.
---
Depends on your time zone. It’s a global launch.

I’ll buff everyone with AI, but please don’t get greedy with food / water. You get what I give. I’m not making you 2 stacks while I’m grinding.
---
&gt;Alright, but Ferals in PVP are viable right? Or are they just significantly weaker than other classes?
---
Not really viable... you can chip away at their health, heal yourself up, and then do that for about 5 minutes before one of you runs away... kidding/not kidding. 
---
Druids have a rough go in classic...its sad, but true.

It's like they forced 'em all to drink soy milk ever since Vanilla

So according to Ythisens, GM names are only ever used once, and if you do a twitter search for the GM's name, there's one thanking Blizz CS on twitter from 2013 for the Gm's support, suggesting he is actually a GM.
---
Anyway you could also add a class choice breakdown per server in v5?
---
It’s so strange that I didn’t learn this until legion. But it’s important to keep in mind it’s just PVE, Not PVP targets
---
Yeah but on pservers the mods didn't give a shit about cross faction collusion.  That's bannable on Blizzard servers.  Also, I'm reasonably certain that most of the mafia was involved in RMT which is why they were so motivated to keep the mafia going.  That's another bannable offense on Blizz servers so less motivation for a lot of people to keep the mafia going indefinitely.

You’re the only one

Portals Portals Mage

---
It will be important to be upfront with your teammates about your deep ele tree. You wont get mana tide totem which is huge for group dynamics and survive-ability. Your statistics on healing will be consistantly lower, by a large margin, from full resto shamans. The point of raiding is putting up talents that help the whole group. Honestly the guild will have to be pretty casual to accept a split shaman. I would respec maybe once every week to farm for consumables as full ELEMENTAL on the weekends. The gold you farm should be enough to cover respec back and pots for the next weeks raids, but that was in a semi hardcore guild.

Seems like a dumb argument.  Youre about to play a completely different patch than release.  Lots of stuff wasnt in the ORIGINAL release.  Thankfully, you're sitting by yourself in a sandbox while the rest of the kids want to play the good version of vanilla.  #youdontunderstand#nochanges
---
The difference being, a random mob doesn’t have the conscience  of being an asshole that camps your corps
---
Invite any player you see in your quest areas. I spent most of the stress test in a group from this.
---
Wow this is SO AMAZING!
---
My vote is the prototypical T2.5 Orc Fury Warrior
---
Extrapolation. Polls of a couple thousand people like this sub has made are going to be decently good estimates.
---
Id happily trade places with you, all I do is refresh new, the wait is killing me
---
Keep in mind that a lot of people will drop off in the first few months. If a full server goes down to high pop it's not a big deal. A medium server going down to low will not attract new players and runs the risk of being a dead server. No transfers in classic either.
---
This one looks interesting link please?
---
Would be impossible to focus if I stayed at home, so I took the week off from work.  Flying to Chicago to be near the east coast datacenter, and reserved a private office at a coworking location that has a shower and couch available.  Plan is to hit 60 during the first week (hopefully with a /played of &lt; 5.5 days and /slept of the balance) not sure if possible, with high pop servers, if not, will maybe level two toons to 40 and bank some rested bonus
---
Here's a guy who thinks 'sequel' means 'expansion'.
---
The war between us hunters and the rest of Azeroth has already begun.
---
it never goes to the dps.
---
always goes for tank warriors.
---
it's the best in slot tank weapon in the game.
---
My actual first character was a dwarf hunter, but my first high level was a dk. I fully intend on maining the hunter again just to relive some of those moments that I’ve had before. Also I miss a lot of the aspects of hunter that are no longer in the game like ammo and pet happiness levels. During the last stress test, I actually ran out of ammo in the back of the windigo cave and would’ve died if it wasn’t for another fellow hunter who showed up and got aggro on all of them to help me escape
---
absolutely based and  unapologetically redpilled
---
It’s off GCD though and scales with SP. So it’s a still a pretty big deal but yeah the difference in sapper dps on an aoe fight is more noticeable on classes without spammable aoe.
---
I think the people that say that, want to play classic wow as a sort of fantasy fulfillment. They want to vanilla wow to be how it was in 2004-2006. I am one of those people : /
---
No trading gold from bfa for classic gold.
---
The simple fact is all blizzard has said is they could be 'several hours'.
---
Stop making up numbers and posting other numbers that are speculation as fact.
---
Could it be 10 hours?  Maybe, who knows.  Could it be one hour?  Maybe, who knows.  
---
The simple fact is we dont know how long it will be, and Blizzard doesnt really, either.  A lot of characters have been created, it just all depends on how many of those people try to log in at launch.
---
Undead rogue!
---
First product with an 11 NPS
---
Just a guess. I feel like that's where only the most dedicated and hardcore players will play.
---
Wow, an ad like that for a couple of hours is really that cheap? That's pretty interesting.
---
The basic idea is that a wand shot doesn't cost mana and only takes 0.5s to cast. The general downside is that after shooting it procs a GCD, meaning you need to take this GCD into account when you calculate your DPS.
---
BUT, if you need to move just after your wand shot, the GCD should not be added because that's just movement time that would have happened either way. And in general, after a nova, you walk MORE than just a GCD (you want to be further away from the mob). So the idea here is to use the GCD of the wand to start your movement, follow it with nova, continue your movement for the GCD of your nova and then frostbolt (and/or wand to death when the mob has low life).
---
That means your wand does its full damage for zero mana and a cast of 0.5s (so its true DPS is full damage times 2 if you want to compare with your forstbolt). That's a very good deal.
---
Stop trying to convert non druids. Moonglade isn’t big enough, we will have to build a wall soon.
---
But why would you tho
---
I played warrior in vanilla, I stopped playing at about level 30 in 2006

---
Not necessarily, a future alt can get you all if you want to just farm stuff. On the other hand if you are not committed to max leveling enchanting just put that on an alt and mail boes to it to disenchant and make wands early.
---
A spec like this will allow you to heal in raids and ret while not. It’ll be fine up until you go into AQ honestly.
---
Hey great stuff man, this is great data to peruse, thanks for putting in the time :)
---
The only server transfers that I could support are "Free Server Transfers" that are offered for specific realm/faction combinations in order to preserve faction balance and realm population balance.
---
They did have these in 2004/2005 for certain realms that had issues.
---
&gt; Once shit like BWL is on farm expect to see more dps paladins, shaman, and priests as well as druids
---
For sure, as the content moves on as well, gear for hybrids become more suited for hybrids (such as druid in AQ40 gear)
---
Do game developers (particularly for WoW) still enjoy their jobs? I'm sure to some extent they do. Do they have the same magic as when WoW was first being developed? I really doubt it. The churn rate at these companies are extremely fast for everything, including both content and employees. Most people in the game development profession don't stay at one company for more than a few years. And their creative tendencies are extremely limited by things that they are required to include in the game. WoW has always been a business, but the balance of business and game has obviously been shifted toward one side for a while now.
---
Dagothur will be my bank toon. It's just too perfect.
---
Man it's so sad to admit it but the passionate team of young developers, that don't really know what they're doing but are having a ton of fun, is no more. Now Blizz only thinks by money and any "little thing" that is worthless to their eyes goes to scrap. Turns out these little things were making the game so great and now look at how Retail is going.
---
Lots of fruit and nuts.
---
Lots of Water.
---
Some junk food to keep morale up.
---
Pizza and Tacos for those greasy dinners.
---
They should just do a full reboot. Start with classic and continue forward, correcting mistakes and improving game play along the way.
---
If you're duoing just have the war go mining/skinning for funds
---
Whatever snacks I have on hand for my 5 year old. So probably goldfish, apples, and veggie crsips 😅
---
No they are not dude lol, 4+ hour queues actually happen idk why that's so hard to believe.  I have personally experienced them especially on the Wotlk and Cata expansions, I literally couldn't play until the next day. 
---
If YOU have never experienced these, that's great, but acting like they have never happened and all those screenshots are just glitches is you being EXTREMELY ignorant off of your anecdotal experience.  Sorry but it's true
---
https://i.imgur.com/XtLjTMl.jpg
---
I recommend crafting your lesser magic wand like others have said. Then drop a prof for skinning. 
---
1 skinning is an extra boost to your gold, which helps you get your mount on-time at 40. 
---
2 leveling profs slows down your leveling speed. Even if you're not speed running (I'm definitely not), it makes leveling a lot more smooth and efficient. 
---
3 profs are a gold sink.
---
4 you can level profs a lot faster at max
---
If you really want to level one up, go skinning/tailoring. You will have the opportunity to make bags and occasionally gear for yourself.
---
Every damn day. Cant decide if I want the black straps on my undead's face or not
---
Why do you only have access to wifi?
---
Amen
---
We already have a wall, and we have bears literally guarding the entrance!
---
But uh there is a lfg tool I'm classic...at the summoning stones
---
In vanilla 40 was max, so it'd be easy to google the wrong thing and get the wrong answer. Quit being a dick lol
---
if this isn’t installed through various disks i’ll be dissapointed
---
yeah the second one in particular is fine for raiding
---
Now take that painting and sell it at Christie's for 1000$
---
Sounds like they’ll be babysitting. Should ask if the MIL can cook for you so you don’t have to get up.
---
Have a phone as backup 👌🏻
---
&gt; Of course i dont mean to do world first.
---
He's not being a dick.  Half of the people that reply here act like they're going to be worldfirsting and you're a scrub if you don't use a minmax spec.
---
Get some bulk nuts!! Good fats in them.
---
I literally said this to my roommate 2 minutes ago
---
Was planning on rolling 30/0/21 shaman. Spun the wheel and right off the bat I got shaman - elemental. Close enough to confirm that yes indeed I will be playing a shaman
---
Boy howdy just wait til you learn what Timezones are.
---
Your post kind of reads like: "Yeah man, I was hyped before being hyped was cool, now it's so mainstream, I am over it, reserved a name, might delete later, idk"
---
Your post is quite immature, I'm inclined to think you your self are the man-child. There is a valid concern that addons like lfg addons can diminish the experience of the game due to taking away some of the effort needed to find a group. Look at addons like gear score or raider io that pretty heavily effected / effect the game. Do I think this will ultimately ruin anything, no but there is still a concern. The poster is entitled to have an opinion just as you are. At least he is not name calling and being rude to others.
---
More like 3pm
---
I can only hope that these surveys are just indicative of a small percentage of people and it’s not a small preview of what it’ll be like come live. There are thousands upon thousands that don’t vote, don’t browse reddit/this sub or don’t care about which faction has better racials. I’m hoping those people can even the factions out, not just in pvp servers but all across the board.
---
When used on retail yes, the creator said the function will not be available in classic.
---
I leveled a rogue recently, combat is faster because you never stealth and don't have to distract mobs (30 second cd). I leveled as sub, using 100 energy on gouge - bacstab to do about 30% of a mobs hp then having to pool again did not feel great. It did however feel like a rogue instead of a fury warrior with no charge.
---
Oooo. Baron Rivendare would be fun.
---
What about me? I think the add-ons whatever and everyone is overreacting. The people complaining are the people who probably won't see mc raids for 6 months after release.
---
We need a bigger one, one to keep all the raping and murdering furbogs out!
---
Your rotation is pretty easy buddy.
---
Seal of crusader, judgement, seal of command. Wait until dead.
---
Replenish crusader when necessary, judge command when they are stunned.
---
Says the uneducated moron. He's sick af. Looks it.
---
You on the other hand are a shit troll. An asshole and a lot more.
---
This is actually a good argument on why Tail/Skinn are good starting proffessions. I will start with Tail/Ench, craft my Wand, then drop Ench for Skinn.
---
For point 1. I think druids are very good tank healers. Healing touch is mana efficient with good gear and down ranking. And it is the single largest heal in the game with rank 11. That is the definition of hard hitting. I think it's easier to sit on a tank target than to try to raid heal and get out-sniped by faster flash healers.
---
So, here's the problem with server transfers: PvP servers exist.
---
Take PvP server A on which Horde is in a stronger position. This may be all fun and games for a while but sooner or later, many Alliance players might get tired of getting ganked all the time and then they transfer off to Server B, where Alliance is in a more favourable position.
---
This is tipping the scales on Server B and now a l ot of Horde players say "Screw this, I'm transferring to Server A where I won't gvet ganked all the time".
---
Sooner, rather than later, we're back at 9:1 ratio faction ghetto servers where no World PvP can exist.
---
Anything is possible. I suspect most guilds will be excited to have 40 warm bodies all pointed in the right direction, and will worry about rigid class breakdowns later.
---
That smile really butters my eggroll.
---
Human Paladin T2 with Lok'amir il Romathis and Red Dragonscale Protector might be cool :P
---
Even if the addon had auto invite, who would use it? Sounds like an easy way to get 5 dps groups. Classic doesn't have the same kind of role definition built into the game, is there even any way to restrict who joins based on spec or class?
---
I remember following the footprints in the sand at night, only to come across a massive skeleton atop a hill, with the full moon set perfectly behind it. Wish I still had my old screenshots. I think the skeleton was a giant kodo, but I could be wrong.
---
Less toxic garbage and political bullshit at least.. that's my hope.
---
Salty?
---
I didn't start hyping myself until yesterday, so there's still plenty of room for this hype to grow between now and Tuesday. I refuse to let my hype die until I've been waiting in queue for 16 hours. You know, the classic experience.
---
I don't even RP but this is cool.
---
Not mine.  My hype meter is full and has been for several weeks, which is making the wait go horrifically and painfully slow :/
---
LAN party? Or do they play alliance?
---
You can still achieve an LFG system using only a mesh network of user nodes and friendslists, that's what oQueue did. It still achieves isolation but it cannot prevent the addon from working.
---
Can you please not include the question will your focus be on PvE or PvP? I feel like it's against the spirit of classic. Vanilla wasn't segregated between PvP and PvE players everyone just played. There were reasons to PvE as a PvP and vice versa. I feel like almost everyone is going to PvE to get gear and obviously if you're on a PvP server you're going to PvP.
---
Existing now? Server transfers have always been around. Even in Vanilla.
---
I believe it was called Green Led Walls. You'll only get this price at certain times and intervals though. Ramps up quickly if you want higher visibility.
---
That's a shit response.
---
Man these are annoying
---
But that's the reason why we have so many active people chilling here at the moment lol..
---
Yeah, you're right, anything will run to the healers if they try to keep a squishy alive and you've only had 1 gcd with it. If it died before it got there I'd do every pull the same way, let the mage 'tank' the first kill.
---
But now you do - apparantly.
---

---
paid transfers are the only thing that makes sense here... who knows how the population will be impacted after 6+ months of classic being out.  Would be nice to have insurance against playing on a dead server.
---
Are any of the builds you listed serviceable in World PvP? I'm curious about theorycrafting a bear oriented PvP spec/gear set specifically. Or a worse Rogue cat build focused on crits?
---
Must be really good friends with them to get the wand :(
---
You know you aren't forced to buy the devilsaur set to enjoy the game ? I'm not planning to take part of any mafia but i would like having one on my server, would made some interesting world pvp.
---
All I hear is excuses... idle for hours in org to wait for a group? That's not how it worked
---
I know it's the best race for the class, but a dwarf priest will always look out of place to me.
---
Hoobastank? Creed? Those don't belong with KoRn and Slipknot.....come on man!!
---
Uhh, I'm not assuming shit. Literally two comments up you said:

---
&gt;
---
&gt;"Want to tank SM?" 
---
/who isn't restricted to people in your field of view or even zone.

I guess just remember you can de stuff on an alt. Its a waste of skillpoints though.
---
Every fucking day.
---
I hope you're right but I haven't seen anyone link the part of the ToS that says it is actually 100% bannable.
---
Yes, we ran a guild back in TBC and got some server firsts for hosting pug groups for Black Temple Illidan kills with more than half pugs listening to instructions.
---
Does anyone remember how bad the Male Night Elf running animation was at first? It was so bouncy Blizzard had to “fix” it. They still bounce like a motherfucker though.
---
Cmon dude, let‘s be real. That would broken.
---
Much like everything comparing retail to vanilla, it’s lost it’s soul.
---
I play rogue too so for you the chance just doubled, servical
---
Long weekend after this one i cannot wait.
---
I think dwarf is the least played alliance race if I remember seeing past stats right.  I guess people just don't like them for some reason and warrior is open to every race so lots of competition.  Personally, I think dwarf is hands down the best looking alliance option.  Stick to dwarf warrior!  You gotta look at your character for a LOT of hours. :)
---
Ironically, Classic WoW is going to be "the hot new thing" in online gaming for a few weeks.
---
It's not an issue now. Only a vocal minority that don't understand the difference between this and the LFG in retail are making a big deal about it.  
---
Most people can plainly see that this doesn't pose any issues to anyone. You can use or or not use it, it doesn't affect the other side at all.  
---
You all just need something to complain about it feels like.
---
lol that only happened really early on, right?
---
What? It’s horde vs alliance lol
---
Agreed, but in this instance cosmetics wouldn't work for classic. You're the second person to bring up the wording of that part though so i'll edit it to clarify what I mean.
---
Hi, the sandbox does not modify the game files on disk. The launcher makes the client connect to the sandbox by modifying the executable in memory. But WoW started with the launcher does not connect to Blizzard services so it is save to use. There are some files stored in the WoW folder. One is a config to connect to the sandbox, the original config is not modified. The other files are the addon/interface settings that people want. These files are created by WoW and stored in the WTF folder. You can delete that folder after you copied/moved the settings if you want. You can also delete the special config file if it makes you feel safer.
---
No one was banned for using the sandbox. You might have heared of bans caused by the Arctium launcher. Those bans were for the custom file loading launcher that modifies the retail client to load custom models. But all those bans were reverted after a few hours.
---

Make sure you’re running an i7 9900k and 64gb of DDR4. You will then be able to have many many many chrome tabs open on pornhub, as you go.

If you DC and log back in before the game despawns ur character u get in without a queue, if you take to long u ned to queue again. Also if you properly close the game you have to go back into the queue

You can gank if you want to.

You can leave your friends behind.

Because your friends don't gank,

and if they don't gank,

then the're no friends of mine.

Hahaha.

It's true OP, we are your friends now :)
---
Ironically I can find several posts with links to blue posts saying that eastern servers are in Chicago, while I only find one post claiming they are all in LA, but there are very convincing comments disproving this.
---
I think they will have a system in place for what addons are able to function not so much how they function.
---
But thats just a guess from an ape who works construction lol
---
Never was a problem for us. The bridge to drak’s room in UBRS comes to mind. Sap sprint to the tank sheep trap.
---
This is next level dedication
---
STV will be on fire, just like the Amazon in real life.
---
4 gold for 1 quest! Yeah maybe in a few expansions
---
This was more an ironic sad "I have to wait till 6pm" but was poorly executed...
---
Prove what ?
---
I had feelings like that. That *feeling* slowly drained and the excitement wasn’t 110% then something popped into my head about classic and the feeling came back instantly. I think you’ll be just fine lol, your body just can’t take 24/7 hype, it’s built a tolerance.
---
Every single person involved in this should be immediately permanently banned. End of discussion.
---
Honestly exactly what I was thinking, didn’t wanna regret my choice later on as a lvl 45 or something :/I might end up running warrior myself as well, being it’s supposed to be the preferred tanking class in vanilla. Only question left is faction. Hm.. I’m choosing for two people here lol, hope I make the right decision.

It's one drop down menu man. In the same tab as the live game...

Why would they put in effort to reimagine, advertise, and publish this game and then hide it so no one would play it?

As far as ELEMENTAL gear went, it would drop occasionally, after about 4-5 months of raiding every shaman had a lot of good ele specific gear. However necklaces rings and weapons went to pure dps first so takes a bit on some items.
---
This is me  and my brother! orc shaman myself. Undead warrior my bro!
---
Yep. I've been banned on retail for botting multiple times, so several strikes on my account. Even then, my latest ban which was sorta early Legion was only a 6month one. I think perm bans are for the sort of people who run 20 bots at a time, or other such really bad faith agents.
---
I always made sure to frontload as a hunter. Aimed shot, auto and multi can all hit within half a second, right as the tank pulls. 
---
Just make sure you feign death *after* the shots have landed. You can still generate threat from attacks that are in mid-air, despite feigning death
---
Weren't we supposed to be outraged that this NPC is cleaving players in a 10+ yard radius? Or are we past this and it's just layering and LFG addons now?
---
Sweet video. I remember downloading this from warcraftmovies.com or whatever that site was called. Hated priests with a passion because I burned in lava of Blackrock mountain more times than I can count.
---
In-Laws are not allowed surprise visits.
---
Right off the bat, I do agree it's important to be upfront about what spec you are to your guild. But...
---
&gt; You wont get mana tide totem which is huge for group dynamics and survive-ability.
---
I super disagree. The best case scenario is that you are able to mana tide another group of healers - at which point 1 or 2 shamans are needed to have mana tide. In most cases, though, the shamans are placed with the DPS for windfury, grace of air, or threat reduction totems, all of which any shaman spec can provide.
---
&gt; Your statistics on healing will be consistantly lower, by a large margin, from full resto shamans.
---
Not really. 30/0/21 is usually a chain heal spam build. Very few talents in resto actually affect chain heal.
---
You still got 3 days to get a divorce dw
---
I'll take 2 plz
---
Is there a semi-official source saying I won't get banned? I would love to use it and set up add-ons beforehand, but I'm to worried because of posts like these:
---
&gt;Note: people are being banned because Blizzard is able to detect changes  to the game's files (through notably the Arctium launcher) which allows  for model edits and other things breaking (or toying with) the ToS. *If* this is the case, there really isn't anything that can be done. 
---

They never heard of it because they didn't actually play vanilla.

Aimshot breaks shadowmeld when the cast begins in 1.12, sadly.  However Nelf hunters in mistral towns are gonna be Kings of griefing,  with Fd into Meld

If you don't smoke, don't go out of your way to intentially develop an expensive and unhealthy addiction... WOW is bad enough. :P
---
None of Blizzard's support staff is outsourced. They are all Blizzard employees.
---
My only experience with these mafias is from private servers, and there the people who did this were most certainly selling their excess gold.
---
I would actually regard Kungen as one of those who are actually passionate about the game &amp; old school mmo-rpg's in general and not doing it in part for the money. Mostly the reason for him being away and only now coming back for classic is that he has had a bad time dealing with mental health.
---
Tauren hunter with T3! That was my very first character, and I always wanted that armour.
---
Always check the cabin...
---
Or just re-release the old one.
---
What 99% of everyone’s night elf male will look like. All running around Franklin style with floppy ears.
---
I think people can agree that cosmetics, pets and mounts are all leaning toward the predatory side of MTX. But Server Xfers not only were a part of classic, but they deter gold farmers. Which makes them a great part of the game as a whole. Anyone saying otherwise is fucking kidding themselves.
---
it was xyzabc on whitemane, but i moved to skeram so it doesnt bother me anymore haha
---
I absolutely love hunter. I played a 60 hunter on a Pserver for a few months. I like to think I destroyed in pvp (I care about pvp the most). Hunter is a bit harder imo with the deadzone, etc.. But you have the ability to out play your opponent, and even win 2v1s plenty of time. They are so much fun in world pvp.
---
I also love them for their solo farming capabilities. Solo farm maraudon princess, dire maul tribute run, leveling is a breeze. They do fall off in PvE damage after BWL.. But they are still needed, and generally not hard to find a raid spot in 40 man raids.
---
it's different when there are no timers, scaling difficulty sliders, or cross realm groups, no?

I upgraded to a 27 inch 1440 monitor recently (well, about a year ago), and like every other monitor size upgrade I've made over the years it would be hard to go back from it. Just make sure to spend a little extra to get the best quality monitor you can. It does make a difference, and a good monitor will probably last you for 2-3 PC upgrades.
---
Wailing Caverns is a really incredible dungeon. Massive, and with some really fun flavor thrown in. And some really good loot.
---
Both the 1/29/21 and 7/13/31 are good options. The 1/29/21 has more damage in its feral forms, but the 7/13/31 has more long term sustainability in world pvp with Swiftmend and Nature's Swiftness, while still retaining the speed and utility of the feral forms. Really just comes down to your preference. 
---
Both of them get insect swarm, ns, feral charge, feline swiftness. You are really just deciding between a deeper resto build that would let you be a healer in groups on the side but sacrifices some of the raw damage that lets you perform well in solo. Or a HotW build that lets you tank/dps on the side with some healing viability and better pure damage but sacrifices some of its long term sustainability of heals.
---
We did it you guys, we're totally heroes
---
The sandbox has a different client launcher which has no connection to the Blizzard servers at all.

The owner of Arctium (Fabian) can give confirmation about this.

---
Are you fucking joking?
---
I think I would need to use it to know what part of it to break in order to not really cause any damage. If what you propose would still force you to do something that you really would prefer to not have to do, then I think it would definitely work.
---
Not sure if anyone ever played WC2 custom games, but if you were Khadgar and had a teammate pissing you off you could just polymorph his hero and it was permanent so he'd have no other option but to just quit the game.
---
still no reply? rofl.

Checked out your profile to see if there was any cool table tennis stuff and instead found that this was your first Reddit comment in FIVE YEARS. That's wild. Hope the injury heals up!

My old man is playin the same 3 classes as you! Lols
---
By that logic there are so many aspects of the game we should have removed, since it they were way less used back then.  
---
And no, CtA was not "less powerful" it functioned the exact same way, just different graphical interfaces (ie; only visual differences).
---
do whatever you want, man. it's your experience. i would suggest starting with a clean slate and adding addons that suit your needs and play style.

&gt; raid and push for Rank14
---
Set yourself up for some reasonable expectations first. 
---
Rogues will do more damage overall in pvp and pve but you will constantly have to compete over a ton of gear.
---
Hunters will still go into pretty much every raid for tranq shot and trueshot even though their damage falls of a ton. Hunters are still amazing in pvp.
---
Just find something you like playing and stick with that.
---
Lol mine did that when I first got it but now it never overheats. I think it became enchanted.
---
I was driving from CA to MA headed back from a 6 month internship to start the next college term. Stopped at an old buddy's place in CO. He had to work the day I arrived. Before he left he logged into his wow account and said "hey, try this game out."... still playing 13 years later.

You just download the addon file and unzip it into your addons folder
---
Are you joking?

2. Enter in the three classes
---
3. Press "Pick a random item
---
4. Are you happy with the result? Go with that class. Are you disappointed? Don't go with that class. You already know what you want to play, you just need to be temporarily convinced that you don't have a choice to realize it.
---
Well, yeah, it'll be fine the same way it's fine now.

i’m the last person i would have suspected, but i was looking for me all the time. its the perfect crime.

Yessir!
---
lol the community for Classic is going to cancer compared to actual vanilla judging by this subreddit and discord. Here's hoping most of you quit playing ASAP.
---
I might look up and see if I missed some quests in one of my thoroughly cleared areas, but no big deal if I do a bit more running because I forgot something.

The devilsaur mafia is organic.  No problem with that.  If they form a complex group and plan to lock down a resource then more props to them.  The solution would be to combat that with others that feel oppressed by mafia.  Maybe.

It's good for so many situations. Also consider that a trinket at pre 60 is damn good since it fills the slot.
---
This trinket has a wider range of PvP possibilities than PvE, but it boils down to this item having a use throughout the entirety of Classic vs a staff that will be replaced fairly quickly in the grand scheme of things.

Nice fake lol
---
I wouldn't necessarily say not using addons makes it "extra hard" but just more time consuming. When I was first playing I didn't use addons and there was a lot of time spent wandering around the zones wondering where everything is. But that actually made the exploration value a lot higher. I stumbled across things or other players I might've never seen or experienced like when I started using a Quest Helper addon. The addon makes things a little rote and the world feels less alive.  
---
I guess I'd encourage you to try both ways. You can always disable the addon if you don't like the experience.

I'm sorry but it's just not true. The majority of the playerbase is casual. The majority of the playerbase wanted most of the things that Blizzard did. They tried to appeal to their consumers like almost all businesses do.

Awesome work!

Male Human with Dreadnaught and Thunderfury + Shield!
---
Yes, even today, after what is considered their prime, Blizzard still has a massive effect on the gaming industry. But is there another gaming company, except for Nintendo, that had such a massive impact on the gaming industry? 
---
Warcraft 1 was an amazing RTS for it's time
---
Warcraft 2 was even better
---
Starcraft essentially became a national phenomenon in South Korea and is probably the most important e-sport game of all time.
---
The Diablo series basically invented a new genre
---
Warcraft 3 combined RTS and RPG perfectly and is arguably still the best RTS ever created. It led to the invention of DoTa (Yes it started in Starcraft, but got really going in WC3) and Tower Defense, which can be considered two genres of their own.
---
Do I even have to mention Classic WoW?
---
Dwarf paladin tier 2 would be badass. Or why not the unfortunately impossible gnome druid in tier 2.
---
Regardless really cool work!
---
You are not getting an authentic vanilla experience on a PvE server, I would strongly suggest rolling on a PvP server.
---
Classic+
---
https://github.com/DomenikIrrgang/ClassicLFG/issues/60

I personally thought Shadowcraft looked great.  The dungeon 1 set was Shadowcraft ... right?
---
I'm not even sure if I'm joking here but the reddit-segment of Shazzrah is probably too busy looking at all that strange shit in their discord and miss-representing themselves as Spanish players on other servers.

or in dungeon set gear.
---
You're grasping at straws now my friend
---
Gotcha, that's just completely foreign to me. I also live in the midwest where small talk is super common, so we are all pretty open about it. I would just feel so uncomfortable working in an environment where I felt that I had to keep things like taking time off to play a video game to myself. Like the mental obligation of feeling like you have to be private about something so inane sounds exhausting. You know what I mean? My boss who doesn't play any kind of video game went out of his way to ask me how excited I am for launch. I guess when you have a healthy amd respectful work environment you tend to forget what it's like to not have it.
---
Yes it did.
---
It’s ok to not respond if you don’t know the anwser. Self segregation is still segregation no matter how you label it. 
---
Me asking a question about something isn’t making an issue out of it. Are we not allowed to ask questions on forums?
---
I'd kind of like to see an option to show the new models…  \*ducks\*
---
It's just a different philosophy. Some people would feel that the fancy art my be dishonest because it doesn't reflect the actual game. Other's like the fancy art.
---
All it is is preference.
---
&gt; A straight up PvP server though, what is the good points to it? What attracts people to it
---
There are no artificial restrictions dictating when you can or can't attack your enemies. It feels more "natural" for lack of a better term to me.
---
Slow but smooth wanding 
---
Everyone wants healing

Jokes on you, I can't find a job.
---
First, I’m not going to downvote you. You’re allowed your opinion. 
---
Second, the free transfers were also a thing in vanilla and you’re right they make the game better. 
---
Third, I see your points. There are less nefarious reasons for moving servers though (move to a fresh one with friends perhaps?).
---
I don’t see a problem with moving to ‘reset reputation’. Some people do dumb things and that ruins them on a server. Do they deserve perma-ignore by half the server now? Probably not forever buuut who actually removes people from the ignore list. A paid transfer is like a monetary fine and a chance to try again. Sure they may troll again on the new server, but soon they’ll be ignored again and get to choose between paying the fine or living with it.
---
I'd bet anything that if the icons were swapped, people would still be saying the same exact thing. People just developed a positive association with the vanilla icons.
---
Was 16 when I first played in '06, I'm 30 now.

that’s right brothers! Let’s keep telling ourselves that!

Amazing stuff thanks so much... would really appreciate warrior or mage macros if you have them!
---
In retail literally one of the fastest ways to level is killing 10+ murlocs at a time in Elwynn. With full heirlooms and enchants you can pull and kill multiple mobs consistently throughout your leveling experience. 
---
I don’t know why you’re trying to bullshit about this?
---
I want more of these from the guide. I used to have this guide and it's been lost for ages now.

Well now that I want to suffer through that lol
---
yes but thats because blizzard offers no in-game group rating system..
---
they do however offer you easy ways to communicate in game via whispers  party chat / guild chat / trade / general chat. So forming groups manually is not that big of a task, it simply takes some patience and willing to talk to people. So most people, especially those concerned with the authentic classic WoW experience will just use the in game tool instead of an external website or app.
---
Providing an addon interrupts this system quite a lot and results in inconsistent communication and group forming methods throughout the community which ultimately breaks it apart slowly but surely.

Tell them both to run to the STV arena, and whoever lives through their duel you go that faction.

But they will always respawn, and thus providing moneymaking opportunity for other players.
---
It's not like mining out a coal mine or something IRL, where the resource is finite and WILL run out. Think of it kinda like solar power. You can't get an infinite amount of energy in one go, but it will always be available over time, and thus be available for everyone.
---
BAWLS and sandwhiches. And water. Maybe some lays baked chips. Bagels. Cream cheese. Picked up a george foreman grill 2 weeks ago. Grilled chez ftw.
---
Get over trying to change classic, the sooner Blizzard disables addons being able to communicate with each other the better. You wanna get a group? Better make a macro to spam LFG chat buddy.
---
That first restart with a SSD is sweet! Instead of being a chore to leave discord buddies and be al9ne for 5-10 minutes on my previous 6-7 year old machine its 30 seconds now. Its bonkers ha. Enjoy!
---
So do you think it's okay then to subjugate a new server to ninja looter who has the money to just go from server -&gt; server ripping guilds off?
---
There's many more reasons along these lines as well, disallowing server transfers would stop gold farmers as well, as they wouldn't be able to farm a multitude of servers at once and then transfer all their wealth to one central server.
---
lol stfu
---
There were, but cata bosses often had multiple in the same fight with pretty high execution requirements. Sure TBC bosses had them but TBC bosses also often had a single mechanic. Cata bosses had 3-4 or more a lot of the time and at release any one of those was often instant death if you got hit by it.
---
It felt very "unfair" to my recollection having raided for the majority of TBC.
---
Nothing like cooling off with a refreshing drink of Palmolive after a tough night of raiding...
---
Automated to a degree. The power of the WoW addon api is pretty cool, and can really make some QoL improvements without affecting core gameplay balance. Though, things like healbots and stuff like that can be an issue.

This looks shopped. I can tell because of the pixels and from seeing a few shops in my time.

I'm having fun, bored at work lol
---
Because of a tiny, tiny percentage of the population - streamers and top guilds - now most players think the only way to correctly play Classic is to hyper-analyze every step you take to minimize time until 60.
---
Classic isn't like retail - there's no expansions waiting for you after level cap.  Speeding through leveling is literally ignoring most of the game.

if you find reading mediocre stories interesting, play without it

there are plenty of warcraft books to go through

This feature is available in 4.0.10.  The current stable version is 4.0.9 (available on curse, etc).  you will need to download the master branch on github to get this feature.  They are planning to do an official update once they can test the update on the classic client.  Along with some other features.
---
I can tell you i regret using one when i started playing in early to mid Wrath.
---
I also wont be using one on Classic (at least for my first toon).  My memory is crap, so its not like im going to remember much anyways lol.
---
Ill miss some quests, but oh well.  The one thing i'd like to find is an addon that would show where quests are on the minimap, but only if im within 10 yards or so of them.  Just just nervous about not checking in some random room of a house, or something.

Start your day with some Yogurt.  Grab a Sandwich, or Salad if you want to be healthy for Lunch.  Then for Dinner actually log off, and sit down and eat a hearty meal.  The reason I recommend Dinner be hearty is because you know damn well you will be staying up until 3-4am.
---
If you're looking for a build that your guildie mentioned, why don't you ask your guildie? 
---
Anyway, your build is going to depend a lot on your play style. Personally I wouldn't recommend an Arms/Prot heavy hybrid for most people because best case scenario you're just "decent" at both damage dealing and survivability. It will be slow for leveling, and not optimal for most max level content outside of the easier dungeons and raids. I'd probably call this sort of build "the dedicated offtank", and if it sounds like you, [I'd recommend something like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/353053213020100021--550500203).
---
Omg, this is gold
---
ROFL, no clue.

and a mouse for each hand.

I think it could have been some number between 100% and killing 100 Zhevras lol.  But that's not the timeline we're in.

Ah yeah debuff ofc..

Oomhammer for my shaman.

Yea, so does oRA and DBM.

Lol, what a great crash-and-burn ending.

Pretty much same. Going to be a long weekend of waiting.

If he can't get his old guild back together he will be the next one to join the Method group.
---
Explain it like this, everyone above the age of 35 says "man I wish I could go back to when i was 18 again, I would not waste so much time watching TV and goofing off, I would do some fun shit every day, and I would score alot more chicks/dudes and party like crazy". You can do that in classic wow now, without having to lose weight and get buff.
---
Dream walker Druid with Atiesh!
---
The fuck are you calling me sweety for? Please don't use pet names with me, that's condescending and fucking weird.
---
That's why I do it! My first toon was a warrior, I remember how annoying weapon skills are. I just pass along the love now that I'm a mage main :)
---
If someone wants to pay $20 to change their War Stomp for 25% stun resist, fine with me. Racial balance changes will happen, and that seems like an expensive adventure to me. I won't ever do it, i'll just make another character.
---
I get what you are saying about having your choices matter, but punishing players by not allowing changes doesn't seem right to me. If they choose to pay, that is their choice.
---
There are less effort memes that stay. You on the mods side there too? It is WoW related btw. As you can see the whole Meme is about the Classic WoW Subreddit.
---
"That you aren't funny" 135 positive votes says at least some people think it is funny. Trying to turn your subjectivity into objective rating?

They aren't bad in classic, it's just not going to stand out as much as the other classes who top meters.
---
Still have incredible utility, still able to kill any class 1v1 in pvp, and have a huge advantage over quite a few, and druids have a massive skill ceiling. The challenge is fun.
---
I don't really think the ambiguity of quests is really what makes classic have that classic "feel". But really, you do what you think will give you the most authentic experience. People still had quest guides back in the day, and it can be really frustrating to have to run back and forth in an area with no mount repeatedly because you weren't aware of the quest structure. I honestly see both sides of this coin as being pretty valid.
---
Oom
---
Hurry. Ban discord users for using external software since it enhances one's ability to coordinate.

Well yeah you're right on it won't be as fast. But I think a lot of people are not giving Blizz enough credit. If you played the stress tests, they definitely weren't all doom and gloom like people are saying.

I had to roll against 2 paladins to get my eye of sulfuras...
---
Yeah I don't think so either since most people that will play don't even read reddit. I just didn't really read the tones as mad and can understand why people don't want it to get big. It brings modern WoW into classic.
---
He pulled it out his ass
---
I would highly recommend you play without a quest add on. I do not think you should look at it like it's the "hard" route. The magic described comes from looking around and experiencing the world.
---
If you have trouble solving a quest you can Google it for help or answers. But if you use the addons you will have all of the answers before you even know if you need the help. You may not miss any side quests but will they even be sidequests if you went straight for them and have planned your route around them? 
---
Don't use the addons. Spend more time looking around. Don't think of it as hard mode because you didn't find the arathi pirate quests. Think of the magic of stumbling upon a hub you didn't know was there.

Wooosh

They’ll be back up shortly.

oh, snookums

If there are so many people using the addon that it interferes with a small few then that is acceptable more than the minority dictating things.
---
If people dont want to use it then dont. If there truly are enough people not wanting to use it to warrant such an outcry then it shouldnt be a problem for the few who choose to use it.
---
Just gank him?
---
Not sure if I 100% believe that, but if it was, they probably definitely have that patched up, haha.
---
I think there is a difference in using thottbot or wowhead to look up quests you can't figure out and having every quest 'solved' without you even having to look at the quest text.
---
Additionally, Questie also shows you were you can get every quest on the (mini-)map which kind of ruins exploring the world for yourself.

Not the same thing. Nice try, though.

I expect the economy to be thoroughly screwed over in pretty short order. Not because of layering but because that's what players do. Prices are determined by the "wealthy" and what they're willing to pay. If someone can get 50g for a level 10 item then they'll try - to hell with the actual level 10 that might want it but couldn't possibly afford it.

lass choice: I'm looking for advice on which class to choose. I want to DPS for group content. I'd like a class that can fare well in world PvP as well, what are the options for something that isn't too bad at both? Which race should I pair with which class, does it matter?
---
Mage/rogue. Mage will be better for leveling and finding groups.
---
Realm choice: What goes into choosing a realm? Any suggestions, or things to avoid?
---
PvE for a more easy going atmosphere and PvP if you want to be under constant threat of getting killed in the world. World pvp is an amazing experience as long as your not just getting camped and ganked as your only experience.
---
Profession choice: Is an end game crafter necessary? Can you buy things that other people have crafted for you or are the best craftable items account bound? Which gathering professions have the potential to earn the most gold/phour?
---
I’d say herbalism has the greatest hour. Black lotus are going to be nuts.

Is there a wow classic wiki? How is it? Just stick to wowhead.
---
Any general recommendations in terms of goals for the first weeks of play? I will be taking time to simply enjoy what's going on and let the game speak to me, however I am very goal oriented so if you could make suggestions on what to strive for I would appreciate it.
---
Enjoy the ride, don’t burn yourself out.
---
Does the game become a new game at max level? Is it a different experience or what I get while leveling will sort of be the same as what you get.
---
Some say that the journey to 60 is the game but trust me. The real game begins at 60.
---
The journey trough quest gear to dungeon gear to raid gear. That’s the progression journey that makes wow classic amazing.

Awesome setup! My computer just fucking died on me yesterday 😂 Worst timing.

Of course carrying will be a thing. Running people through dungeons has been a thing since vanilla. Why would it change?
---
IIRC, 2 piece Tier 5 sets for hunters and warlocks healed their pets based on the damage the hunter or warlock did.  Good enough that people were still using them right up until Blizzard removed set bonuses from older tiers.
---
i downloaded it :)
---
Just kill these fuckers on sight. Blacklist them and their guild, and kill as many of them as often as you can. Report them for botting too if you can, in case they are botting. Judging by Eve Online's community, they will be. There is no place here for people like this. Break them apart, and never buy gold or boosts.
---
Nice, I like this one the best
---
I see, yeah I played a lot of ESO and have that looming in the back of my mind. But how does having two sets of 2 different weapons work when it comes to the skill tree? Do you put a bit of points in both prot for 1h/shield and arms for the 2h?
---
Not it's not necessary.  But people want to feel like their frustrations with the current game are validated so they diss BfA as utter trash.
---
Bird up!
---
Different people like different things.
---
I have never played wow in my life. is it worth to give classic a try? I'm just worried I will fall behind all the pro players out there who obviously know way much than me about the game.
---
Harm already conditions nodead and exists. Spaces are only used for easy readability. You dont need them for the macro to work
---
What server are you on? Seems like the east coast server queue times may make it really difficult to hit that goal.
---
I want a cat mount so I will be joining you in NE land! Gotta grind that rep
---
Where the hell do the orcs get all these giant bones/tusks from that they use in ALL of their buildings?
---
Doesn't matter if they break it in time. I'd suggest banning everyone that uses it to remove their stupid lazy toxic mentality, but that unfortunately is never going to happen.
---
pls no
---
Thank you for you're honestly.
---
Damn, how many ms does that get ya?
---
Which I believe many will do.  Many will also prefer to play sooner than later and whichever queue is shortest will become their new server.
---
We have a large group so we will be staying put most likely.
---
You can sandbox the current classic client with arctium and start a local server (without mobs and npcs). Please take this advice with a grain of salt, since blizzards warden scans for this. You should be fine tho since blizzard knows that’s people use it to setup addons the days before classic. You might want to “clean up” after you’re done and delete and reinstall classic  since arctium will modify game assets which is against the tos and banable.
---
Could work in early phases, prob not later. 
---
But still appreciate it :)
---
It was 1280x720 coz had a shit pc. But it was fulll screen 16:9
---
What? It is common to not want to take someone who will roll on your gear or do low damage.
---
I highly suggest looking into using Chrome Remote Desktop instead. You can download the app on your phone and connect to the computer effortlessly as long as you use the same google account to set it up on your computer as you use on your phone. The setup is extremely easy. Just have Chrome on your computer and search "Chrome Remote Desktop" to get the browser extension. I've used it for about 3 years now to do stuff on my home computer while I'm at work. You can also access it from chrome on any computer if you sign in with that account.
---
I accept
---
All Pally, All Druid raid groups.
---
All Fury Warrior 40 man Raid, you kill the boss before boss wipes you.
---
I need one of these for lock!
---
Damn I thought that section was just for hunters
---
What’s amazing is these people ruined retail wow just to leave and ruin it again.
---
AFK rune dragons are much more gp/h
---
Gee /u/geogeology that's a nasty cough you are developing there and your forehead sure is hot to the touch. I recommend a week of isolation with lots of grinding er i mean resting.
---
Beer, pizza, yoghurt, water, pre workout and not redbull, salats, sandwiches, fish, eggs, a professional cook, my gf making me food, my mom making me food, my dad making me food, fasting, avocado, brocolli. I dont have time to cook if I get on the server. If I am stuck waiting then I am gonna make a feast and starve until someone wakes up or comes home from work to make me food.
---
after watching this I realized I want three kids, the perfect 5 man group.
---
No, but I do need hit rating
---
That is not possible.
---
Knowing the pserver community, probably a swastika.
---
Nobody ever said that the tank should be spamming sunders out of the gate. The 3 sunder guideline is assuming that they're following their normal priorities.
---
Paid Server transfers are fine tho
---
I like this as well, good job avocdad
---
helping people find groups to fun dungeons is different than teleporting them to the dungeon.
---
So lets say a boss drops  4 items. 2  plate, a mail and a trinket. The addon will roll the plates and trinkets for plate users only, mail will get mail and trinket, everyone else just the trinket. This might seem like personal loot but its accualy a roll with restrictions.
---
Okay I’ll probably get downvoted for asking, but when is official launch?
---
Going to sleep will help pass the time quicker. Why the F is he up at 3am?
---
my opinion is based on the same people just changing their mind just before classic start
---
&gt; but they're just so lackluster and bad in classic
---
How are they lackluster and bad?
---
Lol you ask for more then say you won't read it. Too easy.
---
Eve Autism vs. Private Server Autism. The final showdown.
---
Hate to burst your bubble but on a Classic server with a healthy population there is no way you're going to get the same amount of gold. I didn't see a single other player in your video - in reality you will not only have competition but you will also have people trying to gank the s#@% out of you if you're sub-60.
---
The problem is this add on negatively effects people that don't use it.
---
I am fine if you want to load up 10 million add ons, but the moment you start negatively effecting players who choose to use few or no add ons, then the add on needs to be looked at and perhaps banned.

You haven't even killed the end boss in Uldir on normal...

yeah.."easy" Lmao kids like you are a joke.

Heh, I remember raiding with him in Cata.
---
Personally i wont be using it but I couldn't give two flying fucks if other people do.  People are going to play bow they want  if it isnt this its goi n to ne a website or a discord,  being slightly less convenient.
---
Well, I mean you call a spade as spade, right?
---
BFA *is* trash.
---
The audacity! This game needs to come out for a number of reasons and one of those reasons is so I can leave this hellhole of a sub
---
dude i was literally half way though reading that when you removed it
---
https://github.com/DomenikIrrgang/ClassicLFG/issues/60?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Thanks I'll check it out. No port forwardig required? That's always hit or miss if I can do it.
---
No, it was never intended to be a lootable item.  If anything it was the precursor to the Thunderfury bindings.  Besides it was not available in 1.12, so there is no reason other than meme-status for it to be available in classic.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Bear tanks are flat out better before 60. They do more dps and more threat than a warrior at all levels of play. The warriors biggest advantage is being crit immune but that won’t happen until max level or close to it anyway. In the meantime, the bear will have substantially more hp and armor. The gap is even larger at lower levels when warrior doesn’t have access to a ton of amazing mail armor yet there are sets like the defias armor a Druid can use. Even 19 twinks use the very leather armor a Druid would tank in. Druids are also better at magical fights since spells don’t care about shield blocks or parries etc but having a bigger hp pool does help.
---
This is the proof that show that wow community is nothing except trashy and entitled children who cry about a simple ADD ON. Seriously classic isn't made for you you neck beards.
---
I never used it, I don't remember even hearing about addons until at least a year into release.
---
Orctioneer for my bank alt and Moneyshots for my hunter twink
---
Well, the very creation of classic is proof of how bad BFA is.    
---
Think about it, they've been developing game for 14 years and eventually players want the version that is 14 years old.
---
Is that a bow?
---
Jesus.
---
For me it wasn't even my parents. My public school had a very strict attendance policy. The only way to get out of school was to have a doctor's note. Thankfully I too am an adult now but just wondering how kids are doing it especially since school just recently started. I guess many just don't care and skip?
---
I was so sad when blizzard took down the fan art and fan comics archive...wish it was still out there somewhere
---
i wish i still had my warcraft shirt
---
Working with what I have here! Some of the races' voice lines are better for certain abilities. Night Elf are particularly good.
---
Hm good to know!
---
Yeah we all said that during legion
---
pot calling the kettle black here
---
Maybe your mom can do it for you?
---
Yeah, just in general I don't like the excuse, like trying to make a run worse just so you can try to throw off blame makes you a worse tank.
---
Wow is a lot more to a lot of people.
---
I've been doing this for almost 15 years now. Always a quick Power Word: Fortitude, top to full and a cleanse if there's a stupid half hour debuff and go on my way.
---
Sometimes I get a quick PM saying "Thanks!", usually not and it's okay too.
---
Sounds like a hassle, I don't want to play with other people...
---
This is my server.
---
Fuck the coalition! Down with the coalition!

---
Of course enough wont spawn for everyone to get exactly what they need, there needs to be some scarcity to drive up demand. But as resources are essentially infinite (as they always respawn), everyone can actually get what they need/want.
---
It doesn’t take anyone out if LFG, however I would venture that it makes it less relevant than it was.
---
Having dungeon finding on the same ground floor for players is pretty important.
---
Yep, you gonna flip a table in disgust?
---
I understand very well the reasons : a bunch of players who never played vanilla try to ride the bandwagon spouting nonsense to defend some sort of holly "vanilla" spirit that doesn't really exist. 
---
There is nothing made easier or harder about the game with this addon : it only makes easier to see which group are seeking members without reading 100s of chat lines in the lfg channel.
---
Frostbolt and drinking mostly. Sometimes you may wand if they have only a hit or two of hp left.
---
I think the reason for p servers in vanilla was because some people couldn't afford to pay sub back then, perhaps you don't know, but not everyone is from the north america/western europe.    
---
I do think it is, to some extent. There is a huge demand for wow classic, if current state of wow wasn't bad - there wouldn't be
---
Fucking chad
---
And legion was arguably the best modern expansion by far.
---
fuck this guy
---
So far the classic community is far more toxic than anything I’ve ever experienced in WoW and the game isn’t even released yet.
---
Nice.
---
That's exactly what this add-on does you absolute spackers.

That's sorta up to you. [The talent trees only have a few talents that directly affect weapon types/shields.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#L)
---
You keep arguing about something that happened in wotlk which has zero references to vanilla wow. Are you missing the fucking point? Look at everyone elses answer. It will happen and no you will not encounter whatever you cry about - if you do then leave the fucking group you weeb.
---
I freaking hate that people are trying to go out of their way to ruin how other people might play the game. You're all trump supporters.

and the you realized  it doesn't do half the crap people here are saying and its not that bad of a chat filter
---
I don't disagree with that statement
---
In the captain's quarter's.
---
There is also general chat for the area of the dungeon you want to run. And maybe also just asking in the hub area, like Crossroads for Wailing Caverns.
---
what the fuck
---
as a rogue, I totally agree. Ppl should do that!
---
I guess it depends, do race swaps include faction swaps? 
---
Im sure there are some examples, but the biggest examples come from alliance vs horde.
---
Nah bro, my Vanilla experience was killing Gamon every time I hearthed to Org, particularly after dinging. He’s gonna die or I’ll die trying.
---
I like BFA but the decision to not make Azerite Essences account-wide was so terrible and malicious that it ruined the entire xpac for me.  I spent season 2 having a great time pushing 5 toons above 1300 raider.io score just to find out I will now have to spend months on timegated crap dailies, azerite farming, and hundreds of hours doing PVP  to make my alts competitive (Lucid Dreams, BotE, Crucible of Flame, etc) 
---
Great potential ruined by misguided attempts to make people subscribe longer
---
Honestly, I simply expect you to party with me, and follow me around while providing the exact totems I need for all situations. We will make it work.
---
Server transfer is not a game mechanic. It doesnt affect your performance. Only changes the people around you
---
great for when you are oom.
---
I liked some things about BFA.
---
I liked how my spec played.
---
I thought the dungeons were okay.
---
I thought the leveling was fun, if brief.
---
Mechanically though, the end game was a complete shitshow.
---
Help me decide where/what to play pls :) 
---
Hi all, So I am a little conflicted on where to play, and what faction to play. I was originally planning on rolling on faerlina, as an Orc/UD rogue, however I got my name stolen from me on that server, and the fact that its full is making me second guess rolling there. Also I've been paying attention to each servers subreddit and faerlinas is just filled with pure streamer memes, while grobb seems to have an already thriving community with invested players. I also have the username I wanted on grobbulus, and since its RPPVP, I kinda got sweet on the idea of rolling ally instead, since I've always wanted to play Night elf. I've also never played alliance, so itd be a fresh experience for me. The only drawback I see from rolling ally, is I've always been a hardcore PVPer, and love ganking alliance citys, also horde in my experience are more willing to help out and start a war with alliance than alliance is likewise. Anyways. Im conflicted. Help me figure out where to go pls :(
---
PS: Alliance rogues, how fun is ganking horde vs ganking alliance? Is stealthing through UC/ORG as fun as sneaking around IF and SW? Help!
---
is that an actual statistic? or just an assumption. Idk anyone who cares about the lfg addon.
---
There’s not “No-difference,” otherwise, why use the addon? Why make the addon? Besides that, there is clearly a difference between a UI providing you a list with information and having to sift through whispers yourself. It makes the process easier, less cumbersome, more streamlined, less painful. 
---
You are definitely splitting players depending on how many people use the addon. If the addon gains enough users, it would be much more streamlined to essentially only use the addon for the players who have it.
---
I played vanilla and never heard of it.
---
subscription killed WOW
---
nerfing Preparation killed WOW
---
talent changes killed WOW
---
x-realm bg's killed WOW
---
content patches killed WOW
---
expansions killed WOW
---
....  
---
some time later Blizzard announces WOW is being discontinued  
---
reaction of playerbase:  
---
"What? it was perfectly alive! How could you?"  
---
pls shove all the "killed WOW" up in the mouthes of ppl that even dare to pronounce it, or would they like to play patch 1.10 for 15years?
---
Stolen.   
---
I don't even feel guilty :P Good work.
---
I don't even have to argue here. Just read the answers of this thread, and I leave you to draw your own conclusions about this "insignificant design decision".
---
The alternative is that we all laugh ourselves raw at your edgy lame attempt at cutting down an opposing view to all the flaming being done. Quick glance at your post history shows you're not exactly a beacon of wit and measured thoughtful responses. Your post fits your bill I suppose.
---
Pretty pathetic, man.
---
I need those maps, Give me those maps!!!
---
It has been explained ad naseum why mtx cosmetics are bad.
---
The achievements you make in game NEED TO MEAN SOMETHING, and if Billy Deeppocket has his way, he'll get the leetest looking mounts, cutests pets etc by whipping out his payment card--it's bad game design.
---
Even transmog which isn't even PAID is an example of cosmetics which detract from the experience.
---
It's best to be extremely cautious about what they add

I can't wait until 2035 so we can all play Classic Classic WoW in our wheelchairs.

What's dead may never die

I'm leveling a Human pally with my roommate who is going Gnome warlock. We both work Monday-Friday next week, and I'm stuck on a late day Monday so I'll miss the 6p ET launch, but missing that rush queue doesn't really bother me. Through the week we'll just be playing a few hours a night between work and a roughly normal sleep schedule. We both have next Friday and Labor day off work, so that 4 day weekend will be when we hit it super hard.
---
Meal prepping with a hearty beef roast in the slow cooker this weekend, and for the big weekend I've got a pork shoulder set aside to make pulled pork for sandwiches and meals. I'm also grabbing us some fresh veggies and fruits to snack on, I'll probably make like 5 pounds of boiled peanuts rather than buying a bunch of chips or other salty snacks. And my roommate had to get us some good unhealthy snacks for when we want to be total lazy pieces of shit, so we have frozen pizza and corn dogs and pizza rolls.
---
To keep from dying of an embolism or fusing with our chairs, we'll be taking breaks throughout that weekend to smoke some fadeleaf and play with my roommates dog out in the yard.
---
We're not looking to power level, in fact I expect we'll be in the latter half of the pack all the way to 60. We've gotten pretty heavy into Pathfinder and D&amp;D in recent years, and we both want to approach this with more of an exploratory and slow mindset instead of racing to max like we did when we first signed up in Vanilla. Leveling professions as we go, stopping to relax and fish, dropping a hammer and dots on the random Horde that wants to try and draxx them sklounst. It's gonna be great!
---
But there's no community I'm on the biggest server and no one knows anyone and all guys have 500 people yet no one talks....weird
---
I would consider throwing $7 in the trash bin for no reason pretty significant yes.
---
Pretty accurate, alliance is a bunch of pussies and the horde are dicks.
---
NO server transfers! They ruin the community.
---
Yup, sleep debt is a real thing, and even one all nighter can really mess with your body.
---
I think most of, if not all of us dislike some, if not most things about Retail.
---
Theres just a big difference between having a conversation about it and how a fair amount of this sub is about it (the toxicity OP is talking about).
---
I 100% agree theres a lot wrong with Retail, and thats a lot of why ive been looking forward to Classic.  I just get sick of the low effort/downright toxic way its often brought up on this sub.
---
19 twink with bis staff ;)
---
Do you play with your feet? /s

---
Oh you’re the guy saying the things. You’re pretty wrong in those posts, I’m afraid.
---
I just started playing WoW again recently, I only played for the first year it came out and when I got back on everything felt so cartoonish. I still love playing it though, and the whole game is basically new content which I love.
---
Until lv 70 I believe
---
&gt;I really don't remember an uproar when we finally got LFG in game
---
At that time though no one saw what it lead to or how it destroyed the game. Now we know and it does go against the spirit of classic.
---
Meanwhile, us college students on quarter systems don't go back until late September! hahaahaha! (i've always hated quarters until *exactly* this moment)
---
How does it look on modern monitors/resolutions?  Last time I tried it was either in a tiny windowed box or stretched to all hell.
---
sure don't
---
Hey there, my friends and I are starting a guild on the server but we haven't done ANY recruiting or handshaking yet. We are waiting to do that in game for the authentic experience, but we also volunteer our forces to defeat this coalition.
---
&gt;Who is here to win?
---
A wipe is a loss.  Anything else is a win.
---
Having a big meter dick doesn't mean jack shit when the Tank and Healer have to work extra hard because of your bullshit.
---
This is a team game.

Holy actual fuck.

Bad dragon back at it again with the not-a-joke themed toys.

Then expect queues, no one's forcing you to move but if you don't you deal with the consequences.

I rolled on Bloodsail! I like a smaller population, and don’t mind not having to deal with crowded questing locations the first few days!

There is no possible way to make good use of time after bubble hearthing no sir.

---
I mean, there is nothing bad stating that you don't like X about current state of WoW, however if someone is just spending their time insulting BFA players - yeah, that's retarded, but I don't really see that on this subreddit.  
---
Also, look at /r/wow, there are plenty of people posting similar "negative" posts/opinions about classic.
---
All you are doing with this is getting some random cs rep in trouble for falling out of line. You big dumbdumbs.
---
YEUP
---
Paid server xfer with a long cooldown should always be a thing for two reasons:  
---
* Chance to play with friends on a different server
---
* In the rare case it's a douchebag relocating, it's a zero sum game and that's a win for the server they're deserting
---
I don't care about non-combat pets at all.  The rest, agreed.
---
I’ll bite. Blizzard is still a corporation in the business to make money above all else. The only reason they caved and decided to even make Classic is because their accountants realized it would help bring in more revenue. Absolutely everything else is in service of that. I just wish people would think about this before lavishing praise over companies like this.
---
not that guy but ive asked tons of people to make one and no one wants to. i dont see the issue with this. if you dont like it make your own server
---
I'm soooo glad that that was this week for me at work. Still busy next week, but nowhere close to this week. You have my biggest F.
---
Sure, there are definitely changes needed, I am just saying the philosophy for those changes has to account for a different mountain of content and contemporary expectations. Clearly right now is not peak retail and the stuff you mentioned should be addressed.
---
How about allow free transfers TO dead servers?
---
Wonder why they didn't make hogger the name of a server.  Everyone knows hogger.

You are aware that german population in bfa is 260k while english is 480k right? Why shouldnt they have their own Servers?

It's kind of on the guilds themselves to police for ninja looters. Just like irl there will always be criminals, always be thieves. However, we can do things to try to mitigate them. If someone ninja loots something in your guild then you're likely in a terrible guild and should leave it immediately. Either the leadership is corrupt or careless.

I played vanilla and most people just used in-game chat to find groups.

Figures of speech trigger you. Im willing to bet you think "believe you me" is incorrect to say.

---
Nah it’s pretty bad. I will say this though. It doesn’t work that well as a replacement to the BFA LFG so people might not even really use it. 
---
I fully expect the demographic of player that find this addon useful, to not even make it to 60.
---
Streamers will pass the queue. It’s been confirmed many times.
---
My favorite part is they mention fury warrior but not arms. Like uhh ok last time I heard arms was the default pve spec for damage due to one handers being weak until the item rebalancing.
---
Plucked a nerve I see.
---
Well, thats the way it was in vanilla, and yeah, it is OP, so roll orc if you can and want to pvp.

Going into ZG was amazing... it was like going to disneyland or something.

Classic was 99% about the community and social aspect of playing. find players that have the same view as you do and add them to your friends list. Meet new people, make new friends.
---
now that's a shill xd
---
I just dont remember this scene that good.  I am surprised.
---
since we're here. matrix 4 hype anyone?!?!?!

Dammit. Genuinely meant fat, not gay. Taking this L
---
Do people get off defending bad things?
---
that doesnt block there insessent chat spam about chuck norris and thunderfurry.
---
make no mistakes this has nothing to do with the addon they are worried no one will be looking at the crap they say in /2 anymore
---
Of course. And spirit too... But int the grant scheme of things
---
LET ME OUT!!!
---
Seriously what the fuck is wrong with these people? Why would you ruin something as celebrated as classic wow with something like this? I honestly hope blizzard simply bans these guilds.
---
&gt;Natur Enemy Cast Bar
---
Ah, just like call to arms?
---
You can still get that Classic feel while playing retail. 
---
Just don't use any of the QoL features and stick to your roots.
---
What a beautiful relic.
---
aye.
---
Moar dots moar dots
---
thanks!
---
Retail WoW will survive, there is enough ~~fans~~ WHALES that like it.
---
New Horde: :|
---
Old Horde: &gt;:(
---
Any time someone mentioned something like “it is no longer the wow I remember “, I always say that they should view every expansion as a different game with the same roots.
---
I view it like Mario. Vanilla is SMB1, while retail is Mario Odyssey. After many different iterations (expansions), it has become something very different that the original. They have to be looked at on their own merits and demerits.
---
such a exaggeration but I laughed
---
They might go with a non-technical solution. Blizzard could lean on curse and the other major addon hosting sites to have it removed. Sure people could pass it around, but an addon like that only really works when everyone uses it.
---
Spam curse of weakness on every mob you aggro, even with 4 mob on you you can manage to get away with that.
---
Merges can still happen
---
Unlike humans, forsaken, elves, orcs, trolls, and tauren which have a base movement speed of 30', dwarves and gnomes have a base movement of 20'. However, dwarf movement is unaffected by encumberance.
---
Wait, wrong game...
---
I couldn't agree more. No more "islands" with every expansion that kill off the entire world (of Warcraft) except for the relatively small new expansion area, which in turn is itself killed off when a newer expansion comes out. I'd love if they just kept adding content to existing world (of Warcraft), keeping people spread out over the whole world (of Warcraft) indefinitely.
---
So why do you care about some people hating on BFA in this sub?    
---
Personally, I don't really care - I played a bit of BFA year ago, felt like casual-facebook game and that was it for me, I don't waste time bashing people that play retail.
---
Vanilla WoW *had* a third party LFG addon. CTA even had autoinvite (at least the copy I pulled from 10/8/06 sure makes a call to InviteByName). This isn't some hypothetical corruption of Vanilla; it was functionality that people had access to and used. The mod interacted with the chat channel so people without it had all the same access, and were none the wiser that the chat postings were anything other than hand-pasted artisanal spam. This new mod does the same.
---
And (again, *just like in 1.11*) once you're party's together you still be only with your others on your realm. You'll still need to coordinate meeting and travel (or spend the independent travel time BSing on /p) and you'll still have a reason to remember these names and build opinions of them for next time they're looking for a group. These addons don't remove any of the social aspects of grouping. They just automate the braindead stuff like copy-pasting and deciphering acronyms in chat.
---
Wrapping the LFG channel in a dialog box isn't want killed social cohesion in dungeons. Putting everyone on a multi-server, insta-teleporting carousel of names you'll never see again did.
---
You need a hug pal.
---
Ps no ice in my coke
---
No PvP server will have a larger Alliance faction. It just doesn't happen. As the other poster said, Herod was 44:56 (A:H) on the last poll and is currently 45:55 on this poll. On the Discord, it's 46:54.
---
TLDR? That's about as good as it's gonna get and you're only looking at 10% difference. It's currently equal in balance to Stalagg, both of which are better than Thalnos, Bigglesworth, Fairbanks, and Whitemane.
---
Herod will be fine bro. Let's meet up and have a 1v1. ;)
---
This guy built Stormwind ? Wish I could shake his hand..the city is great and I’ve spent so much time in it
---
I will play on a 800x480 window because my 1920x1080 resolution didnt exist in vanilla so it shouldnt exist in classic either.
---
Big resolution literally gives you a huge advantage over other players who dont use it.
---
if the servers work flawlessly i'd be disappointed
---
Whoever donated the video to sodapoppin, thank you! Lol
---
You have come to the right place.
---
Thank you so much.
---
Dude, everything any company does is to make money. Just because something is making blizzard money doesn't also make it the only reason they're doing it, and doesn't mean they aren't passionate about what they're making. If that was the case, they wouldn't have made it part of the normal wow subscription. Or they would have raised the cost of the general wow subscription to account for access to both game types.
---
I see what you did there lol
---
Is it just me or is Stalagg getting really full?
---
You wanna be top dps?  This is how you fail at that.
---
BIG DICK DAMAGE FROM PULL TO KILL!
---
Can confirm, used to make money sitting outside of WC and running newbies through WC for gold in between bg's.
---
I've watched KOTH so much while playing WoW that I have a pavlovian response to think of Stratholme when I hear the theme song. Same with that Drawn Together show, Chapelle's Show, and South Park.
---
I plan on playing through The Evil Within this weekend. Never played it before. I've already done my preparations for classic, and after watching a friend play a bit of the second one it looks like a really dope game.
---
Also going to do some skateboarding -- it's finally not a billion degrees where I live, so going to try and get out and do some of that :)
---
I logged in and got sad. I want all versions of WoW to do well :( BFA was the first expac I just couldn’t stick around
---
"The only thing that can kill WoW is WoW" was a saying for the longest time amidst all the supposed 'wow killers' being released. Guess we were right all along.
---
Don't be, it's settling down. Currently 45:55. Last poll was 44:56 and the Discord has a balance of 46:54.
---
I don't think you can expect much better on any server.
---
What's an APES?
---
Name yourself MCVax and give their immune system a head start on those diminishing returns.
---
600k
---
Almost everyone probably.
---
Sadly me
---
I got two level 60s in vanilla and very rarely usedn addons even when raiding. The standard Ui was horrible but I still used it. After all my role was only to innervate the priests (the real healers), BR someone every 30 minutes and spam healing touch twice before running oom.
---
But you are right there was like a million addons. There was even one which told you where to go for quest objectives.
---
I don't typically enjoy being wrong but this certainly makes the list.  Thank you both.
---
You can level enchanting to 50 from only disenchanting.  After that it will stop leveling up from disenchants.
---
If you are planning on leveling enchanting to 300 I would recommend saving all your mats until after you have hit 50/300 from disenchants.
---
Ya dingus
---
Lmao at the butthurt retail players in here.  Cope harder
---
I'm pretty sure they removed both restrictions (level and realm).
---
It's only the DH that's restricted now.
---
Should be fine in the low/mid settings.
---
Look it up then? Wtf
---
I'm just going to use Discord honestly. As are many people.
---
It’s gathering at level 1 and production at 5. Tested on stress tests personally. One more difference between pservers and classic is you can’t skin beasts in the starter areas (Northshire, camp narache, valley of trials, etc.) in classic buy can on pservers.
---
Oh okay, so call to arms never existed?
---
Will an enh shaman get a position at 60lvl raids
---
&gt; #nochanges
---
Ah, so you are in favor of LFG-addons like Call to arms.
---
[What else I'm supposed to do?](https://i.imgur.com/qIvnq1i.png)
---
Oi! That’s a grudgin’!
---
Thats the thing though, anyone who gets in is taying on for 24hrs, so anyone stuck in queue is never getting on.    
---
   
---
and you know people are going to use a fan with a pencil to automate movement on their character so they dont get disconnected, and never logout for a whole week
---
Undead mage. Weapon masters are alliance.
---
All of the new ones look wack
---
Pepe’s just a relatable, expressive froggie.
---
you have way more faith in blizzard than you should, my friend.
---
this "streamer" got world first naxx 40 clear. im sure its all just for money
---
At least 3-4 times a day. 
---
I even timed it out that after 30 minutes of inactivity it disconnects you. So on launch I’m going to log on 29 min before launch so as to get in que/not get dc’d due to inactivity. 
---
Will test this weekend if messing with the settings or creating a new character affects the 30 minutes.
---
Yeah, it’s a rough one out there. I basically sift through the information and honestly, I’m loving the cheat sheets people are making.
---
Waiting to see some for rogue pop up. Even as a week one vet, I’m open to all information :)

---
I really,REALLY hope something like iLVL addon doesn't happen for classic. I don't think it will since people have been playing on private servers for about a decade and never seen one of those.
---
Must be the "casual flu" I've heard about. If it gets bad they become "chronically noob".
---
For my tauren i cant decide between solid black or milk cow skin tone. Also what horn color looks best with each skin tone? I have 0 sense of fashion/style.
---
Why do you keep using updated models for something representing Classic?
---
I honestly thought those were old pre classic concepts, not the retail icons.....
---
I was afraid of that.
---
Moonglade. It's always been a special place. I've played druid since OG vanilla. Going to main a new class this time around though.
---
But you literally see the model in the center of your screen when you click it!
---
As someone who hasn’t decided on a name, class or server, me too!!!
---
I found the nagging wife guys

Personally I think merging servers is wrong unless they're pretty freaking low pop.
---
Grobbulus Mobbulus
---
hes in his mom's basement right now trying to figure out a statement of conformity
---
Both are true, that was barely an argument
---
Yeah, we've all dealt with burnout different extensions. Going back to the start masks a lot of that.
---
I love you man!
---
It did exist. Natur Enemy Castbar. I've used it.  I was mainly into pvp back then and it was essential to track all the CCs and similar.
---
even if there was there are a billion legit uses to have something like that running in the background. You're probably fine.
---
If you were bed ridden, would you really have something more important to do?
---
Good on you my dude. Smooth sailing out there!
---
I'm so glad to be in Azeroth where pet battles are not a thing. Praise be!
---
lol, yeah, if games were dying because of gatekeeping and toxic communities LoL, DOTA2, CSGO wouldn't be a thing. Chill a little dude, the only edgelord in this thread is you.
---
Keep yer feet on th' groun!
---
Cope
---
Agreed, much Horde feels from these names. I like.
---
The force is strong in your drugs.
---
The Fairbanks discord appears to have a widening group of guilds committed to stamping this out on both factions. I'm not worried honestly. If they try it they'll get rekked
---
I've never used it. Its cheating
---
Don't stop swiping ;)
---
It didn't early on but it got updated one day in.
---
I generally dump all the damage upfront and wand the rest of the time to max mana regen.
---
There definitely was a cast bar addon in vanilla wow.
---
Its the Matrix, a fake world theyve been pumping in our brain, juicing off us. - classic is the real world.
---
After taking the red pill (stress test), theres no going back.
---
If the Mrs was home before me I'd be in luck!
---
Well played.
---
You realize he's talking about an actual situation, right?
---
Fucking rude.
---
That problem with that mindset is what happens when the majority of the population begins using it? It becomes the norm, it becomes expected, and you can't get a group without it. Addons like this can and will ruin the experience for the entire population, and that is why addons thst conflict with the design of vanilla shouldn't be allowed.
---
That's a fantastic way to justify your shitty attitude. You're a classy individual.
---
There were a few top end guilds that were famous for being toxic to their raiders.
---
Dives from "wipe Club" the acting raid leader going on a tantrum durring ONY (The onyxia wipe animation)
---
Chitzu from the "six feet deep guild" - heavily toxic hardcore guild.
---
 Still the majority of the player base isn't like these examples. Look at MadseasonCow's series of famous wow players for more.
---
No goals, just enjoy the game
---
I logged on, did the nazjatar intro, and man I dunno i just instantly got extremely frustrated, killed 1 thing and then logged off.
---
In a word... Yes
---
In a couple more words... You may have a point, but still... Yes.
---
Yeah this. And more simply put: if someone wants to leave a server, why stop them?
---
There's something really rewarding about downvoting this guys comments
---
It's actually the staff transmog from WoD challenge dungeons.
---
It is a fucked up looking staff, but a staff nonetheless.
---
Possibly, I guess I’m more impressed by a skilled shaman than a skilled paladin. Totems are dope and spamming flash of light gets boring
---
That's literally impossible. They can't simultaneously cater to casuals and no one.
---
They're mutually exclusive.
---
I agree with all except server transfers. People shouldn't be forced to abandon a character and start fresh just because their server population dropped or the friend they want to play with joined a different server.
---
Gotta merk the opposing factions leaders
---
Is killing higher that big of an achievement, up there with getting both mounts?
---
Wall climbing? They probably are gonna make sure it’s not included. It was a glitch in the game. Made for some fun adventures though.
---
I don’t remember this, but then again, I was 15 and paying for anything other than my sub was ludicrous
---
This sounds like something the popo would say...
---
call to arms existed, LFG addons, but everyones throwing a fuzz about that one
---
Lol the wannabe purists on the sub are getting fucking ridiculous!
---
I've been wondering the same. The answers I've gotten are two; (1) a lot of Russians really dislike Russians the way Europeans do and (2) "normal" letters aren't usable on the Russian server so some Russians seek themselves to European server to practice/use international text.
---
Cant you put you keyboard on you chest and play like that ?
---
That what addons are for, better readability of information present for players having an easier time handling them.
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/SneakySuspiciousVelociraptorBIRB](https://clips.twitch.tv/SneakySuspiciousVelociraptorBIRB) 
---
Since it parses chat and send messages back to public chat channels, it's inclusive with people not using it, so it will never be mandatory. It defenitely never splittes player because there is not exclusiviness regarding it, it's a matter of preference regarding easy of use, as ALL ADDONS are.
---
Sounds like you are doing it right
---
Don't worry about it, there's no DK's in classic.
---
Have some fun.
---
Move on to other things when I stop having the fun.
---
Call to Arms.
---
unless i had a minimap addon that make changes to any of that, right?  
---
dude come on, we clearly disagree and youre grasping at straws in an attempt to prove yourself right.  just move on
---
Hail Gul’dan
---
It certainly feels like it to me too, and the trouble is that it's one of those things that if some are using it, then others are strongly nudged to use it too.
---
That's why it should a. Cost money b.  Only be available every 6 months
---
BWL and AQ40 are my only goals. Luckily they're pretty long term goals that will drive tons of smaller term goals in between. I'm also rolling a healer, something I've never done before, so it'll be a good challenge.
---
Wtf am I supposed to do this weekend? I almost downloaded retail because the wait is killing me.
---
Yes it will.
---
I only realized once i started to get into UI mods
---
I healed raids and my screen never looked that cluttered, that guy just did a crappy job of managing his add-ons. No reason to be displaying little profile pics next to players bars for one.
---
Sure dude, but I also had much more time and didn't mind spending 4 hours looking for the perfect group. I'd rather play wow now instead of lfg simulator
---

---
Really appreciate the comments here. I was getting really pumped about returning to classic but reading how it’s running of the retail client made me a bit worried I’d have to pump hundreds into a new PC.
---
But there is huntards
---
More like community concerns cycle. It's very inconsiderate and bigoted to mock legitimate community concerns born from passion, like LFG addons, skeletons, loot trading, RPPvP server, etc.
---
As with the last two "outrage cycle" concerns, ie last two community concerns, the Blizzard Classic Team has shown to be very humble and listening to the community concerns.
---
Shutting down feedback like this is not only toxic, it's counter productive.
---
It's essentially a perk for current subs of retail WOW. If you're subbed right now, you essentially have "priority" to get a name locked down. And it isn't like the sub is worthless, you could play retail while waiting if you think you wouldn't get your name if you waited until launch. It's not just a preorder you're sitting on your hands waiting for. The presentation they used might be off, but it's a perk for people who are subbed. If you're fiending to reserve a name, that's up to you to decide if it's worth paying early to get.
---
That was beautiful
---
AHHH UHGHH
---
God I feel like I'd just enjoy this game so much more if this sub didn't exist.  Why do 80% of the posts have to be toxic toward retail.  Hopefully when the game goes live people are busy playing and won't continue this silly us vs them mentality.  A majority of classic wow players are probably playing retail as is.
---
This attitude is how we started down the path to what became BFA today.
---
I sincerely hope they do not cater to the "just don't use the convenience features lol" crowd. Obviously stuff like this alters the attitudes and playstyles of the community, which affect everyone. Therefore, things that will be bad for that experience, such as this addon that allows you to avoid making friends and building a contact list because you can always just grab a dps from LFG, is detrimental to one of the core experiences of playing an MMO.
---
Just talk to people and make friends as level up. Group up with people and be a cool guy, and people will add you to their friends list. Join a guild, for crying out loud! Spamming chat for tanks and healers should be your last resort. Actively participate with other people and you will have other people to play with.
---
Addons like this remove the need to do that, which eventually leads to modern WoW, where no one ever talks and other players might as well just be bots.
---
Only possible when you’re running with people you know / guildies or if you’re the RL.
---
Death threats and harassment because someone likes something you don't is warranted? Jesus.
---
if I lived near one of those I would be forever putting up stupid shit.
---
What do you mean by "realm size"?  Total number of accounts with characters on the realm?  Or max concurrency?
---
Play a healer and watch your friends list multiply daily
---
http://www.giyf.com
---
Holy crap, that was close. Glad you were able to find the restraint.
---
2-3 months ago i was leveling a mage with no questhelper stuff on (objectives hidden on the map, etc), no heirlooms, no help from my main in any way, etc.
---
Had a lot of fun with it, but got stuck at about lvl 83 and just couldnt keep going.  I realized i had no real desire to quest beyond Wrath zones and it really killed the vibe.
---
 it's in the game currently. it's not getting broken 3 days before launch.
---
Every time someone makes a post about something like this, a whole horde of people come out of the woodwork and talk about how it should be banned and they hate it. It wont be hard to find enough to make a guild and not use it.
---
This isn't a race. Other then PVP, it doesnt really matter who has cleared what.
---
&gt; you could play retail while waiting
---
I clearly stated I have no interest in the current release client or anything it offers.  This doesn't increase the value to me at all.
---
And as I said, it isn't that reserving a name was ever a big deal.  But they felt it was a big enough deal to notify me, and waited until I was logged in and actually ready to type that name in before I saw an overt indication that I needed a sub to do so.
---
I'm not fiending for anything, I'm just pointing out a significant flaw in their execution.  I would've been perfectly fine otherwise waiting until after launch.
---
&gt; If we want a WoW Classic experience, we need these mods to be banned.
---
Except DBM style mods WERE IN VANILLA. I'm not sure why you have this weird idea that it just wasn't a thing in vanilla to have mods that alerted you to boss debuffs or something, but that is flat out untrue.
---
the arugment you presented is disingenuous when you alter the assumptions of the given scenario.
---
I think ideally the game should be designed without DBM in mind. And I think Classic very much is.
---
That is a bit of an issue with retail, DBM is clearly in the mind of the people who design the raids with how many mechanics they have and how nuanced they are.
---
If it were up to me, the only add ons allowed would be mostly cosmetic, in designing and moving around your UI and stuff like that.
---
You can only form groups with pen and paper invites!
---
Take a look at the Grail addon on willitclassic.  You may be able to use it to keep track of quest completion.
---
Go ahead and call me out in two years if I’m wrong, but they will not force Classic players to do TBC. I promise.
---
If you don't like the addon, then don't use it. Period. If someone like it then let him freely use it. It's everybody's choice. Just respect everyone decisions.
---
There is nothing as "falling behind" in vanilla. The game does not start on 60 as retail does. Many people reached 60 very late in vanilla and still had fun. I did not raid much and pretty much PvP'd the whole way and on 60, who cares about gear, I wanna see ally die. There is no "correct" way to play, so you can do whatever you want.
---
Any good primers on how the servers are turning out? I'm interested in US East coast PVP servers.
---
ya it was really odd. i spent more time between deleting and recreating with the name "qt" and didnt lose it. i think i just got really fucking unlucky lol
---
I haven't laughed this hard in a while
---
It's too slow? I had it faster but it hurt my eyes, so I thought it might be too much for others.
---
Does this include snowflakes who can not take some polite advice on how to play their class and pull correctly in a mid lvl key in an M+?
---
Blizzard has said a server listed as Medium realm-pop right now would have been considered "Full" in Vanilla WoW realm pops. Servers that are listed as 'full' right now are more than any Vanilla realms could handle.
---
Did you not play WoW before the dungeon finder came out? Or do you not remember how fucking stupid it was to have to spam global channels for several hours whilst sitting afk in Orgrimmar just in an effort to get a group together? *That* shit wasn't fun or engaging in the slightest.
---
Wow... doesn't seem hard to believe.
---
We will see :)
---
Those are usually free to incentivise transferring
---
If it's anything like private servers, 4-8 hours.
---
But of course the issue becomes people finding loopholes to stop themselves from logging off.
---
How does that one song go?
---
Oh yeah
---
This is America
---
Made soup in the instant pot. Also, have a couple pounds of beef jerky, dried fruit and nuts, bananas, Lacroix.. However, I went ahead and grabbed a case of dew and some fruit snacks and rice crispy treats, because why not. Classic wow only happens once (twice?)
---
Please make more!
---
This addon only uses the api that's available via blizzard. Secondly
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg) 
---
* When looking for people it will periodically write in a **public** channel of your choice to make people without the Addon aware of the group.
---
Alexensual was right
---
There will be more shaman than either hunter or lock.
---
I’d say you could’ve leaked the information without making it known who it came from. But now you’ve dragged our whole server into your own drama.
---
that's what I thought
---
&gt;the most gear dependent dps spec being the highest rated for dungeons, the places where you're least likely to have optimal gear
---
What warrior biased retard made this?
---
This is correct it was in 1.12 and it's been said in a couple of interviews to be like this in classic.
---
Still waiting for source.
---
everytime i play WoW i listen to this :3
---
I don’t care either way, but saying “don’t like it don’t use it” is a stupid argument when we’ve seen addons and blizzard features change the way the game is played, even if you don’t use those tools.
---
Not enough bawls
---
The 15K cap estimate is *way, way* too modest.
---
Given layering, I fully expect Blizzard could easily get 100K concurrent on a realm.  Meaning realm population caps would be correspondingly far, far higher than 15K.
---
There will be A LOT of subs on Monday with no decent server to choose.
---
Went and bought my mountain dew and doritos earlier today. Cant wait for monday night!
---
No, I want everyone to be able to experience WoW classic how they want. 
---
You are free to find 40 other like minded friends to raid with. And if you cant find 40 people, then it sounds like no one wants this banned to begin with.
---
Things just mean more when they're hard or even tedious to obtain.
---
Resubbed for name reservation (which in the end didn't matter since my friends and I are all jumping ship lol) while out of town. Uninstalled retail when I got back home.
---
&gt; but after WoTLK something about WoW drove me away...
---
wonder if that had anything to do with the absolute castration of the class
---
So are you arguing that they have messed up by copy+pasting(they literally rebuilt the game from the ground up, hence the 3 year development)? And that they aren’t capturing the Nost market? I’m not catching your drift.
---
they won't do this.
---
you need some pussy, cuz it seems like all that you suck on is blizzard dick lmao
---
Classic is not difficult. Never confuse time needed for actually difficulty.
---
Depends. If they're competing with me for resources, I don't want to help them become more efficient at doing so.
---
I did exactly that when I (very briefly) played BfA back in October.
---
It still felt like a completely different game. Because it is one.
---
For some reason I always think that Sunder Armor requires Defensive Stance, which is not the case.
---
The devs have explicitly stated this. LFG is fundamentally against the design of vanilla wow. It's not a debate, LFG is not vanilla and should not be in the game.
---
I don't get why people are getting all up in arms over the add-on. Yes it takes away from the original experience, but ifp you don't want it don't download it.
---
well yeah, devs are out devving; customer support is supporting.

zero. i'm rolling shaman and im going enhance. fuck the haters.

Can anyone make this for warlock?

If Blizzard just stays quiet then people will just say that Blizzard doesn't care and are letting people do what they want.  Blizzard is probably discussing it internally but they have no obligation to give us a step by step plan.
---
YES PLEASE!
---
This is the case for me but we are probably playing on razorgore.
---
The central argument is that this style of mod takes away from the immersion and difficulty of the supposedly most difficult and epic encounters of the game. The others you mention feel like coordination tools and don't alter the play experience anywhere near as much as DeadlyBoss mods do. You know it and I know it.
---
Gold buying/selling is affecting the game as a whole. You're modifying the economy and bending the power curve to your favor by breaking the game's rules. You're getting an advantage in PvP and a head start on gearing for without having to work for it like you're supposed to. You are almost certainly going to be shitter in your groups, too, and not because you're a casual, those people are happy where they are, but because you SHOULD be a casual but instead you chose to cheat your way to the top. You might be able to fool people at first, but they'll figure it out once they realize you have no idea what you're doing in the game, and you'll end up with a bad reputation on the server, making it more difficult for you to get a group.
---
Also it just seems pathetic. Like why would you ever even consider paying someone to play a video game for you? If you hate playing the game that much why don't you just go do something you actually like instead of shitting up a game you clearly don't enjoy? I mean, do you pay people to watch TV shows you don't like and then go try to participate in the communities surrounding them without actually knowing anything about it except that you didn't want to watch it? The only explanation is that you see no issue with representing yourself as an accomplished player even though you're actually just a cheating scrub who doesn't even like the game, which makes you a lowlife in my book. The whole thing you're buying is literally a lie. A facade that allows you to pretend you did something you didn't do.
---
Anyway I'm done discussing this with you, I've said my piece and there's no point continuing the conversation. You can have the last word. I would ask that you consider this: would you feel ashamed if other players knew you bought your accomplishments in game? Think about that, and I sincerely hope for your sake and the sake of the game at large that you reconsider.
---
Aaaaand you have no argument anymore. Have a good time with Retail!
---
I DONT HAVE A PROBLEM
---
It's with all the fucks they used to give.
---
Exactly, this is PvE content. It doesnt matter what other guilds do.
---
Want to bet reddit gold Blizz won't?

"This could mean the end of the world... of Warcraft."

The amount of cope from retail peasants in here is truly staggering

I just associate having the monitor tilted that way with scripting. I'd constantly be stressed about how I should be working lol
---
That boomlin is a fucking unit
---
I didn’t quest past the opening of Pandaria.
---
How does this negatively affect non-users of the addon.
---
Lol. I also agree with you about the Undead mounts. I think they have some of the best mounts along with Trolls and Night Elves.
---
They do need all the help they can get.
---
Oh yea that guy was just a word of mouth thing
---
is this for aoe or dps? im new to the game might take this up
---
Oddly political analogy but I get your meaning. If the demand is actually there, isn't it better met in the engine than completely externally?
---
We can talk about banning DBM once it automatically moves you out of a fire :\^)
---
You already asked me that, are you okay mate?
---
I switched from Shazz to Firemaw. I must say I don't regret this since the people on the discord are fucking cancer and I don't know what is gonna happen when classic is live how people act on that server
---
True but vanilla guilds are normally much larger.

I remember when gamers didn't die of caffeine overdoses. Good times.

Also worth remember to get up and move, deep vein thrombosis is also an unfortunately real thing.

Good luck proving it.
---
This is the contest I subbed for
---
Yes, battle.net messages work across all blizzard games. even Classic
---
&gt; horde are huge pussies
---
Weird insult from the faction that literally has to be bribed to turn on WM...
---
Shaman
---
Respect must be earned, and BFA has not earned my respect.
---
Vanilla was extremely alliance heavy, so due to nostalgia it would be higher Alliance pop. However 10 years of horde domination on retail and many streamers going it are likely what would cause it for vanilla, as we are seeing on surveys. How to we combat it? Go alliance
---
Server transfers are fine, everything else is hard NO. Can’t believe these people trying to say appearance changes are fine. Part of the draw of classic is the investment in your character. Your gear, your looks, your reputation all define you in your community. Allowing for appearance changes would Segway into gear appearance changes, which leads to the shitty version of wow we all want to escape from.
---
I just clicked this. Haha. Thanks for sharing.
---
I highly doubt Barrens Chat would be a reason why someone picks Horde specifically, especially since you are really only there from lvls 12-20ish and only go through the zone briefly after that.
---
The few that pick horde because of these reasons will not be why there is a faction imbalance if there is one.
---
&gt; Dont forget this sub is a small percent of the overall player base ( I hope )
---
Haha, that "I hope" killed me. But after chatting with a few people here, I hope too.
---
Why do you want a cast bar telling you when the enemy is going to cast? You can see the animation  isnt that enough?
---
Why do you want threat meters you should watch your dps without it.
---
Your argument is flawed as long as you defend other addons that do the thing your complaining about
---
Everything I've read about shaman resto PvP says they're better elemental?  Or is that just the tryhard crowd chanting loudly lol.
---
Given it just turned Saturday here in Europe, and release is midnight Monday night, can I say that release is in 2 days? Yes, or yes?
---
I logged into retail.  Looked around at my level 100 hunter that was all transmogged into very subdued looking leathers.
---
Then I realized that I'm not going to be able to that look, as I'll just be in random mail and a mishmash of quest rewards. 
---
Oh well.
---
I just downloaded it. How mad are u right now?
---
6-7 races... I think you forgot how many races exist...
---
Yes, lets go back to talking about skeletons.
---
you are not only miserable, but also extremely misinformed
---
dont they say move speed is the best stat to get while leveling
---
Yeah I gotta check on extenze the male enhancement shaman
---
I logged onto my 110 hunter from legiong and got killed by A yellow 120 dear in darkshore.. then logged off

It kind of works but it's high effort very low reward.

Topping the charts would imply you were on the top, i.e. 1st.

Hunters have a role and will be taken to all content, but probably only 2-3 per raid in hardcore guilds. I don't care if my guild takes 5.

Me.  I’ve made my own basic questing guide.  It outlines class quests, profession quests, and when it’s finished, attunements.  The rest is tbd as I go, but my backstory (Grob Mob y’all)  is hatred for the dark iron dwarves, so
---
Same feelings here. I don't like the idea of being pressured into using it because it would be an advantage after all but I would use it (like most i think). I think a lot of people here have bad memories or have heard horror stories of group making taking forever. I never experienced this but also was never on a dead or very low pop server. With these servers being so much bigger in population compared to back then I don't see it being a problem ever.
---
Yeah the icon was the inspiration of course, but it's so low detail, we wanted a bit more realism. 
---
We sent the artist this https://m.imgur.com/a/mdQ7b1x and let him have creative freedom beyond that. We are very pleased.

Why does our protagonist look like fry from Futurama? And if he is so then what class is he? I'm going to say hunter for obvious reasons.

All servers will have imbalance. Whether it's 1% imbalance or 40% in imbalance. This is not a thing that is calm batted, it's a part of what makes each servers community

Theat meters and enemy cast bars make it trivial to so they should go, or is that where your skill level drops and you cant clear content without them? So they have to stay yeah?

Mage is fairly safe in my opinion.  It's pure DPS, so there is no scrutiny over hybrid builds or talent spec for the most part.  Any given raid will want at least a few mages to provide the AI buffs, food and water, and portal at the end plus curse removal if necessary.  In PVP, the survivability of frost spec is decent for the damage potential.  Being a mage main was probably the highlight of my time in vanilla and I was typically 1 of 5-6 mages in our raid.  Overall, I'd say it is at least as reliable a choice as any other DPS option.

Lol go back to retail. Summoning stones never automatically made you a group, nobody used them. There was no addon that did that either.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=10725 is the only mechanical chicken in my life
---
It is honestly fine.
---
You can do many quests solo. For harder content and group content, people will work at forming groups so it is possible. You will find groups easy as long as you are open to it.
---
Aaah, thank you.
---
Drivel
---
Raid and dungeon mechanics (which is what the addon type in reference are used for) have NEVER gotten easier. Retail has gotten more and more complex, especially compared to anything that Vanilla has to offer. Anyone that claims they have has clearly not been playing the game beyond LFR, which isn’t even base level difficulty, and their input is beyond worthless.
---
I'll repeat: The only reason to advocate for the existence of these addons is to (i) progress as fast as possible to compare yourself favorably to others and (ii) to make content easier, presumably because you don't like difficulty or want to do the hard work of learning an encounter and learning from experiencing that encounter.  
---
There is no other reason why someone might support the existence of an addon like this. It was likely created initially just for this purpose -- to help players "beat the devs" or "beat the other guilds" as soon as possible. Look where that got us. Your notion that this mod had no comparative intent is untenable.
---
The addon automates that process.  Anyone can do everything this addon does, it's the automation that's the problem.

Wait... can we spam it with a bazillion black lotus for 1g so that their little AH bot sells their stock for 3G? :D

Correct. He made them basically the same size so it makes hers look bigger given she has smaller arms.

Yeah you replied to me. Who was replying to the "most" comment. Learn to follow a thread lol

Yeah, that doesnt work if they fully embrace the Eve "N+1" motto.
---
I played horde for awhile but alliance in vanilla/BC Iron Forge and Alliance zones carry that nostalgia for me.
---
It's a shame.... Hearthstone is like this with deck trackers
---
I downloaded it, and plan on using it while leveling and for as long as it’s available. And guess what: I’m still going to have to interact and build my reputation on the server. I’m still going to /1 and /2 lfg x dungeon. But this legitimately organizes other people looking on my server for better visibility.
---
What an unforgivable sin.
---
Best guild on Bigglesworth, hands down.
---
&gt;You might want to “clean up” after you’re done and delete and reinstall classic since arctium will modify game assets which is against the tos and banable
---
Hey, I'd love to get a source on that, you can pm me if it's a questionable link
---
but then the month and day can be confused
---
It works out perfectly. Its only useful for druids because the weapon they are using does not affect the amount of dps the moves in form. Basically a stat stick. Any otherclass would be nerfed as heck when using the weapon. The buff is only there while your using it and the weapon is terrible dps for a 60
---
By this logic, you shouldn't be able to customize your UI because that also gives you an advantage. Disadvantage to everyone else in regards to what? Getting server first? If you dont want to use these addons, you can find another 39 people who won't want to use it, or just won't mind if you're not using it. 
---
If you're so dedicated that you're aiming for server first you're probably skilled enough and know every fight like the back of your hand so you should be able to install the addons and disable notifications and times and none would be the wiser.
---
If you're just upset cause guilds using the addons clear bosses earlier than you and just get more loot, (which I dont think makes a difference, the mechanics is vanilla, especially Molten Core, are just too simple for them to cost a team of skilled players a kill) then it just sounds like you're jealous of someone else getting gear and your problem isn't woth the addons.
---
TL;DR - I just cant see how BigWigs would make the difference between a kill and a wipe to the point where it would put you at a disadvantage with other guilds. Idiots will be idiots and will die with or without BigWigs.

2 days 23 hours and 55 minutes.

Not that i'm counting or anything. That would be pathetic.
---
I use to know the top tier guilds without having to raid and just being a pvper now I know no one except method the game is so automated now it's disgusting
---
they cant handle the thought of their very valuable collection of store mounts and pets becoming meaningless or getting no attention
---
Rogue does feel like a good choice. I bet they end up being underrepresented due to the warrior circle jerk.
---
Lol what? Although I don't care about this change suggestion nor the LFG add-on, how can u compare the two? One drastically changes the way the game is played, the other has absolutely no effect.
---
 As someone who has less time than I did in Vanilla I don't mind the LFG add-on, but to say they are the same is just ignorance.
---
You definitely can tell this sub has blown up with tourists.... people wanting race and appearance changes in classic. You were probably the wall of no crowd gtfo and go back to retail &lt;3
---
Does it really matter if its imbalanced? As long as it's not 90-10 were good
---
It is kinda weird to me the people that *have* to have their name. But then again, I have never really played a game like this where it was possible for me to get on the ground floor and get a good, simple name. I have always been used to figuring out the naming tricks to kinda get what you want.

I believe the timer is much shorter than 30 minutes and you can only get up to 30 minutes by clicking around a bunch. 30 is the maximum and you'll be kicked out no matter what.

Many welps, many welps, handle it.

Because they monitor player subscriptions and name reservation activity both before and after lunch. Lizard add servers as blizzard deems them necessary based on the data they have and we don't

I really have no idea why they nerfed the breath bar.  They completely eliminated the challenge.

That's what addons does, they change your interface so you can better handle information you have.

this is why priest tempts me but its a shit money maker

Retail losing 70% of its playerbase to a BC or Wrath server is just your opinion to start, so unless you can give me some proof that this would happen (more than something like "I heard x people say they'd play on one" because that's bullshit when most players will just jump ship in a few weeks). Now some players would definitely ditch retail or w.e other MMO they're playing for Wrath/BC servers, but to pull out a number as high as 70% with no future content promised past the original raid tiers is just asinine LOL. Also, retail is not unsuccessful just because WoW is not retaining the extremely high player-base that it peaked at in wrath... Just look at other games like Everquest, DOAC, diablo 2, etc none of them are growing and they all have very small player-bases, but were very popular before... Thus successful. That's just how games work, as they age the population goes down, but yet WoW is still able to retain a large portion of that population... So tell me again how the most popular MMO of the past and still is the most popular MMO (even though it was released over a decade ago) is not doing good enough...
---
I'm only familiar with 19 twinking, sorry.

WTF are you talking about? Bears are the BEST dungeon tanks. A LOT better than warriors.
---
That's basically fashion in a nutshell
---
Oh, so you didn't read the post? ok, got it.
---
If so, you aren't funny :(
---
So because WoW subscribers peaked in Wrath...nobody wanted classic?
---
do they carry over? if so good
---
Which is something retail already has. Meeting stones!
---
That's the thing that's killing the fear for me...these guys are not going to have the manpower to control supply like they think they will.
---
I like the layout of this. Well done
---
WoW classic will fail... JUST WATCH! Guys, it REALLY will fail! All my mounts, achievements and time invested into retail will NOT BE FOR NOTHING. See my new store mount, cool right?!!
---
Nothing but cope.
---
you'd better not sail up the thames and become king again!
---
Long term means 6 weeks?
---
I haven't resubbed yet, however I will on Sunday or Monday. When I do, I'll probably just explore old areas in retail that I miss, leading up to and including Legion. Zero interest in anything BFA though.

Combat swords
---
Imagine not being able to spell ad.
---
That blows man! Another post lost, but never forgotten
---
It was a lot less common because world buffs are a lot less common than private servers have people thinking they are.
---
based on the comment of reality?  get out of the basement, kid.
---
just go to the timer countdown and do the math man
---
You need to farm soul shards sometimes.  I was never a fan of Warlocks so I'm not the greatest answer.
---
it is not a pain at all. maybe at endgame when you need to farm enough to summon the whole raid but during levelling it’s fine
---
where you see that?
---
Server transfers were in Vanilla. I know, my guild was forced to change at AQ40.
---
I see nothing AT ALL wrong with buyable mounts, pets, or ANY cosmetic items. As long as it's cosmetic I see no problems. 
---
Cosmetic items WILL be coming, Blizz can't just lose money on this, they have shareholders to account to. It's literally the law for a public company to put shareholders profits first.
---
Name, Cosmetic and Race changes are unacceptable.
---
For 5 seconds after casting a spell, you don't regain mana. So it's better to frontload your mana use and then switch to a wand instead of mixing wand hits in between. With the second strategy you hit the 5 seconds much more often instead of just a couple times, leading to less total mana for a fight.
---
Every class has stuff they need to manage.
---
Ngl, people on this sub REALLY like to tell you how to think.  I asked a question the other day about a good leveling guide after I noticed Joana's won't be available anymore (I haven't been following Classic anything closely until the last couple of days) and probably more than half of the replies I got only existed to tell me that I shouldn't use a leveling guide.  Of those, the large majority were just straight up insults about how I'm some combination of retarded and lazy.
---
Like, how about you just don't reply instead of trying to force your shit onto me?  You play the game how you want, I'll play it how I want.  60 takes a long ass time in vanilla, and I know for certain that I will enjoy less than half of it (it'll be fun and exciting in the beginning, and nostalgic here and there throughout, but for the most part it's gonna be just a grind for me).  Using a guide makes perfect sense for me because it'll stretch that new/exciting part as far into the process as possible, and then help finish up the slog afterwards as quickly as possible.  I also don't want or need to spend what will probably amount to an extra couple weeks or more of play to hit 60, when it's already going to take me at least a month in real time, probably closer to 2.   
---
I don't often get annoyed by reddit posts, but that shit was annoying.  You can take your little beliefs and fuck right off, I'll take the replies that had actual value and go do what I was gonna do anyway.
---
I'm not playing with friends.  They couldn't keep up with my druid

There’s a Hunter, Pally, Priest, and maybe a warrior but I think he’ll end up playing Horde with a seperate group of mates in the end.

They were not automated to this extent.

Anyone that tries to give you shit for gear score in classic, add that sucker to the ignore list with a spam filter app.
---
Im 90% sure its usually someone who just made it themselves and posted it with that name for cute points
---
Your soundcard works perfectly
---
You are nitpicking small details, spamming "LFM 1 DPS RFK" and sending "invite please" messages are not the meaningful interactions. It's not talking with people. Let's say we remove the join button and the auto invite option. Now you the player joining will right click party leader name, select whisper and send the message "invite", the party leader will right click his name, select the "invite" option and he joined. It really changes something?
---
Player that created the group has no information regarindg level, spec, positioning in the world of the guy that joined. Guess what comes next?
---
It doesn't present you the perfect people from a poll of players queueing, there is no queue, players need to select your specific advertise message (as you do in default chat usage). It doesn't select players regarding gear, from other realms, people that don't use the addon won't even notice it and are included in the experience, players are not teleported to the dungeon.
---
All the meaningful interaction will still be there.
---
all the best on your recovery!
---
look at the twitter replies to tips asking to talk with kung. it's there
---
Warriors begging for AI and DS, what a world
---
As it looks right now, I don't think we need to ban classicLFG. 
---
A window that displays LFG and LFM is no big deal, it might even be something that I would use. 
---
But that auto-invite/accept was present in any version of the addon makes me very suspicious of the dev.

Many people on this sub probably work in a professional industry.  Many of them probably try to do the best job they can, and if they work in a public facing role or a consumer focused industry they try to create something decent. Even some of the folks who make it to senior executive level are like that.
---
The guy that made Classic possible basically did it as his side project, working quietly on getting the original world data to work with the current gen engine.  He did it because he wanted to see it happen and it interested him.  Not because he wanted to rape you for every last dime you have.
---
Accountants decide fucking nothing in companies.  That's utter horseshit.  They're beancounters that handle billing and payments and nothing else.   Executives and senior managers consider projects on their merits and allocate budgets.  Sometimes those project ideas come from people down among the rank and file.  Some of those budgets are aimed at driving profit, and some are investments in R&amp;D which are largely a gamble.
---
Companies are just groups of people.  Some are assholes, but on the whole most are ordinary decent folks like the rest of us because they are us.
---
Combat is the only spec for pvp honestly you are better going swords in p1 for pve since the preraid options for daggers are not competitive and combat daggers just isn't competitive in pvp
---
I don't think it'll be that bad if it does stick around or gain popularity, because its not pulling people from other servers, so you still have that community to deal with and a reputation to uphold.
---
Meanwhile, one night, while thaddius was already farm...
---
Our MT's computer kept having seizures and we kept wiping. We all kept fucking with him over it. 
---
And we hear some crashing and stuff breaking over vent then silence. We didn't see or hear from him for a couple of weeks.
---
Apparently he picked it up and threw it across the room with everything still connected.
---
Sure, we could have just had someone else tank, but, this was more amusing.
---
He showed back up with a new computer and all was right with the world again.
---
did somebody say Thuderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Haha I was going to say that as a lock, my version of this is throwing agony on people's targets as I run by :)
---
I mean what's going to happen when they decide WoW: Classic+?  QoL changes will eventually come, more in the way of content after Naxx.  I'd  say they will tweak classing and gear at that time as well.  The NoChanges only effects the earlier form of WoW: Classic.
---
Rogues don't have any buffs to give right? :(
---
Yeah, it was very marginal in Vanilla, but it was sometimes useful when dealing with more than one mob.
---
I never raided back in classic, but I'm not going to use them because I want that experience. But I will defend the people who do want to use them. They have already cleared the content before, and it is simply a means to an end.
---
Where can I find the druid cheat sheet?
---
Go for the mage. Different specs are great to play around with and it’s really fun in pvp
---
Jeebus, when you compare it really makes me wonder why they ever scrapped the old art styles.
---
Perhaps, but for Classic is kind of a different beast. Getting to the dungeon is such a hassle, it’s often easier to teach/cope with bad players.
---
I just don't get it. What's the joke?
---
honestly how far up your ass must your moronic mind be to believe this is accurate? like I genuinely find it hard to believe someone with at least basic motor functions can reasonable come to such a fucking stupid conclusion.
---
Imsdal 💟
---
hm. I thought BC was the best wow expansion ever.
---
i believe 1.12 they were all linked other than like the cross faction ah
---
This would absolutely ruin my day, I made sure to set expectations with my gf early and very seriously
---
I've got s rohue twink who loves to do it from behind.dm
---
From Combat Sword to Assasination Dagger. My apologies, i just now noticed you were talking about combat dagger.
---
Storms storming wtf? Also awaiting, looting wtf? Clashing so doesn't fit.
---
What does the addon do that hurts the game ?
---
#I'VE GOT BALLS OF STEEL
---
Female dwarf paladin
---
did you actually put that black box over a curse word
---
&gt;  that other wise went unseen by the majority of people
---
Pure bullshit. The only reason raids went unseen was because people didn't want to see them. As I said, joining a pug was easy. You just couldn't teleport in from a city and bulldoze through the raid without a word, you had to actually put effort in to get geared enough to get in and complete it, and maybe get attuned.
---
It might take a few extra weeks to get attuned and geared if you work full-time, but so what? They'll get to experience the raid as current content if they want to, no problem. The raid tiers last months, there's plenty of time.
---
It's easier to explain why you're wrong by linking you to somebody that can word it a lot better. Current WoW is just a shitshow of an MMORPG.
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfTt_Q795XvZa2t2gAahfF5G3zp56n04oTALPvNAsFM/edit
---
!Remind me 6 months. Let's see where this game is when new xpac is on the horizon and classic is full of dead realms when most players realize there's no real progression.
---
Sick banana, bro.
---
Should have said Oof .
---
I just sent one in just as dramatic as OP's email saying it would "ruin my experience also.
---
People just have to understand there's going to be a lot more than 3,000 people on a server, so a single LFG chat just isn't going to work. 
---
Maybe it will take the #NoChanges committee seeing the shit show it will be once layering is gone to realize they are wrong.
---
Why do you get to decide where the line is?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oJ09dboUTk
---
They won't do which? If you mean run their anti-cheat against add-ons, they've done so previously. If you mean it likely won't come to that in this case then I agree. Can you elaborate perhaps?
---
I can't believe this shit what happened to #nochanges I'm done I'm unsubbing (haven't even subbed yet) and I'm boycotting blizzard till my heart stops.
---
I was wondering this aswell, I don't think they will support twitch as it's not in classic spirit
---
Cross realm BGs did exist in Vanilla and waiting in long queues is objectively bad having to make a group yourself isn't.
---
Sure the solution the the BG queues cause problems but not to the extent as retails I want epics for being afk mentality.
---
This looks like a PvE build, which makes me wonder why you have Spiritual Focus instead of Divine Intellect. Otherwise it looks pretty good. You can probably go 5/5 Benediction if your holy paladins are always doing BoM (a lot of them pick up imp BoM) but don't assume that's the case until you get raids going. Otherwise it looks fine.
---
Nothing personal, but putting a WoW related thing on a spongebob image counts as low effort.
---
I apologize if I caused you unhappiness
---
Call to arms (Same bulletin board function) 
---
Lazypig (auto accept group invites and summons by friend/guild members)  
---
Leatrix (message raid leader for autoinvite) 
---
These were undoubtedly available for vanilla. Leatrix was also redone for classic so you’ll need to get that banned as well.
---
Night elves have mettle not metal.
---
Will you do a 48 hrs version?
---
give them Light and run off into the woods.
---
I love how, whenever anybody says they like the addon, this community basically responds with "You think you do, but you don't"
---
I reserved all 3 of the same names I used to use.
---
1 is the same race/class, the other two are different.
---
What do you expect? Literally nothing to talk about since everyone here can only think about playing classic in 3 days.
---
*sitting in queue in 3 days.

I like trains.
---
Sure, but it's not an in-game rendering, so why choose to make it look like poorly aged garbage?
---
Nothing actually, I don't get why people are up in arm when it comes to this addon.
---
Great tip thank you!
---
Rouge is really good at making your cheeks look nice and red. I dont know what type of makeup "mage" or "hunter" are supposed to be.
---
MY AUTHENTIC CLASSIC EXPERIENCE REEEEE
---
&gt; Once you're done playing for the night/day be sure to turn off your computer to let it rest 
---
Everything is great advice, but this mate? :-D The PC does not need to rest. If you meant that you should turn it off so it helps you rest, then yes!
---
Haha I said the same thing out loud
---
Upvote for both of you
---
Like the other guy said, don't bother.      
---
People don't want to know what it does, they just see red when the words LFG pops up.
---
Saw some people being mad about it totally being cross realm because someone told them that, even saw someone wondering if it teleported players to the dungeons.
---
All they will see is traffic coming from your home.
---
Did it in vanilla as well
---
I peronsally made http://i.picpar.com/qgBd.png this, but some of the weapons are off. So long as you have a weapon and a shield, you can take probably all the dungeons up till maybe ZF with Arms or Fury. You don't need prot, just defensive stance and people with half a brain.
---
Yet it is in the code. I can post it if you would like.
---
Sounds like he needs to avoid streaming. Look at what happened to Etika...
---
Exactly my point lol !!!
---
I love lamp.
---
Didnt some of these addons interact/communicate with other users of said addons in raids to increase accuracy?
---
In vanilla. The skill of the player playing the class makes all the difference in the world. Way  more so than Retail I mean. Just something to keep in mind.
---
the curse word! if proper protocol isnt observed they risk releasing the black plague - it is described in the great runestone of old.
---
Haha, glad someone had a sense of humor
---
Press X for doubt. 
---
Seriously though, my 2 most memorable Bill scenes/episodes are the ones where he thinks he's a woman and talks in a high pitched voice, and the scene where he climbs up on the roof and when Hank asks him what he's doing he just casually says "Ahh I'm just up here to kill myself." And Hank just says "Well good luck with that." Or something lol
---
I made a dwarf warrior named Jimlee. You have my axe
---
They are probably killing a slightly different mob that is taking forever.
---
Thanks, that was super helpful!
---
We're too busy sucking each others dicks and watching tranny porn to rig the survey this time, sorry kid.
---
That's a good ui even for modern standards tbh. Though I would have downsized the raid frames a bit and move them to down center just above your cast bar. That's the usual resting position of your mouse so healing will feel the most natural.
---
Count me in!
---
Definitely a hunter.
---
You'll need to provide more information on your experience with WoW, your play style, realm type, faction, etc. to get any good feedback. Honestly though, I'd say just roll all three and feel it out for yourself.
---
Me
---
Right. So you agree your argument doesn’t hold much water then.
---
It’s still only on the realm you’re playing on.... the only social part it’s potentially damaging is repeatedly posting LFG/LFM for whatever dungeon in the LFG channel. You’re still grouping and communicating with people on the server you’re playing on, not cross realm with people you’ll never see again.
---
Don't have any buffs to give as a Hunter, but I'll usually hit whatever they are attacking with a serpent sting and raptor strike as i run by.
---
Thank you, very cool.
---
Ah tanaris...
---
If you enjoy PvP you will definitely not be bored playing mage. There is a really high skill ceiling and tons fun stuff you can do. Great burst, great mobilty and the best aoe in the game. 
---
Also you have the benefit of being super viable at endgame. Mages are always in demand for any dungeon or raid. 
---
Warlocks are not far behind in PvE and also have a really high skill ceiling. Fearsome in wPvP and very flavorful. 
---
Druids are incredibly good in bgs. Fantastic solo play with speed, survivability, stealth etc etc. and still perfectly viable in endgames although often as healers. Really flexible and fun class.
---
I think you'll have fun whatever class you pick. Can't really go wrong either way.
---
It's kind of shit that this isn't allowed, if you're really serious. It's an MMO where you can choose how to interact with others. You can choose who you want to kill, help, ignore, etc. It also even makes sense thematically when you consider the fact the Alliance and Horde work together multiple times in the story, even in the story of vanilla WoW (AQ) to achieve greater goals.
---
&gt; Looking for Group? It's an excellent tool that allows me to interact with a much larger player base. 
---
Look at this dude, *interact* he says. I wish people in LFG interacted. Nobody talks in dungeons or LFR, even pugs since Normal is so easy.
---
&gt; Not everyone has the time needed to dedicate themselves to a raiding experience.
---
Raid tiers last months, you can get geared for Normal pugs in a couple weeks even. The only people who don't have time are the poor bastards on 80 hours per week + 20 hours commuting. What's next, access to scaled versions of the raids from level one for people who can only play for 30 minutes per week?
---
&gt; Sharding? Because being stuck in a zone with hundreds of other people trying to complete the exact same daily quest was so fun and enthralling.
---
Overpopulated zones were an issue, but no realm community is a way bigger issue. Nobody has a real presence, you never see the same guy twice. Current WoW is like a house where every-time you wake up, your roommates are different people and you'll probably never see your old roommate again. You don't get much of a chance to build relationships organically out in the world. It's worth having that over a bit of inconvenience that you can solve by talking to people and grouping up.
---
&gt; Azerite? It's a flawed system that wasn't fleshed out, it's not a bad system
---
Azerite is meh, it's faaaaar from my main issue with the game. It's absolutely something I could live with.
---
&gt; Other than Azerite I really don't know how BFA is any different from Legion.
---
Legion was a dirty cumstain of an expansion filled with RNG, dodgy scaling, ruined PvP and stupid forced importance on your character so not being too different to it is a bad thing. BFA is just like Legion but more boring with less content.
---
There's a reason so many people quit after BFA, it's a bad expansion. Possibly the *worst*, maybe, either way it's down there with WoD.
---
If you want somebody rational and coolheaded to explain why BFA sucks dick, then read this if you're bored and have some spare time since it's long as all fuck.
---
Horrible names for an rp server
---
Just git gud
---
GSA at a small town hotel, not much work to do in general 🤷‍♀️
---
Yeah, but why? I’m gay and have never once considered a LGBT WoW server lol
---
Mage rotation isnt as boring as people make it out to be. When leveling, it's even more dynamic.
---
Of course there's none of that. You'd have to be special to even consider worrying about a token shop in classic...
---
SKELETONS!
---
So? 
---
Also whenever exciting things happen on the stream you can hear it, and you can look over and see whatever going on.
---
And fuck me... with my complaining
---
I highly recommend the MadSeasonShow youtube channel for WoW classic information! Plus they're well made.
---
&gt;It is my belief
---
&gt;It has nothing to do with "me".
---
In your original post, you end asking people what their opinion is regarding these addons. You then proceed to shut down everyone who expresses an opinion different from yours.
---
Multiple people, including me, expressed different reasons to keep these around, but you keep rehashing the same thing over and over, saying it "trivializes" the content. My opinion is that 
---
1- It doesnt, the content is trivial with or without addons like these. The fight are just not that hard, especially with the knowledge everyone is coming in Vanilla with.
---
2- Doesnt at all impact your player experience. If you're unhappy with your guild forcing you to use it, should choose a different guild that will not be using it. If you're jealous of people killing content faster then you and getting more loot, then you're just jealous and your issue is beyond that of BigWigs, DBM and the likes.
---
Destromath had a druid named Highwinds, who would troll trade and general chat with idiotic anti-Obama political commentary, and MRA "Girls Don't Play WoW" memes.  
---
After roughly 2/3 of the Horde side /ignored him, and he got flamed on the forums, he faction changed. Less than a year later, he server changed, because the Alliance on Destro got sick of him, too.
---
God, I miss that shit.
---
Thanks for easing my worries lol
---
People are saying a LFG tool by Blizzard existed at that point. It listed people wanting to do x or y dungeon and then you could whisper them. Nothing wrong with that in classic.
---
Just because you’re on an RP server does not mean you RP, just gotta respect the people who do and go about your business
---
Yep. There are like 6 or however many spawns, each one will have a few folk on it. They will be waiting for the roughly 15 minute spawns, will kill and skin the devil saur and then go afk/watching Netflix until the next spawn. Go down there and roll through man.
---
It's the best-in-slot main-hand weapon for hunters.
---
The rewards are worth more than the cost. You have to run to SW and Darkshire for the "messenger to" quests and for the Defias Brtoherhood chain, you also have to go to Goldhshire for the shoes that start the quests to get black whelp skins. Combine them.
---
It's probably a bad idea to use weakauras for so much stuff...
---
Weakauras are not a light-weight way of displaying info, and classic will not have multi-threading.
---
Why are you not reading the topics already discussing this to find out?
---
Only vanilla CE items yeah. No tcgs.: c
---
Too low crit chance and MC/BWL bosses are too cleavy and too bursty. Seal fate is good for long sustained fights where you have critcapped.
---
This shit sucks, why is this on the front page?
---
It's just too bad to get the upright zandalari trolls you need to get to max level, reach exalted with zandalari empire, and have to do this campaign quest chain.
---
Whereas any ol' orc can go to the barber shop and fix their posture
---
Shadow or dead? I don't get it. 2.5/10

https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw - This is the official Warrior Discord for Classic. They have their own leveling FAQ which contains a thorough and long explanation about the different leveling specs, I'd recommend reading through this list.
---
Most if not all of their choices have an explanation which should help you understand why they picked certain talents/weapons/races /abilities etc
---
Aren't I going to be mana tapping and sitting safely behind my steel wall of a warrior while we kill things? Also will I not be getting less killing blows with drainsoul with another person attacking it?
---
https://discord.gg/9W3NrJy Mograine Discord Server just launched

---
I played on ED through legion and it for sure is or at least was super toxic.
---
Do shadow priest really do well against rogues?
---
Haha! That’s so sad...that I do it daily :(
---
Can someone explain to me how this add on is so horrible? It’s not grouping you with random people cross realm, and teleporting you to the dungeon. You’re still playing and communicating  with people on your server.
---
All it seems to do is not make you spam LFG/LFM in the LFG channel.
---
I love you, hahaha
---
Never saw the draw of barrens chat. Stuck to guild chat, world defense and trade chat.
---
Hunter has the highest skill ceiling when it comes to their rotation in PvE for whatever that's worth.
---
You the immersive type or just stick to guild chat?
---
Your experience is really not going to deviate much from the standard guides. You can use context clues to figure out the rest.
---
"Hello"
---
Part of that respect is your name which everyone else will see.
---
Anyone have a good cheat sheet like this for priest leveling?  Image or product to buy, I don't care!
---
My fucking ears!
---
At first they were only for specific realms but it opened to all realms shortly after.
---
Wait so will there be voice chat in classic?
---
Anything someone else can make for you is better and cheaper than leveling it up yourself.
---
Uhhhh TIL
---
Last time my WoW subscription was active was during vanilla. I never even tried TBC. But classic got me interested in the game again.
---
gandling is a shite name though
---
I actually enjoy it. I don't see a lot of toxicity, I do see a lot of people who convey their desires in a respectable manner. Keeps Blizzard constantly aware of how the community feels and what it wants.
---
I thought about looking at retail.
---
But you have to buy BfA so forget that.
---
Don't forget Sharding, because people couldn't understand that Layering was different. Add in Spell Batching, Melee Leeway, and no "old" AV.
---
That's Mr potato-realistic
---
&gt; Arms or Fury?
---
Don't matter. They feel the same, they play the same, they perform the same.
---
Arms have "flat benefits", like increase 2Handed weapon damage by 5% at all times.
---
While Fury have "random benefits", like you have +5% chance to crit, when you crit you get good stuff. When you don't crit you get nothing.
---
&gt; 2H or DW?
---
2H.
---
The way DW is balanced in the guy is that it has a high chance to miss. People need gear with +Hit chance to be able to DW properly.
---
There's no +Hit low level gear. So you will be missing ALOT if you DW.

---
&gt; Does enrage /sit even work in Classic? 
---
Nope.
---
In private servers you /sit, get critted by mobs and this activates Enrage.
---
In classic you /sit, you still get crit, but it won't activate Enrage.
---
&gt; Does it even matter what I choose?
---
For leveling not really.
---
Stuck with the game of thrones poster too, that's true commitment folks.
---
Yeah, pretty sure it was in D2 and WC3, way before WoW ever even launched.
---
I remember there was a post that got pretty decent upvotes saying (paraphrased) "Please don't let this sub become r/wow", meaning don't let it devolve into memes, shitposts, art, etc but you're fooling yourself if you think that won't happen lol. It's already begun.
---
Can you explain each step in the code? Genuinely curious. Some stuff is obvious, but things like TeM and GetTime()-# I'm interested in learning what they are.
---
Well it's free with your retail sub, so try it and if you hate it, don't play.

Vanilla came out in 2004, by October 2006 TBC was in full Beta and a couple of months from releesee.
---
I didn't look at the addon link but it's possible it was created for TBC or right at the end of Vanilla. I played hard core all the way through vanilla and never heard of any LFG addon.
---
That's infinitely worse, because it's not sortable! You're ruining machine readability by requiring parsing strings to determine months, which is subject to computing time, and errors.
---
It also introduces confusion when we already have an acceptable standard that works worldwide. Does your format translate nicely to Farsi?
---
just picked Tyrande :)

All PvE content of a PvP server is essentially the same as PvE content on a PvE server. You wont find an answer because it doesn't exist.

Not taking off work or anything, but I'll be using all of my free time on Classic for the next week or so. I make sure to hydrate, get up and walk around once every hour, and go to sleep on time. :)
---
I actually don't like the addon, but a lot of people just don't understand what it does. As I said in another comment, if people is going to complain about something, it should be because they understand what that does.
---
At the same time, if you are going to defend the addon, it should be because you like what this addon does.
---
In the same way people shouldn't say "this is wotlk lfg" because it is not crossrealm and it doesn't teleport you to the raid, other people should stop saying that this addon is just a chat parse
---
Blizzard has blueposted that they're going to remove its functionality to keep the game in its intended state.
---
Seriously this subreddit has let what would be a niche addon with not enough users to support it blow up into an addon now the entire community knows about...
---
40 so much worse.
---
Mount and as many skills.
---
I envy you people that have already narrowed down your class choice. I still can't decide on anything.

The guides seem to suggest that Mage is better unless you really want the rogue stealth playstyle.
---
THREE FUCKING DAYS! WOOOOOOOOOOO
---
No, 26th. 27th for rest of the world
---
Well at least for using light theme
---
Yup.
---
&gt; This addon only uses the api that's available via blizzard.
---
I never claimed otherwise. Not sure why you would bring that up.
---
&gt; When looking for people it will periodically write in a public channel of your choice to make people without the Addon aware of the group.
---
What the description for the addon says and what it actually does seem to be two different things. The video I linked to in my first comment clearly shows there being an option that lets you disable "broadcasting dungeon group in chat".
---
&gt; I hope you now stop spreading misinformation.
---
I'm not spreading misinformation. But I got to say, being hung up on the distinction of the addon not using public chat channels and instead it using public channels that are hidden feels pretty disingenuous to me.
---
60 in 2 weeks huh?
---
All subreddit mods are unpaid, other subs have much more consistent rule enforcement.
---
Makes sense. They don't even know what low effort or constantly reposted means so the concept of doxxing is probably above them.
---
Yes because micro transactions like realm transfer definently existed in vanilla lmaoooo
---
1) You don't need the addon to get invited to a group where t he leader has the addon, all this addon really does is spam LFG chat periodically and organizes the replies in a ui showing you the classes of the people that responded. 2)auto invite is getting removed AND even if it weren't, nobody in their right minds would be auto inviting people, that's nonsense. This whole thing is just a massive overreaction from bored people waiting for classic to launch.
---
T R E A S O N
---
LFR MC would actually be hilarious. You queue as a dps into a 15hr queue time to get into a raid designed for 15 people to not know how to play (I believe it was preach who said that in legacy of vanilla iirc) scaled down. LFR MC could probably be done by 8 people.
---
There's an update.
---
I think faction imbalance might be an advantage for PVE raiders long-term. More dungeon groups constantly forming, abundance of players to recruit/fill in raids, will still be able to PVP in BGs when they're out.
---
Good choice!
---
If someone moved from east to west coast or vice versa I would definitely want to be able to switch servers for time zone issues. If your normal raid time was an 8pm start that could get shifted to 11pm or 5pm depending on the move. It could basically break the game for you.
---
`SendChatMessage("Zag zag", "CHANNEL", nil, 2)` worked in 1.12. And  SendAddonMessage can only send to party/raid/guild/whisper just like you described in retail and in 1.13.
---
I have seen exactly zero people do this.
---
Citations please.
---
They did, but decursive and grid(was that the name?) were so good it was pointless using them.
---
restart battle.net
---
Banana gets me everytime!
---
Thank you so much for the tip!
---
Hello, you've reached Arnold's pizza shop.
---
It means you need to update usually through the launcher but there might be a small patch coming soon if it’s not out yet. I saw that during beta
---
I guess all the bootlicking forum posters from back in the day were totally right when saying there just “isn’t enough demand to justify legacy servers”.
---
&gt; at least 24 hours 
---
That's cute.
---
What are you looking to do with this build? I hope it's PvE related, but if it is, you're going to be suffering a lot from skipping Precision. How are you planning on making up for that lack of hit?
---
Wait 2 days and it'll be leaked just like Hakurai's guide(pm for link xd)
---
I just broke into a cold sweat
---
Hahahah
---
It's a moot comparison. No one would be up in arms about Joana if he also released an in game app guide, like he had said he was going to a while ago and charged money for it... Or maybe people would be laughing at zygor if they had released the guide for free and tried to put it behind a paywall later. Zygor has a much more in depth guide with a plug in app that walks you through each step, along with *far* updated paths compared to Joana's. It was initially going to cost $8/mo, already more than Joana's, and no one cared because it's a totally different situation.
---
If Joana had never made his guide free, then no one would complain either. People just think it's a stupid idea to try to put a once free guide behind a paywall when you can literally just use wayback machine to still view the free version; so it's still free even without resorting to piracy. It's just lost traffic and a missed opportunity on his part to monetize in more modern ways.
---
I've been debating holy paladin as well.  But knowing what is expected of a class is important going into classic.
---
Not taking free days, but definitely committing some time in the evenings to play. And weekends? Oh boy, at weekend, we grind!
---
You cannot make 25-50 gold an hour this way. This is complete bullshit. Go back to your private servers with this garbage.
---
You can also try to consider the fact that alliance characters can’t make horde characters. So your logic is pretty flawed. Then again I don’t think logic works if you really think this should be allowed. It’s a pvp server where the 2 sides are at war. Manipulating the purpose of factions ok maybe, but using addons that are borderline cheating yeah ok...
---
That's when it releases!
---
Um..eh...I prefer to quest in Kalimdor over Eastern Kingdoms as Alliance
---
I think I read somewhere that brewfest was tbc content. Don't qoute me on that though.
---
You're right. I'm installing it now. Thanks.
---
I know I’m swinging a big dick weapon in arms spec. If you’re rolling on a PvP server I believe the added utility it brings is invaluable. On PvE you can make a solid claim for either spec. It seems sit doesn’t proc enrage and hamstring kiting is harder to get just right because of melee leeway.
---
&gt;the game has completely free chat typing
---
&gt;they are worried about skeleton messages
---
Maybe they should also go the path of Toontown and implement the SpeedChat function instead of open text chat. Actually scratch that, I really don't want to give them any genuine ideas.
---
Looks like launch week unless you are feeding the whole guild.
---
Yeah that made me laugh
---
/r/lounge/ mods are paid
---
Yup, 5pm Central
---
I just tried a lvl 15 shaman of mine with dungeon finder. It was full aoe and cleared in 10-15 minutes. I was the healer and half the time I would shoot free lightning bolts, and the outer hair cast heals. I don't think I went under 80% mana and no one had to test out drink.
---
I can't wait to get some real challenges again.
---
i worry because its blizzard we are talking about 
---
bfa is just a mount/token and services shop
---
Nightelf has the worst priest only spells but shadowmeld mind control sounds like it might be worth it
---
what is the point of responding to my comment if you're gonna ignore everything I wrote
---
&gt; I think most people are aware of how it will practically work.
---
The amount of people comparing this to Call to Arms makes me doubt the veracity of that claim.
---
Sorry you must suck if you need a guide for this game.
---
That's so similar to a trollface now that I see it up close!
---
Okay, *the majority of* subreddit mods are unpaid. My point still stands.
---
&gt; immersive epicness of raid encounters
---
MC bosses had literally one or two mechanics. Even BWL bosses were largely very simple. You are DRASTICALLY overestimating just how complex vanilla bosses were compared to retail.
---
Definitely a small minority, but we will kill it anyway.
---
So much .. played a mage last time i was on a pserver and oh my any that saw me was instantly on a mission to ruin my day

Definitely. Same reason I’ve only ever played burst mages in League. I love seeing huge damage and big numbers. Mage it is I think.
---
Transfers were a part of Vanilla. I'm not sure about race changes, but transfers were definitely a part.
---
The guy basically just wrote that he'll pass it along.
---
Blizz, pls block this addon!
---
I hope classic doesn't kill retail, I plan to still farm retail gold to pay for my sub because I really don't want to pay $16 a month to play classic all over again.
---
People will still make pug groups for endgame stuff. I wouldn't worry about that too much.
---
I am so fucking excited for this I literally haven't felt this excited for something in so long. And I have friends and coworkers so damn excited too like holy fuck we just keep feeding on each others excitement and we've done nothing but talk about classic and watch videos about classic then talk about videos that talk about classic then we find out stuff from videos giving random tips in classic and what professions we're going and how we're gonna level together. I even have a friend who has never played classic just recent retail and asked me what sheep was when I used it in a dungeon sense. New players dont even know about sheep cause we just aoe stuff down in dungeons on retail.
---
I'm gonna be so pissed if I die before monday.
---
&gt;  The only two problems with bfa are azerite and class design
---
-Non-existent realm communities because of too much phasing
---
-World PvP is instanced, splitting communities further
---
-Too many difficulties for raids with big item level gaps between them inflating numbers again which will need to be fixed by ANOTHER stat squish
---
-Titanforging means you can get a piece of gear you wanted and yet *still* be disappointed
---
-No reforging and no primary stat on rings means that if you get the wrong ring from a Mythic raid, it's actually worse than an LFR ring with good secondary stats
---
-Buy the game, pay a subscription and yet there are still micro-transactions for in-game items. This obviously wasn't introduced in BFA but it's still around so it counts as an issue for the current expansion
---
-Leveling is the most boring it has ever been while also being [so nonsensical that it's actually funny](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EJ6fgnpCIZWL8Z2ajdk2CjcuvYKLHIjBx-V1lBAe4hCTWGnKsx-60yDLxN7Qb8sv2V5fAc8K1UoOw_hVQ-tETGRSAYcevhIOr2xwW4V2VdvS7DoykueHaILw2R81MotJ8RhzwVU). Having the mobs scale with you as your heirloom gear scales ruins any sense of progression within zones, which is annoying. You get pretty much nothing from ~85 to 120 so leveling becomes very unrewarding from that point
---
-No fucking PvP vendors, why Blizz, every PvPer wants them back
---
What the fuck..?
---
You seem upset.
---
I think mage is the one after reading these comments. Thanks for your input and happy cake day.
---
These are getting to be real low effort.
---
Why isn't incendius on the realm list on my client? Anyone know?
---
Attic man cave is best man cave.
---
"Best game in the world" that is again just an opinion of yours. League of legends had a much higher population worldwide(12mil wow subs peak vs 67mil monthly active league of legends peak), even Fortnite is way more popular in the west than WoW ever was. I have also been playing since BC, so yeah I did play in the "golden era" (Legion was by far the best expac IMO lol). So let me get this straight, because YOU dont like the direction of Wow (whether I agree or disagree with you here is irrelevant), even though WoW is still the most popular MMO, Wow is unsuccessful and failing. Wow man how about you actually try to prove to me that its failing other than giving me your worthless opinion for once or better yet you can just stop commenting as youre adding nothing to the original topic. :)
---
Extremely chaotic but I like it
---
Call to Arms is an addon to find AV premades. Stop pushing the agenda that it’s a global LFG addon. Shit gets tiring.
---
I probably would have if it wasn’t a 60 gig download
---
If anything, this addon will help socialize, as you won't miss that party going into dungeon you want. Because when thousands of players from dozens of layers will start spamming all the dungeons, LFG channel will be unreadable.
---
[Haha you're so original! ](https://i.imgur.com/tUztdB0.jpg)

Vanilla I played mage, so at first it was undead mage.. but duskwood is my favorite zone so it switched to dwarf priest.. but then back to undead but warlock for something new.. then I thought a gnome might be cool.. i still have no idea.

It might be the only warning you get that the Devilsaur Mafia wired up a bomb to your mount.

Are you really going to be that pathetic? Any guild doing this is a guild I dont want to be apart of
---
No one does this now because it doesn’t matter cause everything dies so fast. I know just from limited time in stress tests you couldn’t get around Mulgore without Mark of the Wild being put on you. It was great. I can’t wait for Crossroads and all those delicious buffs nom nom nom!
---
Getting enough for a full raid with the queue times, competition and likely server crashes, I think people are deluded if they're aiming for Rag week 1.
---
The archived copy of CTA I downloaded earlier (dated 10/2006) definitely had autoinvite functionality, and labeled as such. I had to head out before doing a full tear down of the code so I don’t know exactly under what conditions it ran yet. Either way, the API functionality to do so was in 1.x and the calls to it were there.
---
And even if it was only used in rare cases or few used that feature, I definitely know people snap-invited in response to whispers. Sometimes the content is trivial and you’re just grinding for a drop; sometimes you’ll just take what you can get. Not every group was handcrafted with a background check. I know because I wasn’t good enough for the standards bandied about here and on the forum and I still got invites where there was hardly time for them to slam /who before I got the /invite.
---
And we still talked before and during the dungeon. I got help learning how to run to these places I’d never seen, and I got taught what spells to kick. I saw players worse than I, who got carried because it just wasn’t worth kicking them and waiting for a replacement to run all the way from Org.
---
And I did get removed from the odd group when we met up at the bank and they saw I’d outfitted myself with the stupidest greens and that was a dealbreaker at level 30. So I wrote their names down and stopped responding to their listings. And I friended people I had fun with, because it was always worth pinging them before hitting chat.
---
The problem with the Retail LFD system isn’t a dialog box or even random matchmaking. It’s specifically the removal of any reason to get to know your teammates *once the group has formed*. You have no incentive to build a reputation with or assist four people from other servers, no downtime to chat when everyone warps right in, and no incentive not to kick someone at the first mistake when there’s little to no downtime before you can pull again. That goes out the window when everyone on the server learns you don’t take advice well or are an asshole to people less experienced than you.
---
I don’t see myself using this autoinvite feature but you know what this hubbub has made me realize? My typical LFG practice was to post and then accept the first people that came my way, because it’s easier to trust that people know whether they’re ready for a dungeon and then verify in /p, than prescreening everybody in an interwoven web of whispers that made the reply key useless. Oh, and hoping I wasn’t missing someone else posting for the same dungeon in chat, which scrolls by quickly even when whispers aren’t taking my attention. If I’m going to grab first comers anyway, why not speed that up?
---
And since the DPS spots filled quickly, it was easy to ask /p whether they had any friends online who could tank or heal. Oh and if someone had a question I couldn’t answer, my other new teammates often did. And all with the dumbest possible “auto” invitation algorithm one could write.
---
Why is the automation a problem?
---
Is that an ek pump/res I spy?
---
I will do that and hopefully some people won't be as toxic about it, I appreciate the tips!
---
How about guild leaders and officers lead by example and not be jerks.
---
Lmfap brooo lions blood potion!
---
Addons are a bit of a mess right now. There hasn't been a whole lot of time for developers to verify that their addon works 100% and so the files posted are mostly best effort without being able to test.  
---
Addons on curse that have a version for classic, like [Bartender](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4),  will have  two files on the right side of the screen under the heading Recent Files. You should see one for WoW named 4.8.4 and one under the heading WoW Classic  named 4.8.4-classic.  Both the Battle for Azeroth version and the Classic version share the same addon page.  If you just click download or install at the top you will get the Battle for Azeroth version.
---
Yeah but a level 5 bank alt can disenchant everything soooo...
---
2 hours after launch:
---
"LF lvl40+ to carry me several runs through Deadmines! Paying 5s per run!"
---
You can download from wowinterface and it will keep them up to date, as long as that addon is also hosted on curseforge
---
I haven't seen that image in probably 10 years now... Wow.

To be fair, if you're able to get your hands on a Nightfall 2H Axe, you'll be able to tank almost all of the dungeon content without any issues. It's the raids where you should definitely have a shield and a main-hand. You can definitely still do the 2-hand thing as an off-tank in raids as long as you keep a decent shield and main-hand in your bags just in case.

There is a rythem to shadow priest grinding that I just find hypnotic at times. With spirit tap boating your spirit immensely after killing blows it just does flows so smoothly. Start with mind blast, then dot it, then mind flay, they just wand it to death when you reach it. 
---
The 5 second rule for spirit is the name of the game. You should be getting it right when the mob dies, then your spirit gets steroids. There is no downtime whatsoever and your spells hit very hard.
---
Hmm, thats strange, it opens for me. I guess ill re-upload everything into a new gallery, too many people keep mentioning issues
---
Yeah generally the person screaming about how everyone sucks but them is the one causing the problems.
---
You are not the demographics, players who haven't subbed yet are.
---
And for pve servers it's opposite
---
They could just take the best parts of TBC and fit them into Classic+. Karazhan comes to mind and (at least the first dungeon) from caverns of time, improved talent trees. I would even be fine with heroics. But no flying mounts and no insular expansion-land that makes Azeroth obsolete. The game is called World of Warcraft and as the developers said in a recent video the world is the main "character" of WoW. Starting with TBC they started writing the main character out of the story.
---
Thanks. I completely forgot about the global cooldown.

Tbf I don’t think this is clever lol most gaming subs I’m part of do it when something’s approaching with even a slight amount of hype.
---
How about, and this is really really crazy. Actually insane. Mind boggling. I don't think you're ready for this one...
---
Let people do what they want. At this point I think the people not using the addon and bitching CONSTANTLY about it are worse than the people who use the addon (and I had no strong opinion either way, if people want to use addons let them. If people don't want to use addons, let them.)
---
Only to play 111-120. A sub gets you everything before that.
---
In the Old days dps would compete who would be the first to take aggro from you and it could be very frustrating if you where not a good tank. Current times people and yourself will have threat meter so you all have allot more controll and raid leaders won't accept people doing that anymore. 
---
It can be stressfull and you have the toughest job most of the time that requires constant attention and dedication while others have allot more time to snooze on the job. My advice would be is to enjoy the pressure, responsibility and leadership while constantly having the motivation to do it again and better. Create your own style on what fits you and understand you are playing with people so they won't always be kind to you. Some might start pulling if you are to slow or complain and play a blame game ect. 
---
Tanking can be very rewarding and tought me allot on how to work with others. I usually asign tasks to my dps and share the responsibility. Make the mage polymorph your marked targets and the hunter pull targets to you. You can ofcourse use your own gun or bow, but it allows him to practice and retain his attention span as traditionally this is low with hunters. As a tank you should know all the classes and what they bring to the team, while having some knowledge of the dungeon you plan on doing.
---
Also ALWAYS WATCH the mana bar of the healer. That is your health bar. 
---
Good luck!
---
On the leveling assessment: https://medium.com/@ronkuby/single-target-mage-leveling-824d4d10d88
---
&gt; could not communicate between addons
---
Yes they could, they used "hidden" chat channels, thats how every old threat meter synced up back then, as long as addons can read/write to chat they can send data between eachother.  
---
And there is limits to this (same limits apply to the current LFG addon).
---
Agreed. Thankfully most of them are on herod so I won't have to deal with that noise
---
2H Fury is a better leveling build than Arms until level 40. Post-40, it's really a matter of how good your gear is and how you want to level. If you're geared to the hilt and loaded up on mage food, go ahead and do the Arms thing (pool rage against one mob, then cleave down two mobs with an SS/WW/Cleave/MS rotation). If not, you're better off killing mobs one at a time as Fury. 
---
I also think Fury is a better solo PvP build against non-healers because of Deathwish and Improved Intercept, but that's another matter entirely.
---
This thread should provide you good sources of information
---
So you expect people without the add-on to be able to read a chat that has hundreds of messages posted every minute by an add on?
---
It's not humanly readable even if it's accessible.
---
Wait really? how did you schduel this and how much did it cost?
---
I wanna do this for some things.

Typical, look at all that damage before the tank is even there.

Yeah but keep in mind since the AMA all the databases are changing the phase on the loot tables. what i have on there is pre AMA haha so subject to change now

It's very weird to watch them reminisce about how they used to care / be good at design. Also, nobody really cares about what the devs were thinking.

Oh my god. That's great!
---
Oh there is no set rotations? Sorry pretty new to WoW in general! I appreciate the heads up though, I'm probably more worried about 5 man tanking than actual raid tanking, was just worried about getting a raid spot even if I was to join a guild.

I think it's important to set up expectations when playing a druid because it is a hard class to master.  But I'm maining a druid because you will be doing everything at some point at your career and I can't wait to see what tricks I can come up with.  If you love a challenge and variety, druids can't be beat.
---
From everything we've seen so far, pservers are harder than classic will be.
---
Nobody did. Nobody even knew they existed.
---
A website or discord might pop up. But the vast majority of players will not go there. The hurdle of leaving the game is enough to stop most from using other chat channels and services.
---
I guess maybe the mods are letting people get it all out up until launch then will have a dedicated day for memes and art sharing (wishful thinking). I think the wow sub had that actually but then somewhere down the line they got rid of the restrictions. I’m guessing because they noticed the sub’s activity dropped dramatically lol. Memes keep subs alive so yea just gotta deal with it

oQueue existed, because there was demand for cross-server LFR tool and game did not have one. Developers were not opposed to oQueue (they did not like that this addon caused unexpected load on whispers subsystem, so they did something to prevent that) and implemented it in the game after some time. If Blizzard will publicly state that LFG tool is bad and will try to limit API to prevent existing addons to work, that would be a different situation.
---
I've never been more excited for a game in my life. I seriously cannot wait. It's actually scaring me.

Well, a lot of guilds recruit tanks in house. Have one of their DPS switch to tank for the guild and stuff. So, raiding might be hard to find a spot.
---
Dungeons you'll have no issue getting into. It's all up to you though. I'm sure with enough effort you'll find a guild who needs to fill a tank spot or something. There's bound to be one out there, maybe someone'll even post here asking if you're looking for a guild.

Not gonna lie, tanking in vanilla is very stressful, cos you are always stressed about losing the threat and making enough of it on every mob you tank.(compared to retail). aswell as its hard to tank multiple mobs and you need to switch targets. 
---
On top of that your abilities like taunt and others can miss/resist, so you can fully rely on them, you need to be constantly attentive, and react to the situation. and you can never be totaly sure.
---
if you are looking for chill stress free role, vanilla tank is definitely the last choice for that.
---
so where is the no changes crowd now ? first you ree for no changes, except now something comes up you dont like, so changes good
---
repeat after me
---
CLASSIC FANS ARE PATHETIC
---
&gt; Not everyone is a troll, asshole, etc.
---
Thats not what I said. Very few are trolls, but *a lot* of people will feed the trolls. If you just block trolls, chat still looks horrible due to all the people responding.
---
Lol that warrior isn't doing shit. Just peeping the dragon 👀
---
I'm not referring to Glider for the record. There were addons which would could handle traveling, and others for combat. That's the kind of stuff the Blizzcon guy above was presumably referencing. Some of that was famously broken (AutoTraveler comes to mind), but even in 1.12 the API was much more liberal than it is today. I haven't used the notorious addon everyone's talking about, but judging by videos essentially recreating modern group finder, nothing *to my knowledge* existed like that in vanilla. Even if aspects of it were in other addons, or possible through the API.
---
Since Blizzard has already set a precedent in disallowing certain addons that break the spirit of the game, despite the fact that it's anachronistic to 1.12 (popular addons like decursive or healbot for ex.), I'm inclined to say that they should follow through with that policy here. But that said, who draws the line for what is "within the spirit of the game"? Are enemy cast bar addons against the "spirit" since they weren't in vanilla? I sure as hell don't know.
---
Yeah ist awesome ❤️ ure not regretting it. 👌🏻
---
why?
---
Where have you been the past 3 years? Games have been getting flack constantly for misrepresenting their products with skins, loot boxes, microtransactions etc.
---
Oh, that's actually a really good point. I wonder if that is the actual reason.
---
gawd no, a thousand times no
---
This is too meta lol
---
Even if it's once a minute, if five hundred people on a realm uses it, it would be 500 messages a minute. 
---
The major point and difference is that it would make the inconvenience of having to replace a member that might be bad irrelevant. Which would lead to people kicking and replacing instead of trying to work out the issues.
---
Most friends in wow were made in Dungeons and group quests by working together to overcome hard encounters.
---
Not by making it easy to replace someone for being "shit".
---
The first 3 text bullet points, yes. Changing player name colors I'll believe when I see it, there's no API for stuff like that.
---
The text in the pictures is where things get wacky. Claims that this add-on can track a guild's lifetime damage, healing, skills, talents, etc. There's no API for that stuff in Classic (or at all for some of it). Damage meters work by parsing the combat log, so unless this group is going to secretly follow every single player of a guild around to read theirs, including in enemy cities and instances mind you, it is just not possible. Inspecting people in Classic doesn't show you their talents, wasn't in the game til later, so how is it going to manage that? I mean forget polling the talent choices of an entire guild remotely (lol), just tell me how you're going to see the talents of someone standing right next to you. Again, they would need to somehow fool the entire server into installing their addon and sending all this data via chat channels.
---
I had that guide. Wish I still did. I looked for it on amazon the other day, couldn’t find it
---
You seem uneducated on the topic at hand.
---
You see this all the time on p servers. The truth has always been that the player base is smarter and you are guaranteed to not have the same experience as you did back 15 years ago. Sorry to be the bringer of bad news; shoot the messenger of you want.
---
I'm working in advertising right now and only one person here seems to play video games, and he plays console only :(.

he didn't say he "knew", he said it "appeared to be" a certain way.
---
And if you'd read the same stuff I have, you might think it appeared that way as well.
---
and i still have no idea why we don't even get an option to use new models.. i'm here for vanilla gameplay not vanilla looks
---
It's kinda of a pain in the ass that one of the guys I'll be playing with is playing priest tbh. I'd happily play resto but I'm being forced to pick a dps class/spec. They all think I'm going to be playing mage currently but honestly, it feels wrong for me to play dps. Like I said I've always played support. We already have a warrior tank, hunter and priest. So I guess it makes sense for me to play lock or mage. *Sigh*
---
Was going to downvote you without even bothering to read the post.
---
That's how much transmog is bad.
---
Keep that garbage for people that play Barbie WoW.
---
Like I said, addons (including **mine**) would use SendChatMessage instead of SendAddonMessage back then anyway, it doesn't change much things, except hiding the channel from the chat frame.
---
One group member is deadset on Undead Warlock.
---
Other friend wants to play Mage (probably Undead?)
---
I'm open to whatever, but it probably should be Undead something since we want to level together.
---
Few questions...
---
1. Would Undead Priest be too cloth heavy for our 3 man group? 
---
2. If I chose Shaman or Druid for a leather healer, would I be able to level with them in the Undead area? Or would we have to wait until later to meet up? Any suggestions for which race?
---
Omg when i seen this i suddenly remembered it after so long, the nostalgia is real
---
I would think so, but is traffic all they're looking at? I know they look for scripts/botting stuff, but does an RDP program pop on that radar at all?
---
This is a single-target build
---
High Warlord Kate Moss
---
Dyes to change color schemes, yes. Mogs, no.
---
Nope. That feeling of spotting someone or sporting yourself some awesome gear is completely killed with transmog
---
I really liked the updated models, however for the purity of the experience im happy they've been left out.
---
&gt;that's why some people use air plaines

---
That's how it is! Lok'tar ogar

This is my primary reason for hating it.
---
You can’t see how good someone’s gear is simply by looking at them.
---
You expected... something else? This _is_ the Classic WoW subreddit.
---
The group finder the above poster is talking about was added in wrath.  There wasn't a feature that made the group for you and then teleported you to the instance in TBC.
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/culo45/the_true_reason_to_play_the_best_class/). 
---
If my buddy was going mage I would 100% try this out just to see how it went.  I doubt it would be as good even with mage water, but it would be fun and you might find some interesting stuff about balance that gets overlooked.
---
Most likely this. People love to jump to the worst possible conclusion, when it's typically just the most mundane one instead.
---
Yeah, just wanted to keep things correct.
---
My slave will get it when I need to poop
---
well that is a good excuse until level 2.
---
If it can't be mage it's either hunter if you like dps roles or druid if you feel like you can enjoy the hybrid playstyle.
---
Hunter has the advantage of having a high skill ceiling in PvP and PvE raiding as opposed to Frost mage which is literally one button spam if that helps your decision.
---
definitely ruins the game, items become meaningless
---
Yes, and I've re-created them at least twice, with pretty much the same look, lol.
---
Idk if you have any faction or server preferences but I started up an alliance guild on Skeram with a few friends and viewers from streaming (only 10 of us so far) and it’s got both new and old players who just wanna have some fun playing together. You’re welcome to join us!
---
love it. 😂
---
From what I recall that’s what it was mainly used for. AV premades. Never used it myself, so not 100% sure. Nobody in my guild used it either. Or any of my friends. Or any of the random groups I joined. Like I said, not a commonly used thing.
---
Fan and pencil is for people still running Dell Optiplexes. Download AutoHotkey and get a basic script that inputs Spacebar every X seconds/minutes.
---
Whooh was waiting for this!
---
Good think you decided to read the thread.
---
My Reddit karma thanks you.
---
No I out this on my legs while resting in the lounge chair
---
I get where you’re coming from but the details don’t matter to the other people. It wasn’t in classic l, so it doesn’t belong is classic. That’s all. If it makes finding a group any percentage easier or convenient, it’s not classic.
---
Now that's what's going to take time for me is learning what everyone's role is and what they can offer. I guess the part of everyone relying on the MT is what worries me and will probably stress me out but I'm still willing to try everything. Tanking just seems so rewarding and pleasing.
---
This is so pretty. So vibrant. I love this piece!   
---
You are very talented!
---
didnt you want no changes ? addons like these and even more powerful ones existed in classic. So you either keep screeching no changes and are ok with addons like this, or you want changes and then you open the can of worms ;)
---
Now that's not a crossover I've seen in a long time... a long time.
---
Doooooooooooope!
---
Yeah make it all red, for the Horde
---
I had not even considered that it would motivate people to go after certain gear differently. That’s a definite no-thanks for me.

Does this apply to Americans?

Thanks bud ❤️

i may have to unsub when all the retail players start asking for features next week

Agreed. Memes get upvoted like crazy. I now avoid the Hot filter

Hakurai's leveling guide has been converted to a format to use with [Guidelime](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime) by [Shiku](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime_shiku). It has the 1-60 Alliance guide that is intended for human warriors.  The guide is more quest by quest than zone by zone though.
---
Undead, a grave, an abomination, pumpkins, tirisfal, undercity.  Lots of green goo.
---
Otu
---
Doesn't fire synergize with crits, which are hard to get off leveling.
---
you didn't even point out the snow missing from the bush on the wheel. retail noob taking over the sub trying to fit in confirmed...
---
Go horde on Grob.  Seems to be the best server, and alliance are scum.
---
If its the same graphical style as in classic, not only will mages not actually be wearing pants, but their legs will be missing from the feet up
---
How about guild leaders kick people asking them to be dicks to people over a damn addon.
---
Yeah imagine running into a warrior in full t4 with ashbringer all moged to look like a fresh 60 in lvl 48ish to 55 gear and attacking him only for him to 2 shot you.
---
I really don't even prefer to be a LT, but if I had to choose I would definitely rather be an LT than a GM.
---
I'm sure people will try it, curious how blizzard will treat those accounts. Since I'm disabled and home all day I just eat the queue because I know I can stay online for a good time after I get through.

I’ll be consuming adderall exclusively

Mmm we are getting a bit too much full of ourselves... The cringe is strong
---
They've kind of reworked her a bit in BFA so she's a bit more bloodthirsty after Teldrassil was destroyed. She was at her worst in Legion, and I think due to fan complaints they toned down her whole relationship with Malfurion, since that was pretty much her whole character in Legion.
---
Haha, please tell me you're not serious right now? If you buy a 3D game and see artistic renderings of races on a character creator screen, when the exact model of your character is right there, and feel like you've been mislead, you're being a dumbass. There's no two ways about it.
---
And that's where the draft comes in. Really keeps you cool for ragnaros.
---
Nope, you're the only one on planet earth man! You're so unique!
---
well, if you faction swap, you have to choose a new race. Which faction is easier to level?

The way I always do - booze and bad decisions.

Dude we were talking on discord about that guy? Is he gonna play now?!
---
People said hes probably a fat aussie wifebeater now, which is an ugly stereotype imo.
---
I have a couple of times just to smile. I was lucky enough to reserve the original name for my original main way back when I made him as a naive kid just shy of puberty. Can't wait to explore the world again like old times!
---
Here’s to hoping we get a “no retail posts” rule soon enough. I’ve read enough of these to last a lifetime
---
As we stated in the sheet, the raid spec depends on what your fighting. Fire is obviously terrible if your trying to kill something resistant to fire, but its actually the highest dps spec later in the game where your in naxx. (also good luck killing frost resistant stuff with frost spells)
---
Thanks for the unique insight
---
Bipolar
---
Ohhhh wooow I laughed so hard!   
---
Man thank you! Have an awesome weekend!
---
Where have you seen toxicity with Firemaw?
---
The Kobolds in the caves do have high droprates, but they are also needed for a quest which means there will be lots of competition to kill them.
---
You're an annoyingly negative person.
---
Nah none of those buildings match the one in OPs pic.
---
Fortnite will still probably be in “beta” in 15 years.
---
How? 😲
---
Undead probably have the most contentious model.
---
When it comes up on Reddit, half the people complain about the exposed bones, while half really like it. I do find it odd that people who dislike it still roll undead anyway.
---
Honest ones?
---
I’m in the same boat !
---
Then don’t bitch about Joanna’s guide. That is a speed leveling guide dumbass.
---
I myself am basically willing to devote the full extent of the upcoming 3 weeks to classic.  
---
Planning to do a 30hour+ marathon with some friends as soon as servers go live and continue to go full ham for the following weeks after that  
---
24 pack red bull at the ready, catered food or easy to prep meals and lots of water are going to be my best friends in terms of food and drinks.  
---
Cancelled all plans and will be pretty much following the routine of WoW, eat, sleep, repeat.  
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
That depends on how lucky I get with procs 😏
---
NO!
---
In programming there's always a way :)
---
Even though in certain cases, while there's a way, it might not be a feasible one. Banning the use of this addon - i basically can guarantee that this won't be happening.
---
Why? Quite simply because there's no need to. Many people will use it. Many people won't. It's players choice to use it or not. And believe it or not but what this addon does was possible back in vanilla, too. Only thing is: we didn't saw a need for it back then - we actually enjoyed looking for groups.
---
Since you're pretty new to WoW, let me point this out:
---
Warrior is the worst class at leveling. It's not just worst. It's VERY bad at leveling.
---
Coming from today's games, this Heavy Armor wearer, Shield Wielder, class will confuse of because of how much damage you're taking from normal mobs while leveling. And how little damage you're dealing to them.
---
The first time I played Vanilla WoW, I did pick a Warrior. I reached level 6. I was a full health and I tried to kill a level 8 mob in the starting zone.
---
It killed me.
---
I was like *"WTF ? I just started playing. Those are Tutorial mobs..."*
---
That warrior never reached level 7. I switched to something.
---
---------------------------------------
---
Im not trying to scare you. Im letting you know how it is. The things that no one told me back then.
---
[I recommend watching this leveling guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp6sIFmSQK0). It's a little *advanced* but it's how I learned to play the class when I made a new warrior later on.
---
A lot of it is filler to make it look nice.
---
Thanks bud
---
classic streamer retarded bullshit
---
Thanks! I'm glad you found it useful. There's certainly a lot to talk about, but I tried to keep it as concise as possible specifically for that reason.
---
Yea it is less, but the add-on would spam more than a person. People are not automated and are fairly lazy. So they will not regularly repeat a message over and over forever.
---
Then there is the fact that this add on will spam in scenarios where a person would not bother. Because why not, they don't have to do anything so why not let the add-on spam and check for members all the time for stuff yij want to do?
---
For me personally, the only real issue k have with this is the auto inviting etc.
---
I would be fine with it if it was only, and I mean ONLY, for listing groups, like the dungeon finder in tbc were.
---
No auto invite, ko talent inspection etc. So it would be a window with a list of groups, but you still had to discuss and talk and introduce yourself beforehand. 
---
Basically, remove the automation.
---
Why play what you enjoy in a video game when something out there could be *better?*
---
&gt; no one who lives a healthy lifestyle
---
good thing i said
---
&gt;no one who lives a healthy lifestyle...
---
Even if this addon didn’t exist, there isn’t ever going to be an “authentic experience” in Classic. 
---
Even with the gameplay virtually the same, one of the biggest things people always talk about is going to be different.
---
The community playing the game. 
---
The player base now is going to be very different than it was 15 years ago. 
---
If this addon is widespread, it’s because the people playing the game want it to be. Because now there are going to be way more people familiar with addons than there were during vanilla.
---
Wait what I didn’t even realise they changed it. That looks awful.
---
I just pee in my pants. No time to waste. 😂
---
Do you have optimism that many guilds will not be using it? I’ve seen you and another person say this, but boy am I skeptical. I hope so too but I don’t share that optimism.
---
Yes, I’m that cynical.
---
Zygor is $8/mo subscription.

since you already got very good answers here, im just gonna link you this [Prot Warrior Guide](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=16057) . Its one of the best ive read and just reading and understanding it will put you ahead of a lot of tanks. Enjoy! Classic war is one of the best choices you can make :)
---
I wouldn't want transmog, but I wouldn't be against 'hide shoulders'.
---
I leveled 2 mages before early stuff got overhauled and I'm convinced fire is the fastest spec.  There's a lot of good low level +fire damage gear.
---
oH nO, nOt tHe SjWs
---
&gt; Even if aspects of it were in other addons, or possible through the API.
---
but this is the point im making. the features all existed in other addons. 
---
CTA was a group finding addon.
---
addons that allowed automating invites to a group existed. (raid invite addons for example)
---
addons that automated sending messages to chat existed (kick callers for example)
---
Addons talking to addons existed (Dps meters with Sync functions come to mind, or Group calanders)
---
the fact that all these features were not put into one addon doesnt matter. all the facets existed in seperate addons, and we shouldnt "break" an addon for someone having the idea now to put it all togeather. the idea that people arent allowed to innovate on what we used 15 years ago is kind of ludacris. 
---
noone is complaining that Elv and Weakauras are ported to classic, for example.
---
Ele mage is very strong at 60 probably the second most popular build going enough in fire to get blast wave and enough in frost for ice block. Can definitely be viable while leveling although you lose out on world pvp survivability and aoe grinding but can make up for it in single target damage. To clarify I wouldn’t go deep deep fire some of the frost talents are simply too good to pass up. I’ve also found fire mages to put out more dps in 5 man dungeons especially early on when your burst isn’t quite there.
---
You enjoy being a burden to other people?
---
Yes! That was my mine gripe when pandas came out. They're just too damn springy and jiggly and not in a good way either. That's when I knew 100% I was no longer the target audience. Wrath planted the seed of doubt, cata confirmed it, and panda had my plot and stone set aside for me. 
---
Before the animations while not super smooth, gave the characters a sense of solid weight. Now it's like they attached globs of jello pudding into sticks.
---
The a animators should know that just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
---
Say what you will, I love the flavor that the devilsaur mafia adds to any server
---
I would think that's why he listed "Spec must adapt to raid elements (you won't kill Ragnaros with fire)" as one of the cons
---
Did this once, to scared to attempt it again.
---
seems like you're the problem retail has, and classic will have
---
These work for all races and genders!

Never played as well. How many hours long is the campaign?
---
One of the creators of subnautica did a GDC and he spent a good bit emphasizing how much lets plays, specifically Jackseptici(can't remember spelling) influenced the sales of their game.
---
Fuck that...
---
Everyone seems to be moving there and Shazzrah discord is related to this server. I saw a lot of talk there and I don't really like the people and their intentions. I think I'll be rolling Mograine, it is a really cool name and I think many will do the same as me just because of how badass it is
---
Just light a cyno and bridge in 40 smartbombing mages
---
It was posted here on reddit... Some days ago 😉
---
Well, yes, but they took it waaaaay too far in retail. The porting to the dungeon then being able to port in and out. It's just all too much. I'm not as against something that just puts me in a chat with my group and we then all have to haul our asses to and from.
---
I felt like fire was much much faster to lvl than ice if not aoe lvling.  Felt fine in pvp too.  To bad about all the early raid bosses tho.  :(
---
Yikes. Ask your sister-momma for a juice box and take a nap kid.
---
...all...the...day...long.
---
I was also fire for leveling in vanilla to great success, like yourself.
---
The internet echo-chamber has people believing that if you aren’t kiting everything/everyone then you won’t be successful.  They seem to forget that even without PoM &gt; Pyro a fire mage is more than capable of 1 or 2 shotting mobs/players.
---
&gt; a fun project that a couple people start working on for the heck of it.
---
LOL No clue about the history of vanilla WoW's development.
---
Jesus you armchair “historian” revisionists. It was a major corporate push to make an Everquest killer. Lots of money was dumped behind its development and the quarterlies were clear that it would be the next major tent-pole franchise for the company.
---
What the fuck are you on about, mate?
---
Why don't you link the actual thread and not the sub reddit?
---
NOPE!!
---
GTFO
---
Memes should be outright banned.

This basically sums this whole Situation up. Really gonna look forward to the famed classic community -.-

I wish my Druid looked like that in "Cat Form"
---
The human quests up to level 30 are pretty awesome. Especially the defias quest chain that ends in the deadmines.
---
A lot of the fun of this game for me was experiencing exploration. Don't spoil yourself with questing addons/guides/looking up loottables. Don't do any min/maxing until you hit 60.
---
Not on Grobbulus ;)
---
There’s also the fact that you get Arcane Intellect and eventually you both get the Moonkin Aura... would definitely be a worthy experiment
---
Not in NA my friend!
---
No retail required man. Just a sub
---
New season of D3 ofc
---
wand spec, spirit tap, whatever, respec to shadow form lvl 40, enjoy gaem
---
The big thing you have to think about here is that DBM only affects the person using it. We've also solved all the bosses already, they aren't new content, even though they are fresh, so the advent of a mod telling you what to do is pretty similar to your raid leader already knowing how the bosses work.
---
The LFG addon could potentially affect other players, and therein lies the rub. The LFG addon, if implemented correctly, would only serve to foster a sense of community, if used incorrectly, it could harm it.
---
Nothing new, just that they added it after community feedback.
---
I remember the best mage i ever played against was frost/fire spec. Can't tell you specifics, but he was death on wheels. His name was Clip, on Sargeras. He was a real bastard
---
Won't matter if they ban it.
---
Succubus is the best to level with because...uh...reasons.
---
I didn't say I was going to use it, friend. No reason to say I fucked anything up, I haven't even played WoW since Cata when LFR was rolled out.
---
Thanks I'll do it. 👍🏻
---
Yep

Don't worry, as a fury warrior you won't have to try very hard at all.

I just had a guildie log in and grab my name as I deleted it. Finally got my toons done the way I wanted them today. I don't trust the dedication of some people here...

---
Literally. Same.
---
Mmm. The content in this sub is starting to age like a fine. Nice oc op
---
is the soda diet? if not that's the big mistake here  
---
2 pizzas a day will get boring and unfulfilling fast though
---
Oh for sure it's a great area with a nice vibe to it, beautiful flat lands with nothing in sight except for endless salty flats with basilisks, vultures and scorpions. Can't wait to find those pesky venom sac's again to be honest :D
---
Not if you haven’t subbed
---
It won't end. There will be a few restarts.. But you can log in and create a char all weekend. Monday morning you can start making 10 chars per realm, up to 50 total
---
Any class that uses PoD would be the most expensive at 39, and probably hunters after them for Shadowforge Bushmaster.
---
It happens here because people have been tired of retail for almost 10 years now or more.  This isn't a competition, if people felt like it was a competition we wouldn't have been saying that we think retail is shit for the last decade or more, but instead just started doing so.  The reason you are hearing it now is because we aren't being downvoted like over on /r/wow where if you whisper of hating some features like raid finder and wish it were removed we would be badgered for asking to remove the QoL changes.
---
We had a wall of no posted for christ sake when we asked for the version of the game we desired more because we disliked retail *so* much.  Retailers made fun of the idea of classic and would always just tell us to quit if we didn't like the game.  
---
Now that we have the game we want, whenever I hear someone come in and ask for stuff like transmog or balance changes or guild banks.. you bet your ass I'm going to shit on any retail-esq idea.  This isn't a competition for me idgaf if retail has 10million players and classic has 10k... keep the retail shit over on retail because it ruined the game for many of us.
---
i dont believe these will be available phase 1

Yes but in FFXIV you also have those people that refuse to listen when you try and help them (theres a reason "YOU DON'T PAY MY SUB" became a thing). I love FFXIV's community overall, but sometimes... Had a healer fairly recently who would literally just spam their Medica/Medica 2 outside the range of everyone and we would die from guaranteed damage and would get upset when we call her on it. After about 3 wipes on the same boss we were like can you at least stand close enough to us to hit us with those spells if that is all you're going to do. She would literally run to one corner and spam those 2 spells and miss everyone while we were doing mechanics of the boss. Was frustrating but we tried dealing with it. Eventually she got mad at us and called us jerks (we never were RUDE we just tried to teach her) and we got a replacement healer and finished the dungeon without any issues at all... Sometimes people just don't want/care to learn or try :|

I don't think they're as bad until you realize the first image is the current images and the second is the older ones. It's such a downgrade in quality and personality.
---
Ty for the fast reply!
---
Yes, but remember you're limited to 3 characters total per account until it actually launches.
---
&gt;"Probably an anti-vaxxer as well." 
---
Like as if that's an insult to anybody with an ounce of intelligence and awareness. Reddit clowns regurgitating the mainstream script as per usual, I see. Makes me wonder if you're being funded by pharmaceutical companies, or if you're just deeply conditioned by society?
---
I'ma take the down-vote plunge on this one.
---
😭 I'm just a little ol' frost mage minding my own business.
---
No problem!

The classiclfg (aka CallToArms in actual vanilla/pservers) addon makes searching for a group easier as it parses the chat and alerts the user that someone is forming a specific dungeon group. On the other hand, if you want to make a group it posts in the public chat channels for you. If you believe anything else, I feel sorry for you.
---
thanks for fix and update
---
Took me about a day to figure this one out.
---
Can I get a link to this addon? I was searching for it recently and didn't manage to find it.
---
I mean, I don't think it's truly in the spirit of classic.
---
Which is why I won't use it.
---
Others will likely have an improved classic experience because of it, and that's what it's all about.
---
Maybe. I was on a full server and it was not used (the same server as Leeroy to give you an idea lol)
---
I have a feeling it might have been popular mostly on a specific server or three, but unknown on most others. It'd almost have to be the case for it to have worked well with enough people to see benefits while still having so few downloads.
---
I agree that the classic servers will have a lot of people using an LFG addon.
---
Medium is more players than a full server in Vanilla. I'm sure its fine.
---
Stuck on mage or druid...
---
Paladin main for life but my bud us going to roll one this time. He'll be my #2
---
This whole post gave me PTSD of classic to LK raid groups when I sucked.
---
This reminds me of my RL she yelled such things to in TS oh boi
---
Sweet, ty.
---
Sweet, thanks!

Paladin is not a nightmare to level, if you genuinely believe any class with self healing and an immunity bubble is a "nightmare" to level then there's something wrong with you.
---
Paladin leveling is boring, it's not slow nor painful, it's just boring.
---
I'm in this boat. I subbed, and then did some testing on a private server.
---
Almost every single time a large game developer has had the best modders in the community run a game release by themselves it's an absolute shit show.
---
before i got in a melee cleave group i was going to multibox warlocks and a paladin just so i didnt need to level as ret lol
---
I just want a Teebu.
---
This is retarded and the reason why Reddit can't be used to dictate anything.
---
Don't. Just 70 more hours. You can endure through this. You can.
---
Isnt 0.5 just a catch-up tier? If you raid you dont need it.
---
Don't worry they'll coax you in with a free polar bear cub pet at the tail end of BC, next thing you know you'll be drinking verification cans of mountain dew.

Quite drinks ages ago, I just use pills now. 1 pill = 1 drink adn it's like 8$ for 200 instead of 2 for 5$
---
the hype will kill the fun of it, ppl will just flood the servers and gettingn in will be hell
---
Manually adding them is super easy. I've never trusted any of the "apps" that do it for you.
---
But then you get down to “/who level 50 night elf priest feralas” and suddenly it doesn’t matter that it only returns 50. That’s how the census addon works.
---
Shitty stuff my dude. I’m not looking at classic as the ‘saviour’ but man, am I ever looking forward to it.
---
"the 11th of october" and "october 11th" are used interchangeably though...
---
you ever heard "the fourth of july"?
---
What are these archaic relics? Some sort of primitive storage device?
---
Not a personal fan of the talent path for leveling but otherwise this is outstanding!
---
Great work!
---
Never, I believe the negatives far outweigh the only benefit of "style"
---
Others will be able to answer more in depth, but long story short.
---
a) It is the fastest class to level.
---
b) it has probably lowest raid dmg but certain abilities make it an essential companion in a raid.
---
c) it is very easy to play, but mastering it is very difficult.
---
I downvoted before reading the post. I also kept the downvote after realizing what it was for.
---
Enpass. It’s a password manager! It remembers and can create random passwords for you!
---
Sure, it is less punishing, but it can be very punishing depending on the dungeon.
---
Can you imagine getting a replacement in sunken temple? There are so many elites outside they will never make it in alone.
---
Scarlet monastery as ally? It is located in buttfuck - nowhere and most people won't even have a mount at this point. Dire maul is similarly remote.
---
This is of course moot if you have a warlock, but even then you have to run outside to port people in, risking fighting re spawns and PvP.
---
Yes, absolutely.  You'll see a guy killing the same mobs as you and you send him an invite.  Once you say I have x left and they respond, you ask "Do you have this quest", next thing you know you're running a bunch of quests together
---
True, I'm sure encryption can be done if you really wanted.
---
great post, thanks. i played vanilla but never used a Call to Arms add-on, and this clears a lot of things up for me
---
i agree that this is not a problem at all and a total non-issue. classic release will probably come and go and people will forget all about this silly "controversy" by next tuesday
---
haha we couldent resist the reference! his music videos are top tier
---
Man, why can’t life always be this easy?
---
Lol I walked into that one didn't I.

Logout other person resets instance log back in and you are at the start with a reset instance

Basically going to work my self to exhaustion so I am forced to sleep through the weekend.
---
Or you know sit on reddit refreshing every 5 seconds wishing it was over
---
Im only working Monday.
---
How do you get those tokens?
---
xD
---
Could be +50 to perception too!
---
How does it work with the skill tree when you swap weapons like that? Do i go points in both arms and prot with more focus on the prior?
---
You're going to be spammed with people inviting you to a group.  So, nope.  No problem.
---
I personally hope they unfuck retail and make it like classic again. There are some changes I will eventually want like improved graphics and the ability to use different mounts for tauren.
---
I can't get those in a #nochanges wow classic, but retail blows.
---
&gt;Will I have to be a GM and/or a raid leader to even get a spot anywhere?
---
Definitely not. In pretty much every MMO, tanks are always the role with the highest demand.
---
&gt; I know if I mess up just once in a rotation that I could cause everyone to wipe
---
This definitely is not the case in lower level dungeons, it might cause a bit of chaos, but with more experience you'll be able to regain control relatively quickly or prevent it from happening in the first place.
---
&gt; I just hope people are a bit more forgiving early on in dungeons as i'm learning it all
---
As long as you let them know you're relatively knew ahead of time, people are generally fairly understanding. Depending on the situation, tell them it's your first time tanking, first time doing a specific dungeon/boss, or that you've only done the instance a few times. Most groups are just thankful that they found a tank.
---
A couple small tips I'll give:
---
* ALWAYS use revenge when you can. It's your highest threat generating move and it only costs 5 rage. The final protection tree talent, Shield Slam, generates more threat but also costs 20 rage.
---
* When pulling a pack of mobs, make sure the group is on the same page about what mob is the focus kill priority and what mob(s) are CC priority. This can be done with raid icons, or if your group is experienced with that dungeon, it might be understood what the priorities are. Also note that this isn't mandatory to clear a dungeon, but it can help a rough dungeon run go smoother.
---
* Remaining on the subject of mob packs, make sure you hit as many as you can with a Demo shout and then focus revenges on the main kill target until it's about to die. Demo shout generates a bit of threat which prevents your healer from pulling aggro.
---
* If your healer (or whoever) does pull aggro, and the mob isn't close to death, taunt it! After you taunt the mob, make sure to use an ability or two on it, otherwise the mob will most likely go back to attacking the person that initially aggro'd it
---
Mate, I don't even have/know what e-mails I would have used!
---
Consecration is a holy talent. You only had 2 Buttons, seal and judge, 8sec cd and if you "spammed" it you went oom. At higher level killing a mob literally takes 20-30 sec.
---
The proc rate of clearcasting was waaaaaaay off on private servers and that might influence these guides. Without that not sure how you can compete with the mana efficiency of frost or AoE grinding.
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
I shed a tear in solidarity for this. Undead or troll priest or maybe an orc warlock. Or maybe an undead warlock. Undead my favourite race but trolls be flippin out mon and orc warlocks makes me feel like Gul'Dan. Life is easier than WoW.

In addition, stir fries are easy to cook and heat up in the microwave well if you didn’t want to skillet to heat it up. My favorite quick recipe is below.

**Emergency Protein with Curry &amp; Cabbage**
---
Recipe from the Nom Nom Paleo™ app
---
Makes : 4 Servings
---
Hands-On Time : 15 min
---
Total Time : 15 min
---
The idea behind emergency protein (a.k.a. garbage stir-fry) is to quickly cook up whatever protein and vegetables you have lingering in the fridge. Ground meat is budget-friendly and perfect for stir-frying, and with some vegetables and spices, you'll soon have a big batch of food that you can shovel into your mouth whenever necessary.
---
**Ingredients:**
---
* 1 pound ground meat (venison, beef, pork, or lamb)
---
* 1 tablespoon Ghee or fat of choice
---
* ½ large onion, diced
---
* 2 teaspoons Madras curry powder or seasoning of choice
---
* kosher salt
---
* Freshly-ground black pepper
---
* 2 cups roughly chopped cabbage or bite-sized fresh or frozen vegetables of your choice
---
* Juice from ½ lime or a splash of vinegar
---
**Preparation Steps:**
---
* If your meat's still frozen, submerge it in hot tap water for 15 minutes or until it's thawed. [1 lb ground meat]
---
* Heat your cooking oil of choice in a large cast iron skillet. [1 T Ghee or fat of choice]
---
* Cook the onions until they're soft and translucent. [½ large onion, diced]
---
* Add the ground meat to the onions in the skillet.
---
* Break it up with a wooden spoon, and…
---
Stir fry until the pink's gone.
---
* Sprinkle the curry powder on the ingredients, season with the salt and pepper to taste, and stir to incorporate. [2 tsp Madras curry powder salt pepper]
---
* Throw in the cabbage, and… [½ small cabbage, roughly chopped]
---
* Cover and cook for 2 minutes or until the cabbage softens.
---
* Taste and adjust the seasonings as desired.
---
Add a spritz of lime juice, and… [juice from ½ lime]
---
* Plate it up. This recipe calls for curry and cabbage, but it can be endlessly modified, so feel free to improvise. Just sample the food while you cook, and stop seasoning when it tastes right.

I head the average /played till level 60 is 8 days, or 192 hours, I hope we don't lose a ton of people on the way
---
Hid the names on the messages so this would t become recruitment for them
---
Nightmare? Far from..they basically have zero downtime. You just keep killing whereas warriors have to take good breaks after every other mob. Paladin is *easy* to level. It’s just slower and less engaging than pretty much every other class.
---
What server are you playing on? If you want dm me and we can see about playing together if you'd want. I'm always looking for more peeps to play with.
---
Maybe I want to dress better than a hobo...
---
Yeah, I quit in Wrath and I felt like the game had a satisfying sendoff this way.  The lich king was destroyed, I was happy, and my rogue went to sleep with his blades plenty bloody from PvP.
---
That said, bring on Classic baby.
---
There are still people in the WoW subreddit with that mentality...
---
Most obvious cosplay ever?
---
lol dude, my last guild once 1-shot Twin Emps, and then did an Ony that same night and wiped twice because of overzealous DPS.
---
None of them will be needed for the first 3-7 days at least. I would wait and let others be the beta testers and then get the mods people are suggesting after a week.
---
This way you also get to experience classic with no mods like it was back in the early days.
---
This, and it seems like the Danes and Norwegians are going to Firemaw instead.
---
That's bullshit and you know it. Most classes don't even have AoE at that level. 
---
When did you last level in BFA, I've leveled 3 characters from 0 to 120 in the past four months. It's certainly easy but pulling 30 things or anything more than 3 on most classes? hell no.
