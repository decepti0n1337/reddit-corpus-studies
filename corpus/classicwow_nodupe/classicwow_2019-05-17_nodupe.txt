they had not mentioned it previously

blizz also likes money
---
Nice.
---
Check out Skarm the tank on Youtube, his channel is basically about druid and warrior tanking.
---
Naw... that's not going to allow blizzard to extract every last delicious shekel from a larger group of their fans.
---
Hope i get one! Lets go boys
---
Absolutely based
---
Ooooooooh. o.o
---
what's next ? a reddit guild ?
---
Lots of reviews don't like them very much. I think they are more for show than anything. Watch some YT reviews on them. Most I've seen don't have much positive to say.
---
Is it impossible to imagine that going as fast as possible might be the greater experience for some?
---
Hey fuck you buddy - Warlock
---
If you have a guild where DKP works without drama, Loot council would work without drama too.
---
I've never seen a DKP system that's actually fair. I truly believe a DKP system will always be flawed. You would have to take into account so many different aspects and even then you'd end up having different views. Simple example: Let's say warlorks and mages roll on mostly the same items. You got 5 warlocks and 10 mages in your roster. Naturally warlocks will get their sets cheaper. You could solve this by saying you'd have a seperate dkp pool for sets. But than someone will say this is not fair, because for some classes the set is best in slot, for others it's not.
---
One of my personal favorites is the topic if agreements to pass on items so someone else can get the item for min dkp. This starts with some say that it should be allowed, it's just clever to do that and others say that undermines the whole point of bidding on the items. If you decide such agreements are forbidden, some people will do this anyways. If you allow it, people will complain classes like mages, which you'll most likely have alot of in raid, will have a hard time to form an agreement, while others like hunters, which you might only have 2 in raid, won't.
---
I also experience alot of controversy about what should grant DKP. Should only actual raiding grant DKP or also if you're available as backup. Is farming for the raid (flasks etc) something you can DKP with? If you say yes, there'll be people that complain, they have a job and it's unfair since they don't have the time to do extra besides the raid.
---
You can go on and on and on with this. I don't want to say DKP will always be drama. It's just that in my experience Loot Council is no more drama than DKP. It depends on the guild, if you'll end up having drama because of the loot, no matter the system. With Loot Council the loot will at least be distributed in a way that benefits the raid.
---
I swear half the rogue ‚Äúworld pvp‚Äù (more like ganking casters as they leveled) was set to that song
---
This tickles me... multiple discussion had about this where the response is: ‚Äúthe numbers from vanilla videos line up with pservers hurr durr.‚Äù
---
Which of course is fine if you don‚Äôt understand that the math involved can be vastly different and still get the same numbers.
---
\[Orcish\] Kek!
---
You know people don't jump into college right after high school right?
---
Hell no play whatever you like man, if you pick a race you don't even like just because of the racial you'll regret it forever. Sure undead has a slight advantage but actually liking your char and it's animations beats it all day.
---
Married, two kids. Game time is 2100-0000 EST, LFG for dungeons, pvp shenanigans and lite rp. Faction and server don't matter. I mained alliance paladin in vanilla, but I think I'll be all over the map this go.
---
I just hope that Blizz doesn't end up pulling the legacy expansions out of the standard game at any point. I like taking my 120 character into the old raids to solo farm for transmogs and mounts.
---
I used the 3440p and simply set it to center and slid it to the left since there's at much free space there. Looks perfect
---
Wow kris you‚Äôre like a super smart dude blizz should hire you ASAP.
---
correct
---
if you dont unequip your bow for the hunter class call your bow breaks
---
He probably meant about changes. Not about fixing bugs compared to the accurate or correct Vanilla behavior.
---
People are saying that because the Twitch game list re-organizes based on whatever game has the most viewers at any given point in time. Clearly with day 1 of the beta Classic had a lot of interest on Twitch and it had the most viewers for quite some time.
---
You really don't have to read into it any more than that. The statement that it was (or maybe is?) #1 is true.
---
This comment didnt age well, as you can see later in his stream his damage has increased by insane amounts. 
---
It was the right choice.
---
You're aren't play the game from 10 years ago.  
---
You're playing a improved version.
---
They're the types of people who have been saying no to people wanting classic for years. I'd be upset too if blizz shat all over me by giving the people I've been telling are not allowed to have fun exactly what they wanted. Feels good.

WORLD FIRST WORLD FIRST WOE
---
Swear if I see WORLD FIRST one more time on a video or thread I'mma bust a fucking vein.

It's not a world first anything anymore. It's not.

Dude has a dick on his forehead
---
&gt; Paid transfers didn't happen in vanilla WoW until way late it's it's run, close to if not around the time the TBC patch came out.
---
Which means that they happened during Vanilla WoW, so your entire argument that they didn't is completely false by your own admission.
---
Paid transfers were introduced around June 2006, around patch 1.11.
---
6 month cooldown. You could not transfer from a PvE server to a PvP server, but could transfer from a PvP server to a PvE. You could not transfer to a PvP server where you had a character of the opposite faction already. Had to be at least level 10. You could only bring 5k gold (for characters level 51-60, decreasing amounts for lower level brackets). On top of that, newer realms could not be transferred to immediately on launch, I think there was a 3 month period before transfers to a newly launched realm would be allowed. Though this might've come in later after some previous abuses, I can't remember the details on that restriction exactly.
---
Prior to paid character transfers, free transfers ("migrations") were opened up from time to time to address population imbalances or over-population, yes.
---
The argument that there shouldn't be transfers in Classic is asinine. Maybe not until later phases, sure, but the Devs have already said they would be available at some point due to them being available in original Vanilla.
---
This is a private server bug.

So far from what I can tell its the current live api, if you need me to check anything feel free to respond here to this message.
---
I think there is something to be said for the ***perception*** of reward. 
---
The new talent tree system has a greater impact on what you do and how you play than the old talent tree system. With the old talent tree you don't actually perform any differently when you gain 1% chance to crit, as an example. Even putting 5 points into that talent doesn't really make you noticeably stronger in the game world, mathmatically speaking. You might ***feel*** stronger, which I guess is the overall draw, but your power hasn't noticeably changed. 
---
When done right, the new talent system offers you options of give and take (focus on AoE or single target) and in some cases competitive choices with each tier. It sometimes offers a completely new way to play a class. 
---
The old talent tree system doesn't really offer you that choice, or I should say, offers the illusion of choice. You're not going to skip the important talents going down your spec tree and there's usually no talent that you have to really compare or give up as you go. 
---
You'll typically always go a certain way for PvE and PvP builds. That's just min-maxing. 
---
Important abilities that you would pick up by putting points in (like Hemorrhage) you're ***never*** going to skip, so you just get them at the appropriate level when you level with the new system. 
---
As far as pruning goes, they usually pruned abilities that players typically never used. I guess it's human nature to want to "feel prepared" by having everything on your bar in case you need it. From a design point of view, you want to make spells worth using, and if you can't you have to be ready to part with them. 
---
Like, for example, Warlocks had the spell Shadow Ward. It protected from shadow damage like a bubble. Yet, you'd rarely use it. 
---
"But I used / would use / it!", sure, but was it a viable choice? Was it better than throwing out more dps? In most cases, no.
---
So why have the clutter? 
---
 
---
&gt; going to feel LEAGUES more rewarding than retail.
---
Which I guess is what it comes down to. It ***feels*** good and therefore it has value for you.
---
But feeling and actually factually being better are two different things.
---
What's the DPS of that staff? Look at it.
---
No, they do not.
---
Please, learn what automate actually means.

To be fair, they have an internal QA team for in more detailed bug tracking. While bug reports from the player community is benifitial, public beta is mostly used for server tests (and probably the new layer system) and general feedback. Having them just play like normal players is still really useful.
---
My son, who is still in HS right now (graduates in june) played back in in 04.  I let him play an Alt and run around hitting rocks and picking plants.... he was to young to know I was using him to farm mats for me.  When he got older I got hom his own account and we'd spend every night working on and 2v2 rating  until they ruined pvp.
---
Legion would have 1 server and like 2,000 shards. Classic will have 1 server with like 2 or 3 layers.
---
totally the same.
---
Who is complaining about graphics?
---
Youre like one of those fearmongerers saying the muslims want your xmas trees lmao.
---
I answered your question. It's the answer. And it's fucking obvious if you spend some time reading rather than all your time dreaming these problems up. No need to post 18 paragraphs about it. Are you going to do the same about people who believe in satan, think the world is flat and believe eating their own sperm is healthy?
---
And so what if you are colourblind? Boo fucking hoo. My father is colourblind as an electrician and still alive after all these years.

The gatekeeping in this thread is hilarious
---
There's plenty of weekend raiding guilds, yes.
---
But if you only have time to play 2 days a week, raid progression in AQ40/Naxx will be kinda tough.
---
"It's just nostalgia"
---
"Private vanilla servers have had fairly large player bases for the past couple of years"
---
"Uh well that's just because it's free"
---
These people, I swear
---
&gt; Merge realms then
---
Congrats, you just got merged with the server you 100% chose to NOT join because your ex plays there.
---
Have fun seeing your ex in trade chat 1,000 times a day, even though you 100% chose the option to not have that happen.
---
he mad ? he looks mad.
---
It's a "new" release, of course it's going to have an extra hype train behind it.
---
That's not to say that I'm one of the naysayers. Classic WoW is going to do some work.
---
To me that doesn‚Äôt actually read as you need a sub to be invited, but a sub to play.
---
iirc defensive did not automatically assist your target if you weren't getting attacked, that was added after vanilla.
---
I think the slippery slope part of the argument is something like this:
---
1. The only thing keeping blizzard from introducing microtransactions is the fact that their core audiance are so adverse to them that doing it wouldnt be profitable enough to cover their loss.
---
2. If we allow small changes like QoL and graphics toggles we will to some degree normalize *all* and *any* changes in general, and lower the core audiances' hostility towards them.
---
3. After a while changes will be so normalized that the players will be ready to accept a cash shop with mounts and sharding and personal loot etc without much oposition. The player base will have had their boundries constantly overstepped and their core values gradually taken from them like a frog slowly being boiled to death.
---
Again. Im not saying this is what i think would happen necessarily. But i think the logic is solid and you dont have to make any irrational assumptions.
---
In the thousands of hours I've played vanilla back then and "later" I've never ever been body camped for more than a death or two.
---
Yes it's in it's nerfed state in 1.12, it unstealths you as soon as you take any action, ie starting an aimed shot cast. It's not really useful unless the person you're attacking is looking at another screen or afk.
---
Chance certainly wasnt pr√©par√©s.
---
Mountain Dew, coffee, popcorn, and candy. 
---
Also permission from wife to leave you alone.
---
&gt; blizz also likes money
---
I mean they are a business. And it's actually reasonable to assume adding a token to Classic WoW would have a more negative impact on the financial potential/success of the product.
---
&gt; they had not mentioned it previously 
---
Probably because it's never even been on the table, so why bring it up? It would ruin the economy, which in turn would ruin the entire point of bringing out classic wow servers...
---
A few points of str isn't really that much, especially that early on, the raw dps increase the staff gives is far superior.
---
Always loved the "UPOTTED" tears. Getgud and utilize what the game offers.
---
First try! Awesome.
---
&gt; If that happens I will admit I was completely wrong.
---
the vanilla population dropoff is *nuts*. all, which was 4 or 5, of my old friends joined the big N server a few years ago (among other servers). none of them make it past level 20. The dropoff is fast and it is steep. people either know what they're getting into, or they find out real quick. I think classic will get stable populations and end layering in weeks, not months/phases.
---
The game is still 3 months away and I honestly doubt the entire layering system and its functionality has been finalized. Which is why I get triggered when people lump it in with sharding in an effort to lazily paint it as existentially bad. nobody knows the full story on how this works and it's a disservice to just say "oh they wont fix it because they dont actually care about that game".
---
More respect to the warriors than the mage despite the level gap
---
20k lol people have been waiting for this since 2010
---
Ya tons of people make alts for something to do. There could also be new people slowly streaming in. Not saying more players on the servers just some more people rolling. 
---
I was on a private server with 100-200 people online regularly. This was way before nost was even a thing. Somehow we found people to do dungeons.
---
I would pay like 2-3 gold to hear that.
---
Well, Thrall is green Jesus now and hasn't been involved in the story for years (until next update, I guess), Vol'jin, Cairne, and Varian are all dead, loot is all instanced (you don't roll on it anymore), you can still die in higher difficulty raids, endgame dungeons are all races against a timer w/ various weekly mob effects thrown in, mobs are all scaled to your level, there's no talent trees and classes are defined entirely by spec (Frost mages can't shoot fireballs, etc).  It's a different game.
---

What are you talking about? I'm going to tear up the dps charts with my 0.2% dps boost from my 12 extra agility at lvl 60. Poor dwarves will be begging me to join their group, it will take them like an extra 5 minutes to kill Rag. No second sons wave spawning for my raid.
---
Played vanilla from the open beta until most of the way through TBC with a couple of month break around I think 1.10. And I had never heard of joana until I came to this sub. 
---
All of us just like to play games and don't care about the personalities associated with them.
---
MrGM got an invite and he has EU people on his friends list that he saw online in the Beta too
---
Also I‚Äôm certain devs/other people from blizzard will be watching his stream.
---
Not everyone read guides or cares about game celebrities.
---
I misspoke a bit about the spirit regen and edited above to try to limit misinformation. Won't work while casting, but if you stop casting your spirit regen will kick in, regardless of combat status. Some abilities would let you keep gaining mana even while casting (E.g. Mage armor). 
---
The mp5 bit I wasn't sure of, been a long time, thanks for clarifying.
---
FOR. THE. HORDE.

I posted about this in the Horde Rogue Sword post. His "guides " look neat and organized but the information is off and poorly diseminated. Its like information vomit.

"Please note that this list is not a complete depiction of what we‚Äôre aware of, but a sampling of issues we believe players may encounter with some regularity. We‚Äôll try to keep this updated with trending issues when possible."
---
Or maybe you didn't read the post fully.
---
Spoken like a true T_D‚Äôer.
---
Yeah man, literally no other support besides money matters. /s 
---
Yup totally reluctant to pay for the game! /s
---
Get a grip and stop your assumptions. I can‚Äôt WAIT to pay to PLAY the game. This is paying to reserve names. 
---
You don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs frustrations with companies for trying to make profits at every chance they can when people are willing to pay? 
---
Sounds like you may be a supporter of micro transactions. It‚Äôs not cool if paying extra/early gets you some advantage over others. People keep lumping in bogus examples like this. This is simply, pay extra to not even play the game, just reserve names.  Got people saying I don‚Äôt love wow or classic and that I‚Äôm not a true supporter. You‚Äôre toxic.
---
Definitely had two friends fail out of school because of WoW. And one because of FFXI. That dude was pro, he had multiple accounts and two laptops.
---
wtf, so fast
---
It‚Äôs really this simple.

its actually so nuts how good cruel barb is lol, if you can get 2, you can use them until like the mid 30's

Cyaaaaa

Are you Lil Pump's anal wart? Get the fuck out of here with this bullshit. Must be a slow day at Subway.

---
People asked for the original, not a re-make. They want lion king 1994, not national geographic with bad dubbing ala 2019. And that's what they were promised.
---
If you're too thick to realise that, it's ok, but don't expect me or anyone else capable of differentiating their elbow from their anus to care.
---
It's an *option*. You can play with classic graphics. 
---
I know it sounds crazy, but you don't have to play with the updated graphics.
---
To be fair, the guy is 25 years old. He was 11 back in vanilla and most likely didn't know what the fuck to do.
---
As an OSRS player, I've seen this same exact thing happen back in 2012 and 2013 with the RS3 playerbase. The **exact** same thing.
---
Now OSRS has 4x the playerbase than the "main game". I'm not sure if Classic will see quite THAT level of success (mostly because the main game still appeals to millions of players) but I truthfully would not be surprised if classic will hold more players than retail.
---
Give it a few months, all the naysayers will shut up and it'll be great going back and reading their comments after they've been proven wrong.
---
He dOeS tOo mUcH DaMagE - 'report bug'
---
Guaranteed you‚Äôre the worst.
---
Imagine getting upset over how people play a video game.
---
So definitely undead.
---
No they don‚Äôt.
---
&gt; The fact you can't tell this is an issue for sharding just as much as it is an issue for increased server population is pathetic.
---
Yeah, only difference is one has 3+ hour long queue for starter mobs at launch, the other doesn't.
---
But most memorable by the widest audience. Most people made it to at least 20-25, not everyone made it to 60. I sure didn‚Äôt. I might have made 35 at the most. But I ran VC a hundred times on various characters. It‚Äôs  the most nostalgic dungeon in the game.
---
If someone wipes out of spite, then yet its a kick. I was talking mainly just about a bad player like someone who sucks at CC or damage. In Vanilla, the goal is to help those people, not like retail where you curse at them and kick them from group.
---
This thread is literally about how there is an option slider for modern graphics settings in classic wow.
---
You're not a "content creator", you're just posting bad information. But keep it up, just remember all of who follow Kargoz's guides; name your toons "Freekill" if youre on a PVP server. 
---
edit or Xxfreekillxx if the above is taken üòò
---
Undead is nice for PvP. There will be substantially less warlocks on alliance side tho. Wotf breaking seduce and making you immune is definitely really good.  
---
On the other hand troll has a sick jump where their tusks go into the air. It's pretty valuable in both PvP and PvE.
---
From the perspective of a software developer, all of this seems par for the course. Folks that don't make software don't quite understand the complexity behind seemingly simple software.
---
Agree with you that Blizzard is doing this the right way, with the right people. I'm not worried at all. I'd love the game in my hands tomorrow, but appreciate that the quality needs to be top-notch before that can happen. Blizzard is pretty damn good at QA, and this particular project lends itself even moreso to crowd-based QA as well through this beta.
---
No arguments about what is 'right' though. They can always try the same on their reference impl and know for sure. That's a nice advantage over a normal game.
---
&gt; from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in
---
Many people have been opted into the standard Warcraft beta for over a decade.
---
His/her point is valid. At least in that regard.
---
Yeah that's why i said " Might be wrong tho " at the end
---
Where have you been for the past two years? They explained why they cannot just re-release the same old codebase, they explained that they have *a functional copy of vanilla wow* running to double check with, and that the entire reason for a beta is finding those weird edge cases that seem off and referencing the original game.
---
The hard way ended in 2.3
---
And yet he still genuinely persists that he doesn‚Äôt make THAT much money. People were saying he was a millionaire and he kept denying basically acting like an average joe lol
---
I got to a couple of these so far. I'm playing horde right now and haven't tried alliance yet so I haven't tested a couple of the things you suggested.
---
Swimming fatigue seems to be working appropriately. I swam out from Ratchet and once I got into deep water the fatigue bar showed up and began to drain. When it emptied I started taking damage, eventually dying. Then I ran my ghost out there, and again once my ghost got over deep water the fatigue bar showed up and started to drain. When it emptied my ghost died was ported back to the spirit healer above Ratchet. This all matches my memory of vanilla exploring.
---
I haven't yet found a spot where I can get myself stuck, but I did try to use the unstuck button anyway. It worked fine both alive and as a ghost. Once you can complete the "stuck" spell-cast, it teleports you back to the spirit healer if you were a ghost. If you're alive and your hearthstone is ready, it will hearth you. If you're alive and your hearthstone is not ready, it kills you and sends your ghost to the nearest spirit healer. I don't think the auto-unstuck feature was part of vanilla, but this seems like the sort of thing that they intend to keep in there to reduce the demand for GM tickets.

Lol I can‚Äôt believe people are downvoting you. Snowflake sub.
---
He was all heated from a guy in chat and said it literally right after

Oh dang, I quit a month into TBC so didn't know.

was this confirmed somewhere that you need an active sub? haven't been following it that well.
---
He gonnn
---
1. &gt; AS FAR AS WE KNOW
---
2. Who the fuck cares about loot trading?
---
3. This is not 2004. you can run virtual servers. it costs the same to host 1 player on classic as it does 1 player on retail. that links points to an unrelated wow thread.
---
The biggest Issue is that they only send out Invites to Retards! Guys like Madseason, Joana and Frostradamus should have gotten in. Like wtf is wrong with them?
---
I just got in, not a streamer
---
Cosmetics are very important, and classic should have the same ones as before.  There should *definitely* not be any of that new model crap, a player making a character in the old system won't look the same at all in the new system.  Even on live, plenty of players went from "old face #N" to "new face #M" because N changed so much that M is now closer.  
---
That being said, colorblind mode is a different beast completely.  That's an accessibility option, not a cosmetic option.  I would have been puzzled and a bit cross if it had been left out.
---
But these guys are vanilla experts that have been playing it constantly for 15 years are know absolutely every about it and as the faces of our community are the best players.  Or something like that.
---
Verdan the Everliving, the bane of fraudulent streamers
---
Can anyone explain to me why they like to play healer? Is it really that exciting to get the best healing gear and get better heals? Does healing gear translate 1-1 for dps gear on say a priest?
---
Hey everyone!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In my continued work to chronicle everything I remember about my vanilla experience, I finally reached this gem from spring of 2006 - the first time I ever ran Maraudon. There's a lot of blank spaces, of course (it's been like...13 years), but what I do remember clearly is how this dungeon single-handedly changed my WoW experience from then on.  
---
What do you all remember from this sprawling purple and orange labyrinth?
---
If it's not that they just want to artificialy pump their sub numbers to make more money out of a beta. Pay the sub if you're invited to the beta okay, pay the sub to have a chance to maybe have access is bullshit though.
---
Paladins are so good at healing in PvP I can't even imagine you could make a PvE healing spec that's somehow gimped for PvP. 
---
Use mouseovers to cast Sac on people. It's way easier to remove it if you see a paladin target his buddy. Also it can be applied to pets to throw shamans and priest that think they are good for a loop. It would actually take a bad player to sit there purge spamming pets and every target under the sun so it's incredibly powerful in PvP.
---
Fuck your HD models, no fucking changes.
---
:-) /kiss the irony in proving me right, or why there can be no report feature, is palpable.
---
Well a lot of people do. So Nyeh :~p
---
Was that in vanilla?
---
I agree - also the feeling of getting a slightly larger quiver is amazing!
---
Yeah. Reddit‚Äôs group think and upvote system is considerably worse though.
---
Cool, glad to hear it!
---
Completely wrong, Prime subs actually give MORE money than paid subs as their base revenue is the full $4.99 which then gets split between Twitch and the streamer. 
---
Other subs never count for the full value as any payment fees are deducted first before revenue is split.
---
That's especially noticeable with subs from Europe which can easily be only worth $4 pre-split.
---
You're a lucky one. I used to make macros to /target (insert ganked name) so i could spam that as soon as they re spawned to find them easier.  Can't wait to do this again :D
---
Male Tauren just look so much better once they have gear, imo.
---
August 26th, the last day I have to deal with this subreddit!
---
Prime uses the T1 split, which, with the basic partner contract, is 50/50.
---
It only affected how *you* saw the character.  So if you made an undead with straps over the eyes, you could still see him, but everyone else couldn't (the straps wouldn't go over the eyes).  Or you could end up with a character where the face you want is number 4 on the old model and number 8 on the new model, because they didn't port anything right.
---
Who said that? I'm missing something here cause that is either obvious troll or common sense has completely gone out of style.

Exactly, color blind mode makes the game more accessible.  That's not cosmetic at all.  Cosmetic changes makes the game more like retail.  They aren't the same thing at all.

It's streamers and players like this that make me embarrassed to tell people in real life that I play video games. Video game streamers have some of the most obnoxious personalities I have ever seen. I mean honestly, when i first saw his name, tipsout, it was enough to make me not click a single link here.

These people need to be being shunned from the gaming community. It's fucking embarrassing to the community.

You can solo the part of SFK that you need for Verigan's Fist at around 22 if you know what you're doing. At one point it involves interacting with an NPC while bubbled and then taking an intentional death, but whatevs man, hammers are worth it.
---
None of the most popular servers are at that level of shit tier qualitym if you actually DID play on private server you sure as hell didn't do any research as to the ones you be playing on.
---
Nice new generation shitty terms. Everything to you is "epic" and "gourmet" and "meme".

Because anyone who would make a decision as dumb as making a female Tauren means you can depend on them to make more stupid decisions

You don't even need to be a bigger streamer to get the $3.50 contract. I have it and I currently have less than 60 average viewers.

You just need a decent amount of subs.

I have every belief that it will go the way of OSRS and that the legacy game mode will have way more played than the modern game if not immediately than in a very short amount of time.

Unpopular opinion: I think people should play how they want to play.
---
Partners get 3.50$, affiliates get 2.50$
---
dont you need to down the first boss?
---
These are not private server players, Soda is a retail baby that never played on private servers seriously and always quit at early levels, tips is a fucking moron that never played vanilla nor private servers, Navak seems like a retailbaby backpedaller aswell, Zuelase only played on 1v1 meme servers, the only guy on that group that played on private servers is Guzu.
---
Its not the best, but at least it is not little caesars/pizza hut.
---
No, I've played most of those and reviewed the ones I didn't. They aren't very good or I'd still be playing them. Monster Hunter is okay. Final fantasy sucks now. You just can't understand because you don't have enough experience. But hey keep thinking average to subpar games are awesome.
---
Even on retail he still hits hard.
---
once you get a beta invite i doubt you need an active sub
---
Okay but why would it matter what layer they‚Äôre on? There‚Äôs going to be the same amount of competition for resources on all the layers since they‚Äôre all going to have 2-3k population
---
Ok looks like I wont play classic wow then and cjaprice as wel. GL lul.
---
Because they look terrible
---
I'm kind of late to this post so it will probably just be buried, but there are a lot of misconceptions on this topic that I see come up a lot.
---
Vanilla/BC WoW never used vertical minus scaling. It didn't use scaling at all - FoV was always just a fixed amount. The FoV on 4:3 aspect ratio and 16:9 ratio was the same - whatever the wider screen picked up on the sides was lost on the top. The examples and diagrams in the link are just plain wrong.
---
The change that came with WotLK was the introduction of Vert+ scaling, PLUS an overall flat increase to FoV.
---
Basically the point I'm making is that there was never anything wrong with vanilla FoV that needed a "fix". It simply used a smaller FoV. And yes for the record I think this earlier vanilla FoV was superior and should be re-implemented, but there are many people that don't and like to play with the wider FoV despite the fact that it sort of has a negative effect on immersion and the feel of the game.
---
Obviously sub lol
---
I wouldn't say it's difficult, not really fun, but I wouldn't say very difficult, but slow going at times.
---
Guess we'll be playing for fun, ma boe
---
I literally just got invited.
---
the noobs are real
---
i played in 05 when i was 5-6. my brother got it and i played on his account but didnt have the attention span to get past westfall
---
You're too thick to realize we are not getting the original. It's a literally a remake to resemble vanilla WoW as much as possible.
---
Oof, that last line really hurt. You know there isn't going to be any sharding right? Maybe get your facts straight. 
---
I can see you just love to hate things.
---
They said their servers can handle a shit ton of concurrent players (I mean shit, if pservers can handle 10k players why can‚Äôt blizzard servers?)
---
New character models don't improve shit, those things are awful soulless golems, and no, being able to click a button that makes them right *just on my screen* doesn't fucking count.  It's a shared world.

Partners get 3.50$, affiliates get 2.50$.

I dont understand the need to rush and min/max. It's not new content. There are no world firsts, this time. It's all already been done a long time ago. Enjoy the ride.

They probably will, they did that with the bfa beta

Hey cool man, and I just want pet battles and group finder.  Lets do both!  That's how this works, right?

Oh, and class balance.  It's cruel to leave that out of course.
---
Just go with your irl sex. Both taurens look cool.
---
You don't need an active sub to get invited to beta.
---
Tauren is my favourite race by far and most of my chars are Tauren. I usually roll Male Tauren for Mail and Plate classes, and Female for Cloth and Leather.
---
Mail and Plate shoulders look better on the ridiculously huge male tauren shoulders, while cloth and leather look kinda silly at that size and fit the slimmer frames more imo.
---
Love that
---
I imagine hearing a streamer bitch and moan while you are ganking him is like taking heroin after a morphine injection to the spine
---
male tauren is considered on of the better looking races, female tauren is considered the worst looking horde race 
---
possibly the worst looking period
---
that said if you like the look go for it really does not matter much
---
Its all about the execution. Commenting "I used to defend you, but I can't defend crap like rolling on an item just so you can delete it. I'm unsubbing" isn't petty, it's accurate feedback
---
I feel like I vaguely remember doing this mid fight when leading a raid.  So I think so?
---
I plan to level a rogue to 60 ASAP. But sometime after (not sure what phase yet) I will start to casually level my dwarf warrior from 2006 for all those nostalgic feels.
---
This is a very well thought out post. Thank you.
---
You think yours are wet, mine could stick to the wall.
---
Not sure what a Grug is, and nothing is based on spite. No need to make yourself look silly by throwing around baseless accusations because you can't read :)
---
Yes you do
---
Thanks for such a structured reply, like I said I know very little about the technical side of this stuff, but I can‚Äôt help but notice the major difference in the current fov. Do you know if there is any ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way to enforce the old fov in the modern game? I really wanna do it in classic.
---
[Until you hit 60, this song needs to be on a loop](https://youtu.be/9D-QD_HIfjA)

It was confirmed you need a sub to be invited.
---
If thats true then I would just sub.
---
I mean I wont stop playing untill I hit 60, but I wont try to do things optimally or min maxy.
---
" You‚Äôre toxic" - \*Chuckles\* Yeah sorry I am also an intolerant machist bigot who supports an industry full of toxic masculinity and female oversexualization!
---
No, but jokes aside, what other support besides money matters to a company whose purpose is to make money? I mean I guess you could say you do free advertising for them but then again, you're just helping them get people other than you to spend money on their product, so what do you even mean?
---
"Sounds like you may be a supporter of micro transactions" - I don't know how you came up with that strawman but just to sate your curiosity I couldn't care less about micro transactions as long as they don't give a combat advantage in-game... In fact, I'm grateful for microtransactions in cases like being able to pay my way out of a dead realm, or change the race of my toon because I got bored of it, etc.
---
Now, just for the sake of curiosity, why are you so angry at it? Is your name really that popular that you feel you NEED to pay or else you'll be at disadvantage?
---
Everything I've read says you do
---
I'm 99% sure you can change loot rules at any time. I'm fairly sure if you scrub through some of the streams going on you can already see it being done.

Druid is leather/cloth, so are you recommending female?

So apparently you can't find min/maxing fun
---
Yes
---
those three didn't get in!?
---
Got mine based on this! Thanks for the tip :)
---
lol k
---
I never said we were, i just said what was promised.
---
Reading comprehension =)
---
So do retail addons work for Classic then?  Are do we have to wait for addon developers to release new versions to utilize them.
---
i think that his record should stay and be classed as vanilla and Classic should have its own it would still be nice to compare them between one another and i kinda hope he gets into the beta and people have some side by side of atleast Beta cap if he follows the exact same path
---
and much gnashing of the teeth
---
Sodapoppin streamed RFC last night, Asmon definitely benefited from Soda being asleep during that run, but still, 100k and 3k subs for a Deadmines run is pure insanity.
---
Its still useful
---
Is another wave going out? I want to get in just as much as anyone but I also understand its extremely unlikely. Don't get your hopes up guys you are only setting yourself for disappointment . Unless you are a bit streamer/youtuber and can offer free testing and hype for Blizzard.
---
kk wierd to need a sub to test , i understand getting in but to keep testing is strange
---
That must be with updated models because that's way more intense than the rain even on pservers
---
I feel like if any game doesnt need exposure its classic. But you are absolutely right lol
---
There are definitely weather effects. And jesus how fucking hyperbolic are you? There are 3 months of beta left? Do you understand what a beta is for?
---
It's a nice perk while levelling. Very limited use at 60 in any BG or PvE situation.
---
My college roommate got sucked in 02-06. I wonder if he ever graduated...

Do everyone a favor and be overleveled as the tank in PUGs. If you're on/under level your stats and gear will likely be inadequate and you'll make the run harder than it has to be. If you're in a group with friends or guildmates, do your thing...
---
It's not Harambeinaromper's fault it's not good. I mean, he didn't make the pizza shitty.

You do not need an active subscription to get an invite. You do need one to play the beta.
---
I'm not even here to argue one way or the other. I'm just here to say this: When you make a claim (for example, "Druids are considered better at leveling"), you're the one who needs to back it up. Reddit posts, forum posts, testimony from top players, YouTube videos, whatever. That's how it works.
---
If somebody says the world is flat, or vaccines are bad, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster is real, what do people say? (Other than the obvious.) They ask for proof. It's not THEIR job to DISPROVE flying spaghetti monsters - it's the CLAIMANT'S job to PROVE it. It's called the burden of proof.
---
You don't make a claim, then ask others to prove you wrong.
---
It depends if they keep updating it, osrs is a completely different game to when it was  released it‚Äôs like an alternate timeline to what RuneScape could of become if it went down a different development second, a second chance
---
No you don't.
---
In the beta my hunter had a shield and I still miss it.
---
Can you explain the 5% damage increase to druids for those of us lesser WoW-educated folk?
---
Oh don't worry there will be a massive market for converting retail gold to classic gold. When OSRS came out I watched people trade mountains of ingame currency at a ridiculous conversion rate for a small leg up in the old school game. I expect the same.
---
I used to switch between holy and ret every day *shudder*
---
Most people refuse to watch streams WITHOUT webcams.  I didn't really get it for a while either but it really helps you feel more involved in the stream.

Not to forget about the bad translations and not very good voices.

"Ventormenta", "El Rasganorte",  "Agonia de escarcha", "Entra√±as (undercity)"....  ‡≤†\_‡≤†

Maybe I'm remembering incorrectly but I thought there was always the ability to report other players to GMs.
---
&gt;Enjoy the ride
---
Some people enjoy min/maxing, being efficient and rushing. That's what I find to be fun.
---
*laughs in female Dwarf*
---
Yeah I'd go female, though for druid I personally would use your spec to decide. If Balance/Resto then I'd go female. Guardian I'd go male since I like male tanks, then a toss up for Feral dps, whichever.
---
Well both bfa release and both world first races did get more(maybe not bfd, not sure) but this is still fuckinf crazy for a beta and I think its higher considering that more streamers were streaming bfa release
---
There arent really...
---
I will take the official source from Blizzard over a podcasters word thanks.
---
I'm pretty sure they arent mate.
---
no dude... i want the BLUE staff...
---
Thank you for addressing nobody's point.
---
Yeah I'm the same, on Discord I'm seeing people discussing detailed MC strats and I'm in the corner like "I remember there was a guy in the Deadmines, Van something or other?"
---
A bit of both. Trying to get to 60 quickly but not speedrunning. Will run dungeons and stuff with friends, maybe do some PvP.
---
Because it's still better than retail WoW unforunately. Once Classic is out, I don't think I'll touch Twitch ever again, besides Asmongold, who is still great and a lovely guy.
---
It's kinda obvious that only shills will get access to avoid negative feedback on intentional mistakes on activisions part
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgV6Gk7LfK4
---
I hope there's plenty of manure in there.
---
LOL are you serious? I'd say NM raid now is on the dificult of vanilla raid. The dificulty was on the attun, on getting 40 people online. You cant compare vanilla raid with mythic raiding now. Not even a fucking chance.
---
Troll racial. Increases all damage done to beasts by 5%, that counts for all mobs, raid bosses, hunter pets and druids when they are in bear/cat/travel form.
---
Say you have 4 friends and there are three active layers, you manage to have one friend on each layer.
---
You find a black lotus spawn on layer 1 and pick it, group with friend on layer 2 and pick it, group with friend on layer 3 and pick it, group back with friend on layer 1.
---
People will figure out how to exploit the layer hopping system and horde resources as a result.
---
I was lucky enough to catch this stream live and it had me cracking up.
---
Never bring tips out to a 5 man with a Druid healer unless you wanna wait all day for him to corpse run lol
---
yeah i ld personally prefer female tauren to female druid
---
Well I played on the most popular ones on the past few years and yes there are tons of poor pack pulls and tons of areas with mobs just standing still where they appear to be patting on classic servers now
---
as a belf main, absolutely not
---
Possibly. It's going to be GLORIOUS
---
Link me the official source then. This guy explicitly says that he got in with no active subscription.
---
https://twitter.com/barrens_chat_/status/1128787099350634497?s=19
---
A few have not had subscriptions like Teebs. But teebs is a content creator I assume.
---
I've never watched a stream until last night when he was leveling with Esfand.  It was pretty entertaining.  But goddamn if I don't understand the Twitch-speak in the chat room.  The the hell does "Pog" mean?  Every second someone was saying that
---
Why do you think they will be all spawned at the same time across all layers?
---
Guardian??
---
Ima go feral for leveling, tanking dungeons as I level. HotW/NS at 60 to tank 5 mans and heal raids.
---
I remember running UBRS a ton even fairly close to TBC release.  But I was fairly ‚Äú casual ‚Äú and not a main raid healer for the guild I was in at the time.  UBRS was a good time though.
---
So envious, I wish I had friends to do this with. My two friends I used to play this with are in jail lol.
---
This clown was complaining that leveling in vanilla is too hard yesterday. Lmfao
---
It only costs 5$ to sub though, where are you getting this extra dollar from?
---
They have explicitly said you must have a subscription as of today. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone who isn‚Äôt a content creator get access without a sub.

I see this come up a lot, but vanilla wow never used vertical minus scaling. It used a fixed FoV no matter what aspect ratio was used. If you switched to a wider aspect ratio, it would chop off from the top and bottom, but you would also gain some on the sides. The link in the OP's post is just flat out wrong - vanilla wow never worked that way. There was never anything "wrong" with it that needed "fixing" (these players just preferred a bigger FoV)
---
With WotLK Horizontal-plus scaling was introduced, PLUS there was a flat out FoV increase to all aspect ratios. The larger FoV in modern WoW (and therefore classic) is simply a larger FoV - it's nothing to do with fixing an incorrect scaling method.
---
But yes I totally agree with you, the earlier narrower FoV was superior IMO and I would want that to be included to fully replicate classic.
---
Yeah that would be ideal, I really hope we do get a slider for it.
---
You shouldn't be able to compete for the resources of another map at all. Also, 2-3k is nothing compared to the competition they've had to deal with on the latest private server projects with 10k+ population. So if you split that team up they'll still do fine across multiple layers. Plus the ability to dynamically teleport reinforcements (who are already in that zone, mind you) directly on top of fights. It's just stupid.. 
---
Not to mention other types of limited nodes, etc. where you can just hop between layers to check for the respawn. The first people on the server will have access to that abuse regardless.
---
I remember the day rain was implemented in a patch and I was wowd by how insane it was. It was this intense back then for sure.
---
But what about female tauren druid?
---
wut
---
&gt; small part
---
I don't think you know how different the architecture is between now and then. The blizzcon classic panel gave some great insight into how much work needed to be done to get the retail client to talk classic data.
---
I just got home, logged in and I see that I've been invited. Nice.
---
I've had a concurrent subscription since november 27th 2004 and I've participated in a few closed betas for Blizz, with WoW being one of them. Just FYI
---
I didn't get in. Fuck Blizzard.
---
Did you get an email or just refresh your launcher?
---
This is exactly how it was!
---
Except layering does not fix the starter zone issues, we will still have 500-900 people in each starter zone without dynamic respawns.
---
Do you know how to force it? Not necessarily the ratio but the field of view?

Or maybe even "You think you want classic, but you don't."

Lol no, the partner and affiliate is a different position as a streamer. Not two separate people
---
If you feel like giving it a listen, all the OST's are on the various music streaming platforms.

Taking my time and PvPing along the way.

Yeah I didn't get an email or anything but i had to log out and then log back into the bnet launcher and it appeared.

So do you have to be subbed for the invite or no?

Interesting

Anyone know when the next beta invites roll out?

Will i see a seperate game called "wow classic" or something similar in my launcher to know i got invited? or do i have to install the regular version and try something

For real man. I am right there with ya.

The god damn gauntlet you had to do for the quest chain in there. I still get nightmares years later.

Glad they cleared it up! I didn‚Äôt see the post today. Do you have a link?

I just got mine, too.  Account created December 2004.  I have an active subscription 
---
I looked because I saw "World of Warcraft¬Æ: Legion (WoW7) Public Test Realm" in my battle.net account.  No email.
---
Thanks, I was not aware that each class got a different pvp trink.
---
Imagine thinking there aren't other factors for the *automated invite process*.
---
WTF WHERE IS MINE BLIZZARD WTF I PRESS CHURGES
---
Yup, just got in.
---
Wait a minute.. tipsout actually never played vanilla when it was live?
---
Whether they are or aren't, it still gives a player 3 chances of finding a resource per node spawn point. That is something that players will find ways to exploit.

Account created just after Christmas in 2004(rolled my first character and still my main like..the 26th or 27th(, was pretty steady in vanilla but have been off and on again a subscriber since TBC (My wife and I always take breaks for a few months every expansion, we just came back about a month ago)
---
She didn't get one I don't think, and her account is about 5-6 months newer than mine. (we actually met in wow)
---
I've never actually gotten into a beta for WoW. Other games of theirs, but not a wow expansion (the annual pass beta doesn't count imo). So this is kinda exciting
---
It‚Äôs kinda dumb, but you would say Pog if something was achieved, For ex. Getting a green sword or whatever
---
I cracked up when I saw that, I hope Blizz close his bug report with a "git gud scrub"
---
Someone posted they got one without sub and can paly without sub
---
yeah just refreshed and got in ty for posting.  dec 2004 acct, subbed 2004-2014, skipped all of wod and legion and have been subbed entired bfa if anyone is trying to decipher a pattern
---
You think you want to be wet, but you dont.
---
restarted the launcher
---
And nothing.
---
Account from 11-23-04
---
That's because they are a content creator
---
Sweet, well now if I don't get it over the next 48 hours I still have hope.
---
December 2004
---
guardian is the tank aspect of the Feral spec.
---
I have 2 guildies with F&amp;F, neither got invites despite being vanilla accs with active subs.
---
Plan a talent build with  good survivability 
---
Plan a leveling route that has upgrades in mind / allows you to do the dungeons you want
---
Find friends with a similar schedule for duo leveling and pick chars that compliment eachother (i guesss this would be first. 
---
GOD TIER is lock pally. Double mage is good 
---
fastest leveler is currently a mage.
---
I'm painfully aware, since all those years give me a degree that's considered the same as a 5 year one now that I'm working abroad. Just saying that there's more exceptions out there than doctors and PhDs...
---
I think the reason they went with layering instead of server merging is that you still have a chance to play with each and everyone with layering but if it were different realms then you would be introduced to completely new people that you haven't had a chance to play with.
---
Instead of having 3000 people in competition for 1 set of resources you‚Äôll have 9000 people in competition for 3 sets of resources. We also have no information on whether or not there will be cooldowns to go between layers or anything of that nature. Since after all the intent of layers is to make sure friends and guilds can stay together, it would make a lot of sense if they made layers semi-permanent. I don‚Äôt even think blizzard knows this information yet themselves, though, to be honest. I believe that if they see people exploiting this they will implement something to solve it.
---
Yep, I saw a wow5 PTR(which is funny since I already have a wow5 starter account on my battle.net profile)
---
Checked the launcher and voila
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj2ftj2OKVw
---
Not in vanilla it ain't.
---
They are lying. Blizzard specifically said you need a sub to be invited to the beta.
---
I‚Äôm starting to think you‚Äôre right :).
---
Got any links?
---
This is prob not helpful but I have played Pservers for about 5 years I already know my class/ Bis and leveling routes and expected playtime for each level so I‚Äôm excited to see how different it will be on live with the mob armor values correct.

Do people honestly think that I would make this claim without concrete sources?

Can't wait to terrorize redridge
---
Probably a content creator
---
There was another wave today around 6pm EST.  I think they might still be going out.  Check your launcher before you check your email.
---
I think they are doing them daily, small batches at a time.
---
Haha, I see that. I don‚Äôt really understand the dislike. Surely a healthier Classic means a healthier retail?
---
There will be A LOT more than 2 or 3 layers.
---
Do they make youtube vids or stream?
---
It‚Äôs always more of a Venn diagram than a 50/50 poll.
---
Classic isn't out yet.
---
I think as long as as it's client side and optional, all sides should be Happy
---
I was, it was my first year. Another first year teacher also got the boot.
---
Well I see heavy hate on this this subreddit about retail. I still didnt read sing 1 comment  hating classic but here I've read yours and several ones calling the retail subreddit as "salty, triggered". Mabye goes aas both ways, I guess.
---
Entry level raid positions will requires 5 years previous experience, at least a 4 year degree in STEM (Preferably Conputer science or Mathematics for min/maxing) with copies of transcripts, at least 3 non-family or friends references (which will be called to verify), resume WITH cover letter and proof of health insurance.
---
There is no official source from Blizzard that says that. The original statement says you need a subscription to *participate*, meaning once you're accepted you have to sub to play the beta.
---
On my 8700k it uses around 0.2% CPU and 22MB ram, and it uses about 10% of my 980ti but that's only when the background is actually showing.
---
Yes. You need an active subscription to participate and log into the beta. You do not need one to be invited, as evidenced by the many people who have been invited without a subscription.

---
Probably a ploy to get less people to sub
---
I've been hoping to see an answer for this too. Been watching all the beta invite threads to see if anyone mentions getting an invite without being subbed but haven't seen anything yet. I'd sub if I got an invite, but I won't sub just for the chance of an invite
---
What in the fuck.
---
Asmongold, you genius little piece of shit. I'm not even mad.
---
So that says "participants will need to have an active subscription." I can see that having two interpretations. First one was my initial thought: that you need a sub to get an invite. But it can be interpreted that in order to play the beta after invite you need an active sub. It doesn't explicitly say "to receive an invite you need an active sub"
---
No. Maybe someone will make an addon for it eventually.
---
He's a warrior main not a tank main. 
---
I started playing on a pserver recently and it's amazing how many times you can join a group that's looking for a tank and it'll already have 2 warriors and a druid in it.
---
Unfortunately there isn't a way to change the FoV outside of hacking the client (which is how the private server "fixes" do it).
---
I would like a toggle as well, but in all honesty I can't see Blizzard implementing this for classic.
---
I got an invite!! Resubbed after the beta announcement, started my account in dec 2004. My husband who has almost the exact same account history as me did not get one however. 
---
See you guys in there!
---
It's amazing in wsg and ab flag guarding. In wpvp you can also eat and drink while shadowmelded.
---
It's almost like they said they didn't have a lot to go on to start with when they announced classic. I'm allowed to have an opinion guy, be a dick elsewhere.

WoW Classic survival tip # 24
---
Carry spare panties to Wetlands.
---
Towelliee is a complete POS, I remember watching him in Legion just when the news about Nostalrius admins visiting Blizzard and he was shitting all over people who wanted vanilla with "who wants this" and crapping all over private server players.
---
Now he's "hype"
---
I'm assuming you had an active subscription?
---
Honestly I doubt blizz will give any stock to his reports. He‚Äôs just been invited to get more publicity and advertising for the game. Everyone knows this (except maybe his moronic viewers).
---
Minmaxing (IMO) isn't really realistic, watching Asmon, Esfand, Staysafe and Soda they all started trying to rush and then the vanilla world ended up slowing them down and enjoying the ride. Honestly minmaxing to the fullest potential is something that 0.000000000001% of the playerbase will manage to do properly, the world is too unpredictable.
---
&gt;  I just want to know if I should spend the 15 bucks or not. 
---
if u want a miniscule chance at getting into a maxlevel 30 beta, go ahead.  
---
If 15 bucks arent easy money for you and you would be disappointed if u didnt get it, dont.
---
Not that I've heard, and I sure as heck haven't gotten one (and haven't had an active sub for months).
---
\&gt;What is a "black voice" though?
---
Generally when people talk about "black voice" they're talking about [African-American Vernacular English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) (AAVE).
---
\&gt; There is nothing genetic about the dialect an American black person speaks with 
---
Right, and I don't think anyone here suggested otherwise. I don't see how dialects being cultural rather than genetic is relevant here?
---
\&gt; (nothing in the video suggests the player is white) 
---
Sure, but there are things [outside of the video that do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeroy_Jenkins).
---
\&gt; If anything it does more to reveal ones own racist tendencies and world view. 
---
Ah, the old "talking about racism means you're racist" argument, I was wondering when this would show up.
---
it's still super hyped at the moment, it won't be #1 on twitch (at least consistently) when we are 2+ months after release I think, will still be played a lot though.
---
"you think you want classic wow but you don't"
---
still nothing on my end :( my account is from ‚Äò07/‚Äò08

Weird so desnt say beta:world of warcraft classic for you?

Nah. You were probably much higher level than you think. No way there‚Äôs enough mana to 2 man that unless you used glitches

some podcasters twittered that their viewers got in without sub...

Perhaps he also respected it more on pservers and didn‚Äôt have broken armor and his healer was paying attention too.

**African-American Vernacular English**
---
African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), known less precisely as Black Vernacular, Black English Vernacular (BEV), Black Vernacular English (BVE) or colloquially Ebonics (a controversial term), is the variety (dialect, ethnolect and sociolect) of English natively spoken by most working- and middle-class African Americans and some Black Canadians, particularly in urban communities.Having its own unique grammatical, vocabulary and accent features, African-American Vernacular English is employed by middle-class African Americans as the more informal and casual end of a sociolinguistic continuum; on the formal end of this continuum, middle-class African-Americans switch to more standard English grammar and vocabulary, usually while retaining elements of the nonstandard accent.As with most African-American English, African-American Vernacular English shares a large portion of its grammar and phonology with the rural dialects of the Southern United States, and especially older Southern American English, due to historical connections to the region. 
---
Mainstream linguists maintain that the parallels between African-American Vernacular English and West African and English-based creole languages are real but minor, with African-American Vernacular English genealogically still falling under the English language, demonstrably tracing back to the diverse nonstandard dialects of early English settlers in the Southern United States.However, a minority of linguists argue that the vernacular shares so many characteristics with African creole languages spoken around the world that it could have originated as its own English-based creole or semi-creole language, distinct from the English language, before undergoing a process of decreolization.

**Leeroy Jenkins**
---
Leeroy Jenkins is a character name for a player character created by Ben Schulz in Blizzard Entertainment's MMORPG World of Warcraft. The character became popular due to his role in a video which became an Internet meme. Knowledge of the video has spread beyond the game's community and into other online and mainstream media.

1. You can level as holy or ret, they're both going to be slow but you wont die
---
2. Unless you're a dedicated progression raider you can get away with a hybrid build
---
3. Not sure what you mean
---
play night elf, you can meld to disappear when you need to afk without dying, plus when you die, you get back faster due to wisp. Also rogue or hunter can help. If you dont have a lot of time, dont play warrior
---
It's really not
---
NO TALENT TREE??? WTF
---
I hope this is what they do. Nothing better than a fresh start.
---
How could ou possibly know the chat will be linked?
---
It‚Äôs more likely they aren‚Äôt linked because each layer is 3000 people.
---
The Alliance built half a dozen castles in remote parts of the world while their capital city didn't even get a railing around the gaping hole that was Stormwind's park.
---
Woo, that gives me hope that I will be-able to get in since I didn't start in 2004 or 2005.
---
Blizzard said really early (like soon after announcement) on that they had to rewrite the the backend due to how badly it aged.  
---
That's no just server side change alone, but would require changes to the source code of WoW too.
---
3 layers is 9000 people on 1 sever, it‚Äôs highly unlikely there will be more than that.
---
Yeah.  When I saw the updated SC I was trying to figure out for a few minutes on whether this was the old or new one, honestly wasn't sure.  Then I saw a pic of the old one....
---
I get the classic hype and nostalgia, really, but no, classic won't do anything to retail wow.
---
It will be massive at launch, millions will try, but let's be real here, how many will get past the absolute horror that was classic leveling ? Pretty much every single class spends its first 30 hours into the game right-clicking monsters, with nothing but grey items.
---
??
---
Have you been watching streams at all? Minmaxing by definition means minimal fuck ups, watching staysafe get crit and dying or falling off a hill and fucking up his run is not minmaxing to the fullest
---
I feel like I'm in /bg right now
---
I work in customer support. A CS agent misreading info the same way we might have is EXTREMELY likely. You have no idea how often i have to correct t1 agents about policies or how to interpret a policy.
---
no this is just a picture icon for discord, nothing in wow
---
Several people have claimed they have been invited without a sub, but they have needed a sub to play.
---
funny thing is that staysafe‚Äôs attempt at racing to 30 is going horribly. Hilarious to see all these ‚Äúvanilla experts‚Äù actually suck at the game the first time they‚Äôre allowed to actually stream themselves playing it. Actually good players will soak up their viewers soon once the game
---
is released and good/bad players are exposed. Hope these guys (tips, staysafe, esfand) are enjoying their 15 minutes. 
---
The funniest part is that they think they‚Äôll be leading hardcore competitive raiding guilds. Good thing for them difficult content won‚Äôt be out for like a year.
---
This one seems to have invited a good chunk of F/F people. 
---
Fun fact: You dont need to restart your launcher. I randomly decided to look (after checking a couple hours ago) after someone told me a wave was going out soon and it was there. No restart required. https://i.imgur.com/nwbSSUw.png
---
Do everyone a favor and play the game and have fun. If your going to shit on someone for trying to get exp and gear. 1 WC run doing the quest is almost 2 levels. Try just not doing that
---
Pretty much my experience with Vanilla the first time around - we would raid for three or four hours, three or four times a week, but didn't require flasks/enchants/buffs/etc. Raider performance/log analysis wasn't really monitored, and theorycrafting was a thing that only one or two people in the guild did so most raiders thought "hit cap" was something you would put on in order to get punched.
---
We still managed to clear Ony/MC/ZG/BWL/AQ20 regularly, with progress into AQ40. Naxx was a distant dream because only about 10 or 15 raiders had actually completed the attunement.
---
I can't wait to do it all again in Classic.
---
Thanks for taking the time to write all that out
---
considering watching someone playing classic is mind numbing boring, i agree. it does confirm a big interest from the mainstream though
---
I‚Äôm also going to roll opposite and enjoy ganking these clowns on stream. Can‚Äôt wait for some world pvp wars.
---
Can stay 30/0/21,ull be half a Raid healer but still decent
---
If Blizzard want to make an uber realistic WoW Classic option that runs at 30fps on a pair of 2080 Tis, it's their call. \*I\* think it's a waste, but it's not my game. But the people saying "omg it's 2019 ofc there'll be updates it's already done in bfa get over yourself"... they annoy me. Because they're stupid, yet they think they're smart, and they make a lot of noise.
---
They seem to believe that Classic is just this spinoff from retail and wouldn't it be cool if we had A, B and C from BfA but X, Y and Z from Vanilla. Even though Blizzard have been very clear that this is a recreation project, heavily inspired by the success of pservers, and retail with its expansions are the main course for those looking ahead.
---
For now at least. If by some miracle Classic turns out to be more popular than BfA then I wouldn't put it past Activision to push for more eye candy and monetization. Right now though, I have to assume that anyone saying that Classic will have a "BfA graphics" mode is either hare brained or a troll.
---
So with your logic, everyone should use the same graphic setting, same monitor size, same game setting, same addons, etc. Because Otherwise it's against the shard world?
---
Same I checked it at 5pm no beta, checked it again after reading this at 6pm and beta was there.
---
Lmao.

DM.  You ran DM.  VC is the name of the boss.  The dungeon's name is Deadmines.
---
You‚Äôre confused. Layering has virtually nothing to do with sharding. It has nothing to do with getting cactus apples. It‚Äôs a way for them to not have to launch with a lot of servers and potentially run into dead servers. It is a big deal. You‚Äôre wrong.
---
They sending them out like every hour calm tf down
---
Streamer quarantine server is a great idea.
---
battle.net just says wow5 legion public test realm (when I already had a wow1 PTR), launcher says classic though.
---
That would be dope. But also have the choice to restart your character fresh or move onto a BC server and start doing Outland
---
In the extremely unlikely and hyperbolic situation that more than a few people are 60 before layering is removed in p2 it‚Äôs going to be incredibly hard to abuse. Most servers will only have 1-2 3000 person layers.
---
&gt; I am killing a mob and you are attacking me?!!!
---
Lol, I feel like these softies from retails are not prepared for the kind of wpvp that existed in classic.

i got in this wave - i'm on a f&amp;f list, which i'm sure is why i was selected
---
I got in as well. Been playing since December 2004, so pretty much since the beginning.
---
Found out I got into the classic Beta! Thought I didn‚Äôt since I didn‚Äôt see it until now!
---
For those who got in, have fun and enjoy! For the rest of us, GG.
---
holy shit there are gonna be so many bugs. I realize that‚Äôs what beta is for but I can see why they pained release to end of august. They‚Äôre gonna have to increase the level cap to 60 soon if they wanna get all the bugs though. Playing sub level 30 is only going to give a fraction of the information they need. We‚Äôll also need testing for later content stages, I guess they‚Äôll do PTRs?
---
&gt;&gt;And nothing
---
&gt;From 01-25-1992
---
I saw a random post/comment about having to have your PTR account set up to get in, any truth to it? I've gotten into many betas and havent done PTR in years.
---
Perplexity and his gang are elite players in the game and they are interested in pushing the boundaries of the game. Because they are challenge each other so much in PvP, they really know the game's mechanics inside out. I think people like them are great for beta testing. Same for Joana. You really do want these guys to flesh out bugs because that's what they'll be testing for.
---
Other streamers are more about the entertainment value. I think in game development, you want those guys to give you feedback on how to design the game to be more rewarding or enjoyable.
---
Lemme get out of Darnassus/Teldrasil and i think i can get a screenshot to compare.

Can‚Äôt be giving out usernames like that. People gonna make characters w them now just to spite you :/

Ah dam ok ty for confirming that
---
Skorch is now level 28
---
I remember level 20 being this wall for me. I felt like I went pretty quickly 1-20 like within a day or two and then I felt the grind to get 1 level a day. Then 49 was this other huge wall I remember. Like I had two major shifts in how approached leveling at those two levels. But that‚Äôs all so vague. It‚Äôs only what I recall.
---
&gt; female tauren is considered the worst looking horde race
---
By people clearly possessing what can be charitably described as suspect taste.
---
I'm (mostly) joking, of course. Frankly, I'm all for most people thinking female tauren are ugly and thus staying away from them. Means my own cow-babes will be that much more noticeable.
---
Are you kidding me. This list is nothing. There are thousands of obvious issues.
---
Perfect.
---
They only got three characters to make before launch and gotta pick the same server as me. I wish them luck.
---
They made a claim that i was wrong.
---
I stated information that was discussed long ago.
---
Too many people these days have used private server knowledge in their rankings and such.
---
I actually used to do power leveling back in the day...and me and all my friends found that druids were the best behind hunters. Then warlocks - priests and yada yada warriors last.
---
What other proof do i need? You claim im just talking out of my ass? Then prove i am. But dont use information from private servers (which has been proven to be bullshit and i even worked on my own private servers so i know this for a fact) is bullshit and almost all of it is incorrect to some degree. This isnt a shitty emulation we will be playing. Sorry.
---
There's female tauren?
---
Dude, I‚Äôve tried. You can‚Äôt explain shit to these guys. They still think layering and an evolution to sharding. We have to accept that they are confused and blinded by blizzards pubes in their eyes. Of course we will see their complaining in 6 months when their layered server gets collapsed with 20k people on and chat is impossible to read, the aq event is completed in 10 seconds, alts will never be leveled because of hundreds of gankers, community will dwindle because instead of being a small fish in a medium pond, you‚Äôre a small fish in Tokyo city, friends lists of guilds in other layers offering invites for gold to get resources, world bosses potentially (debuff for Kazan and azuregos could be impossible still) zerged down by thousands, getting into instances impossible because server population is 5x what it should be, etc. 
---
Just grab some popcorn and watch them eat their words brother.
---
Lol, yeah, talent trees have been gone for a few xpacs now, many of the class abilities have been stripped, and there are no hybrids anymore. Talents exist, but it's basically a choice between 3 abilities or passives every 15 levels or so. No trees.
---
I started college degree #2 just before classic was announced, then my husband decided that he wanted a career change, too. So we're both going to be students when classic launches, just like old times.
---
kek
---
Some of us still do! (Even on non RP severs)
---
Look at the sidebar, buddy. Not only is the subreddit discord linked, but so is the weekly LFG thread.
---
Imagine being a TipsOut shill, what a sad and pointless existence.
---
I‚Äôve seen conflicting answers. I know it‚Äôs active sub to play, but is it active sub for a chance at the invite email too? Or could I see the email and decide if I want to sub to play it
---
Hehe Subway. Good one :) If you only knew my child.
---
I think it's the 'in school' that people relate to differently though.
---
Like, I was 'back' in school in 2005.  Was in my mid-20s, had already done a few semesters at a University, moved out, supported myself, then joined the military and served a term there by that point.
---
I'm not degrading your experience at all, just from my experience it would be really weird to still be in school now (unless I had a whole lot of degrees).
---
Basically, it feels from my perspective that you're saying the same thing as I would if I said I was in school in 1985...which is true.
---
Couple that with the handy "Kill on Sight List" addon and you never forget to repay the favor.
---
So he's saying we think we do, but we don't?
---
Godspeed all the same
---
You already had it! Appreciate it for what it was and that it had its place in the past.
---
Same here. Vanilla WoW in college. Raiding 3 times a week. PVP server.
---
Now job, family, wife, mortgage, etc. This looks awesome though.
---
I got one, literally 5 minutes after posting in my Discord how I was getting super bummed watching everyone play, thought about taking a youtube/twitch break for a while.
---
Saw "Beta: WoW Classic" in the drop down and thought for sure someone was fucking with me.  The WoW gods smiled upon me this day.
---
We're going home, boys.
---
My god that makes me so happy.
---
Used this guide leveling my last rogue. Some of these are key (quest rewards specifically) to efficient leveling. Definitely worth a save for anyone going rogue at release. 
---
Still torn on what I‚Äôm gonna roll but I‚Äôm about 80% set on rogue.
---
&gt; Its only a fallacy if its unsubstantiated.
---
Also known as the *fallacy fallacy* - just because something can be a fallacy, doesn't mean that it is.  
---
Whether the arguments for/against the fallacy have merit is left as an exercise for the reader.
---
its the exact same as it used to be

I'm so glad WoW didn't come out when I was younger.  I don't think I would have done anything else.
---
yes, i 100% agree! just wanted to share any information i could get :)
---
Yeah it was also commonly called vc on the unofficial oce servers
---
Checking now plsssssssss let me in ):
---
Im afraid to ask what BiS is :S
---
All of those celebrity endorsements just came rushing back to me.
---
"I'M MR T AND I PLAY A NIGHT. ELF. MOHAWK. WHAT'S YOUR GAME?"
---
I got one a little while ago, and for sure did not have one from the first wave. No email received.  I'm a completely irrelevant player with no online presence, not on the F&amp;F list. Have had the game since 11/2004 and pretty continuously subbed since then with small lapses. Have BFA and active sub.
---
I'm not trying to brag, just I know people are dying for details on who is getting invites.
---
The whole point of layering is too limit the server numbers. Otherwise they could just release realms with 6-9k pop cap(Yes their machines can handle it) use starter-zone sharding(Which actually fixes the overcrowding issue, layering does not fix that) and there would be a whole less people whining because it was already expected.
---
Just a cash grab poser trying to make a quick buck off an untapped market
---
Some of his videos are interesting, but they're basically just him recompiling other peoples posts/information in a nice way (such as his "coolest quests" video, etc) 
---
But he's clearly like omegatrash which is funny because this game is really not hard at all
---
Yea that's exactly what I'm thinking, though sometimes when friends aren't on having a stream on a 2nd monitor could be nice.
---
My husband got in.  He has played since launch in 2004 and has a current subscription.
---
I dont remember this effect being in Vanilla, but I do know its on live servers, it occurs as a timed event like thing.
---
Id pay money
---
"No water in deadmines"
---
Well, shit.
---
What does that have to do with my comment?
---
Can I still play retail to buy tokens for my classic sub since the subs are shared?
---
Don't they use instant poison during raids though?
---
retard.
---
I‚Äôve seen there will still be the different types of servers (pvp/pve) but I havnt seen how many different servers there will be. It has to be less than the actual classic
---
Calm down nerd.
---
40 people that turn up every week on time with consumables
---
MC, BWL and Rank 10 are doable for a casual player for sure. Even maybe AQ eventually.
---
RRRRRRRAAAAAAAGGGGEEE
---
What's that got to do with graphics?
---
You think they just pop a few zeroes onto the end of the code and, TADA, Proudmoore's cameltoe is visible in all its glory?
---
It ain't like that, bro.
---
I really hope all these streamers who are playing with each other will continue to play with each other on the same server.
---
But I see this as a huge problem because Blizzard already said they won't be making that many servers for Classic, or at least they want to keep the number as small as possible. And maybe streamers have egos and don't want to share a server with each other? So that means of the few servers available, the streamers will be in pretty much all of them.
---
I just hope the world of Azeroth is big enough for us to be able to ignore what they're doing. I really want an organic and productive trade chat, and I want player created content and storyline to be produced organically.

I'd assume so. Maybe there will be one of each?

Batching is a thing, the sheep and the dmg can land at the same time.
---
You're testing the game, why the fuck would you want to pay to perform a service for them.
---
It's either the coin game from the 90s or "person other than grunt" from the army.
---
McGregor, Tyson, Ali definitely.
---
I got introduced to wow in 06 when i was in elementary school. I am excited to try out old school as an adult.
---
its not even a release, its day two of a beta.
---
I'll never contribute to people who put their political beliefs in the game. We don't need that nonsense. Even if its parody, I feel the game has no room for that.
---
Same, but replace Cata with Pandaland
---
I just got my beta invite. Just logged in! Played in vanilla, I do not stream but did raid hardcore in vanilla. I‚Äôm sure that means nothing though
---
Because money isn't a thing for me.
---
Yeah. Plus its not like the black lotus is just gonna be sitting there not getting gathered. Like the other layer is filled with morons without gathering professions.
---
It has been shown that memories are shaped by what people read and what they want to remember, not necessarily what they actually experienced. Countless studies on the topic, it's a fairly simple concept. Some light Googling should give ya everything you need.
---
Good luck!
---
I wouldn't worry too much about getting the elite hard to find gear on the beta as you won't be keeping these characters
---
That's *Dr.* Tyler to you..........and all of us too.
---
Well for one 25 was supposed to be 25% and I got it from the talent in the talent tree, without a consistent way to get critted and proc enrage (from the talent called enrage) you lose the 25% damage it provides, which is effectively a (well almost) 25% damage loss, literally stated that what the guy said was a fact not an opinion
---
Pretty sure whirlwind axe questline is 30 requirement for the entire questline so that would be by far the best weapon for warriors.
---
Tips and co. (this includes staysafe) finally being exposed. First time they‚Äôre able to actually stream themselves playing the game and it‚Äôs obvious they have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. Hopefully this will give the actually good players who maybe don‚Äôt have fully polished streams yet a chance to grow.
---
you will see a "Classic: Beta" option in the "Region/Account" drop down menu under "World of Warcraft" in the BNet client
---
This is beautiful.
---
How are they charging people for beta.
---
so you're thinking there will be tens of thousands of players per server? Like 40,000?
---
I believe a lot of people would pay for 3 months of beta access - which is exactly why they aren't accepting money for it if they do genuinely want to keep the beta small.
---
Anyone with Active Sub, with a 2004/2005 accounts but WITHOUT BFA gotten in?  (I stopped the charade at Legion)
---
Fucking with your friends is toxic? Okayyy.
---
If you look at this with the understanding that the vast majority of games released don't ever actually hit the front page even on launch, let alone day 2 of a beta, it bodes well. Then factor in dedicated classic wow streamers like asmongold, esfand, staysafe, etc and you have the makings of a longstanding front page presence
---
Yep &gt;.&gt;
---
Westfall, Wetlands, STV, Winterspring, Tanaris.
---
Got ESO to tide me over until Classic.
---
To replicate: be me
---
That's a clue reference to purple
---
&gt; Going to enjoy destroying all the fotm private server kids
---
Private server players are going to be the best classic players for the most part, of highest average skill for a group
---
You think idiots like these retail streamers will be better? Fucking look at them
---
Something old it looks like to me.
---
But how will we win duels if we don‚Äôt!?!?
---
Beta isn‚Äôt early access
---
It's Wildstar all over again.
---
I still try to quote "Don't do it Jimmy!" Hoping someone knows the reference
---
Hell, I still oppose layering/sharding/whatever-they're-calling-it-this-week altogether.
---
WoW's launch in '04 was a shit show, yet it not only survived but thrived.
---
Let Classic's launch be a shit show too, if that's what it's going to be. I'm confident the game will once again not only survive but thrive despite (possibly even because of) that.
---
Adversity builds character and engenders social bonds by those who experience it together. Queues suck, but they suck equally for everyone wanting to play the game. It gives you something to grouse about and another way to make friends to play with later.
---
And before anyone says it, yes, I *do* understand how layering/sharding/whatever-they're-calling-it-this-week works. I also understand why the folks at Blizzard feel they have to Do Something‚Ñ¢ about this "problem" of their own creation.
---
I'm not stupid. I get it. I simply disagree.
---
For horde, Alliance gets a quest 2H axe in Sm that's better, Doesn't look as good though.
---
Got in as well. Got it December 2014 for Christmas. Subbed at least two months every expansion
---
Not if you throw up your divine shield to free the NPC. You'll get killed afterwards, definitely, but as long as you don't release before the NPC gets the door open you can run back and get to the hammer while skipping the first boss.
---
Makes sense, the numbers were super low today, but still high enough to have to wait for mob spawns.
---
When I went to Org there were only two other people there.
---
TBH I think we'll be too busy playing the game to pick through reddit threads, and I'm okay with that.
---
Damn, I don't recall that kind of weather but it's awesome. Granted, back then we were running like AMD Phenoms and were laggy, so always turned our settings down.
---
what is irony?
---
Beta isn't for you to play and enjoy "early access". It's supposed to be a bug hunt.
---
Depends on what you're trying to do, what level are the dungeons etc
---
I gotta say that this sub has become extremely cancerous over the last week.
---
Can‚Äôt wait till the game is here so everyone can worry about that.
---
WidePeepoHappy
---
hahahaha these clowns
---
Blizzard learned their lesson with the MoP beta where you could buy access, it's a total overcrowded shitshow.
---
This is a corporation at the end of the day. They have market researchers and such who work there.
---
Woo just got in! Being playing since the original WoW Beta and subbed since day 1 (on and off after Wrath came out).
---
You‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with the gaming industry
---
I have a Tauren Druid that‚Äôs named eatmorehumanz!
---
Damn, my friend must have removed me and not sure how to go about asking hahaha. Oh well, August ain‚Äôt too far.
---
yeah, to be honest if the price was right I'd definitely pay for 3 months of beta access. I'd even still test for them, in terms of reporting bugs and spending time looking for exploits. I agree with you that they are very purposefully not doing that
---
Old people commenting about twitch WutFace
---
Yeah I definitely remember the coin game from the 90s
---
Variation of the PogChamp emote, basically expresses huge excitement/shock like "Holy shit" for example.
---
If you try to play on any private server it will require you to download the 1.12 client to play. Get your head out of your ass.
---
No mounts no gear
---
Something new? We‚Äôve all ran deadmines. I know deadmines like the back of my hand.
---
Can‚Äôt you login to BFA right now and run deadmines?
---
That has nothing to do with the client.
---
Oh no please don‚Äôt let this become an artposts sub like r/wow.
---
LOL. Okay. That explains the mass advertisement of the last 24 hours. Seriously, do you guys even think before you post?
---
Quest for Bonebiter needs at least lvl 35 I think, no way you can get it at 30 even if you could somehow clear SM at lvl 30 lol (hint: you can't).
---
I just figured there will always be try hards. Just look at the private servers.  Many of them will shut down come August and the communities are still thriving.
---
In this case, "Pog" is the shortened version of the Twitch Emote "PogChamp", which shows a young man with a mouth opened in excitement. The (custom) emote "Pog" just shows the open mouth.
---
My secret: roll a priest, get invited even while undergeared. Back in the day we had a number of priests who only showed up once a week. There just weren't enough priests available to be picky about attendance. We got up to Twin Emperors in AQ40, and downed a couple of bosses in Naxx with probably 10 once-a-week-ers in each raid. The guild raided about three times a week, and we had some people who had 100% attendance, but nowhere near 40 of those people.
---
Other healers or a mage might be able to pull that off, too.
---
[Fiery Recipe](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11207) drops in BRD and requires 265enchanting. Just figured you'd like to know.
---
I believe they commented on it in one of the interviews. Per chance I‚Äôm mistaken, there would absolutely be a way to communicate cross layer. Why would they go into detail about guilds being defaulted to certain layers if everyone‚Äôs defaulted to one anyways?
---
$10k+ I think. Where did I go wrong in my life.
---
Inaccuracies, I dunno, its not reverse engineered, they had a copy.  it is true to form.
---
I was interested in hearing the out-of-touch 60 year old Boomer perspective. Thanks for chiming in.
---
Classic WoW source code and server configuration is very similar to that of Retail WoW. That means it's very easy to get it to support many of the newest functionalities, the one this thread is focused on is the updated graphics.  
---
&gt; You think they just pop a few zeroes onto the end of the code and, TADA, Proudmoore's cameltoe is visible in all its glory?
---
Actually, it's very likely just involves loading a inhouse graphics library. Than coding the option for players to enable it. 
---
So yes, it is like that bro.
---
If i ever go back to Westfall... i may never want to leave again....
---
I mean between twitch chat, YouTube comments, and reddit, I‚Äôd take reddit any day of the year
---
Yeah totally
---
goodluck killing the level 38/39 elemental mobs at level 30 for the quest
---
Agree. 100%
---
It'll be funny to see what the highest level instance they can clear will be, assuming they're all open. I'd imagine Gnomer and SM Library would be pretty straightforward in some decent gear at lvl 30, and probably SM Library. SM Armory sounds very hard with a lvl 30 tank.
---
Oh there will be.
---
it wasn't always this way, the evolution of this sub has been interesting to say the least.
---
Depends on the streamer tbh. Most big streamers are indeed surrounded by toxicity, or putting a show on. Pogs and pepe's and shit.
---
But, say for example; if Cohh streamed WoW. His community is built on different foundations. Most of them are respectable people. 
---
Just depends on the crowd they bring.
---
Take your pills and lay down grandpa.
---
you're 100% right but that's why their streamers and not Instagram models.
---
If you're from the Oceanic region this is exactly the sort of guild I am going to be running. Raids 1-2 times a week and casual dungeons and PvP the rest of the time when/if people are available.
---
Sitting around and watching some wanker play games is pants-on-head retarded to begin with.
---
Pepega
---
why would you review games you didnt play.
---
I just spent $4 to upgrade to first class seating on this hype train.
---
People give way too much credit to these streamers. They are if anything, private server experts not vanilla experts. This fight is simple if you aren‚Äôt dpsing as a healer, have mana, and don‚Äôt have your character screen open covering your party frames.
---
I watched it also and was thoroughly entertaining. They were constantly asking, ‚Äúwhere the fuck do we go? Where is this guy?‚Äù Which is what MMORPGs are. This day and age it‚Äôs get a quest, run over to the big circle on your map and kill the guy. No running around lost....nothing.
---
It‚Äôs frustrating at times but causes interaction with each other.
---
Best intersexual sucking
---
I‚Äôd personally go with mages for quality of life.
---
1. Raids prefer more caster dps spots over hunters.
---
2. More bag space because you don‚Äôt have to worry about arrows
---
3. You make your own food and water
---
4. Can aoe farm like a mad man.
---
No one cares
---
idk man google it
---
this is one of those legion/bfa client core problems that I am very worried isn't going to get fixed.
---
Yeah they changed it from 60 to provide players with a more authentic experience as a harken back to the orginial beta in 2003 and 2004 when the max level was 30
---
"Early access" means to the REAL game. Of which this isn't.  I would ask if you do, but you all ready answered that with your post.
---
Sort by controversial...it‚Äôs right there for you to read. People making excuses for the streams numbers. Are you blind or just a bad actor?
---
Oh yeah you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs in ‚Äúopen‚Äù beta for anyone who has a lot of viewers on twitch.
---
The bar for my guild was level 60.  Eventually we would complain if someone had a green item.
---
Can I get a vod of scum Tipsout reporting a bug because he can‚Äôt play a 15 yo game? I want a good laugh
---
Right there with you
---
Bought a token via gold and played for 2 or 3 days. Got a beta invite yesterday.
---
I was here when this man predicted the future. All hail our prophet.
---
definitely...
---
There is a release date set, and on the site that they have that on, there are specified times for timezones that they seem to be releasing for, one of which is aest, so it looks promising.
---
Or cause them to roll their fucking eyes. LOL
---
Most kids under 20 have no clue what WoW is. I had to educate my bro in law who is 17 on what WoW is.
---
My 13 yr old nephew couldn‚Äôt even comprehend MMOs.
---
Yes but the point we're trying to make is that this something "new" is actually a 14 year old game that people still aren't sure will do well, meanwhile its showing promise to do very well.
---
That would have been a good idea!  ..But you are going to get roasted for suggesting changes around here - these people are bloodthirsty - quick shadowmend!!
---
not sure this really fits the subreddit but alright
---
Regardless, this is WoW/blizzard we're talking about. Anything they do, especially in relation to the warcraft universe, usually has a massive reception in the beginning at the very least. 
---
Don't get me wrong, i want classic to succeed as much as anybody, but time will only tell whether it's only moderately successful or if it overtakes retail completely.
---
as a female player since vanilla, I can speak from experience and say that you will not be hit on if you play a female tree cow &lt;3
---
They would be ok in a group of 5. The trick would be the final elite. You'd need a raid of 30s in support.
---
But the fire burns them all away.
---
I used to have a Tauren Druid named DyslexicCow so that I could announce "OOM!"
---
I want to see the weird ass world of 85+ talent points and the epic hybrids it could result in
---
&gt; If someone wipes out of spite, then yeh it's a kick. 
---
I'm talking about spotting the type before they do it. If they are impatient, touchy, balk at taking directions, can't stop running in circles or jumping on the spot, you know they are going to be more trouble than they are worth. If you don't kick them straight away you will regret it later.
---
&gt; I was talking mainly just about a bad player like someone who sucks at CC or damage. In Vanilla, the goal is to help those people, not like retail where you curse at them and kick them from group.
---
I agree, it's more like a three strikes policy for that kind of stuff, especially in RFC/WC where people are new.
---
I was responding to the comment that inferred if it was Nax or AQ40 it would have been any different. Not really sure how I missed the point.
---
What do you mean if everyone is defaulted to one?
---
Maybe this will help you?
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/](https://classicdb.ch/)
---
Pepe didn't start as an alt-right meme, he was co-opted by them. Some people refuse to allow that misuse to define their meme usage.
---
Because you obviously don't understand why they have layering in the first place, they have it because they are expecting a massive decline in players once the initial "tourists" are done. So their solution is few server with many layers, tourists go away, layers go down and then they merge. If they only had 2-3 layers per server they might as well just release servers with a population cap of 6-9k.
---
They did this once. 
---
I think it was MOP. If you pre ordered the game or bought a Blizzcon ticket you got beta access. 
---
It was horrible
---
yes
---
I also think they keep saying person other than grunt. I‚Äôm like, what does that have to do with here? Are warriors the grunts?
---
I would imagine, unless there was some gamebreaking bug, nothing regarding balance would change.
---
Its an emote that OP couldn't see because they didn't have the browser extension for it.
---
I wouldn't say amazing. You can use it but really it's very similar to just hiding behind a building or corner. You don't win wsg or ab by hiding, you win it by fighting. Having an actual useful combat racial like stoneform or hardiness is massively more useful than shadowmeld for that.
---
What kind of breakfast we talking here? Sausage egg and cheese biscuits and grits?
---
So, his damage is actually exactly how I remember it. Is it for anybody else too?
---
For people who know about classic and are already planning to play it, yes, this stream doesn't influence us at all. 
---
But leaving aside, those that are still wondering whatever they should play... the reason for the stream is to spread out WoW classic to completely new audience.
---
So true.  I‚Äôm excited to getting lost during a quest and having to refer to ~~Thottbot~~ Wowhead
---
Either you don't get that he was joking or I don't get that you are joking.
---
I can show you my inbox if you want? There's literally a message above yours in my inbox calling all classic players psychotic.
---
There is a user post on the classic forums with some more good ones:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/beta-issues-observations-list-updated/174040
---
-When res sickness ends you automatically are at full health, instead of increasing max health.
---
-When buffing power word fortitude it increases your health and max health - instead of just max health leaving you with health to heal. (Maybe similar to res sickness) - I'm pretty sure I remember this being reported during the alpha demo, weird to see it hasn't been fixed.
---
-If you click on someone who has find herbs enabled you can see them with that buff (mage had arcane intellect and find herbs).
---
However some other ones on that list are not bugs at all.
---
Also https://vanillawowdb.com ( [This](https://vanillawowdb.com/?spells=11.164.9788) should be what you want. )
---
I don't know how many, just that it doesn't make any sense to have 2-3 layers since they could have put pop cap on that and just use regular starter zone sharding. 
---
My guess would be that they have looked at their previous expansion/game releases and take the data from that to predict the amount of decline in players the following 3-4 weeks after release and then decide the amount of layers from that.
---
They confirmed it on the official release date post I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
A toilet hurricane?
---
Account created launch day vanilla, quit in patch 1.5 or so and came back in cataclysm, on/off but more or less consistent subscriber since then, beta tested BFA
---
No email for beta, just a new option on the launcher dropdown
---
Mages make a lot more sense practically speaking. Controlling and keeping 3 pets happy sounds like a pain, and your aoe/cc is terrible compared to 3x blizzard, 3x nova, 3x poly etc.
---
That doesnt say anything, at all.
---
BFA was rank1 too.
---
New =&gt; top viewers
---
Check back in a week or two.
---
You're right. Got them mixed up. But training adds up if you wanted a mount of another race.
---
&gt; I don't know how many, just that it doesn't make any sense to have 2-3 layers since they could have put pop cap on that and just use regular starter zone sharding.
---
people complained about sharding and that they wanted a full server's worth of people to play with
---
A layer is a full server's worth of people to play with
---
"no, not like that!!!!!"
---
\- complainers
---
Hey!
---
I just declined renewing my contract! It's just an opportunity to find a better district! Good luck to you in the job hunt.
---
On PvE servers, the only faction zones are cities and the rest of the zones are just factionless white.
---
/r/classicwow parroting a sarcastic comment from a streamer. How dense can you be?
---
Just got my invite a few minutes ago - no email, but refreshed my launcher and it was there. 
---
I started playing in December 2004 and have played every xpac - I wonder if they are weighting it towards players with long sub times.
---
What does any of that have to do with communication across layers? You‚Äôre just telling me information I already know that has no relevance to my comment.
---
That's what I thought but I dont think it's that simple. I took a screen shot yesterday which I knew how to post it. But WoW was #1 on twitch but had 40k less viewers than fortnite
---
HE DOESN'T KNOW PepeLaugh
---
Same here, I‚Äôm just limited by playtime. If I could play 20 hours a day, I‚Äôd probably get 60 in the first week, but I‚Äôll take at most 1 day off and most of the time I‚Äôll only get 2-3 chances each night.
---
I‚Äôve seen Krol blade posted for like 500-600g on p servers a couple times. Idk if that has any relevance at all to classic though
---
Jesus Christ I see this comment more times than I see my family. If I had a penny for each time someone said this exact comment...
---
Man this thread will be fun to look at when classic is dead after 6 months. The delusions on this subreddit are fascinating.
---
have they mentioned the mob damage being way nerfed and the hit/miss being way off (atleast early levels?) as well?
---
&gt; The the hell does "Pog" mean?
---
Pog is 'Play Of the Game"
---
essentially shorthand for "oh, this is relavent to my interests" or "good job" or anything remotely related.
---
Wailing Caverns was one of the best leveling dungeons, IMO. Decent spread of gear, the place was sprawling and ominous, and worked well as a culmination of that story in The Barrens. 
---
Can't wait to run it!
---
Yeah, I got a foot water bath thingy and massage thingy but I dont even like how itchy grass is in real life, whats the fucking point of this?
---
Yah he hit hard and I was afraid of it. If you are lower level then ya getting smashed on.
---
It works with spells but at full health the bonus haste is roughly equal to the GCD used to cast it. If it can line it up with taking raid damage or using a dark rune, it can be quite nice
---
Can I watch this anywhere?
---
Unlike Tips, I‚Äôve tanked Verdan many times.
---
Vanilla was hard because players sucked. Watch old videos of early boss kills and notice how many mages you see in T2 spamming frostbolt. Or how many hunters you see in T2.5 just existing. There‚Äôs a reason there are guilds clearing Naxx on private servers in an hour and a half.
---
wtf is even the point of chatting in those kinds of streams. it instantly gets buried and its only spam. i honestly don't understand it.
---
Is this happening with any other displayed sources of rage generation?
---
Nah, 
---
Mayweather, Tyson and Ali
---
HAHAHA!!!
---
Dude, that's fucking epic. Mad props on that.
---
What society is that then?
---
Like Questie or Guides?
---
I think it's not even 1 full level.
---
I wouldnt assume its your country, many of us are vanilla vets that haven't been offered an invite at all, I really do think its just a random grab from the current pool of people opted in.
---
No u
---
No you both
---
Bad actor for sure. Are there supportive people in that thread? For sure, most of them are. But there are a ton of people in that thread who hate everything about classic for no other reason that it threatens the game they love.
---
No, it's like bathing in 6 inches of warm baby jesus cum
---
Persistence servers helps grow community tho.
---
Well think of it this way. Making millions streaming is probably similarly unlikely to making it into the NFL
---
I got invited. The account I'm playing on (subscribed with) is not my original account, but is old enough to have my &lt;username&gt;1 as opposed to WoW1. Same battle.net account though. Was surprised to see it.
---
pog is not a variation of pogchamp emote.
---
pogchamp is the emote to show a reaction to pog
---
That's a great point actually. Although I do think that after release when things like MC start getting streamed that'll also get absolutely insane numbers. You're right though, the nostalgia factor for deadmines is a massive factor I didn't consider.
---
who cares you're been playing since vanilla beta, how many viewers do you have ? /s
---
I see the same but says wow2
---
When you‚Äôre /1 lf1m tank WC I won‚Äôt message you then. Because my back can only carry so much shit.
---
Nah.

The difference is that I absolutely no discernible talents.

This crap was cranked out by a computer in less than five seconds.
---
It's so beautiful.
---
Not really.
---
This is missing a lot of the lower level items that are necessary when you don‚Äôt have any weapon specializations. For instance, Tauren can only use maces. There‚Äôs a level 2 2h mace and a level 4 one worth buying before you can do Fizzsprocket. Then, you use the Goblin Smasher until the Zhovra Axe at ~14. That‚Äôll last you until Crescent Staff.

Ideally I hope they split the servers down two paths, one that's a time capsule of the final phase, and one that's the updated alternative timeline version. 
---
While I do like going down an alternative time line, I think it's fair for those who want pure vanilla to keep having access to what they signed up for initially.
---
+1 for Thottbot reference
---
I just got access tonight and wasn't able to yesterday.
---
I have an 04 account and resubbed, haven't played BFA for about 4 months.
---
He can literally let the tip of his dick hang off his chair and piss into the grass like a dog.
---
That‚Äôs too bad, but hey, at least we‚Äôre getting Classic. Thankfully this is just a minor tweak that at the end of the day, I can live without it.
---
Big boy words if true
---
It‚Äôs entirely more likely there will be no communication between layers as they will be the size of full servers.
---
It basically lowers the chance of people abusing layering and if any of the layers stay close to the intended server population caps they can keep those as individual servers without any effect of the people on them.
---
The path to success is to make player experience the number 1 priority.
---
You know what gets in the way of player experience? layering
---
I agree with cooking, though I always got sad when I got cooking recipes as quest rewards and didn't have the heart to throw them away (as a hoarder/collector of stuff). Was annoying to keep them in my bank lol.
---
But, in defense of fishing, it *can* serve as a moneymaker while leveling. [Check this out.](https://youtu.be/nhSapeZHaVA)
---
Chance wasn‚Äôt prepared when he invited tips to his oarty
---
Yeah I vaguely remember they changed that in the recent years. Beyond that though, it wasn‚Äôt that hard.
---
It sucks so much Mcconnel didn't get in. It's been a hoot though having him in Disc. Was a fun stream. Esfand was at a consistent 8k too which was awesome.
---
All I can say is: Good luck. I know there are several recipes locked behind naxx vendors.
---
I also remember a half dozen or so being super rare drops from elite drakonids.
---
Couldn't have happened to a bigger douchebucket.
---
#WRONG
---
Right.
---
That was the decision while building up the game.
---
As they added content patches and there was more to do and explore they did increase the population caps, and ran into technical limitations.
---
So if we are going into 2006 WOW and not 2004 WOW, we should get 2006 caps, or even the 2006 desired caps if they were limited by technology back then.
---
This is never going to be identical, and it has been stated multiple time that it is about experience more than pixel perfect authenticity.
---
Best dance, imo
---
what he says means shit though.
---
&gt; No, he doesn't seem to care to update them.
---
He‚Äôs working on V3 leveling guides right now actually. He works on them live on stream with his viewers.
---
I've been on Twitch since it came out.
---
It's not worth learning. It's cancer.
---
I am heartened that at least one person got my lame pun.
---
weird guess.
---
Doing a four year degree part time while working full time takes quite a while.
---
More invites are going around. I just got one!!!!
---
softies.... he was joking for the stream, wow classic will be easy as hell just like BFA...
---
You have to have a current retail sub to be eligible for the beta. Kinda makes sense tho.
---
Stop.
---
POG POG POG U GUYS HURRRRRRRRRRRR POGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
---
I just got invited also! Can confirm is legit!!!
---
Thanks, I checked around  1.5 hours ago and wasn't in, checked after reading this and it was there!
---
It‚Äôs not mind numbing to watch. People love to watch twitch to share in something. Wow classic has a huge journey for people to invest in the longer they watch. Plus wow vanilla was the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù game that everyone‚Äôs little sibling would spend hours watching their big sibling play. I think all this is backed up by how widely popular Asmongold was today
---
Show us on the doll where Blizzard hurt you. Did we perhaps get flagged for an offensive name or toxic behavior?
---
Yes. You can use BFA gold to buy WoW tokens and pay for Classic game time.
---
There is no point.
---
4 accounts from vanilla on my battle.net, no invite yet
---
He wasn‚Äôt joking, he was legitimately crying about it.
---
Having classic, combined with all the graphic upgrades would be the literal perfect Wow experience. 
---
I can't understand why they can't have a gfx option to use classic or modern setting. Why nor, because some hardcore classic elitists can't bare the though of a better looking game in 2019? Ridiculous.
---
thanks for the hope, i love being disappointed repeatedly, it's an emotional rollertoaster
---
#üëå
---
kkk (((is bad)))
---
Oh no! A company with stakeholders trying to make money off of their products? Better call the people I choose to pay money to for said product scumbags! Weeeeeeee
---
I feel like the short kid at a fair or some shit who cant reach the lollipops when the fucker throwing them tosses them in the air.
---
i don't know why this is getting so much hate. if they sold beta invites (a limited quantity of course) i think a TON of people would pay for it. i probably would have if the price was right. and for the record, i know beta isn't the same as early access.
---
I just hope I can get the names I had in vanilla.  
---
Anyone know if you can still use 2 letter names?
---
HE SAID hes like 30 not 14 ....
---
Well, that's what it is now. They can spam it thinking it means something else but that doesn't change the fact that it's now a symbol for the alt right.
---
Amen.
---
I wonder if some of these bugs are due to a scaling system in the background. Since they reworked all their data during Legion/BFA? so that things could always scale if they wanted them too, I wonder if they plugged the classic data into that same scaling system and are just trying to modify the scaling aspect to "get it right" instead of using specific values like how it originally was? 
---
I'd like to say they wouldn't but you never know.
---
I can't say for certain (I did) but I know with past products that they send out FnF for I have gotten it without being signed up. That said this isn't a normal beta launch so who knows.
---
&gt;That it's not the bosses that dictate the difficulty of a race, it's the people you're competing against.
---
In the same context that if people didn't exist to actually play the game then there wouldn't be a race sure. What an asinine point.
---
&gt;Because you literally linked the proof yourself, but you've seemed happy enough to dig through my logs to insult me, yet you're incapable of seeing that out of the two tiers I've played till the end since I came back in legion I killed the end boss in one of them.
---
If you're talking about EN then I checked your kill and it was ONE YEAR late on the achievement. So no, that obviously does not count rofl. That's like killing Ragnaros in TBC at BT patch.
---
&gt;it's not no reason, the difference is very important. Do we agree that being able to move while casting provides an advantage over not being able to do so? Even in cases where you're not necessarily forced by the encounter to do so?
---
Are you just going to make more statements that are off topic and not relevant, and completely ignore every actual rebuttal to your similar previous points?
---
This is pointless.
---
Not only is movement during casting still pretty limited for many classes, but you are still ignoring your original premise and talking about random other shit.
---
Oh, and the reason i mention your logs, and inability to play your own class properly, is because we're talking about actual efficiency here.
---
If you can't even play your class properly then yeah, no shit you probably wont notice efficiency losses - especially when you're not doing content where you actually need to play properly.
---
It's incredibly obvious when you look at your mythic kills and see 2% speed 4% execution for guild rank, and everyone green logging and shit that none of you have a clue how to play, and when you're playing at like 20% capacity you're not going to notice something that causes an efficiency loss which would actually matter to someone pushing content when it is relevant.
---
Reminder: your original statement:
---
"literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving."
---
I've provided you multiple examples be it class, raid encounter etc of how this is just obviously false. And you continue to bombard me with random side bullshit like "hurr do we not agree that being able to move is better than not being able to move?!" as if that is actually relevant.
---
Furthermore, it is a well known fact that classic raiding is FAR easier than mythic raiding on live. And only an actual pepega would legitimately believe otherwise.
---
32 years old
---
alright, someone explain wtf is a selfie cam.
---
There‚Äôs a lot that goes into a business. A lot of things that add value without being direct monetary support. So if you think people CAN NOT support something without donating money for not receiving the actual product, then idk what to say to you besides go take a business course. 
---
I‚Äôd hardly call my original post angry, it‚Äôs mostly disappointment and trying to prevent future pay to gain advantage situations. We‚Äôre trying to prevent what happened to retail. No my name is not popular, I just oppose the idea of getting people to pay for a product when they don‚Äôt actually receive the product. 
---
You saying you‚Äôre down for race changes for classic explains it all to me. You‚Äôre not someone who even played this game. But you are someone who has a strong opinion on it. Got way too many of those people in the world. No knowledge, but a loud mouth. Adios.
---
You fundamentally don‚Äôt understand how much this system will be exploited, and ruin the immersion of Classic.
---
Loot sharing was nothing compared to how bad layering will be. 5x devilsaur will totally bonk server economies, and people suddenly disappearing layers is going to completely suck
---
https://gfycat.com/amp/flickeringfaithfulasiandamselfly-bingo-nfl-politics-sandersforpresident-gif?usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D
---
I completely agree. They have repeatedly underestimated the scope (and obviously interest in) the project. That‚Äôs why release was pushed back basically as far as possible.
---
Are you not supposed to use pots anymore in wPvP in retail? Man, I potted like crazy in Vanilla....
---
You know what else gets in the way of player experience? Dead servers. Which if I‚Äôm not mistaken is what layering is meant to prevent/help with. Seems like a necessary evil imo
---
Druids are great at leveling as the have a complete kit of tools to handle almost any situation solo. They dont farm particularly fast though as the lack sustainable AoE damage.
---
because people dont do it to actually test, they just want to play the game and basically be useless testers
---
The blueberry girl from Willy Wonka. That is all.
---
Yeah I always hated that I never had cooking maxed out at first also. I will give that a look for sure ! Thanks
---
Why are you even commenting
---
osrs did nothing at all to rs3, the rs3 and osrs playerbase crossover was SUPER low for a very long time. rs3 killed rs3 by selling out to the chinese shareholders. osrs is the more popular game but i can guarantee you 90%+ of the playerbase never played rs3
---
&gt; But BFA is a dumpster fire
---
And it still tops twitch when new content is released for it. 
---
Obviously WoW classic is popular. But the people acting like it's this whole revival of WoW as a game or whatever just don't understand how big retail WoW still is. And classic is definitely not gonna "kill" retail WoW.
---
Bro are you ok
---
Oh yeah, that‚Äôs a great example to counter layering, you merge with a server that has your ex girlfriend! Lol.
---
Layering is inferior to just having more servers.
---
If Blizz gave a shit about player experience they would‚Äôve *never* proposed a system so exploitable and immersion killing
---
I literally opted in for Warcraft instead of World of Warcraft Classic.
---
I'm not fucking crying you are
---
Harsh. They were probably having fun though idk
---
Any email or just bnet flag?
---
you have to opt into it on your accounts page.
---
Does the one with the black hair look like Mel Gibson?
---
This is very important. Hope it‚Äôs addressed.
---
No email, just on the launcher.
---
The osrs playerbase and rs3 playerbase arent the same people. its not like when osrs was released everyone on rs3 swapped over. hell no. stop pushing this agenda that osrs killed rs3, rs3 died because of terrible development decisions and pandering to chinese stakeholders. I've played osrs since release and i can tell you for a fact that a very large majority of players that play osrs never played rs3.
---
Drain life restores health yes.
---
&gt; Layering is inferior to just having more servers.
---
Congrats, blizz made 3,000 servers to handle the launch population. Your server now has 13 players.
---
That depends on what you farm.  If you can farm non-range stuff, you can bear farm packs pretty good.  Farming something like Furbolg in Felwood isn't going to be nearly as good as using a hunter, but farming something you can LOS or gather as packs works fine as a bear.
---
Pots exist to be used.
---
What does it matter if the stranger is on a different layer or the stranger is on a different server.
---
Fact is, layering is exploitable and kills immersion. Old Blizzard would‚Äôve *never* proposed an idea that ruins immersion and is so exploitable
---
u wot?
---
Thanks. The way the parent comment was worded seemed to imply the opposite.
---
The amount of people seemingly getting in is surprising, hopefully this continues each day
---
I'm totally for updated graphics with the same vanilla mechanics. Even some spell effect updates as long as it keeps the same vibe of vanilla spells
---
No email for me either.
---
I believe someone IS making a guild formed entirely of casual players with families who are there to understand "fuck gotta go" moments
---
Holyfield/Foreman over mayweather anyday for straight dps. If he wanted an evasive tank he woulda said so.
---

---
Good at farming Ore/Herbs due to stealth + humanoid tracking in cat form to avoid PvP.
---
They aren't great at doing AoE farming may beable to setup something with bear form if well geared feral for lasher farming.  never tried it myself tho
---
This is the new "my demon shouldn't disappear when I summon a new one!".
---
To be honest, this was more informative than half the shit that‚Äôs posted in here. The streamer hate here is just strange. I‚Äôm not in beta and I‚Äôm glad to pop in to see Asmon and Esfand play for a few minutes.
---
I've seen a few different druid farms around. I know for sure Feral is able to do DM stealth runs, and also [the lasher farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rttXIFcLv2o&amp;ab_channel=Leemo). I've also seen videos of Boomkins AOE farming high level elementals
---
I'm no expert but it seems like they actually have above average farming ability at least.
---
Wait.... 2 GOLD???
---
Also just got in Been Subscribed Since release with drop offs after Cata
---
People want to live in a communist world.
---
I believe it will be wiped.
---
How YOU doin?
---
I've set mine up now just in case. Hope that wasn't a deciding factor to be honest.
---
No, it'll wipe
---
really?
---
Absolutely. I'd play classic again if it simply used all the latest gfx and art assets, at least as a toggable option.
---
How do they corner it thou? Black lotus respawns you know.
---
They may have more but typically that means the price will go down. If they hold them. Then who cares? More will come be ause they respawn...
---
I dont understand. Am I missing something?
---
They allows wipe after betas. There will be no hold overs.
---
The layering thingy will low the number of servers needed, you can get like 3 to 5 layers in a server, and depending on the player cap it can be a lot more, so, no worries, you can have a streamer in your server but not on the same layer lol at least in the beginning.
---
of course it'll wipe, that'd be massively unfair if some people just had a 3 month headstart
---
Hnnnnggggfffmmm.. Must.. Not be... Tox....
---
Are you fucking retarded?
---
No e-mail, checked the launcher and hot damn!
---
Does Skorch have a stream at all?
---
&gt;But feeling and actually factually being better are two different things.
---
if you have to choose between the two, it's much better for players to be able to feel stronger than to actually be stronger. Perception overrules reality in almost all cases
---
TBF I'm not sure it's helping.
---
It just looks like a slower BFA, with less quests and more grinding.
---
Watching a guy autoattack a mob for 10 seconds isn't appealing :s
---
Well hopefully they have another wave tomorrow ):
---
People that complain about graphics are basement dwellers.
---
Just like her butthole
---
Why don't cut a square of grass out of your lawn? It will probably grow faster.
---
nope theyre going to unlock it to allow you to lvl up to 60 and you will be able to play that character at launch and have a 3 month head start on everyone else
---
None of them where prepared by the sound of it.
---
It's a different dungeon. 
---
Updated with Cata. This is old old school.
---
You can‚Äôt check out that noise :(

Lynch King best king.
---
But didn't he actually report it? If he did, is it really a sarcastic comment?
---
Thank you, Joe Rogan.
---
Yep! I griefed my own faction back in vanilla and I got turned down from a raiding guild due to it.
---
Is the rare mob border an add-on? Or did you earn that in Vanilla somehow ?
---
I want my raids to be fun, efficient, and effective. I want my raiders to experience end game content in a way that means we move move forward efficiently with minimal time wiping so we can get back to our busy lives. I won‚Äôt be insisting on 100% perfect consumable use but will subtly encourage competition on the damage meters (not by posting them or rewarding more gear to better performers but just by personal acknowledgement). I will accept suboptimal specs only to a minor extent. For the reasons above, I want my raiders in PvE spec unless they play a role where a hybrid spec is uniquely viable. I will not be bringing moonkins or ret paladins or ferals who haven‚Äôt farmed crowd pummelers unless we have a spot that would otherwise be empty. But that hopefully will not be necessary as we will roll alternates who will still accumulate loot points for being on standby.

Yea why not? You ever play new games and find them hard or have to learn new things? Its fun for me...so if thats fun for you. Then sure!

Every game is good for new players of you want to play it lmao.

Gear shouldn't break, that means I can't play!
---
1.1.1 : The Daze effect has been reworked to have a smaller chance of occurring against players level one to 29. The chance of a successful Daze effect against players 30 and above remains the same.
---
And most players won‚Äôt have a clue about layering.
---
My group that I talk with (5 of us), I‚Äôm the only one that talks about layering. The rest don‚Äôt care, nor care to comprehend it.
---
We all played on a dead server together, so their view is do anything to where the server isn‚Äôt dead in a few months.
---
Confirmed, watching grass grow is better than BFA.
---
I don't get it. Why watch this guy?
---
My suggestion would be the r/Woweconomy reddit, and their discord.  It‚Äôs how I began for the most part. (I‚Äôm pretty good at learning farms spots myself, but the economics of it, the reddit/people helped boost me up a bit. Now it‚Äôs mostly just self learning)
---
Just be warned, like many community‚Äôs, they have ...issues with those outside of it. (They refer to regular players as ‚Äúmonkeys‚Äù for making mistakes for example). I don‚Äôt agree with their attitudes at times, but I‚Äôd say a majority of the people there are better than that.
---
I also highly recommend TheUnderminejournal website / addon for looking up item history on your realm or globally.  It‚Äôs a good way to learn what sells, how often, how much is in stock on your server... and even better, who‚Äôs listening what (this is to figure out what markets other goblins are controlling. Extremely useful imo)
---
TSM, otherwise known as Tradeskilmasters, is the addon of choice for most goblins using the auctionhouse.  However if you have any experience in auctionator or another such tool, it‚Äôs fine to keep using that (a lot of people don‚Äôt like the new tsm, but it‚Äôs so powerful it‚Äôs hard not to use)
---
And in all honesty most of the time is spent learning how it all works. Once you get a hang on it, it‚Äôs as simple as logging in, taking ten minutes, and your done for the day (unless you have a crap ton of items to scan on the auctionhouse... that‚Äôs slow as hell due to server so can take a while :P) 
---
And my personal opinion if you go for it, don‚Äôt worry what your making vs others in the reddit or wherever. Just worry about trying to improve. Someone will always make more than you. (I know two people who make 100m+ a day easily, and can push way, way more than that when they care to. Just because of the markets they control, how many servers there on, ect. It‚Äôs basically their IRL job because they‚Äôre retired) just don‚Äôt look at people like that and go ‚Äúman I suck at this‚Äù
---
And if you‚Äôve got any questions I‚Äôd love to help where able.  I‚Äôm not the best by far, even though I do make more than most, it‚Äôs mainly due to multiboxing and my main server having no real goblins.  (May take a bit to respawns to any, as I don‚Äôt always check reddit every time I‚Äôm on!)
---
Good luck with whatever you decide to do though, and hope you enjoy classic!
---
It‚Äôs only the smells
---
Big yikes
---
You need active sub to get beta invite
---
It rocks. Much simpler than wrath, less classes And talents to know about, overall better feel
---
Use a questing guide and you‚Äôll never have the issue wondering where to go
---
 **Do you think it is even remotely possible to play this game and find a guild of people that are casual and raid once a weekend?**   
---
Short answer: Yes.  
---
Other answer: People have uncovered a lot of secrets that people were not aware in the launch so you can play, altho it will be a lot harder (impossible in my opinion) to do something like aq40 or naxx (hp and dps checks will not be met if you are a casual that raids like only once a week), but you will be able to clear most of the content so yeah a lot of people will be like that so don't worry about it.
---
Yeah only because I forgot to cancel it when I stopped playing BFA a couple of months ago.
---
I couldn't clip it, but Esfand reported a bug about delayed damage earlier too, more than just them are actually testing.
---
Ingame item that you can use to take a selfie of your character. It's novel and fun.
---
&gt; If you look at this with the understanding that the vast majority of games released don't ever actually hit the front page even on launch
---
Pretty much all WoW content releases does. 
---
&gt;and you have the makings of a longstanding front page presence
---
Yeah, WoW has always had a long standing presence on Twitch, no doubt that will continue as people play classic. 
---
But it is interesting that people like staysafe and esfand still get a big amount of views despite not being retail WoW streamers (at least I don't think they are). Asmond and Soda being at the top is hardly surprising though.
---
Correcting a raid lead? Right to jail.
---
As much as I want to play myself, watching him play was mind numbingly boring üòÑ
---
ouch. Good luck :(
---
Can confirm, more invites went out today.
---
Did you get an email?
---
A diaper cyclone!
---
If they made achievements only you can see as a means of tracking progress and statistics.  If only there was some Addon that could do that. :)
---
&gt;  plenty of kids have always played wow.
---
Goddang, I feel old now
---
Was there a more clear post clarifying this or are you going off of the one from the main post about release dates?
---
I miss the pretty weird twisting that happened when you degaussed. It was neat.
---
Pretty sure Mike Thython would single handedly carry the dps charts with that [Ear Bite] critical hit
---
I remember R1 Redemption people into fires to kill them again.
---
I was there!
---
People have a right to spend their money on whatever they want but man it always strikes me as a little silly to sub to someone who is already rich from subs.  
---
Depending on where you place a sub the difference ranges from a streamer you like getting a nice meal this week, to a streamer you like buying a lambo.
---
Not sure what you mean.
---
You feel old because children have had access to games since 04?
---
Or because people who were &lt;12 years old when wow launched are now in their mid 20s?
---
Don't lose all hope yet, not all my friends with FnF got their invites yet. Right now its about 50/50 (out of a pool of like 15 people w/ FnF).
---
Like, will you be able to transfer your beta character to the live servers? Because if that is actually your question, then absolutely not. That would be ridiculous and you should feel bad for even thinking that would be a possibility.
---
Yesx3
---
Maybe tomorrow, just in time for the weekend!
---
Well it‚Äôs been 13 years...people‚Äôs brains are fuzzy
---
the latter.  I remember dorm mates being so damn excited for the launch of WoW.
---
Dozens!
---
Thanks! That's what I was hoping. I always got to certain points back then where I wasn't even sure where to go/how to get there for quests. I'll be using quest guides for sure this time.
---
In this case, yeah, obviously. Was just talking generally about (Blizzard) betas.
---
it's a hypothetical.
---
A player can have a legitimate reason to NOT roll on server A, and instead, roll on server B.
---
If blizz merges A and B, fuck this player, I guess?
---
Just a heads up, I just walked into my local GameStop and was able to pre order once for my friend and I.
---
I got in. Only resubbed when the beta was announced on Tuesday.
---
There will be a lot more than a few people at 60 in the first week, let alone first phase. And it's those people who will look to take advantage of it. Throwing an invite doesn't sound "incredibly hard" to me. I really think you're underestimating it. Who knows how many layers a server will have, the potential for abuse is there regardless. 
---
Even though it's going away in phase 2 the gold will still last.
---
I suspect if you have everyone chug nature protection pots it's much easier.  I don't know if it's 5 mannable even then, but I don't think you need 40
---
Except PotG is Play of the Game, not PoG. Pogchamp is just the the name that that emote got because of a video about pogs, and the pog emote is just the mouth part of pogchamp.
---
Neither of us got an email, access showed up on our launchers.
---
After watching his video earlier today, this guy is someone who doesn‚Äôt deserve this type of attention. Complete douche imo
---
I want to practice my routes on pservers, but knowing that regen rates/ armor values are all different severely changes clear times. Just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.
---
The difference could also be accounted by the fact that he is leveling without add ons. Ever for the good players Quest Helper/LazyPig/Cartographer can really help a lot.
---
Home life must be pretty bad huh?
---
Is it showing up under your game accounts in bnet as well? Curious because I‚Äôm out of town for the night and I keep checking mine.
---
You just go with the flow man. I didnt understand it either for a very lobg time. Its just memes tbh and chat can be pretty funny at times
---
Ah, yeah.
---
The passage of time is scary. I was prepubescent when WoW launched and now I'm a real adult worrying about mortgages, taxes and deadlines.
---
It's been a while!
---
Show me where the said it. And if the sentence starts with participants that is in no way a clear statement
---
My vote goes to shaman or Druid.
---
There is something about there being a top tier almost unattainable raid though. It gives people something to thrive for. Selling the dream of "One day I can make it there". It keeps servers alive longer makes the world feel that much bigger when there always something to aim for.
---
Anything goes in wPvP streamer is just salty as I would assume anyone would be after being at 30% HP while killing a mob and having someone ambush you. Cherry ontop is the potion. Nothing wrong with it lol but most people would probably me mad.
---
This is a little (very) misleading. 
---
The 100k views was concurrent between all 5 party members. Asmongolds viewership was around 50k. The other 50k was split between the other 4 members.
---
It also helped that it happened literally right after sodapoppin went offline.
---
I'm curious. For those who got the invite, does it show up as a separate game on your Battle.net account website under Games &amp; Subscriptions?
---
Content creators don‚Äôt require being subbed to retail to get into the beta.  The guy who made or runs barrens.chat or whatever it is got an invite to the beta and he isn‚Äôt subbed to retail.
---
Actually quite swell. I'm just an asshole :)
---
if you do a mage/priest combo...one of you tailor and one do alchemy... gear and pots for both
---
It's official blizzard info when you sign into beta on battle net website.
---
Everything needs exposure lol.
---
Otherwise Coca-Cola wouldn't bother with advertising.
---
This sub also hates everything about classic haha
---
Was your account created in 2004?
---
Yeah realm merges are stupid. I'd rather try layering and give ppl free realm change
---
I say we get the official "wow" subreddit, and their game which is technically the original old one get this subreddit
---
Just received an invite. 
---
* I opted in the first day you could I think a few hours after it was an option.
---
* I'm not a content creator.
---
* I activated my sub when I opted in.
---
* I was subbed the first month of BFA, and the first month of other expansions prior. I played a lot more in Wrath and TBC than other expansions. 
---
* US
---
* November 24, 2004. Also played the open beta but don't believe you needed an account for that.
---
* I no-lifed vanilla to an unhealthy degree. I got Rank 13 and have that feat of strength. Not sure if that factors into their decisions or not.
---
why does anyone want to relive classic again? ugh. horrible days.
---
now a BC reboot, on the other hand...
---
https://m.imgur.com/KDO5CBM
---
That is from project ascension, that was from a friends screenshot.  
---
I am sure there are addons for rare/elites frames though
---
Nah fuck that. We dont need a slippery slope. Weve seen where that goes.
---
We need new custom content for Classic. Nothing more nothing less.
---
Neither was tips LULW
---
Twitch
---
Horde could do it, but its a loooooong walk for them to get there
---
Opposed to having 3k+ people in a starter zone?
---
A porcelain god drought (bc poopsocks and piss jugs)
---
Lmao that definitely wasn‚Äôt the response I was expecting - well played. I hope I don‚Äôt see you around in classic :P
---
The world is much smaller, there less places to get lost, although the 1-60 is basically the same as when you played in wotlk. It‚Äôs a amazing game that has been played and lived by millions. Not every game is for every one but if you give it a chance I bet you will love it.
---
Yes it was.
---
As for chatting actual sentences it's definitely hit or miss depending on how fast chat is moving, but for emotes or easy to recognize spam, it's essentially the internet equivalent of cheering at a sporting event. If you see something cool you can throw out an emote and it's easy to feel the reaction of the crowd based on the wall of emotes flying past. Were as someone who makes a joke might hear a crowd of people laughing, a streamer who makes a joke can see a bunch of LULs fly up and gives them the same feedback without having to stop and read comments.
---
No.  Those things do give advantages that change some aspects of the game, but it's very minor compared to the entire look of your character changing depending on a client setting.
---
Why watch tv channels about couples that constantly cheat on each other?
---
Depends on the streamer. Some streamers get more than others. Considering Asmon consistently gets 25k+, he probably gets a decent better chunk.
---
This guy absolutely nailed the Female NE hunter stereotype to a fucking T
---
Are you guys really that naive? Dude clearly wasn't healing and just standing there, looks like he purposely wanted a wipe for people like yalls mind to be entertained. Obv this will happen in real classic but that was obv planned.
---
Do you have a active sub?
---
Except streaming is almost comically less difficult and in many cases (see asmongold) requires significantly less skill.
---
on the bright side starting areas won't be as congested!   
---
don't worry about it too much, the no lifes will always have an edge over you, but the reality is, most everyone who wants to play will be limited to some extent.
---
If you listen closely you can hear the quiet
---
*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE* 
---
of noobs who died here almost 15 years ago
---
Bruh. It‚Äôs literally about getting the game.
---
That would kill the game. WoW having 3+ versions would be absolutely unnecessary and would bring a slow death.
---
Classic needs new custom content. Forget everything we already experienced. TBC is dead. We need to do what OSRS did and create an alternative timeline, where blizzard keeps the Vanilla spirit. 
---
We begged for this because we love Vanilla. If we progress to WoTLK we ruin everything we begges for.
---
Man that posts responses feel so hostile.
---
not fucked at all, the pace of vanilla is very slow. theres no need to be in any rush
---
Proper sad I'm missing out on all that initial madness / hype. üò≠
---
You'll be fine, the guilds that will outpace you while you're on vacation already have their rosters set or are pretty close to doing so. 
---
The rest will always be looking to fill certain slots throughout the first phase at least if not longer. 
---
You'll have plenty of time to "catch up" and find a guild. 
---
We used to have difficulty finding 40 people for raids, so we'd do this with warlocks. Dot, dot, dot, tab. Dot, dot, dot, tab.
---
Or we'd have one person playing two priests and basically have a healing rotation. One heals while the other regens, then tab and trade roles.
---
Only works for the tank-and-spank fights, though.
---
He says thing like "I 100% remember that from vanilla, 100% I true I know this"
---
Why do ppl say he didnt play vanilla?
---
Thx Ill have to check my launcher when I get home from work :)
---
^ this is my future wife.
---
Some guys will get some stuff in a computer game, oh no the sky is falling.
---
I‚Äôll be making one if I get in for rogue. Otherwise I‚Äôm too salty to put the time in.
---
You need active sub to get invite. Are you sure people who played game only 15 years ago have active sub?
---
&gt; Give it a few months, all the naysayers will shut up and it'll be great going back and reading their comments after they've been proven wrong.
---
Will also be interesting to read all the comments on places like this when people realise most of their guild members on classic stop playing because something new released for retail WoW. Then they will come back when a new classic phase is out or whatever.
---
Okay that is kind of amazing.
---
I was responding to another users comment.
---
Regarding communication, that's entirely possible. I can see some guilds wanting to recruit across all layers but I guess they could do it on discord/realm forums. It would break immersion more though since you wouldn't see familiar people chatting if you started questing with a friend or if you joined a guild on a different layer and all the people you leveled a long would not only disappear from ingame but the chat as well. If they allowed communication however the chat would be unreadable during the first few days I would imagine.
---
I'm just used to the break neck pace of progression when raiding in high end guilds in retail.
---
The problem is is that classic may be classic but a lot of the top guilds are still going to approach it with a modern retail mentality. I do think it's gonna impact me in terms of raiding at that level.
---
Oh well!
---
I think this time it's going to catch me and I cant wait! I used to watch that south park episode where they play wow all the time and everytime I saw it I'm like, "man that game looks fun." I know that the things in that episode cant really happen in the game, but I just really liked the artwork and look of the game in general.
---
&gt;if the druid just spammed mf/wrath woulda been a kill. evasion tank worked well and bought enough time.
---
Imagine being this retarded
---
My experience on a p-server has been that traps in Vanilla aren't very reliable anyway.
---
He was a good druid when the expansion favoured them, he's trash here, I was howling at the clip.
---
I'm not saying it's sharding. That's completely different. This just allows many people to be in the same zone without there actually being TOO many people in said zone. Every layer is it's own, they each have their own separate nodes, boars, and cactus apples. It's the opposite of sharding, instead of using it to fill zones, it's used to depopulate it. Sure 500 people in valley of trials or coldridge valley is still a fuck ton, but I'd take 500 people over 3k people any day of the week. This just allows me to level up in a manner that's just a little bit more efficient, a little bit more streamlined. By the time its removed you'll long be 60 and in MC and you'll forget all about it and probably won't give two shits about how the zones and server was when you started out, because the initial population spike is done, and it's stable.
---
not at all dude. servers will be there for a long time. guilds will be doing progression long after naxx is cleared. you will miss out on being able to do server firsts and shit but honestly, it wont have a major effect. i started wow in 1.10 and was able to do all teh content my pc could handle.
---
Paid for a sub last night then updated my settings again to include beta for all the games listed
---
You wont stop until 60? Thats like a week of not doing anything else lol
---
Ppl do it a lot. What do you think the V is for in STV
---
&gt; if everyone involved is fine with it?
---
[Yeah there was definitely nobody fed up with Tipsout's shit](https://clips.twitch.tv/CourteousCulturedWaffleYouWHY)
---
Didn‚Äôt get an email but saw it in the drop down menu! Excited to be back home!
---
I also want to watch this expert mage beating all the streamers racing to 30. Please tell me he has a twitch or youtube somewhere D:
---
Rs3 killed itself way before osrs was even considered
---
Who is Skorch?
---
You spelt troll wrong :)
---
I hold very little weight for private servers, tell me what the values as compared to vanilla not pservers lol
---
Even though people may disagree with you, I‚Äôd love to see the number of subs that spiked this week for people resubbing just for the CHANCE to get into beta.
---
wow I was out of the loop on this one as well thats fantastic news! omg im so excited now
---
Hmm, never thought about it that way.  You're right though.
---
you can enter brd as a 40 man raid.
---
tell me what part of the comment was disrespectful
---
That's a pretty odd arguement. Are 3k people not enough for you to make friends/enemies with within the first month? Do you need to have several layers for a pool of 12k players total to befriend? Seriously.
---
The reason is probably more technical, as well as to make it appear more seemless, but you just can't allow people to hop in and out whenever they please. Like the other guy said, it's exploitable. Not just by tryhards either, everyone will be likely to search for a new layer once they find out their quest mob is dead and they don't feel like waiting for a respawn.
---
As someone who browses retail sub every 2-3 days and this one maybe once/twice every 2 weeks, I got a far better impression of this sub that retail. It seems like every time I browse /r/wow there is a pretentious "unpopular opinion: classic will suck" post there
---
Method had multiple 10k plus viewerships going during both prog races ... Lol still same shit here in this sub
---
I've seen it before, just rare enough that I wasn't sure if it's an add-on or not
---
yup, my quest helper was alt+tab thottbot lol
---
God damn Clippy. And don't even get me fucking started on cleaning those god damned little rolling pins. Especially if a long hair got wrapped around it. Fucking hell.
---
Nope, I just saw in my sub history that I have used 60 day gamecards in 2005.
---
In my defense, when I‚Äôm waiting on the group to fill or people to show up at the entrance, I‚Äôm continuously running/jumping/using non targeted abilities simply to pass the time. In general I will stick it out until the group disassembles due to someone else if the group is horrible, and I try to explain what people are messing up if it‚Äôs obvious. You‚Äôre saying I should be kicked for pressing the space bar?
---
It‚Äôs what plants crave
---
Initial launch will be awful. Blessing in disguise.
---
I can't believe these are the retards that Blizzard let into the Beta.
---
I'm sure you would.  But look at all the hate blizz got for including the classic demo in the blizzcon package.
---
i know man :/ try to not overthink it.   
---
1) holiday is for enjoying yourself 
---
2) we are 3 months away before this even happens
---
you got this
---
Classic WILL get boring after 2 years. People can only do the same content so many times.
---
What comes after that is 2 options. 
---
1. TBC, then Wrath etc.
---
2. Alternate timeline
---
I would be in favor of an alternate timeline that will never get expansions. No new features either. Just new raids for after Naxx that drops gear that can't be used in pvp (or new pvp gear added too but that might be asking current Blizzard too much)
---
but that's obviously not going to happen when they can just release TBC with minimal effort.
---
Some of this community is definitely toxic af... The vitriol you can see here sometimes is palpable. I still stay subbed knowing people have the best intentions but I'm not entirely convinced it's not just a very loud group of people in an echo chamber. We'll see with the longevity if it can sustain.
---
logged in just to say. what the actual fuck
---
Tipsout is entertaining at times, but... is it just me or.. he is not really a good player is he? I mean, I often see him playing in situation where I think I could do that 10 times better.... But I never mained a Warrior so, maybe I'm just biased against streamers in general.
---
This is revolutionary. Maybe I don't need my poop sock anymore
---
If the tank is a diva but gives correct information, that is fine. The issue is when the tank thinks they are God‚Äôs gift to the dungeon and refuse to take constructive criticism.
---
Same. I love the rage-inducing unfairness
---
It's a meme report, it adds to the comedic effect and baits people who don't understand sarcasm. There's three kinds of people, first group understands this and likes it, second group understands it but it isn't their kind of humor which I can respect. Then there's the 3rd group of dense people who didn't catch it. Practically everyone in this sub. 
---
/r/AteTheOnion/
---
RS3 is not retail WoW. Retail is still a huge game. People won't just stop playing that because they can play classic too.
---
Nah, I need those plebs to grind HKs to feed my ego.
---
Maybe some more tomorrow for you guys. I hope so.
---
I think beggars are choosy :)
---
If servers had the correct population cap from the get go it‚Äôd be the exact same effect without the exploitation and layer collapse issues we are facing
---
I had one of those Amtecs. Fucking things quit working all the time. Got an HP Lambast 101g  with the "new and improved quiet tubes" only had to sacrifice the two little horizontal lines in the screen.
---
&gt; if you have to choose between the two, it's much better for players to be able to feel stronger than to actually be stronger.
---
It's more complicated than that. 
---
Not every player feels that way, surely. Their opinion matters too when designing a game. You'll have players look at the system and say, "I have no choice. This is boring." For them they see past that illusion. 
---
For the players that do enjoy that system, they are enjoying it because they either don't know there's an illusion, or they don't care. Which raises questions on its own. Do you keep something in place when it could potentially be better? Is it better to have players ***feel*** rather than ***actually be*** empowered by their choices? 
---
Right? Take a look at the first 10 points (level 20) you put into the old talent system. Let's say I go Druid and Feral. The first two tiers are largely uninteresting. I'll get Ferocity to reduce the cost of my abilities, and then I'll pick up Feral Instincts. For my level 20 point I'll pick up Feral Charge. 
---
I've gone until level 20 to get an ability through talents. None of my choices so far have been meaningful and most of them are not a real choice. Most of the time there's a clear winner. 
---
For the new talent system you get to chose an ability at level 15 for Feral Druids, and the choice actually has weight. 
---
&gt; Predator - Predator causes the cooldown of Tiger's Fury Icon Tiger's Fury to be reset when a target with one of your Bleed effects applied dies, and lasts an additional 5 seconds.
---
&gt; Sabertooth - Sabertooth increases the damage of Ferocious Bite Icon Ferocious Bite by 20%, and refreshes the duration of your Rip Icon Rip effect on the target by 4 seconds per Combo Point spent.
---
&gt; Lunar Inspiration - Lunar Inspiration allows the use of Moonfire Icon Moonfire in Cat Form Icon Cat Form, causing it to grant 1 Combo Point, deal damage based on Attack Power, and cost 30 Energy.
---
Predator is useful if you expect your enemies to die frequently. That's a dps increase on fights that have adds or lots of AoE situations. 
---
Sabertooth is better in situations where there's a single target to worry about and no adds. 
---
Lunar inspiration just isn't good in general. 
---
Here you have choice depending on context and the ability to jump between them as you see fit. 
---
Finally, you have it from the designer's point of view. Let's go back to my Shadow Ward example. What is the point of them taking an ability that is rarely used or even on your bar, and making sure it is balanced in terms of numbers and usage as you level past 60 (potentially). 
---
Assuming they do everything they can to make it competitive and useful, not everything is going to be good. That Shadow Ward ability will probably sit on your bar unused for 99% of the time you play. You'll likely not find yourself in a position to press it (it only absorbs shadow) and pressing it may not even be the right button compared to other spells you could cast (like more damage).

---
perp and the guys are absolutely more important, no doubt
---
I'm just saying that a good beta test also wants players to play normally with but I agree with you on the comparative importance
---
I've learned through this sub that 'Classic Summer' meant to a lot of people that they'd be playing vanilla WoW throughout the summer, which is something they apparently did before.
---
I do feel bad for them.  I'm also kind of jealous because I never got that experience, but at the same time, I had other experiences.
---
I always took it to mean that Classic WoW would release sometime during the summer this year, so I'm happy to have the release date now.
---
The worst were the "high performance" ones with 4 little rolling pins in them. Fuck me those were so bad
---
I too gained access to beta in this wave.  Account created in 2004 and played all expansions except MoP
---
That‚Äôs cool but obviously classic will still fail because people are just nostalgic, they‚Äôll go back to bfa 
---
kappa
---
Do you realise that the old graphics are available? There is an option to select between the two.
---
Just got home, I‚Äôm in!!! For those wondering, I didn‚Äôt get an email. It was just there in the launcher today! Soooooo stoked.
---
Yeah but it's the closed beta. They are doing multiple stress tests from now until launch. Most people will still get the chance to play I would assume.
---
Imagine saying you'll pay for a Classic beta invite and asking someone else "do you guys even think before you post"
---
but if we progress to TBC we'll be in the golden age. Can't it go from there?
---
He's a [human meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzy1uUgeRPI)
---
:)
---
What do you mean?
---
Isn't frostbolt what mages are supposed to spam?
---
ffxi, everquest, etc. are all still going strong and have REALLY unengaging gameplay in terms of action or apm. and osrs was largely spending 30 hours right clicking trees or other things for marginal upgrades, lol.
---
your horror is our true love.
---
If vanilla is a success, BC will come. They said as much in the last dev video.
---
An order of magnitude would be going from 9 to 90 hours
---
seems like a stretch.
---
There is much, much less convenience from wrath. You will die a lot. There's a large grind. These traits were kind of the standard for games during those times, though.
---
Depending what addons they allow, a lot of convenience will be fixed.  
---
\-But things like having to travel and obtain FP's  
---
\-FP's taking a long time   
---
\-You're mounted and see someone and wanna stealth asap? Gotta get off the mount first then hit stealth  
---
\-No quest guide. You'll have a tracker, but it won't tell you conveniently where to go on the map.  
---
\-You will have to run to each dungeon. Unless there's a warlock. Summoning stones, and LFG/LFR isn't apart of classic.  
---
There's more, this is just off the top of my head.
---
You will die a lot no matter what class you play. More if you play warrior, more if you're on a pvp server. Don't be surprised if you're spawn camped for 10-30mins at times.
---
The grind is massive. It's a lot of grinding. 40 man raids take all day, and hopefully your one item drops and you win the roll.
---
The pvp/honor grind is really massive as it's relative to other players grinding. If other players are going absolutely ham (they will, people account sharing and such), it'll become more grind for you in the pvp realm. But this is only really a problem at the later ranks. Typically this is regulated by the top pvp clan to control the bad effects this can have.
---
However, if you enjoy it without trying to rush everything, and with friends, it's a lot of fun. You'll spend a lot of time with the people you play with due to how the game works, so make sure you have a good connection with em.
---
Cant stop wont stop! :)
---
Updated! Now people can put in their own values if they copy the sheet.
---
So is the okay sign, clown symbolism, and the rainbow flag. See the problem?
---
Garrot - my loyal Imp.. hard to go without him.
---
If you watch a more normal sized streams, especially with a sluggish game like classic, the one playing usually reads what people are writing, answering questions or just chatting or whatever.
---
&gt;I dont understand the point of pretending to be knowledgeable about the game.
---
Because it's profitable.
---
I don't think there will be any "collapse issues" as time goes on I'm sure there will just be a little less layers over a time period until the server is stabilized. I'm at least a little bit sure blizzard knows what they're doing when running a game
---
Depends entirely on how much money you have saved up and what you are doing during unemployment. Got enough saved to live off of for several years and Classic WoW coming out? Sounds like the best of times to me, I'll be doing it for a while as I likely have enough money to keep going until I get bored of it several times over, if not I'll be looking for work to keep gaming closer to 2030.
---
Every time I see these posts I read ‚Äúhey, don‚Äôt level faster than me! I‚Äôm insecure! Wait for me before you get epics and clear content!‚Äù
---
Just checked because Of this comment and I‚Äôm in too!
---
Where can you check when your account was created?
---
thats azzy sarcasm mate
---
Because I can.
---
Yup, all about personality. A buddy of mine rakes 25k a month from subs. Literally built a super van and just travels around gaming in a bad ass van set up all over the country. 
---
It's one of those Dodge Sprinter vans. Huge back bit with a bed, stove and computer set up he records in. Shit is fucking sweet. I wish I had the time to dedicate to try to get to that point, I've been told by friends I'm fun to watch and listen to. I just don't have the time or funds to try and start doing that.
---
I got my invite as well. 
---
For reference: Account created December 2004, been *mostly* subbed since then (long breaks during Cata, WoD, BFA.)
---
Autistic screeching caverns
---
You can play on the PTR for BFA without a sub. So why not the beta?
---
Same, only been on twitch last few days for them and stormx.
---
Ah yes tell us more how you leveled to level 6 and consider yourself a classic player lmao
---
Id pay $100 right now
---
Lots.
---
A lot of the streamers I watch do this kind of humor including Tipsout, really common from him. This is not the first sarcastic comment that got parroted here like this. I see the same thing every couple days and people fall for it every time because of the almost universal hate for him in this sub which is ridiculous.

People believe what they want to believe.

You forgot the 4th type that just enjoys baiting nerds into paragraphs of shite that nobody except the author reads.
---
That's the backpedal animation, moonwalking is the forward animation while going backwards.
---
yeah
---
Everyone restarting their client is like a mini DDOS attack.
---
A DDOS of love.
---
The entire dungeon plus quests ?
---
There will be plenty. You gotta remember who this game is pulling. All of us are too old to play religiously now. The game will have a very large casual playerbase
---
Maybe they became teachers? ;)
---
Same man, that was awesome. WoW's back baby :)
---
I nearly died laughing when the ONLY non founding member of MAGA was Esfand!
---
Impressive, and makes me REALLY want to make sure I'm not on the same server as him.
---
I hate people like this. I don't mind rich people, if you provide something that people want and pay for it, awesome. But don't sit there and fucking lie about it so you can try to pity party people into donating more or what not. He says that shit so much too "it's not like I make a lot of money from this you know" like every damn stream.
---
Yup, I really enjoyed that.
---
When you die in WOW Classic you dont lose anything though right? Just takes time to revive right? Also PVP is only in those PVP worlds right? I'm not much for that type of gameplay, usually get my ass kicked. But if your on PVE you cant get spawn camed right?
---
What type of character would you suggest I learn the game with?
---
The #NoChanges movement has nothing to do with stupid bs like this. Please do not misrepresent us.
---
Sounds like about $7500 from the new subs alone.
---
I had to draw one during an exam in a Comp Sci unit, can't recall which.
---
What I meant to convey was that someone doing all of those things is trouble, not necessarily someone doing only one of those things.
---
But it is definitely a big red flag to me. Vanilla WoW needs patience. If you are so hopped up that you literally can't cope with waiting for a couple of minutes without zooming around in circles or mashing your keyboard then I immediately suspect you won't wait for the tank to mark targets or build threat, and that you won't think about whether items are really upgrades for you before you mash Need.
---
This may (or may not) be the best place to ask this, due to the popularity of the post.
---
Who is Asmongold?  Or more appropriately, why do they matter so much to this sub?
---
I've seen the name pop up a lot on this sub.  I've also done a cursory search online, and they seem like a currently popular streamer.  Is there more to it than that?
---
cringe
---
Got in tonight as well.
---
Account created 11-23-04
---
I get the ‚Äúlayering part‚Äù it‚Äôs the best possible solution with the least downsides.
---
It‚Äôs the hope that kills us
---
Did you see asmond and esfand stop at the dam and enjoy the view? They even jumped off it and swam to the wetlands:
---
&gt; Although I do think that after release when things like MC start getting streamed that'll also get absolutely insane numbers.
---
If the big streamers level quickly it should be pretty damn big yeah. But if they take 1+ month to get to 60 I'm not sure the game will still keep the attention of that many people. 
---
Following someones journey to lvl 20 and finishing DM is pretty reasonable. But following someone all the way to 60 and into raiding requires quite a lot of dedication, don't think too many more than the streamers normal audience will care much about that.
---
1% crit per 20 agi, it's a crit build until 100% flurry uptime, so..
---
people somehow still not understanding how layerings will work, cringy.

Thrall did not lead the New Horde out of the grasp of demon influence and to the lands of Kalimdor (thx Medivh) and serve as Warchief throughout WCIII, Vanilla WoW, TBC, and WotLK to be known as "the one with the black hair".
---
Look up the youtubers nobbel 87 he has a bunch of  Warcraft Lore  videos to give you a good feeling about the story of the game 
---
Here‚Äôs a summarized video. I believe it also goes into the expansions. If you hear the word burning crusade or legion you can stop watching. 
---
https://youtu.be/bQ__nRnO2mE
---
Yeah, I remember a TIL or something a while ago that Pizza Hut has been doing online ordering since the late 90's.
---
h...how does he do 200 dmg???
---
No problem!
---
I'm convinced half these #NoChanges people are trolls or played on private servers and think that's real Vanilla. It's fun watching them.say things aren't vanilla and it turns out they are basing it on what they did on private servers.
---
Lol if they continue it will be tbc not new content. People fucking love tbc. Ez win for Blizz
---
He's so good at what he does and is an absolute blast to watch. He grew up embracing the typical cave dweller lifestyle and loves it. He has hundreds of stories he shares about how he grew up and the hardships he endured. The way he knows this game is amazing. The amount of knowledge and strategy this guy has for one game is insane. And he's overall just a down to earth dude who is extremely humble.

Asmongold to WoW is what Jesus is to Christianity.

I don‚Äôt understand the retailers skepticism. It seems one sided
---
Because herp derp nOcHaNgEs
---
I'm sure Blizzard appreciates the meme reports.
---
Nah everyone called it VC in vanilla. I distinctly remember that.
---
&gt; but it's very minor compared to the entire look of your character changing  
---
I highly disagree with that statement.  
---
I cannot see how having more polygon of an existing object is going to make a difference.  
---
I can understand that some people think their uglier, but not affect gameplay.  
---
The only graphical setting that can remotely affect gameplay (and only PvP) I can think off top of my head is rendering distance, water texture (vanilla texture is horrible), and whether characters have name tags (though it's already in vanilla).
---
So you build Agility still instead of Str?... Thats not what a lot of other people say
---
Pepega MOONWALKING Pepega
---
Shoes
---
Yeah, lets precast druid heals and take aggro. Have you played classic?
---
That's what these idiots want it seems
---
Definately some of the best video game movies out there.
---
God i want to play so fucking baddly
---
This is why I have a crew I'll be playing with. I'll be tanking, and we have a shaman for heals, hunter for ranged dps, and rogue (probably) for melee.
---
You can‚Äôt get miss under 1% if I remember. 
---
So it would make 3 levels hit like 12% if I remember. And it goes up fast. 
---
At +5 levels it is basically impossible to kill anything.
---
No way people are averaging 6 days /played. 6 days played is close to first on server for most vanilla server launches.
---
yeah the same ones that chose to announce diablo mobile at blizzcon.
---
That's one hell of a strawman
---
The guy that wiped groups, stifled progression, and NEVER. FUCKING. DROPPED. THAT. DAMN. BUCKLER!
---
I really hope not, there's no reason both games can't thrive at the same time. I have no desire to play Classic, but I am nonetheless happy that you guys have your version of the game to play.
---
Hes a alliance mage. Not a streamer as far as im aware of. and level 29 as now
---
Divas, but with purpose.
---
oh man i love hanging with friends and one of us is playing and the other watching. but watching a stream of a very slow paced game is not for me i guess :-)
---
oh no fucking way bro? Are you serious? Ahh man, im glad you were able to do this for us =)
---
It was one of the perks of signing up for the Annual Pass. You got guaranteed access to the MoP beta. This led to four major issues that I can think of:
---
1)  A lot of people made the assumption that "Guaranteed Beta Access" really meant "Guaranteed invite to Beta in the first wave of invites" and the longer they went without an invite to Beta, the more angrier they became, and the more vocal they became about how they were supposedly lied to and that those who said they would still get their promised Beta Access, but that they were never promised WHEN they would get their invites, were basically bootlickers parroting the Blizzard Bait-and-Switch party line.
---
2)  Beta was swarmed with sight seers who had no intention of actually testing and/or breaking the game. This led to a ton of "OMG THIS GAME SUX" posts from people who chose to ignore that the game wasn't in a finished/polished state, and only intended to use the Beta as an early access platform.
---
3)  With so many people using their guaranteed Beta access as early access to the gave, rather than fur what Beta is intended for, burnout for the expansion set in considerably faster than would happen over the normal lifespan of an expansion, causing a push for faster content release and also a considerable drop in subscriber numbers and satisfaction.
---
4)  The increase in complaints from sightseers caused a lot of legitimate bugs reported during beta to be drowned out or missed/overlooked.
---
So, yeah, as much as I wouldn't mind having beta access to test things and try to break the game or find any problems that shouldn't exist, I'll be happy to never see a way to purchase or guarantee beta access.
---
I wouldn't be trying to kick people who are receptive to learning in the first place. It's when they AREN'T receptive that they get kicked.
---
&gt;I've seen the name pop up a lot on this sub.  I've also done a cursory search online, and they seem like a currently popular streamer.  Is there more to it than that?
---
He's one of the top WoW streamers on Twitch.
---
It's not about time, plenty of 0-5 viewer streamers stream daily on a good schedule, but it's irrelevant. You have to actually have a base to bring to twitch before you actually stream on twitch, otherwise how on earth do you gain viewers? You've just got to do something niche on youtube, advertise it on small subreddits and hopefully bring a small base with you.
---
Was there some argument about why Blizzard gives beta invites to content creators? I can't imagine anyone taking issue with that.
---
They already said they're considering adding new content to Classic.
---
Also, if they add TBC, they will SPLIT the community in half, which will kill the movement. The only way to go from TBC is Wrath. And the only way to go from Wrath is Cata.
---
Why the fuck would we want that?
---
You‚Äôre 100% right
---
Lol shit made me laugh when I read the "years of previous game time" response. I bet that guy was sitting in his chair like "fuck that's a good point."
---
No you're right.  He pretty objectively plays poorly in most of his videos I've watched too.
---
&gt; Arugal is tough as hell.
---
Hell, even in TBC Arugal was a tough cookie. Taught us how to release our rage though.
---
Lamissa is back?
---
It's monthly if they keep the sub going.
---
Yeah it really helps clear things up. I was all confused after they clearly spelled out the requirement in the announcement post over 24 hours ago.
---
Ah, okay. Earlier than I thought, but there it is. Thanks!
---
Let's put aside the starting zones, layering won't affect that experience - it will still be 3k or so players spread throughout the starting zones. It's the potential for exploiting that system that bothers me. See, people will be 60 and farming several instances of the same zone's worth of resources at once. They will be doing that for weeks. It changes the game, you teleport to another Azeroth when you don't want to wait for a respawn of something. It's stupid and it will become the norm for questing and leveling and everything.
---
Drink bleach
---
lol tipsout
---
Yeah, all of which take a lot of time to amass lol if I can't get it done and going in a week I can't afford it, period. Unfortunately America hates it's working class and chooses to enslave us with horrendous wages and absurd hours. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thrall is back here with us in Classic. He abandoned BfA just like everyone else will come release.
---
Obviously any sane #NoChanger doesn't care about shit like this. A lot of you in this thread are misrepresenting what #NoChanges is about and I'm sick of it. We don't want to LARP like it's 2004 again and talk about George Bush and 50 Cent in the trade chat, or have stupid bugs just to pretend like we're reliving our vanilla experience.
---
I get the feeling that there is something insidious going on in this sub right now and that is to frame #NoChanges people as losers who want to literally go back to 2004 and want to play the game on dial up while our mom cooks us chicken nuggets. This is obviously intended to make our side look stupid and thus make it easier for Blizzard to start implementing Retail garbage into Classic.
---
\#NoChanges simply means no gameplay or content changes that deviate from the 1.12 patch of Vanilla WoW. That is all.
---
We know you have to opt in
---
I thought vanilla private servers seemed a bit... easy to hit 60
---
Ive Already loaded up to the max tokens you can have on an account in prep for classic haha
---
I just subscribed for the same reason, since I will anyways in 3 months, so whatever. Best of luck everyone!
---
Damn I bet your soooooooo good dude.
---
TBC was the start of the downfall of WoW.
---
To you, maybe. This movement was based on Vanilla WoW, not TBC.
---
If we progress to TBC, we WILL progress further, which completely ruins the idea of a "Classic WoW".
---
Fair enough, I'll delete it since everyone knows apparently. Obviously "Warcraft" isn't all encompassing.
---
This fucker is nothing compared to the murloc event imo...
---
To be fair he's being pedantic about the usage of "pedantic." So he might not know what it is but he's running right into it.
---
What do you mean by sign into beta? I'm either too dumb or just don't know what exactly you're referring to
---
:o
---
I got into the beta by invite and it was the worst one I have been in.
---
Yah
---
Can just have more servers and merge them the regular way
---
its rogue or warrior. those are the only other classes
---
I was there
---
Do you get it via email?
---
Thanks buddy I will, heres to /u/classicwowcomin
---
I‚Äôm so disconnected from streaming culture. I just can‚Äôt comprehend how so many people throw money at guys sitting in front of their PC playing games. Like one of these guys got a $50 tip while I was watching. Like, I‚Äôm not poor by any means, but $50? Then they‚Äôre just like ‚Äúyooo thanks so much random dude. That means so much to me dude thank you‚Äù then they move on.
---
I just don‚Äôt get it.
---
I don't and don't understand people that do.
---
You're right, I didn't get invited. Pepehands
---
I've seen people posting how they got invites to the beta without active subscription. And still see confusion on reddit (me included) so I asked an admin to see what they said. Guess the people who claimed they got invites without subs were lying. The official blizzard post says "Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account" That could be interpreted as: A) you need to be subbed to participate in the beta if you got an invite, or B) you need to be subbed to participate for a chance to get invite.
---
Same exact situation. 2004, played every expansion, re subbed on announcement
---
Yeah but new expansions retain us for 2 months whereas Classic will be 2 months to 60, then months of T1 T2 and T3 with plenty to do in-between.
---
I can confirm that I will spend more time leveling then I have playing BFA total.
---
They‚Äôll regret layering once it‚Äôs implemented, all the whiners here will.
---
My mind is boggled how Blizzard could propose an idea that ruins immersion that much and is so exploitable. Old Blizzard put player experience as #1 and would‚Äôve never sacrificed it for anything
---
That hurt so bad. Everyone just rushing in like a reckless moron.
---
This is why I loved Classic. Builds had their purposes. Tanks were tanks. Not everyone could tank if they had to, and hunter pets couldn't just magically not die for hours on end. You had a spec you built in to. My builds were always Shaman and Druids. Sometimes a tank. The tank would go in first, get beat up, make sure the enemy is on them, then the dps ambushes. In this you could clearly see these guys just went full blown zero strat which never really worked until then kiddies bitched they couldn't face stomp a dungeon in a few minutes. 
---
I'm going to enjoy this way more than I should.
---
No. It's not. But okay
---
Check the classic forums. People keep saying they are getting in every hour or 2 theres a new post from someone claiming to get in.
---
I think it's definitely aspirational, but with splitting out the time and gaining rested I think 6.5 days is doable for those who know their routes and practiced. What are you predicting for yourself?
---
when they say game time. that means your sub does not have to be active. but you need to have some play time left on it the sub you ad.  
---
for example. you pay $15 right now and activate a 1 month sub. you then cancel the active sub. even though your account is not currently active. You still have the 30 days game time left to use. If you use the 30 days game time and no invite comes. Then 31 days later. you will not be eligible.
---
bruh im desperate to play this shit at this point, I was saying anything that could possibly persuade the GM to slide me an invite, which I figured was near impossible but I have nothing to lose lmao
---
Yes I am aware.  
---
The OP is asking having new graphic settings and cosmetics (character model) should be implemented as it in no way affects gameplay.  
---
Your comments replying to OP:
---
&gt; If you're too thick to realise that, it's ok, but don't expect me or anyone else capable of differentiating their elbow from their anus to care.  
---
The use of 2nd person pronoun implies you're forcibly telling the OP that it's unwated.
---
Ok. Have fun dogg
---
Just saw the part of the stream I missed (had to leave half way through). Amazing!! Really heartwarming moment at the end of the Deadmines run.
---
yes to all of them, pvp is only default enabled in contested zones for pvp servers, pve servers you have to toggle pvp on. Excluding bgs
---
Treat the approach the same as it was back in the day. Merge servers regular way.
---
Everyone is nochanges, then this proposed idea gets introduced that ruins immersion, player experience, and is exploitable, and suddenly everyone loves it? Lol
---
By the time most are 60 the layering will be put away with, so with what exploitation will happen by then I'm sure will be small scale, I doubt most people would give half a shit to doing that for money, when they still need to level up. It's easier to farm in raid gear at 60 compared to quest greens at 38. But hey I may be missing something but I don't see it as game breaking or totally huge. Game economies normalize eventually. Especially with gold sinks like mounts, some professions, and getting mats for raiding.
---
wrong.
---
You were looking at #1 in the US but fortnite was higher globally. It pays attention to where you and the viewers are.
---
Get the +frost damage staff at lvl 20-25 from a wetlands quest, it will last you until lvl 40 or so. Before that it doesn't really matter. Your weapon is just another gear piece for casters, only gives you a bit of stats. The damage on your weapon does a huge chunk of the total damage of rogues and warrior, so they have to really make sure it's always up to date. 
---
A wand progression chart would be interesting for casters though.
---
"From my understanding"
---
I work in CS, agents understanding of policies is generally fucking awful. This doesn't really prove anything.
---
Gotta make money somehow.
---
I do? So do several of my friends and I'm sure there are plenty of others that have been subbed since vanilla.
---
Remindme! 4 months
---
Why does everyone even care about playing the beta? I personally don‚Äôt get it. We all know whats coming, we‚Äôve played the game.
---
Yeah. I got the Annual Pass, but I somehow manage to get an invite to almost every beta from Blizzard since Wrath era. I beta tested D3, SC2, Overwatch, and Hearthstone, and was part of the HotS Alpha test. I think the only beta I didn't get access to was BfA.
---
And out of all of the, the Beta for Mists was the only one that I had to actually decide to STOP participating in because it just became not worth my frustration to deal with all of the entitled sightseers that didn't understand what beta is all about
---
Uncooperative I think is the better terms. Retard is someone who's a slow learner. Frustrating to play with, but not necessarily intentionally.

Lol they both potted.
---
Asmongold is the people's champ.
---
Right? I think this guy is obnoxious and annoying to listen too.
---
Ever see that south park episode? That's him. Basically. Lol.
---
They both potted. The rogue potted when he was jumping down early in the fight.
---
Should we tell him that rares are hitting like wet noodles right now?
---
If you're crit capped (so not counting stormstrike), you have 90% flurry uptime.  You get 2 ap per str and that's all; more crit equals more damage plus more flurry uptime which itself makes crit more valuable because more wf procs etc.
---
Thanks! :)
---
The posts saying ‚Äúclassic wow isn‚Äôt real wow‚Äù make me laugh.
---
Three dodges lol
---
So...  their underleveled tank has 3 broken pieces of gear and people are surprised when he dies? lol
---
smells bad, feels great.
---
Now, WoW is behind the Let's Chat in views.  
---
  
---
It's all well and good it had great initial buzz, but what will say more is the active player count 8/27/20.
---
OH NO NO NO
---
Except one can be completed, the other will keep being just another content patch.
---
Given enough time and any reasonable rationing of game time, you can get a player completed in classic you max the reps get all the gear max the level max the gold whatever.
---
 In that amount of time in retail you‚Äôve gone through several raid tiers potentially an expansion or two, and now you have 6 times as much stuff to grind through, your server player base is spread thin everyone is playing solo, running one of a hundred older raids and dungeons. 
---
But even more so there‚Äôs less cracks to fall through in classic. You want whatever item from one of the raids? Guess you‚Äôll join one of those guilds are work with people and interact. Maybe you‚Äôll play solo waterwalk into the ocean and just fish at night off the northern coast of teldrassil for no good reason. 
---
But classic is just as much a multiplayer game as retail, maybe more so.. but it‚Äôs a game that can end, a game that can feel complete.
---
BFA is pretty, it has depth it has so much to do, too much maybe, maybe not, but why does it always leave you feeling empty?
---
Well, not saying I never contemplated that idea but... no, probably not. ;)
---
Correct. You don't lose anything but time.
---
And I believe if you're on a PvE server, you don't get engaged in pvp in the open world. (Never played a pve server, so not for sure)
---
Honestly, play whatever you think you'll enjoy. The game is a lot more rock/paper/scissors in vanilla. Classes are unique, and not as watered down as wotlk and beyond WoW. For example; only rogue and druid have stealth outside of Nelf. Warriors are always going to run down a warlock due to fear immune skills. I suggest just playing what you like, and you might see other classes and may think you wanna reroll as that. I did this a few times myself.
---
Warriors have a difficult time lvling up. They're the main tanks pretty much 99% of the time. their DPS is pretty good later on, but outdone by mages/locks/rogues for the most part. Very strong for group pvp.
---
Rogues are extremely fun for pvp, and useful dps in raids. Never a bad choice. However, there will be a ton.
---
Hunters have mediocre DPS, but have an easy time lvling. They have a dead zone on their bow range, will be your big hindrance in pvp.
---
Mages are great all around. Good lvling, good pve dps, good pvp class
---
Warlocks I don't have much experience with, but I know their DPS for raids is great, and their lvling is easy.
---
Priest I have 0 experience with. On retail, my clans 2nd Grand Marshal was a spriest, and he was an absolute monster in pvp.
---
Druid lvls pretty well, typically a healer end game, sometimes a tank. Good tank for 5 mans.
---
Paladins lvl decently, typically a healer end game. Their ret and prot trees are very underwhelming.
---
Shamans I don't have much experience with. I believe they level decently, and are typically healers end game.
---
Hope my replies can help you a bit. It'll be a change for sure from any modern MMO
---
You say that, but there is something to be said about a game world that has areas off limits to everyone but the most hardcore players..
---
We haven‚Äôt seen anything like that outside of the Heroic bosses since TBC.. I feel like it added a lot of awe to the world - seeing people in gear that most couldn‚Äôt obtain was a sight to behold.
---
Now modern game feels like ‚Äúeveryone has to be special‚Äù which in reality makes no one special.
---
found a new pasta
---
tbh the prior messages with the GM gave me the impression that he/she didn't really know what they were talking about, I was in the (wow/account/not listed here) category for the live chat.
---
I think exactly this will happen, but in server specific discord‚Äôs.
---
IF? 
---
What self respecting dwarven hunter uses anything BUT a gun?
---
No matter what I reply here would be recepted well but yeah I agree with you.
---
But really though, false reporting sometimes for the sake of humor is a really minor offence especially compared to the exposure streaming the game does for it. It's the reason streamers got beta keys in wave 1 over potentially better beta testers but people are upset anyway.
---
Worst case scenario is it wastes a couple minutes of someone's paid time over there double checking damage values.
---
Personally, I feel y'all should get only Vanilla in all it's trainwreck glory.  No QoL, no updates, nothing.  It's what y'all wanted, so that's what y'all get.  But we all can't have our way.
---
I'm not so sure. People have grown up with the LEGEND of MC (even if it was a pretty meh raid). There'll be all sorts of people who want to see it first hand. 
---
Keep in mind too that streaming only was started to really be a thing around Cata's release. There's gonna be all sorts of people who want to watch some of these raids get streamed (I'd count myself in that group. Especially if they make a TBC-Classic or WoTLK classic.) 
---
But we'll see, I could be wrong.
---
To me it's more the fact that many of the best  potential testers would be vets who unsubbed a long time ago, so it feels pretty dishonest to call it a beta for testing purposes yet eliminate old school players in favor of streamers and publicity.
---
Wasn‚Äôt Naxx ran so little because it was released after BC was announced so everyone knew their epics would be almost immediately replaced by questing greens?
---
Yeah I'm still doubtful. Other people [have been claiming](https://twitter.com/count2classic/status/1128823099825315842) otherwise
---
I'm just learning about this guy. How did he get popular? Was he good at any aspect of the game?
---
[Here you go](https://youtu.be/fTnFuUUXHYk?t=522). I really get the impression that the 1.12 client that Tips downloaded already had a bunch of mods in it that he didn't even notice were installed.   
---
Later on in the video he also talks about how much harder the enemies are. Turns out the Pserver AI isn't nearly as good and a lot of the mobs didn't even have some of their abilities.    
---
Huh go figure. /s
---
Amazing

I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.

This kind of crap is just for the screeches "ZOOOMMMMGMGGGG THAT WAS AWESOME LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL GET REKT!!!!"
---
I will be so glad that reputation will be a thing again. I missed my server wide reputation of being the nicest guy online. Everyone knew Tuna the orc shaman who would give you 10 gold if you needed it. I loved helping people and having that mad respect. People just /wave to you and make it a point to say hi.
---
Anyone from OCE get a invite ?
---
You're just using circular reasoning to avoid providing any proof.
---
Person 1: "Smoking is good for you."
---
Person 2: "Literally nobody agrees with you."
---
Person 1: "Well then you have to prove that I'm wrong!!!"
---
That's literally what you're doing. Nobody agrees with you, you're the one who made the original claim, you've provided absolutely no evidence other than your own personal experience, and you're convinced that THEY'RE the ones who need to provide evidence.
---
YOU made the claim. YOU provide the proof. THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. Nobody has to prove anything to you, because YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE THE CLAIM. Why on earth should they be the ones to prove anything WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT IT UP? If I say, "Ret Paladins are the best DPS in Classic," I'm pretty sure everyone would disagree with me. And I'd have to give some evidence if I wanted to be taken seriously, because I'd be the one who said it.
---
And accusing people of playing on private servers is just a sad little distraction to, yet again, avoid providing evidence.
---
For the record, I don't really care who's best at leveling. But listen to yourself. "They made a claim I was wrong." Yeah? And? How come they need to prove something, but you don't? You started it. If you refuse to defend it, then your opinion means nothing, and you're just a troll. In my example up there, the anti-smokers don't have to prove a damn thing, because they're not the ones who made the original claim.
---
Same here. You started it. Either defend it, or stop talking.
---
Opposed to having starter-zone sharding as they said they would originally have.
---
Yep, it's half the reason Magister's Terrace in TBC was one of my favourite dungeons. It took the challenge and amped it up to 11.
---
Seems like it from anecdotes. All of the people reporting in this thread are '04 vets.
---
This so much, even having gear that was ridiculously hard to obtain made it all the more special when you got to show it off in-game..
---
Realistically outside of Mythic, this doesn‚Äôt exist anymore and mythic armour is just reskins.
---
Sadly Blizzard is not Miyazaki. It's highly unlikely.
---
I do agree with you it's inconsequential, but I'd rather someone false report with sincerity. Hopefully all the streamers keep the meme reports to a minimum.
---
At least the rogue was smart enough to immediately pop evasion.
---
Yeah hes a total loser. He thinks he knows how to talk to women, but if he has ever tried any of the dumb shit he says he would know it gets you no where with anyone worth going anywhere with.
---
Yeah fuck that, might as well demand the mouse emulate getting stuck from hair around the ball. We're not using 4:3 monitors anymore.
---
uhh stream man bad
---
that‚Äôs the spirit pops
---
Ferals can offtank very comfortably. I don't think anyone feels they should be main boss tanking unless they unreasonably outgear the encounter
---
Wait, do you not get to pick which class you play for beta? Or did I just miss read you?
---
Source?

Multiple posts on this reddit from CS who have access to development team

If you're desperate, why not have a sub when you know it is their main select criteria...?
---
Iirc when he first started making videos he had said he started playing in cata. But then switched to saying he played since vanilla.
---
Yeah, and people will be watching the first streamers getting to the raids. If those Asmongold and Soda for example are among the first, then they have the potential to get massive numbers. But if they get to the raids weeks after other people started streaming the raids they won't get all that many more viewers than usual. And other people have a hard time getting as many views too because they lack a big following of their own.
---
get the step son to play with you
---
I was watching Sodapoppin‚Äôs stream and laughed so hard when he failed the WC jump twice.
---
BIS usually refers to "Best In Slot". Mainly talking about the best item you can have equipt in each slot . 
---
But it has since become a common term for describing anything that is "the best" for something.
---
Just checked my launcher and I'm installing Classic right now! Not streamer &amp; definitely not a content creator, but I've had a WoW account since Dec. 2004. Also played WC3 well before that, but not sure if that counts.
---
Hunters are God‚Äôs in world pvp and make rogues their bitch.
---
Reminder that unless you manage to bump your ticket to a superior, current Blizzard GMs are 90% outsourced personnel who have zero idea about how the game and anything to do with it works. Dont take anything from GM ticket as a fact.
---
The salt comes from the fact that you have to pay just to have a **chance** at getting into the beta, it's never been that way before.
---
Lol, that worked until he was about 12. Now he only wants to play online with his friends :).
---
I blame Fortnite...
---
&gt; but why does it always leave you feeling empty?
---
Cause you don't have a good guild :) 
---
Same happens with classic if you don't find nice people to play with.
---
It's gonna be funny when mythic race on retail end up overshadowed by someone clearing Stockade on Classic.
---
I agree
---
I was invited!
---
I like discord for communication, but using it for actually tracking data and making profiles is incredibly frustrating. I think there still would need to be a website of sorts.
---
I got an invite. Purchased wow on release day in 04.
---
That quote was not in response to the OP, but in fact to you.
---
Re-writing the code has absolutely nothing to do with the graphical aesthetics, which is why the originals are available as an option.
---
But i already did..i gave my reasoning for it... Not getting the evidence or whatever you want is not my problem. Lmfao. Dont know know? If you dont like the answer you dont have to accept it. It really doesnt bother me it upsets you. Thats really all this is. People get upset. Again i said it comes down to the player. If you cant accept my input..YOU DONT HAVE TO. 
---
You people and your worry about internet points.
---
But i wasnt accusing people of playing on private servers you moron. MOST OF THE INFO ON THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW ABOUT VANILLA WOW IS BASED ON PRIVATE SERVERS!!!! FACT!!!!! 
---
Again. I DO NOT HAVE TO DO SHIT. So you can spout off your fake ass argument because it doesnt fucking matter. Life isnt a courtoom and that is going to be a hard fucking pill for you to swallow. Lmfao. 
---
I hope you arent attending law school.
---
Because some people will bitch about anything as long as it doesn't suit their exact tastes.
---
Said the guy commenting on Reddit in a thread about guys watching someone else play a game.
---
Super inception!

I have no idea what a rollertoaster is, but my mental imagery is fucking outstanding. +1

How do you know layering will be done? Ion said that some servers will have up to 10 layers. That‚Äôs 30k people. Big streamers will bring crowds in the thousands. On top of the other people on the server, some servers will have thousands more players than classic servers had. This will drastically change the game
---
I didn‚Äôt know if you needed to be subbed to get an invite or if you could get invited but needed the sub to play. I wasn‚Äôt trying to pay $15 just to get a chance to get selected, would obviously rather wait till I get selected and then start the subscription. And after clarification it looks like I have no choice but to sub just for a chance at beta, cause I‚Äôm not going to play bfa.
---
Nerfed in 1.12. Stoneform better
---
People in the same guild will generally be in the same layer by default. If they were to join a group for an instance, they would be shifted over. Say guild &lt;Douchenozzles&gt; is tied to layer 1, at the moment, and guild &lt;Serious name&gt; is tied to layer 2. Guild member from &lt;serious name&gt; starts a Scholo group and invites some people from &lt;Douchenozzles&gt;. Even though all the guild of Douchenozzles is defaulted to the first layer, they get shifted over to the 2nd when the other guild invites their players. 
---
And as far as exploits go, I‚Äôm sure blizzard can work some way to make layer hopping less viable of a method of abuse. They listened to the community about loot trading, and we have a very good compromise with that now. I don‚Äôt ask for zero layering, I just hope it gets diminished quicker rather than slower.
---
On my RP server there ended up 4 alliance side raid groups and a couple of horde. Alliance side had two raiding guilds, an alliance of a half dozen oceanic guilds and night owl Americans, and a group called the Leftovers, that was exactly like the group you describe.
---
I think there were a couple of others too but those were the ones that made any kind of progress. I know the raiding guilds made it at least as far as c'thun and pretty far into Naxx(I don't remember if they finished Naxx or not) 
---
I was an american nightowl raiding with the aussies and we got most of the way through AQ and downed a couple Naxx bosses before TBC dropped.
---
I think I actually remember the names of both guilds lol. And definitely remember my raiding alliance. Those were good people.
---
Gear broken, charges in, healer is oom, group wipes since tank didn‚Äôt wait for healer to drink? Am I missing it or is that it?
---
They are, because they all represent things that are widely considered advances by most players.
---
Yea.. I've seen that one, but there's unfortunately little to no feedback other than a color system. Hopefully we can get more information soon
---
Good point. That's fair.
---
Tips is a cancer on the community. He‚Äôs not someone Blizzard should be promoting in any way.
---
&gt; I cannot see how having more polygon of an existing object is going to make a difference  
---
Well, that's not at all what the new models are.  The new ones are awful to look at, they are completely different.  And they are not at all vanilla.
---
Time lots of free time
---
Ran a M+ with him in retail, and he was awful. He died multiple times as a tank not using mitigation apparently since the healer had to spam heal him. I checked out his stream and he was bitching about us non stop and missed multiple taunts while trying to entertain his stream.
---
Thank you for your reply! I think I'll go with a mage to start off. I've only ever played pve so maybe I will give pvp a go this time and see if I have more fun on it. Looking forward to August to give this new old game a real try!
---
Poor guy getting exposed üòÇ
---
It's a valid concern but realistically you're only looking to avoid streamer servers, what other server would you want to avoid? Streamer servers would most likely be high population already so you wouldn't merge into one.
---
It exists in BFA too. Turn WM on, zone in, die.
---
this the 1st weeks, we can assume that the server populations will be high and we can all group questing fairly easily. So i was thinking of doing a not best lvling spec for what ever class i pick. why not pick the healing spec of my class? why not try balance? lets lvl Destruction, acrane, or what ever else. this is a good opportunity to do not the best optimal.
---
Quit wasting peoples time with these questions everyone is aware
---
Is there some kinda petition we can sign or riot we can participate in to get Jo in on the beta?
---
Could tell by the horde banners behind him
---
&gt; I can confirm that I will spend more time leveling then I have playing BFA total.
---
I can confirm that I will not. Think I have 40 days played in BfA or something like that. 
---
&gt;Yeah but new expansions retain us for 2 months whereas Classic will be 2 months to 60, then months of T1 T2 and T3 with plenty to do in-between.
---
But how often will they "update" classic though? We get somewhat regular patches in retail, that keep our attention for a while, aside from the initial launch and levelling (similar to the initial launch of a retail expansion) I don't see classic keeping peoples attention for much longer than they would with any other WoW expansion. Just because you can raid MC every week doesn't mean you actually play the game that much. If you don't like PvP for example there really isn't all that much to do at lvl 60 in classic.
---
YAH BABY. Here is 60 seconds instead of 30

As you can see Druid is hands down the least represented here followed by Hunter. You have to remember to double the numbers for Shaman/Paladin due to faction restrictions.
---
Are you going to be on a PvP server? That is the main question. That will help you decide which class. 
---
I played beta all the way to Pandaria xpac. I came back for WoD xpac.
---
Anyhow, back then hunters were a free kill for most classes, especially warriors. At least until you finished your dragonstalker set. Then it was super fun as a hunter.
---
This is my perpetual state of being since the beta was released.
---
I think the streamers are just really slow, I know a guy who did 1 to 20 in 11 hours on beta. It's 10% slower at most.
---
Ding ding ding.
---
Adding that they were mostly lower level from elite.
---
He's been playing on pservers as horde for a long time, I've seen him in game. I don't understand how he can still be so bad with lots of recent experience.
---
Yes. Being dropped into that huge, immersive world for the first time is more impactful in classic because everything feels dangerous. Just play it by ear, explore, and have fun. You can always respec and get a proper build later.
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games until you get stuck in the window portal for Molten Core.
---
My life is worthy of it's own book.  If I didn't have adhd I might actually write it.    The amount of misfortune I've had since 2014 Is nothing short of incredible.    However I can still afford the sub fee.  I mean.  40,000$ in debt since being debt free in 2014.   But the sub fee wouldn't make a dent in that anyways.
---
Hope some of those people stuck around. 
---
I feel like most WoW players at least *know* of Asmon but maybe dont watch enough to understand his persona. 
---
The guy is an incredibly gifted entertainer. Glad we have him in the community
---
Nice back pedalling, brotha.
---
Classic WoW is based off 1.12. Sorry.
---
It's especially strange when you take into account the fact that they're using the opposite logic for the mount training system. 
---
They're opting for the pre-1.12 system because that was the bulk of classic.
---
Imo they should implement cross realm bgs in phase 5 or something. Or at least early on have some special system where cross realm bgs are only the rare exception for the realms that really need it since many won‚Äôt at the beginning.
---
It's silly how happy this makes me.  I know it shouldn't matter that people love the same thing I love, but I'm so ready for classic.
---
I would definitely be interested in this! 39, love healing, PVE is the best.
---
What if I don't see any regions? I only see the "install" button and no drop down to see the regions.
---
So all wow twitch streamers have beta access. 
---
Jup this is how you pretend you have a beta , its obvious its just a PR event, obvious bugs shown on stream and not reported , not inviting people who actually played vanilla, these classic cast players are the worst pretenders playing tbh , is blizzard really so retarded that they don't understand that esfand and staysafe is just grandma players. they are the worst kind of players , just because they was helped to changed a file so they could connect to a private server does not mean that they actually played or can play a game.
---
So just turn it off...
---
It will be interesting to see
---
Thanks for the post! I had all but given up, but juat got in. I also have an older account from Jan 2005
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs mentioned, but people can request to join your group
---
Where‚Äôs the hunter bow progression
---
just because it wasnt in vanilla doesnt mean its a bug, by that logic the battle net friend system being implemented into classic must have been a bug right?
---
obviously not
---
Yeah, I remember we got pretty far too. I wish I still had my old account so I could check.  (No idea what happened to it, current account only goes back to 2010). I specifically remember setting foot in Ony, MC, ZG, BWL...unsure if I got into AQ. I wasn't the best geared. Was a mix of Dungeon set, t1, and I think one piece of T2. Was working on the epic bow quest.   
---
I was on Earthen Ring U.S, Alliance. Female Night Elf Hunter I think named Tasandra with a nightsaber named Putz. The guild I was in was called Arctic Wolves I think but didn't really push content so I used the sign up forum with a bunch of randoms all the time. Still had a wonderful time with it.   
---
 I retired her when BC came out for a gnome warlock named Alexandri and rolled her on Moon Guard when it launched and a guild called Uniden Pro.   
---
Ah, fun times.
---
WoW isn't hard, that will be fine.
---
Only preparation I'd suggest is what I'm going to do. Run all errands, do all chores and make sure everything is in a good, clean condition. Meal prep some soup/stew/rice &amp; vegetables.
---
I'm older now, things need to get taken care of. But I also know myself, new games I'm really into can sometimes pull me away for a few days/weeks. Plan for it. :)
---
Haha that's a snarky thing to ask, of course it doesn't count
---
All to ppl with active subs?
---
My God, I thought I was the only person who knew about that bug in Vanilla.
---
I did ask one of my pserver veteran guildies, and they said the bug was fixed on those servers. But since it was still in effect as of 1.12 in Vanilla, they may leave it be.
---
Yikes. I feel bad for your family.
---
Well, considering shadowmeld breaks the second you move...
---
I know the pain, but fuck it man. This was my teen years. I'm 30 now, wife, kid, etc. Just play when you can and enjoy the ride.
---
If the layers were all located within a single server it wouldn‚Äôt really scale it much from a performance perspective, would it? It‚Äôs probably horizontally scaled across multiple server instances.

It's funny, I avoided starting WoW on launch because I knew I would get too addicted. Ended up starting in TBC anyway and, well, here I am lol. Wish I had just said fuck it back then.

Jesus I‚Äôm gonna just agree like I know what you‚Äôre talking about hahahaha

Can you transition into pvp or is it solely PvE and PvP split up

He has never really made claims of being good though, has he?   
---
I just enjoy his enthusiasm.
---
Nah.. just not the target audience. I like watching streams sometimes after hard work days because I'm too tired to play or while I'm making dinner. Time to time I'm happy to donate money as a recognition of an entertaining value. Like other people pay for movies, music or books.
---
Well, considering shadowmeld breaks the second you move... it will be a good help in PVP. Definitely worth it. It's like a 1 yard difference, but that 1 yard when they're 4 yards away is huge.
---
But as for raid mobs, you don't get to shadowmeld by them unless they wander past you on their own.
---
I think Gnomer, RFK, Graveyard, and Library can be done. I don't know about Armory or Cathedral.. who knows.
---
4 yards is 3.66 meters
---
I played in a casual raiding guild in Vanilla. We basically just did the 20 man raids although I feel that with improvements in all the tools that will be available for planning and researching it will be easier to have players be ready to raid.
---
I remember hearing about this game back in 2004 and everyone including myself dismissed it because it looked childish and easy, so i stuck to playing quake3 (no regrets there, best fps game). Its cool that now i can try out this game (never played ANY wow before) starting from original, but now on a much better pc and internet.
---
Gnomer would be pretty would be hard but doable. Same with SM graveyard. Both their end bosses are lvl 34.
---
SM Library has a Lvl 37 elites end boss. I think that would be impossible. Obviously anything above that like Armory/Cathedral would be impossible.
---
PEOPLE WANT TO SHOP HERE
---
I dont even want to participate in the beta, but it really doesn't make sense to make the beta exclusive to current retail WoW subscribers. That's not this games player base.
---
I kinda hate asmon but shit at least he‚Äôs generating hype
---
People are definitely chasing nostalgia it's whether or not it will deliver. Chances are it won't and that's just because people who played this a ton are in a different phase of their life.
---
I agree.
---
my boss said " yeah go play your kid games for a week ill handle it"
---
Hey dude, let me be there first to say, I played way too much back in the day. I used to work at a lan center so be and about 20 of my closest friends lanned every day. 
---
That being said, there is a different feeling of classic/TBC than the other expansions Imo. Part of that is meeting tons of people online and playing with them for 10+ hours a day. So don't worry about not knowing anyone. Play a tank or healer and you will likely be sought out. 
---
 Also, everyone should play classic. There is no better investment if your time/money. It really is great and solidified blizzard for a decade for a reason.
---
If you‚Äôre on a pvp server then both all the time. If it‚Äôs a non pvp server then its pve unless someone enables pvp on their character.
---
You forgot the part where the healer was dpsing the boss.
---
Mom dropped me off at the library and should have just let me stay home and play video games.
---
Yeah laptop and mouse is fine, laptop doesn't have to be that powerful.

Main thing is to be ready for everything so you don't have to get up in the middle of a raid [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRjjVtvxRMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRjjVtvxRMs)
---
This was magical today
---
You're right - you don't have to do shit. This is just Reddit. It's not some life or death situation. So I should clarify what I meant.
---
I don't care if you provide proof. The only context in which I care is if you want anyone to take you seriously. If you pop on here saying something that no one agrees with, then basically insult all of them and demand they provide evidence.... I mean, at best, it makes you look like an idiot who's ignorant of how a claim is supposed to work. At worst, it makes you a jackass who's just being a hypocrite. "You need to provide proof, not me!" Just... what? Saying you used to do it isn't proof.
---
So again, no, you don't have to do anything. Only if you want people to actually listen to what you have to say. I figure you've gotta care a little, since you brought it up in the first place.
---
But just going off of your posts, your lack of reasoning, your UNBELIEVABLY BLATANT HYPOCRISY, your grammar, and your overall tone, I can tell that "maturity" and "education" aren't your strong suits, since the moment I bring logic into it, you start calling me a moron.
---
So I guess... nevermind. I didn't realize I was talking to someone like... well, like you.
---
Apologies indeed. I had trouble going back up the post chain.  
---
&gt;People want to play the game they remember from 10 years ago. What's so hard for morons like you to understand after being told hundreds of times already?
---
That's what you meant to the OP. My prior statement stands.  
---
I don't think OP is complaining about the original, more like the option to have newer graphics.
---
Just people downplaying this or people saying wow gonna overtake retail.
---
Not all grass is itchy... Whats the fucking point of commenting if you have less than 10IQ?
---
You know what? I don‚Äôt give a fuck about micro-updates to ‚Äúkeep players attention‚Äù - this is going to sound harsh but Vanilla came from an era of gaming were you didn‚Äôt need constant fluff being added to the game.. That same era we played games like Oblivion and CoD4. If modern WoW players have short attention-spans so be it but I don‚Äôt see Blizzard needing to go out of their way to cater a group of people who essentially want a button that releases dopamine into the brain. The instant-gratification era is here and its ridiculous, if you get bored of Classic WoW - you could always play another game. 
---
there is a timeline avaliable i‚Äôm pretty sure that shows how long between each phases
---
It's not any different from you paying for a cable package to watch TV shows. The only difference is that it's voluntary. You're showing your appreciation for the entertainment they provide. You could say "but he's too rich so why should I donate?" but that logic is no different than "well games companies make millions of dollars so why shouldn't I just pirate their games?"
---
He's not a millionaire but he's making a decent amount of money for someone playing video games all day. He has about 9k subscribers, which works out to about 32k/month. Half of that is going to taxes. And realistically his subscriber numbers aren't typically that high.
---
So best case scenario with inflated sub count he's probably bringing home about $200-250k/year. Which is a lot but that's not an insane amount for what amounts to a professional 10+year career salary. It's not like he's always been hitting such high numbers.
---
And here I've just been growing weed for release.
---
good bot.
---
You tell them WoW people your UoM facts!
---
Lol yeah everyone laugh at the pserver players now! We hold all the secrets!!
---
That's cool, do you remember the name of the mob?
---
Tip has always been trying to ride the classic wave for internet fame. He never played vanilla and doesn't understand it. His videos would take a shred of info and blow it up into a bunch of nonsense. He's nobody.
---
&gt; What I'd like to know is how noticeable is that extra level? Will that allow me to sneak by mobs in raids noticeably easier, and make it so enemies have to get even closer to detect me in PvP ?
---
I believe the latter is true, but the former simply doesn't apply, as shadowmeld only remains active so long as your character doesn't move.
---
He commented on that video noting that he made a mistake in regards to the quest arrows.
---
I never played Vanilla, but come on bruh. If I had played back then I wouldn't remember that shit, it was 14 years ago!
---
Cut the man some slack.
---
Don‚Äôt try to understand it.  It‚Äôs mass medium influence and marketing.  Twitch is literally evil incarnate.
---
This logic can be applied to so many things and it can be totally arbitrary and game-breaking.
---
For example, Rogues got their huge class revamp (with a free skill tree reset) in 1.12, which means most Rogue players aren't even playing the same class they played for most of Vanilla.
---
Nope - no email, I just checked my client.
---
I'm aware Classic WoW has the ability to switch to newer graphic. Does that include texture? Because if it could, it'd satisfy both parties.

Shadowmeld has a passive that improves Stealth/Prowl by 1 character level. So in this case I'm not actually using Shadowmeld but am still benefiting from it.
---
Spell batching.
---
Man, there's so many things that are wrong about that line of thinking. Just because you wanna take your time leveling slowly doesn't mean you should defend potential exploits, that doesn't make it okay and it will mess up your server's economy. Furthermore, like I said, it concerns people leveling casually, too. It's like having the option to roll the dice every time you need a certain mob to kill for a quest and it's down - you can just check the other **dimension** real quick to see if it's up there, then the next one, then the next one. And even if you're not doing it and being a good boy, others will be doing that. Everyone in the world around you phasing in and out like stupid. Enemies, friendlies, you run towards a mob and someone teleports in and steals it from you - stupid shit like that.
---
This is just sad
---
Because most pservers are wrong in almost every way... People are going to slowly realize how different pservers are to classic wow...
---
Ditto they have a plethora of them. Much more scarce in my memory than current beta.
---
I seem to remember this being brought up during the initial beta around Blizzcon, and then there was a blue post saying that it was actually the correct values and that private servers actually had it wrong.
---
Europeon confirmed.
---
92k and rising
---
I‚Äôll just hop to a different layer and group with a different 3,000 player pool.
---
People aren‚Äôt going to fucken keep track of each other.
---
most Pservers started banning for it or dumb stuff since it is pretty crazy advantage but it was a bug through Vanilla to my knowledge.
---
I never realized he was this bad at the game lol. Dude wasn't even autoattacking to help with dps
---
You‚Äôd have to pay your friends subscription if you wanted to play with them? Tell your broke ass friend to pay for it himself. 
---
But yes, you should play. Play alone if you have to. You‚Äôll make tons of friends and you‚Äôll get a lot out of the game. The replay value alone will pay for the subscription cost. 
---
And for real, don‚Äôt pay for anyone else‚Äôs subscription but yours
---
It's not going to be that bad.
---
Blind Hunter, from RFK as I mentioned Above
---
A poopsock
---
Man I thought you were talking about in-game things to do!
---
How do you get it?
---
Lunapic is so good. Have used it a ton
---
If you‚Äôre really hyped why not try out a PS?
---
Why do you think dwarves are so short?
---
Let me in! Let me iiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!
---
Sorry meant that to be aimed towards OP. My mistake
---
I'd like to avoid the mega pvp server.
---
It's in the title of the post.
---
Do you have any links to where people are downplaying this? I can‚Äôt find any
---
Yeah I think Gnomer and SM GY. 
---
I think with enough buffs and \*twinked (heh, level 30 twink is a strange concept) gear, SM Library should be doable as well, but it'd be pretty epic, and you'd have to get the hell out of that fire nova every time or else it'd be a wipe for sure. 
---
I think Armory could be done, Harod can be kited quite a bit if I recall correctly.
---
Donations?
---
36 here, single, no kids, work 40 hours a week. Its doable...
---
It took me almost a year playing probably 15-20 hours a week ... had friends who did it in about 3 who literally played 8-15 hours a day
---
The most interesting thing is that very few people did Naxx, which means very few people had full Naxx gear, especially in PvP where apparently (according to the P-server meta) it was totally balance-destroying.
---
I'm eager to see what happens when Naxx is out for much longer and people actually gear up with all that incredibly OP gear. Lots of specs become OP, like Survival Hunter (all because of one talent: Lightning Reflexes = +15% Agility)
---
I actually had the Blind Hunter on my alt in Vanilla, so I can 100% guarantee that the bug existed all the way until BC.
---
Sorry, should've been more clear. Shadowmeld \[has a passive effect\]([https://classicdb.ch/?spell=21009](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=21009)) that improves Rogue's Stealth and Druid's Prowl by 1 character level. So in this case I'm not actually using Shadowmeld but am still benefiting from it.
---
They could be exaggerating on how much of it is automated, but I recall a post or interview answer or something that I'm fairly certain they implied that the invites aside from their white list of content creators are going out based on an automated algorithm that selects and invites people as they need to fill it up more. I should try and find it again to check, but I wonder if it's actually 100% automated based on how many players are on the server at what level in what continent ect or if they are just hitting a button to run the selector every couple of hours.
---
Tips wasn't prepared.
---
Why did shitstains like tips and soda get beta invited? Fuck off, blizzard
---
+1 would like to know too.
---
no classic is using legion or bfa client. vanilla addons will have to be written/ported to suit it
---
some people are just bad at games.
---
Exactly
---
Tell them you‚Äôre going in a cruise and taking prep.
---
Christ this game is going to be a cesspool of miserable failure. Good thing the disgusting streamers got their bets invites though!
---
Wand damage is legit
---
Thats good to hear there's extremely few accounts of it, I first experienced it in a Pserver had read back and hear 1-2 accounts so far that it was a Vanilla bug.
---
So hopefully we can see it maintained.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt give a fuck about micro-updates to ‚Äúkeep players attention‚Äù - this is going to sound harsh but Vanilla came from an era of gaming were you didn‚Äôt need constant fluff being added to the game.. 
---
Vanilla had 12 content updates.... 
---
&gt;if you get bored of Classic WoW - you could always play another game.
---
Yeah, like retail WoW. And vice versa. And I'm pretty sure Blizzard will make sure content releases for either are spaced nicely apart so players can jump between either as they get bored.
---
Just as some more info, there is a blue post on the classic beta wow forum that says "an automated system will add new testers to the WoW Classic beta Test as necessary." so I wonder to what degree it's just going automated now or are they still like hitting a button to send out a wave every few hours?
---
Tipsout did it to himself. He got so many viewers on twitch he never had and just burned out, lost his voice and started doing stupid shit like a douche
---
So you‚Äôre obviously not going to bed any more?
---
Sitting here realizing I will never get into the beta because I never get into any beta.
---
He needs to learn how to jump shot.
---
The game has no room for parody? What are you on about?
---
he saw a business opportunity with classic being released and has made different "discussion videos". Has an opinion on everything in the game even though he's evidently clueless.
---
Fucking burn!
---
in world of roguecraft they did testing with detect invisibility (not what you are talking about)
---
but it made about as close to no difference in actual combat as possible
---
having a higher stealth level may help you against other rogues on a rare ocasion but  i doubt its doing much against anyone else
---
Spamming frostbolt was the actual rotation back then. Same for warlocks and a few other specs. You didn't have enough mana regen to actually cast anything else.
---
Why is this upvoted? It's completely wrong in regards to vanilla
---
Shitsout baby!
---
Looks very christmassy
---
Ah. Couldn't tell you, then. It looks like that would be the case to me, but I'm far from any sort of mechanical ace.
---
Sound advice isn't shitting on people. Tanks are hard enough to come by while leveling and squishy tanks have ruined numerous runs. Some PUGs can handle it but many can't. One person can waste everyone's time and effort. That doesn't apply to the tank alone but they're the foundation of the group.
---
You know, I didn't really feel old during all the Classic announcements. But you've taken that away from me.
---
I'd buy this more if reddit weren't completely stuffed with typos that could only be done by people posting from phones
---
There was a guy named Amhai back in the MoP days (2012-2014) who gave a number of streamers $10,000+ each through donations. I believe the largest total to an individual was $30,000. The story was that he was the son of some Saudi oil prince.
---
So giving streamers inordinate amounts of money is certainly nothing new.
---
Depends how you look at it. I generally "tip" or donate to one of my favorite streamers (Ryukahr, if anyone interested) I'm tier 3 subbed. I don't pay for television, I do not pay for any other streaming service besides hulu. The majority of my entertainment is Youtube and Twitch. I know I personally wouldn't have content to watch without some streamers. So I pay them rather than a corporation.
---
This same thing happens in every single iteration of the game, please stop fronting.
---
ah man really? i guess between 12-15 they might not appreciate it. hopefully this changes again!
---
At least you'll have a shot at redemption. I was really the perfect age for Vanilla at 16. Rose tinted glasses aside, there really is a unique experience to Classic that WoW hasn't been able to provide since.
---
As far as I can tell, not many people respect or follow these streamers. They don't really bring much to the community. They are generally about themselves and money. Esfan, tipsout, staysafe, asmondgold, alexsensual etc. No salt attached, just facts. I prefer to watch people like Kargoz, madseason etc
---
Hi, /u/soramac
---
Or wait for the healer to stop looting and get mana before you rush into a boss that hits like a truck, and then don't be the healer who is casting moonfire on a boss that's known to 2shot tanks, then don't be 2 dps warriors who can't figure out how to chance into def stance and swap on a shield. 
---
Basically every single player in that group was among the worse vanilla players I've ever seen.
---
I politely disagree. Offensive chat or continuous, ‚Äúhurry up and get here‚Äù is a definite red flag, but if someone running around I don‚Äôt see it as negative. I‚Äôd rather someone slightly bored running around to entertain themselves than someone zoned out watching Netflix on monitor #2 who‚Äôll continue to do so the whole dungeon.
---
His fanbase is worse. Can't believe they support him after that e-begging stunt he did on here.
---
I don‚Äôt trust them enough. Not feeling like downloading a virus
---
Lol get wrecked. PvP happened on a PvP server oh no :(
---
that is not how any non-insane person in charge of developing retail would work
---
Not really rofl
---
Is everyone in the beta a streamer?
---
when did you sub?
---
i cracked a token about 24 hours ago 
---
are you located in america?
---
I‚Äôm pretty hopeful most of us will get a shot before the end of August. Good luck.
---
If it makes you feel better, everyone in the starting area was slow as shit tagging questmobs. Maybe we still got our reflexes :D
---
consider amassing that catalogue then publishing it after completed.  i was doing this with mass effect three on release but never finished recording all three
---
Other guy points out that water isn't really an argument, and the bushes don't matter since you can disable them on your end. The people who have the disadvantage would be those with the updated bush graphics turned on.
---
Only thing different in my life is I live alone instead of with family. I have no friends anymore and I've been single for years. Can't wait to dive into wow again for a little while like I did when I was 14 in 2004  before I end it all.
---
Uses a health pot, complains that someone used a health pot.
---
Pro.
---
Problem with Arm is the myrms are going to reck everything they touch including the tank
---
I watch streams for games I'm interested in buying, I'll watch for a few days, kind of like getting a demo.  Found a streamer on mixer that made the game enjoyable to watch.  So I subbed for 5 bucks, I'm out one coffee.
---
yes, rogues didn't get a debuff slot
---
didnt you need like cards for the trial back then
---
either way yeah im really glad people like you get to experience it.
---
Y'all are such freaks about streamers
---
Wow, both these guys are salty and annoying af
---
I would believe it. I just saw this. How does he say that?
---
https://youtu.be/CDXylJZuVLY
---
The text is smaller cause you're playing on 1920 resolution instead of 1080 like back in the day
---
Man I never see anyone when I have WM on
---
Glad I'm not the only one. I prefer to blame it on higher screen resolutions though...
---
I wasn't talking about WC specifically but I'd say that one is worth it. Doing all the quests is a boat load of XP compared to regular quests and some of the quest items are the best certain classes will see for many levels.
---
Some of the dungeons aren't as good for the level or are too big a pain in the arse for some people. But, dungeon quest xp isn't half bad in lower level dungeons.
---
Blood Elves are closer to High Elves than Void Elves though
---
It‚Äôs been confirmed since the first post about this 12 hours ago. Looks nice tho.
---
Welcome friend!! Take your time and savor it....or don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not your mum.
---
Not the people who weren't there.
---
Patch 1.7 increased debuff slots from 8 to 16. At some point(maybe earlier patch?) they also prioritized certain debuffs like Sunder Armor.
---
I'd have been very surprised if it wasn't in after all, but this confirmation is nice for putting that little bit of doubt to rest. I love the weather effects so much.

Fourth question down.
---
Ah, first I have seen of it :)
---
I don‚Äôt use twitch often but I do enjoy subbing/donating to the people with less than 100 viewers. They always seem to be the most sincere and appreciative
---
seems like accounts created around 2004/2005 are getting in. unlucky for me since I didn‚Äôt join during Vanilla, I‚Äôm a 2007 baby :/
---
Then you throw in donations and ad revenue
---
Amen, hallelujah, and peanut butter. The Centaur conflict was epic, and the entire zone was a very refreshing change of pace (even without a mount to speed around the steppes).
---
It's this subreddit's fault for catapulting him.
---
That‚Äôs what they are for even better to farm for tubers in felwood. Don‚Äôt know why people always complain about potting honestly use everything you have!
---
you can only opt in once so i guess once
---
Uhhh pretty sure this is wrong
---
I assume they don't want you farming gold for wow tokens on retail to fund classic while simultaneously playing.
---
Shaman are needed to give groups windfury, paladins are needed because they are amazing healers. You‚Äôd ideally want 3-5 paladins to get blessings covered (kings, salvation, might, wisdom, and light or sanctuary if you have 5+). Paladins make MC easy mode, having more dispels means you are not super reliant on having priests like horde is.
---
If you find one that actually has skill and doesn‚Äôt say things are ‚ÄúAIDS‚Äù constantly please let us know.
---
The real question is how many hours of trash clearing are you willing to watch?
---
It's really not but it can be confusing the first time or three, especially if a player has only ever followed others without really paying attention.
---
Barefeet in the grass is great for you, this is awesome
---
Only green I'm gonna be steppin' on is Orc neck.

Everyone knows what Coke is. Their ads try to create demand, which is different from awareness ads

I kinda miss cleaning out the mouse. That satisfying feeling after cleaning it and putting it back together, seeing that cursor move do buttery smooth again.
---
Lol tef, is OD going to play classic?
---
I hope so. I have 1 acct from Feb 2005 with 0 game time.
---
I have an Oct 2006 acct with 18 months of gametime.
---
Can I get the age prio for the untimed acct plz.
---
This is what I thought but I swear I have heard people say that they got like 7 / 30 bnet accounts invited by adding 8 accounts per bnet or something, which suggested that they each count as a separate entry? IDK
---
Yes, indeed he never did. Tips is very likeable and I also enthusiastic. I do watch his Youtube videos sometimes.
---
He sure makes a good buddy to have fun with. But not as Raidleader pls. ;)
---
TIL
---
You did need cards back then but I remember my brothers and I had a few each. Not sure how we got them tho.
---
It's not going to be that mega if it needs your realm to merge into it.
---
Thanks dad
---
Classic wow is a Reboot.
---
They don't have to do everything exactly the same. 
---
Calling it now TBC is coming.    With no flying mounts, and no LFG.
---
Thats the question, my late Vanilla account is the one I have game time on, but I have a VERY early Vanilla account without time, wondering if I am screwed, LOL
---
yah, making it worse because he is trying to tank. if he would have rolled dps it wouldn't be so obvious
---
id prefer this functionality 
---
last thing i want is doing content in either game and having people afk while they do something in the other.
---
pick one and play that
---
For me it's just a cap on northern barrens. Getting the sword. As a rogue it just speeds up future mob grind on harpies and stone talon mobs.
---
maybe watch the clip next time, he was smiling at the end
---
You need to be opted into both apparently
---
or the ones labeling it 'retail vs classic' when classic will become retail as soon as it launches.
---
That's hilarious! Haha
---
Right. Im not a fan of most of the terrible streamers but it's wayyy more effective than 1 person playing by themselves and no one seeing it
---
Thank you so much for the advice!
---
Seriously, why are they all so bad?
---
What you don't realize that a significant number of the donations get refunded. People just want to be seen in front a crowd.
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] ???
---
yeah i think the game came with several to like refer people
---
think you could buy them at most game shops or they gave them out
---
lol most of my gaming growing up were like game demos that came with pc mag's
---
Herod is level 40, and the trash alone will give you so many issues, especially for the tank.
---
Located in America, West coast.
---
Was subbed from vanilla through pandaria then on and off after that usually just to check out an expansion launch. Just resubbed when I got news of the beta.
---
Why would we need to voice our opinion? It's a discussion for how classic content should be treated on that sub. It has nothing to do with this sub. The discussion should be between people who frequent /r/wow and not something we need to brigade.
---
Druids don‚Äôt have wands
---
Whoooosh?
---
From what I recall from vanilla raiding is slow high damage (not dps) main and then the OH is highest dps you can find (usually fast). Is that accurate for raiding?
---
The Classic community overwhelmingly does not want it to progress. If we get anything it will be new Classic content. 
---
Just look at OSRS. Can you imagine if they progressed into RS3? It would have died years ago.
---
Just like Classic will die if we start progressing.
---
He didn't even have shield block on his bars  
---
it's baffling
---
Vanilla requires smart plays. CC targets. Freeze groups of mobs. Silence enemies. Theres ways to make it work. This isnt retail you cant just afk in a fight and come back fine.
---
Hang in there! I‚Äôm still rooting for you
---
They aren't very well off financially and they don't want to spend the little money they have on a game their not sure they want to play. Do you know if trial accounts will be able to play on Classic servers?
---
Druids don't have wands. He was wasting mana to wipe the group
---
This is the reason RP servers are so aclaimed.
---
Most of us never actually RP, we just really really love getting 
---
HotTitsSixtyNiNe banned for posting retarded twitch memes in chat.
---
How old are you and what year is this? You sound like some old normie boomer when twitch became a thing.
---
I'm with you on this, especially when they stop playing the game for 5+ minutes to interact with their phone.
---
teah i checked if i could opt in on the second one but you dont seem to be able to
---
you've inspired me to make my own, thanks for the idea!

A little redbull might be on the menu tonight haha
---
Haven't seen any rain outside of the wetlands
---
Not saying the others weren't at fault. My statement was meant as general advice for the entire leveling process. Level matters a lot more at early/mid game since gear is pretty weak.
---
Not just talking trash either; I follow my own advice. I've done the vanilla dungeons more than enough times as tank, healer, and dps to have learned my lesson. With a premade group of friends or guildies I'd be more willing to try a dungeon at a lower level but with a PUG it's just asking for problems.
---
I only called out the tank because they're the foundation of the group. Even as DPS I avoid doing dungeons until I'm at or near the level of the greatest boss it contains. Basically, once ALL the quests are yellow, though that's not always a good indicator.
---
All that said, there are going to be new players as well and they'll find out first hand unless they go look everything up first.
---
He charged in like a numbnuts while his healer was far away and then he turns his head to read twitch chat like he's fighting a random mob, the fucking streamer bab gets rekt. gold
---
Don't forget the boots...and humans anti-stealth racial.
---
I mean it makes the most sense to invite the accounts of people who actually played classic.
---
Nobody knows how layering works yet, but we *do* know that it doesn't work like *that*.
---
Slippery slope
---
I'd assume potions are pretty rare at the moment
---
The Bnet is opted in but each wow account might count a another raffle ticket under that Bnet, does that make sense? I hope it doesnt work this way but I swear I have heard people say it does
---
Damn, that web site was like a trip back in time.
---
Everyone gets old.
---
Almost no one grows up.
---
yea pretty sure thats  like the golden ticket

Did it happen in every zone? I think it was only certain ones no?
---
never said it didn‚Äôt make sense, I‚Äôm just bummed that I was only off by two years or so haha
---
Yeah from what I‚Äôve seen, only people with accounts created in 04/05 are getting invites.
---
Sad time for me since my current account was created in 2012 :(
---
Will it show up on your blizzard account main page also? Just in case I can't be around my PC and need to leave work sick one day...
---
Playing a shaman on beta now. Is anyone else noticing a delay in exiting and entering the radius for their totems?
---
This is exactly right. And friend/guild groups are far more likely to be prepared and coordinated. My advice is for PUG groups specifically.
---
literally zero people have those right now. The beta is brand new and capped at 30
---
lol "abusing"
---
Not even gonna try to get into the servers until mid September
---
shill
---
TELL US WHY YOU"RE CLOSED, WHY WHY WHY ARE YOU CLOSED, I WANT TO GO SHOPPING IN THE EATONCENTER
---
Very worrisome
---
No.
---
It will release as scheduled. This shit always happens in betas, which is why Classic needed a beta. They have three months to crowdsource the error-sniffing. You'll get your game on the 27th.
---
why would they push back the release? they have plenty of times to fix the bugs
---
Don't listen to him. I have a half dozen weather mods for Skyrim and sometimes I'll reload a save where it's just a fucking torrential downpour, just so I can chill under a covered porch while the rain and storms go on. 
---
We just some emo bois I guess, idk. I love the rain though, irl and in most games.
---
It's not flawed logic, at all. A Ret paladin can buff just as well without ever getting loot, so that's no reason to justify giving them, say, DFT, BRE, T2.5 Tokens etc. It's still a waste, and other people will get upset.
---
Not at all! The things that are "broken" are fairly easy to fix and most arent really game breaking anyhow so
---
Very few pots exist to be used, atm
---
uuuuugh harpies. probably third place behind murlocs and naga for most irritating mob type.
---
And yes, that sword is awesome, as is the staff for those that use them.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any more bugs than they were expecting. There is a reason beta is so long, as they have plenty of time to fix these things before release. I‚Äôm sure it will be fine
---
No invite yet account from 2005 EU, almost all expansions and current sub.

Trial accounts are a high possibility but your friends shouldn‚Äôt be playing this game if they can‚Äôt afford it and/or if they have pressing life concerns. This game is easy to get addicted to and very easy to spend time on. It‚Äôs just that good. Just play by yourself and let them use free trials.

---
I know it's not a 1:1, but as soon as content gets stale in the Everquest "classic" servers, people drop off - quickly. 
---
That being said, there is one particular server that is locked in the "classic" era that has a super high population as well, so it's possible it could continue to boom and with the target audience, it's not like there is any inherent benefit to starting all over on another server vs starting a new character.
---
It will be interesting to see how the playerbase moves, and how the population does!
---

---
Probably referring to this.
---
:thinking:
---
really? Damn, I got in the first wave on that one, and I didn't even want it
---
What do I need to play classic? Just the current expansion for Retail!?!?
---
Get all the necessary classes for debuffs, stack as many fury warriors and warlocks as possible.
---
Laugh at people thinking they can play some meme spec.
---
Hi, /u/PawnStarRick
---
Asmon had this discussion during his stream.  Asmon and McConnell referred to it as DM and Esfand referred to it as VC.  Asmon mocked him, the chat laughed, and then agreed.
---
Calling it VC is just....wrong.  Nobody on my server ever did.  Maybe it was a niche NA thing.
---
Hi, /u/Gofarman
---
I don't know what he's talking about, but don't know that he's wrong. Did you update your beta preferences to opt into the classic beta?
---
shit how do i see when my account was created? i think i‚Äôm 2006..
---
The thing is, they can be very smart about it and allow self-imposed progression. Want to stay in Classic? Stay! Want to progress to BC? Opt in via this tool, at which point you'll be launched into the BC server... Oh, WOTLK is out? You can stay in BC or move forward.
---
That would be a winning solution, in my opinion, but I could see how it could also lead to community fragmentation.
---
Just a subscription
---
Yeah - the more I see of the beta, the more optimistic I am. So if layering is there only for a few weeks I would be content.
---
Even though I'm used to private server "elite" rare mobs, I remember rare mobs in vanilla being similar in strength to normal mobs.
---
The new models only look good with new animations, the game will have older animations no matter what so the model change is kind of useless.
---
If you can't look at the quality of the game beyond aesthetics then don't play.
---
If you give an inch they take a mile, today cosmetics tomorrow something else and it will be retail once again.
---
#nochanges
---
Nah that's just what happens when you don't have enough fiber in your diet.
---
Fuck
---
My hype just reached uncontrollable levels
---
If there are major bugs or exploits then the game should be delayed. That applies to ALL games and Classic is no different.
---
For minor stuff they'll just patch it later. Players dealt with a bunch of weird stuff back then and they can do it again.
---
I did yeah, but I don't have an active sub and am on the fence about whether I should pay for a month to see if I get access to classic or not. And I don't want to throw 15$ away on something unconfirmed.
---
No, because most of the bugs and shit aren't even bugs, people just think private servers were accurate and they weren't.

I started by doing Southsea Freebooters and Wanted: Baron Longshore from Ratchet. Most of the mobs in the camp granted 5 Ratchet reputation per kill (Southsea Brigands and Southsea Canoneers). Tazan (quest mob for a rogue quest) gave no reputation, and Baron Longshore granted 25 Ratchet reputation. For all of these kills the spillover reputation for the other Steamwheedle Cartel factions was 50%. This was matched by turning in the quests (I got 175 Ratchet rep for turning in both quests, plus 87 rep with Booty Bay, Everlook, and Gadgetzan).  50% seems pretty high, but for all I know it is what it should be.
---
After Ratchet I moved to do The Disruption Ends out of the Crossroads. This quest granted 100 Orgrimmar rep, with 25% spillover to TB, Darkspear, and UC. 
---
I followed that up by doing Apothecary Zamah (run some spore samples from Crossroads to Thunder Bluff within 45 minutes). I stopped along the way to do a grey quest in Mulgore called Dwarven Digging (character level 14, quest level 8). I received 100 reputation with TB for this, but no spillover or experience for this grey quest.
---
When I made it to TB, I turned in Apothecary Zamah for 75 UC rep, 25% spillover to the other Horde factions. 
---
I did a few more quests for experience during this session and they all matched this pattern. 25% spillover for Horde faction quests, 50% spillover for Steamwheedle Cartel.
---
Graats to Skorch!
---
&gt; all sides should be happy
---
Have you seen the entitled autistic dumbasses on this sub that they want ‚ÄúeVeRyOnE tO sEe WhAt I sEe‚Äù? I‚Äôm hoping it gets integrated just as a middle finger to those idiots
---
Awesome. I hope you really have fun and enjoy your first experience with the original game. I'd suggest taking it slow, like others have, but it's fun regardless.
---
&gt; after being at 30% HP while killing a mob and having someone ambush you.
---
Wait, does world PVP happen any other way?
---
Ding time: [1 day 5 hours 34 minutes](https://imgur.com/a/Ks3tuuq)
---
Great, now we have an already small community split into 3rds. The Classic scene would die within a few years due to lack of players.
---
itt retards that apparently didnt watch the full clip and didnt see that he was smiling. but either way if you aren't raging after getting ganked you are doing it wrong. if everyone i ganked thanked me for it i wouldnt have nearly as much fun doing it. the ""rage"" should be praised if anything
---
Yeah okay, well first off you don‚Äôt lose that damage.  The talent gives you 25% damage bonus for 12 seconds for the next 12 melee swings when being crit.  You are assuming you will never be crit, which anyone who has actually played vanilla and not just private servers will tell you that it‚Äôs going to happen to you without glitching a mechanic such as this.
---
And even with that talent completely ignored (which you obviously did acting like being crit is a non option now) you still get a lot of damage from fury making it completely viable and at times better than arms and at times worse.
---
If you would actually like to discuss how things actually works on a vanilla sever I‚Äôm here unless you want to keep talking about how things work on p servers
---
" Uhh actually no that's incorrect, I would know because I was playing on Nost from the beginning."
---
Herbalism is great for druids. Roots, hibernate, looting in forms, mean that you rarely have to kill crap around the herb to gather it.
---
If you have the gold (it's about 115k now), you can buy a month without paying anything. But yeah, I wouldn't sub just to try to luck into the beta
---
Feral is justified and allows some gearcheck skips but it requires a godly player behind it with tons of investment in the character. Even then, only one per raid top.
---
Have I told you about how Blizzard is wasting their time developing Classic WoW?
---
Ill take my $100 and fuck off now, thanks
---
WORLD FIRST!
---
Im naming my boar perfectenschlag
---
From what I recall it's fairly minor. You'd notice a difference on occasion but I'm not sure I'd bother investing time in gear or enchants for it. The talents that give improved detection will give you an idea of how effective it is on the other end.
---
they are doing great work
---
If you don't use the sub and don't want to that's fine. Just calling attention to it because it's something that could affect people who play wow and frequent both subs.
---
It is possible that they work to get a single layer as an RP layer but it will eventually just be merged into the PvP server and will have been for nothing, probably not worth the time it would take.
---
Jesus christ use dark theme
---
https://imgur.com/a/dKUuKEu
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Grats Skorch! 
---
So glad everyone is having fun with the beta, god I can't wait until August.
---
Keeping people locked in content they are interested in moving on from is going to keep players, though? I don't get the logic there.
---
I mean, honestly, the classic community is not small. Based just on private server success, it's pretty fucking huge.
---
But, that's why you restart semi-regularly once content is exhausted. It keeps it fresh, and it draws back those players that may have felt like it was "too late to start".
---
You can't just do nothing and expect players to stay.
---
NOW, if they do custom classic content, that would absolutely nullify everything and would be awesome. Do we trust them to not bastardize the experience, though?
---
People are so hostile online
---
He had some shitty sob story about how he always wanted to stream wow but never got to and this sub gave him a bunch of pity points. He claimed a lot of things about playing since vanilla which have now been demonstrated to be false.
---
How do these clowns get Beta access ?
---
I wonder how different the private servers are from the current blizzard classic beta since people are doing sub 20 hours as hunters on repack and stuff. And there's been mages doing 1-20 in less than 8 hours so i'm curious how the top speedlevelers would do on beta
---
Everyone in chat agreed with Asmon because its Asmons stream.  Its possible calling it VC was a NA thing, but i only ever heard it called VC since the original beta
---
Dualwielding Vanquisher's and Thrash was so epic. Loved getting them on my rogue and even on my warrior, which I leveled as dw fury even though people never recommend it.
---
"Smarten up." ...oh no boys he got me.
---
Having a higher stealth level definitely reduces the radius for enemy detection. Been a long time since I've played a rogue, but I think 2 levels worth is enough to avoid detection from behind even against a paranoid lock or human or whatever, and that's really all you need... Since ya know, don't open from the front.
---
It wouldn't be that split because they would slow/stop content production for classic and move to TBC. Are classic players expecting them to make them new classic content for years to come?
---
slow/fast as others have said. One thing to remember is the classic sword combat rogue had a high proportion of white damage on a boss.
---
Slice and dice with the old sword spec talent gave a lot of MH procs with a fast OH sword.
---
According to this I will realistically ding 60 the day before I go back to work. Perfect
---
This dude is a fucking tool.
---
I legitimately hate anyone that doesn't like weather effects and semi-annoying night time brightness.
---
Right. They should wait for a later phase to see how the queues are going then add Xrealm if needed. Having it right out of the gate with BGs is a bit silly.
---
Skorch just hit 30
---
Having never been involved in the massive 40 man experiences, reading both yours and miyji's responses are really insightful.
---
This is an excellent point. A hybrid jack-of-all-trades almost certainly doesn't need loot over your tanks, healers, and dedicated damage dealers.
---
I generally really like playing these sorts of roles in games lately, so I have a question to ask. If someone was wanting to play one of these hybrid roles and was completely understanding and accepting they would almost never be handed a quality loot over another raid member, how do you feel about bringing them along then?
---
Yo is classic the ‚ÄúNo Changes‚Äù we all wanted ?
---
If classic has enough of a fan base to sustain itself it will.
---
You are literally saying "I want everyone else to be forced to play the version "I" like so that my version is stays more fun.
---
IF your stated position has any merit at all then Classic should be canceled at once to prevent the fragmentation of the retail population.
---
That which can be destroyed by the truth, should be... 
---
Likewise that which can be destroyed by competition, should be.
---
Who
---
I just realized I needed to have my beta opt in set for classic and I just made sure it was checked.
---
I‚Äôll just see it in the blizzard launcher if I get an invite?
---
I would not base your choice on something as far away and uncertain as Ashbringer. You will play most of the game without ever getting near it, so you may as well play the class you enjoy. A lot of people will play warrior, but if you're dedicated and research your class, you're already ahead the majority of them.
---
darkshore not ashenvale :)
---
Old School Runescape. Enough said.
---
Seems to me that quite a few details are off, and some of the routes developed on the private servers rely on dynamic spawns. I would be very interested to see Joana knock a run out though.

---
I just (noticed) I am in as well!  
---
Average Joe with active account and checked the beta interest almost as soon as it was posted.  
---
Ive been playing since vanilla active all the way through MoP and then off and on since then.  
---
Good things come to those who wait patiently!
---
I loooove nagas.
---
The ones in feralas in the cave on the island I farm a lot of
---
I think it's the decade of Paladin inside me talking. That, and my love for a game that I never got to experience to the fullest as a teenager.
---
Most raids will bring 1 spriest, but this is largely dependent on how many Warlocks that raid brings. Shadow priest is not a great DPS class and more than anything is around to buff warlock DPS with shadow weaving.
---
Yes. They already said they're open to it.
---
If Jagex can do it for OldSchool Runescape, Blizz can do it for WoW. Its not as big of a deal as you guys are making it out to be.
---
When in 05? I believe mine was aug 2005 and I‚Äôve been constantly reloading my launcher
---
Just remember how many hours he spent streaming to no one. It took a long time for his success, he definitely earned it with no guarantees it would ever pan out
---
$200k a year *after taxes* and that doesn't even account for donations or sponsorships or YouTube. I wouldn't be surprised if his real income was double that.
---
1 per raid perhaps i think to buff the warlocks
---
If Paladin speaks to you, you won't regret going Paladin.
---
its harder on pservers i guess because the waves come on timers whereas in the beta the next wave only comes after you kill the current wave. but yes the murloc is hard asf on pservers
---
You just have to have gametime, doesnt have to be a subscription
---
It's for retail mostly but who cares
---
As a person that has ZERO IRL friends that play MMOs I've had to go it alone quite a lot. My experience back in vanilla was that the social element eventually pushed me to interact with others on a regular basis and I made new friends online. Considering the way they're handling population control I'd think this will happen again.
---
Of course, not everyone will like every game and if it takes your friends to make it fun then it may not work out. But that's okay too. It's worth it as long as you're having fun, and when that comes to an end it's okay to move on...
---
I want to see commercials and ads everywhere. Not just Twitch streams
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it unless your account was created in 2004/2005.
---
Did you have BFA or just legion?
---
Joana is streaming as we speak!
---
Shadowpriest* will be brought to raids, if they don't decide to use a Holy SW spec instead.
---
Just another reason to get rid of flying in tbc
---
Worrisome
---
Some raids might make an excuse for spriest but doubtful that any top of server/hardcore guilds will.
---
No one fucking cares about world firsts in a beta where the focus is mechanics testing and establishing consistency / fact checking.
---
Be the first to report something and have a change actually made to the game. Then I'll be impressed.
---
of course they are.
---
probably during late t2 when 1warlock dps&lt;shadow priest dmg amp for other locks.
---
#getridofflyinginTBC
---
It seems to me that there is very little overlap of people who raided in Vanilla and people who raid Mythic on retail.  For some reason both sides want to shout the other side down that their experience is the harder one.
---
The simple truth is they are both hard, just for different reasons.
---
Grats ~about time they figured themselves out!
---
I've literally been saying this entire time that they could/will add new content to classic.
---
Your "do you expect them to do nothing" comment is not only ignoring everything Ive  said, but you're trying to get people to agree with you without reading the entire conversation.
---
He just got access and is streaming now!
---
It just feels easy because people have like 14 years of experience, especially the beta streamteam. They know how tanking works, they know which abilities to use... 
---
I know private servers arent accurate (most likely private servers were even more difficult) but if you ever run Molten Core again with a team of skilled people, lucifron will die within 40 seconds even with only 30 people in the rate.
---
People nowadays know to use pots, prepot, food, flasks, enchants, they know to put like shamans in melee and caster groups for totem support...
---
Yes if we let 40 people try it who never played wow before, they wont know how to tank properly and whatnot, but take 40 veterans and they will probably clear molten core on level 57ish.
---
I'd be laughing my ass off at that guy if I saw that bug report. Now I know why people give him so much shit here.
---
Finally, a level -1 DFD
---
Patience.
---
It's what will get you through difficult content, it's what will help you master your class, etc.
---
This is about the only change I approve because I also wanted this change in vanilla.
---
Info? Account age? Active subscription? Current expansion on your account? Content creator?
---
well crap that's really disheartening. Are there any potential builds that could help their dps? I hear they actually do good dps but just don't have mana issues.
---
Perhaps a human shadow priest that goes for as much spirit as possible for that 15% mana regen in combat in the disc tree?
---
Did they report any bugs or did they just sweaty through the entire leveling process?
---
I don‚Äôt get it, people are obviously eager to have classic. Why are people trying to down play it?
---
&gt; Keeping people locked in content they are interested in moving on from is going to keep players, though? I don't get the logic there.
---
Because he doesn't have logic. He's one of those hc pserver players that has probably played on all of them and leveled a million new characters but most people interested in classic are not like that. It always bogles my mind when these people say tbc etc were bad because you lost progress and they made your gear irrelevant, but at the same time preach starting over again and again losing everything you did.
---
Please tell us your credentials
---
2x this
---
lol I hate the damn things. &gt;&lt;
---
Also, that used to be one my go-to farming spots... for what I won't say.
---
A pvp server allows un-consensual ganking outside of the new player zones. A pve server requires you
---
To physically type /pvp and changes your status to be able to attack another player who also had to have typed /pvp aswell.
---
Once you pick a server you are locked in and have to spend $25 if you want to move your character to a different server.
---
 (You can have upto 50 characters on an account total across as many servers as you pick to play on)
---
1. Play what you want
---
2. Ret is subpar in a pve environment as far as we know, but theres a lot of theorycrafting going on so that might change once we can test the right items.
---
3. Corrupted Ashbringer is a PVP weapon, and one of the most fun pvp specs, especially when naxx is out for so long and everyone just does pvp, is Ret/Reck which is a 2 handed spec.
---
4. Mythic raiding is not vanilla raiding, its lkme comparing apples to oranges
---
That's why you have taunt if he really does take aggro. He either way didn't even hot him.
---
You mean wow?
---
Yeah, but the "streamers" wanting to attempt to be "1st" in classic isn't going to help because they aren't reporting bugs or anything.
---
Not sure how that‚Äôs true.   He‚Äôs leveled 1-60 on private servers, it doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to compare regen there to regen on the classic beta.
---
they are just showing their true colors
---
As in, is it a 10% max per spell cast? or does the % increase for each mob hit by aoe?
---
It's been forever but I want to say it's the first one. Maybe someone else can remember more clearly.
---
To life? Itself?
---
GMs confirmed you need active sub
---
The biggest issue was accessibility. 
---
You had to be attuned to get inside. So it made it difficult to recruit new players or bring alts. 
---
You had to have tier 2 or 2.5 gear to be of any use. Which requires you to have run previous raids to get that kind of gear. Unless you are lucky enough for the Naxx guild you're in to feed you gear from their Naxx runs.
---
As was mentioned already, one of the fights in the instance required eight well geared tanks to even attempt, which is basically unheard of. Most guilds did not have that many tanks, and had to steal tanks from other guilds. You also cannot skip this fight if you want to finish the instance and get to the last boss. 
---
Most of the player base never stepped foot inside Naxx. I wasn't joking when I said that only about 3% of the player base at the time actually entered the instance. 
---
That's not a good use of time and resources if you're a developer.
---
If you actually played OSRS you'd know most of the new content released in OSRS was actually back in rs2 and rs3. They are putting stuff back in while making sure to not repeat same mistakes, which is something they could do with TBC and so on.
---
Wow, I really appreciate the amount of thought you put into this. The intro vid makes a lot of sense and I am very thankful for it, as guides of this nature are slim, especially for alliance.
---
I was in vanilla open beta. Server firsts for all of vanilla. Quit pre tbc. Activated my account once or twice since then, only played cata with any seriousness. 
---
Reactivated and re subbed this morning. 
---
Original account is 200 fucking 4 bitches.
---
Just the minor things SIN, mailing address, birth certificate, drivers license, passport.
---
April 05 and no luck. But I only resubbed last night and have never been in a beta before (though I was invited to one once.) I only played a little BFA and Legion.
---
That setting is my best friend.
---
Thanks for this. Just rolled over and put him on
---
Will you Survive playing a video game ? Yeah sure
---
A few weapons aren't comparible to an entire expansion. Assuming you're talking about the recreation of Chaotics. Otherwise I have no idea what youre talking about.
---
Did you add time to the original account or just some other account? I have time on my late vanilla account but no time on my early vanilla account, unsure if it matters
---
Slim to none
---
I think most people watch him for the enthusiasm and effort. The youtube videos tend to drag out longer than they should, imo, but it's not generally unpleasant viewing. He's better watched for news rather than game knowledge.
---
The real people you should thank are the private server teams.
---
Blizzard was forced into doing this. It would never have happened without the likes of ... can't say the name because private servers are illegal!!
---
Huge lack of respect in general.
---
Hold up, theres another warcraft movie?
---
Just lie to me thx
---
Not true, people have gotten in with out an active subscription.
---
Everyone that has gotten in so far has seemingly been 2005 or earlier account.
---
My old man just passed could use a diversion like beta atm
---
Yaaas. We need people like YOU in there testing shit. I‚Äôm 05 baby crossing my fingers..
---
Very small. Seems like it just going out to those of us that actually played back then for right now.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what it seems like.. I‚Äôm wondering if any newer account have had access.
---
I'm begging downvoted for genuinely not knowing who someone is. Gg reddit
---
Which was pretty common iirc.
---
Seems common for content creators to be big for a few years and then drop off and for whatever reason lose a lot of traction. What do you do after that?
---
I am sure SOME have, but pretty damn rare. Rare on top of rare, you know?
---
Seems like blizz has been catering to older accounts, and streamers/content providers etc. So for us with slightly newer accounts, or straight up post 2010 accounts our wait might extend into the later phases/never category. Which you cant blame them, frankly youd want people to played vanilla to test your vanilla server.
---
Account created in 2005 EU here aswell. Seems like they're only inviting people who's been playing since 2004 which means they're all NA.
---
lmao, i love the vanilla wow gatekeepers
---
honestly, get a life. Nobody cares that much about if you played vanilla when it was relevant or not.
---
But did he use those on the pServer? He probably wouldn‚Äôt have compared the times if he was using addons on one of them
---
I'm playing this game wrong. I should reroll twitch streamer. Which server do I want?
---
Here you go: https://youtu.be/j01MfraN6b0
---
I can't think of a meaningful use for this. There might be a specific mob you could sneak by to solo another mob, but the edge case is so small and could be achieved by just using vanish anyway.
---
In stealth 1v1's you may get the opener, but that's another unimportant edge case unless you are really into duels.
---
It seems new accounts invited today are from 2004/2005 but chance is still small because there was like 1,5 million accounts or more.
---
jw do beta characters get deleted on launch?
---
BLESSED
---
First: tips never played the real vanilla.
---
Second: do not make memes about him, he will call the police ! 
---
;)
---
Since your account wasn‚Äôt created in 2004/2005. Highly unlikely right now.
---
There are far more people in beta than a handful of streamers, and there will be *far* more than that as time goes on. Blizzard extended invites to those streamers to build hype, which is clearly working. If they only report bugs on occasion, it's still fine, given how many others are also reporting.
---
I dont understand all the fuss over this. I loved BGs. Getting into them faster can only be a good thing in my mind.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I didn‚Äôt play in vanilla but I‚Äôm super excited to try it out. My glory days were in WOLK
---
It‚Äôs not the damage that‚Äôs the issue it‚Äôs the mana. Shadow priests are mana hogs and run out super fast you basically pop mana potions and dark runes every attempt on a boss  and still run Oom and wand for the last 25% of the boss.
---
And who would you be an Inconvenience to?
---
you can check your sub history on battlenet
---
no idea how to figure out cause my billing history page is blank. i‚Äôm either 2005 or 2006 tho uggghhh
---
you don't, but if there isn't a reason Bliz would want you, specifically, to be in it, you do. So if you're not a WOW/streaming name, yes
---
I think it shows more that you have to know how to play. Same shit happened to me the first time I had a priest and went oom because I was dpsing lol.
---
Afaik he had red chest piece, not shield block out on bars even
---
I can confirm I got in about 2 hours ago so.
---
I‚Äôm just glad we have a release date I‚Äôm grateful for that, but at the same time I‚Äôm itching just for an opportunity to play ya know?

* Play a character that looks cool.
---
* Read the quests, get involved in the local stories.
---
* Don't worry about keeping up with faster players. Let the cool looking gear motivate you to continue rather than to rush.
---
* Talk to people, help people, goof off with others.
---
* Don't worry about min-maxing until you reach high levels.
---
* Save your gold where you can - you'll need it for the mount at 40 (paladin &amp; warlock excluded).
---
WoW was originally designed to be a casual noob-friendly MMO. Be patient while playing and things will work out fine.
---
Mine goes back to only 2012 but I know my account is from Apr 2005.
---
Wrong. A lot of people want bc/wotlk
---
Age of account? Is the game time on your oldest account or a newer on?
---
I have an old vanilla account but my game time is on my more recent account, hope I am not screwed
---
No, that‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt raid on shadow priests, they are not viable just like ret Paladins or boomkins
---
Odd how the mana regen isn't in there. It's way to fast, no where near what it was in vanilla.
---
1. Dwarf is better for Alliance. Bar none.
---
2. You sustain through Demonic Runes, Potions, and later on, Wizard Oil (along with any MP5 you can get). Spirit+damage gear is... rare. You'll get a bit of regen, sure, but it's not enough that stacking Spirit is in any way a wise idea.
---
3. Any guild that's going to put up with an SPriest already knows they won't be topping damage meters. That's not their purpose. Their purpose is to provide a crucial debuff while also supplementing it with marginal DPS.
---
4. [This is the spec you want.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxxosVZZxGgz0tot) Or the same, but with 3 points in Imp MB instead of the Silence tech. But frankly, any points in Imp MB aren't worth much in a SPriest rotation. You mostly spam Mind Flay anyway with only an occasion MB between the Flays and SWPs if mana allows.
---
&gt; You say that, but there is something to be said about a game world that has areas off limits to everyone but the most hardcore players..
---
Wild Star did that and the game flopped. 
---
Again, from a business standpoint it makes no sense to create something that no one is going to use. You're better off relocating that resource to something else. 
---
&gt; We haven‚Äôt seen anything like that outside of the Heroic bosses since TBC.. I feel like it added a lot of awe to the world - seeing people in gear that most couldn‚Äôt obtain was a sight to behold.
---
No it wasn't. For most people the only reason they couldn't obtain that kind of gear was because they didn't want to spend the time starting from scratch and working their way up ***each tier*** of raids until they got caught up to current content.
---
I had a friend in TBC who joined a guild doing Black Temple. They were done with all the other raids, but he had just made a fresh level 70 character and didn't have much gear. 
---
They wouldn't carry him through Black Temple (since he would be a drain on them), so he paid them gold (for their repairs) to run him through the older raids so he could get geared out. 
---
It had almost nothing to do with how good someone was. It had everything to do with how much free time someone had back in those days. 
---
The current version of WoW is a much better indicator of who is good and who isn't simply by the types of encounters you can do. Being able to beat every boss on mythic for raids is an achievement.
---
Not the majority.
---
well that's really disheartening
---
The server I played on during Vanilla thru Wrath had a server wide raid charter PUG website with a point system that was consistent no matter which guild you raided with. It was called Leftovers.

Guilds or individuals could set up raid charters and others could sign up for then on a recurring or week to week basis to fill any empty roster spots.  Players would bid on every drop with their points they earned from killing bosses in a chartered raid and no preferential treatment was given to anyone.
---
It was perfect. You could raid each week if you wanted or just once a month. You could also swap over to a different charter one week if you needed a different raid time. You could even just sign up to be a backup. All boss/item transactions were reconciled and available publically on the website. It allowed you to creep on what gear players of a charter had received in the past to estimate how much competition you'd have for gear for a particular charter.
---
 None of those LFG websites like OpenRaid ever came close to what Leftovers achieved. I wish someone would bring it back.

---
I am asking this question everywhere as well. I really fucking hope we didnt screw ourselves as I am in the same boat
---
I mean it's not that crazy. People pay tons for different kinds of entertainment and you're basically helping to buy the executives new lambos. Is it that much different?
---
Sorry I‚Äôm saying if I get into the beta I‚Äôll make one and I‚Äôll be happy to post it, but I‚Äôll be playing rogue so that‚Äôs who it‚Äôd be used for.
---
The classes will be at their 1.12 versions from the beginning.
---
In beta, not a streamer. JUST got in like an hour ago though
---
If you have homies who are willing to do those things with you, sure. Unlikely to get an invite to a pug I would imagine unless you make your name known on the server as a great player or something
---
He's the only classic caster guy who really annoys me. I like Esfand and Stayfe, and love Frostadamus and Madseasonshow.
---
"wasting" it was 1 moonfire and tank went from 55-60%  to 0% 3 seconds after first hit with some amount of overkill, its very likely soda healing him wouldnt have saved him
---
Anyone can do 5-mans. You can also do casual raids, maybe. But no, Enhancement Shamans are not going to be invited to serious raid guilds. Rogues and Fury Warriors simply *strictly* outclass you, and unlike SPriests, you don't even provide enough utility to justify the marginal dps.
---
You're underselling them in PvP, though. Enh Shamans in PvP are absolutely hilarious with their burst, provided you can actually stick on a target.
---
You beautiful, beautiful man.
---
So does this show for everyone on any discord server? I‚Äôm not too familiar with discord aside from screaming innit on Sunday nights.
---
I'm pretty sure last time I played on a p server he wrecked our tank and we kited him down. Also due to our healer dpsing lol
---
How many developers does Jagex pay to make that happen? How many would Blizz need to pay split across the eventual 8 classic WoW expansions? Don't say you weren't warned.
---
Joana got in!
---
Lol I made a thread regarding this when this wasn't stickied and had a bunch of bowlcuts screeching at me saying "who fucking cares." Believe it or not the combat text from Vanilla creates a much more immersive experience than the BFA shit in the beta now.
---
mine only goes back to 2010 (3 pages of transactions) But I know for a fact I created it 5 years prior.  Is there another order history list somewhere?
---
Most people know how important it is to have a pee bottle, but it‚Äôs also crucial to have a cum bottle.
---
But why post it here. If people here are active in that sub they'll see it. If people here aren't active in that sub then they have no business in the discussion that only affects that sub.
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs vanilla wow and what we are fighting for our no changes. Somes specs just weren‚Äôt designed well in vanilla and you know what? That‚Äôs ok, ....but again I play a warrior, the only rank and best dps in the game lol.
---
You said above that people.on Classic OVERWHELMINGLY don't want TBC so why would that be a problem? They just won't move.
---
That's just how vanilla is man
---
Man that really sucks, was really wanting to play a shadow priest but I mostly pve so I guess I really shouldn't. Especially considering i'd never play a dwarf.
---
This is just wrong, poisons in vanilla aren't a chance to proc. Faster weapon = more applications
---
*crossroads*
---
and i almost related to you.
---
Actually feels really bad if I did screw myself. I wish the rules for invites weren't so ambiguous. Why couldn't they just say that they were giving priority to accounts made within the vanilla time bracket? :(
---
Wpvp is totally different at max level bfa than it is leveling in classic lmao don't even act like they are similar
---
Same. I'm complete shit at gambling so I'd just be subbing for no reason at all.
---
Well considering we will never move past Vani2it doesnt matter.
---
Either way Jagex is a LITERAL small indie dev company. 
---
Blizzard is Blizzard.
---
You have to turn on PvP? Like a pve server?
---
This reeks of confirmation bias, I know a few and have met in game several under 20 yos. Also whenever asmon streams WoW its on the first or second row of twitch so it still gets a lot of exposure to younger people
---
Both calling each other pussy‚Äôs, hunter keeps aspect of cheetah on.. this is the vanilla I remember :)
---
MaYbE WatcH tHE cLip nExT tiME
---
I know the beta is for bug testing but I think it's very interesting to see how much slower the speed levelers are in the beta compared to private servers. Having a few people speeding to max level is fine by me
---
Same thing here - I played Vanilla through WotlK, but my original account is long gone. I think I tried to recover several times but it wasn't possible. My current account never even subbed to WoW until now, all I have is the Blizzcon ticket from last year. Maybe that'll be enough in a later wave...
---
Why would Blizzard want to split the community to the point that realms cant even fill? Because thats what will happen if we have multiple xpacs going at once
---
I just got in too. Was at work for the past 9 hrs, so could have been anytime that period. Account created 2004. Played a bit every expansion, but unsubbed BFA about Nov last year. Resubbed when they announced beta. I am not content creator, but was on F&amp;F.
---
I'm really enjoying Themechanic's stream. Great humor there and dude's got some skills. He's doing this while hunting every rare spawn he can get. Really awesome stuff.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer
---
Mate, YES, you can do this. I have been doing it on p servers for the last year. It is 100% possible to level up casually and then raid casually just a few hours a week, and farm all the content except maybe C‚ÄôThun and Naxx. I‚Äôm actually doing Naxx now but it does require a little more time.
---
he hasn't actually been playing pservers for a long time. his level 60 that he has now is, as far as i know, this first level 60 in vanilla wow. he didn't play retail vanilla (which i wouldn't care about except when he was still a new content creator he lied and said he was a vanilla veteran) and i don't even think when he was doing recent things such as commentating the dueling tournament on the demo did he have a 60.
---
After he went like e he mentioned that he got the access 10 hours ago but had other stuff going on and even spent hour setting up his interface too.
---
I wouldn't expect him to make a speed run atm, he said he just wants to test the game his guide for now.
---
93k and rising
---
I have 4 vanilla accounts but only have gametime on the newest of them. I believe it was made in 2006. Nobody that has gotten in has listed anything past 2005 but I cant get any of them to answer the quest you have proposed here. UGH!!!!!!
---
Unless you know players in multiple layers that won't be a simple thing to do.
---
Players are put on one layer for the duration of the system. The layer you start on is your home layer and it will always put you there, with the below exceptions. Guilds members will be moved so the guild is on one layer. Otherwise you need an invite from someone on a different layer in order to get to it.
---
That's my understanding anyway, based on posts and interviews.
---
It will be difficult to exploit the system. Not impossible, though, of course.
---
BfA: Father! Is it over?
---
Blizzard: No king rules forever.
---
I, SIR, AM AGAINST THIS TRAVESTY OF A ‚ÄúFEATURE‚Äù!!!!
---
(No I‚Äôm not)
---
Did you read the very next sentence? Seems like ya didn't champ.
---
I agree with you. If you're in a group with friends messing around then do whatever. However isn't this guy an influencer for blizzard? I dunno if he is being paid or not but blizzard definitely wants him to stream the game to give it exposure. It feels a little irresponsible in his role of an influencer to troll/grief other players in front of potential customers or inexperienced players. Or worse, inspiring some of his impressionable fans to do the same
---
Asmon clicked his way through, sorry but he is average asf.
---
I dont even see a drop down for the regions on my wow battle net page. I only see the "install". Am i doing something wrong?
---
I mean, as many including myself have said, there's room for a few. I'm my guild's SPriest, and we're going pretty hardcore when the game releases. You just have to understand and accept that your position in the raid is a utilitarian one, and that if you're topping the DPS meters, then there's something *seriously* wrong with the other DPSers in the raid.
---
But yeah, for Alliance Dwarf is supreme because of Fear Ward. Human and even Nelf Priests can get spots, but being a non-Dwarf *and* trying to raid as Shadow is a tall fucking order, especially if you're not already intimately familiar with everything about it.
---
Personally, I was never a part of the no changes crowd though I definitely get where they are coming from. I'll admit I was hoping for a few small balance changes so that some specs that just got laughed at for people going into could at least be viable. Especially considering how awful balance was in vanilla.
---
But i know that's not a popular opinion. Honestly just glad we'll have talent trees and old work back to play in. Looking forward to farming stuff to put on the AH and grouping with people just to kill a elite mob in world randomly.
---
How can you check when your account was created? I'm not seeing it on the battle.net site and my purchase history only goes back to like 2010
---
That and holy shock is shorter range so you waste time running into range to pop it, when you could have just hit an FoL for the same time spent! Iirc the range on holy shock is only 20 yards?
---
I should've mentioned in main post, both the vanilla account and my main account are on the same battlenet email and can be selected from the drop down menu when logged in.
---
If that disappoints you then I'm afraid you are in for a rude awakening.....
---
Pog
---
that‚Äôs really what it sounds like. my account was created 2006 but i‚Äôm gonna hold out hope
---
I never understood why people get mad when others pot, it's part of the game.
---
Alexsensual got pissed when he lost to that 17hunter that potted when he was like 30 LOL.
---
if you pick a class that doesn‚Äôt have a trainer there, you‚Äôd have to go to under city every 2 levels
---
I meant opt in, not sign in but yeah. It's a gamble if you get invite or not.
---
If you don't have a second account, like for the ptr, you will not have a drop-down. If you get into beta it creates a beta account for you, which should give you a drop-down when you relaunch bnet
---
They should just put a sub category under the wow section so you can choose to filter between classic and BFA.
---
HoTing on Verdent will quickly end up with a miss by the tank on the first swing, rooted and left in the dust as the boss heads toward the healer.
---
Yes.
---
Yes. If you would have asked that a year ago I'd have said no. But the way theyve handled Classic - yes i trust them.
---
Oh right, maybe not so good for shaman. Thanks!

GAMERS RISE UP
---
I think a new wave of beta access went out tonight, as I got into the beta as well, and a bunch of people running around Elwynn said the option also just popped up in their launcher tonight.
---
Skorch didn't stream any of his run, so who knows.
---
Ah, totally forgot about that racial! Thanks for the reminder.
---
Why alliance in general? And especially why a Gnome?
---
Oh dang, you're in a way better spot than I am then. Fingers crossed for you!
---
so basically something to easily gatekeep players? doesnt really have a place in vanilla. if you wanna find out if someone has good manners or is easy to get along with just talk with them before you invite them
---
And theres plenty of tanks who handled him fine. SonyDigital did it. The healer had to basically spam, but yeah.
---
Easier or harder than you remember?
---
Seems like 99% of the invites are for Americans right now.
---
Whats the point of taking the same path after classic!?
---
Do alternative path that is closer to vanilla experience... we already have the other path that leads to BFA!
---
It will be so cool if we get completely new zones and stuff that that holds everything that we wanted classic so much for, just different.
---
elemental/resto
---
I don't remember the exact talents but you should be able to find it. It was a fairly popular spec for doing various types of content.
---
How much aoe leveling did you do compared to questing?
---
What spec did you level with and did you do a respec at all when you unlocked blizzard if you did aoe level?
---
Gnome is the best Mage race. Dat Intellect bonus, yo. Mages get almost double the effect of Int compared to any other class.
---
Lmao, blocked cleaning the shit out of wheel mice from my memory.
---
Maybe? I don't know. I'm not subbed on the vanilla account, I'm only subbed on the main account. :(
---
Started in June 05, didn't get invite. :(

The videos you linked arnt nearly half of what was in that twitch clip

Stupid report, makes me wonder how many more of these he writes that are just false....
---
What are your talents and did anything change from private servers to beta?
---
I find it interesting that very few people are playing Priest and Warlock on the Beta.
---
Thoughts?
---
Wow, rogues represent I guess?

Reddit can sometimes house some of the most idiotic comments ever known to man.

He‚Äòll learn until he gets to Naxx. Like all people do who say, what comes after Naxx. Get there in the first place.

In a way, speed leveling is a test all of it's own.

I get the vibe a new wave of beta invites went out tonight, as the beta option popped up in my launcher tonight as well, and a bunch of people running around Elwynn said the option also just appeared in their launcher tonight.
---
Yeah absolutely not, keep this obnoxious gatekeeping cancerous mentality where it belongs, shitty retail.
---
Because they don't want to acknowledge that blizzard has taken the game in a bad direction
---
This is not china, no fucking behaviour-rating addons please.
---
yea I already know all about it. Classic is really a MIXED bag for me. it has a lot of things I'm really excited about and a lot of things that i'm REALLY not excited about.
---
Actual class fantasy and cool class quests and Earning real rewards through effort and time? Awesome love it!
---
balance/tons of specs being absolutely dead in the water and will forever remain dead due to the "no change crowd"? Considerably less excited...
---
Not really, you just highly over-estimate the impact you have on the playerbase as a ganker. You can spend three hours making one persons time insufferable, but that's one person in a group of thousands.
---
For most people gankers is a five minute inconvenience they forget about in hour.
---
We all know what happens when you turn WoW into a game of numbers.. from a business standpoint you are correct but what you are forgetting is it heavily detracts from the game world and feel IMO.
---
Modern WoW is exactly what comes when too many ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù people get to control the game. Its stupid AF
---
Yes, there will be one there if you get in
---
We will mourn for you
---
This. Looked for 5 min, couldn't find one guy upset with the 100k viewers of Asmongold...
---
Correct.
---
ty!
---
This is because you don‚Äôt have multiple wow accounts. If you get beta it counts as a second account and will show up.
---
No, lol
---
Enjoy the hype
---
Thanks for the heads up! Was able to get one for my friend and I!!
---
Fyi, Joana is in now and is streaming. 
---
awesome.
---
I remember the first time I went to redridge, I was walking towards the inn and had just taken a left on the bridge. I see an orc on the roof casting something and lighting shot out from his hands killing bouncing off a guard and killing two alliance in front of me. I was like HOLY SH*T! This shaman and hunter sat on the roof ganking everyone who walked by for almost the entire afternoon. This made me fall in love with the game. I had no idea horde would be in a low level zone like that and had a sense of wonderment of how they managed to even get to Redridge. I quit my paladin a few weeks later at 41 and it inspired me to make a Horde hunter. I made the ugliest orc hunter possible in hopes of ganking people on the Redridge roof.
---
Ehhh forever is a strong word.
---
 I strongly suspect Classic will split sometime down the road into "time locked" servers (servers that never go beyond Naxx) and "Revision" servers (where the game is still
---
Still level capped at 60, but they do new content/balancing based on community input)
---
Missed the jump in WC twice. He then said he actually missed the first jump on accident but the SECOND jump he fucked it up on purpose. Then later when he was lost and running around and pulling elites without noticing it, he had to go for the jump again. He used a speed increase consumable to make the jump easier this time around. I literally laughed my dick off seeing how nervous he was to have to pop a speed pot or whatever it was. Fucking comedy. 
---
The dude is just horrible at the game. He is actually bad. I do realize everyone had been playing for a long ass time. Soda was pretty bad at healing and kept wasting mana for damage... but Soda was clearly just struggling heavily from the fatigue of staying up so late. He was annoyed and tired. Tips was literally just visibly bad at the game. 
---
He turned off his mic and claimed that he couldn‚Äôt speak because his voice was gone. He was losing his voice but when he muted his mic you could see him laughing and talking to himself really loud. That dude was and should have been embarrassed. Overall that run was some comedy ass barrens chat formed WC. Definitely a testament to how horrible all the plebs are going to be.
---
You got invited an hour ago or just started playing an hour ago?
---
Take this idea and go pound sand
---
Np, hope you get in.
---
Yes...it's absolutely laughable.  In a sad way though.  A bunch of bored shut-ins paying to watch some guy do the exact same thing they're going to do for themselves 4 months from now.  What a stupid way to waste money.
---
I‚Äôm in the same exact boat
---
NP. That drop down list shows when you have two or more wow accounts, including betas or ptr. Thus, the second you get the beta you will have two accounts which forces the drop down list to appear
---
The thing is I would not trust 2019 blizzard to balance vanilla wow. And when you change one thing people beg for more changes then we have LFG and mounts in the game. Just keep it un touched and let us play vanilla. 
---
I understand colorblind mode, and I get why they added the QoL  auto loot. Vanilla had auto loot but you had to hold shift when looting.  I‚Äôd rather they be 100% faithful but I would be lieing if I said I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy the fuck out of it‚Äù
---
Soo close...yet so far away
---
If anyone wants anything tested let me know and I'll try. I just was surprised this was in the beta because this is normally not implemented on new realms during Vanilla's life and with "Layering" being implemented that means there would be multiple gurubashi arenas per realm for people to farm with potentially.
---
Did it live up to your expectations? Has the beta fallen flat for you in any way? Any concerns for launch come August?
---
What professions did you run or will you be running?
---
Did you follow a route that is public or go off of one that you know?
---
You into account sharing? /s
---
I really not sure if that will happen. The "no changes" crowd is pretty numerous and loud. Hell even if I don't personally agree with them due to wanting better balance I definitely respect their desire for an authentic vanilla experience.
---
Who the fuck us this guy. He's popping up on my YT suggestion feed but his videos are rather annoying.
---
Lots of things are actually more digits than displayed, and truncated.  From what I saw, the warrior would have 10 rage, but I believe the way it works is that 'Add Rage' has a default of 1, and it adds 9 to that one with the 'Modifier'.  
---
When you look at the wow files for 1.13, they seem to be broken: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=100/charge  
---
You can see there that the 89 turns into 90, which then adds 9 rage.  This is probably a conversion error from the 'faster' engery/rage 'ticks' in retail.
---
If this is anything like vanilla you will no who the toxic players are on your server.
---
Good! Nice going!
---
Hard hitting boss, wasting globals on moonfire and wrath, no precast, it was equally his fault lol
---
like apex right
---
Not at all, I don't know much about rouges but they're able to do a lot more dps without worrying about stealing aggro from the boss.
---
As far as Rouge vs Warrior Dps goes by raw numbers it changes from phase to phase and skill. But neither really overshadows the other by much for long.
---
Warriors can produce more damage but I would say that an average guild will see rogues and warriors being fairly close. Rogues can feint to drop some threat and vanish to drop all threat. THey can play catchup in this manner. However, if you are in an uber elite raiding guild, the tanks will be pumping out so much threat that the warriors get to go more ham and thus will edge out the rogues. I could be wrong but I am fairly certain this information is correct, take it for what you will
---
AFAIK all phases are active in Beta. AQ is open. I think this was even mentioned during one of the interviews at the Warcraft summit when some of the Devs were asked about Thorium Point/Hinterlands/Silithus quests.
---
They have completely different roles in PVP.  
---
In PVE, warriors do more damage and generally have more utility as they can off tank.
---
Some people do fight for "sport" and they wait for a relatively "fair fight. When I was younger, I wanted the fight to be as one-sided as possible, but now that I'm 15 years older, I understand the whole "honorable" wpvp angle much more.
---
Yeah, this has been pretty unpleasant.
---
Loool
---
Ohh really? I'll run down there on a lvl 1 and check if gates are open.
---
Not really, he was just bad.
---
It's always satisfying to turn the tables on your aggressor that fast too...Sad he died but pots happen...so use yours too!
---
you're like 15 years late bro.
---
Sure, but why play Rogue when Warrior does the job, but is also more useful in PvP AND can swap gear and tank 5-mans?
---
There's an amazing point during that stream where Asmon is thanking everyone for the incredible outpouring of support, it's heartfelt and a little winded but Asmongold is understandably excited. The chat is emoting hearts and teary eyes and it's a feelsgoodmoment. There's a perfect comedic moment of silence and McConnel pipes up.
---
"You done sucking chat's dick now??"
---
Gave me the mind of laugh you can't stay sitting for, McConnel is hilarious
---
The thing where he called the cops on someone because of a YouTube comment?

Give the guy a break, who the fuck gives a shit if he's shit at the game or not?
---
I think there's a lot of content creators that will experience a big sub drop once classic releases. I mean, even I'm subbed to a lot of content creators just because I'm so starved for classic content...
---
Ya and something good to think about is once layers are gone. Chances are that the toxic streamers will be on to their next game.
---
Well yeah, but Blood Elves are still biologically High Elves, just with a Sunwell magic craving‚Äìformerly. Void Elves are still essentially High Elves, but not really.
---
I wish they had gone all the way there, but nah. No playable High Elves, and I doubt there ever will be.
---
ummm i believe you mean a crocolisk was eating your rogue
---
ya my friend got one and he didn't even start WoW till Lich King ... like wtf, he wouldn't know if something was bugged or not.
---
alright this circlejerk is getting near /r/gaming levels... chill boys
---
What kind of bugs did you find?
---
O I get where they're coming from, but the point of having a split is to appease both the #nochanges mob and the people who actually want to play a real and active MMORPG again, not just an old (and eventually stagnant) MMORPG over and over again, something that Modern WoW can never really go back to.
---
WoW: Vanilla was not perfect. It was (and will continue to be) a fantastic game and probably one of the best ever made. But it's still not perfect.
---
nope, but now that people have access to the beta and can examine the api, there's a good chance you'll have updated addons or new addons with similar functionality by launch day.
---
How would one get access to the beta?
---
I seriously understand that fear and agree that if they can't balance classes while keeping with the spirit of vanilla then they shouldn't.
---
I just wish we lived in the perfect world where the could balance stuff and make at least most of the specs semi-viable while maintaining the spirit and rotations of the specs in question. (like i hope they'd maintain the hybrid tax and other stuff like that so that classes that have more utility do less damage then the pures but it'd still be worth brining a few if they're good players.)
---
Wow. What a fucking kook.
---
grats man!
---
What did you think of the weather effects?
---
Have a bnet account, ticked participate beta boxes.
---
If you had been playing on any 'undocumented servers' prior to the beta, what comes to mind as different/unexpected?
---
Yoink
---
Who even likes this guy? EVERYthing about him is obnoxious. And then there's these dozens of YouTube channels I've had to block with video blocker who just post his clips with their own commentary... Streamers streaming streamers... What's next?
---
Rogues start fights warriors finish them. Not a clever phrase or anything it actually works that way. Rogue damage is frontloaded to openers from stealth and warriors dish out executes to low health targets end loading their damage. Similarly energy for a rogue you start with alot and work down and rage for warriors you start with a little and build up, their damage is proportional to this and follows the same trend. If you want to pester people rogue is better. If you're looking to kill lowbies both do it very effectively. If you're looking to kill people your level then some do better than others but generally warriors win out in my experience. Rogues have their place but for me personally it felt like playing a shitty warrior with less gear choices.
---
Wait, what? Proof of any of this?

THINKING TUMBLR EMOJICON 100% W OMEGALUL W
---
That‚Äôs not really how the legal system works. Blizzard can do what ever they want with their product.
---
Serious question because I know close to nothing about Twitch, is 100k an unusual amount?
---
Technically classic is retail as you need to pay a sub to play
---
you need active sub to play the beta, though.
---
Lol
---
How did you manage to do that ? It‚Äôs about an hour a level. Did you use any sort of guides/addons?
---
In Vanilla some specs were just meant for PvE and some were PvP.
---
Sadly enough Shadow isn't a viable PvE class but it's a t1 PvP spec. It's in the same boat as Elemental, Arms, Assassination, Feral and many many more specs. 
---
Of course some of these specs are stronger than others in PvP/PvE but they all aren't the optimal choice for PvE. I'm personally fine with certain talents being for PvP. PvP is a huge part of the game.
---
People might bring a SP to buff Locks but it's by no way a viable top dps or optimal spec for that class. ;( Rolling a Warlock/Mage would probably be better if you want to caster DPS in raids.
---
Right I‚Äôm 26 I first played 1 year before BC came out. I only made it to level 40 in vanilla wow. Mostly because this was my first actual computer game and didn‚Äôt really know wtf I was doing. I only found thotbot like 3 months before BC.

Yup. My brother graduated at 28 and is still trying to figure life out, my other two good friends around ~25. I got out at 22 but I'm not even pursuing a career in my degree's field. I went to college with numerous people in their late 20s and 30s.
---
This is a good point, and I thought about addressing this in my original comment here.
---
First off, supporting offspecs do help, but not enough, in raw numbers, to offset a full dps, generally. Things like Battle Rez are hard to quantify, of course. This is not my issue with bringing them.
---
I know there are players that just want to see the content, enjoy a raid night, a guild community, and not care about loot. I am a fairly loot-minded player, I will admit, and I can't help but seeing this as some kind of voluntary self-exploitation. Because I know many raids handle this differently, and they'd be better off, in my view, joining those.
---
I'd actually rather bring along a Boomkin and treat them as a 'full member' than establishing a two-class system. Sorry.
---
Again, I don't want to dissuade you from playing an offspec. Many, many raids will handle this differently, this is just my personal stance.
---
Stealth
---
I also need this info
---
That's true, if tanking and pre-made bgs are something you're interested in definitely go War, though rouges still have their niche. For instance Rouges can stealth farm Dire Maul tribute chests for gold. 
---
Also If I remember right fresh 60 and low geared rouges do much better damage than warriors starting out.
---
god I hope this post isn‚Äôt serious lol
---
Some of the streamers have been given beta access even though they don‚Äôt have an active sub. However that‚Äôs to be expected as they want the exposure.
---
 You can see Tipsout he gave to many people who weren't subscribed to WOW beta access
---
I honestly hope to be this person. As soon as I hit 60 I am going to make leveling fucking hell for people. Why? Because it happened to me in 2004 so its going to happen to someone else.
---
I know a lot of people have tried to draw the conclusion that when your account was created correlates to if you will be given beta access
---
I have 2 OG accounts and haven't gotten invited on either, neither have active subs but still.
---
I think it's pretty random as long as you've opted in for the beta
---
This should help explain things:

---
Holy shit! Can you elaborate? lmao
---
Height of classic wow vs just another day in retail. It'l die down a bit a couple months after release I imagine. Im as excited as classic as much as the next guy, but these comparisons are biased/unreasonable imo.
---
I have asked and posted in several threads, nobody seems to be answering and I have this growing feeling in my gut that says I am fucked, LOL
---
Yep, on private servers it is working as the first as well. However the talent wording makes it sounds like it should be the later.
---
Only issue i have with warlock/mage is that I like having the option to respec into a healer if the guild really needs me too. 
---
Though i guess i'll just have to go lock to get my spooky boy fix even though I here there rotation is very difficult
---
Cries in europe. I started 10 days after EU release. Hope to get in in one of the next waves.
---
&gt; We all know what happens when you turn WoW into a game of numbers.. from a business standpoint you are correct but what you are forgetting is it heavily detracts from the game world and feel IMO.
---
I've seen this sentiment before and it is extremely interesting to see people talk about it. You talk about a nigh unreachable goal for a majority of players as a fun and interesting thing. 
---
Not because you can't do it because you're not good, but because of other factors outside of your control. 
---
Players didn't play Naxx because it was too hard. There were mechanics that prevented people from getting to that instance that time-gated them out. 
---
Naxx wasn't hard. 
---
Getting the Undying title in Wrath was difficult. 
---
Killing Kil'Jaden on mythic is difficult. 
---
You're talking about barriers of entry that have nothing to do with how good the player is but suggesting it's a good thing? 
---
&gt; Modern WoW is exactly what comes when too many ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù people get to control the game. Its stupid AF
---
This is ultra vague and has almost no meaning without examples. Doing the raids on mythic difficulty in Legion were actually hard and real accomplishments. It had nothing to do with poaching tanks so you'd have enough, or being able to do new content only because you did the previous two raids. 
---
It was about how good you were at your class and how good you were in general, not how many hours you clocked in.
---
Tbh you‚Äôre completely correct OP. Rogues are slightly easier levelers but only cuz they can actually run from bad pulls
---
Sad, but true. I also started changing the font size in every game a few years ago.
---
Hurray!
---
Some of y‚Äôall might have Played in vanilla Wow but most of y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt actually PLAYED Vanilla WOW.
---
Tips can not just give beta to anyone. You need more proof.
---
Please, no.. let the meme die.. I beg you
---
The thing is if you have 39 people and the last spot is a shadow priest, and you don‚Äôt kill the boss it‚Äôs not because you brought a shadow priest instead of a mage.
---
If you want to play a ‚Äúmeme spec‚Äù because that what you play in retail then go for it man. Play the way you want to enjoy wow. But remember if you play a meme spec people will think you are intentionally trying to waist everyone‚Äôs time. Also you will need to try hard for full buffs and flasks and food and mana pots and dark runes and be the absolute best that you can be to tie with a mediocre mage that‚Äôs not trying very hard.
---
Because you want to play a rogue? I mean if everyone had your attitude no one would ever roll a druid. Some people just like a different playstyle and don't mind being less powerful.
---
I got in tonight too. Been playing since Jan 05. Active sub but hasn‚Äôt always been active . Played at least the majority of every expansion.  I‚Äôm not a content creator or streamer.
---
Im a healer frost mage can I come?
---
Exactly dude. I'm 23; I know people my age with spouses and kids, I know others still fucking around and partying in college. It's weird. The way I see it is just keep your foot on the gas and you'll get where you need to be eventually.
---
I am willing to bet that Blizzard gave them some free game time as I suspect its a requirement to even log into the beta.
---
Maybe they are still in school BECAUSE they played in 2004!
---
it should be required to wear a shock collar when you say something stupid so anyone who sees it can give you a bit of a zap because it needs to hurt to say stupid shit just as much as it does for us to read it
---
he is sarkastik with 90% of what he says
---
Unfortunately it's just a limitation of the spec. Spirit is really underwhelming even with the 15% regen while casting talent. Since mana regens in 2 second ticks it takes a huge amount of spirit per noticeable point of difference. May be slightly different in classic, but on private servers it took 46 points of spirit per 1 point of increase in Mana regen per tick while casting with the 15% talent. (Which equates to 7 spirit per point of increase while not casting).
---
That means if you stacked an extra 120 spirit on your gear over another spriest you'd only be getting 2 more mana per tick while casting (that's 5 mp5) everything else being equal.
---
Pure Mp5 and spell damage are shadow priests best friends.
---
You won't be a top DPS as a shadow priest, but you can get by and you do provide a utility to the raid. Be aware that Mana consumables will be tougher for you than any other caster class (minus oomkins which really aren't a thing lol) The spot will be in demand and competitive and if a raid has an established spriest good luck getting in, but it's doable.
---
I played the beta in 2004.  Nobody called it VC in the beta.  American or eu. (I played on both because american beta was first).
---
Some people renamed it when Dire Maul came out.  Dire Maul wasn't there on launch.
---
Unlikely, you can play PTRs with with gametime.
---
haha. I love this.
---
Beta is height of classic wow? lol
---
OSRS dropped and was 50k players first year, ~10k in 2013 and 2019 has ~100k players 
---
The "height" of retail was BC and it won't surpass that with the route they're taking
---
1 downvote = 1 shock.

fuck blizz and fuck tipsout
---
Double the effect? lolz
---
You are a genius
---
I'm planting some grass in a litter box tomorrow, genuine thanks for giving me the idea
---
Remind me to join your guild when it launches
---
Basically the same for me. I got in  several hours ago
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
My only problem with this situation is that these kinds of scrubs have the voice and influence to (maybe) make Blizzard change things. Reporting mechanic as a ‚Äúbug‚Äù because they suck is not good.
---
Classic wow will share a subscription with Retail wow. My suspicion is that they are requiring the subscription so they can test to make sure that they are sharing the sub properly.
---
Pls be a troll
---
Druid has a good niche as the best flag carried and all-arounder. Rogue is directly competing with fury warrior... and losing in most cases.
---
For one person, it's pretty big, especially for games that aren't Fortnite/League/etc.
---
If he elaborates, tips will call the popo. Better not
---
Again I doubt it does. As normally betas don‚Äôt require a subscription.
---
I have an impression that EU invites are on hold still. At least I saw many happy US and Canada players, but still no EU, except for a few streamers. I might be wrong, though.
---
Damn. Been a while since I've watched asmon lol. What happened? Dude used to be a 1-2k viewer kinda guy lol
---
^^
---
People on this reddit think we are too hard on the streamers.  Truth is they got guaranteed beta passes to help debug a game some of them never played or played little of.  It is terribly annoying to see people like tipsout interview blizzard employees and say uneducated things like, ‚Äúhow many physical servers will you set up?‚Äù (Obviously that doesn‚Äôt matter there will be many virtual machines on each physical server), and he said his excitement was like doing, ‚Äúshots of cocaine.‚Äù  He also uses words in the wrong context every single stream, mostly the word ‚Äútertiary.‚Äù 
---
He looks and acts like a meathead, and he is a liar.  
---
This is who represents the community of vanilla wow players....that truly sucks
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425341147](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425341147)   
---
here u go
---
rogues are more fun to play and they can go invisible
---
well this isnt really a normal beta, its not an expansion to the current game theyre adding a two for one sort of feature and they might be trying to test if the system for that works properly
---
I find it more infuriating that people that resubbed literally the day release was announced are being chosen over someone like me that has been subbed to wow since Classic. I want classic as well.
---
I mean we can't currently say but if this game takes off:
---
A: I want a fucking apology on Blizzard for ruining a game I loved
---
B: I want them to develop for WoW classic, make new content and diverge from the route.
---
Seriously, I am so bitter.
---
WC boss is basically like lowbie Patchwerk. Just gotta power spam heals and save mana pots. He hits way too hard to try and cancel cast or dps.
---
Sees me in a contested zone? Say goodbye. Or one of us say goodbye, because I would run away if you're stronger. Ah Classic WoW
---
Look at all these knowlesgeable backseat gamers.
---
Honestly, take a look in the mirror and examine your behaviors. Doesn't matter to me what streamer did what and how, I'd rather not be on the same server as all of you if this is the average maturity of Classic players. 
---
Do you really think that being toxic is justified when you are aiming it at someone you think is toxic?
---
Are you even listening to what I am saying, lol. Lets agree to disagree
---
They are supposed to represent us.  So yes, we are hard on them when they treat the opportunity to test the game we are waiting for like shit.
---
^ this is my present daughter
---
Why is it like everyone just forgot that grass grows so fast, we have to mow it constantly to keep it from going to seed...
---
Any chance in the world you played on a MUD called EotL?
---
Holy macarena, that was fats, well done!
---
Going to be so juicy, can't wait!
---
Well there's plenty of situations where rogue is better than warrior if you want to think like that. It is far better at killing mages and locking down healers. It is much better in any threat capped fight. It has far better CC in dungeons/pvp/questing. It's much better solo open world pvp.
---
Ya the rain storm in Elwyn the last few hours was fairly intense. And earlier today I saw what looked like a tropical storm in wetlands on a stream. The weather effects are seriously impressive
---
Well, I was in public school at the time, and now I'm finishing my masters at the university. So it fits!
---
this is a high iq thread
---
Can you say that again? After watching the video I need everything repeated 5 times before I can understand.
---
At least he doesn't run ads during his streams. He could be making even more money if he was all about the greed.
---
Theres 2 different purchase histories. Just google it theres links posted on reddit. You don't see the account creation day, but mine goes all the way to the free month claim in 2005.
---
Half my family are general contractors and the other half went to college and have professional careers, so I can see both sides. 
---
Having a degree is its own leg up. It shows commitment and at the very least some level of intelligence and experience. Just because you don't work in a museum with your history degree doesn't mean it's worthless. 
---
My dad refused to let me work construction with him because he knows how difficult the trades are. He wanted me to get a desk job.
---
probably because "bad direction" is a relatively subjective term and a lot of them feel it's fine. Or just started after they made a lot of the changes and have no personal experience to compare it to.
---
There are report of some people in the most recent wave got in with out a sub. Time will tell if it‚Äôs true or not.
---
It was and will be.
---
The only thing that doesn't work is changing it after the boss dies (which does sort of work on Private servers).
---
That's why it's important to blacklist people who don't state the rules upfront or actively break the stated group rules.
---
Man I watched alexsensual a video on him talking about how much of a bitch tips was and he deleted it within 20 min of making and posting it. And then saw a video of how that meme offended him and how he called the cops. Lol 
---
Tips is and will always be a bitch in my eyes. I personally like alexsensual because he says what he wants and isn‚Äôt so politically correct. It‚Äôs refreshing and you can tell he absolutely loves this game. Esfand and stay safe and Madseason are dope also.
---
I remember at one point during his stream, tips was saying some shit about how he was one of the best vanilla warriors. I almost fell out of my chair from laughing so hard.
---
Whats the plan now? Level another character?
---
Miyjii's post addresses this in great detail, but basically, DPK makes this worse, since now you have to explain the the Boomkin why he's not getting Neltharion's Tear despite having the most DKP. 
---
Because he's not getting it. People might rightfully leave the guild over this if he does, because it's proof the loot system is not working.
---
Ya, well see
---
How interesting is your rotation while levelling? Are the spells engaging?
---
Do you think Classic levelling will be appealing to most people or do you think it'll turn them off from the game?
---
Can someonr link me the vod where Tip does this?
---
First Trailer Park Boys reference on the subreddit? Nice!
---
from what ive heard you dont need an active sub to be chosen for the beta, but to log into the beta and play you do need an active sub
---
Of course content creators get access, it helps blizzard promote classic WoW
---
Good points
---
Rogue4lyfe
---
Interesting. I could see that being plausible.
---
I dont get the hype... just play on a pserver or join in on the stress test later? In three months we all will be playing.
---
Idk, I think it is kind of fun seeing people new to vanilla experience this stuff.
---
Everyone who groups with randoms will end up grouping with bad tanks like this on occasion.
---
This is my favorite post on this sub so far.
---
You're not accounting for so many factors. These will be busy servers with quest competition, ganking, etc. On top of that, most classes simply can't do 6.5 days played easily. The guides used for hunters won't apply at all to warriors, too many quests they can't do efficiently at the same levels.
---
I leveled around 12 characters on Vanilla when it was live. My quickest hunters were 5 days X hours. I feel 10 days played will be "quick" for most people during Classic. I'm aiming for 10-12 days on a warrior.
---
&gt; very likely soda healing him wouldnt have saved him
---
Nah, they just have no idea how to kill that boss. You pull him with a bow and the healer starts pre-casting so he heals you before the second hit. 
---
They had two other warriors in the group who didn't have shields to equip who are also at fault.
---
Tips is just way newer and inexperienced at vanilla than he lets on.
---
That is how it was done. Weather rendering was never done server side. Which is why there was a weather intensity slider.
---
Rendering a graphical element serverside doesn't make sense, since the client will have to render it anyway.
---
if
---
Who is he?
---
And this is why I never want to be on a server with the fucker
---
I know defending streamers of any kind is kind of a sour spot on this sub, but I'm actually happy Asmongold got that kind of attention. He puts a fair amount of money into helping his family's living conditions, health, and well-being.
---
.. Compared to other more "mainstream" streamers which just piss away money on crippling gambling addictions, stupid spending for content, or stupid spending for the purpose of flexing.
---
well the hype is that it ISNT a private server, and that its actual vanilla reproduced by blizzard.
---
You could always just do what I play on doing and level as Shadow, Respec Holy at 60, heal raids and respec when you want to do some BGs and other activities. It will be a bit costly but works if you play a lot.
---
If you like being able to bring more support on demand I'd probably roll a Mage though. (If you can stand the aesthetic) 
---
Consumables, portals, slows, fantastic CC and great cleave + single target. Of course it's not the same as being a healer but you're basically a mini support with all that utility and QoL.
---
Not to say that Summons and Healthstones aren't great, but Mage has a little bit more usefulness in a dungeon group.
---
You can't go wrong with either caster option. Tanks will love having you in a group regardless!
---
I loved that webpage. And the individual pvp page. Seeing your name on the top during the pvp grind was awesome
---
This is the link to check, it was super hard to find. The history on my account only goes back to 2012 on the main blizzard history page, this one goes back to 2005. Works for NA.
---
https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html
---
Still trying to work out how he got a following in the first place. The name of his channel is literally asking you for money and it‚Äôs based off a phrase used by horny 15 year olds trying to be funny
---
I'm sure they won't just look at one report and take it at face value and start changing stuff. They have the 1.12 client at their office, they'll probably just double check to see if the numbers are correct and match the real client. I mean sure he shouldn't report this shit considering he has absolutely no fucking idea about it, but he's just some dude that loves Classic. I mean if the likes of TradeChat and Towelliee got beta invites as well I'm sure they'll get a bunch of fucked reports anyway.
---
&gt; This so much, even having gear that was ridiculously hard to obtain made it all the more special when you got to show it off in-game..
---
Vanilla wasn't hard though. The only difficulty with Vanilla was the time you had to put in to actually get those items. But the fights were objectively not difficult to do. 
---
About 892 guilds defeated Mythic Kil'Jaden in Legion. 
---
There were about 30,000 guilds doing Tomb of Sargeras at this time. 
---
That means 3% of those guilds were able to beat that boss. Not because of time-gating. Not because of having to steal tanks. Not because they didn't have gear. 
---
It was legitimately difficult. 
---
I will be really curious to see how people take to raiding. With all the resources, addons, and knowledge out there now, the only difficulties I think we will see is one of time commitment rather than actual mechanic problems. 
---
"I don't have enough time" is not a good mechanic, IMO.
---
A fool and their money
---
confirmed troll
---
I hate that toothy, doll-eyed fucking child.
---
Prob because he knows where everything‚Äôs at and his computer is 100x better.
---
Nice! Thank you. 4/11/2005 here
---
For me it's the opposite. I'm fine with updated graphics but HATE the new models. Especially how they move. That's the main reason I can't stomach retail. Doesn't feel like WoW to me.
---
Because this isn't a new expansion, where you need to blank invites across the spectrum to get a wide range of player types and experiences to give feedback on new design.
---
This is a time capsule game, you need only 1 type of player, the one who played it and knows how it should be functioning and when it isn't functioning. You need a classic player to ensure you get feedback and bug reports when the game isn't working like classic. Anyone else just shits up the feedback and reports with ignorance or lack of understanding of classic. You can already see this with several streamers reporting quests as broken when they have intentional long respawn times, reporting bosses for being broken because they hit really hard, etc.
---
5% intellect increase.
---
Boots increase stealth level by 1, so by character level that would be 65.2. Not sure if it only makes affects stealth every 5 stealth levels or not. Either way it forces you to wear low level boots, so it's not worth using.
---
Perception only matters if you're playing on Horde. It is 10 levels worth of detection, essentially making your stealth as if you were level 50 around them. Even if you have all the stealth buffs you're still a level 55 to them. With the sheer popularity of humans on Alliance, how effective it is, 20 second duration and 3 minute cooldown, I consider it to be a fairly big deal.
---
We talking about the same guy? Lol sure
---
Don't forget that when the Blizz devs in that interview said "it's all up to community feedback [to get TBC/Wrath/Post-Naxx Classic]" they gestured and nodded towards him with a "so be sure to let us know" type comment. Directly to Tipsout.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvmvPE3toOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvmvPE3toOw)

You can see it all on this video, so much lmao on that video.
---
Idk what is worse if that pleb or the friend of him who got into the beta too and reported 0 bugs because he is speedrunning, literally most of the chat telling him to report the bugs, "we are blasting boyz, no time to report bugs"
---
You'll still certainly remember it better than the guy that started in WoD
---
Really good words dude :)
---
None of that crap :)

Instagram models have better comedy?

Love your druid PvP movies man. What class will you play in Classic? Are you going to make more movies? Peace
---
What differences have you noticed between vanilla and classic?
---
Neat
---
Did he actually report this bug? If so that's fucking ridiculous, I watched them kill Verdan and it seems accurate...
---
They downvote you because its true
---
Class and race I understand, but faction? That‚Äôs set in stone.
---
No it wasn‚Äôt
---
You should try out Classic nonetheless. With new shaders and shadows/foliage it already looks way better than 1.12 WoW.
---
 and this too, I don't play beta, but I watch the streams and watch them.
---
I want to thank all the beta testers for testing the game, for a smooth and bugfree release, so I don't have to do it.
---
A lot of people who played for years only on vanilla servers think they are vanilla veterans. Because they played vanilla a lot, and know a lot of things. But pservers have different values and can't compare to blizzards product.
---
To how to avoid skin cancer by never going outside to play wow mostly so i guess technically?
---
Do you have game time on your original account or another account on your Bnet?
---
Thx for sharing! 
---
When did you resubscribe?
---
How are those not the same thing?!
---
How was the blinking?
---
Yes i have a current sub. Since BFA Launch.
---
And they got rid of the toggle because it was to much of a hassle to maintain.
---
Reporting dumb shit as bugs is what really gets me. Gives me flashbacks to this one moron who was so vocal about bright wizards being underpowered in the warhammer online beta, causing them to get buffed right before launch.
---
A couple months after launch, I run into this guy and his pocket healer and shitcan both of them. He just fucking stood there and let me wail on him as a dok. Even months into the game he didn't have a clue how to play, and he was vocal as fuck in the beta.
---
At least classic wow is classic wow and this type of stupid shit is just going to get a laugh out if the dev team
---
Is the sub on your 05 account tho or another account on the Bnet
---
Tips did not give them there was a blizzard GM in chat and he would tell them who to give them to. There was a time where he was asking if the people he requested got an invite and he had to Dm their actual emails not just their twitch id.
---
As much as i do like mage I just need to be a spooky boy. So i gotta go warlock or shadow priest. and Warlock seems the more viable of the two.
---
You could hit tauren players on the other side of Nagrand pillars in TBC if you were also tauren.
---
[A Talking Head] - from a random drop in Silverpine Forest that starts a quest.  You don't ever have to start/complete the quest so you can just keep it in your inventory forever to link to people while you say weird stuff or are bored in groups.
---
If true thats interesting
---
Were you experienced in speed running before?
---
I have 2 accounts, honestly not sure which I added time to. I was concerned at first.
---
youre ignoring the out of combat benefits of an extra priest vs an extra mage
---
faster buffing, another rezzer for wipes, stuff like that.  same with boomkins, throw one of them in a group of 4 mages and watch the collective dps skyrocket. and retadins, that FR aura in a melee group on rag/bwl fights is pretty handy when the healers gotta stay far away.  
---
my point is they may look bad to an individual raider but as a raid leader thats been through aq40, 1 or 2 offspecs can be pretty handy to have in situations where it's not always obvious.
---
Like a month after he started making videos he came on here saying that he was just laid off and that because of the stress caused by it he would no longer be able to make videos. It was obvious bait for support and donations, and he started a Patreon acting like he never even considered it until people in the post suggested it.
---
5% is double?
---
I am concerned right now, I have 4 Vanilla accounts but my game time is on the oldest of them (late 2006)
---
Didn't Ion actually say that they were gonna try and get High Elves into the pipeline after all that hullabaloo about it last year?
---
No, that first comment is wrong. Gnomes get 5% more bad intellect
---
this proves pretty much nothing. now leave me alone, troll.
---
Soda was casting wrath without remotely paying attention to anything as tips died. What the shit are you talking about.
---
Low effort meme 2/10
---
He doesn't really have to be. He's mostly known for his entertainment factor on stream and for Classiccast, which will either be disbanding in August or rising in popularity as more of a news/tips podcast.
---
Theyre already doing a lesser version of that by opening up Character Creation 15 days before Classic releases.
---
Its already a cashgrab as is, so I think if they did something on that scale it would be poorly received.
---
I think people have a better chance of making it into the NFL.
---
That is a very solid point. Difficulty does not equate to time investment. I could say a thousand condescending things about those that think the two are the same, but weve probably all heard it before. What I will say is that I hope the new content they implement will reward cleverness and teamwork over time investment.
---
Considering there's no box cost for Classic, yeah, probably would have.
---
This is a party I can relate to.
---
Why do these posts keep popping up as if blizzard wasn't aware of the money they could make. They aren't trying to make money right now they are trying to test the game. The last time blizzard let people buy into a beta it was a cluster fuck that made bug testing harder. Blizzard know what they are doing in this situation

Indeed. Warlock is fantastic for both PvE and PvP. Threat control is he only sucky part since you basically do nothing for a bit which causes you to not do as much dmg as a Mage but that's life. Though with the rumours that mana regen is severly lower than on Pservers who knows. Lock might be better. Still very much viable for all content! Goodluck to you!
---
The character creation is just so people can reserve their names, and give blizzard an idea of how many people are planning to play in the first week.
---
Skill? You spelled genetics awfully strange.
---
I fucking boomed ya. Its almost upsetting how bad your ass just got tore up.
---
Cringe
---
I mean the guy might be borderline retarded but he still somehow gets people to watch him which is all blizzard gives a shit about.
---
are these servers balanced same as 1.12?
---
It goes back to your first sentence, people have the right to spend their money on what they want but also regardless of popularity or how much someone is worth, if they are entertaining to you and you enjoy the content what difference does it make? 
---
Watch a smaller less interesting streamer or a popular one that entertains you, I watch big, small and in between, its all about if i like their content really.
---
I think you over estimate how many people actually care what your character looks like. They care about they're own. If a toggle gives people more options then I don't see an issue.
---
Eh, 1-70 and 1-80 at normal experience still took about as long as a true vanilla 1-60. Those last 10 levels were tuned to be brutally long. At least 4 hours/level for a normal player even with the streamlined hubs.
---
If you had the same Outlands/Northrend grind on top of a 1.12 xp curve it would be ridiculous. (And it *was* ridiculous pre-2.3. I remember never even trying for a max level alt for a long ass time. Only made 19/29/39/49 twinks)
---
Right? I was actually surprised there was no ‚Äúone time fee‚Äù to play classic. Especially seeing how much work they have put into it.
---
I didn‚Äôt record it or anything but I just so happened to be watching when it happened and was kind of like wtf.
---
Wheres monk...
---
It's far less of a cash grab than retail. No box cost, and nothing like what OP is suggesting or other things like putting beta in with the 15th anniversary CE.
---
&gt; are fucking toxic as fuck.
---
The mindset and general shittery youtubers like tips will impart on the classic community if not called out will be significantly more toxic.
---
Guy should have shield blocked more.
---
Sounds like you belong in 'shitty' retail tho
---
yes it was
---
I could also use this info
---
I dont want to step into that puddle, lol. Lets go with probably not, no
---
Apparently Private wow server hunters 1-30 sub 20 hours.
---
Got one for daggers?
---
Coming in 8 years.
---
That wasn't really why. They got rid of it because they made a ton of new animations for Legion (like for various attacks and battle poses) and they didn't want to make new animations for both sets of skeletons. 
---
This would not be an issue on Classic as I believe the new models can perform all the Classic animations.
---
Nope but he is very charismatic and good at talking.
---
That's just wrong we need monks back!!
---
Of course. Just do it, see how far you can go.
---
The progress-guild im joining is also planing midnight pug raids. 
---
There will be raids for all kinds of people.
---
I said the same in another thread, but I think its generational. I dont understand the appeal of watching people play video games, but Im sure my parents dont understand the appeal of even playing video games. I did enough watching as a little brother haha.
---
I will hangout in front of SW and wait for duels to finish. I pop out, backstab the loser, vanish, and run off. I do that more than any of the other content.
---
If you have been dueling and then got killed by an Undead rogue named Pukebucket then thats what you get for going outside the city walls.
---
It scales off gear
---
awesome, thanks man.  totally thought i started in 2006, didnt realize i was a 2005er.
---
Big tip: just go straight. The area with all the winding paths is mostly misdirection. If you just go straight whenever you're given a choice you'll almost certainly find yourself taking the most efficient path.
---
Like this sub isn't a cesspool as well.
---
The difficulty of classic was with organization and socialization.
---
You succeed as a community and you failed as a community, it's not about individual skill.
---
That's what made Vanilla so much fun.  Your gear is a reflection of your reputation and contribution to that community.
---
It made for juicy drama, meaningful pvp, and good friendships.
---
If you're looking for something to showcase your individual skill, stick to FPS games.
---
They never seem to answer man, its like the most bizarre thing
---
God this sounds great.
---
Deadmines is easy as long as you know what you're doing. The main place you screw up is the forge room due to letting runners escape, unless you've build sufficient reducency into your kill strategy.
---
And accidently pulling Greenskin due to the LoS on the ramp being wonky.
---
That's the two main struggle points. The rest fully depends on people just knowing how to play they role they've chosen to play and accessing and using your party's resources appropriately.
---
always been that way. its the way spell batching interacts with server ticks.
---
Hey I just ran there and I see that the gates are closed
---
You may be right, but I think it‚Äôs unlikely, that‚Äôs my opinion.  
---
There are so many broken things in the game that is left to stay that way for way too long that I have lost the confidence that they are able to think or act rationally, especially since BFA. 
---
I doubt there is any logic into saying they set their mind on X amount of people on server so they didn‚Äôt sent it to so and so.  You‚Äôre talking about a handful of people here.  Not everyone will login at the beta at the same time, adding 15 more invites on top of it won‚Äôt be noticeable by anyone at all.  I don‚Äôt think you can rationalize this in any way or form, it‚Äôs just a fail from them.
---
IMO esfand and asmongold didn‚Äôt do to bad in VC.
---
Fake news QoL has nothing got to do with 'strength'
---
Low quality meme I give it a 5/10
---
I disagree. Asmongold has spend unfathomable hours playing WoW and thats what made him so popular.
---
&gt; What I will say is that I hope the new content they implement will reward cleverness and teamwork over time investment.
---
But therein lies the rub. 
---
Some players don't want any changes, not even cosmetic. 
---
Some players do want changes. 
---
The difficulty will be convincing the developers to take a chance. It's hard to get feedback when there's so many voices shouting different things and almost none of it is consistent. 
---
I know because I've had people tell me they don't want the new models in the game because it's "not the old WoW". This doesn't change anything and is purely aesthetic though...
---
Then the same people turn around and say "I want new content that isn't necessarily TBC or Wrath".
---
But...you just said you don't want things to change. They go from not wanting something ***purely*** aesthetic, to something that can literally change gameplay. 
---
¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
OP is suggesting that you would pay a full years subscription for beta access? thats a pretty step price to access a beta, which are generally free
---
Imp Sap
---
Yea that's the worrying part.
---
lmao the level of fanboy you have to be to try to defend tips in this scenario and deflect the blame to someone else
---
do you honestly think people aren't going to be able to do a level 20 dungeon without precasting heals and not using literally any other abilities?
---
I don‚Äôt really care to debate modern WoW, and its pretty easy to find examples yourself. Blizz has been focused on ‚Äúplayer engagement and retention‚Äù stats more then the game itself. If they see people doing say M+ consistently they will assume people are enjoying it. 
---
The reality is people follow the purples, so even if you hated Warfronts, Island Expeditions, the WQ Caches - if you did it for the loot anyway its a positive in Blizzards eye.
---
That doesn‚Äôt make for good gameplay in my eyes, either way like I said - I don‚Äôt care about modern WoW anymore. I played from Vanilla to WoD and a tiny bit of Legion and I didn‚Äôt like it for the same reason.
---
You mention that time was the mechanic to gate people in Vanilla, these days everything is gated by AP and iLvl.
---
If I logged in today, they‚Äôd ask for 400ilvl for a M+ I did close to release. If i‚Äôm going to play an MMO that feels like a treadmill - its going to be a slow one. Thats a player-problem but another reason I dislike modern WoW.
---
I have been playing pservers for 2 years now so I still obviously love the game - I just have zero interested in what its become.
---
do i have to have it installed to see that?
---
Shadowmeld is still AMAZING OP ... players don't have 360 vision ... and even if they see you suddenly appearing with aimed shot casting than before they react you are over halfway done 
---
You don't win wsg or ab by only fighting ... pugs only fight ... you want to play good? Choose good fights ... guard objectives ... increase your chances in fights that matter
---
I don't know if I agree with that chief, but to each their own.
---
He literally said yesterday on  the stream, im one of the best if not the best pvp warrior on NA, you can check it on the video, shortly after the left the starting zone
---
No, they opted it for it because they revamped it in preperation for BC. So they felt it was better to keep the original system since it was meant for classic.
---
Regardless this way of thinking makes no sense to determine whether or not a feature should be one way or another.
---
if you are talking about sword/sword combat and blue gear to start raiding then a 1.8 offhand was more important that dps. From memory Dal'rend set was bis if you could get it otherwise a 2.8 MH and Mirah's
---
Probably not
---
Staysafe got fucked by how bad voidwalker is. That thing cannot hold aggro at all.
---
Working as intended.
---
Same with that happened with RS3 when OSRS came out. Players dont want to admit the current game is bad. Now OSRS has 5 x the playerbase lmao
---
What's there point of just making stuff up though
---
The man, the legend. Did you have any trouble with griefing or were you just too high up for people to contest your aoe farms? Noticed some mages like being dicks for AOE farm and sheep my mobs or cause trouble because they want the spot. Seems like a thing to look out for when more players are on.
---
Same here. And it's awful, I really disliked doing uml diagrams and have never had to use it since, thankfully.
---
Lol is it really hard to believe that testing a game in different ways will reveal different issues?
---
I died all the time leveling up on a p server, and I played a gd hunter. Pet dies, time to fd. Shit, harpies are respawning. Make a run for it... nope, corpse run.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
So in PvP is a stealth level of 63 (just the talents) already enough for an enemy to normally not be able to see me unless I'm right on top of them?
---
And yea for PvE it's just a fringe case. I was thinking it might allow me to sneak past mobs that I would have to wait for vanish to come off cd to normally sneak past. And for druids who don't have vanish. And I wasn't thinking just for soloing, but also for when I die in a dungeon/raid and have to run back to my group from the entrance but there are respawns.
---
I played the AH in legion when gold was easy to get. Have 10 tokens, the max you can buy waiting for classic haha
---
My rule of thumb, for tanks and even DPS, is that the final boss should be orange to you, and not red. So, for instance, SFK, Arugal is 26, I don't want DPS under 22 if I can help it. But a 22 tank will do just fine.
---
Uldaman, Last boss is 47, so DPS and Tank should be 43+. It's just gonna be a bad time if you get to the hardest boss, and you cant even hit/sunder and get threat. But that doesn't mean the DPS should get away with vastly underleveling the boss either.
---
Thats just my go-to strat, since I'm normally the dude forming the group.
---
What reports?
---
Does he like classic though? You'd think someone trying to make money off it would put some sort of effort towards learning the game and getting better. Hell, most of the people in the game will be doing that without getting paid. He seems to put in the least amount of effort of any youtuber or streamer. Usually just finding one or two things he can talk about and then just guessing on the rest with what he thinks makes sense, even though it's clearly wrong and easily verifiable through a 15 second google search. At least, that's the impression I got from the videos of his I tried to watch when people recommended him. I'm sure as hell not going to bother even putting his stream on in the background. I guess if he's targeting new players with his videos they won't realize how wrong and lazy he is until later.
---
.
---
/agree
---
I'm still not seeing why you can't just be happy for people who got in and wait for the actual game to drop instead of wasting time complaining about something that has already happened that you can't change
---
No
---
Maybe
---
is your HPS with bandaids comparable to a druid, priest, or paladin? If so, sure!
---
What? The bosses all have 2-3 mechanics, usually a dodge fire, dispel or basic tankswap. Also, class rotations were non-existant for half the classes. Vanilla raiding was on a mechanical level with todays normal mode.
---
Why would any of them be flagged for PvP?
---
Nobody knows
---
Lmao I just polymorph allies and somehow they done die idfk
---
Tbh i‚Äôm going to be 10/10 dissappointed if they don‚Äôt ride it til BC at least, maybe LK.
---
Omg I was thinking those trolls seemed hard as fuck, but being over a decade since retail I wasn't sure.
---
I‚Äôm talking about retail. War mode. 
---
I still do this shit.
---
Yeah that one!
---
He said something about a blizzard friend getting him in because they definitely passed him over first go.
---
I dunno. I watch a few streamers, and Asmon seems to struggle to find something to say, so will just repeat something over and over. I appreciate that it's difficult but other people seem to manage it.
---
The basics of pulling murlocs is you can't pull just one :p
---
Funny story about that.
---
my very first time using the meeting stone system to get a group was for Deadmines.
---
it took about 2 hours and made us a group consisting of 2 priests, 2 mages, and a rogue.
---
And to it's credit we actually beat it pretty smoothly. This however was fairly early vanilla right around the time they allowed you to queue via inn-keepers, and they supposedly refined the grouping algorithims a lot after that.
---
Pretty sure you cant turn the flag off on PVP server.
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the reply
---
You can in an uncontested zone.  That's what stops people from camping lowbies all day.
---
why would you blow 100+ dollars to level 1-30 in a 3 month beta. Yeah it'd be fun to play but people gotta simmer down on this a little bit. The way they're doing it looks to be the best way.
---
I watched some of his videos and a lot of things just seemed off about him. I could accept him saying a bunch of dumb shit because I knew he was a private server baby. I never messed with private servers so I never really knew how different it was. After seeing him play though omg. I laughed pretty hard though. He was trying to play it off like he is just doing horrible on purpose. And he deleted the cloak... what was that about? The dude is such a raging idiot. I mean I hope he can handle getting shit on though. I‚Äôm not an advocate for cyber bullying but that dude could seriously use a good really sponsored bully in his life.
---
Yea I know what you mean. I think we all have an idea in our heads what classic should be. For some people its a pure copy. For others its minor QoL changes. And then for some its basically WoW 2.0 with all the faults worked out. It will be impossible to please everyone. I know what I want to see, but thats only worth something to me haha. I think the safest bet will be to include a lot of customization. Make as much as you can optional, like graphics and UI improvements and then hope for the best. I know Ill never get exactly what I want but like most people Im just trying to recapture that feeling I had "back then". I also know thats impossible. You can never step into the same river twice, and all that.
---
Thanks. I guess you do need an active sub to get an invite.
---
Haha oh man it was a nightmare. I was trying to find my way back to Menethil and I could just hear myself getting eaten. I gave up I think,  in the end. Can't remember what I did after that. Probably just turned the computer off and got mad.
---
This isnt accurate tho. It shows my 4 vanilla accounts as 2007 - 2008. We THINK it might be because of too many purchases over the years burying the dates too far down to see or something but we have all but confirmed it to be inaccurate for some
---
Hi, /u/sorryidontknowher
---
I played the real Vanilla in ‚Äò04, leveled a hunter to 45 via Melee because I thought pets were annoying to deal with. Good chance I wasn‚Äôt even 13 yet!
---
I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd call myself a vet as much as a tourist. A proper huntard!
---
Ok but 5% is much smaller than 100%
---
Sub on my original account only have 1.
---
Until that guy you left alone because he was at 30% rolls up on you later with his friends and they kill you. It's either gank or get ganked; being friendly rarely pays off. Get them HKs.
---
Because I have an active subscription anyway so it‚Äôs basically free garnered beta access.
---
gamer tells all!! How to get great skin in 1 easy step! dermatologists hate him..

This wait is gonna be the death of me
---
I am curious if demon names can be duplicates. My Warlock's (created in July 2005) demons are:
---
Imp -Tarpep
---
Voidwalker - Helgak
---
Succubus - Cattrah
---
Felhunter - Sloolum
---
Anyone else have same names here?
---
I mean most likely yes. I cant' imagine blizzard is going to just say fuck it, guess how stable you're gonna be on a server you plan to play long term.
---
Jokes on you, doing my MBA rn
---
I would be awesome if someone handed a T-Shirt with that quote to Brack himself on the next Blizzcon 2019 :D
---
only the future will tell
---
... express yourself my man
---
Where are the best erp spots in classic?
---
Maybe the market for streaming Classic is to tune into really bad players just failing over and over! I‚Äôd probably watch that over a normal stream lol.
---
the improved drain soul talent on warlock is bugged, the talent says you will obtain the effects if the target dies "while" you drain its soul, but currently it only gives you the effects if drain soul actually does the last hit.
---
News to me. I think this is as close as people can get short of contacting Blizzard. Mine went back to my 10 day guest pass in 05 whereas the main site only had history back to 2012.
---
&gt; that was fats
---
Come on man low blow. Don't hate on the dude for his weight.
---
Vanilla is not the only speed running record he set, he also did castlevania 1 and 4 though i think people have passed him on those by now since hes been out of the game working on classic stuff.
---
Why would it not work in classic? Genuinely wondering.
---
Let me rephrase:
---
They know what their long-term hardcore proven fanbase wants. They also know what will siphon money from a new short-term casual demographic. These groups want very different things. 
---
Blizzard is basically ignoring their long-term fanbase in favor of short-term profits.
---
I was reading this while watching his stream. He said he quit his job for this shit. If he keeps pretending to be good at this game he is going to lose his fan base... I think he could really turn it around if he owned up to how bad he was. Hahahaha now he‚Äôs talking about the jump again. Suggesting that he did it on purpose just for chat. Man this guy is even cringier than that trainwrecks weirdo.
---
Ya, a few people have had it showing wrong dates but it should work for most people probably.
---
~~YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO PLAY VANILLA IF IT LOOKS LIKE SHIT~~
---
I just want random dungeons and flying mounts gone.
---
It‚Äôs has electrolytes
---
I remember when they added rain, i loved it. i would pull up a rain/lightning audio on youtube to go along with it.
---
Seems the levelling is slower than those other servers.. How did you find it?
---
Thats the reason I always hated public betas and devs using them as a demo. Nothing gets fixed because people treat it like a full-game.
---
Look, you dont have to be a fanboy. I dont give a fuck about soda, and as of this debacle, not a fan of tips either.
---
But theyre both in the wrong, as they were both unprepared. Verdan is a tough boss, and they werent expecting it. Tips goes in, gets hit to like 60% in 1 shot, healer gets in range, then casts a spell, tips dies, then soda opens up his character to admire his boots or something, and then is like "wtf!"
---
They were both obviously caught off guard by that boss. Verdan aint no joke.
---
Bruh.
---
Gods speed troll man.
---
They are both fucking morons.... I was trying to imply soda is just as bad üòÇ 
---
That boss hits like a truck, it isn't broken, working as intended, these idiots couldn't tell their arse hole from their ear hole. 
---
Why, are you mad I'm not defending soda?
---
I NEED IT
---
Probably a different monitor too.
---
He did what?
---
Worked for me after not being able to find mine. Mine is from 12/2004...now to get that invite ha
---
You just gave me some nam flashbacks to the bug forums on Catas Heroic release.. people did not like the challenge and it got nerfed hard.
---
Good thing the share holders think it's bfa doing this, otherwise craptavision will add MTX to classic.
---
Lol. "You're killing me while in killing a mob" 
---
"He fucking podded"
---
What
---
A
---
Cry 
---
Baby.
---
Play on a pve server, child
---
I hope it's 1 x pvp, 1 x pve, 1 x RP and that's it.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/H1SZEr3.png](https://i.imgur.com/H1SZEr3.png)
---
So, instead of using this new technology, you want blizzard to go back to sharding the starting area, ruining immersion for EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. that makes a character. While also introducing a massive bottleneck at the barrens when the pack reaches it. How is that better than layering?
---
YES can we see Tauren vs Human?
---
Instead you just keep killing their quest hub NPCs.
---
You will never be able to play Vanilla, Classic though yes lol. Vanilla had a lot of ways to manipulate the game using macro/scripts etc. which made it really fun!
---
I heard classic is best in a slot for WoW
---
So will the shareholders.
---
Not sure the fortnite meme team will survive classic though.

Funny how in one of his videos he was comparing BfA to classic WoW and he was mostly for BfA and here he is playing the beta for classic wow. I guess this what a money/view whore would do. Disgusting.

---
I mean you're right in the sense that people such as Kargoz or other content creators deserve much more praise than Tips. But to claim that he doesn't like Classic? I mean, his entire Instagram and YouTube alike are filled with Classic content (whether his information in those videos are all valid I don't know), but 2 days ago he made a 30 minute long video about the beta, in fact he uploaded three seperate videos. I don't watch him personally apart from a few videos I've seen when I was starving for Classic content, but it doesn't really seem to me that he's just in it for the fame. If you look at his earliest videos you can easily see how he struggled getting 10K views and a even doing a 100 subscriber giveaway back when he was a nobody. Maybe I'm just a gullible retard but I do believe that he just likes the game and wants to play and make content.
---
This does not give me hope for the general wow population haha
---
Madseasons is actually Joe Pera. Get him fuckin access. He deserves it. Even if he sucks at the game he made a lot of cool content. Tips just talks out of his ass and sounds like a moron.
---
Was looking for something like this thanks! Can finally prove I'm part of the 04 crew
---
He learned that the hard way. He did at least admit to it to some degree in his beta video.
---
10/10
---
Truly astounding levels of fanboy
---
Twitch speak is so dam common...
---
REeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
haha i‚Äôm not really mad. i‚Äôm suspecting the beta will be much larger than people expect
---
I had no idea there were no EU servers for over a year
---
i def was playing at least months before nax but im pretty sure all the other raids were out when i started , no idea what year that was
---
If he just pulled the boss, and he and the heals werent ready for it, and that was it... I'd laugh, and be like, yep, that guys hard.
---
But the whole bug report just sold me on unsubbing.
---
Those guys had degrees apparently...
---
Ah, I heard from somewhere it was open. My bad. Are you able to check if the Elemental invasion is on?
---
The best thing about using a pot is that you know the other person is getting so mad that he is breathing through his mouth
---
The huge mass of "no changes, ever!" people. We even had an outrage thread about the new models being included in the game client, with no proof if they were even usable in the game.
---
You never had the chance to play **vanilla** WoW.
---
Freezing Trap can be charged through as warrior.
---
YAY! Didn‚Äôt consider that really. An interesting thought - if they release TBC do you think they will sell lvl 58 boosts? I can see it being a ‚Äúget them in the game‚Äù thing unfortunately.
---
lol!
---
My NA server called it DM. I think it just depends but 60-70% of people know it as DM from what I‚Äôve seen in polls.
---
Epic marketing plan. Force players who know how to play to wait and only allow them access to watch shitty players play. Then even if they weren‚Äôt really going to play classic at release they are obliged to fulfill their destiny.
---
 2007
---
I don't think any racials were base stat boost only until Wrath or even Cata.
---
Taurens also had 5% more total. Not just base.
---
Yeah I can't imagine watching wow live. Especially just questing
---
Combat swords is really the best leveling spec period. Daggers work but are slower IMHO
---
Because a lot of people complained. I'm pretty sure Blizzard have specifically said that they will honor the communities wishes and stay as true to the original Vanilla experience as possible. They won't nerf Verdan's damage without checking actual numbers from their 1.12 client just because one streamer (or multiple) reports it to be "too much". Cataclysm was very different.
---
Yeah seems the most logical. What do you recommend at 60 though?
---
It does shadow damage when it hits you but once you tame it, it does physical damage
---
How viable was aoe farming at 20 and how much better did it get on your way to 30
---
So specific, why do you want this information??
---
Stitches dies to town guards anyway. First SUMMON i guess?
---
Hupsz, fixed
---
Combat swords all the way man
---
It used to deal shadow damage, even after it was tamed. I think 1.12 was actually the patch that fixed that IIRC
---
I think it shares a space with faerie fire. So you can have one of FF||CoR and one of Sunder||Expose.
---
ikr lmao. i thought i was nuts looking up how to get stockade pauldrons
---
And a reasonably good attitude.
---
Yea but if you‚Äôve been at one of these companies you realize that the people are idiots. Doesn‚Äôt matter where you go in life, you can‚Äôt escape stupidity and lack of original thought. Maybe if you‚Äôre a top engineer at lockheed you can escape it, not sure though.

I thought Guzu's reaction was appropriate. Gets hunted while fighting a mob, gets the hunter down to 1% before they potion, I would be frustrated. This other dude though was painful to watch.
---
There were dedicated servers for OCE but they were hosted in US.
---
So I wasn‚Äôt clear by what OCE server meant.
---
Those pictures are literally night and day.  The water was a lot harder to see through during the day in Azeroth.

It seriously is very fun. One of those stupid things you don't really know you need until you have it.

Very interesting comparison with OSRS - do they still pump out new content for OSRS and RS3 simultaneously?
---
So my original account was made in 04, my second in 05, and 3rd in 06. All are linked to my bnet account. My 3rd account is the one that's been active since 06, and did not get beta invite yesterday. However I subbed on my original day 1, Nov 04 account, today, and got in the beta 5/16, via my bnet.
---
Now, I have no idea how to check and see if that was the reason I got in or not on 5/16. Could be a mighty coincidence.
---
Those pictures are taken at the right time to make his argument.  I've snuck through quite a few places during daylight on Classic that have much less vision than that.
---
I recommend trying this  [https://gamerkit.co.uk/products/19-button-fully-programmable-12000dpi-mmo-mouse](https://gamerkit.co.uk/products/19-button-fully-programmable-12000dpi-mmo-mouse)  for a cheaper alternative.
---
Really? I would expect a backstab spec would be more useful since the tank would have all the aggro and I‚Äôd just be standing behind mobs most of the time
---
So he totally ignores Westfall while leveling?
---
I suspect the active Classic player base will over take the number of retail players even after things setting down. I am curious what direction will blizz take with classic (And retail) if they find that the interest in classic is great than that in retail.
---
(Probably nothing) But how awesome would it be if Classic introduced new quests, dungeons and raids while maintaining the level 60 skill cap? (continuous horizontal progression) There area so many back stories, books, comics etc that were never addressed in vanilla before TBC that could be told in vanilla fashion while still remaining canon.
---
Other than quests, how could xp values be different?  Mob xp is a simple formula for almost all mobs.
---
Cue Ghostcrawler crawling back
---
its ok, i dont want to burn out in beta
---
Well the devs reading the bug report need a good laugh sometimes too.
---
Ah! A quick cash in versus the long term investment. Fair enough!
---
This sub is not that bad man. If you want cancer go to the private server sub.
---
Combat sword will always be the best when you have heals because blade flurry is awesome if you don't mind taking extra damage. You can go daggers if you know you're always, or at least 95% of the time levelling with a warrior/hunter/druid or something but it's not better - just fun to backstab things.

You're a very nice person dude, thanks a lot for helping out. I wish you the best of luck in all your endeavours, you deserve it :) Take care and enjoy classic, maybe you get lucky and get a beta invite.

He said mages not gnomes specifically. So getting an int buff as a passive is a no brainer.

This just in: people get excited and hyped for a product before it comes out and then interest wanes afterwards, more news at 11.

The dark carnival of human nature is ever-present, given a shroud of anonymity is overtakes the soul.
---
Its been a hot minute but I am pretty sure with a huge slow 1h sword, SS hits like a truck
---
TBC/Wrath are *MUCH* more likely than fresh Vanilla content that requires actual development time.
---
They weren't saying gnomes get double intellect, they say mages get so much more out of intellect than any other class, so gnome suits em well
---
hmmm yeah actually i remember my server was WAAAaaaay behind on raids.
---
I searched my email for blizzard (payment history) and had completely forgotten about my account being hacked in 2010. Holy hell that was a  stressful time. I was on vacation and watched the emails pour in on my phone about password changes, account lock, possible keylogger, suspicious activity, yikes. I wonder if that will keep me out of the beta lol.
---
You were in Vodka?
---
Lol no, you're very wrong. Almost anyone born in at least 2004 and after know what WoW is.
---
&gt; You are arguing that 9k players should share the resources designed to support 3k players.
---
No, dont put words into my mouth. Im saying the resources should spawn based on total server population and spawns should be determined based on number of players in each layer.
---
Im saying that if you have 9k players in same server without layers, you get the same spawnrates, when you have 3x 3k pop layers. Ppl are assuming that just because there are layers, it automatically means every spawn is multiplied by number of layers.
---
Spawn rates are COMPLETELY different matter to layers.
---
Pretty sure that was in /r/wowservers ?

HE CALLED THE COPS ON SOMEONE BECAUSE OF A YOUTUBE COMMENT
---
I find gearing up in classic much more meaningful. Good gear at level 20 feels really great to find or make too. 
---
I never played vanilla wow until recently. My brother his wife and I just finished RFC and it was really fun. The pacing is so different from modern dungeons it's really quite interesing. Modern wow is so incredibly neurotic. You just blow through content without a second thought. It's kinda sad because people are so focused on getting to max level that they never really read the quests or lore. Most people are in it just to get the best stuff.
---
Classic wow really feels like you are exploring a world, and that you have to prove your worth to get to explore that world. Whereas modern wow just wants you to skip everything to play the next expansion. Hence the ability to boost your character.
---
Here's my deal.
---
I don't hate T-Mog itself. I'm just leery of giving people even more reasons to ninja crap.
---
I would be totally fine for T-Mog on RP servers, and have no real restrictions on what you could Mog into what, as long as you've owned the piece of gear you're attempting to Mog. 
---
Such as wanting to be a "battle-mage" and having some plate mogs to let your character look more battle-hardened and girded for war (even though it's purely visual) as well as being able to function well without compromising form.
---
For normal though, I just have a harder time justifying it. And PvP would be especially annoying.
---
Less than 10 average viewers during irregular streams are enough to get you "content creator"-privileges?  
---
brb, downloading OBS.
---
Yes, my glory years :)
---
This. The "font size" is amount of pixels allocated (in height) per character, there's a high chance you could still read the smaller one if you lowered your screen resolution to 480p again, OP.
---
That breaks immersion, not good solution.
---
I played back in '04 and I'm doing my masters now.
---
Wish I was done though
---
It's not so much of "chat" at that point as it is a reactionary hive mind. It can be interesting to watch certain copypastas pick up stream and die out, and to predict how other people will react to things. Sometimes you can also find memes that are literally born in that chat and spread to other channels for a few days before fading away into history. 
---
I have way way too much time spent watching busy twitch channels though, so I'm sure it's less interesting to a normal person. I enjoy it as a kind of sociology experiment though.
---
good shit you were way ahead of everyone!  i heard on other streams you were aoe grinding, what were the main spots you hit during the leveling? thoughts on regen rates for health/mana or any other bugs that might make mages stronger/weaker at the moment?
---
Isn't that normal in nowadays society where everyone goes rabid from all the hype generated by new products.
---
With this new technology you won't even be able to get out of Valley unless they add dynamic respawns or shard the starter zones ontop of the layering. I hope for dynamic respawns obviously but all I said was that it doesn't make for a smooth launch at all.
---
If I have to choose between sharding the starter area or layering without dynamic respawns I choose the former every single day, that way after 2-3 hours you join the rest of the world and everything is vanilla. Also the bottleneck in barrens will be much thinner because people level at different speeds, some people log out, remake their character, go afk for a bit, have to sleep(EU midnight release) to work the next day etc etc.
---
Exposed and Sunder stack on some private servers. On retail I don‚Äôt recall if they did. I don‚Äôt think so.
---
That's certainly me. Was good at shooters in my teens but useless at basically everything else. And now, 10-15 years later, even my one specialty has faded away

Fortunately I'm not trying to hardcore raid, MT, or do both while streaming to thousands :D I can just silently suck spamming shadowbolt at the back of the raid.

Vanilla and early TBC was a different world, even trashmobs could beat the living shit out of you...
---
You yourself state it's probably a bug and you exploited this bug in order to personally gain access to a beta trial.  
---
While I rly doubt it's worth blizz's time and effort this would be enforceable as a breach of tos- but then an awful lot of grey area stuff is.  That's how tos are written now, so the company has all the cards. /Shrug
---
That was exactly what I used to think. Hell, I was the guy that stealthed around random and relatively off the beaten path areas looking for enemy players to gank (I felt like it was scarier to be attacked in a quiet part of the map where you don't expect enemy players rather than major roads). On my hunter, I imagined a rogue behind every tree and had my "track humanoid" on everywhere I went, set traps in my escape routes if a rogue ambushed me. I was definitely about that wpvp life.
---
But these days, it's just hard for me to get into that state of mind. Even though I don't have children yet, I just have too much of that "dad" mentality. I want people to have fun, and I'd feel bad for making other people's experiences worse. Even if someone tried to gank me, and I kill him, I'd just leave or give him a chance to leave rather than corpse camp him because maybe he's just a noob trying out wpvp for the first time. My teenage self would call me "soft", but may it's just my priority shifted.
---
That being said, I'll still hunt down and camp any level 60's I see in low leveling areas ganking lowbies.
---
Grats on 30! What kind of testing are you planning. Do you have a favourite build or do you play what is needed. Pvp or Pve? Why Mage? Why Gnome? What were you eating when you hit 30?
---
17th of february 2006 was my account created but I cannot see any transactions prior to 2012 when I added the authenticator.

They also waited, and earned the opportunity through their streaming career. Chill out, they're just having fun. You would never fuck around in a beta, im sure.

Very nice :)

My son is 9 so he's close to getting his own battle net account, gonna try classic with him when it's released. But he'll get his own account ^^
---
Not sure why people share account.
---
What is pog? I keep seeing it everywhere but I‚Äôm out of the loop.
---
Hah! I'm really enjoying this TheMechanic dude. Was rooting for the rogue here though.
---
Wtb rent your account 150$
---
But aren't layers supposed to be 3k players each? There doesn't seem to even be 1k players on the beta server. Hopefully the stress tests will give them good feedback in sharding and layering.
---
I'm pretty sure Lupos was patched in vanilla, which means it'll almost certainly be patched in 1.12-based Classic.
---
How many of those 100k clicked in thinking it was Nicolas Cage?
---
Im pretty sure i‚Äôll get close to what I want. #nochanges but I am not OCD enough to care about updated models etc - in Modern WoW its an in-game option so people who don‚Äôt like new models can flick it off and literally play how they want.
---
I‚Äôd rather slower content releases over faster, and obviously NOTHING new in regards to quests / dungeons.
---
Zero tuning whatsoever, as stupid as it is to have dead specs thats what I want. WoW Classic with Boomkins and Rets topping meters would be a game killer..
---
I think they‚Äôll shy away from changes, because the people who want nochanges will definitely not play a revised version of the game, but the people who want changes weren‚Äôt going to play normal Classic anyway..
---
Do you think it would make sense to potentially kill your original classic fanbase in hopes non-players will come to WoW? Seems like a bad move imo.
---
Out of 17 viewable players there are 4 mages (23.5%), 3 hunters, paladins (17.6% each), 2 Warriors, Druids (11,8% each) and 1 warlock, rogue, priest (5,9% each).
---
Super small sample size, but do you think it could reflect anything of class choices? (esp. the number of mages)

So suddenly we're all sharing our account transaction history to get more e-cred and beta invites?
---
They already said they're open to the idea of new Classic content.
---
Who said anything about me having a high impact on them??? I'm doing it to be a fucking asshole...And if many people are ganking tons of people cross faction it hinders how fast they can get to max level. It hinders the opposite faction from progressing further. Im not implying i would make a huge impact but to say ganking in general serves no impact is kinda ignorant. Don't come at me with stupidity.
---
My friend, this is what Classic is about. Explore, get lost, make friends, laugh, love, cry... its all a part of the process.
---
Got to get that streamer hate in there, you know.
---
Did you use any guides at all?
---
Lol good stuff. It's funny how these little world pvp skirmishes are good little tests of knowing your class and making decisions. Esfand should have healed the warrior and not let him die. Asmon if he kept running would have dropped combat and could charge away. Esfand had bop available to use and could have had BoW on the whole time for 150+ mana that meant he could have healed and lived longer.
---

A long time, meaning 2016+? Cause he sure as hell had no clue about private servers before nostalrius shutdown.
---
I can't either. I do remember a lot of stuff, but.. Only name of a boss in ZG I know the name of is Hakkar. And I did ZG so many times.
---
It'll come back to both of us when we do play though, after 2-3 scholo runs we'll know everything about that instance (as if we'd done it 100 times ;D)
---
I feel like the percentage of paladins that want to play ret is way higher than shamans that want to play enhancement.
---
Ret paladin just magically attracts special kind of weirdos.

---
Even if p servers had never existed, the most dedicated guilds would still run through shit light years faster than they did on release. End of vanilla knowledge alone would ensure that.
---
And say what you will about p server players, but plenty of shit they know how to do will translate perfectly. Things like shot rotations, world buffs before raids, and knowing where to get their bis gear will be standard knowledge for p server players. Any adjustments based on different armor values will be trivial compared to knowing your class inside and out before you even step into MC.

Even actively trying to upgrade my gear, most of the good stuff felt amazing even 10 levels later.
---
Aoe grinding
---
Remember reading about this in PC Gamer's magazine all those years ago, holy shit. This is probably how I was introduced to the Misfits.
---
I'm not a programmer, I'm the wrong dude to ask. 
---
If I was to hazard a guess though, I'd guess maybe the time between mobs (mob density, amount of eating/drinking, how much damage they do, etc) maybe that could be different. There's all sorts of things though. Item drop rates, mana recharge rates, mob damage (more damage = more healing needed to be done between fights)... All of that's contributes to how much time it takes to level. So you're right maybe it's not about XP.
---
&gt; You mention that time was the mechanic to gate people in Vanilla, these days everything is gated by AP and iLvl.
---
Massive differences. Time gating is a barrier of entry imposed by the developers. It is exclusively linked to gear as well since you have to typically spend a lot of time to get the best gear available. Otherwise you cannot progress. It has nothing to do with how good you are at the game and everything to do with how much time you can spend getting to that point. 
---
These days, gear is amazingly easy to come by. If anything it's a "soft" gate and not a concern. The thing that prevents you from getting into a group is your Achievement for that raid or event that is being organized. 
---
"Whisper AotC or don't bother joining". AotC is the achievement "Ahead of the Curve", meaning that you killed the last boss of that raid on Heroic difficulty. 
---
As in, you have to prove that you're actually good at the game, and know the fight before you are allowed to join. 
---
Best part about being a good player? Sometimes I wouldn't have the AotC because I hadn't done it yet. So I would link my other achievements that proved that I was good. Sometimes I would use the previous raid tier and link the last mythic boss achievement for that. Worked pretty much every time. 
---
One thing I like about Modern WoW is that content only gets marginally easier with better gear. It still depends heavily on how good you are at the game. The catch up mechanics they introduce make sure that it isn't so much the gear that makes the player (and subsequently the time they spent getting it), but the player being good at the game.
---
Not quite a circlejerk, it's going to be true. Even on the retail subreddit, many of their top posts are about classic. And we are only in beta months away from the release, I think that classic will gain more and more attention. Even if you think that Classic will "die" after a few months because most people are only "tourists", that's still going to be half a year or more of Classic being more popular than retail.
---
I don't think Classic will ever dip below retail though, at least not to bfa. I think that it will be Classic and maybe future TBC servers that carries the subscription numbers for WoW.
---
What? The whole reason you are here is because the game changed.
---
I know you have down syndrome, but please: keep those idiotic retard shit statements to your self my dude.
---
&gt;is a laptop with a mouse fine as a set up or will I need more than that?
---
Very likely that'll be fine. But once there's a relatively large world PvP fight, you might run into problems with serious framerate drop. Just depends on the power of the cpu/gpu on the laptop.
---
&gt;what will I need to survive playing classic?
---
1. Take your time. A lot of people will rush to 60, but content release is not time gated, it's based on the server's progression as a whole. They didn't release exact details, but I would say that it's safe to assume we all have more than enough time to reach 60 and experience the initial dungeon/raid experience without having to incur sleep deprivation to level ASAP. Also, the "Layering" that they are adding will probably save you the headache of fighting for mobs.
---
2. A good sense of humor when you die to either difficult quest mobs or when ganked. It's going to happen, don't stress out over it.
---
3. It's a long climb to 60 and you need to make friends along the way. I would recommend being chatty with people in VOIP's.
---
4. Don't be afraid to leave a guild that's getting on your nerves and/or is toxic. There will be many.
---
Bet those who were shitting on Classic saying ‚Äúno one will play it‚Äù are shitting themselves right now. Retail will be a ghost town became this is objectively a better mmorpg. It‚Äôs going to be like OSRS/Runescape lol!
---
As a Warlock main throughout Vanilla, I recall that it required it being the killing damage to get the effect for at least parts of vanilla. I do believe it was changed by 1.12, though, so I think you are right. Either way, an interesting thing for them to check, I think.
---
I've played at max level of every expansion except vanilla and wod.
---
Cata heroics were my 2nd favorite dungeon sets of all time. Right behind BC heroics.
---
Cata dungeons were so fucking good and then they got fucking nerfed into the ground by morons who couldn't play the game.
---
"Open to the idea" is not the same as "it's going to happen".
---
I can't speak for everyone, but personally I am much more interested in TBC or Wrath than I am new Classic content.
---
Really? I'm betting classic will sit between 35-50% of Modern. Theres just too many people, that started playing in MoP/WoD/Legion, who will come to check out this new loud thing and get their butt destroyed by a pack of murlocs, or get annoyed that they cant hit max in 6 hours of grinding, before getting mad and going back to their rep grinds.
---
grass grows in like 3 days
---
I WAS THEREEEEEEEEEEEE
---
So you understand the want/desire to not be grouping with a-holes but you disagree on a method that allows you to remember they were total a-holes so you can efficiently remember who is an a-hole?
---
lol Same thing happened to me, week-long fishing trip, came back to find my account banned. For me it was really easy getting it sorted out, though. No cell service where we were all camping so I didn't know until I got home lol
---
No. They didnt
---
Or as warlock you can curse the mobs with CoR (max rank increases their attack power by 90), it's so much attack power at that level that the mobs will kill lowbies.
---
Yes and that is the point? Let people decide which models they wish to see
---
To be fair you really need a map coordinates addon to make full use of thottbott.

Thank you very much

But he used one too.
---
Both of those have a finite end. If we progress to wrath, the experience is over on ~6 years.
---
If we make new classic content, we can literally go forever. Nobody though OSRS would last, but here we are 5 are years later bigger than the main game

That could be WoW.

And yea for PvE it's just a fringe case. I was thinking it might allow me to sneak past mobs that I would have to wait for vanish to come off cd to normally sneak past, as well as for druids who don't have vanish. And I wasn't thinking just for soloing, but also for when I die in a dungeon/raid and have to run back to my group from the entrance but there are respawns.

---
People have been playing Vanilla-Wrath for over a decade, and there's still *tons* of hype for new servers when they launch.
---
I'm not against new content for vanilla die-hards, but I think the majority of people would prefer TBC/Wrath because the gameplay mechanics are just flat-out better.
---
I think the choice would be fine, but because they use different skeletons it means they must use different animations which gets really messy with hugs, when retail had the option for model swaps they forced all the new animations on the old models which I would be against tbh. 
---
They could fix this but that would require more development time that I would prefer spent on more important things.
---
If/When they release TBC or unreleased raid content like kharazan from vanilla that's when shit will go crazy (assuming after release it tapers off a little) 
---
I can imagine a couple years from now blizzard playing an updated TBC reveal cinematic, hype would be fucking unreal haha
---
I approve of the TPB / WoW memes and formally request more 
---
Corey, Trevor, memes lets go
---
A clown fiesta
---
Level 36, this a pserver screenshot?
---
ATM it seems like the only people to get in the beta are: streamers/content creators, and people with accounts that were created in 2004/2005.
---
I mean, I remember how Classic looked, and I've played emulations of Classic several times over the years.  That picture is not accurate to how I've used water in every iteration of Classic I've ever played.
---
A still image at night is a lot different than how it looks during the day, with more light reflecting off of the surface and the texture moving.
---
No 4:3? 
---
MY IMMERSION!!!
---
Why not just check your wow game licenses at https://account.blizzard.com/games ?
---
I'm totally with you. My guess would be that since switchable character models is something that's not currently in the game or supported by the client and would have to be created from scratch, it's pretty low on the priority list. It could easily be added in a later patch though.
---
Even with full mp5 and spirit gear you'll go oom if you use all your spells. It's better to stack shadow damage and just mind flay. You'll still do crap DPS but you'll only eat two debuff slots with one of them buffing the warlocks.
---
You'll never be a DPS class, you're a support class.
---
What does CE mean?
---
Yep lol
---
But YOUR vanilla experience remains unchanged.
---
While someone else who might prefer new models has a better experience for themselves. 
---
It doesn't hurt YOUR vanilla experience in any way. Just might make some other players happier - without ever influencing you.
---
Seems just very selfish and self-centered to me.
---
Might I point out that
---
1. This is an adaptation of a 2k4 game. Its not supposed to be a 2k19 game. You have BFA for that.
---
2. Adding to the first point, OSRS has refrained from adding A LOT of stuff that would be considered by you as necessary modern mechanics. So dont falsely misrepresent OSRS to use it as an example.
---
3. The fact you cant imagine why people wouldnt want sharding  indicates that this game might just not be for you. So why are you on this subreddit?
---
Stock UI is fine. Just get swing timer if you‚Äôre melee (to see when your auto attacks hit) and titanpanel to display xp per hour and other useful info
---
Exactly that ! Thank you!
---
I assume they can set the layer max easily to whatever they want. They could trigger 5 layers with 10 people each probably. Just to test the balancing mechanisms small scale. Haven't seen any evidence they've done that though.
---
Gnome best alliance race for mage
---
Yep.
---
My vanilla experience changes because I have the ability to use models that aren‚Äôt part of classic
---
Dude when you do an AMA, you're not supposed to got to sleep right away :D
---
I've never understood this. You're literally talking about TBC. Same devs that created Vanilla created TBC with very similar goals - at the very least the same core design philosophy. Heck, some things in Vanilla weren't even intended to be the way they were, they just were because the dev team didn't have enough to to iterate and reach what they wanted. Take spec balance for example - Kevin Jordan says time and time again in his interviews on Countdown to Classic that a lot of the class specs weren't where he wanted them, they just didn't have the time to get them where he did (such as Prot and Ret Pally).
---
I wish I could the source, but I do recall listening to an interview with another class designer from Vanilla/TBC who talked about some classes not fully reaching their intended goals in Classic and then just getting deferred to TBC.
---
I'm not crapping on Vanilla or trying to say TBC is better, but simply that TBC in so many ways *IS* Vanilla-like content. The only 2 major differences I can think of were smaller raids and flying.
---
So purely for min/maxing?
---
Started at release, no invite. Did sub again yesterday after a months break through.
---
Truthfully, it doesn't really mean anything for classic. There is a huge difference between watching someone play classic and playing classic. Obviously there is some interest there, Blizzard knows that, that's why they are remaking the game, but we all know what is going to happen when it launches. 
---
There will be a week or two of immense amounts of hype and a ton of players and then it will be start to die out, by the time we're a month to a month and a half in we will probably be at 20-25% of the starting population. That will likely be more than enough to have populated servers and a decent time, but it will not be overwhelmingly popular. Most of those people are going to quit because the game is slow, clunky, inconvenient and frustrating. But those of us that will be left, want that.
---
Everyone here is doing the exact opposite of the retail subreddit, they are overplaying the meaning of this.
---
So what I've gathered is you know exactly how layering is going to work, despite exactly zero people playing on a full realm with layering turned on. And also somehow barrens, famous for being an area that took FOREVER to level through, is not going to be a bottleneck for people after they breeze through the uncrowded Durotar/Mulgore in 2-3 hours of casual play...
---
Lmao, surely they can compare? Not 1:1 but very close. Besides, not even the vanilla relaunch will be a 1:1 copy of the original vanilla.
---
Proof that the grass is greener on the alliance side.
---
Nah man, it's because you aren't playing on a 17" or 19" CRT with 1280x1024 resolution.
---
It will pop up over the play button. Sam's of you add another wow account to your bnet account or a PTR account.
---
Y
---
Saywhatnow!!!
---
The game went to shit when they started listening to player feedback. Its always a big mistake giving random scrubs on a forum the power to change things.
---
only real answer
---
PepeLaugh
---
I would say Gnomer and maybe SM Lib. Rfk can definitely be done. In vanilla if mobs were 3-4 levels above you your tank will take some hard crushing blows.
---
When did you resub? I did that yesterday and pray now :(
---
im pretty sure he just hits HARD AF
---
Same here, the DAY it released.  I don't have an active sub tho.
---
Just having the option ruins the experience.
---
Do a search on this reddit for this and then delete the post, thanks.
---
Reread the comment he says ‚Äúmages get almost double the effect of not compared to other classes‚Äù. I can see the argument for that. Locks care more about spell power, priests care more about spirit. For mages its like all about int.
---
Imagine caring this much about a dude who is clearly having fun a game you wish you were playing
---
They will share location with blizzards current server because they‚Äôre using the same server infrastructure.
---
I don‚Äôt think any BGs are live right now so we can‚Äôt know for sure.
---
Yeah the myrmidons will crush the tank too quick making it unhealable  and then CC/slows will be resisted
---
I would think he's more looking for speed than danger. 
---
The guy is always the highest lvl on the server he doesn't have much to fear from opposite faction.
---
No warlock drinks after learning lifetap. No (good) warlock eats or bandages after learning drain life. Really, what downtime? Again, warlocks have ANTI-downtime; to recover, they kill MORE stuff.
---
"just not as many mobs" - yeah, that's kind of the whole point.
---
Memories of a wrong implementation of Classic.
---
Ah so it's easy then in real vanilla. I knew that it had to be bugged somehow!
---
You can remember a-holes by putting them on your ignore list or having some kind of addon that allows you to add notes to your friends-list.
---
You dont need an addon that share personal ratings with other players.
---
i hope it isnt only 2004/2005, i started my acc in january of 2006 D:
---
Collectors edition.
---
Do you plan to respec for pvp build and make horde testers have hard times?
---
Auction house after they moved it. It originally was around the corner.
---
As a vanilla rogue , I would have never traded to be a warrior. I out dpsd all of them, we never made it past 4 horsemen but I was consistently top dps in our guild. In pvp I wrecked warriors 1v1 it was all about spacing and dead zoning.
---
I‚Äôve yet to see anyone with an account creation date of 2006 get into the beta. Just what I‚Äôve seen reported form people that have gotten in though. Don‚Äôt take it as gospel.
---
Ramsey bolton: ‚Äúpork sausage‚Äù
---
you never gained do from bgs in vanilla
---
If that's what you take away from that stream, then Classic would never have suited you.
---
There's something I don't understand with spriest and dps warrior player.
---
You don't want to heal or tank, then why do you play a class that is the best healer or tank of the game and expect you'll be able to be a DPS ?
---
Fwiw I mained a warrior and a priest back in Vanilla.
---
So I have this problem with your data, and all data that shows DPS.
---
That top warrior there has a shit ton of damage per second, but was DPSing for what? 30 seconds less than the second place guy?
---
The second guy was more important to the raid.
---
Ohnonono we are losing, classicbros. This can't be happening. Our game will be dead in half a year and BFA will have 10M players. We have to play the pet battle and barbie dress-up simulator again again. What are we gonna do?!?!
---
I think lots of Aussie initially went to blackrock or something, it was a ya server but people just arbitrarily decided it would be unofficial Aussie server. I made my first character the week frostmourne opened. It was the first OCE realm. It‚Äôs server time was AEST and it was full of Aussies. It was hosted in the US though.
---
Haha yea.
---
The same people who want sharding want 420p graphics and no better lol as asmongold said if you want to play the game cause you‚Äôre obsessed with feeling like you‚Äôre in the past play it on a phone and enjoy your shit connection, bad graphics and horrible controls.
---
Yep, on my rogue I absolutely remember eating immediately after ganking warlocks and priests specifically to keep myself alive through the remainder of the dots I had on me.
---
Not an argument about why, but a lot of people were salty that streamers got in over them who had 'played since day one!!!'
---
No it doesn‚Äôt remain the same. It want part of the game then so it shouldn‚Äôt be part of it now.  You want that stuff stick with retail.
---
Love it!! I was afraid there'd be no wheater effects? Any videos on snow in Dun Morogh?
---
For phase 1, early 60's when people don't have their pre-bis it's BM + MM for sure, after it's MM + SV
---
Where is this picture taken from?
---
He does a shitton of damage on private servers too so idk
---
Why would you post this here ?
---
Stop spread misinformation, I have already made a post with video proof 
---
Regen is 100% like 2004.
---
Nope. That‚Äôs whack.
---
&gt; BRD vault keys off the auction house 
---
Why someone would sell it instead of opening the vault ? oO
---
Ty bro. Nice explanation.
---
What are your plans next? Are you going to focus the rest of the time on beta to find bugs, and perhaps level again with a slower pace while focusing on possible buggy details?
---
Yes of course 3 rogues 2 Druid Brd runs
---
I know I‚Äôm asking if they kept that feature like it used to be. I could see blizzard not thinking about it and keeping xp as it currently is.
---
This guy was shit talking classic so much when it was announced lmao
---
Layering will be loooooong gone by the time BG's are released, so that's a very moot point.
---
As long as they don't make it Classic-wide xrealm bgs and do battle groups of 3-4 servers to try and get a good 50/50 ratio between the servers they connect, I don't think itll be all that much of a problem. It'll still be a community, just a bigger one.
---
From what I gathered - mainly roleplayng. People want to be seen as they created their characters, faces, hair, beards, etc. vary wildly from older models to newer ones. There are no "ugly" faces on newer models, no dwarf "rape face", human female faces might as well be all the same, too many to count.
---
Can't you just change the gamma to make the game less bright?
---
Darn, I hope not as I was really looking forward to rolling a 19 rogue or hunter for WSG
---
It's not a contested zone.
---
You can play them at anytime so how is it memories? Memories from 5 minutes ago?
---
Can't wait for the "WAILING CAVERNS DEEP DIVE TIPS" video
---
Like what? Some miniscule changes to mob AI while leveling?
---
This has me seriously worried... No one in alpha or internal testing picked up on this? 
---
Classic is looking worse by the day.
---
Yeah, that's how it works in vanilla. BGs give zero XP.
---
I don‚Äôt think BGs will be coming into classic until phase 2
---
Think most we're 18 when the started it I think one was 19 and one was 20
---
past 1.8 all skills require at least 35+ to go past 225.
---
Gathering skills have no requirement until 225. Cooking and First-aid likewise don't have any requirement until 35 for their quest.
---
Fishing and primary production professions require 5, 10, 20, 35 for their respective ranks.
---
No, I don't know exactly how layering is going to work but there is only so much that they can do so that people can complete their quests. 2 hours is a solid time for 1-10, most people that will be playing will not be able to do it, I was speaking based on my own leveling speeds. Average will probably be around 3 hours, a lot of people will be slower then that.
---
So logically we are either getting dynamic respawns or starter-zone sharding ontop of the layering.
---
I'm partner. This is wrong :D
---
Why didnt you spec into Scorch when your Name is ... well skorch?
---
Hahahahahaahahahahahaha
---
Staysafe showed a video on his stream testing it in irvine you can check the VOD
---
&gt; Essentially, the only thing Rogue really excels at is open world PvP (to my knowledge).
---
AFAIK the rogue class was introduced to keep PvE servers well populated. Rogues don't need to have great DPS. As long as they allow players that are so inclined to get their kicks from ruining other people's fun, the rogue-class is fine.
---
And no, I'm not salty. I don't care. I avoid PvP so rogues don't bother me. If one tries to gank / frustrate me on a PvP server (most privates are), I switch to another char and shrug it off. *However*, it's notably rogues that are into this, I've witnessed as much. 
---
Luckily, a single rogue doesn't always win, either. It's when they team up on solo-levellers like me that I tell myself to let them have their fun while I change chars and play somewhere else.
---
Right now all they seem to be doing is inviting streamers and content creators (for exposure) and people with account creation dates of 2004/2005 (people that actually played vanilla).
---
You leveled 3 characters up 5 levels congratulations. It‚Äôs more then just clicking a box. It‚Äôs pretty much just been content creators and accounts with active subscriptions that played in vanilla. 
---
Why would they send newer accounts invites?
---
Dude, for random 5-man PUGs even SFK can be difficult.
---
I know. Just wanted to verify that blizzard didn‚Äôt look that part over as I haven‚Äôt seen anything of the beta.
---
That would be a pretty gamebreaking move, I haven‚Äôt played the beta but I‚Äôm 99.9% sure they would never do that.
---
Classic will generally be more easy than Pservers, due to less scripting errors and bugs.
---
Please don't use that as an insult for idiots. There are many of us with autism who actually contribute to this game.
---
Its just a wipe guys, chill lol
---
It doesn't, 40 dmg per proc
---
How did they even get through darnassus?
---
I assume we're prob going to get downvoted, but I fully agree with you.  Also, this is going to get real old real fast with people throwing around World First, etc etc...on 15 year old content lol
---
&gt; but we *do* know that it doesn't work like *that*.
---
His idea makes sense actually.
---
It would be very easy for them to make a fixed layer (where players can never move out of it) and see where it goes. At the end of phase 1 they can choose to transfer the layer on a dedicated RP-PVP server or merge it with the standard PVP server.
---
Playing games for a living sure sounds fun but I've also thought about the side effects. Of course these are all personal and might not be a problem for everyone but for me it might affect the hobby side of gaming. You know if I'd be a popular streamer playing some games offline and something ridiculous happens I'd be like "damn I should've streamed this".
---
Some gamers have stopped gaming during their freetime after making it their job like Markiplier.
---
5 Hours slower than Joanas 1-30 in his record run. Joana took 24hrs, 19m. Very strange
---
If it was a Hunter or Lock, I would say Combat Dagger/Backstab spec for sure. With a priest, it is pretty close I think. He could range pull multiple mobs together, and you can backstab them one by one.
---
Notably, only one of you can get the last hit. So Remorseless Attacks might be less good than usual, since your friend should get most kills for Spirit Tap.
---
And still they failed because they aim to be authentic making up stuff like dmg or armor or how mechanics works ( warlock pet summoning mechanics )
---
People on PServer are trying to give feedback for Classic with wrong information, like the regen clownfiest debunked
---
i FoRgOt tO GeT WaTeR
---
you a good dude mate
---
Well thats an interesting thought. If vanilla WoW were perfect, Id agree. But it wasnt. Certain changes could make classic better than it ever was. I dont look back at '05 and '06 as flawless gaming, just a better game than retail is now.
---
Best in slot*
---
stonetalon is a contested zone
---
Can we be friends?
---
(p.s. I'm an American who voted for Obama)
---
You have a friend list and an ignore list. Why do you need more than that?
---
if anything all he does is to steal someone elses argument and pose it as his own, and remember he cant be wrong unless the universe mixes it up and not him. also apparently he is a "vanilla veteran from hardcore guilds" but has 0 game knowledge about actuall vanilla and just comes off as a shady cars dealer..
---
Don't you guys have glasses ?
---
Firey enchant does 40 damage a proc, at 7 PPM (I think?) it‚Äôs not affected by +spell damage
---
Imagine the fact that I laughed my ass off the whole time. I am having fun. Are you trying to imply that since I don‚Äôt have access to the beta I should respect the people who do? My first time ever on twitch and I laughed oh so heartily. Had a great time. Dude is going to be a memelord.
---
This is very interesting, thank you!  
---
My account was created august 26th 2006. What a coincident :D
---
I think it prioritize people that plays alot of ptr and are known to report a lot of bugs. As much as I would like to play beta i havent done any of that.
---
I like it
---
we want to be seen by everyone as we see/created ourselves. i chose to give my character THAT face, THAT hair, etc. not that grotesque abomination of a reworked retail insult, you dont like how im looking? too bad, im an ugly old fuck in rl i want to be an ugly old fuck in wow
---
I'll never forget invasion ethics in Demon's Souls. Best thing about that game was invading and waiting for the other player to finish whatever they were doing, heal up, and bow to signal both parties are ready. It's been nice to see it carry over to the later games, but it's definitely not at the same level as it was in that game.
---
The pot literally didn't matter considering he didn't hit him anymore after he used it. The only hit that went through afterwards was a dodge.
---
 10/11/2006N/A14-day Guest Pass was my start date
---
I‚Äôve always thought the undead ghosts were really sad. Like the mans died twice give him a break.
---
Shadowfang for 19 twinks. Instant bread winner.
---
Just play dude. Even the most experienced players need atleast 110-120 hours for 1-60. You'll figure things out along the road.
---
Hi, I started in late 2005. Got WoW for my 12th birthday. I am turning 26 this year, and am working on my masters degree. Didn't go directly to uni after high school, took two years "off" between.
---
LOL
---
That is simply wrong and very ignorant. And if it was true ‚Äúknow what it is‚Äù means nothing. If you are born too late for wow‚Äôs glory days you will probably not have any special connection to it.
---
Did you really play the game in 640x480? Wow. I used 1024x768 or 1280x1024.
---
you'd think someone who is paid to play video games would be good at them.
---
Idk, new models in old texture enviroment and gear are going to look like an eyesore. This suggestion is floating here since day 1. I don't really mind either way but it's very unlikely. Most of the max settings actually WERE even in vanilla, it's just that they were way too much for HW at the time and were hidden in UI but accessible through console commands.
---
yeah, i mean there's no actual impact on gameplay, it's just the scrolling combat text is off by a factor of 10.
---
I agree, just never know plus it‚Äôs the beta so they could‚Äôve forgot and a beta player will point it out.
---
Making level 19 and 39 twinks was some of the best pvp in classic for me.
---
Sunder Armor is a physical debuff, Faerie Fire a magical debuff, and CoR a curse, so they should all stack.
---
Sunder Armor and Expose Armor are both physical, so they do not stack.
---
Even if it's contested it still mean more ressource. 
---
And i'm sure we will not be alone doing it, i mean there is no way all the private server (and retail ?) guilds that will roll together on the same server will not exploit this if it benefit them.
---
dude wtf is your aspect ratio
---
little bit of column a, little bit of column b
---
Glad someone shares my view on him. I'm sick of seeing people sucking up to him.
---
Awesome, thanks for the clarification
---
&lt;--- levels prot every time, cries inside, gets lots of PMs
---
Yes but it is far more successful than only memory of 15 years ago. The people who only use memory instead of evidence are far more wrong than anyone else, and would make worst bug reporter.
---
Max lvl for the demo was 19.
---
Druids get a quest to go to moonglade at lvl 10 for bear form. They can teleport there.
---
Cool, thanks for the clarification!
---
Good to know it‚Äôs a flat rate before I try to meme or something
---
started playing in 2005 at seven years old, am graduating college next spring
---
Maybe, Hunters are tough if they get the jump. But it's not like a good rogue can't handle a hunter.
---
My bad I was thinking of Redridge !
---
You realise a server may never actually be five layers? And that for most players layering will be gone by the time they're even thinking about devilsaur stuff? And even then, you have no idea how easy/hard it will be to switch layers.
---
It's just baseless speculation.
---
With the first stress test mid week next week, they‚Äôre definitely going to be inviting more. I foresee more daily invites.
---
Nope. I hate gambling and I hate paying money for a chance. As much as I love vanilla WoW, I'm not going to subscribe.
---
LFG VC
---
I‚Äôm also pretty sure that if your playing a dual weapon class and you have firey on both you still get the same number of procs. Not 100% sure about that one though.
---
Level 30 with a game length of 1.25 days? God damn, I hope I'm as fast as you.
---
Yes, and your slight ms bonuses from 20 to 40 will be quickly outshined by my wildly more efficient and rapid grinding from 14-60 plus no corpse runs from 18-60, all of which require a lot more XP than your slight advantage from 20-40. See how that works?
---
Plus, warlocks are 3rd on an arbitrary chart made by people parroting common misconceptions about the overall advantage of movement buffs. 3rd on a chart. First in reality. That's what this whole debate is about.
---
It's not like Druid is slow, though. It's probably third or fourth in practice (they're on about the same level as dedicated levelling-build AoE mages and maybe shaman for 1-60 powerleveling)
---
Same, ive tanked him with a shaman., even.
---
What's so strange about it? Joana did highly optimised runs on Horde as a hunter. This is a mage on Alliance.
---
https://youtu.be/TvmvPE3toOw
---
This is from Athens‚Äôs perspective. I couldn‚Äôt find tips‚Äô though so take it with a grain of salt.
---
its pretty weak sauce they should at least give people with an active sub tuat dont own bfa a shot
---
what do you think that sub is for? so i can queue for lfr that never fills or grind shitty legendaries lol
---
Ohhh this is in moonglade!
---
For some reason I thought I was in teldrasil.
---
Yep, but I didn‚Äôt buy the demo. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm justifying it lol
---
then they would see it when they went to that sub. The only people seeing this because of your post are people who only visit this sub.
---
If they did look over it, it would be fixed fairly quickly.
---
Warriors are top dog dps through all of Vanilla.
---
If you want to RP, choose an RP-realm. If you don't, choose a non-RP-realm.
---
Devs have hinted at possibly introducing realm transfers (for money) at a later point in time. If they don't, you can simply start a fresh character on the new realm.
---
It's always been easy to make friends in-game, but it's even easier before cross-realm grouping and especially CRZ took off. If your IRL friends can't or don't want to play you won't have difficulty making in-game friends.
---
29 hours to 30 seems slow compared to pservers, do you think you could do better on classic?
---
1. Because my character's aesthetics should not be dependent on other players' graphics settings. This rules out a local toggle affecting all characters.
---
2. Because the game should present a unified aesthetic, not a mish-mash of old world geometry and new character models that clash aesthetically. This rules out a server-side toggle affecting all players' view of your character.
---
3. Because WoW Classic should preserve the original WoW for historical conservation purposes, as Vanilla WoW is one of the most influential games of all time. For this reason, media representation of the game should use on the original aesthetics of the game, which would be near impossible to enforce in the social media age if new models were available.
---
4. Because character visibility (or lack thereof) is actually an important detail for PvP, especially avoiding gankers in the open world by hiding in water/bushes/shadows. Modern character models, textures and animations stand out more from the terrain, especially against classic terrain and textures.
---
5. Because NPCs and PCs should generally use the same models to facilitate roleplay and improve immersion, and many NPCs and humanoid mobs around old Azeroth do not have a modern equivalent. This means that implementing an effective model swap option would actually require significant development time, and isn't just something the devs can turn on at a whim.
---
I have money, so yes it was the best.
---
U stoopid. U can buy a 2mo game card for 20$ online ...
---
To add to this would you be willing to share the build you used?
---
hE's lUcKy i DoNt HaVe DaSh
---
gets me every time
---
There are plenty of guides, but I would strongly urge you to start your experience without knowing anything, and learning on the way. 
---
That's the experience a lot of us that played back then wish we could have again, so or seems crazy to have the chance to get it, and ruin it just to be competitive. 
---
Exploring Azeroth for the first time is a very special thing, don't miss out on it ;)
---
2 hours and he hasn't answered any questions. I think it's safe to say he passed out. lol
---
For me it‚Äôs a moot point anyway since I‚Äôm looking mostly at classes that don‚Äôt dual wield, but for what it‚Äôs worth, I do think you are right.
---
I‚Äôm curious though how/if increasing attack amount/attack speed affects the PPM.
---
Hey Lahey, knock knock.   
---
Who's there, Rick?

Mr Stupidy Head that's fucking pissing me off right now, thinks he's a captain of the shit-liner and by the way your fish sticks suck, so fuck off, open the gate!
---
Yeah and your imago and rep is everything. One thing that basicly you said or did can screw up your career in a hearthbeat.
---
yeah they have seperate teams and are both updated frequently
---
You must be trolling
---
Why? It's great to just sit at home playing games and going outside being in the fresh air whenever you feel like it.
---
I wish they could, but TBC would be inherently broken without it. The whole zone is basically designed to fly/platform to many of the areas. It'd take a total redo of Outlands.
---
I like that this sort of content is drawing so much attention, I don't like that it's Asmongold
---
This mafucka right here.
---
Which is why I think it works for the ah shit.
---
You probably don't care about community but some do.
---
CRBG are the first step of what make retail a shitty solo game where nobody talks to each other.
---
I don't want to be in a BG with &lt;Server 3&gt;Warbob and &lt;Server 2&gt;Dankhealz that I'll probably never meet again.
---
I want to play with Hunterino that always crack jokes at the start of the BG and insult us when we loose, against Demonia the warlock that always kill me but one day I'll get her etc ...
---
Frig off berb.
---
Could you make it 1440p as well?
---
And if you don't choose to see new models, your experience is plain vanilla. So what's the issue?
---
Different people are interested in vanilla for different reasons. Some long for the most accurate vanilla experience possible, some simply want to play a more complex game with skill trees and such. 
---
It would be a purely client-side change that doesn't affect other players - why does it bother you? Are you bothered by the fact that other players can switch to the new water rendering? Or increase foliage over what was in vanilla? If they set their clients to such settings, how is your enjoyment of the game impaired?
---
he played to lvl 50 but unless you have played on pservers that experience is completely useless unless you have eidetic memory or something
---
I‚Äôm assuming they mean literally simultaneously (as in in both games running at the same time).
---
There is no problems with new features as long as they don't effect the core principles. For example the Orgimmar area could easily be turned into a free-for all pvp area, maybe even with betting akin to the Dualing Arena in OSRS. No balancing changes made, no focus on it, just something tucked away for anyone who wants to use it.
---
Well, to be fair, this directly changes gameplay. To much, much lesser degree, but in the same sense LFD does. 
---
Before, you had to interact with the target personally via chat, now the game gives you a GUI option to skip that.
---
No the PPM on most things like that are fixed.
---
Jesus christ rogue does too much damage
---
Gnomes are hilarious.
---
zoomerspeak
---
Why not give him a walking animation like the original one?
---
They flat out stated in an interview that they decided upon the older system because it felt more appropriate for classic as it had been around for the bulk of vanilla. The same logic would apply to an argument as to why cross-server BGs should not be implemented.
---
I apologize if I was not clear in my initial response; I am merely applying their rationalization regarding the mount system to cross-server BG's.
---
literally who
---
Hotfix got pushed to CDN with the command
---
    sudo git -gud
---
I've been playing vanilla off and on for six years.  It's all I've ever wanted.
---
It bothers me because it wasn‚Äôt in vanilla, if it want in vanilla it won‚Äôt be in classic. It‚Äôs not up for debate. It‚Äôs already been decided.
---
Yea July '06 noob here, nothing yet. I haven't had great luck getting into betas with Blizz though. Not a big deal. As a software dev, my interest in QAing for other products is not high. :) Do enough of that day to day.
---
Bummer. Would be fun to try and push it upwards even if it wasn‚Äôt optimal just for the sake of laughs
---
Was in high school in 04, in masters program in 19. I struggle a bit.
---
I mean, I don't want to get into a while thing here, but it's massively hard not to get the jump as a hunter between track humanoids, track stealthed, flare and traps. It's going to be harder pre phase 2 because of the lack of insignia, but even then, hunters definitely have the upper hand in that matchup. Not saying it's unwinnable for a rogue, but it's certainly an uphill battle.
---
If you've never played Vanilla, know this:
---
A rogue can literally 1-2 shot you with a CS-&gt;KS cold blood evis combo while your healer is sapped. If its a 1v1, you will be stunlocked 80% of the time against a good rogue with prep. 
---
The rotation is this:
---
cs-&gt; (4s)
---
ks-&gt; (6s)  
---
blind-&gt;(10s, if they trinket, pop all your cds and then vanish if things are getting bad. save sprint to reset)  
---
re-engage now that trinket is gone (assuming they trinketed blind)  
---
cs-&gt; 4s  
---
ks-&gt; 6s  
---
blind (you used prep)-&gt; 10s  
---
restealth, sap 10s
---
sap 5s
---
sap 2s (you're waiting for DRs on cs ks to reduce to 0)
---
improved gouge-&gt; 5.5s  
---
restealth, sap, repeat.
---
Total time cc'd: 60+s where the rogue is attacking you and you cant attack back. The only way to survive is get a lucky DoT/vanish break on the rogue or prevent him from stealthing some how. 
---
Warriors can prevent some of the saps with their stances, but its still inefficient. They will always lose unless they are completely geared to the teeth.  The key with warriors is to bait a trinket and then get a restealth. Do this without using a blind. To do this, you basically have to make him trinket a kidney or bait him with a gouge. E.g after the kidney do a gouge instead of a blind.  
---
The only classes that you cannot efficiently do this on are warlocks and hunters, for which the first part of the rotation you must kill their pets while the masters are stunlocked.
---
popping adderal to level in WoW. MmKay
---
Sword drawn was supposed to be a more combat aspect to the fact people are going to die a lot in classic, at least, that was my idea. I'm still new to memeing (I also have autism) and struggle to convey concepts correctly.
---
OMG I had totally forgot too, I was like "haha, yea that's where the auction house is in retail, in vanilla it is... wait a minute, where was it now again?" but it was, as you say, in the corner of the little square to the right!
---
Well that boss is but you DO need to tank or spank or heal :p
---
Was this ever clipped at any point? I wanna see it
---
No, it should be randoms and streamers like it is.
---
It‚Äôs one of those cringe things twitch users say
---
Just wait til you see the meta this time around. Threat will be the only limiting factor when you don't have 15-20 numbskulls being carried each raid.
---
I'd guess probably not unless they add it back for the sake of #nochange.
---
And we won't be able to test it in the beta since the max lvl for a player is 30.
---
Remember we'll have a completely new client, so the code that "cleans" the mobs abilities when they're tamed is completely new and probably not buggy like the one from 1.12 client that lets Blind Hunter keeps is CC immune.
---
I'm really concered they nerf the content because they don't even try to take the game serious :(
---
I think it's awesome if i need 1-2-3 trys to kill a 5 man dungeon boss. What's the deal if i can oneshot everything?
---
Tips played in vanilla, stop trying to spread lies. Also you can't expect someone to remember every single detail of original vanilla after over a decade of not playing that version of the game outside of PServers. After playing on PServers for so long the details get mixed up. You act like you know more when you likely would do the same thing.
---
saving this for later cheers
---
We can‚Äôt say anything for sure right now.
---
All we know for fact is that at this moment in time if your not a streamer/content creator or someone with an account t creation date of 2004/2005 you basically won‚Äôt get an invite.
---
How ever I‚Äôm sure they are planning to let more people in as time goes on. Especially for the stress test dates given on the announcement post on Wednesday.
---
His meme generation quality makes up for it.
---
I literally only heard about him yesterday.
---
Understood, but wouldn‚Äôt you just spam invite in earlier days? That‚Äôs what I remember. That is by all means driven by the same outcome - let some know that you want to join the group. Written Interactions weren‚Äôt exclusively necessary and more ‚Äútime consuming‚Äù. Especially if it was about tapping a mob that has low hp
---
Yeah well at 19 I didn't need much talking into to do drugs.  Lot has changed in 15 years.
---
He knew the hunter was Beast Master spec.
---
Dude I am just saying people who played vanilla when it was actual are veterans. plPeople who played on pservers for the past few years aren't veterans. Yea they know maybe more bcs that is the only version they played, but aren't veterans.
---
You don't lose the damage outright, but you lose the ability to outright press a button and wham you get crit, on average you'll still probably be critted once per encounter but it's now no longer a guarantee.
---
Personally way I see it up to 20-30 if you level alone you likely want to level as 2h fury since the early fury talents are better for leveling and give straight up more stuff. After that arms is just better. With a 2h weapon anger management will be better than unbridled wrath at generating rage, axe spec gives as much crit as crueltydoes but after 40 you can take the fury crit too so it's definitely better (assuming you keep using axes but with ww axe it's worth having initially). Sweeping strikes is super strong and until you really start stacking ap and strength at 60 mortal strike is much better than bloodthirst. You only really miss out on enrage and flurry but with a 2h and no crit-gear flurry will be much less worth than it will at 60 and imo probably slightly worse than deep wounds/impale. I'm going arms straight away because I'm lazy.
---
They removed lock mana and life tap in bfa
---
How is a toggle that only affects what the player sees count as a change for you? If I toggle on HD models and you don't, you do not see HD models.
---
u mean the 1 clip where he didnt trigger the trap he ran over, or the one where a 27 hunter came and killed me
---
lmao that boss took him from 95% to dead in 4 seconds.
---
Probably just an unlucky crit and no reason to report, but I can also see why someone would think that something ain't right there.
---
But that's just not factually accurate. 
---
Colorblind settings are in that were not in classic. Graphics settings are in that were not in classic. Macros that worked in vanilla will most likely not (all) work in classic. 
---
Blizzard is trying to make it possible to have the most authentic experience achievable that can be created on modern technology. But they are not giving you 1.12 as it was. There are even slight differences in how it looks that *cannot* be toggled (lighting for example can only be recreated 99% in the modern engine). Why would the mere existence of something that you can switch off bother you? Nobody gains an advantage or even gameplay *difference* from having other models than you are. 
---
It's like trying to force a 4:3 aspect ratio onto everyone because that's what vanilla was played at back in the day.
---
I knew they spent a while doing it but I didn‚Äôt think it was 9hours. I really hope they didn‚Äôt.
---
Asmongold and esfand cleared deadmines with out wiping.
---
yea
---
Depends on how you define QoL, I suppose. If it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù it makes sense. If it‚Äôs ‚Äúbeing able to swap character positions on the selection list‚Äù, not so much.
---
Is aoe leveling still viable with the different pathing?
---
I'll try to find out but I don't know anyone else to help me test stun mechanics yet.
---
So what ? Why only use half of your toolkit ?
---
And anyway you can beat all the raids of the game without any warrior dps.
---
But you can't do it without any warrior tank.
---
Warriors are tank first dps second.
---
Because it wasn‚Äôt in classic.
---
Doesn't appear to be but it's hard to tell since it changes doesn't it?
---
Joana said on his stream he thinks Classic hunter should be right around 22 hours for speed leveling 1-30. Interesting how much faster hunter might be. I also don't think Skorch was super optimized about it he just seemed genuinely casual and leveling at a fast but relaxed pace. (didn't talk to him personally just what I could gather from the few tid-bits of conversation here and there on various streams)
---
You're wanking about classicwow in a classicwow sub, it's circlejerking in it's core concept
---
Same story here, never got into any other betas
---
deadmines took esfand and asmongold over 1 hour not including the time clearing the cave to zone in
---
Nothing I've seen is actually game-breaking. Just several tiny annoying bugs like autoattacking with hunters.
---
Yes, but I quit subbing a month ago :p Guess it's back to play retail with GF until beta.
---
42 with two kids, I'm making time. It won't be as *much* time as I had back in college, but it'll be there. You won't be alone. I'm sure the "weekend warriors" type guilds will make up a large part of the game, this time.
---
I think they should prioritize peope who like licorice. Suggesting for a friend.
---
I started mine 2004 and played at EU launch, did not receive beta yet.
---
I had to do that since I was 15. Must be nice.
---
No different to watching football or any other sport
---
I'm quite sure you don't need BFA for classic beta
---
They are not going to nerf a bunch of bosses because one streamer got killed.
---
Those guilds will have loads of people running around in pvp specs because they will be farming for rank 14 outside of raid times. Same goes for fighting over world bosses and harassing guilds on the other faction (Killing them and fucking up their world buffs).
---
They will be geared to the teeth and with full knowledge. Doesn't matter if the specc is not optimal for PvE dps other than during first progress.
---
Lupos used to ignore armour by doing Shadow Damage.
---
Yeah but people automatically assume that the content will be trivial for everyone due to simple mechanics. And when they think that, the referenced video shows how it ends up...
---
Not saying it's not tank and spank. I'm saying it's not necessarily easy!
---
I'm considering between Mage and Priest currently. My main concern with Mage is not being able to find groups, apart from that i would definitely prefer it over Priest. Obviously its a small sample size in the beta, but what are your thoughts on this?
---
It works!!!!!
---
Can't wait to corpserun the entire frigging 15 minutes back through that place after getting wiped by Verdan!
---
Holy cringe, Batman. 
---
He must be knew to the Internet.
---
Or where he 1v1 killed you on the dock and then must have been what another 3 or 4 times after that when he back to questing and you kept trying to stream snipe him.
---
i had wow tokens from back when they were 40k
---
but i dont think its really worth buying a sub on a pretty new account just in the hope of access
---
im pretty sure they will open up access a bit more at some point
---
Now all the streamers can show us their big dick DPS.
---
Did you make this years ago and finally find a place it was relevant or did you somehow stumble across this weirdly specific video?
---
I mean I'm with you, but if we were to talk about some hypothetical "honour" law or whatever then I would see why someone would think its acceptable to pot when you're ambushed at low health but not when you're the aggressor who already had an advantage.
---
I'm just stating an opinion that's pretty reasonably supported. I mean, do you disagree with anything I said? Do you believe that WoW classic is not quickly overtaking BfA in most measures of popularity (reader counters, stream views, youtube views, etc)? Do you think Classic will not be more popular when it gets closer to the release date? Do you not think Classic and Classic content will get even more popular after release?
---
I don't think trying to have a reasonable discussion about something is "wanking off", for example, I think Classic will overtake retail in all measures of popularity and engagement for at least a few months, but I don't think Classic will be anywhere near as popular as Fortnite was or is.
---
Mine is the same actually... I swear I checked it last year and saw it. 
---
If you still have access to your old email used for blizz, you can search for transaction receipts.
---
That is odd, rogues were the most popular iirc. I knew locks would be low though.
---
Streaming isn't a career and they haven't earned anything. They just happened to be at the right place on the right time. You wouldn't be calling someone who won the lottery as someone who earned that money.
---
The healer was damn awful. Jumping around, slacking.
---
the best is when you throw 30sp on a low level item for leveling casters
---
though that came from some raid so we wont have it phase 1
---
Clearly a hunter weapon.
---
Lol. You only need 1 proper MT for most bosses with a feral/fury warr (with tank gear equipped) handling the rest.
---
The same reason a dozen of the most popular addons exist,  because I want it to operate different than retail.
---
From the reports ive seen from people getting invited it looks like no EU guys have got invited yet.
---
This guy is incredibly arrogant and annoying.
---
I'm actually all for an optional graphical update/remaster, but I'm not wild about the time it would take or the problems the retail toggle had for those who wanted to use the old models. If a solution could be found that fixes the toggle, or makes it a separate optional patch to install, there's still the concern that unless the colors, contrast, patterns, etc are extremely similar to vanilla, we run into issues where there could be PvP advantages to those using one graphical setting over another. Seeing people under the new water vs the old water could be an example of this.
---
No I get all that, but I just place all those memories more with world PvP, not BGs. My social bonds were made with guild mates and my nemeses were made out in the "field". BGs were more casual to me, and I dont mind sacrificing familiarity there for fast que times.
---
Lmao ight bro
---
Actually you were killed by Unknown.
---
Old school wailing caverns was a nightmare but 9 hours is crazy
---
His chat has been compiling bugs he's encountered, and he says he's planning on doing a VoD analysis stream to report all the bugs at once instead of sending a million little  tickets along the way.
---
i mean essentially anyone who is subbed and does not own bfa should just get access.
---
like its pretty clear what they are subbed for and seems a bit mean to cost people only interested in classic sub time for no game
---
I didn't see looking for group until I was already a man, and then all it did was blind me.
---
It's almost like you're ignoring the video I posted as the image better suits your narrative. Well, here's another one anyways: 
---
https://youtu.be/8lKFNczM-wY?t=932
---
i never played vanilla myself during its period.
---
was afraid it will get me hooked since i was a huge fan of RPG games. i knew myself then...i think i was around 17.
---
i was sincerely afraid i will get hooked. 
---
later on during life i tried it on private server and all those fears were justified. i had a great experience. after signing off petition for official classic server on nostalrius and saying goodbye to my lvl 40 char. i am finally be able to experience that which i never have.
---
There was a clip, but cant find it, probably got delete, anyway you can find it on the original video, on this time 02:20:50, hour 2, minute 20, seconds 50.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425347552
---
Doesn't matter that we don't like it, Diablo immortal will most likely make alot of money for a rather small production cost.
---
Pepe.... An alt right emote? PepeLaugh what a fucking boomer
---
Oh no need to apologize. I thank you for the response greatly.  Just really wanted to hear more of your thoughts.
---
In any MMORPG there will always been a full cast of guilds looking to do content in different ways with different levels of dedication. I am definitely not dissuaded.  Just taking the time to query a lot of different people and figure out just what I actually want to try doing, haha.
---
Definitely never got passed level 30 or so growing up, so looking forward to actually doing things this time around.
---
It's not that, totems have an aura associated with them that literally pulses in a radius every few hundred miliseconds applying their buff to any players/units that meet the criteria. If you manage to enter that radius just after the pulse, you'll have to wait until the next pulse til you receive the buff.
---
The amount of people saying the everliving does too much damage is too high. I very strictly remember that big bitch oneshotting our tanks.
---
Too bad it's not Skada/Details rip :(
---
&gt; I'm just stating an opinion that's pretty reasonably supported 
---
You're implying classicwow is more popular based on first day of beta play compared to retail current status on the sub about classicwow. I simply replied that this is criclejerking. preaching to the choir and all that. Doesn't mean I agree or disagree with anything said.
---
Pretty sure that's the World of Warcraft Bestiary by BradyGames
---
Dont mind them they dont last. Then its real job time
---
Hard with a streaming resume.
---
The 1v1 was cuz I was testing out trap lol. He ran right over it.
---
Make sure to open a report for every new grass or bush you see as well. /s
---
Horde version too, please !
---
I'm hopping they will split it, so that people who want vanilla only can stay that way (i'm not one but i've seen a surprising amount). I think progressive servers would be interesting/fun, like hey if you're 58/60 you can transfer to this server that's going to go into TBC, while letting the people who only want to do vanilla stay on that server, the new TBC server would also let people make fresh level 1's as well.
---
I have 20 IRL friends and acquaintances who haven't played retail wow since atleast WotLK, who don't frequent this sub and don't watch streamers. They are all coming back for classic... I think a lot of returning people are still under the radar.
---
Bitch I'm still playing Diablo 2, ill play that and classic forever.
---
Jesus fuck that guys needs to fix his fucking mic.
---
? Oh you must be in EU. Was  November '04 in NA.
---
Oh, no EU yet at all? That's a bit comfy actually. But still sad if that is true since Blizzard keeps prioritizing US over EU in everything =(
---
Why do you want them? they feel so out of place for vanilla. Doesn't make sense..
---
Trying to speed level is also helpful to devs. These people are trying to exploit and take full advantage of the games' systems. Pushing these to the limit certainly has value.
---
I saw a german streamer that got an invite, there were not many people there though. Like 45 at alliance total.
---
I'm February 2006, so I hope that I might get accepted into the next wave!
---
https://i.imgur.com/Irga3mM.png
---
I was there within 3 weeks of release 2004. So many memories, coming from UO/EQ, WoW blew my mind!
---
Oh, well. Honestly. I'd rather see they do what they're doing now. Mostly everyone who get in is either media / news or old school players. That's fine, even if I'm one my self I'm ok with not getting it yet.
---
I'm quite sure the stress tests will be open for a lot of people, especially the last one.
---
They don't need to stress the servers, they need a few people to test stuff.
---
This is the correct answer.  I watched closely to XP drops on a couple streams early on and their XP drops were lining up to some spreadsheets that I found a couple weeks back.
---
[Here are the spreadsheets in question](https://imgur.com/a/QoWrn).
---
Are the levels wiped on release?
---
Again this is just what I‚Äôve noticed form everyone saying they‚Äôve got it. 
---
So far seems to be streamers/content creators, or NA accounts created in 2004/2005.
---
Dude no they are clipped at different time intervals lol just check the vod it took them about 2 hours.
---
You dont even have the slightest clue. Asmongold is a huge classic enthusiast &amp; trashes bfa.
---
The whole point of layering is to massively overload the population cap initially, so a sufficient population remains a month in. So there might very well be much more than five layers, depending if they use sharing in the starter zones during the first days or not.
---
Switching layers needs to be somewhat easy. Imagine joining the same server with your friend, and being unable to group up for Hogger.
---
No one has any idea on how long layering might be in the game. Assuming it's gone by the second week tops is just as baseless.
---
RemindMe! 6 months
---
You seem fun
---
As much as I agree that it was funny he reported after getting one shot by that WC boss, I think the hate circlejerk here is really unwarranted. The guy is creating content for Classic and I presume wants it to succeed as much as we do. The hate here is really accomplishing nothing and is just vile and baseless.
---
Just calm the hell down. As long as Blizz does not nerf that boss after his report I am okay with how he chooses to spend his time in Classic Beta.
---
I hope someone slaps together a tl;dw version on YouTube. That shit would be good.
---
Because people are fucking stupid and have stupid opinions about things that don't affect them.
---
It's not I miss, ffs, it's I BLESS
---
are there zone invisible walls
---
People are downvoting me like crazy. :)
---
Let me elaborate.
---
Graphics is drawn by the client (the wow.exe you run on your machine). The server only tells the client what time it is (hour, minute). The client selects the appropriate lighting and draws the scene. So when Vanilla was current what you've seen on your screen as "night time" was drawn by the Vanilla client running at the time. Which was the 1.12.1 client before TBC.
---
Private servers (mostly) emulate 1.12 and to play on them you need to run the exact same 1.12.1 Vanilla wow.exe. So what you can see right now regarding the lighting if you log on to a pserver is *exactly* the same as you could see playing Vanilla WoW.
---
Sometime in the beginning of Vanilla (perhaps even just the beta) nights were indeed darker. But it was quickly changed. For the majority of Vanilla's existence nights weren't *that* dark. Sometime much later Blizzard changed night time again (in Cata? don't know) and it was brighter. But then they changed it back. Modern WoW is just as dark as Vanilla. But in any case Classic is not emulating either Cata or modern but Vanilla. And you can check running the original Vanilla client that indeed, Classic night is just as dark as Vanilla night.

Kresh can also drop a blue shield
---
iirc mages can't really aoe level until 28 or so
---
It took like 2-3 hours or something, I watched the whole thing
---
It's a pve server you. Clueless people like you who report things that are working as intended shouldn't have access to beta.
---
I've never watched a stream until last night when he was leveling with Esfand. It was pretty entertaining. But goddamn if I don't understand the Twitch-speak in the chat room. The the hell does "Pog" mean? Every second someone was saying that
---
Locks and druids are always the lowest on pservers from what I recall, makes sense too.
---
Verdan was no joke, I remember healing that on my shaman and I had to use everything plus my tank had to kite.
---
*autistic screeching intensifies*
---
It wasn‚Äòt 9 hours, but defenitely 2. at The last boss, Tipsout died at The last adds and that caused a huge delay because he got in, pulled a random mob and died again. Then again in and couldn‚Äòt find the way to the boss. Then they wiped at the last boss. 
---
And all that running costs so much time. But it was very vanilla like, i‚Äòve seen myself be in a group like that
---
No, you seem fun. People like you are the reason WoW is like it is today. 
---
If you truly want no changes you're a fucking dumbass, kill your self. FYI: We had a good game and it's fucking gone and it's never going to come back with this shit fuck dumbass ideology.
---
You should be pushing for new content not recreating the shitstorm of old.

Are you using 16:9 aspect ratio? If you put the Alignment setting to "cover" in the wallpaper engine setting it looks ok doesn't it? You will loose some of the sides, or else I could make it with black bars bottom and top to maintain the entire picture inside a 16:9 ratio.

bc was actually better than vanilla in like every way
---
I think there is a marked difference between things performance-related things like resolution and framerate, and aesthetic things like textures, models, animations, and effects. Increasing the resolution or playing at 144Hz does not change the aesthetic of the game. Changing the water shader or using updated character models and animations changes the aesthetic of the game.

You get 3/3 improved blizzard at 24 and can do it before this if you're careful, even at 14 with arcane explosion to a lesser extent

If you're going to use layering then you're writing lasagna code

We're talking about people who actually get a lot of consistent viewers, not "partners" that dont pass 50 viewers and somehow got partner

Man recount is the authentic experience

we can add LFR, as long as you don‚Äôt use it your vanilla experience remains unchanged

See how that doesn‚Äôt work?

Vanilla Veteran here too. Played a warrior from 1 to 35 and got my whirlwind axe after a LOT of effort and asking for help in LFG in stormwind.  
---
Then my dad asked me to level his Shaman, which I did from 10 to 60, and dabbled in PvP and raid Healing on the shaman and his Druid in Naxx for a bit while he took naps.  
---
Fuck I miss vanilla.

More viewers than subs on here.
---
You literally started with, "No, you..." and unironically to boot! That's...almost wholesome? I mean you ruined it with every sentence after that. I use the loosest possible definition of sentence.
---
Warcraft 3 Reforged got all new models, textures, animations, cinematics (at least the intro :), etc. It has been thoroughly reworked and looks nothing like the original.
---
Classic WoW uses Vanilla art assets (the mentioned models, textures, animations, effects, etc.). It uses the modern engine so there a few "freebies", like modern shadows, water, increased ground clutter distance being the main ones. These are optional and the graphics options let you set them. But it's still basically the original game (just like adding an "SSAO" option to Warcraft 3 wouldn't make it "Reforged").
---
why is everybody shittalking tips? has anyone seen the clip yet? his healer was literally reading chat and casting wrath, nobody expected the thing to give him 2 hits and he dies because on private servers they never had this happen to them. you really wanna judge a players entire classic wow skill based on some half assed low lvl dungeon attempt after like what, being awake for 20 hours? holy sh1t some of you really need to fix their stuff
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but what camp are you in? Do you want classic or not? You seem to contradict you‚Äôre self every other sentence?
---
Nah, if you have not memorized every quest in the game are you even good?

That‚Äôs not how reddit works.

No one has made u play any of their x-pacs o.o
---
Hopefully you were smart enough to invest in something else
---
You guys are hilarious : you despise him but you still watch him.
---
I don't like him, I just don't watch him, same for Asmongold (except YT tries every trick to make me watch his videos despite me telling them any channel or video with Asmongold in the title doesn't interest me).
---
Why would they nerf the content?
---
I'm curious are you NA or EU?
---
You're right. And I didnt. Sick statement my dude, use that IQ of yours or dont and I can just call you retarded, clearly i dont mind.
---
Staysafe claims he will do "one big ticket" instead. What a joke.
---
Meanwhile Joana and Frostadamus who would actually beta test stuff is not getting in.,
---
&gt; If you're talking about EN then I checked your kill and it was ONE YEAR late on the achievement. So no, that obviously does not count rofl. That's like killing Ragnaros in TBC at BT patch.
---
Which perfectly explains the Cutting Edge achievement i got.
---
&gt; I've provided you multiple examples be it class, raid encounter etc of how this is just obviously false
---
You have literally not provided a single one..
---
Fuck.... my life is a lie
---
Would be a nice gesture from their part but since they already milked us with the Blizzcon ticket they'd rather milk us again for 45$ for the CHANCE to get into the Beta...
---
As much as I love Vanilla, TBC was really the peak of WoW for me in many aspects. If TBC did not take place in outer space or where ever the "outlands" were supposed to be, and instead took place on Azeroth, then TBC would have easily been my favorite WoW of all time.
---
TBC just really perfected what Vanilla WoW was still trying to figure out. For example, by TBC, the development team had a really good sense of what different classes and specs were supposed to be about. They fixed up the talent trees that really made every class more enjoyable. I can't think of a class that complained about their talent tree changes. The gear they added was also a "perfected" version of Vanilla, but they didn't take away from how special certain gears were too you. I remember getting epic tier armor was still really special in TBC. I also liked the inclusion of the new professions like jewel crafting, which was kind of another type of enchanting. It added more depth to the game without taking anything away.
---
Overall, TBC felt like the "just right" version in between vanilla and wotlk. The only reason I would rather play Vanilla is because of the flying mount issue and the separated world issue. The flying mounts turned pvp servers into pve servers. As soon as you mount up, it was as if you turned your pvp flag off. There's no rogue waiting on a road and cheapshotting you as you get to a destination anymore. In Vanilla, it was hard getting away bcause you had to run through mobs that could daze and dismount you. In TBC, if you managed to mount up, you were basically completely safe.
---
If Classic becomes a hit, and Blizzard decides to make expansions, I hope they expand in Azeroth, and never put in flying mounts. I hope they bring back the good ideas from TBC, because TBC had a lot of good ideas.
---
Easy : roll an ally rogue and go gank some unsuspecting orc :D
---
Thanks :-)
---
I love the danger of open world PVP people being able to turn up and fuck shit up randomly just feels so authentic.
---
Glad I could help! No need to force yourself to play retail when you could just go to work and pay with money.
---
Ctp Placeholder was the guy.
---
I really hope they go down the adding end-game content and not the expansion pack route.
---
I'm in my own camp that wants new content and not the shit that no one wants?
---
Have you even thought about the future or does your brain fucking stop at release?
---
Did they really spend 16 hours in wailing caverns?
---
If they start reporting every single boss for not being an easy kill i'm scared blizzard listens and starts tuning down...
---
Yes, yes, relevant information, how all the back end stuff works, but are you angry about layers or angry about people angry about layers? there is a binary switch on this sub and I need to know what position yours is in so I can agree with you and pat you on the back and we can circlejerk about how people in the other camp are wrong, or if I need to hate you deeply and irrationally about your feelings on a 15 year old online video game.
---
lost in WC? ANYONE who didn't play horde would get lost in WC, even people who played Horde would get lost in WC.
---
I was like 4 years old or something when I started it, and I am in my last year of school when classic releases. 
---
I don't know if I played in 2004, but  I did play back in vanilla \^\^
---
sure did, ive spent 16 dollars on worse things
---
I played on and off on a private server as a dry run for Classic. Got to 55 over a couple of months playing pretty casually. We're finally close enough to launch that I don't want to risk burning out practicing or playing much of the beta, but it's probably worth it to try for level 20 or 30 some time this summer. I wouldn't suggest touching a private server now that beta access is starting to roll out, as we can see now just how different Nost-Core and Classic actually are; we're going to have to unlearn so many bad habits from Pservers and Modern WoW, it'd be a shame to make those bad habits worse!
---
Not at all comparable.  You can't just go out and play professional football.  You _can_ just play a video game.
---
But what he DID was report a boss for doing too mach damage, while the group just fucked up. It's one thing being a bad player but being bad and be unable or unwilling to see that, that's another story.
---
Bruh... just stop.... being this way...
---
Is VC an NA name for Deadmines? 
---
Played on EU and never saw it given a two letter acronym other than DM. We managed fine knowing the difference between Deadmines and Dire Maul.
---
&gt; implementing an effective model swap option would actually require significant development time, and isn't just something the devs can turn on at a whim.
---
Uhhhhhhh yeah they can. They had it since WoD and took it out in BfA (assholes, I loved using old models when on my Troll male characters because I hated the new Troll male animations). All they gotta do is pull that code in from the patch that had it available in the options screen and shove it back into place. It's probably a command they could run in their source code repository system to revert the commit that removed the option. If they're using git, it's literally 1 `git revert -n [sha of the commit(s)]` command.

It actually looks okay as centered. I don't mind the black bars.

How did you get those?

Yes, classic is just a new emulation of vanilla wow.
---
I don't think you're giving him enough. They guy's been streaming for a decade. He knows his audience, he knows what people want to see, he knows how to get the views. The guy's not an invalid sperg. He knows what he's doing.
---
It's amazing to me how people like you consistently fail to see the act that virtually all streamers are putting on. I'm not saying they're all fake (though some are very much so), but if you honestly can't see they're putting on a show deliberately, I really don't know what to tell you.
---
Im going to go for R14 and use my little brother as a hu-bot. Account rules are I can let a minor (my brother) play on my account and he hates leveling but loves PvP.
---
I'm not telling you all warriors should be prot spec.
---
I'm telling you they shouldn't roll warrior if they never want to tank.
---
What would you think of a druid that don't want to use one of it's sphere of ability (heal / tank / dps cat or dps balance) when it's needed ?
---
You're a hunter ? Sometimes you have to kite.
---
You're a mage ? Sometimes you have to decurse.
---
thx bro
---
you never even played vanilla , you probally made it to 40 on some private server some time recently lol
---
It‚Äôs a very heated debate about what it‚Äôs called. I just always remember it being:
---
VC = deadmines 
---
DM = dire maul
---
I‚Äôve played NA and EU and seem remember it being that way on bother sides of the pond. Was a long time ago though so I could be wrong.
---
Because people have stupid opinions about things that don't affect them.
---
Exactly.
---
Patchwerk on that server has like 5700 armor when he really has 3700, it's not a good server if your goal is authenticity.
---
He might be talking about gun skill. But ranged weapon skill doesnt really matter in Classic.
---
Dwarves have stone skin which is god-tier pvp. But thats about it.
---
Make it rain downvotes!
---
"WoW: Classic Expansion" is not an expansion. It is a standalone game. 
---
Also, it is not possible to be "an actual down syndrome" since one cannot *be* a disorder but rather *have* one. 
---
Good luck on your adventures.
---
Can anyone say if the ah is limited to 1 page every 10 seconds like in vanilla or we can finally scan the hell out of it like tbc onwards...
---
only if you are a nightelf
---
To tipsout? Still am, because I havent gone to his channel lol. But when I do get there I am. I was subbed after the first classicast episode came out.
---
Geezers back at it again üòéüòéüòé
---
100% guaranteed bug is the ‚Äûlag‚Äú-excuse of 2019.
---
Read the context. Issue is that not all humanoid models in Classic have a modern equivalent. They can implement a swap easily enough, but it would take actual work to develop new models for many NPCs that were removed in Cata or later.
---
In 1.12 at least, all +damage on spells is +damage and healing. However, it's more expensive statbudgetwise compared to raw +healing. See [this] (https://classicdb.ch/?item=13161#dropped-by&gt;) for instance.
---
The only exceptions I can think of is greens with 1 spell school like [...] of frozen wrath or certain blues with only one school of magic increased.
---
No need to spend real when you could spend in game currency... 
---
Also, just a heads up, unless someone specifically asks for advice (there's subs for that) , maybe don't go around telling people on an anonymous public forum how to spend their money ? You know absolutely nothing about me so it's comical that you think you can, or should, impose into strangers lives in such a manner.

That was my attempt at politely saying to mind your own fucking business :)

cant wait for the group finder addon ;p)
---
Not true. There are many aspects that pservers got wrong and it worked in their favor as well. Mob pathing, boss abilities that won't work right, boss armor and resistances,  etc
---
I know :) affiliates and partners get the same cut. But there's also a bigger cut for bigger partners.
---
They did.
---
You need to see a doctor asap, your salt levels might indicate high blood pressure.
---
I prefer Skada, myself. Details is the Linux of damage meter addons and too overwhelming. Recount isn't as smooth to use as Skada and from what I've understood, more performance-impactful.
---
Same.
---
Well, you got me thinking.
---
Thanks Dad.
---
The asmongold method to successful streaming/content creation : Know wtf you are taking about and choose a persona.
---
You can feign death shadowmeld into eating drinking. Or FD-shadowmeld into invis-pot for extra mindgames. It‚Äôs a skill which is useless on paper but if you‚Äôre creative with its use its awesome.
---
Where is the thrash blade?
---
I would guess that these were added to all players due to issues, hence the 'bumpy ride' title.
---
Why prioritize ppl who played during Blizzcon Alpha? Doesnt playing and paying since vanilla show genuine interest and dedication?
---
Lol, nice.
---
Yes, you are right, the FOV calculation is a bit more involved than simple vertical minus. I just didn't want to go into details. :)
---
However in Vanilla in wider aspect ratios it *did* chop off large chunks at the top and bottom. Not as much as in pure vertical minus but almost. Some could argue that it's inferior to how it is in Classic and in modern.
---
In any case it should be very easy for Blizzard to add at least a FOV slider. Even if they didn't bother to reimplement the exact FOV calculations from Vanilla, with a slider everyone could use something which suits their tastes better.
---
Have you gotten into the beta? I subbed june 2005 and still nothing. :(
---
Not even close. DamageMeters is the authentic experience, even though it was complete ass. https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5294-DamageMeters.html
---
I cant imagine it. Theyve done a good job at keeping Vanilla authentic, I can see them keeping the whole original trilogy sacred. An instant 58 is still pay to win in BC, especially. It's not as hard as Vanilla to get there, but it still takes a lot of effort. Plus, imagine how painful doing Ramparts runs would be with a brand new 58 in your party who doesn't know the first thing about their class.
---
Keep in mind, it's practically printing money. It's an already developed game that takes very minimal maintenance, that people will pay $180 a year to play. Thats insane, and the amount of people that would quit from any sort of Pay to win mechanic would drop subs.
---
I dont. The reason you got those free credits was because you couldn't play the game because servers were down or whatever. 
---
I rather have servers working and not getting any free playtime than getting free playtime but i can't play because the servers are down.
---
Is there not a 16:9 version of this picture? Thought there was... the 21:9 one you have looks cut off at the top and bottom compared to the one I was using for my wallpaper.
---
Daggers pls
---
Wouldn't be so sure. I've had a few people argue against retail's accessibility options in Classic.  
---
I'm inclined to believe they were all arrogant and determined enough to get what they wanted, no matter how much of a heel they had to become.

I got in last night, a day after my brother, who was also a Day One account.

&gt;Which perfectly explains the Cutting Edge achievement i got.
---
Sigh. 
---
Looking at it again the date is in US format. 
---
You killed it on 11/1/17. that means you were **over 1/4 of a year behind** for killing it.
---
So yeah, every point ive raised re waiting on gear etc to faceroll shit because you cant play still applies. 
---
But EN Xavius is also widely considered a complete joke as an end tier boss anyway. Although, EN was considered something of a joke as well as a whole as it was all a bit undertuned.
---
Xavius was just EXTREMELY undertuned and easier than cenarius even by far. 
---
Your Xavius kill which was gotten extremely late on a joke boss of a joke tier doesn't change anything.
---
&gt;You have literally not provided a single one..
---
Ok. I gave you specific monk examples, AND I gave you a design example from M Mythrax. etc
---
If you aren't capable of reading then that's unfortunate.
---
I never knew addons could teleport you to the dungeon.
---
I wonder if racial restrictions, or lack of certain races, is playing a part in what people play.
---
Agreed. Retail graphics, sound, draw distance... none of these alter the sense of danger, community, world or progression people argue they want.
---
I found a way.

---
Joanas route wasn‚Äôt optimized at all relative to the routes people are coming up with these days, joana himself has been saying that for a while. First 30 on horse is even slower than ally so that‚Äôs irrelevant as well. You‚Äôll see what I mean when joana does his 1-30 over the next couple days.
---
We are all going to die so much in Classic. I can't wait!!!
---
Where do you find these transactions? My history only goes as far as 2010 on Bnet.
---
I also have the brain capacity to call you retarded, thanks for your sentiment of a quick reply ;)
---
Tbh it might be just as or more efficient as questing, but both can be mundane so it's probably nice to switch it up, especially during a beta where you know your hard work will be wiped away.
---
He prob experimenting as well, venruki was speculating on the aoe vs questing speeds so I'm sure all the mages will test it out during beta .
---
As someone likely rolling a mage, I'm stoked to see what spec will be the best
---
No matter what it's gonna be a hell of a grind
---
Could not keep on watching them, i assume some of theyr "plays" was for "content" but jezus, thous top streamers talk about classic like they are topdogs, but theyr a joke. Imagine they report this boss for "bugs" coz he shits on them, and blizz nerfs it. &lt;- this is how we got retail right now, noobs complaining and reporting that content is too hard or it's "bugged". Beta testers btw.
---
Basically all the GMs friends are given a seat on the loot council and they give all the gear to their little inner circle first.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a fair loot council in my life, if your in a guild that uses a loot council: run.
---
Unless they are your friends and you just get loot funnelled to you, then I guess stay.
---
Not that I can find. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bovm0n/classic_wow_ragnaros_artwork_upscaled_to_9600x3840/) is the one I used.
---
Get a proper job.
---
Frost and Madseason are EU guys. I haven‚Äôt heard of any EU guys getting into the beta yet.
---
Imagine being a chick online just wanting to play some wow and any comment you make that implies you're a woman gets comments asking for nudes
---
Did ya even bother reporting any bugs you came across?
---
Don't get me wrong I love Details. But it would be a pain to get live in classic as compared to recount
---
Good thing there at least are a few decent beta tester testing stuff right now, unlike this :P
---
Not 38 and no family BUT a important career I can‚Äòt sacrifice for classic. I‚Äòm not expecting to run AQ and Naxx but I hope some guilds will take me into molten core and onyxis when they have them on farm (I will need rly long for 60 I assume)
---
Why would they bother? They didn't for some other humanoids until later Legion into BfA.
---
I always remember Verdan hitting like 5 trucks.
---
There are quite a few EU guys in already
---
I'll be 43 when Classic releases. I was likewise an avid raider through WotLK. Though I'm single with no kids, I have a great career that I work at least 50 hours a week at and I dont get home till late EST US. Even to this day sleep is somewhat optional. My concern is finding a raiding guild that I can progress with despite my schedule. I've considered a west coast server but even then I wont be on until 9:45 PST
---
Vanilla in general is like this. People were bad sure. But Crushing blows/crits DESTROYED tanks. Especially poorly gear ones. It's why Vael and other hard hitters were gear checks. Tanks and healers had to be on point or insta-wipes.
---
Lmao I AVTUALLY FORGOT THE SW AH USED TO BE AROUND THE CORNER OMFGGSHSHZBFUBNSF
---
heh, check out when my parents made the worst decision and bought this game for me when i was 8.
---
I think that elite Pserver players will be equally elite in Classic. I played vanilla and also pservers, and although I didn't have too much PvE endgame experience in vanilla (I geared up through PvP and spent all my time PvPing), I didn't really notice much that the pservers got wrong aside from obvious bugs. The class spells and mechanics were still the same as I remembered.
---
I think the problem is, Tips may not be an elite player. Or at least he's not focus on playing well when he's streaming because he's distracted. Someone like Perplexity, or the NOPE crew would dominate Classic. Those guys are extremely good and know the ins and outs of the game really well. Even if the values are off in Classic, they'll adjust quickly.
---
My personal favorite quote of the movie thats for sure
---
That AREN‚ÄôT content creators?
---
Just give me my Classic, and fuck off.
---
To be fair, that's a really hard jump. If you didn't play vanilla :)

DKP is where you earn dragon kill points for each boss you kill. Each item that drops from the boss will have a dkp value assigned to it. Whoever has the most dkp can ‚Äòbid‚Äô on these items. I liked dkp and hope it comes back.
---
Keep in mind you‚Äôre on the clock all day. No time for a girlfriend, not much time for friends, no time to go out really, just gaming professionally all the time.

This meme will not be going away. :P

Oh, nope, sides cut off on mine, I rechecked.
---
Lol god damn.. I played from release through till now. How is he one of the faces of vanilla if he never got to 60 or raided when vanilla was live?
---
So many people wanna play warlock 2? Hmm I didn‚Äòt expect that. Back in the days I can‚Äòt remember seeing that many of them. Am I wrong?
---
Completely missed the point somehow, pretty bold to call other people morons.
---
I'm not a fearmonger, not even sure where that comes from. All I said is that I'd like to have the option to choose between retail and classic graphics because I prefer the new ones. Blizz just needs to implement a slider like the one they removed with BFA that let you use the old models.
---
You're the only one writing up paragraphs that miss the topic by the way, but I'll guess you don't even realize that.

Low effort comment.  8.1.5/0

Depending what crafting itemization they give us warriors could still be relatively OP with some blue +crit gear and a windfury totem.

Yeah, I agree. I have no opinion on Tips Out whatsoever, but this is getting embarrassing. This community is so toxic, and the gatekeeping is at 200%. These last few days, you can hardly find a single post without someone making a comment about how much they hate Tips Out and how he apparently is single-handedly ruining Classic WoW, and that it is an atrocity that he is "representing" the classic community. Guess what, this horrible, toxic behavior from /r/classicwow is  doing more to ruin the community than Tips Out ever will. 
---
All these comments and posts about Tips Out are now clearly breaking rule 2 and 3 on this subreddit, but the mods just allow it to happen every single time. 
---
TL DR: The /r/classic community is just as toxic as Tips Out at this point. Rules 2 and 3 are broken every day, but the mods do nothing.
---
True, your Raid has to have an extraordinary atmosphere, no rivalries/inner groups and everybody should be on the same page mind-set wise, otherwise lootcouncil is a shitshow :X  
---
DKP just means that u get rewarded with Points for Attendance and can spend those points to bid on loot
---
I used to have one of those big CRT monitors that weighed like 50 pounds, and my games were like 800 x 600 resolution. Now people are playing Fortnite on their phones.
---
AMA, doesn't answer any questions for 3 hours.
---
The funny thing is he potted too earlier on lol.
---
i think we had some variation of dkp with some loot council 
---
the council was mostly just to try and make sure everyone got some loot and veto people who wanted shit not really for their class
---
most people who used dkp had some form of loot council to decide stuff like who bindings go to etc. 
---
pure loot council is no good though .
---
but most guilds with a shitty loot system desolve pretty quick .
---
there is so little loot people are shitty even if you have a good loot system so guilds with a shit loot system dont last very long.
---
Had to close down stream when they call out "Bugs" . They talk about vanilla so much, but they are just plain bad, not even bad, terrible. Whole WC run , clown fiesta, boss shit's on them - IT"S BUGGED OMG. Goes to quest, skips quest's, searches for quest mobs with private server websides for 40 mins. Respec's to full feral at lvl20 , losses all the class value from balance tree, losses 1 gold( DRUID PLAYER BTW). Hey im not an elitis't but i hope tons of players like soda , assmongold, noobsout will be there, nothig feels better when u shit on noobs in bg's and overall gameplay.
---
Esfand said on his stream that it‚Äôs on the drop down box above the play button
---
DKP only work if the person keeping the DKP log is behind honest and not changing it in people favour or against people.
---
I mean, its meant to be for the greater good of the raid. Im considering Raid Leading in Classic, if I ran a loot council it would be gearing up the MT + OT + 3 most consistent healers and with DPS it would be shooting the upgrades out by power increase to once again - the most reliable DPS. 
---
I personally wouldn‚Äôt be rushing to give Ashkandi to the Warrior who has attended 2 raids in months. But its also something you develop as a guild.

Greasy.

he didn't stream it, but hes, Skorch, a Gnome Mage, got world first for this beta, no debate there.
---
Woosh
---
Good news is that Joana got into the beta earlier today and streamed for a bit
---
I think if they were gonna try anything like that they'd wait for Wrath since it had paid character services and microtransactions at the time. And there's no way they're not working their way up to Wrath, they'd be crazy not to. Not that I'd put Blizzard above adding level 58 boosts to BC or anything, it'd just be a huge risk, way higher than adding them after ToGC comes out or something
---
your scalloped potatoes are fucked
---
What are some of the bugs you encountered? Did you report any?
---
are there sites, where i can find these kinds of portraits/ frames ?
---
Plenty of time for this to be fixed. This is the point of beta.
---
Good to know!
---
Tbh it's impressive how stupid Rob Wells can make himself seem, like you start to wonder if he's a genius or actually that dumb? Lmaoo that's when you know an actor did their job
---
How is a AMA on this interesting?
---
People have been playing private servers for years now :D
---
Peons are just superior. Something need doing? Work work!
---
Just gotta keep them happy or [this](https://pics.me.me/work-is-da-poop-no-more-orcs-are-getting-woke-27376201.png) happens
---
wellllllllll, wetlands looks like hurricane katrina :)
---
You DO NOT need to subscribe!! SAVE YOUR MONEY I got into beta without subbing and am am to play without subbing. It is complete luck of the draw!
---
&gt; Ok. I gave you specific monk examples, AND I gave you a design example from M Mythrax. etc
---
Are you still incapable of understanding the difference between being able to cast while moving being able to do so constantly?
---
&gt; Xavius was just EXTREMELY undertuned and easier than cenarius even by far.
---
But I also killed Cenarius.
---
But in conclusion I think I can follow what you're saying, basically, the game is hard now, except it isn't, your entire line of arguments makes perfect sense.
---
This is how it was, you had to make sure people were ready. You cant have the tank run in whilst the healer is absent minded or doing something else. People will soon start sitting up strait in the chair when they realise that they need to put some effort and thought into the game now.
---
If you have watched his videos he speaks very clearly and well, the videos have very high production value. All of that makes people think what he says is correct when it's not.
---
 He can say that wotf removes polymorph. He can say that pservers guess armor values. All completely bullshit and easily proven false (I cannot link to pserver bug trackers here). He could say the sky is purple for crying out loud - because all the other stuff about his videos except information is so good, then people think the information must be right too.
---
Because people like this are selfish entitled children and will find a way to justify that they also ‚Äúshould‚Äù get beta because of something they think matters. But what they think doesn‚Äôt really matter. They just want beta so they are having a temper tantrum. 
---
‚ÄúStreamers and select few others got in and NOT ME!?!?‚Äù
---
no that hard to do nowadays, there are a lot of websites/addons which let you run DKP like a bookkeeper and everyone can check his/her DKP gains/losses history etc
---
As if you there weren't any pservers
---
No this is the point of an alpha or internal testing. My point is that blizzard didn‚Äôt pick up on this MAJOR issue up before releasing the beta. Shows laziness and incompetence.
---
That ties into the points on RP, immersion and the point of providing a unified aesthetic. The fact that they only updated around half the models in their first major model update in Late Cata or whatever it was, but left the others untouched for months in an ugly mish-mash? That's one of the things which drove me away and kept me away long enough for me to lose investment in the game.
---
At no point did I say it would be gone 'second week tops', so just knock that strawman down mate.
---
Aye, it'll be easy. But it's sheer luck what layer you end up in. All your mates might end up in the same layer, then what?
---
You're trying to raise hell over scenarios that MIGHT happen, which has been fabricated based on some unrealistic assumptions.
---
I played both a lot before I mained a horde rogue. I think i was swapping between classes a bunch, I thought night elves where the only,ones that could be invisible for the first 10 levels. Switched to human. Leveled a rogue to 32. Quit him and went undead and heated him out the ass. Before all that rogue BS I dabbled with hunter, Druid and paladin. I always wanted a paladin. I am so comfortable with my rogue and love the class so much I‚Äôm sticking with the same race, class and appearance as my original character
---
Yeah the one person who has complete video evidence of how vanilla REALLY was should definitely be in the beta.  They should have begged him to be in the beta to be honest.
---
 9/4/2005N/AFree Month
---
You are really over reacting to a very minor problem. It‚Äôs going to be fixed before release.
---
It's funny, I had the exact opposite experience in the guilds I've used that use councils, the loot councils are so scared of appearing that way they never take anything for themselves.
---
I guess, if you feel a loot council is corrupt you should leave, but I would never be in any guild that used any other form of distribution.
---
I had forgotten about degaussing!
---
Absolutely wild.
---
Um... is there a game behind all that water? :P
---
its worth saying you can sort of manipulate dkp too
---
like i joined a top guild on my server great people 
---
they had everything on farm pre nax
---
first week we did mc to gear new players i got pretty much anything that dropped i could use and ended up on quite a bit negative dkp.
---
i was totally happy with this and homestly its fair but even with a dkp system you can sort of make sure the veterans get first shot at all the good loot.
---
it rewarded people who stuck around and went to raids which is the most important thing , but yeah it sometimes felt like a loot queue
---
Wtf kind of name is tips out for an orc? Sounds like rape. Should be reported
---
this is my worry and one of the reasons i want to get into the beta, started playing on the AQ launch and loved the challenge of a lot of the content when you are new and wouldn't considered an end boss in a dungeon killing you as a bug, its the damn end boss it's meant to be hard. remember when they shortened WC in cata and it just seems so sad that such an epic dungeon was reduced to a 10min run with no real challenge
---
Guys it‚Äòs just a beta.
---
&gt;Are you still incapable of understanding the difference between being able to cast while moving being able to do so constantly?
---
Is this your attempt at changing the topic with some senseless question?
---
&gt;But I also killed Cenarius.
---
Did you actually read everything else I wrote? Obviously not.
---
&gt;But **in conclusion I think I can follow what you're saying**, basically, the game is hard now, except it isn't, your entire line of arguments makes perfect sense.
---
Obviously not, or you wouldn't keep typing such nonsense. 
---
How about we make it simple, since you seem a little simple.
---
Do you still think that this is correct:
---
"literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving.""
---
Also, do you also think that classic raiding is harder than mythic current raiding?
---
-
---
If you answered yes to either of the above, there is no hope for you.
---
Unlikely you'll get rejected, maybe if a guild doesn't need your combination, but that's fine - most guilds likely won't mind :)
---
Let's hope the 2004/2005 thing has any influence on getting picked. Resubbed as soon as beta was announced.
---
Yes, a dwarf with equal gear will always be given priority over you, but it‚Äôs by no means impossible to get into groups just because you‚Äôre not a dwarf
---
Instant casts and CDs for so many classes just didn't really exist. As a shaman when we finally got riptide I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. Just cause you could move and cast it.
---
I would much more like to see new development with the old game ethos in mind. There was so much more that they wanted to include in vanilla that they never got around to.
---
&gt;Are you kidding me? What else would the solution be? Ten foot fingers? 
---
This entire conversation has me in stitches.
---
Only white supremacists use duck duck go lol
---
Sorry but have watched him a few times.
---
No thanks, never again.
---
I preferred him before he got big, and not comes off as a jerk.
---
Do you also have something like that for 2h weapons?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it. Vanilla world first were all done 14 years ago. Any world first come classics release won‚Äôt really be a title to hold onto as the community has has almost 15 years to figure out the most efficient way to do everything.
---
Just play what you want to play and enjoy it.
---
Pic or it didn‚Äòt happen ;)
---
It's funny how things turned out. I remember we got made fun of back in Vanilla because WoW was considered an easy mode MMORPG back then. How the turntables.
---
I have no doubt it will be fixed before release but if you don‚Äôt see a problem with the fact this issue made it all the way to beta, then you are an idiot. 
---
If literally anyone from blizzard played a Tauren before launching the beta this issue would of been fixed as you say. It just worries me that for a huge company and project not a SINGLE employee picked up on this issue. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs worse, they thought this was fine or no one tested playing a Tauren.
---
I got confused when he said that. On his world record he dings level 30 at 1 day 20 minutes /played. I think he got too used to testing stuff on private servers when he claimed 22 hours.
---
Any proof of this?
---
Is your account from 2004/2005?
---
It's DM for both on my server (EU). The level 19 warrior isn't looking to tank Dire Maul.
---
Okay! Thanks!
---
Rogue is all about CC and burst
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRLK5Nke-gE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRLK5Nke-gE)
---
na?
---
old account?
---
own bfa?
---
last time you were subbed?
---
Thanks! I'll just run my NE then :)
---
How are we supposed to believe this?
---
Okay, thanks! I'll just play my Night elf then
---
honestly if, in 3 years, there's anywhere near the number of classic players as there are retail players, surely Blizzard would do a Jagex and realise new content (either TBC onwards or new new content) for classic would make business sense
---
&gt; Also, do you also think that classic raiding is harder than mythic current raiding?
---
Well you're the one who's shitting me calling me trash despite having better results in retail raiding despite having much better results raiding there than most people do in classic, so I'm not sure *you* think otherwise.
---
&gt; "literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving.""
---
Please tell me how you lose performance if moving while channeling EF, applying CoA, casting ice lance or whatever.
---
Two questions:
---
* Is the rogue poison proc animation still in? Like when the poison proced and your "pointed with you hands"? I LOVED IT. Especially on undead.
---
* Are the damage numbers, as they use to be? At the moment in retail they are strange and no feeling to it and till halfway WoD they were kinda "popy" and felt awesome criting.
---
You are never allowed to share accs. If your brother fucks up and lets the acc get hacked, ur outta luck
---
I mean, you clearly can't even name one 'unrealistic assumption' criticism of the layering system is supposed to be based on. So I don't see why you would bring this up in an argument.
---
Well, well, well...
---
How the turntables...
---
Cross-realm BG's is when I stopped doing them. It just lost all the feeling of familiarity and community. Getting grouped with a couple other guys from my realm trying to beat the shit out of a couple other guys from our same realm. We knew each other relatively well from all the fights we've been in and we definately knew our opponents well. 
---
There where certain opponents that where extra prestigious to beat and meeting them in the world had that extra spark to it as their name carried a certain awe and reputation. At the same time meeting people you've spent hours upon hours with trying to steal a flag or defend a blacksmith meant you shared memories and had overcome adversities together. An expanded social circle if you will. You would come to their aid and they would come to yours because you've had each others backs in Alterac Valley multiple times before.
---
All this stopped when cross-realm BG's was introduced because I hardly ever was grouped with, or faced, anyone from my realm ever again. Sure queue times where pretty long at times, but you learned that your server more or less had sort of an ebb and flow. During off hours you'd go do other stuff. Farm consumables, hand in a couple of quests and get ready for when the battle would rage again. At least this was my experience and I loved it.
---
Yes/no, bought a new pc and wanted to check out my old account that I hadn‚Äôt touched since TBC. I‚Äôll admit that the beta was most of the reason, but it was fun seeing all my old toons again as well.
---
Seriously.  Relax and sort for bugs.  That's what it's for after all
---
Mmm, delicious rage!
---
A deserving community member actually got an invite?!?!
---
I think its funny. In vanilla it was pretty much only human and nelf priest. Was very rare to see a dwarf priest. Now everyone is more educated. Only the most tryhard will care about that. If you cant kill bosses without fear ward then that group had more problems then that
---
On pservers yesterday I noticed hell of a lot of NE priests. So I don't think it'll be a problem. I play Human priest and also have no problems in the game. Nobody will care if you're a dwarf or not. Except if it's a hardcore guild that takes the game too serious.
---
i need this as animated wallpaper for mac
---
Well most people at blizzard are over 12 and are smart. So they probably did most of their testing on alliance. This explains why this horde only bug was not discovered.
---
ssssshhhhhh he will call the police ....
---
Classic has so many races and class combinations that is a lifetime of content. People will play it forever. I do the same with Morrowind
---
VC = Dogshit
---
DM = Deadmines
---
DM:E, :W, :N, :T = Dire Maul's respective wings.
---
You never do a full run of dire maul, so whenever it's DM with no affix it's deadmines.
---
Go back to your failed game for noobies then.
---
IIRC, there's a substantial difference between the starting areas of alliance vs Horde. I think the Horde (especially the Barrenss) had a better leveling experience early on.
---
That's what I was thinking, guess I got too used to random groups blaming the healers later in the game, thanks!
---
Look up the rules my man, children cant have there own accounts - they can share with a family member though. Its been this way forever - if he was 18 it would be different but he is 13.
---
Hacking issue is ez, i‚Äôll just login for him anyway - he can only play on my PC realistically.
---
Beta testers btw. They will test our game guys, so we can play with no problems. But i think in order to test the game, you should know how the game works, no ?Ok. Nvm.
---
Yeah, going casual, just wanted to be sure it wouldn't impact my life too much, thanks!
---
Lol yikes
---
&gt; Fuck I chose a wrong path
---
You don't want the life of Asmongold. At least not if you currently have a job and are of average mental health.
---
Exqueeze-me-bitchh? 
---
/s
---
It wont even work like that. my fear is that i might actually have to wait for a while before i can see my friend because hes in another Layer... till they merge them. But i guess we will see
---
Only bootlickers give a monopoly on their personal information to any single corporation.
---
Oh graduate school indeed. At least I'll have classic WoW to help me cope with the drudgery!
---
Cooldowns and instant cast WERE quality of life after vanilla. "What... you mean I can move.... AND CAST?! THE WONDERS OF TECHNOLOGY"
---
Where's that Theresa May meme someone posted a few weeks ago?
---
Who cares if they hate you? Starshards ftw!
---
This!
---
Beta is not a free for all... they‚Äôre better off with a smaller quality group of people so they don‚Äôt get lost in an ocean of thousands of bug reports.
---
Rogues pull more DPS until very late game. (Like Naxx or something)
---
Rogues have TONS of CC. Huge for pve and pvp.
---
Rogues can speed cap a flag in WSG. Rogues can backdoor AV. Rogues can backdoor AB bases.
---
Rogues have poisons.
---
Rogues have options when soloing to pick and choose their fights. Stealth in general is huge, and there's only one other class that has it in vanilla.
---
Rogues have a higher skill ceiling than warrior.
---
Not sure what your point is truthfully. It's definitely well known that rogues are very powerful duelers/world pvpers and was always lauded during and after vanilla. World of Roguecraft is a great example.
---
Disgusting
---
Thanks for all the feed back I'm trying shaman out in beta rn. I think if I were to go shaman I would go ele/resto off heals. That seems to be the most viable option.
---
What races are missing?
---
The first time you see a Murloc, have them kill you. Get your first murloc death over with as soon as possible because there will be plenty of them anyways.
---
Lmao this is great
---
Priestesses of Elune are the best priestesses!
---
Because I didn't like the NE zones back in the day I'd make a lvl 1 NE character and then just run it to Elwyn Forest. 
---
You'd die in Wetlands once or twice from the Crocs but spawn in a Graveyard further ahead most of the time and just rez at the GY.
---
feature for warriors, not a bug
---
Lmao - I saw the term used by Overwatch players so I assumed it meant play of the game (because the potg system wasn‚Äôt that good)
---
Close enough
---
You only want 2/3 improved blizzard when AoE farming so it doesn't overwrite your CoC
---
When Classic releases it will reach a million vieuws easily on twitch, for months aswell. Every notable streamer and their mom will play Classic. If hype would need a definition, it would be how classic drops in August .
---
I am sure sample size of 17 reflects a lot on class choices
---
I watched. I laughed. I posted on Reddit.
---
I despise him? Did I just black out and ragetype about how much I hate him? I thought I was laughing while making fun of him for being horrible at a game that he portrayed himself as being one of the best at. 
---
I watched a few of his videos and got kind of familiar with him. He seems like a decent guy. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and seeing him play was seriously fucking hilarious. He represents so many people from classic. 
---
Took me back to the days when you only have one tank who sucks but he is your only option for the moment. How many times did you just want to tell dude it was retarded but delete the text and type out ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok guys we got it this time!‚Äù
---
It explicitly states you must be subbed so I‚Äôm not buying that you can get in unsubbed.
---
No invite so reading Reddit and wishing I had your talent in drawing. :)
---
I have not been following runescape at all. Did osrs effectively kill off rs3?
---
username checks out
---
Here it begins
---
Any one i could watch on twitch and not cringe ?
---
this guy is so pathetic and annoying
---
Don't forget FFZ (FrankerfaceZ)
---
FFZ = Static emotes
---
BTTV = Gif emotes
---
Knowledge is power, Asmongold has alot of knowledge.
---
TBC best expac
---
Not that I remember. You either tank or DPS.
---
**GET OUT OF MY HEAD !!!!!!!one111!!1one!!!** 
---
;P
---
Na
---
Account from 2008? Maybe I cant remember 
---
Owns BFA
---
Last sub October 2018
---
I have a day 1 EU account with collectors edition with gametime on it. No invite :(
---
Well to be fair, you can't go wrong with Deadmines.
---
Day 1 acc, EU here. No inv :(
---
You'll have the last laugh as you're dropping Starshards on people's heads
---
To get into the beta you need to know someone, who knows someone that knows someone who‚Äôs working at Blizzard. Good you got in Joanna
---
So given that, why have the draw limit for weather only go up a certain height?
---
these:

[https://www.twitch.tv/tribe\_tv1](https://www.twitch.tv/tribe_tv1)
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya](https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya)
---
&gt;Well you're the one who's shitting me calling me trash despite having better results in retail raiding despite having much better results raiding there than most people do in classic, so I'm not sure you think otherwise.
---
Can you try typing this out again, but in intelligible english this time?
---
&gt;Please tell me how you lose performance if moving while channeling EF, applying CoA, casting ice lance or whatever.
---
Please tell me how you don't lose performance while running the gauntlet on jaina as a MW monk, for example?
---
The ONLY way your statement would make any sense is IF you had a mechanic that PERFECTLY lined up with when you would want to use EF that forced movement AND you didn't need to move subsequent to EF etc.
---
The crux is this:
---
You made a stupid statement that just isn't true. 
---
You speak of difficulty of live raiding when you have never actually experienced it since you never actually raid current mythic content at any kind of a reasonable level. Case in point - you have ZERO end boss kills in multiple expansion while they are relevant. Your only ONE kill is MONTHS late and on the only complete joke end boss in the past 2 expansion.
---
You speak of performance and efficiency, yet your logs show that you can't even play your own class even remotely close to competently or efficiently.
---
Bearing these things in mind, it seems pretty obvious that your opinions are uninformed and incorrect. Especially when they are making statements contrary to general consensus.
---
It's like someone at 1300 arena rating who has only ever been 1300 trying to argue with someone that high rating arena pvp is easier now than it was before. Then having someone more experienced come in and point out why that is wrong, only for them to repeatedly make stupid off topic comments to try and avoid looking stupid.
---
Here comes the nerd brigade to tell you how you should ackshually be playing and enjoying yourself
---
Seed it with the type of grass seed you find at pet stores (alfalfa maybe?). You‚Äôll see results within a week.
---
This won't be Nostalrius. A lot of the garbage elitism we saw on private servers is not going to dominate servers. Top guilds will take issue if they're in progression and it would cost you a spot and premade PvP possibly but that's about it.
---
There will always be people who min/max but this is classic. It's going to be a massive nostalgia party and there will literally be millions of casual players who play whatever the hell they want. Be one of them.
---
A 401K is an investment fund for poor people.
---
Remember when people jumped straight into the lava to get into MC?
---
Tauren had to in the first few patches. Because they legit got stuck in the window.
---
Well, performance. You don't have to render what the player can't see.
---
I think you can receive the invite unsubbed although you have to Sub in order to Play the beta
---
You're saying after optimising his route for a year, and learning stuff (like autoloot), he won't be able to shave two hours from his own time? We're talking 24--&gt;22, nothing unlikely.
---
Thanks for this comment man. I really hope they take this route, would be amazing.
---
Good stuff, thanks for sharing!
---
&gt;awful
---
after the wipe.... an other warrior in tips grp tanks Verdan.... WITHOUT A SHIELD !!! :)
---
This. 
---
Still... they were good times.
---
I'f there was then you would hear about it
---
To be fair the whole dungeon is super easy except that last boss who hits like a truck, he got caught off guard
---
I also laughed, but to be fair by a certain point in Vanilla Quest addons were very common. So I think he probably just used questie or something if he played back in the day.
---
Yes, and innervate was the 31pt resto talent. What‚Äôs your point? Classic is based on 1.12.
---
15 year old content, a beta for accuracy, and a handful of people who don't actually know what to look for. yup, we've got all the ingredients needed for hollow world firsts.
---
Right... but what I'm saying is the rendering of weather effects should have been a sphere around the player, rather than having to do weird weather tubes for flight paths and such. Then flying mounts don't matter to weather rendering.
---

---
Good chance lack of dynamic respawns slow people right down. Most pservers have increased spawn rates
---
what makes you say that?
---
Tries to heal with regrowth at lvl 20.  
---
"I'm oom".
---
The reason for dark night being alleviated was that some people can only play at night, because of work or whatever. That's what blizz said if I remember correctly.
---
Considering he just had 100k people watching him so do I think a lot of people like this guy, and what do you mean streamers streaming streamers?
---
The stream liteeally brought 100k nostalgic viewers to watch some deadmines. It's a different thing to have a quick glance of vanilla and actually playing it 1-60.
---
 25/2/2005 N/A Free Month
---
there seems to be a lot of  1-days Exempt  early on!
---
thanks for this info! It was nice to find out when it all started :)
---
&gt; Please tell me how you don't lose performance while running the gauntlet on jaina as a MW monk, for example?
---
I never said anything even remotely close to this, this is where you're moving the goal posts in your attempts to discredit what I'm saying.
---
&gt; You speak of difficulty of live raiding when you have never actually experienced it since you never actually raid current mythic content at any kind of a reasonable level. 
---
So basically, your point is, unless you day-raid in retail and kill bosses in the first week, they're completely trivial and I'm terrible for not killing them, yet retail raiding is hard?
---
That looks like a hit list for a shady cabal.
---
There‚Äôs already been someone on here get an invite who started playing during legion, so they aren‚Äôt just giving it out to older players.
---
&gt;You also do not need to be subbed to play the beta
---
yes you do. i have a friend who got invited directly and had to buy a sub before he could log in.
---
Beta is like vanilla, you can check by comparing beta to private servers. Was it that hard?
---
To be fair Wildstar had similar viewer numbers in 2014. I think classic WoW will be a big success but don't over-react to streamer numbers. Anthem was near the top on release.
---
Yes, but turning it on gives you special traits that help with open world PvE along with an exp boost. So it's very incentivized to have it on. You can also only change it off and on in the major cities. So you can't just escape a gank situation without using a lot of time
---
Alex is unbearable, he's the type of guy who freaks out because there is too much grass on the ground or because you can swap the orders of character in the login screen and shit like that; and if you think differently than him you're automatically a virgin cuck sjw blizz shill beta male
---
Doesn't work on auto-attack tho
---
They definitely do. The stories I could tell...
---
&gt; I think this shows genuine interest and dedication
---
You could make the argument that the people who like to be dedicated wouldn't play much on the demo as any dedication they had would go to waste.
---
Calm down Beavis
---
Its very high for one person but this stream gets tens of thousands normally so its not at all unexpected for him. Its worth noting that any game with hype will get this viewership. Anthem got it, Wildstar got it in 2014 when it was a bigger deal and those games didn't last.
---
I personally think classic will be a massive success but this viewership isn't in anyway unexpected or an indicator of future success.
---
From what I‚Äôve read, would be a good choice for a pvp smite priest. Star shards had better DPM than mindflay if you are not in shadow form.
---
Also you can shadowmeld the cast mind control, good for bgs 
---
Personally I‚Äôm torn between undead and troll ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The truth ? Predatory tactic ? Did you perhaps believe you deserved more than the others to join the beta ?
---
What is wrong with Blizz rewarding their most loyal players with an early access to the beta ? You'd be surprised to learn even players from vanilla played BFA, some even claiming to have been there for vanilla beta.  
---
Why would a classic fan having plates vanilla but no longer playing retail for year would be rewarded over a classic fan playing retail for years ?
---
Why no stream?
---
I don't remember enough, but they did have weather with flying. We saw that in wotlk. Or I want to remember seeing snow and such in nortthrend.
---
Outland just didn't have any weather effects because of the nature of the planet.
---
But yea, weather effects were most likely rendered around your character as you say, anything else is pretty silly.
---
He does, tips is clueless
---
For the first time since WotLK I'm gonna keep my sub for a while. Guess we'll see which one I play more but no matter what I'm gonna enjoy myself. And hopefully (be forced) to make some friends along the way
---
nope don't need to be subbed as my post states.
---
No, classic will not have cross realm technology or sharding. How ever it WILL have layering at launch until it‚Äôs no longer needed.
---
[https://imgur.com/3sxv7zm](https://imgur.com/3sxv7zm)
---
And another group wipes as the DPS go nuts trying to beat each other. :D
---
Same, on multiple accounts that I have had since Vanilla/tbc
---
oh let them pay, not-so-smart people deserve to be additionally charged ;)
---
Whenever I think of Vanilla huntards I just think of the hunter in my guild who was named "Lighting" because he spelled Lightning wrong. Whole guild watched him fail the hunter legendary quest in Desolace for hours. So good.
---
holy shit that guy is bad and salty haha
---
Look, i believe classic will be a massive success but people saying this means nothing are right. Anthem had this viewership, wildstar had this viewership in 2014 and a bunch of other games that failed had this viewership.
---
Imo classic will be insanely successful but lets not overplay high viewership on twitch, it happens pretty often when a game has any hype behind it
---
As far as i know it will be there in the beginning because of server performance.
---
It will be removed later.
---
There will be pvp and pve realms.
---
Let me guess: Druid?
---
The stream literally brought 100k nostalgic, hyped viewers. This is just the "you think you do" part. 
---
We can only see about the secone part when the game launches and people actually start playing.
---
I've waited this for a long time myself, don't get me wrong. But this logic just supports the nostalgia hype if something.
---
Its DM. Only retards call Deadmines VC.
---
&gt;I never said anything even remotely close to this,
---
If you want to call it "moving the goalposts" then your question is exactly that. Because all i did was phrase a scenario to you in exactly the same way as you attempted to do. I even explained the only way what you said could be correct. 
---
&gt;So basically, your point is, unless you day-raid in retail and kill bosses in the first week, they're completely trivial and I'm terrible for not killing them, yet retail raiding is hard?
---
No, more like, unless you are at least ~top 500 which is easily done on 2-3 raiding nights then you are not seeing the bosses as they are intended, and you are almost certainly awful at playing your class - as are your guildmates - which is why you are not.
---
&gt;yet retail raiding is hard?
---
Apparently for you, and your guild at the very least, it is extremely hard. üòÇ
---
look mom i killed the streamer!
---
Nothing wrong with the way he plays. Just lol at giving him a hard time because a click a button here and there.
---
Well he wasted his money. I am playing without a sub and got invited without a sub.
---
Exactly, which is why people are going to burn out fast and the playerbase is going to go down pretty sharply.
---
There's only so many ways you can say, here, do the same content you did years ago with the suspension of disbelief. It's quite something seeing streamers react like they haven't seen something 400 times already.
---
Then there is people which raid in BFA, now raiding in Classic having to maintain two accounts for two mmos, that's the bigger problem here. I'm honestly scared for some guilds as players migrate, All that's really going to happen is BfA players move onto classic, it won't be the other way about.
---
I dunno, interesting times ahead, no company has ever released their game again. Other than Old School runescape I guess?
---
300 per swing on average, on a roughly 900 hp pool. If you don't chain heal you will die.
---
Don't think so because in his guide he handles all the starter zones and then switches to Loch Modan/Darkshore...
---
Only Taurens and Nelf can play druids in Vanilla.
---
Ah yes of course, there's no such thing as personality which might make people enjoy watching someone else, and there's no possibility for discussion and seeing others opinions on a game when watching someone else play, and there's no such thing as being really good at a game so you might want to watch it either for learning from  them or seeing them do something really cool you could never pull off. Btw most people can't "just play this video game" considering it's beta, which means only very few people are able to play it.
---
Nice one. 13/03/2005. :)
---
Seriously though, I know it's a joke but as we've all seen by now, there are issues to be tackled by Blizz and this game needs bug testing. Meanwhile the lucky ones that get beta invites refuse to test class mechanics or the game in general but play a solid 30 hours to reach lvl 30 as fast as possible and then start an AMA here like "Look at me, I'm the fastest mage in Mexico! Hey! You shall look at me! Why does nobody care?!"
---
Well anyway, glad that there are at least a few beta testers who actually do what they're supposed to do.
---
And casting Regrowth instead of HT and Rejuvenation.
---
That spell is so expensive it's ridiculous. An adult casting that shit makes me question their intelligence.
---
I was watching his stream last night and he got one shot by everliving in WC and was swearing it was bugged damage wise. Other tanks it with a two hander and they kill it.
---
I knew the jig was up then
---
‚ÄúNeed to have an active subscription or active game time on our battle.net account to be considered for the testing period.‚Äù
---
My account was created on January 2nd of 2006 which is also my birthday. So close but yet so far.
---
This was fucking hilarious to watch
---
Why does my battle.net launcher not have this drop box feature.. any ideas?
---
TIL, time to respec... again
---
Shadow Meld + Mind Control &gt; Fear Ward
---
its too fun
---
Username checks out
---
Madeason EU ... what?
---
welp there's the photos to prove it. Don't know what to tell you besides the fact that I am playing the beta WITHOUT a subscription.
---
wait, what?
---
I had an amazing time playing my undead priest in vanilla.
---
My first plan is to enjoy the game.  
---
I already had a discussion with my mates because they told me to freaking out in leveling and min/maxing out anything.  
---
I mean ofc. I will take a look in BiS-Lists and ofc. my plan is to have a good economy that i can use a mount.  
---
But I will not spend all my time to this game like my mates.
---
It wasn't a race, just someone's personal way to enjoy the game.
---
Hmmm not sure tbh. However, if your account does get flagged for beta it will appear.
---
As tempting as it sounds I really don't envy streamers who stream as a job. Like, this is your income and you have to stick with it whether you like the game or not. I've seen it many times that people hating the game they once loved because they've burnt out but if they switch from their main game the views drop so low.
---
Are you branching out to Duskwood now?
---
&gt;never played the real vanilla
---
Not really a skill indicator. People began to become somewhat good closer to WotLK and most of the skilled players comes from pservers.
---
Is he not EU??
---
The QoL change came because it was very easy just to look it up, people intentionally gimping themselves in the name of "Interaction" need to get checked.
---
If I don't know where a mob is, I go to WowHead, there's a comment from 4 expansions ago telling me where it is. You're expecting people not to use the resources they have now as if it's back in the olden days.
---
The playerbase and gamers have changed massively, I'm sorry but I genuinely want to know why you want this running around lost feeling. In my mind it's get the loot, get the quests done, get the raiding on and get the game completed, maybe we have different play styles? But BfA supports me much more easily in that I can do all of that quite quickly to get to the content I want to do.
---
If you have such a strong feeling of it, why not just disable map markers?
---
&gt; I just hope blizz don't fuck it up in the end
---
Wanna bet how long it'll take until they implement the store with mounts, pets and gold/token?
---
Ofc pservers players will be elitists but I have a feeling they will be surprised because some things will work different on live servers than on pservers. Abilities will be different and a lot of numbers will be wrong as they are used to. Sp maybe new strategies will be made you never know.
---
No they didn‚Äôt - they made it easier in 2.4.3 AND later on in Wrath IIRC. They did about half to 3/4 the leveling.
---
No kidding, xQc was having computer issues two nights ago and chat was a mix of people trying to get him to blow up his computer and people with actual sensible advice, of course he didn't do ANY of the sensible things.
---
This game played on 2004 computers.
---
Why tf do people keep asking this same damn question
---
You also need a sub to this sub to play Classic.
---
I think you could yes, that was the lowest possible res.
---
Retail Omegalul
---
Nope you're not wrong. They were just garbage until their revamp on 1.6 (?). The most of the players already had their main and didn't want to level up another toon. That's why they were underpopulated. 
---
But as we know today they are top DPS (with good gear) so everyone wants to play one.
---
They're incredibly reliant on a 10min CD though. I used to PVP a lot as a human shadow priest and 1v1 vs undead rogues was a very even fight. They've only got a 90% to stay stealthed when they sap which frequently breaks their chain of CC (as can resto or free action pots). This time I'll be playing a Troll so rogues will have no WotF and I'll get three 10% chances to stun them when they open. I'm more scared of warriors than rogues.
---
There is no such thing as world first in a closed beta.
---
They should be testing stuff not flexing their e-peen.
---
That video was taken in TBC.
---
Map? I really hope your reffering to the mini-map - which is useless in dungeons anyway.
---
just a lil drinkie poo
---
https://youtu.be/CKhjezrkJNU?t=68
---
Laugh away.
---
I'm sorry, not many people follow these streamers? And you name asmongold, the one actually successful streamer in wow (with soda when he's there)? Do you actually know what you're talking about?
---
I'm too old to watch Twitch usually, but damn.. I watched the whole run. Let me in the game now..
---
The way i see it on popularity is Warrior-Mage-Rogue-Warlock-Priest-Hunter-Shaman-druid-paladin.
---
But seeing warlocks having threat issues while leveling, they might drop down the list abit
---
Nobody cares that you know how git works
---
It‚Äôs not the same engine.
---
Isn't madseason NA?
---
I think a personality will be chosen over that as well as personal character.
---
playing one race that you dont like over another that you do just because of a minor detail will break your experience. you can push this minor detail by being a better player with better attitude. a nice guy who can be there for the raid and knows what to do will do much much more than 5% spirit or fear ward
---
Touch√©
---
The top pics on this look like the warcraft movie so I kinda thought there was another I didnt see, but I guess it's just a cinematic.
---
Okay thanks man congrats on the beta you lucky dog.
---
https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/world-of-warcraft-legion/13071
---
pretty sure it stopped the charge in actual vanilla
---
source: played hunter :D
---
Only Horde will hate you. Shadowmeld + Mind Control + the chain to go to BRD/MC while they have world buffs = Pure Rage.
---
Same, I would add a sub if I got an invite, but definitely won't add a sub to hope for an invite.
---
Good read, thanks
---
Even Blizzard knows 2 months in we won't need server layering.
---
If people are able to play more than me or enjoy playing more efficiently than me, then that must mean they aren‚Äôt having fun since I, the one who knows, will be ‚Äòenjoying the ride‚Äô. /s
---
he got lost and fell down so many times, it made a 1-2 hour dungeon take 4 hours. i was amazed how much patience soda was displaying. I would have probably went off on him after the 2nd time he failed the jump.
---
and that shit about being overturned was so funny. i was like your brain's undertuned atm dude go back to sleep you clearly are not awake yet :P
---
If I can't convince my friend to go Alliance it will be undead for me, troll is cool too though...
---
You‚Äôd expect horde to have gotten 30 first then on the beta though, I think we need to see more leveling times from more people on both sides. But rn it‚Äôs pretty crazy to me that the fastest leveler 15 years later took over 20% longer to hit 30. Even if joanas route was just really fast you‚Äôd still expect the fastest people now to be at his time or a bit slower but definitely not over 20% slower.
---
VC? I think you mean DM.
---
It‚Äôs not the same.
---
Personality streamers are few and far between. Most people don‚Äôt get big on twitch because of their personality, they get big because they were high skilled players who grew into their personality(xqc, timthetatman, shroud). I actually can‚Äôt think of any large personality streamers outside of DansGaming, most all of them started by just being high skilled. 
---
I would imagine the hours spent grinding twitch and video games far exceeds the hours gone into training for the NFL. You need a lot of mental discipline to become truly skilled at something you‚Äôre not a born natural at.
---
Point still stands that almost any computer should be able to run this game. And you will not need a super ultra decked out gaming unit to run classic wow.
---
I can't believe I'm actually speaking to someone more autistic than I am.
---
I'll try one more time.
---
If I'm casting cbt and sidestep as I'm doing it, am I losing *ANY* sort of throughput for doing so?
---
Also, saying "in" VC makes no sense at all.
---
"Morally grey"
---
Nice photoshopping skills, bud. Post a video or gtfo.
---
Thank you very much.
---
Does anyone else have info reagrding this?  Ability to chain cast on a priest at 60 versus paladin.  Really don't want to regret having to cast 3 or 4 heals in a row.
---
I don‚Äôt see how an in-house QA team can do better then a live beta test mate. I recall watching a dev interview for a different game and they discussed how ‚Äúno matter how much testing you do pre-release, its very hard to know the game is bug-free. When millions of players begin to do everything you could possibly consider, your inevitably going to find bugs an inhouse team couldn‚Äôt create‚Äù
---
same here i never played it. only had about a year or so on BFA so august is going to be great!
---
You must make a PTR account in account settings
---
You can‚Äôt go and an play professional gaming either. 
---
You can however go out and play amateur football
---
What ?? This Aliance guide is same like  [http://www.oocities.org/iliektosuxit/](http://www.oocities.org/iliektosuxit/)  he only copied  **Brian Kopp's Guide to Leveling 1-60 for Alliance**   and presents it as its own in a new coat
---
The only stuff that is supposed to scale from spell damage are gear procs.
---
Enchantments and items that do a small amount of flat damage weren't supposed to (like nagel ring or those gauntlets that give +3 fire damage per hit), but at some points during vanilla did scale to one direction or another though these were usually fixed once found.
---
However weapons with stuff like the axes with life-stealing proc or that armor that could heal you on proc, those were intended to scale, and should as the scaling wasn't completely removed until like Late TBC or early Wrath.
---
need a scary looking shadow priest pic
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs even close to the context here though.
---
It's sympathetic nostalgia please we've never gotten to experience it LET US FEEL SOMETHING FOR ONCE
---
If I remember well they used a standard amount of armor for mobs they weren't sure of.
---
So some caster boss will have less armor on retail than they had on Pserv but some other boss will have way more armor
---
well I just subbed a hour ago to get a chance at a beta access   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
uuuuh... I was thinking in going as a tank warrior since it was a class I didn't play... now I'm sad :(... warrior will take even more time to level up?
---
Unrealistic assumption: There will be 5 layers when players are high enough level to even think about forming some devilsaur mafia. 
---
Unrealisitc assumption: It'll be easy to switch layers.
---
There you go mate.
---
Classes don't start if you don't go to school.
---
Money. Do you have a plan to afford mount at 40? If so, how? Professions slow down lvling speed but will get you mount faster or is it possible without it?
---
I knew taurens always had a big hitbox, thats a part of their race. What i really would like to know if there is a hitbox difference between male and female.
---
I always just imagine these dudes were in a shitty mood and then see a comment that makes them angrier. 
---
OR the dude went from 0-100 over an internet comment. I can‚Äôt figure out which one is more acceptable.
---
Truer words, truer words.
---
Kargoz is already in the beta
---
Eu acho √© que o grande problema vai ser arranjar Guilds para malta mais kota, e se fossem guilds PT melhor ainda. Mas vamos ver...
---
I think you might've made a mistake it's 101 days 13 hours 24 minutes and 54 seconds now!
---
She actually came in my room and said wtf r u doing
---
Things like black rotus is dynamically spawned, just like other mobs like Lupos. what the spawn timer was thought to be \* 2500/server population. So at 10k everything would spawn 4 times as fast.
---
Yeah, he could have played in vanilla, but that does not mean he's skilled or that he has retained any of the knowledge or skill from that era. He might be the average joe who forgets what it's like after taking almost decade and a half break from the game.
---
Well, tbf, over the years you pick up a lot of 'streamer' skills like presentation, talking to other people, camera skills, post-editing skills etc. Skills that you can easily transfer into 'real' jobs.
---
What is VC, VanCleef?
---
I think it is also a bit naive to sit and say there is no benefit of levelling to the max before starting some more rigorous testing. A part of testing is to play "normal" like you would when it launches. Another benefit of more rigorous testing at the level cap is that there are more spells and potential interactions to test over the amount that exist at level 10 that some others testers are doing.  
---
All testing is beneficial to the developers, this is just salty comments like "I would do a far better job then all these people" - my comment to that: maybe some of you, but most of us including me wouldn't.
---
Am I the only one who never went on twitch before that ?
---
I played OG beta and don't have Classic beta opted in
---
Come at me nerds
---
Also the part where the healer was moonfiring, then trying to heal with regrowth, then calling "I'm oom".
---
Sounds like rage is being calculated internally as out of 1000, and out of 100 is just what it's supposed to be displayed as, and you're seeing real values instead of what's meant to be displayed.
---
Mounts are from level 40, what does that have to do with anything? They're just super slow.
---
Same for me I was bored one day and decided to roll out on a fresh vanilla un documented server. I thought I would be bored with the combat and everything but I was hooked and hit max level and raided with a guild that I became close friends with and will be raiding with in classic. Vanilla wow really is a special experience like none other. People bash on private servers bla bla pirate bla bla bla, but if it wasn‚Äôt for them we wouldn‚Äôt have classic today.
---
yea i like madseasons,  his videos are interesting to watch with good info
---
I can't see this happening. I work in software (granted, not in the gaming industry) and we get "bug reports" similar to this, "x is broken, please fix". 
---
So we look into it, step through code, try and replicate. What we often find is that the user is talking rubbish and doesn't understand the functionality. We don't change the functionality because someone has reported it as "broken", we close the ticket as "no fault found, refer to the user guide".
---
Blizzard have all the data, if they take this bug seriously (spoiler: they wont), they will run it through in debug and find that it is working as intended with no further action.
---
Evidently they couldn't.
---
Iirc, subs are split evenly between the streamer and twitch. So it's $7,500.
---
I just love the idea of shadow orbs procing blackout, And berserking for emergency heals. 
---
I was dwarf before but always wished I was undead,didn‚Äôt know much about trolls then
---
Literally the only two things stopping me from going head first into private server is -
---
1. The lag, being from Australia the ping is minimum 500 and often close to 1000.
---
2. Classics imminent release, I don‚Äôt want to invent to heavily into a character I‚Äôm going to abandon.
---
It's part of the modern client so it's going nowhere.
---
It won't affect you at all.
---
&gt;If I'm casting cbt and sidestep as I'm doing it, am I losing ANY sort of throughput for doing so?
---
If I'm casting vivify to heal the tank and have to move which cancels the cast, am I losing ANY sort of efficiency for doing so?
---
&gt;"literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving."
---
Yep just noticed he got in about 30mins after I posted, edited
---
wait which mainstream streamer has a gambling addiction LOL
---
Madseason is actually quite big, his videos on YT routinely break six digits in viewership.
---
Hi bro. Almost same story here but i am 35 now have a family and a career to care about. I almost cried when saw the announcement LoL. Used to be a serious raider all the way from MC to BWL Naxx AQ Black Temple missed those fun time.
---
I guess there will be plenty of guild taking in people like us. Casual leveling on our own pace. Enjoy both life and classic at the same time.
---
Cross realms battlegrounds confirmed in which is... good?
---
&gt; "I would do a far better job then all these people"
---
I would wanna answer this by saying that I wouldn't want beta access and I also haven't registered for it. There are definitely people who are better suitet for that and that's why I don't wanna take their spot.
---
But are you really telling me that a aoe leveling frostmage, who most probably uses two spells on the exact same mobs over and over again is a good suited beta tester? Sure, that provides some data, but definitely the least possible. 
---
Maybe the guy is waking up today and doing some serious beta testing, who knows. But the truth is that speed leveling a two button class to 30 by aoe grinding is providing little to no data for Blizz.
---
Its other way around. People play retail because of nostalgia.
---
They wont. As they have the exact values, so they can check that its doing the correct damage. Next line in the bug list. But reports arent suggestions, its a list they have to check through. Its not about changing correct values, its about finding if theres wrong values somewhere.
---
Get your tongue out of their ass you sperg.
---
Ahem
---

Carry on.
---
ganking is already the very meaning of having no honor... so what rules could there ever establish :P?
---
WE WANT TO SHOP!!!
---
so much this. why is it even there...
---
but he is telling his follower he is an veteran and knows so a lot of thing from back in the days and and and ...
---
Parents telling kids to go out and play back in the day. I dunno!
---
Is there a tutorial on how to set this up?
---
What are you talking about? Rogues maybe our dps warriors very early in mc, that‚Äôs about it.
---
I'm happy for the people that got in, I wish I had time to join them but I can't, so I didn't even opt-in for the beta. I still think it's a bit of a dick move to hold the beta hostage behind a subscription.
---
I just did, meanwhile I will probably just run some dungeons on retail probably
---
Hey man if you don't want to believe me fine... Makes no difference to me. Just wanted to do the community a favor and stated a fact.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgV6Gk7LfK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgV6Gk7LfK4)
---
Time
---
Dude, I've been ganking WAY before this guy did. Like I came across an alliance level 12 player running through Barrens. Yeah I killed him. Like a whole day before this guy.
---
Title is misleading.
---
It's not a fact unless you post a video you deluded ape.
---
was he saying it jokingly?  no fucking way he would say that seriously, or even think it to himself.
---
He claimed to be the best PvP warrior in NA, like, last night or something.
---
It would be cool if they kept pre-nerf C'thun though, see if anyone can beat it today
---
I started a month before tbc was released sadly. But TBC was a great experience as well.
---
rip mine is from 2008 because I played on my brothers account before =(
---
the thing is. if tbc-c is to happen a couple of decisions need to be made first for tbc-c to be healthy. either the entire server needs to progress to tbc from 1.12.1, or tbc-c realms need to be opened with no allowance for character transfers into. without leveling fresh level 1 characters to 70, the economy will be destroyed in the tbc-c realms. outside of players leveling the new races there won't be enough diversity in the pre-outland content to sustain a healthy experience.
---
ofc not, i am not a retard
---
He has red gear. He charges in without looking behind to see if his party is following. He's not checking his healer's mana. He does not use defensive abilities.
---
"cries in teacher"
---
You need [Wallpaper Engine](https://steamcommunity.com/app/431960), then you just subscribe to wallpapers you like and activate them in the app.
---
My laptop is a hair below retail specs but runs private servers flawlessly. I'm curious to know if I'll be able to comfortably run Classic because on one hand you could argue its the same graphics with a more optimized client, but on the other hand software developers build bloated garbage now because of ever increasing computer tech
---
It's a legit question and you arguing otherwise highlights your *complete lack of knowledge and foresight* on the very thing you have such a strong opinion about. Nerd.
---
&gt;people that don't even stream are getting in. 
---
This is just more glorified PR than a actual beta.
---
It means "Stop reporting these bugs, we know they exist."
---
What was that quest addon with The huge arrows pointing you to where you should go? Zygor or something
---
There are a lot of us ... 36, business owner, family, constantly having to travel during the week.
---
This isn't even a bug, this is pretty accurate.
---
Did you get an e-mail letting you know?
---
How do you center them correctly in Discord?
---
Wait... classic is going to have cross realm battlegrounds? they kind of ruined the community feeling of the battlegrounds :s
---
Isn't this the guy that claimed he played vanilla since it was released?
---
Awe...what about Mr. Small Channel me? :P
---
I see a lot of asks but not a lot of answers.
---
Good old time when we were all gathered on the wide place in front of the AH in Ironforge. This was the only place for the Alliance. Probably my best days in WoW :)
---
Hi, /u/Felandil
---
Not OP but mage is probably the most sought after dungeon dps. Poly and food / water is too good to give up lightly.
---
Because you only have 1 WoW account? Create a trial (starter edition) or PTR account on the same battle.net account and you should see the drop down menu. The menu should appear if you were to get invited to the Classic beta. Although, you would need to restart the battle.net client for it to appear.
---
Kinda sorta.
---
BFA is a slideshow on my potato laptop, but I can run the beta at almost full high settings with a good frame rate.
---
Just throwing the info related to your comment
---
Funny how people can be so gullible.
---
When he got all the subs at the end that had to be up there in top 5 or 10 with most subs in short amount of time
---
yeah i forget the arrow was first in an addon called tomtom i think
---
You're right, maybe it doesn't give the most amount of data. However, a lot of people that are watching and commenting on all forums, twitch chat etc. Act like this beta will only be up for this week only and that it is doomsday that people are not trying their "hardest" to break the game.
---
There might be valid data from this type of testing this mage did. Maybe mobs are spawning faster than their supposed spawn times or that the leech of and timer of mobs the following mage before they lose aggro is to long. Who knows... However, now that this person have completed the objective of levelling. Hopefully, more testing will be done, we shall see.
---
Also thank you for not getting all aggro in your response, some people on this Reddit are very defensive and rude
---
&gt;And i was wondering if the hp regen out of combat isn't a bit too high ?
---
Maybe hes stacking +spirit ( i know most ppl avoided it like a plague in vanilla, example warriors ). You mean PER tic or is the tic rate too fast ? Didnt pay attention to that.
---
Its super high at the early levels anyways and becomes much less in endgame.
---
They were cross realm in 12.1
---
Its a double edged sword imo
---
On one hand you aren't building those rivalries by going against the same faction opposition consistently. On the other, queues are going to be much shorter and premade pvp groups basically had it down to a science at that point anyways with queue dodging and what not.
---
I'll never play that but you don't know yet, it could make tons of bank over in China.
---
Man, I just booked a weeks holiday from work to stay with/above the curve when levelling. I'll be incredibly salty if my time is spent looking at a login screen waiting for the server to come back up all the time :(
---
Just got a little bit of anxiety thinking about it!
---
I purposely didn‚Äôt unsubscribe for that exact chance and then realised you needed to opt in for ‚Äúclassic wow beta‚Äù when I was only opted for wow beta smh my head
---
Where is that Quote from Captain? All I remember was "You Need to have an active subscription in order to participate in the beta" which could mean both - but since OP got in I¬¥m quite certain that you only Need the Sub in order to get in - not to be selected
---
I might be asking a stupid question here, but why would he know about undead rogues? He's a gnome mage.
---
He's not the final boss tho. The murloc is.
---
There is no debate and Ventuki is not familiar with niche speed leveling min/max. Mage aoe leveling is hands down the fastest way to level in vanilla if you are able to farm freely (that‚Äôs the kicker). It‚Äôs widely accepted by speed runners to begin aoe farming @ 16. But to reiterate, very few people will be able to viably aoe level on launch.
---
Good to know. Thanks a lot for this information
---
Getting best applicants should not be decided by a roll after paying them 15 dollars. People have it twisted in their classic hype. Imagine any other company looking for people that would PAY THE COMPANY money so the people can possibly get a chance to get in a queue to give feedback on their new test product.
---
Yeah I don't even remember ever seeing "VC" at all. This was in EU around 2006
---
I don't understand thinking that the pservers will be more accurate then classic. Don't they have a server (can't remember the correct name) from vanilla that they were working with while remaking the game?
---
Just plebs acting like plebs. You‚Äôll love it.
---
They aren't doing stress tests yet. When they decide to do stress tests it'll most likely be an open beta (they'll probably open it up to test the layering system in a month or two so any unforseen major issues can be ironed out before launch).
---
Right now they're still working on a closed beta that is part publicity stunt/part feedback collection
---
It would actually be fun to watch a stream of a 'bad' player with a good sense of humor blundering his way into vanilla creating all kinds of joke situations.
---
I've been watching Crendor playing, he doesn't pretend to know what he's doing. 
---
So far I've watched him level fishing with Jesse Cox in Durotar, and he took his level 9 Orc hunter to STV on a whim, trying to explore his way up to level 10. He managed to get all of Elwyn Forest discovered and yelled at some alliance. He died a lot. 
---
This is the kind of play-style that I remember in vanilla, and I love it.
---
u gucci, u have game time/sub u have a chance.
---
Platinum WoW deserves an invite!
---
This isn't true at all, I regularly talk about how certain things were bugged on private servers and NOT how it worked in original Vanilla. This is the exact opposite of what I've been saying since I used to stream private servers before my ban.
---
You can use this link to check when your account was created too.
---
https://blizzard.com/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html
---
Theres a lot more streams
---
ADZ Show me where Blizzard states that you Need a Sub in order to be selected for the beta. The way they stated it it could mean both - and I believe OP that he got it without a Sub and I also believe that you can only get in with a running Sub. So you do Need one to Play - but not to be selected. 
---
Prove me wrong ADZ you confused cow
---
If you've played private servers to practice leveling routes, can you comment on how the /played and xp gains was compared to whichever server you played on?
---
The most popular Dun Morogh starting area route for 1-10 is around 1hr 20-30 min played time. Just wondering if all my preparation on P.servers and the /played results will even be close to what the real thing will be.
---
Also were spawns slow compared to P.servers?
---
Sooo, did anyone get an invite without having an active sub?
---
(I'm not asking about being able to play without an active sub, just getting an invitation!)
---
Nothing wrong with being bad bro, it‚Äôs a game. It‚Äôs meant to be enjoyed.
---
Account creation date November 2004 - No invite granted I haven‚Äôt been subbed since 2013 though.
---
depends on the addons that will actually be added. Personally, I'd only use DMG\_reccount, Bartender (something so easily set up hotkeys) and probably a questhelper
---
Nerds that didn't play won't understand. Those that give it a try will.
---
If you like seeing the fruits of your labor and becoming a force to be reckoned with based on how much you know ratio'd with how much time you put in you'll like Classic. Epics are hard earned and one wrong move is the difference between dying and victory if you play on a pvp server WHICH YOU SHOULD
---
Blizzard has been pretty good recently at releasing games smoothly. Launch night might have some issues but i dont think it will be too bad.
---
Its a nice push but the future of the game comes down how good the game is in the long run. There where plenty of games that where suprisingly super popular for up to a month and then got down pretty hard or even "died". Lawbreaker had in 2017 around 50k views on Twitch and not even a year later the game had barely anyone playing. Apex Legends had even 600k+ Viewers and now did drop (still around and living well but still), Maplestory 2 had a nice hype and 32k views on Twitch and now the games barely 1000 players on. 
---
We have to see. Of course i think Classic will be super popular for a longer time, but seeing how popular the beta is says nothing.
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/LittleDiligentRedpandaBibleThump](https://clips.twitch.tv/LittleDiligentRedpandaBibleThump)
---
It doesn't. Still it makes finding groups a bit more comfortable I guess
---
Who is Joe Pera?
---
I thought the beta is maxed out at L30 ? Thats why ppl were racing to it.
---
Really hope they can make a mobileversion too, enjoyed classic wow alot, but i just don't have the time to grind nowdays.
---
Guy is clearly having a lot of fun, good on him.
---
Oh really? Didn't know that. I've been preparing on private server trying to figure this question out.
---
1.9
---
I thought it might be but the first time I fired up a private server it gripped me all over again, and even a friend that doesn't fall to nostalgia traps said the same and that there's something special about it
---
Why should I get aggro over a constructive comment? You do have a point.
---
I'll give you the spawn times, that's something that will be tested by this method. On the other hand, and now I'm speculating, I don't really think that he payed attention to that. It would even be in his favor if the mobs respawned faster as he clearly wanted to reach 30 asap.
---
But let's see how it evolves. You're right saying that it's only the first week of the beta. But as I'm working in software development myself (not gaming though), I know that there are issues that are not fixed within a few days and every issue found early will give us and Blizz a smoother release. That's why I think the beta, especially in these early days, should be used for play testing for the most part. In the last weeks prior to release you can still speed level or do whatever you want as by then the majority of the bugs should already be fixed.
---
Cheers mate
---
So this guy talks about shieldless tanking and people still think hes smart?
---
If you are human you deal way more dmg with combat sword spec, If you are a other race you deal more dmg with combat swords. PVP is quite versatile though
---
Interested to find out - scanning on private servers is 45mins of making sure you're not AFK'd out.
---
I think it was a thing a couple of months ago to just spend a bunch of money on online casinos on stream. Dont know if it is still popular though.
---
You people don't bother reading notes from blues, do you?

Your contributions are greatly appreciated friend.

On my NA realm, I always called Deadmines DM. One day I was leveling an alt and saw a group in chat LF1M DM so asked for an invite. My level 18 joined a party of 60s. After that I adopted using VC.
---
the ping to EU private servers is 300-350ms from nsw.
---
whether its worth it this close to classic idk.
---
When someone says DM they always mean deadmines. I find the whole VC thing silly since when people run dire maul they say dme, dmw, dmn, or tribute, never just DM.
---
The ping to borthbale is 500-1000 in nsw with NBN FTTP.
---
I'm sorry who?
---
Getting older as an Fastpaced game fan can feel devastating :D 
---
Especial shooter. Its kinda easyer to get back into Fighting games.
---
think it is meant to, it could be to do with how the spells tick i know they have tweaked it to give casters that more authentic feel but may have caused issues with traps and other things
---
He genuinely did, when he had broken gear
---
the gates wouldn't be open, they would be OPENABLE.
---
Gates weren't auto-opened until WRATH.
---
makes AMA ... didnt anwser
---
You just played yourself :O It doesn¬¥t even say you Need a subscription in order to be eligable to be Chosen xD
---
It just says you Need a Sub - it doesn¬¥t specify if you Need it to be Chosen or in order to Login...
---
Sorry m8
---
Yeah, that isn't getting much. /s
---
Why was the clip removed?
---
Game is broken
---
The g603 has a 500 hour battery life, and latency on par (and in some test better then) with wired mice.
---
Its for a good reason many pro csgo players started using wireless logitech mice.
---
Same here. What a waste of BfA development time!
---
I'll take my 100$ and see you all in August.
---
You're fucking dense, m8
---
Tipsdown Baby! No literally, he fall down again...
---
1. Have you played 30 hours straight with no sleep?
---
2. Do you have a job? Have you taken time off jus to play Beta?
---
3. Have you played on classic private servers recently?
---
4. Have you reported any bugs? If not did you write them down for later?
---
5. Are you currently playing on retail? What kind of player are you - Mythic Raider/Casual Raider/M+/Arenas?
---
Tamb√©m ainda n√£o encontrei nenhuma, nem comunidade. 
---
Vou com mais 2 amigos na alliance
---
no doubt, all the old vanilla wow pvp videos with all these old metal/rock songs bringing back my child hood lol.
---
He probably means "lack of nowadays -yet old- races like bloodelves, draenei, ..." Not missing race for classic, but for WoW as we know today
---
Classic will be easier in some ways and much harder in others. Most private server creatures don't have any abilities, and have standardized armor and resistances, ending up much less lethal than they are in the beta.
---
You're right now that i think about it
---
I would say that Mortal Kombat is the best game movie out there, sure it's old and isn't as flashy as Warcraft, but the story is there. Might just be the nostalgia in me, I haven't seen the movie in some years now.
---
Warcraft was a marvel to behold, from Goldshire to Stormwind, the orcs were amazingly made, just overall the visuals were really good. The story was meh but what I hated the most was the human cast. I think they chose the absolutely worst actors for the human roles, and this comes from someone who is a fan of Travis Fimmel and Dominic Cooper. I don't know if the issue was the movie itself that made them not fit their roles or they were just not meant to be good for them but my God, I never felt so detached from some characters, especially characters that I know about from a franchise that I love.
---
Could be worse I suppose, before seeing these comments about video game movies I completely forgot Assassin's Creed the movie was a thing.
---
If you are only going for gold, solo farming Mara and/or selling Princess runs might be a good avenue for you as well.
---
Enjoy life being willfully ignorant.
---
100 % agree
---
Wrong, just learn to time your cone of cold until blizzard slow falls off.
---
Blizzard also does more dmg with 3/3 due to the mobs actually walking through all the ticks.
---
People that recommend 2/3 imp.BLizzard dont know what they are talking about.
---
Anything else kid? There's the video to prove you wrong again. So yes it is a fact 
---
[https://youtu.be/mgnG92jycro](https://youtu.be/mgnG92jycro)
---
Shadowmeld is an amazing quality of life racial and people really acknowledge that for the most part unless they're bantering casual race superiority or if they're just weird and sad. Fear Ward is cool and all but all it does is prevent the tank from sleeping at the wheel while tanking and a 10% stat stick isnt gamebreaking by any means- I don't remember the math I did while playing on private servers but comparing it to the gnome racial, which is 5% int, that is only a 1% dps increase for casters.
---
DM*
---
To be fair.. he did play. Quite a bit on private servers.
---
Sounds like someone's just mad they didn't get access. Take a breather.
---
Hey grats man! Hope you enjoy your time in the beta! 
---
That's interesting that you got an invite with a 2006 date, I had only seen one or two posts saying they got in with a 2005 sub date and everyone else was 2004 so I assumed later years were out of the question at least for a couple weeks. Do you have any hookups that got you in or just a random invite? 
---
Grats again!
---
Is everyone still complaining about streamers?  Was hoping that died down.
---
Except Blizzard will just compare it to their 1.12 client and say "It works exactly as it did back then, deal with it." like they have for everything else so far.
---
Monkeynews
---
Why is an hour a level unreasonable?
---
Well, to be fair those testers are much more needed than some of the streamers who try to shill on Classic by streaming it, don't care for reporting any of the bugs and just use it as a means of propagating their channel.
---
Game Revolution article since I couldn‚Äôt get the blue post to load. Also Staysafe, Tipsout, and Estvan all stated the same during each of their live streams.
---
dunno why your getting that high ping.
---
ive raided on multiple private servers with aus/nz guilds and most ppl get 300-350
---
Proof?
---
I predict a lot of players on release (over a million easily, but half a million for sure). And than around 300k stable population. But at least 200k.
---
I even added a photo editing tab in the video. pay close attention now
---
I missed a word, let me clarify, gonna edit for clarity
---
Congrats Dude! Can you tell if Arcane Concentration can proc on every tick of AM or only on the cast?
---
Are you in aus/nz?
---
So it looks like they are releasing small waves of invites per day then?
---
Sounds like somebody's making baseless assumptions because they can't deal with irrefutable harsh truths. Keep grasping at straws, kid.
---
Yeah Joana was struggling in the starter zone a few hours ago with the beta expanding
---
People have posted that they got invites without owning BFA and that they were not content creators of any kind, so it is confirmed possible.
---
Fair speculation, could potentially be true. Some people do want to find things for their personal gains. However, I believe that this AOE testing will be tested thoroughly by others during the continuation of the BETA. 
---
I do agree with you that focussing on the testing early on is very important as it might become less and less the focus in the ladder stages of the BETA. On the flip side... I see that there actually is a benefit having these people that streams and Reddit consider "useless for testing or "less fitting". My reasoning for this is that people watching are looking so closely, taking clips of moments that they are feeling in question about, getting riled up and let's call it "critiquing" whilst I would call it patronising or flaming these people with their knowledge. 
---
All these different aspects are fuelling the end results I would be surprised if Blizzard is using BoW and AI on twitch chats as well for these testing.
---
cheers
---
Did they leave the Skill Leveling in? Like One Handed Weapons or Wands?
---
yep. was in sydney. now mid north coast
---
Guild with 58 members ready to go. :D
---
You realize that traps took time to activate in vanilla right? They weren‚Äôt instant.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you were patting yourself on your back. When he did get the charge on you you played pretty bad.
---
If a hunter gets the drop on most people he can easily 1vX them at low levels.
---
doesnt make him a knowledgeable person. I never understood why people think that streamers have some kind of magical knowledge and skill.
---
Lol :O ADZ124 are you literally 15 and about to experience Classic for the first time? xD The way you act you seem to be... I envy you being able to experience it first time.
---
But I remain with my Position - and when the Point is proven I will be digging out These comments and give you the biggest "didn¬¥t I say so" you ever got xD
---
Now back to your insults plss
---
Are you genuinely this obtuse, lil timmy? This doesn't prove anything because you're NOT PLAYING. Why is that a hard concept to grasp?
---
someone is a bit jealous eh?
---
Please give some evidence so I can have hope that I might still get in.
---
Of the almost 100,000 people in the reddit you being the only person to state that this happened is an abnormality. You don‚Äôt make a rule based on an outlier. So it still stands that you need a subscription to be selected. You may have happened to be a hole in the system, or you‚Äôre bullshitting. In either instance Blizzard and every major streamer that went to the meeting with Blizz said the same thing and that is you need a sub to even be considered.
---
It would be annoying if he QQ about most hard boss fights in the Classic beta and they ended up nerfing the damage for launch..
---
Haha Brewer I love you :D Show this kid that he is wrong af xD 
---
funny :)
---
Thanks for the PSA btw!
---
Joana is a legend. As a Hunter Main who used his guides for a lot of stuff he really deserves it.
---
I've got no love for Tips but I've only ever played Alliance back in the day and on 2 PServers. Pretty sure I'd get lost in WC too
---
toxic af
---
death threats aren't funny, or a fucking meme. don't want someone to call the police about a death threat, then don't make the threat. None of these streamers/youtubers know if the people making these comments represent a real threat or not. This is some de-humanizing shit, even when it is some edgy kids who don't realise that its a real person who's reading that comment.
---
I don't watch tips, or most of these new streamers, but this sort of activity makes the classic community look like shit
---
I've seen it a lot these past few days. It's like people need someone to blame for something and I don't understand it. I could perhaps understand some of the views regarding people such as Towelliee that doesn't give a shit about Classic and talked against it before it blew up, but people like Tips? I don't know man, he's been advocating for Classic since it was announced and made content for it ever since.
---
While he might not actually really know what he is talking about a lot of the times, at least it seems that he genuinely does care about Classic, even if he didn't actually play it originally or is the best player in the world. I certainly don't think people are being very reasonable by shit talking him to this extent because of his lack of knowledge and at times incorrect information.
---
Key word: streamer
---
99% of people have not played for 15 years, or anywhere close to it.
---
The amount of good players in retail is the exact same as the amount of good people back then. 
---
Retail is entirely different from classic, game mechanics and all.
---
The people who played WoW back then were **gamers**. We spent hours and hours on the game.   
---
This idea we were all noobs who didn't know what gaming was is *preposterous*.
---
People are trying to start their streaming careers and this is about as good of an opportunity as some will ever get.
---
Dude, nice!!
---
The official statement in a interview still is there will not be multiply world bosses and rare spawns so your still just making statements for what if..
---
just hang in man I don't think this will happen.
---
I think that only happened to female tauren, though.
---
More baseless assumptions. Congratz on being willfully ignorant and congratz on your inability to form an argument. You're definitely going places in life.
---
The projections aren't a good either you mongoloid.
---
Yea i'm starting to think that may be the case lol. I thought it was unknown if you did in fact have to be subbed because what I have read and heard from other streamers it was unclear. Maybe I got the beta in an unusual way.
---
Opened my launcher when I got home from work. got an invite as well. account active since December '04 I believe?
---
I had lost hope on an invite already. Don't. seems they are continuing to send them out.
---
I truelly wish they would drop #nochanges for 1 little AH change: You may not post more than let's say 20 items in total on the AH.... No more 3 pages of 1 iron bar, but just good old 20 bar stacks like in vanilla, before people found out 20 times 1 bar apparently makes more profit...
---
&gt; If I'm casting vivify to heal the tank and have to move which cancels the cast, am I losing ANY sort of efficiency for doing so?
---
Yes, you are, but how does that take away from the fact you could've moved while casting your mists or ef?
---
first, again, nobody is min maxing in freakin wc. then, red gear is actually something he might ve learned from some really good warriors. i saw monkeynews not repairing his gear he said its just not worth it. hes just aiming for getting new gear. maybe that was his shot at it. can we just not judge players skill based on some half assed content?
---
That's correct.  No emails or anything.  Just refresh your bnet launcher and cross your fingers.
---
I can't stand Alex, he had a golden opportunity a few years back to become a massive name in the Vanilla community and instead opted to let his ego take over and rage about how other youtubers and streamers were moving into "his market" and how he was the face of classic WoW.
---
He's called the project dead on countless occasions, as little as 2 days ago and is another one of the "I'm a vanilla veteran" youtubers that didn't even play Vanilla.
---
But i will always love the level 17 hunters OP meme.
---
If you've only played "bad" how can you know what "good" is? ;)
---
Lots of people are afraid classic will kill the little life remaining in retail. Don't listen to them, form your own opinion.
---
Is too many greens dropping? Watching streams and it seems like greens drop every minute in instances at least.
---
B-b-but pet battles
---
He looks like he needs some sleep
---
Two things Lahey.
---
Put on some fuckin' pants.  And fuck off.
---
Back in Dark Age of Camelot there was some guy (also allegedly oil rich Arab) who would pay 8v8 groups to carry him (i.e. play 7v8 with him as mostly dead weight). Paid something like $100 per fight won. It was decent money the first few nights, but then the other groups started teaming up and would zerg the group that was currently carrying him.
---
The tooltip  says 
---
&gt; ... if the target is killed **by you** while you drain its soul ...
---
It is only meant to proc if you get the killing blow, if pet or someone else gets it you don't get the proc.
---
LFR was the end of Cata.
---
So having the account created and playing at launch does not give you a certain invite, too bad for me but happy for you other guys :D
---
You're both autistic. Wouldn't surprise me if you're both the same person tbf. Pathetic.
---
I guess you could say your guild always had bad lighting in your raids.
---
WotLK had the highest number of players.
---
That's actually very interesting. Does this mean all of the races have if only slightly different melee ranges? If that's the case, that's actually pretty cool, since it adds a bit to the D&amp;D style of RPGs where character sice actually matters: Larger creatures = longer limbs = longer reach.
---
Beta is currently capped at level 30. No idea when the beta will close.
---
Its not a addon or anything, it used to be the base combat text used in WoW. It was changed after/during MoP I **think** and now limits the size and placement of the combat text, and its horrible.
---
Really appreciate it, I felt pathetic actually thinking about subbing for a chance.
---
I watched a compilation video yesterday and it has Tipsout falling and Sodapoppin getting very fed up with him lol
---
https://youtu.be/4rqsTv0DJe8
---
Really makes you question his ability
---
Yea there was an addon we would use to all Single queue so we don't go against another premade and just accept the certain number that popped up.
---
Nice fake.
---
-ADZ124_ probably
---
I completely agree with you. My point was more aimed at those who are complaining about streamers getting invites first. Even if interest on Twitch does die down, it's still put Classic into the mind of many people who might not have had a look.
---
So when the ancient leaf you will pass on it as a dwarf hunter ?
---
F
---
How come it doesn't list verdan doing too much damage?
---
Imagine being this desperate for attention. Sad life... 
---
If you're not in-game and playing the beta then there's nothing to discuss because your whole argument is hurr durr -  *"Just am trying to save everyone's hard earned money. "*
---
I played a lot of IIDX before WoW consumed me.
---
I mean, lets be honest. That whole crew are kind of full of shit, we've always knew it. You can act the part but when it comes time to play, we all know you were a noob in vanilla WoW Tips.
---
Finally easymode
---
&gt;  in VC.
---
It's DM, my dudes.
---
And no, DM isn't 'Dire Maul', because Dire Maul has 3 wings. If you want Dire Maul you say DMW/E/N based on the wing.
---
I highly recommend not using any guides, questing or otherwise.
---
Just take your time and you'll have experiences and fun you couldn't have otherwise.
---
&gt;or everything will inflate endlessly, like retail
---
That's a very broad statement to purport as fact. Especially when the current state of WoW kinda shows the opposite.
---
Current WoW expansion is DEFLATIONARY and heavily so. They did not achieve this by re-adding single spec + a gold cost.
---
The main reason WoW inflated so much over time was increasing rewards from things such as garrison / mission table which were largely passive and free gold which people obtained on mass alts etc.
---
Furthermore, even if this weren't true you're completely ignoring the fact that its not a zero sum game.
---
They could add dual spec but make it expensive. A one time big purchase in addition to the current system.
---
You could argue that some people will spend far more respeccing and so dual spec is not appropriate as it wont remove as much gold - but I'd argue that its also likely that many people will buy dual spec who would otherwise never spend that amount of gold on respecs.
---
There are many facets to it. Personally I dont believe that the respec cost is a gold sink of actual real influence in the game. And it's certainly something that could be offset even with dual spec etc being added.
---
Staysafe said 2 months but i dont know where he got this info
---
Lmao
---
haaha no
---
I'm only downvoting you because you said le sigh and I have no idea how many layers of irony there are but it still hurts
---
Alright fair enough.
---
If you take a 2004-06 computer I bet it wouldn‚Äôt get 5fps on the lowest settings.

Any healer who doesn't dps is a bad healer.

Why are you an overpowered mage and why didn't you roll cool guy priest like me?

If you have 50 golds at lvl 43, you're still on foot ! And if you buy that cleaver you're gonna still be on foot for a long time \^\^
---
I had 1 gold left at lvl 40 after buying my mount back in Vanilla (and I was a skinner) !
---
lolol man sorry to say but you gotta take a look at yourself. You're going off on a subreddit demanding more and more each chance I prove you wrong. It says a lot about your character and shows your age. So yea Sad life man I feel sorry for you I truly do lol I think this is YOUR desperate take for attention. This is probably the most you got all week. So hey spotlights on you champ! Hold onto it as long as you can buddy! We see you !
---
SW_Stats yo!
---
We used to distinguish between PvP and PK (Player Killing). PvP is when you have a fair fight to prove your skill, PK is when you just indiscriminately kill everyone you can for shits and giggles.

My server even had zones for either "mode". In Felwood and Winterspring you were expected to show some degree of sportsmanship: no adding, no consumables, no engineering, etc. Everywhere else was just a gankfest.
---
I don't think this is a bug/error. 
---
A lot of the greens are average/trash/cheap vendor trash and for disenchantment purposes.
---
June 2005 according to that then. I‚Äôm in EU and I was a few months late from launch so that‚Äôd make sense!
---
oh, didn't know that.
---
In that case, the population was so low because of the time he streamed (9AM utc+2 , so in the morning on a thursday)
---
More irony and projections.
---
Wait wait.. so because he got level 30 in Classic beta, he somehow is interesting to watch?
---
Sorry, I'll need more than an incentive than that.
---
In other news, I just got my apartment first stacking 30 oranges. Come check out my stream bruh
---
look even when I meet his demands and prove him wrong this kid has nothing to say LMAO cute you got your attention champ no gtfo lol
---
Are dungeon mobs doing too low damage?
---
Entertaining? Maybe, if you like fake people. That entire crew are fakes. At least be honest about your shit, especially when Blizzard is giving you the opportunity to Beta test the game before others. We all know he didnt play vanilla when it was out. Popularity doesn't always equate to truth.  He is in it for one thing. Money.
---

July 5th 2006 :)
---
I literally cannot tell if you are serious or sarcastic.
---
Blizzard wouldn't want to interrupt your important work.
---
Same, but I'm currently subbed, although I don't have the latest addon.
---
VC was a name eventually people started using. You can still call it DM if someone is smart enough to just shift click your name to see your level. Obviously a level 60 would mean DireMaul etc.
---
I have an account since March 2015 and I'm not in.
---
I downvoted because they downvoted. Have the dagger 1 cm deeper my friend, on me!
---
I don't think people have an issue with his skills. I think people have an issue because a guy who submits a bug that a 5-man boss does "too much damage" when they were obviously unprepared for the fight got a chance into the closed beta, and people with much more knowledge that could actually help with feedback did not.
---
lol gottem. Later
---
There is nothing wrong classic/vanilla, but there is plenty wrong with the attitude of modern wow audience. The audience that slowly changed wow from how it was.
---
The argument for nostalgia being the reason for classic success faded as soon as i hit my first ever 60 alliance character after playing nonstop horde. It felt like a whole different classic experience to me and was just as beautiful. Its the gameplay 100%. So many nuances feel exactly right for an MMO which you dont even consciously pick up while playing.
---
I keep seeing this pop up? Why does the year matter?
---
Nah Soda has a ton of experience on Vanilla druids, he's been playing private servers offstream for a couple of years now.
---
In terms of mainstream content creators that were most pumped for Classic Soda has to be at the top, he's consistently lost income to be able to play the game and is one of the biggest indicators of Classic being legitimately good on its own merits.
---
Upvoted for Randy's Newfie accent.
---
No one will hate. Don't be silly. Healers get a red carpet treatment
---
I played earlier than 2009 (which was when I was able to afford my own account) but the account I used was my uncle's :'(... Ahhh the nostalgic days as an elementary kid....
---
Yup, so far it looks like EU / NA Streamers, and a few random NA players. Havn't seen any "normal" EU people with beta so far
---
What Can we learn from an aoe farmer? Nothing.
---
The fact that streamers/youtubers are creating content about other streamers, thats what he means.
---
Feels bad not being in beta huh?
---
The lack of EU players in the beta is annoying, like the release dates EU getting fucked over again..
---
The weak should fear the strong.
---
You will not get rejected for playing NE Priest.
---
Yeah, I have no idea what that dude is talking about. I watched your stream all day and, not only were you right about the mechanics 99% of the time, but you never act like you‚Äôre right if you‚Äôre not sure about something.
---
Part of the reason I chose to watch your stream was because you weren‚Äôt spreading incorrect info like some of the other streamers have been.
---
Yeah but now we have a chance to finally *answer* the question ;)
---
nothing wrong with it but its quite different from current wow and not for everyone.
---
Can we just appreciate how he dings the EXACT moment the chorus hits
---
"hurrrrrr durrrrr I've played since alpha and I don't have an invite hurr durrrrr"
---
Am I doing this right?
---
Funny that blizzard are now promoting gambling by this.
---
The release date/time is exactly the same time globally, the difference you see is due to time zones
---
Yes midnight on a Tuesday is not a great time but I really don‚Äôt see how the will deter the ultra hardcore for who a different release time could be a real issue
---
Speaking of druids, has anyone tested whether the infamous [Feral Range Bug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJUr-IRhLLc) is back 
---
in Classic?
---
Or any variant of the mouse bug (mouse cursor randomly jumping to the center of the screen when clicking)?
---
Unlikely to happen. Remember they have the database in tact. The data will be as it was in 1.12. A bug on the beta would be if numbers from the beta not aligning with the 1.12 data.
---
Got a link? Also, was it not that fatty I whos name I can't remember also talking A LOT of shit regarding classic, and just now he's changing his behaviour around?
---
Av and wsg aren't out until phase 3.
---
I love all the salty Asmon/Eafand fanboy comments and downvotes. "what about when they killed you?", "it's so ez to 1vX as hunter", "you played so bad when he charged at you" etc.
---
Good job man. Loving it.
---
art imitates life
---
As recent as yesterday (or the day before) he said he was in the absolute top of NA warriors when it comes to dueling. I can find the clip if you want me to. 
---
I don't really care about him either way but he is fake as F.
---
Ion Hazikostas is smart. That is one thing we can count on. Also another thing we can count on is he is keeping an eye on this thread. He's most likely laughing along with us. I wouldn't worry too much about changes because of some noob streamer :)
---
Thanks for confirming my theory you N.E.E.T :)
---
It could be. If they see huge success in the classic model they may move retail back in that direction
---
Not really, jumping underwater was always a leftover from the old movement system that was remade during wotlk. It's already common knowledge at this point that blizzard decided to use the beta for azeroth engine for classic, so it really doesn't take more than average IQ, which /u/Pandaboots seems to lack, to connect the dots and understand that some things like fluent movement, more grass, different lighting comes with it.
---
I think little mans mad because he subbed 6 months to blizzard in hope they'd flag his account with beta lmao feels bad
---
I would also like to know, same boat started in 05 but acct history only goes to 2010 on new bnet site
---
Yup. I first saw Asmongold viedeos in mid 2014 (as a warrior main, this [hit me hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hc-JNhwdnE). Just take a look at how many videos he made before that. And he only started exploding in sub numbers when his (fun) guides were posted on the /r/wow sub.
---
If I was a developer on WoW I'd take his opinion over so many others, since he's played WoW so much every expac. A few weeks ago he even hit the 30k achievement points, which means that have to do almost everything ingame to even get there.
---
Those are the only people I follow and none of them got Beta.
---
Nah it's possible to get both.
---
Mount is a bigger priority.
---
&gt;Yes, you are, but how does that take away from the fact you could've moved while casting your mists or ef?
---
Mists is not a heal of any note. It's something you keep up as a buff on a player. Putting a hot that ticks for like 1-2k isn't of consequence - and its likely to already be on the tank. Thus recasting it is also sub optimal. EF is something you don't want to use randomly as it is both prohibitively expensive to do so and extremely inefficient both in mana and heal. If your goal is to heal the tank then casting EF and hitting them for like 6k with 1 bolt of EF for 8k mana isn't going to work.
---
SO by your own omission, it is a performance LOSS to have to move and not be able to cast your only spammable heal that does direct healing of any consequence.
---
The only instant casts you have do not fill the same role and so are not interchangable. On top of that it is HIGHLY inefficient to just use EF for the sake of it f.e.
---
Also, and please don't get overwhelmed by this, I explained before that just because you have an ability that can be used while moving that doesn't make it inherently free to use. Especially with how encounters are FAR more tightly tuned now.
---
In the case of EF for example, you HAVE to have it for encounter mechanics where the raid takes significant damage from a mechanic. Not having it up because you used it as a crutch for a movement mechanic prior can be absolutely devastating in terms of efficiency. 
---
To that effect, you are generally NOT able to cast EF (your only castable spell while moving) as a MW monk f.e just because you happen to need to move. 
---
You WILL have lots of times where you can't cast etc due to movement. And any fights that require further movement - especially if you are assigned to do a mechanic that requires more movement - lead to even further performance losses.

Yeah, I watch his streams occasionally and find him pretty entertaining. I enjoyed watching some of his Deadmines stream. Good luck to him, at the end of the day he's not everybody's cup of tea but a lot of people enjoy it.

Re-sticky the beta bug megathread.
---
I downvoted because those guys downvotes.
---
Read the comment I'm replying to, Einstein.
---
More power to you! See you in August!
---
I can‚Äôt recall ever using regrowth in vanilla during an instance/raid. Just had the top 4 ranks of healing touch, top 2 ranks of rejuv, and a decursive macro.
---
Sure, why not? 
---
(Obama was the best!)
---
I agree. That is something that I had problem with in retail for quite some time. Back in classic I remember being proud of myself achiving personal biggest crits. That way I knew that my character is getting much stronger with each item replaced during leveling. Crits sticked longer and were much more noticable than now.
---
Currently in retail I don't even know if I'm stronger or not with my dmg output after changing items. Partial blame for that is that there are too many things hitting my target than ever before so it's hard to distinguish each spell. But on top of that dmg text output is now different.
---
I'm really looking forward for that to change. For me it is important, as this is what I remembered a lot back from the days. Would love to again be excited for each personal biggest crits during lvling and after.
---
I made my character to look like my character, not what you see on your screen.
---
A huge amount of subs comes from twitch prime, which is a free twitch sub you get to choose to spend on every month as long as you have Amazon prime and both accounts connected. I, for example, give my sub to Preach every month and it doesn't cost me anything.
---
I know we all agree to no balancing changes in classic, but if we want a true blizzlike experience we should have blue posts every week detailing how shamans have been nerfed again
---
You are clearly remembering spellcasting mechanics.
---
\- Spell miss cannot be lower than 1%
---
\- 4 levels of difference would indeed give almost  1/3 chance to miss (28%)

Yep, although it was also interesting to try out retail since it's been a while.
---
It's *gaaaarrbaaagggeee*
---
Very nice. Thank you!
---
Don't worry, combat is slow enough to allow for that.
---
Especially if you play a paladin.
---
Idk why, I did a speed test and I‚Äôm 30 down and 15 up and getting 300-400 average and spikes near 1000.
---
12. Feb 2005 EU here (till 2008) ... no invite
---
Its ok, would be nice to have beta access.
---
But i'm not crying... game will be re-released in August. Means ... soon!
---
Holy entitlement LOL. Just to kind of burst your bubble a bit I have played games all my life (Im 22 now) and I have never played or watched a video of WoW until I was 19.
---
The WoW hype didn't reach my city (I am living in a first world country) at all and no one was playing WoW even in its glory days.
---
To think that kids and teenagers nowadays know about WoW/Classic is so entitled and frankly delusional.
---
Interesting. An AMA where op doesnt respond to questions.
---
Haha I love how you always say willfully ignorant and I¬¥m not able to argue. 
---
You are the one throwing insults left and right - we have given you plenty of proof and you are still being "willfully ignorant" :P
---
I already made it in life tbh believe it or not - I don¬¥t Need to Project on you :D I¬¥m stand above that.
---
But srsly... How can you not just admit you were wrong? xD Is it that hard for you? ;)
---
does it increases the max distance of the range weapon ?
---
All you have to do is cast frost shock to win.
---
the fuck? are we crying for some minor youtubers to get into the beta? 
---
i like these guys as much as the next, but can we fucking stop this ‚Äúwe need to push‚Äù shit, posts literally begging Blizz?
---
The thing is the rogue can just stealth/avoid you until he's ready. And there's nothing you can do about it. Shadow priests can reduce the damage significantly, but once their inner fire is gone (you pop slice n dice and just auto attack it down during the first rotation), you can 100-0 them in the next cs-&gt;ks combo.
---
You need to learn the skill of understanding sarcasm mate.

Doesn't hot tank

That moment when you realize this exact post had more upvotes on the retail wow subreddit. But yea, take any chance to say fuck retail right?
---
he was only here for the bragging
---
Is clearcasting nerfed or buffed? Meaning does it have 1 chance to proc per cast, or per enemy hit?
---
I love how salty and butt hurt people got over this  post.
---
gr8 instance and i enjoyed it on my last playthrough as horde but... i'm rolling alliance in classic and i cant wait to do DM again.  the whole defias story is awesome and DM is a really fun dungeon.  Plus its a bit less aids to run through than WC haha
---
loot isnt quite as awesome tho
---
You probably got one of the streamer invites by accident. Those get special treatment.
---
I didn't question how it used to work. I never played hunter, only priest (and druid to lvl 30 ish).
---
I guess maybe it depends of your spec but if I wear a hunter I would like my range weapon to be hit the closest.
---
If the launch goes well it stands a good chance at getting a lot of modern graphic updates. Plus they are charging for it. You can't play classic unless you subscribe. 
---
They already have a separate team dedicated to classic wow as well. Plus most of the updated models and assets are already there. They just need to port them from modern.
---
&gt;I know we all agree to no balancing changes in classic, but if we want a true blizzlike experience we should have blue posts every week detailing how shamans have been nerfed again
---
That's the spirit!
---
Could of launched it it in the morning US time, that way US and EU both win
---
Dumb answer
---
I remember tanking Verdan on my Druid in Vanilla. It wasn‚Äôt all that difficult. Granted, it depends on your level and how slow you take things. Im sure anybody from retail would have strung me up for taking pulls so slow and insisting on CC for every pull when it could work.
---
This actually isn‚Äôt true. 3/3 is superior and way more efficient, just time your cone of cold properly
---
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt do too bad‚Äù they had 0 deaths, they couldn‚Äôt do much better aside from speedrunning.

Imagine thinking getting paid 1k per month on a 1000 view stream, less than 50k subs is worth being jelous over

Hi, /u/Dangirl13
---
True but that would put it at Asia‚Äôs midnight - nobody wins however much you shift the goal posts on this one I think

Nope, couldn't give two shits about beta. I'll barely have enough time for release in August, let alone this neckbeard fiesta.
---
now how about our boy madseason
---
Did you really just post the link and time and then post a fake quote he didn‚Äôt say? Lmfao.
---
He said there‚Äôs very few warriors that can probably duel on his level. That doesn‚Äôt imply he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs the best at all lol
---
This is fun to watch and should be encouraged. You are in a PvP server for a reason. If you complain about this then go play PVE lol.
---
Orc or Troll shaman? Help me decide for my Classic WoW main.
---
Frost has 39k subs, thats not exactly a minor youtuber.
---
For just above a minimum wage salary of course (hey, it says entry position, you have to climb the ladder my friend!)
---
29, married, job, and a newborn, currently playing 5 hours a week / when I get time / when I feel like it on another server just to see how I go. Expect this will continue into Classic when launched. Keen to meet like-minded people :)

Hi, /u/ausgeo123
---
Awesome, it's nice see true advocates for Classic! Tired of watching top streamers in it for popularity/money.
---
I hope EU players wont have to put up with that. But I cant think of any popular streamer from the EU right now except maybe Forsen and I dont know if he will play or stream it anyway.
---
what ranks of chain heal do i use?
---
also does anyone know how many shaman class books there are? i want to compile a list but im having troubling finding them online.
---
&gt; Written Interactions weren‚Äôt exclusively necessary and more ‚Äútime consuming‚Äù. 
---
Again, goes for LFD too. 
---
It anyway was only about spamming lgf chat with "LFG DM" over and over again. It wasn't "necessary" and it was needlessly "time consuming", so they introduced a GUI option that does only that - letting others know you're in fact looking for this group. It's one of the examples they mentioned in the infamous "you think you do, but you don't" panel answer.
---
But we know what we want. And we do. We want Classic how Vanilla was. Don't try to "make it easier" or "more convenient" for us, especially when it means taking away, albeit small, necessary necessary community interaction.
---
orc for pvp, troll for pve
---
I didn't play vanilla wow. I started with Nostalrius. No nostalgia here.
---
!RemindMe 1 day
---
orc for PVP troll for PVE and orc for looks obviously
---
What spec do you prefer? Orc is more enhancement oriented and troll caster imo.
---
so orc wins
---
and noone really gives a shit about them anymore. we aren't forced onto them. we want a polished product which is what blizz is going to give us and what this beta is for
---
Hi, /u/larde20

I agree with that, but currently, in the Beta it won't give you the proc if Corruption (for example) gets the killing blow while you are draining
---
RemindMe!
---
On top of that, thousands of people are watching the streamers and see bugs and comment about it. A blizzard tester only has to read all the comments (as painful as it is)  to find bugs ;-)
---
id say somewhat. Once osrs got the GE, and unique content, it became way more popular. rs3 still has a small player base but its way less than what osrs is averaging now

Hi, /u/Kreature

---
what on earth...
---
the boss did too much dmg tho. like legit, ok i get it vanilla was hard but and yes they were not playing really good but there were no bosses below 30 just one shotting warriors with a physical attack. that wasnt a thing in classic and i guarantee 100% this wasnt and wont be in classic like that
---
How is the meta on private servers according to 2-hand enhancement? Is it just a meme or is it viable in PvP?
---
Amazing to me that people are going into classic thinking that any other Druid spec but resto was viable.
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
"Mr. UPS man."
---
To be honest once you reach level 60 and get prebis you wont really need to log in that much apart from raid days and maybe 5 hours in the week to farm gold for consumes the rest of the time you can just do fun stuff or not log in at all thats what i love about vanilla theres no dailies you log on because you love playing not because you feel like youll be behind if you miss a day
---
I'm very certain profile pictures are the same everywhere while you can change your nickname on specific servers.
---
Hey Brewer, it's Thordawg. Small world! We played competitive overwatch together with Jay and Nojay and his girl and shit, and a bit of WoW.
---
No. Devs already stated that there will be no phasing nor any cross realm stuff.
---
We'll have layering, that's a sort of wider and much more consistent form of sharding, but it will be limited in time.
---
As for servers, they said we'll have PvP, PvE and RP, no idea how many yet, no RP-PvP at launch but they're open to it if there's demand.
---

---
Umm you should have the bug report thread sticked too guys..

And thats why people who cry for beta invites shouldnt get them... because they aint gonna test anything and treat it like early access "I just wanna play tha game y know?"

2 months beta btw so let the man have something fun for 29 hours
---
Navak just got 30. dunno his playtime though
---
M8. This is basic gameplay shit, not remembering a boss fight. You don't rush into a boss without full health or making sure your healer has full mana. That's WoW 101.
---
Class balance is a tricky thing it is almost impossible to chang balance without changing itemisaton and/or breaking healers in pvp. Honestly  if it is class balance we want i believe the best thing we can hope for is TBC. As a side note I wish ppl would stop using hybrid tax for wow and use the correct term healer tax. Sins it does not apply to warriors
---
I'm not sure why you have such a hard time grasping the concept that being unable to move without it being a damage loss is not the same as being free to move constantly without it being a damage loss.
---
Seconded
---
this would be so awesome
---
True, but Pservers try to replicate the abilities with weird scripting, like how in DM the goblins in the foundry summon the bots right away, where in Asmons stream yesterday, the goblins only summoned 2 bots through the whole foundry and they did it randomly.
---
Back when nost got the C&amp;D letter and the outcry started, I was one of the guys downplaying the interest massively. That mainly stems from my experience on private servers, where, back in 2015/2016 and even before that, there was a ridiculous animosity against the retail WoW version and players who expressed they liked expansion X. Having played on every version of WoW by now (Vanilla and TBC on private servers only), I can honsestly say they all have their pros and cons. Except for WoD, where the only redeeming facts are the music and the raids, I like every version of the game overall.
---
THe thing currently is, that the Beta has huge marketing power. People got hyped up about Classic, so no wonder the bigger streamers will get bigger audiences plus those that are curious. The bigger variety streamers (soda for example) will stop playing the game on stream as soon as their twitch subs start to dwindle and the hype dies down and the actual viewership will even out. Remember, that WoW itself, no matter the version, is not exactly exciting to watch. 
---
Asmongold, Josh and back during Legion, Quinn, are and were entertaining to watch. All the other retail streamers usually have their dedicated viewership.
---
Retail also has the benefit that the raids are still top notch and even though M+ is arguably worse than it was in Legion, it is still enjoyable content. Those two alone will always keep players in the game. The raids are also mechanically way more difficult, so people who play the game for that would get bored with Classic raids. Meanwhile, you got others who like the logistical aspect, bigger raids and the (class) clique formations in guilds more, which basically only happens in Classic.
---
I just hope that the toxic part, that mainly comes from the private server community, won't pollute the game.
---
they will hate you for such posts

haha, the shady car dealer sounds about right.
---
this guy is clearly only in it for the vanilla popularity contest and/or twitch bux with the way he tries to set up "epic gamer moments" for clips and what not
---
The bigger the streamer the more useless they are for testing. Most of them have no experience playing vanilla wow. They are just here to flex their e-peen and marketing purpose.
---
Pick a class you'll enjoy. Statistically speaking, your chances of getting Thunderfury are very low. I wouldnt factor that into your decision. Just my 2c.
---
Lol noob
---
The only time I get attacked in wpvp is when i have 20% hp and some rogue stuns me.
---
streamer fanboys are the worst
---
From what others are saying their lowest level is 19?  They were overleveled by vanilla standards for the dungeon.  It was rare for most of the groups I did for DM back in the day to have anyone level 20+.  Usually most groups were 17-19 range where it was appropriately difficult with an occasional level 20 sprinkled in.  If a large part of the group is the same level as the final boss then ... yeah most dungeon runs will not be overly challenging.
---
People played pservers for 10 year. Writing that was a waste of time.
---
I think Soda is just underestimating the game and tries to carry to hard and ultimately falls short on the healing.

He has proven several times that hes a good player and Im sure hell eventually get the hang of it, and IIRC hes played Vanilla many times on private servers and was one of the main forces pushing for original classic WoW. That guy was on the Nostalrius train and classic movement day one and has contributed a lot.  
---
Well, cant speak much for Tips, but I feel like people should cut Soda some slack.
---
If I were to entertain a stream, I would be soooo awful, even if it's a game I play well. Respect to Tipsout for being capable of *some* multitasking :)
---
I've seen/been on multiple sides of the debate, so I can briefly list the pros and cons of each.
---
Classic was super grindy.  Lots of time spent out in the world instead of raid logging.  Inflation was not as rampant due to the lack of dailies.  Reputation factions only gave niche items that most didn't bother with (except for poor ... err... filthy rich enchanters). 
---
Some bosses were hard, but only because the raid-ready concept was still being developed.  You take an average modern raid guild and drop them back to 2004 and they'd be getting world firsts left and right.
---
The worst part of Classic is a loud minority of the fanbase.  Toxic tryhards abound in the private server blizzlike community, and they're clamouring the loudest for Classic's return.  People who min-max their gear and spell rotations to mathematical perfection and then demand other players to build their strategies around them are the most infuriating specimens among wow players I've met, and Classic seems to their clarion call.
---
The biggest difference you'll find going from MoP to classic is the loot quality and availability.  You'll celebrate your first blue, you'll struggle for weeks for your first purple, you'll go bankrupt for your first endgame enchant (+3 beastmaster!).  You might not be able to afford your first mount until 47 (53 on my first character).
---
Also, you might not be able to find Mankrik's wife.  But you will learn all the ancient legends of Chuck Norris, and will be puzzled as to why so many people mention Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.
---
There‚Äôs a bias for accounts from Vanilla
---
My question is, have any NON subbed players been invited?
---
Agreed. And I also don't care if that bug might've been in Vanilla. I'd rather it be fixed for Classic release.
---
Open Beta is definitely a form of early access, but if you're playing Closed Beta and neglecting bugs, you don't deserve to be there 
---
Then again streamers like Asmon and Soda are solely for PR so even Blizzard doesn't care at that point.
---
Literally anything goes imho. If you're up against someone 5 levels higher than you, stalk him until he's engaging 2 mobs at 50% hp and kill him then. 
---
I am against corpsecamping or killing someone a ton, but every Alliance I meet, no matter the level, I want to kill at least once, even if costs me my cooldowns, a healh pot and a swiftness pot to do it.
---
I'm not sure why you keep bringing up the word "constantly" as if there is some merit to it.
---
You keep posing scenarios like why not just use EF if you need to move. That implies an absence of all other scenarios where you cant use EF frivolously.
---
On top of that, I also explain so many time now how even if you were free to us it, it would almost certainly NOT be an efficient use anyway.
---
And yet, somehow, you STILL think that "literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving."
---

Cancelled sub, active gametime.
---
Just need [Questie](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev) to work next.
---
I‚Äôm sure he can, it‚Äôs just that I got the impression that he felt that anything over 1 day played to 30 was ‚Äúslow‚Äù.  Clearly the current world record is over 1 day so hardly slow.
---
Brian Kopp's guide also did that. Darkshore is extremely fast if you know what you're doing, and has enough quests that you can practically go straight from 10-20 there, though going into EK for a level or two would likely be more optimal depending on what quest chains you can throw into the mix and what less worthwhile darkshore quests you skip as a tradeoff.
---
Yeah... I know getting thunderfury is like not gonna happen probably. But despite that? I‚Äôm not even sure what‚Äôs more enjoyable to play. I only seen classic videos, and played sooo little back then, I was literally a kid, so I couldn‚Äôt reeally tell.
---
Maybe someone report it anyway? You've got video evidence right here.
---
I started college in 2001 and finished in 2018.  There was some stuff in between but I‚Äôm comfortable enough with my scholastic successes to imply it took 17 years of study to complete my degree.
---
...how?
---
thomas miller strutting around town with his big baguette
---
Ironically more people ends up getting in who doesn't care about bug reporting than people who would hunt bugs but they didn't get in..
---
If you are looking for what can use legendaries, you answered your own question. In terms of what can be fun, literally any class can qualify. You have two opposing belief systems, there, unless rogue or warrior (namely, a tank) fit your desires. Also note that raiding in classic, especially getting those legendaries, wasn't simply an effort of time or dedication but generally required an entire guild (or two) at least a good few weeks of dedicated efforts and a lot of luck to furnish one of those bad boys up. And raids weren't the short 2-5 hour ordeal they are now. I remember my quickest Molten Core run lasting about 6 hours, most lasted closer to 10.
---
I played during classic retail and will be reliving my glory days with my buddy, so we will likely do a warrior tank/priest healer combo, dual-hunter combo, and I'll squeak in a solo mage somewhere along the way. Those were the classes I personally enjoyed the most - I recall a friend having exquisite success as a retribution paladin, and another as an elemental shaman. If you play a class you enjoy and become good at, most of the time that's enough. Classic is much more about your personal adaptability and how you use your class, I feel, than what retail is like now.
---
I knew Asmongold would be a bitch in regards to classic, fucker said no changes and then bitches about quests not being on map when he had a little issue finding one location.
---
He‚Äôs a bitch, nothing more nothing less.
---
Super smash brothers melee peaked at 66k this month, and that game is 18 years old. There's lots of nostalgia for games from that time, not surprising there's lots of hype.
---
I know I was into vanilla wow then, but I don't think my rose colored glasses are strong enough. It was a pretty poor mmo experience when compared to what we expect today.
---
Mainly meme tbh... It is fun and can be strong but a good geared ele is usually stronger and seen more requently since they can also do good heals.
---
But hey - Play whatever feels right to you :)
---
Well I'm not sure if I should see this as a bug or not. It doesn't affect the gameplay and in my opinion it's the same like getting under SW / Org. If he would've fallen down and died it would be a different story.
---
I didn't see it til TBC. And we made fun of everyone that used it.
---
Warriors with red armor and in battle stance? Sure, why not? At that point he's not a warrior any more, he's a clothie.
---
No where did I say people were noobs in classic but I find it preposterous that you assume people will be the same skill level 15 years after a game has been out! The fundamentals of the game are still the same and definitely most people who played classic have given one of the newer espansions a try. Also games in general have become much harder so the average game skill has gone up. Finally everyone has access to better hardware now so more people are on an even level playing field. The good players of retail now are definitely better than the classic players as they‚Äôve had 15 years of experience. I think you need to come to terms with the fact that you are not as good as you think you are.
---
&gt; I don't think you know how different the architecture is between now and then.
---
I think you misunderstood me. By "small part" I meant that it is small when compared to the entirety of mechanic that are similar already. There's, of course, no doubt that WoW Classic requires a great deal of work to (re)create but it is a lot less work than if they had to create the engine from scratch.
---
Blizzard should revoke beta access for people who don't report bugs. the point of a beta is to bug test, everyone seems to be forgetting that and just treats it as "early access".
---
Well, before playing I had nostalgia for many things and turns out it was pure nostalgia and those things are in fact actually boring. However, there are other things I had no nostalgia for that make the game good in its own right and that's why I kept playing.
---
&gt; You keep posing scenarios like why not just use EF if you need to move. That implies an absence of all other scenarios where you cant use EF frivolously.
---
No, I keep saying if you're using EF, you get to move without it costing you anything
---
&gt; it would almost certainly NOT be an efficient use anyway.
---
So, if you're standing in the wrong position at a time where you would be casting EF... EVEN IF YOU WERE IN THE RIGTH POSITION... you should not use that channel time to move?
---
&gt; It's like you actually have no concept or understanding of what that statement even means. Perhaps that is the issue here.
---
Ironically, it's pretty evident from the scenarios you have to bring up that YOU are the one who has no idea what it means.
---
Glad you enjoyed BGs throughout Vanilla. I definitely agree it‚Äôs nice to have BGs pop up when you need them. Who wants to wait? It just feels to me like the are sacrificing the community of BGs for convenience.
---
Have 2 months gametime worth of gold, so just did that.

The engine may be the Legion engine, but the textures and models are all 1.12 Classic.
---
Is it safe to say that Tips might be the worst player to ever touch this game? (Skill/time played ratio)
---
I'm offended that you said that
---
It's hard to imagine someone more useful for bug testing than someone  that records every second of footage and then anyone of 30,000 people watching can instantly upload 15 seconds of footage to demonstrate any bug they can see. This is like absolute gold mine stuff for a dev even if Soda never reports anything.

I get what you mean... i would love to play a shaman, not gonna lie, but all my friend will be on the alliance so... i kind of have to choose something there. Otherwise I would 100% go for shaman.

I gues that I need to try them or smth, in order to decide.

Yeah... you know you're old when you talk to younger games and they've never played Warcraft...

Even the boss was "bugged" because did too much damage.
---
Sure am got in the second day luckily I‚Äôm living in North America right now so the ping is lovely !
---
may 2006.
---
And I just did the math, I payed around 1500‚Ç¨ to play since then. 
---
(I added the game and extensions price)
---
This also happens on the 1.12 client
---
This is bothering me too, I might get game time on my oldest account
---
Maybe I ‚Äòm wrong here. Maybe this is much ado about nothing. We all want the game and BGs to be fun. I hope whatever they do works. I just still have that memory from Vanilla when BGs for me went from enjoyable to not. Just hoping to get a discussion going about how Blizzard is making BG decisions and hopefully shedding light on issues before they launch.
---
1-2 often, rank 3 on shor burst trash fights and alike. Plus healing wave and lesser healing wave.
---
KJ mythic in the Tomb of Sargeras got killed by 892 guilds in the world. With 20 man raids that is ~2200 players at best, if you consider reclears with different people for the better guilds.
---
Even if the game had "only" 1 million subs by the end of 2017, like some people wish, that would still be ~0.02% of the playerbase who managed to kill the final boss of tier 20. Kil'Jaeden mythic is also considered one of the hardest bosses ever created, particularly because the personal responsibility was ridiculously high in that fight. It also wasn't really worth rekilling since the boss didn't drop good enough loot.
---
In naxx the numbers are similar or even lower, but mainly because the time before TBC was relatively short and because people just learned most of the gear they'd get out of it would be worthless when TBC launches. While the gear reset every 2 years on the launch of a new expac is now generally accepted, it was different back then. My father was in a MC guild back then and he told me that half the guild never bought TBC  or just quit the game in early 2007 because of the gear reset.
---
A lot of people may not like the multiple difficulties, but without them there wouldn't be any actual difficult bossfights in modern WoW anymore I reckon. Although I think they should remove normal as a difficulty. Keep LFR for the mentally challenged, heroic as the actual beginner difficulty and mythic for the people with balls.
---
Pretty much... these days open betas don't happen before devs feel the game is ready for release anyway, because as soon as they open the gates the amount of complaints about the tiniest of bugs are absolutely insane.
---
I hear u bro
---
It's also 14 years too late :)
---
recount...
---
This is everything I ever wanted.
---
They're the type of dummies that project their biases onto other people. I don't like this thing so neither should anyone else. If they do they are wrong and stupid and i have to tell them reeeeee!
---
&gt; Did you have an active sub when you got it?
---
Yes!!
---
I would reject you if I was the Raidlead of a World top maybe 50 Guild or so. Any normal Guild will be happy to have someone who can actually play their Class regardless of Race
---
Good boy, you do you man!
---
He was full health ?
---
You do you man, don't let people on here tell you how to enjoy the game.
---
Apparently Tipsout is a talker, not a gamer :) He should stick to making youtube videos talking about patches and release dates...
---
My money is on him for first to 60. I know a lot of other runners have set really strong times on private servers, but I don't think the quest experience from later levels was ever truly accurate.
---
Either way it will be a hell of a race.
---
Who cares about real mmo testing, need to pump hype up and play in empty servers.
---
Dude, play what you want to. Don't let other people dictate how you have fun. Nothing wrong with people giving advice, but if they are forcing a play style on you, they are not worth you time.
---
Brewer I'd like to also put my name in for a turn when you're bored, thanks :)
---
Stop watching, its that simple.
---
Yeah. The way they look in modern is just "too animated" like Disney or something. Vanilla had a way more unique style.

I watch him now and then and even if he‚Äòs a weird guy he‚Äòs quite entertaining and that‚Äòs the most important part for me.
---
Sadly i couldn‚Äòt catch that run.
---
Its just that theres soo many pretentious, clickbaity, money hungry streamers. Not enough just ‚Äòchill‚Äô people that aren‚Äôt loud talking egotrippers.
---
&gt;No, I keep saying if you're using EF, you get to move without it costing you anything
---
That in itself isn't inherently useful. And being able to move during one spell on a cooldown is also not inherently useful or going to line up with any time you need to move.
---
Again, how does this relate to
---
Or is your point now, "every class can perform to their maximum while moving if they are already casting X spell which can be cast while moving and they also need to move while casting X spell". Because if so, lol.
---
&gt;Ironically, it's pretty evident from the scenarios you have to bring up that YOU are the one who has no idea what it means.
---
The funny part here being that you clearly don't know what it means for something to be ironic. 
---
Again, it really does seem pretty evident that it is YOU who doesn't have a clue. *shrug*
---
Did u have sub on your oldest account?
---
Not yet I‚Äôve got questions though, if you can multi task. Did you receive an email and had you reactivated your account beforehand?
---
Used to bomb it on my mage back in WotLK - I member. People get so pissy when you AOE all the Auctioneers.
---
Well, of course, anything can happen. I don't see them doing that, however.
---
The most logical and cost effective choice is to bring TBC and Wrath down the line. (Or even more expansions, there are fans for them. ;) I'm pretty sure the Classic team will get to work on that after some time has passed since release.

He's probably sleeping, dealing with real life that got  put off, etc. You guys are brutal :)
---
I'm gonna level prot.
---
...and so what? As has been demonstrated over the last few days, the private servers have been wrong about quite a bit.
---
It‚Äôs actually the same engine
---
Playing against the same people over and over again is actually super fucking boring. I imagine that's what Hell is like.
---
On your oldest account ? I have active sub on the one with BFA but not on my oldest that is from vanilla.
---
&gt;people have the right to spend their money on what they want but also regardless of popularity or how much someone is worth
---
I wasn't questioning their right to do it, I made that clear.
---
&gt; if they are entertaining to you and you enjoy the content what difference does it make?
---
I also made the difference clear lol.
---
The difference ranges from helping a streamer who entertains you eat for the week to helping a streamer who entertains you buy a lamborgini. That difference may not matter to you, which is anyone's right and one I'd fight for. I still think it's ridiculous though.
---
He missed the first wave but he'll still be first to 60 in the beta i'm sure.
---
Well this is just wrong lol
---
It's probably not a bug, I saw this happening in loads of low level dungeons even in wotlk.
---
You only "need one" if you got a lot of warlocks but you actually just want a priest in shadow weaving spec to keep up the useful +shadow dmg debuff in-between heals.
---
I'm English, sarcasm is my first language but not everyone would get the joke without it
---
This is common but there's nothing we can do about it unfortunately. Influencers have too much power. Case in point shroud is a classic example. The guy isn't known for playing WoW, he's a former CS pro and top level PUBG player. 
---
What kind of valuable information are they going to get from him when he's not even streaming the beta? He played the beta for like 2-3 hours on the 15th and then went back to PUBG. Seems like a complete waste.

Blizzard does have an internal server up and running to cross reference with. At least we‚Äôve been told that.
---
I dint want to stop you, I want to kite you around and slowly bring you down ;)
---
"Hey team, what are your opinions on a Vanilla only server?"    
---
"They think they do, but they don't"  
---
"Great, I'll let them know. That's what we pay you for"
---
When he started regularly streaming on twitch he was around 3k viewers on average. Every since the BFA pre-patch his numbers started to increase like crazy.
---
Be more specific. What do you do between t2 &amp; t3 if you don't like PvP?
---
When one of the choices is pay someone very who also entertains you. Yes.
---
I‚Äôve just seen tipsout with ‚Äúworld first sfk‚Äù... the clickbate is awful, it‚Äôs 15 years late and a beta, it‚Äôs pathetic.
---
From hearing him talk about that stuff I would not expect him to make any attempts before live. Now will just be prep time and working on the guides.
---
I wonder if they'll give that buy back feature as they will have less GMs.
---
Yes, I resubbed once the release date was announced but have not subbed since January.
---
Thats right my brother!
---
Just Play what the F**k you want! And if your guild has banned you from discord - roll the other faction and rip them apart with your guild every time they try to raid :P
---
Wow is not all about min-maxing! It is mostly about fun (IMHO) so Play what you like :)
---
I only beat it by using the cannon. Easy to manage mobs when the tank is the only thing they can aggro onto.
---
Nope, you're wrong. People being held accountable is exactly his point.
---
More wrong. 3/3 is better. Time your CoC, two blizzards, CoC back up, Nova in emergencies
---
these streamers get tens of thousands per month everything combined. yes he is a millionaire.
---
Yeah I have. The mainstream guys at least. I'm trying to find a humble one just to check out the game. I haven't touched private servers and I leveled casually throughout vanilla, didn't raid back then. Having the mornings free at home along with the hype that I'm going to play with my friends again is fun so I'm trying to find a streamer that doesn't pat himself on the back about doing Stockades and has to announce it on twitter.
---
Yep, he got chunked
---
Shit like this is why I read comments. Cheers bud.
---
I think it's more they're just being elaborate and over the top deliberately. Asmon used to put stupid shit in his title like "NO DEATHS" - even on Nameless King - and we all know he was bullshitting and joking
---
This is the best time to play it. I‚Äôd suggest booking some time off for August 27th to experience the hype of a launch day
---
Dude no, let‚Äôs go original route. Release kharazhan, emeral dream, mount hyjal etc the way they were meant to be out in vanilla. Going to TBC and wrath will only introduce elements to break the immersion and community.
---
I can try, I have 2 jobs to use holiday for ü§£
---
Indeed, I posted because I believe these three will provide a more objective review and test of things for the Beta than some of the guys and share their results with the community, each in their own way.
---
cata kids know it this way
---
Was the active sub on your oldest account? I have 1 account from vanilla and 1 with BFA. Active sub is on the BFA account.
---
I would argue that the resources spent on retail have largely been wasted.
---
female if you're middle aged woman
---
If I can I will!
---
More like Patchwerk. He got 2 shot hahaha
---
Literally this, I quit retail during TBC found my first private vanilla realm within 2 years and have been playing them ever since
---
Asmon could stream RL stuff and still get 60k+ because that's how much of an "influence" he has. When you bring classic wow into the picture it's really not that hard to fathom (this is what he's known for).
---
CC?  What's that?
---
With broken armor the physical damage reduction was at 25% at best, that makes the boss still hit with over 200 per hit, not counting crits.

The best part of the game is getting lost and learning. Don't rush things, just play and find out.
---
It still is, but people don't remember anymore that minimaps, rested XP, instanced raids/dungeons, dungeon meeting stones and about a million other QoL features are all giveaways to casual players
---
I think he said he saves over half of it all.
---
Can we agree that if they do, and it‚Äôs entirely possible they will, we need to shitstorm on it. Don‚Äôt matter what they call it or trick they play either. We need to be vigilant
---
WeakAuras is a great addon so im glad.
---
That second paragraph is just wrong. People in my semi-hc guild are actually laughing at the amount of support for these specs on this subreddit. I'd say the amount of support for thsee specs on here is more related to a split between hardcore players on one side and more casual players allied with wishful people aiming to play those specs. Not between pserver/retail players.
---
&gt; And being able to move during one spell on a cooldown is also not inherently useful
---
Okay, I'm fucking done, no one in the right mind would legitimately believe this go watch any good player actually play the game and you'll see they utilize this every single pull.
---
&gt; Again, how does this relate to
---
&gt; "literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving."
---
You mean how does the fact that every class being able to move with performing to their maximum related to the fact that literally every class can move while performing to their maximum?
---
&gt; Or is your point now, "every class can perform to their maximum while moving if they are already casting X spell which can be cast while moving and they also need to move while casting X spell". Because if so, lol.
---
That has been my point all along, but you (either by malice or stupidity) have been interpreting my statement to the most extreme of interpretations in order to try to discredit it.
---
&gt; The funny part here being that you clearly don't know what it means for something to be ironic.
---
"happening in a way contrary to what is expected, and typically causing wry amusement because of this."
---
Now this is quality content
---
This 100% is what I remember it was never VC back in the day.
---
Exactly :)
---
Healers are always underplayed and in high demand. Warlocks were considered to be bottom feeders until DrakeDog.
---
I think you would see the new models on your own screen but everyone else would see whatever their own settings were?
---
I bet Asmon would prefer the axe :D
---
Good thing you can make excuses for him. Let‚Äôs make him the next kardashian!
---
While I cant speak for the other streamers, Sodapoppin has said, multiple times, that all he's ever wanted to stream was classic wow. He doesn't care about his viewer count at this point (he gets 10s of thousands of viewers no matter what game he plays) and said the only reason he would stop streaming classic is if the griefing from the stream snipers is too much since he's gonna be on a pvp server
---
Regarding your other point, have you not noticed how terribly low viewer count numbers are (historically speaking) when the top streamers are raiding or doing M+? Asmongold gets more viewers at this point playing other games, and lets be honest, he's not a variety streamer in the slightest. BFA is not enjoyable to watch anymore outside of the first 2 weeks of new content.
---
This is blizzlike behaviour, not a bug
---
Ok, thank you for answering :)
---
Being this salty I suggest you write another essay about Blizzard and your PTO. PJSalt
---
They are friends irl. They also keep telling me on how it's hard for a new player to play warrior and how I am going to fail at it. So I am kinda scared rolling one
---
Yeah I must admit, this surprised me
---
The most popular WoW streamer
---
Are you a veteran or a new player like me?
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Defias looters and defias pillagers both were in Blizzards top 20 most dangerous NPCs list.
---

Such a zoomer thing to say

It was called VC before Dire Maul ever came out.  Check out the first comment here, posted Feb 2 2005, https://web.archive.org/web/20050518092536/http://www.thottbot.com:80/?i=5664

---
Please do stay true to that conviction. This world has got to stop giving stupid people passes and making them famous. Bad play is one thing, the bug report is idiotic, and the outright lying he‚Äôs done is disgusting.

Nice
---
Absolutely. I've been coordinating three guilds in BFA to all join into a single server at launch for this exact purpose.
---
Tbh there are probably Blizzard employees watching soda play the beta since he is one of the top 2 wow streamers and if that‚Äôs true than he knows, so it would be a waste of time to report anything.
---
He is to stupid to be famous, and rampant fanboi stupidity will make him so regardless. I wonder if anyone ever predicted irl apocalypse would be due to mass wilful ignorance, because I‚Äôm starting to suspect something.
---
Does any1 really remember the out of combat reg for each specific level?
---
So wierd that people would assume blizzard is wrong because they experiecend it differently on a privat server.
---
Early on there were a bunch of issues with the servers staying up. I started in December and have all the same credits.
---
Just play who you want mate, I'm thinking of rolling pal or rogue not because of damage or healing but because I want to :) while my friend is rolling druid
---
Oh, the triple pulls. Easily avoided
---
How much can you change something before it's no longer the same?
---
I really don't understand why everyone on this sub has a hard on for this guy. His streams are a bit cringy yeah, but his youtube videos are entertaining. Maybe not the best researched and you can and should call him out on that but....That kinda retardeness displayed on the video is beyond comprehensible.
---
When people "hate someones guts" for making videos about an old video-game....Why? What are you doing with your life? Rethink your priorities. Sometimes I think Asmongold is right in saying that the worst part of classic is the community, albeit it's also the best part of classic.
---
Death threats are not "fun". Especially for content creators that put themselves out there. Doxxing and Swatting is a big issue, that has happened multiple times and it's really fucking dangerous. This type of shit is why some content creators don't even like showing their face.
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
I'll bring lunch!
---
Play what you like. It's a game, goal is to have fun.
---
I've been around around wow long enough to know when athene is around. "For them kids..." Like the charity you supported. Don't you have a cult to run and people to scam?
---
Pre nerf is before 1.9. Only thing that pets didn‚Äôt have nerfed in 1.12 is attack speed.
---
Yeah, it's just that not being accepted by groups would have been even less fun than playing a dwarf!
---
The same was said about WildStar. Turns out players today want to play content themselves, not only read about it.
---
Crendor is your guy
---
I‚Äôd rather friends and guild members be on classic where I can shoot them a message than playing FF where I can‚Äôt. Honestly I‚Äôm going to play classic in the boring stretches of retail.
---
By vets they mean people that played on private servers exclusively. That means the information they've got is wrong in most cases.
---
The average age of a Vanilla player was in their early mid 20's to early 30's. I've seen way too many posts of people claiming they were &lt; 10 when they "raided in classic". It's really quite amusing.
---
Oh. I don't like his face.
---
Oh boy I‚Äôm not looking forward to buying ore then running all the way the fuck to dwarven district to smelt or craft some shit lol
---
pvp gets unflagged when crossing zones e.g from elwynn to westfall (even during combat). Obviously only for alliance when in ally zones and vice versa.

people used to say something like "LFM VC" because they were looking to run the dungeon and clear van cleef
---
kinda weird way to say it since u always aimed to finished DM for the loot but yeah
---
&gt;Also games in general have become much harder so the average game skill has gone up.
---
*Citation needed*
---
Games have become harder? Like, all games?
---
Some, like Dark Souls are hard. Gamers come in all shapes and sizes. Some play the hard games, some don't. 
---
&gt;The good players of retail now are definitely better than the classic players as they‚Äôve had 15 years of experience.
---
Jesus fucking CHRIST they haven't been playing for 15 years! Hardly any current retail players have played more than a few years. They mostly won't be playing classic either.
---
You come with all these wild assertions about what's true and not and it's clear you haven't actually given it a moment's thought. You're just expressing your feelings.   
---
This is ridiculous.

There are good and there are bad games today, just add back then.   
---
When we started WoW back then we'd all been playing games (HARD GAMES) for *years*. Extremely competitive games like CS and UT, complex strategy games, etc. 
---
This is so silly.
---
For us if is pretty standard to coordinate specs. E.g a certain priest might be told to come as shadow weaving spec with the default being power infusion spec. Or one mage might be told to spec winter''s chill with the default being a frost-arcane spec. Some specs have a slight room for variance of course. We tanks also coordinate, currently we're 3 fury-prot tanks but we have slight variations based on the player's preferences. 
---
We're not bringing any offspec/hybrid specs usually.
---
Kudos to him but let‚Äôs also remember all those smaller streamers playing classic. Don‚Äôt forget to support them! (No I‚Äôm not one of them)
---
IIRC the difficulty reduction factor was added in 2.3, lowering the XP requirement for next level. Outland mobs reward more XP, but the 1-58 journey wasn't easier until that. 
---
Since they see player flying as a mistake, some changes must be made to TBC content but I doubt it's anything too big.
---
big dick
---
yes...
---
Do you mean their RoF? 
---
That‚Äôs dependent on the weapon speed of the gun, if I‚Äôm correct.
---
Haha oh dude, you think you got a W?   
---
He posts pics and video - but nope, it's just not possible kiddo! 
---
Bruh before long you'll be demanding you won't believe him until he lets you sit on his lap while you play his Classic  üòÇ
---
Not sure how that's entitled in any way but if you've been on the internet in any capacity in 14 years you've probably heard of Warcraft at some point. Whether you decided to look into it or not is up to you.
---
surprised paladin is last...
---
Imo the most important thing is playing the class you WANT, regardless of balance. If you enjoy the rogue playstyle, go rogue
---
Bug report: this is too hard plz nerd I‚Äôm e famous ok bye - not okey m8. Regardless of any fanboi excuse.
---
If they would be real friends they would help you if you get stuck with your warrior. 
---
No worries, back in 2004 no one knew about how good / bad classes were, they just rolled what they liked most. If you like warrior, just roll one.
---
I feel ganking somebody would increase the chance of them calling their guildies on you.
---
Well if I play an ice mage, then yes I can totally stop you from playing!
---
Separate client.
---
I leveled a hunter on live for heritage with heirlooms and an hour a level was my best. No heirlooms and in classic an hour a level is fast. Really fast. There have been really a lot of XP reduction for early levels over the years.
---
Eh, Kargoz is super annoying
---
Weapons back then had vastly different attack speeds. I have no clue what's the speed of the troll starting bow, but I assume it's kinda fast.
---
It's weather it's meant to give the feeling you're in a living breathing world the fact you find it annoying is inconsequential.
---
Weekly ret moans for buffs are already confirmed so this is also possible ;)
---
Except he supposedly has the all important private server lvl 60 experience. If it was just one instance you could be right, but he is consistently wrong. To me it feels like he is far more focused on rushing out content and getting fans than actually providing any meaningful content. That and the lies etc is just not okey.
---
Holy shit I remember this book I used to have this way back in the day. Me and my brother would get all hype looking at bosses we hadn‚Äôt gotten to yet
---
Correct! Tauren druid
---
And I disagree with that. There was a lot of painfully obvious bugs that private server players spotted right away in the Demo, while other people even argued on the forums that werent bugs. Like the 200% spellcrit modifier.
---
Will private server players get it wrong? Yes, ofcourse. But that dont mean they wont provide valuable feedback regardless.
---
That was in classic. You'd make a macro that made your pet stop attacking while casting improve soul shard.
---
Being a streamer is more akin to a commentator rather than a professional player.
---
&gt; This community is so toxic, and the gatekeeping is at 200%
---
Absolutely correct. Why so much gatekeeping? Who the fuck cares if you played back then or not? Is it not enough that you want to experience classic??? Can you not be passionate about something and never had participated in it??
---
Call out inacurate videos or information, that's fine and should be encouraged. Aside from some light hearted pot shots the "hate" should stop there.
---
Keep going dude, create that fake outrage. Make this a huuuuuuuge problem (when it isn't).
---
Makes sense to me. 
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

&gt; he was still a new content creator he lied and said he was a vanilla veteran

I'm a Vanilla Veteran. Started 2 weeks after releases (7 years old, Dad played that got me into it) played all the way through the expansion on my own account. Got level 43 in total on a Warlock. At least I got my mount.

V E T E R A N

He is not perfect but its damn sure that he is really good at streaming and keeping the viewers entertained with all the jokes and insightful comments.

A Paladins only goal in PvP is to take 4 people to kill him...

Is it possible to toggle weather effects in classic? Excuse my ignorance.

What?
---
Theres absolutely no issue with attacking an opposing faction while he's killing a mob. 
---
He sees an enemy. 
---
He needs to kill it to stay safe. 
---
The enemy is busy killing a mob? Perfect.
---
Shit he's almost dying himself. He has a potion! Perfect!
---
If you're crying about another person is playing a game just the way the game is supposed to be played, then you should not play that game. Period.
---
I do believe you are very correct in that, but if this Dude becomes major influencer, such as we are making him and he starts puking out this stuff it can create a conversation where there shouldn‚Äôt be one. At some point it becomes a thing you can‚Äôt control, and do not be naive and think blizzard will stick to some sense of integrity - don‚Äôt ever give a corporation that much credit. It only ends one way of two ways: either we stay vigilant and adamant about what we want, calling out stupidity and liars, or we‚Äôll get a diluted dumbed down game. It‚Äôs not just one bug or guy, it‚Äôs about not letting anything catalyst us into a truly sad situation.
---
Fuck yea I support you!
---
make sure you report this obvious bug
---
Exactly. Bunch of baby's downvoting the truth
---
&gt;Okay, I'm fucking done, no one in the right mind would legitimately believe this go watch any good player actually play the game and you'll see they utilize this every single pull.
---
You're done because you're clearly a moron. You pull that line out of context and obviously it wont make sense.
---
I'm saying it isnt inherently useful. Being able to move IS NOT inherently useful... unless you need to move. 
---
If you ask "any good player"  "is a spell that you can cast while moving better than a spell that you cant move during if you dont need to move?" the answer is that both are the same.
---
&gt;You mean how does the fact that every class being able to move with performing to their maximum related to the fact that literally every class can move while performing to their maximum?
---
What the fuck are you even trying to say here?
---
&gt;That has been my point all along, but you (either by malice or stupidity) have been interpreting my statement to the most extreme of interpretations in order to try to discredit it.
---
So what you are saying is, your original statement was incredibly poorly worded, and clearly worded to try and impart bias against retail based on a completely false statement. OK.
---
&gt;"happening in a way contrary to what is expected, and typically causing wry amusement because of this."
---
Explain what exactly happened here that was contrary to what is expected?
---
"as literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving."
---
You stated this as a fact, in an attempt to pose classic wow as somehow inherently more difficult than retail. 
---
Idk, this is obviously pointless.
---
You're an awful player by objective measures, you speak about content you have never even experienced, and you speak about efficiency and performance when you, objectively, cant even play your own main for shit.
---
On top of that you are so clearly delusional and unwilling to actually consider that your point of view is wrong that this isn't going to go anywhere.
---
Keep believing that "literally every class can perform to their maximum while moving" and that vanilla classic raiding is more difficult than live. 
---
Pure delusion.
---
Huh? What has my PTO to do with this?
---
Imagine getting 500 upvotes for writing VC instead of DM.
---
&gt; His videos would take a shred of info and blow it up into a bunch of nonsense
---
I don't want to hate on him too much but this is a legit criticism. He always blows every little detail out of proportion to try and convince you that Vanilla wow was this one of a kind amazing gem that has never been seen before or since.
---
Sure we are fans of this game and it is amazing, but when he is clearly overstating every little detail in the game, it makes him sound like a cultist tbh.
---
What a fucking clown, vouching for no change and complaining about difficulty the first day because he's as knowledgable as a fucking goldfish. Shame on you Tips.
---
The only two classes i have never played in my wow career are warrior, and mage... two of the most populated classes in classic. This was drastically reducing my desire to finally try them out. Seeing as my old main of warlock also seems to have risen in popularity i might as well just play warrior and try my hand at tanking (at 60).
---
U can go for a budget gaming laptop with a gtx 1050 and you'll be good as gold
---
Because streamers are in the beta and they are not i guess.
---
First few months, you don't want to miss. As a metric, consider that pretty much every major streamer is going to be playing when it launches. The hype for the game is going to be even more than it is now. It's likely going to be even larger and crazier than the original Vanilla launch.
---
Lmao this post is wrong on so many levels.
---
Dude being internet famous is not some privilege that comes with entitlements. They do work, they should get paid. That‚Äôs the end of it, it goes no further.
---
Its cool man. I'll just put down windfury totem and you spam hamstring k?
---
I've leveled deep prot in 2005 and know how the pain feels like.
---
Tbh, will never do it again. I think I'll roll fury and respecc somewhere between 50 and 58 to prot.

Literally says he will respond when he wakes up. Presumably after being awake for a long ass time.

Starshards has one of the highest damage per mana ratios, will definitely help with leveling at least

---
Need to be lvl 35 to level beyond 225
---
Hardcore gatekeeping pretty much. only "true vanilla gamers" that started in vanilla beta and have been playing vanilla for the past 10 years should be playing beta according to most here.
---
But anybody can get into the beta even if they started in BFA and that's a good thing.
---
Mouseover blind macro won‚Äôt lose combo points on current target. Rogues op.
---
If you have enough armor and it isn't broken it won't do as much damage. Their only healer is a druid, I have nothing against them but one of them usually isn't enough to heal properly a five man.
---
The common denominator is your false feeling of self-entitlement.
---
His is the channel I keep sending my old friends to to hype them for classic! It‚Äôs working.
---
He‚Äôs the only dude with access to all these talents that need testing. And different gear, and spells, and spell ranks, and scaling, and quests. You can‚Äôt say he provides little to no data. By just existing and playing the game normally he provides a huge amount of data
---
Nobody should be shit on for this. Neither is wrong. If you‚Äôre server called it VC, cool. If they called it DM, cool.
---
That must be a Canadian server.
---
I ment that I prefer faster shooting and shorter downtime like in 3.3.5. Just a personal preference. Not that it would be good for Classic but I would definitly roll a Hunter if the auto shot speed is faster.
---
Butbutbutt he is my favourite favourite YouTuber so free pass him, mmkai
---
Regrowth was an OH SHIT spell for me. I (well my roommates Druid) had a few points into it at 60 so it had like a 45~ish% chance to crit (May have been higher)
---
But yeah I cycled through rejuv, and like max rank HT and like 3 ranks down HT. Splash dmg got a rejuv, tanks got my lower ranked HT pretty much spammed. NS + Big HT, tranquility, and regrowth were all my emergency buttons. 
---
I also had a TON of spirit gear and two mindtap talismans (before getting a blue dragon card from the fair) so mana usually wasn‚Äôt a problem. 
---
But I healed on his Druid much like I healed on my shaman. But the shaman had no HOTs so it was Max rank HW and LHW plus a few ranks down of each, plus Chain heal and a baby chain heal. And all the MP5 gear I could get on my shaman. (And mana totems on every fight)
---
Seperate client it's going to be about  7GB iirc.
---
Wanting a better launch for all parties (Blizz and the community) = self-entitlement
---
K then.
---
I did, and it was totally worth it.  15 bucks is a drop in the bucket.
---
Also in a 14 year old game.
---
Gotta move the goalposts somehow!
---
&gt; I'm saying it isnt inherently useful. Being able to move IS NOT inherently useful... unless you need to move.
---
And if you position yourself wrong, you DO need to move, I'm not sure how that concept escapes you.
---
&gt; So what you are saying is, your original statement was incredibly poorly worded, and clearly worded to try and impart bias against retail based on a completely false statement. OK.
---
Nope, what I'm saying is factually correct and despite my numerous attempts, you've been unable to grasp the difference between what I said and what you think I said.
---
&gt; You stated this as a fact, in an attempt to pose classic wow as somehow inherently more difficult than retail.
---
and being able to correct your position is wrong in a situation where your position is wrong at no cost vs not being able to do so does not make it more punishing to position yourself wrong in the latter situation compared to the former?
---
&gt; On top of that you are so clearly delusional and unwilling to actually consider that your point of view is wrong that this isn't going to go anywhere.
---
The reason it's not going anywhere is because all you've done for the past 24 hours is call me bad and lie.
---
Sheep love to follow that¬¥s why. When you just read twitch chats for 1minute u can hear your braincells commit suicide.
---
Blizz/Acti upon seeing the twitch numbers:
---
google:  "where to buy cheap servers in bulk"
---
The only thing you realistically would hear from behind the "Retail leveling" door is snoring.
---
Good one:)
---
I relate dude. Any streamer who accepts and even flaunts donations like that is just not enjoyable to watch. I miss totalbiscuit.
---
Before you book any time off, maybe try a private server for a few levels just to see if you like the fundamentals of playing the game. But of course, don't play too much if you do enjoy it...
---
That was the "Ah-ha!" moment for me, as well. I don't watch his stream, just some of his YouTube stuff.
---
&gt; have you not noticed how terribly low viewer count numbers are (historically speaking) 
---
Yup. Outside of the heavily entertaining streamers like the ones I mentioned above the numbers are very low. Of course, a huge part of the reason is that BFA in general... is not the best, to put it nicely. That's why I mentioned this:
---
&gt; All the other retail streamers usually have their dedicated viewership.
---
Sloot, Naguura, the team method streamers, Preach on drama fridays and occasionally when he streams WoW and som emore all kept their viewership relatively the same. On peak hours (~9 pm CEST - 2 am CEST) most of the regular WoW streamers are at around 500-2k at best, per streamer. Then it usually drops off down to sub 100 viewers per streamer.
---
Asmongold is a special case, since he actively involves his viewers even outside of viewer raids. And that's even been like this since before he started reacting to dozens of videos per stream. He makes the game more entertaining.
---
Similar to Sharding but instead of by Battlegroup it is by server. 
---
Also it apparently only assigns you a layer as you login. Rather than as you run around in retail.
---
Sheep following a streamer or sheep hating a streamer. Everyone still a sheep so
---
It was very well executed tho
---
That might be a good idea actually

pog is short for 'pogchamp' which is an emote of a guy with a sort of "woooaah!" face as if you just threw a basketball the length of the court and hit nothing but net
---
the thing i find fascinating is that twitch chat in busy streams is more of a 'vibe' than a conversation.  you can watch the wave of human reactions as a sort of average - if something happens then a majority of messages start to be the same or similar, and just by watching the chat flying past you get a gist of what the crowd is thinking.  sort of like the matrix

Chain heal OP. Wearing cloth gear because it had more spirit.

You gotta pre cast heals, also he was at 60% for like 10 seconds.

Bro I get lost in WC all the time

Good for you, play what you find cool üòé
---
Hi, /u/batmankw
---
Actually, this sort of this would be a client bug, so whether it's 2006 retail or private server, it wouldn't make a difference. But I do get where you're coming from, I've seen people complaining about regen rates or mob damage, without doing their due diligence in terms of researching how these things worked during Vanilla, it took me like 5 minutes to debunk people complaining about low damage, and I know for a fact regen rates are wrong on all/most Private servers.
---
You dont get HKs for kills even though there is an honor tab, so not all phases are open. Its just phase 1
---
Healers in general is one of the most saught after roles in Vanilla regardless of class and race. Arguably the only thing more in demand than a healing priest would be a dwarf healing priest. So you are fine GL.
---
Alot of shamans that play elemental in pvp. It has high potential burst damage and can be very rewarding if played correctly. Consumables/engineering goes a long way. here is a video from a guy I know from private servers: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaarwi51NRQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaarwi51NRQ)  
---
Personally I found 2h windfury very unsatisfying because of its inconsistency. But it can be hilarious.  
---
If you are playing random BGs resto has probably the biggest impact on your win rate.
---
Mad season is just above 200k, one of the larger classic YouTubers
---
The fucks a tier three sub? There‚Äôs tiers to it? How does that work? Sounds vile if I‚Äôm honest m8.
---
&gt;I literally laughed my dick off 
---
RIP in piece to your dick bro
---
Where are all those retail players saying this shit? Seriously, you guys  must be searching for those few comments just to get yourself triggered lmao.
---
I suspect anyone who has admitted to playing on pservers probably will not get an invite. Unless anyone can confirm that any existing beta players have.
---
I'm not sure who got baited here, but just a heads up: it was you.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who worries about these two exact things.
---
Poison/enchant proc hand visual is so important to me
---
That was Vanilla, this is Classic.
---
Shame.
---
He does not have many videos, but the content he has is the best.
---
There‚Äôs a theorycrafting discord that‚Äôs run by Taladril (of classicwow.live). If nobody links it by 5:30 EST, illget you the link when I get home.
---
Hard facts. 
---
The fact remains, Joana of all people were shunned from an invite. It really speaks volumes about blizzard's priorities. This is obviously more about exposure and hype instead of testing things properly.
---
I would suspect that they are worried that their opinions will have an adverse effect to the game. 
---
Those who have not played vanilla really don't know how to judge it. For example, the second to last boss in WC (tree guy). In vanilla he was a monster and mostly skipped until higher level and more gear. 
---
But, those in beta right now are saying it is over tuned. Complaints like this may make Blizzard to reduce the difficulty of certain things in Classic. This a total departure of what the classic community , who have been wanting classic servers for nearly a decade, want. And Streamers that have a large audience will get more attention.
---
That‚Äôs fine. Did the stream have a nice ding sound, your name pop up and a personal thanks tho? That part is less fine if so. It‚Äôs such blatant and vile manipulation.
---
The water hitting the ground looks off. I remember it splashing up more which gave it a more immersive feel that the storm was intense.
---
is this supposed to be news?
---
Tips, Staysafe, Kargoz, Defcamp...pretty much all the streamers have played pservers and are actively comparing some of the meta in beta with pserver experiences
---
The CEO of blizzard, (Same guy that said ‚Äúyou think you do but you don‚Äôt‚Äù) said that depending on the success of classic, they are open to doing TBC and Wrath servers down the line as well, so there‚Äôs that.
---
well yeah, but you don't think classic streamers will have those kind of numbers? Monkeynews has been streaming private servers for a while now and he averages 800ish viewers. When you consider he doesn't stream often nor is it "blizzard approved" that's rather impressive.
---
Yes, he gets a lot of views generally. However, he said that this was his highest view count ever. It‚Äôs interesting that a stream of classic wow beta manages to surpass his top view count of all time in the first 2 days after its release
---
So, It‚Äôs quite impressive and this massive viewer count is clearly not just due to him being popular and indicates a genuine interest in the game. Or maybe people just like to see Van Cleef die :-)
---
I bought it on my account and my brothers account after that because thats the one we shared and it was created in 2008. eating pasta for a few days i guess, hope i get in :\
---
Yeah he made some sort of bet with his viewers when they started the run. Something along the line sof "if we dont wipe once you guys have to sub"
---
 [https://strawpoll.com/a66car1k](https://strawpoll.com/a66car1k)
---
I mean... 
---
For five mans Feral was alright as tank and DPS, and raids would typically have a feral druid. 3% crit to four people is 12% damage (plus crit bonuses) you can be behind them in the meters without being a wasted spot.
---
Will be fixed? Is it unintentional?
---
Using basic tanking skills is min maxing? lol
---
&gt;My guild has banned me from their discord server because they don't need more warriors
---
Cool guild.
---
pallys and damage LOL
---
if you wanna heal but also do damage go shammy
---
I did the same thing so when I hit the barrens I can see the Chuck Norris jokes clearly
---
No changes.
---
Considering that mouseover macros were not a thing in actual vanilla or any of the pserver iterations (as far as I know): it's news, yes.
---
This is awesome!! Great job!
---
Great content creators let's hope they will get in.
---
This guy said it all. I'm all up for #NoChanges either, weather it's colorblind mode or anything of the kind, that's just my philosophy, vanilla is supposed to be the way it is, vanilla, weather there are some things that I like, or some things that I don't like.  
---
Graphics included.  
---
And to the people that say's that graphics do not matter and they're a matter of nostalgia that's a completely made up fact with no source what so ever. A good example for that is that I play AND enjoy countless old school games on GOG &amp; etc.. which I had never played what so ever and I still do appreciate and prefer the polygon/pixel, graphic style to today's realism.
---
I may be mistaken, but I honestly thought you only lost the combo points on the target you have some on if you used a combo point generator on another target. As I said, may be mistaken, played a rogue all of vanilla and bc but it was so long ago. To elaborate, if I had 3 combo points on a target; then swapped to a mob and just auto attacked it while I gained energy back, then switched back to the 3 point mob it would still have it. My memory could be foggy though.
---
In the official wow subreddit and on other forums such as mmo-champion. Lots of salt when classic was announced.
---
That would create an insane artstyle clash.
---
its a meme, go try it on an instant 60 server and enjoy getting kited, it feels so gimped.
---
Do you know coca cola ? Tell me why they spend BILLIONS thats BILLIONS of dollars in advertising even though 99% of the WHOLE population know what coca cola ist.
---
You dont have the slightest idea of how the gaming business/advertising and exposure works. Classic needs exposure ESPECIALLY in the age groups that frequent twitch.
---
Doesn't count it's the beta !
---
I saw deadmines run on the stream, and druids arent suppose to be able to root in the deadmines.
---
That and its only going to last a few weeks.
---
good news, thx!  
---
i like rp-server but without pvp, its worthless
---
Frost, with the option of either aoe or single target. Aoe is obviously faster but leaves you a bit more open in pvp, it is also dependent on having the grinding spots for yourself, and there are fewer of these in classic since many mobs have casted abilities that weren‚Äôt scripted on private servers. 
---
On a side note; I leveled deep fire because I enjoyed the play style, all the specs are comparable, it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll spend days more leveling as any other spec
---
Maybe check out BurkeBlack. I've been watching him for quite some time and well not to say he is bad.... but... well definitly not upper class. BUT... he is absolutley hilarious. Love him. His Star Trek VR or Sea of Thieves Streams are/were absolute gold.
---
Why are you speedrunning a beta instead of checking for bugs?
---
Have you considered that maybe it only looks that way because the streamers are the only ones... streaming?
---
if blizzard and people want the classic experience, then watching streamers is not the correct way to do it. let their streams die so they don‚Äôt have any influence on classic wow in 2019
---
Prety sure he isn't.
---
That is incorrect. It was removed because the cataclysm lightning system wasnt comptible with dynamic weather.
---
It showed my guest pass in early 05 aswell, seems about right
---
&gt; And if you position yourself wrong, you DO need to move, I'm not sure how that concept escapes you.
---
I'm not sure how the concept of you stating things in a vacuum and ignoring everything else eludes you. 
---
Current classes have more movement. Encounters are designed with far more movement REQUIRED. This is why classes have movement. 
---
You DO NOT have more movement to help you make up for mistakes than in classic. You have LESS.
---
Classic is far more forgiving due to tuning. On live classes have movement because they NEED movement and they are EXPECTED and the game is BALANCED around them using it.
---
Regardless, that doesn't make your statement any less stupid. But we've established that you simply worded it like an idiot.
---
&gt;Nope, what I'm saying is factually correct and despite my numerous attempts, you've been unable to grasp the difference between what I said and what you think I said.
---
Actually, you've pretty clearly shown that you just said something stupid. That's ok.
---
&gt;and being able to correct your position is wrong in a situation where your position is wrong at no cost vs not being able to do so does not make it more punishing to position yourself wrong in the latter situation compared to the former?
---
I love that you've just made some cute little fictional scenario again which fits your narrative. 
---
If i then pose a scenario where you use your movement to correct your positioning and then the movement mechanic happens and you no longer have your movement ability thus you have to lose efficiency you will lose your shit and call that unfair or "constant" moving. lol.
---
It's like you cant see the contradiction there.
---
&gt;The reason it's not going anywhere is because all you've done for the past 24 hours is call me bad and lie.
---
Actually, I've just given you multiple examples and objective facts. The fact that you are bad is simply in reference to your understanding an opinion and its subjective validity. I had perhaps hoped it would help you maybe stop and think and be more open minded but no, potato think like potato. Potato no change.
---
Perhaps this is why you've been playing a game for over a decade and yet you are still awful at it. Food for thought. Although I'm sure you've dismissed that before, and its not your fault or whatever. Or maybe people have tried to help you but you just gloss over it and bombard them with stupidity instead. That would be in character.
---
Thats how I also remember it, however I dont know if that was patched out before 1.12.
---
We're removing PC spec questions for the time being, because there's no info on system reqs yet, so all we can do is guess. Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
it's hardly gatekeeping. a beta is made for testing, and these 'streamers' haven't got a clue about the game, that much is obvious. people circlejerked tipsout's asshole until it was clean and now everyone can see just how garbage he actually is at the game.
---
When I first ran BFD it would be a smooth run until I got to the cultists before the temple and that area would turn into a wipe machine. Learned some tough lessons.
---
what ? an hour a level on live with heirlooms ?
---
1-110 takes like 24 or at most 36 hours
---
Yo can we all just chill a little?
---
Well, I'll be playing it anyway, not as if i'll be cutting edge raiding anyway.
---
Anyone know if you actually need BfA to get access to the beta?
---
Don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre trolling or not. I meant over the span of 15 years not 15 years straight. Look at vanilla videos the players  are terrible they‚Äôre clicking their abilities back peddling  etc but it makes sense because the game was new! You almost never see that in retail wow. Also the same games you mentioned have tournaments going on and the players or cs now are definitely much better then the cs players of 15 years ago, just go watch the majors on twitch! You have me the perfect game example of being getting BETTER at a game that‚Äôs been around for ages. I think you‚Äôre going to get a bit reality check when you realize how many people will be playing classic and how on average they are much better than what you recollect from your rose tinted glasses.
---
&gt; But, those in beta right now are saying it is over tuned. Complaints like this may make Blizzard to reduce the difficulty of certain things in Classic. This a total departure of what the classic community , who have been wanting classic servers for nearly a decade, want. And Streamers that have a large audience will get more attention.
---
everyone who played on Nostalrius had their characters taken away for this opportunity.
---
Joaan got invite today...
---
That's good to know.
---
Rly? Don‚Äòt get why. It‚Äòs not like they will forget about bfa and can make it even worse than it‚Äòs already is üòÖ
---
For mage DPS it's all about having enough fire mages with good crit chance to keep the ignite debuff on the boss.  
---
Then the mage who has the ignite threat needs to pop a limited invulnerability potion when they draw agro and get into melee so they can die without wiping the raid.
---
Then as long as the ignite stays on the boss the majority of the mage raid damage is being assigned to a dead character.  
---
This lets mages exceed the threat cap as a group while also being out of cleave/AOE effects lowering the amount of raid healing that needs to be done.  
---
This means you can swap out two rogues and a raid healer for 2 mages and another ranged DPS to kill bosses faster and safer.
---
Depends if he's crying at anything else other than WoW or if he's just getting carried and doing the same trash he does in live.
---
Maxes out at about 15k regurgitating the same "content" (transmog/mount contests, pugs where he asks for all the loot and making up stories about how he loves classic but never actually played it).
---
yea. cause it's impossible for 2 speedruneers to come to similar conclusions in terms of leveling efficiency.
---
Joana is a guy. He also got a beta invite. So happy days!
---
Joana got invite today...
---
Legit question, what does Weakaura do?
---
You don't know Asmon then.
---
He had a fucking mental breakdown when he lost 2000 viewers playing other games.
---
Money is everything to that goblin.
---
Oh, athene, haven‚Äôt seen this name in a while
---
And just like that, the new Leroy "fail" meme was born.
---
Maybe the Software Coders made a mistake and the program considered that Starter Edition to be an "active sub"?
---
I‚Äôm the same age, 38.  I have 4 kids and work 10 hours a day at a serious job.  I also was a serious raider up through WotLK.  Damn those were some great times.  I still haven‚Äôt found a game that I feel the same about.  I‚Äôm going to try and dedicate 5 hours a week, but that‚Äôs realistically going to be tough.  I‚Äôm probably going to end up questing at work if I can get away with it.
---
Screaming like a sperg because you killed a Paladin with no Blessing of Freedom as a Hunter, and only survived because Judgement Resisted while you were at 1% HP.
---
They also kept killing you over and over after this.
---
Yes ofcourse
---
I contemplated for a short while if I should renew sub on US on top of my EU sub.
---
What does that have to do with the first round of invites though? Lots of people are getting invites right now. My point still stands.
---
Nice edit lmaooo
---
Who's to say they won't make content for classic?
---
It's working for OSRS, but it would require Blizzard to listen to their community.
---
So you're probably right.
---
I don't see Nintendo updating it's graphics of old Super Smash Bros. nor I would like them to do so.
---
if at any point you target something else those combo points should be gone
---
Thank you for you reponds ! Yea for myself I am 80 % sure I am going to play frost (single target), because the grinding spots are going to be saturated and as you say the mobs have more abilities. Just wanted to know the opinion of the community because arcane / frost seems nice !
---
True \^\^
---
I see people saying Deadmines was only called VC because Dire Maul was DM.  First comment was posted a month before Dire Maul came out.
---
Nonsense, a druid can totally keep the tank HoT‚Äôed up but I will admit it‚Äôs not until like level 30 when druids have all there healing spells can they do this.
---
There's something to it though. A level 20+ hunter vs Paladin and Warrior with no Intercept, Cleanse or Blessing of Freedom should never lose.
---
heh you then to ignore all reports from that user. Write user name down on shame wall you can glance at.
---
Chimpanzee that!
---
Well, that could be the case. But Brian Kopp's Guide is not really good. Especially as Joana promised a guide "close to the quality of the horde on" and the alliance one ist just way worse. So i have no clue how he could come up with the same...
---
Did you ignore the part where he was bitching about the group who was most likely doing good?
---
How can you respect a person that pushes the entire blame from himself to someone else?
---
MadSeason already said that if he got in to beta he wouldn‚Äôt be playing it much, so I wouldn‚Äôt expect a ton from him.
---
Lol you loser. Deleted all your comments too.
---
Defenitely go for it! Great game :)
---
That sounds absolutely beautiful
---
Is it possible to buy 1-month worth of credit but save it for when classic releases? Instead of having to subscribe to get in the beta
---
Doing everything the normal way is always the first step in testing software
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä Retail is powerless against my nostalgiaü¶Äü¶Ä
---
If he wasn't so lazy he'd be bigger than Asmon, streamer wise.
---
He's so much less of a whiny bitch.
---
shameless
---
In fairness, from an EU players perspective, I'm happy with a midnight launch. Booked the week off work and whilst I know launch is going to be hella busy, it being so late might make life that little bit easier for me to get ahead of the curve!
---
&gt; You DO NOT have more movement to help you make up for mistakes than in classic. You have LESS.
---
Okay, TIL some is less than nothing.
---
&gt; I love that you've just made some cute little fictional scenario again which fits your narrative.
---
TIL: Scenarios that happen all the time are fictional, link me *any* kill video and I'll find you a scenario where it happens.
---
&gt; all that unfair or "constant" moving. lol.
---
I would love to hear your logic as to how you got to there lmao.
---
&gt; Actually, I've just given you multiple examples and objective facts. 
---
You have, but all those examples and facts have been completely irrelevant to what we're actually discussing, only relevant to what you claim we're discussing.
---
&gt; Perhaps this is why you've been playing a game for over a decade and yet you are still awful at it.
---
What game have I played for over a decade?
---
Frost is also amazing in PVP. In the hands of a skilled player melee classes dont stand a chance.
---
Skorch, I was looking for your stream whole day :D GZ!
---
It's extremely ignorant to make it sound that simple.
---
Would it be faster to die immediately, run across to STV to the spirit healer, and res there / corpse run over to arena to loot chest? Or is that even possible right off go?
---
In my opinion solo speed grinding a mage to 30 is not the normal way. I could as well be wrong though.
---
That‚Äôs what a large majority of the population will do t launch
---
It was always called VC, because of the quest.
---
&gt;Geezers
---
No one over the age of 20 uses the word cringe like that
---
It's mostly triggers and such. So if x is true/false then do y type of stuff. For example you could create a weakaura that shows something on your screen with a sound effect if you reach 4 combo points on your current target. 
---
The functionality is pretty deep though so I can't really summarise it here lol. I'd suggest looking up the addon page.https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2
---
or at examples here https://wago.io/
---
Also anyone who played Vanilla should know Joanas name.  Joana had the firsf premier leveling guide sont to a professional standard
---
I don't think its the same at all.
---
[Backpedaling](https://clips.twitch.tv/SillyIntelligentEchidnaPeanutButterJellyTime) not slowing u down
---
I would bet that the majority will be playing in groups, doing dungeons and pvp as well. Non stop grinding will be a minority I guess
---
You know BfA is dead when half their posts is about Classic
---
The auction house was always through the entrance to the right. 2+2=5.
---
You forgot about preach
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com
---
In the search bar type your first characters name you created. Will show you the date.
---
They are the same guys that bugtested the tauren hitboxes right?  
---
How come it feels like they are the only ones beta testing the goddamn game?
---
You lost combo points on your target if you switched target. So mouse over macro would in this case actually overrule that function and let you blind someone and keep combo points.
---
That is something I (as a vanilla main rogue) would for the sake of Rogues being OP already want to be changed.
---
Your combo points should be removed if you use an ability on another player.
---
Display buffs etc in many different ways,  and perform other actions such as sounds or visual effects on certain things happening.
---
It'd be easier to ask what Weakauras CANT do tbh (within the ToS).
---
You could code A LOT of different things if you wanted to.
---
Typically people use it on live to show their cooldowns/procs/boss ability/buffs/debuffs etc in much easier to see ways.
---
Check out wago.io and see the weakauras up there.
---
*That's a big Chungus*
---
We don't know if it's intentional or not since Blizzard haven't made a statement about it.
---
It does have a noticeable effect on gameplay. Changing targets clears your combo points, but mouseover macros let you bypass that restriction.
---
Like he said in the video, it allows you to keep combo points while also crowd controlling other targets. Perplexity is excited about it because he's already a godly Rogue and this new functionality makes Rogues even more powerful.
---
No it wasnt. Tank didnt even have his defensive CD ability on his fucking bars.
---
Just from the zones he visits it is very similar but i didnt have a detailed look yet, so I just went with what was said here.
---
You think those of us who raided etc were clickers back then?
---
Also the kind of people who make videos are different. Back then anyone and everyone were making videos. Nowadays you aren't noticed unless you're big, as in good.
---
When is the left time you watched a retail WoW video of a tendon nobody? Thought so.
---
I'm definitely not trolling. I'm pointing out your distorted view of how things were back then.    
---
Fun fact, the world wasn't greyscale on 1945.
---
Even the most experienced farmers takes about 9 days /played over \~14 days to get to 60 and layering should be gone by then...  So for normies it would probably take &gt;25 days and for actual gods it'll still take &gt;9 days. or 5 days /played. (I think the WR for 1-60 on a vanilla server is 4 days and 20 hours.)
---
You're overestimating people.
---
Just once only
---
youve never been on a rollertoaster? have you never been to disneyham? youre missing out they have the best ryeds
---
Yes. But I know that its basically guaranteed to not happen since I didn't start during vanilla. I'm just using the time I have subbed to make a bunch of gold on retail to buy my sub for the next year with wow tokens
---
Why is there a leaderboard when y'all should be testing bugs
---
Blizzard has a working 1.12 with working server. They are double checking everything. I wouldn't worry about them changing anything over a couple of scrubs they know are good for nothing more than clicks.
---
And trust me - that's all they are to Blizz.
---
&gt;I may be mistaken, but I honestly thought you only lost the combo points on the target you have some on if you used a combo point generator on another target.
---
That was during TBC.  
---
Before 1.4 you would lose combo points if you deselected the target.  
---
After 1.4, you would no longer lose combo points if you deselected the target.  You would only lose points if you changed targets.
---
it was always DM on our server before and after Dire Maul. Dire Maul was never simply DM, it always had E/W/N/T included, so if it was just DM you knew it was deadmines.
---
first you go frost+fire. improved frostbolt and fireball. cos what will be more effiecent depend on the rank you get at the level. 
---
and in mid 20s you respec to aoe frost. so you could do aoe effectively.
---
even if you won't do aoe farming, if you see like camp of mobs, or plling 3 mobs at once even for quest is more effecient. so if there is an opportunity you could always involve aoeing.
---
Theres something off with this link. I started playing summer of 07 and remember when wrath was announced. I remember the ZA patch dropping while I was in my 50s on my first character. Yet this link is showing my sub activating in February 08. I'm slightly bewildered and jumping to Mandela effect conclusions.
---
Hows he charismatic tho, he rambles on and on, is not that attractive and hes really not that special when it comes to classic content. By far the most overrated 'content creator' there is
---
Talk to blizzard about moving one of those accounts to a different bnet account. Otherwise you will not be able to play together.
---
After 1.4? So this seems normal then because we‚Äôre playing in 1.12
---
Why would he know about rogue procs?
---
How could he know about damage numbers besides spell tooltips?  He tested about two buttons on his way to cap haha
---
Yes Sunder, CoR and FF all stack and were stacked in vanilla e.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psD1JWt17hI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psD1JWt17hI&amp;t=82)
---
\- 4:23 5x sunder, CoR and gift of arthas, Bloodthirst hits for 649 with crusader (same. 
---
\- 4:30 5x sunder, CoR, gift of arthas and FF, Bloodthirst hits for 705 with crusader.
---
That is 8.6% damage (705/649) increase from having FF on top of CoR and 5x sunder.
---
It's his career dude. Can you imagine losing 20% of your salary one month?
---
Blizzard hasn't said anything about that item specifically, but they're basing the game off 1.12 so that means ToBS is already long since removed from the loot table.
---
THIS IS JUST A TRIBUTE
---
I don't disagree with that, but new development as opposed to research to figure out how it existed previously is a slightly different topic I think. I hope they do, and I hope they stay true to the spirit of Classic, but I'm on the fence personally!
---
Y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt start at the age of 3

This
---
No you're right, he's absolutely horrible at the game and have extremely bad knowledge about Vanilla, as seen in his deep dives with good players. Some of the comments or questions he makes in those videos make me question if he even has had a max level character in any expansion... and they somehow chose him for the beta to report bugs about working bosses and ruin it for everyone else.
---
No engineering and consumables don't make sense tho, because these tools fix the disbalance between classes.
---
why can't it be both ?
---
He said he got 13K subs yesterday.
---
This is what they said but I still disagree with it.
---
Whoa that is a new level of kiting!
---
Rogues are the undisputed champion of treasure chest farming!
---
Yeah thats called sarcasm.
---
No, got the invite today, never streamed in my life.
---
Yea even if the grinding spots are going to be saturated or impossible (because of the new mobs abilities) it can be usefull if there is an opportunity = 3 + mobs, your right
---
I‚Äôve been arguing this on twitter all week. And people still think no one wants it.

Hi, /u/Paddy369
---
Lmao I‚Äôve read so many posts on r/wow to the effect ‚Äúvanilla wow is a lot easier than you remember‚Äù. 
---
Completely missing the point. And so satisfying to see a retail player struggle at classic/vanilla.
---
If you find repeating the same sentence about some overblown small detail 10 times entertaining.
---
Priests are pretty great as well. Not nearly the same burst as Shaman but still very decent. A lot higher damage than Druid and Paladin.
---
Level an alt, farm gold, do dungeons and fuck around. The same stuff people do in-between tiers atm. 
---
Classic WoW has a higher capacity to retain players IMO - its not like you spend a weekend at 60 nolifing and come out with full T3. Its a process that takes months to do! 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if people are doing MC / BWL runs all the way up to Naxx to help people gear.
---
That doesnt even make sense. Neither version is an accurate representation of Vanilla but pservers are close enough that the experience there is very relevant.
---
I'd trust a pserver player over what some guy "remembers" from 14 years ago after mixing together every patch from 1.1 to 1.12 in his head.
---
Server and possibly region-dependant. I don't get what the big deal over the DM vs VC thing even is. They both mean Deadmines.
---
I agree with pretty much everything you said and disagree with the certifiedasshole guy. Well said.
---
Yes, it mainly comes from the US. Reason is that you could mistake Deadmines and Dire Maul. But since most people are looking for "DM West/East/North", using just DM for Deadmines is fine, too.
---
He got banned lol
---
The first wave is still ongoing it's just trickling in over a couple of days, like Blizzard has always done.
---
If Joana gets in 1 day later in a 2 month beta it's not shunning or relevant.
---
Sodapoppin's, Staysafe's, Asmon's etc... opinions are just as valid as Joana's when it comes to classic wow.
---
Classic wow won't be ruined or destroyed, just because your preferred "small community figure" did not receive an invite the second the beta came out.
---
If somebody bought BFA last week and got into the beta day 1, his opinion on the game is still as valid as anyone elses.
---
Infamous 2007-2017 wall of no + comments on the announcement thread on the forums and the announcement post on r/wow in 2017
---
They definitely did another wave. I wasn't in when it first started two nights ago, but when I got home from work yesterday, I was.
---
perplexity &amp; tribe
---
I don't think it's intentional and it's probably because of the new macro system. Mouseover macros were not a thing in vanilla, sure you could do them with some weird scripts but I don't think anyone figured this out at the time.
---
Just build
---
Well shroud is a classic example. The guy isn't known for playing WoW. He's a former CS pro and top level PUBG player. What kind of valuable information are Blizzard going to get from him when he's not even prioritizing streaming the beta? He played the beta for like 2-3 hours on the 15th and then went back to PUBG. Seems like a complete waste.
---

I couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse tbh, all it does is create a potential for shit. I‚Äôd doubt they‚Äôll develop Classic any further when they‚Äôll make $180 a year off of every player who plays TBC / LK.
---
Why go out of your way to create something that can flop horribly when you have a guranteed hit? They can‚Äôt do a 360 after commiting to that either, meaning no TBC at all.
---
Really stinks that this guy just had some fun and did what he wanted. What a waste of the first 2 days of the beta.
---
 Shame on him for not being the rigourous bug tester this community deserves!!
---
Crazy to think people want to play the base version of a game........but then wants to use addons with it to make things easier. "It doesn't make it easier it a quality of life addon!" no, it's to make the game easier so you can put more effort into things you think are much more important. 
---
Addons in Classic, G fucking G boys! It's like installing AC into a hot rod, haha, today's gamers.
---
yes send me 100 dollarinos and i will give you beta access starting august 30th
---
‚ÄúEasily avoided‚Äù lol k bossman.
---
Nice edit, but it doesn't take away from their fun now does it.
---
Man that was the wildest part. I had to go through and redo all my settings first thing. I'm still not sure I have it perfect.
---
Resto /Ele
---
Only NA has ever called it VC, the rest of the world calls it DM
---
Not so much that in-house does better in finding them, as you are right that its impossible in just pure man hours to have that kind of coverage, but not very many players are great at communicating clearly how to reproduce issues or go further beyond some surface investigation. All the bugs found in beta by players probably still has to go through some internal QA to be rewritten and submitted into their database. 
---
What I'm more getting at that Blizzard are most likely aware that majority of their beta testers are not submitting unique tickets or digging for bugs, but even the ones that don't are still providing useful data regardless. Getting mad at players who are not being paid to grind out bugs for not doing good QA is probably unnecessary.
---
Meh, he can be pretty nutty about how exciting things are. He does theorycraft, though. At least he contributes knowledge to the community unlike a certain moneyfirst internet greenhorn.
---
you can farm ok as any healer.
---
but if you mean proper pvp as a damage dealer but also heal raids in the same spec then 30/0/21 shammy or heart of the wild druid.
---
Blizzard has the correct values and spells that aren't on pservers. For example no one has ever done a good Onyxia fight. I think Nano from Nost said in a interview when he talked to someone from Blizzard (I think it was Ion). They did it wrong. What is the chance that Ironfoe will strike the second one? Does anyone know? I think not. And there are plenty more. That is the thing. I didn't say who to trust. I just said who identifies as a veteran.
---
I presume you posted the picture of that ungodly abomination to deter people from rolling troll priest.
---
retail leveling: hey im here to pay my $50 for max level
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i do enjoy the streams. I just hate stupid clickbaits like these.
---
Vanilla had some of the most OP addons in all of WoWs history due to lax Lua restrictions.
---
1 button mega-macros. Auto target healing. Auto-decurse. Auction house addons that GoldmanSachs would kill for now.
---
08/02/2007 I was sure it was much earlier then that.
---
since 2005 my server always called it DM, dire maul would be DME or DMN etc
---
Lol what? It's still there and if you lvl alts through dungeons in retail you should jump no problem. I fell there only once - when I was running WC for the first time in my life back in 2005 and nobody told me about it
---
That'll be an achievement considering it's locked to 30
---
Just straight up call it "deadmines", probalem solved and everyone gets you. Is it so hard to type? 
---
you don't need abberation for an instance you don't do frequently. you'll do it once, maybe twice while leveling.
---
 His goal is to milk as much money off of classic crowd, not to actually play game and be good at it.
---
the whole idea is pretty ridicilous in context of vanilla. but I looked a little bit into it and came up with this: [https://imgur.com/a/PnoE6Zw](https://imgur.com/a/PnoE6Zw)  
---
t2 pally with other spelldamage items could get 576 spelldamage with flask  
---
holy shock is an instant cast and because of that has a 43% spelldamage coefficient
---
rank 3 holy shock hits for 426
---
rank 3 holy shock  hits for 739 with 576 spelldamage
---
crits are only 1.5 the normal damage because paladin doesn't have a talant to increase it to 200%
---
you will crit for about 1000. a fresh level 60 has 3-4k life. I hope this answers the question.
---
btw: gnomish death ray can crit for 4k
---
Filthy alliance noobs called it VC
---
Talisman of Binding Shard never dropped once per server, it dropped once ever and it was a mistake, why would they reintroduce old bugs?
---
&gt; If Joana gets in 1 day later in a 2 month beta it's not shunning or relevant.
---
Except it's 48 hours later, not one day. It doesn't matter how to kick it because it's still a shun when you look at the bigger picture. Popularity on twitch reigns supreme...
---
&gt; Sodapoppin's, Staysafe's, Asmon's etc... opinions are just as valid as Joana's when it comes to classic wow. 
---
True. If they report things that is. I watched staysafe completely disregard graphical glitches in stormwind (shadows were bugged on ultra settings). That's not saying they're all guilty of dismissing problems though. I'm just stating what I witnessed.
---
Only white supremacist care about privacy
---
Pretty sure casting any spell will break shadowmeld, I know it does on a druid.
---
people in r/wow get upset when you talk about classic outside of specific classic posts so it's no surprise people come over here now lol
---
Love madseasons

how about vanish + mouseover sap, yeah that shit needs to go.

Because the meme team is busy wiping on Verdan the Everliving.

Eh, maybe every other WoW beta, but a shit ton (about half?) of games have a beta with characters persisting.
---
people also need to realize part of the streamers job is to make it interesting. through the whole run asmongold was saying a bunch of stuff kind of hyping up what he was doing. it honestly felt like watching cartman in the south park episode. its all really useless chatter but its enough to get people a little more invested and hyped about what is going on
---
I‚Äôm talking about videos of the best pvpers back then who were grand marshal. If I compared videos of a rank 1 in retail and a grand marshal then which you easily can with some YouTube searches you will easily see the difference in skill.

Back in the old vanila days people created leveling guides because we didnt know how and where to level. Now its become a ‚Äúi need a guide to level as fast as possible‚Äù.
---
Beautiful. This nearly brought a tear to my eye.
---
Yeah, you're actually giving good advice, certainly doesn't deserve the downvotes. I'm just responding because I'm having way too much fun watching Twitch streamers fail spectacularly.
---
This is the kind of bug testing that is really valuable, missed thinks or interactions with the new client that were not possible in vanilla - i'm sure mouseover macros will be disabled entirely tbh.
---
&gt;Blizzard has the correct values and spells that aren't on pservers
---
Ofcourse, but that doesnt mean that the Beta is accurate. We already know there are things not working as it should. The issue is not that they have the correct numbers, but that the underlying systems that interpret the numbers they have dont work the same way they did in Vanilla.
---
They basically took the 1.12 database containing all the data, then changed it to a format the modern client can read and ran with that.
---
Just to list a few things in the Beta. The damage on Judgement of Righteouesness is delayed. It does not occur when you press Judgement despite every video from Vanilla showing it should occur instantly. Likewise, heals go off slightly after the spell finishes the cast meaning sometimes players die when they should have gotten the heal.
---
when people have UIs that play the game for them it's usually because of weakauras, they're kind of cool to mess with but overall probably make the game a bit worse
---
Nostalgia means to remember something better than it was. You could have spent two hours on a private server to test this.
---
Love it!
---
It's mostly common loss aversion psychology. People have invested lots of time (money) into a game (stock) only to realise it was a bubble about to burst. Meanwhile a newcomer, the hot and sexy classic game (stock) enters the market and everyone is shifting their time (money) to the new superior product.
---
No but, you seem to be upset with the OP for playing whats likely his favorite game after years of not being able to. There will be plenty of people testing all kinds of things to see if its bugged, but he chose to play his way. 
---
If any bugs do occur with him playing this way he can report them, but that is the point of having a decent sample size for this testing.
---
To make sure all the ways that the game can be played work.
---
He tests it by just playing the way he does.
---
My best tip for ya on that is to "Not die." Hope things work out!
---
nobody writes out stockades, it's SWS
---
I read that more like a joke on the world first crowd but I guess it depends on the streamers.
---
So far the only thing that bothered me was all the "in the know" streamer "leaks" and timers that turned out to be a bunch of nothing but view farming before the beta launched.
---
Yeah I found him annoying tbh, I could only handle about 5 minutes of him and his awful chat going 500 miles an hour. Plus he was playing alliance, when I‚Äôd much rather watch horde gameplay.
---
Wait until holding a controller for more than 30min starts to hurt and cramp your hands :(
---
they have done the research and know where people are. its not just about their core audience. Mobile is HUGE in asian countries which have huge markets to tap. there is zero reason for them to no go for it. Them not tapping the mobile market would be as stupid as them showing Immortal at blizzcon.
---
It's crazy that he seems so bad in classic when his content revolves around classic. Of course he didn't play vanilla but me neither (playing as 12y old doesn't really count imo because stuuuupid) but he also played on private servers and like you learn to play there aswell.  They were level 19 and that's not easy in wc. He should have known better
---
your sarcasm got my upvote.
---
I did, but when you've got a 1k+ latency any amount of HoTs is absolutely critical to keeping people alive when stop-casting is nigh impossible.
---
I'm guessing tahat blizzard havent cleaned up the addon api yet, so we dont even know if WA will be possible.
---
I haven't seen the clip but as I remember it from vanilla you would lose your combo points on mob 1 if you used a combo point builder on mob 2. You could target another mob and swap back to your original target and the combo points would still be there.
---
It does break. But you can sit safely somewhere popular near an environmental hazard; cliffs, lava, boats, etc. and make me people jump off.
---
Freaking everyone's watching classic xD
---
mobs that run away don't seem to aggro other mobs when they run near them? happened in a BFD run on soda's stream.
---
Right? Fucking basic mobs 1 or 2 levels higher than you could and would spank you if you didn't respect them in vanilla. Tips thinking he could faceroll a boss with half his gear gone calls into serious question just how much he knows about the game. It's the absolute basics that every player learns within the first couple hours of playtime.
---
B-but that's fourhundred milliseconds of your life you'll never get back!
---
This is literally the only viable news in many many hours of beta testing.  
---
This is what beta is for, not pretending to know everything about vanilla and getting lost in WC
---
Yea, I teased people for using them back then also. Again, such hardcore gamers.
---
You one of the people who claim vanilla raiding was hard? LUL
---
can you link me the max level boost for $50 please, i'd like to buy it.
---
So?  Cosmetic improvements or things like being able to move the player frame are good advances that don't detract at all from gameplay, which is what the real #NoChanges and not the trolls want.  What, do they expect to run in 2004-era toaster graphics for some delusional nostalgia purpose?
---
100% facts
---
Definitely Frost and Madseason. I am not familiar with the other one but glad he got an invite. Madseason is my favorite content creator.
---
And now we can get real evidence if classic is accurate because who else can tell if regen etc is correct
---
Holy pali can be a thing in pvp, but get ‚Äúburst‚Äù out of your head. All the burst videos are basically the equivalent of the sham windfury videos: they cut 90% of actual gameplay to show you those 10 minutes of imba.
---
That said holi pali geared well is decent in pvp, but you will work more by out-living your opponents than bursting them.
---
This might be a weird question. But did you meet a female gnome warlock in wetlands? Where you both tried to get a chest?
---
If so, I saw the other guys stream, but I didn‚Äôt see who ‚Äòwon‚Äô it. So who got it?
---
surprise surprise the streamer is British and he's actually doing something sophisticated and useful, meanwhile the murrican streamers are milking every cash teat they can find no matter how much they have to bullshit everyone
---
combo points are lost when changing target, i'm pretty sure of that being vanilla.  dunno about this mouseover thing, doesn't seem blizzlike to me

One feral one moonkin per raid is, maybe not the best, but definitely not a major hindrance. Good guilds recruit players anyway and very dedicated player who wants to play feral or moonkin can still be a good addition to the raid.
---
It cost's them nothing to get the exposure. It's 100% free advertising. There is no good reason not to do it, other than 420JimmySaltSalt420 on the wow classic subreddit is buthurt about it.

This is exactly how fanatism is bad

You don't understand something so you call it vile?  Go watch beauty and the beast or something to pick up on some life lessons you must have missed along the way.
---
My youngest brother was about 7 in 2004. I was 14 and my parents got me WoW for Christmas. My siblings played on the account (sshh, don't tell blizzard! it's against the ToS) as well.
---
Darkshore is really underrated. The shape of the zone might be offsetting at first, and first timers will definitely end up running back and forth a couple times. But once you have a general idea of how the zone works and can bunch up the quests the geography is surprisingly convenient - everything is close to the path, so you never have to venture far into dangerous territory.
---
Plus I like the general atmosphere and lore. The zone is sad, melancholy, haunting and mysterious all at once. You see the signs of corruption, but you never manage to cure it or learn the exact source. Skeletons of giant sea animals litter the beaches, the remains of a monstrous being is being dug up but nobody has any idea what it is, haunted ruins remains as a sad reminder of what your empire once used to be. You want to know more, you want to help the land, but you're not powerful enough. Nobody is. 
---
Some of the quests are pretty good too. The one where you have to kill the spirit of one man's wife, the whole chain with the skeletons, and then you help a gnome get drunk. Oh, and we can't forget killing twenty bears. That one's a classic.
---
I'm triggered by the lack of RP.

Another dumpster fire

An idiot and their opinion

ah ok, I thought I missed the whole movie

I'm sorry, but this is honestly a waste of time.

You just keep saying more and more ridiculous statements in response to anything I say to you.
---
I could tell you the sky is blue and you would ask me what spaghetti tastes like in return.
---
I can't tell if you are deliberately obtuse/trolling/autistic/legitimately slow in the head but what is clear is that this is pointless.
---
You are set in your thoughts, and nothing I say will get through to you.
---
We idolize tips? I mostly laugh at him and his annoying tendency to overhype the smallest detail, but I got genuinely angry at him reporting Verdan for doing too much damage after vouching for no change. Fucking snowflake.
---
You're right, and let's see if we get any faster times over these next few days from the new waves of beta invites.
---
Seeing as how the initial beta invites were sent to pretty exclusive players, and these players are not necessary driven to level as quickly as possible, I feel like we may not have a representative sample size to determine whether Classic got some values/data seriously wrong that makes leveling much tougher, or if everything is fine and when min maxers join, the time to 30 drops.
---
He probably couldnt see them through the grease haze under his hat
---
Fail? What? Do they know what year it is? You have all the knowledge at your fingertips, that‚Äôs just silly.  Also, from 1-60 you‚Äôll have plenty of practice.  
---
Follow your heart.
---
Morrowgrain research can get you the rep you need.
---
For some reason people who never played vanilla feel like they have to prove that they did, so they start preaching to people about things that they've only seen on private servers or youtube videos.
---
I love Soda, but on stream right now he's talking about how they shouldn't allow addons like DBM or enemy cast bars. This shit all existed in Vanilla as CT Raid, Natur Enemy cast bar. Hell, I used a macro in MC that auto-targeted people with lower than 50% HP and chain healed them. Addons were EVERYWHERE at 60.
---
Even on this sub, this guy I replied to earlier with a bunch of upvotes says "recount is the authentic experience" https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpo19s/working_recount_for_classic_beta_available/envjpm0/
---
Recount literally didn't even exist in vanilla, it's a private server only addon.
---
Even if he did or dint play in vanilla how the hell do you people remember damage from 15 years ago? its completely plausible that he couldn't remember that this guy did a shit ton of damage
---
BC was announced shortly after its release i believe.
---
Yes, it absolutely is!
---
There is.. no mechanical skill in Vanilla wow.
---
I'll be doing this because I don't play games to cater to whims of random gatekeeping manchildren.

---
The old unarmored epic mounts won't be ingame atm.
---
Mounts will be 1000g and riding cheap.
---
My server always called it DM. I'm pretty sure it's entirely server-dependent.
---
I actually wish it was a real remake that improved on/removed some of the design warts of Classic.  It's not really a true remake, since it's keeping all the kludges and flaws to appease the #NoChanges crowd who really seem to want an official private server.
---
What's your point? Both Frost and Madseason ARE content creators.
---
If a macro changes the behavior then it is a bug to me imo now the question is was that in vanilla? Like i don't know if people had those macros back then
---
Realistically speaking the hunter wins everytime unless he's dumb asf though. Like the warrior should almost never get the charge, thus he loses. Paladin has no way to get past a slow without freedom. I'm pretty sure you could even 1v2 consistently if you weren't dumb in these scenarios because of it
---
Yes, and it was worth it because I actually got in. They said the older your account the better the odds and I have a day 1 account so it was worth the gamble imo.
---
Fair points. Iirc LOTP wasn‚Äôt a talent until 1.8, but perhaps my memory is failing me here (also probably selective recall because I was a resto purist and I would rather not remember farming wool cloth for 8 hours a day for the wall and subsequently raiding 6 nights a week through AQ wall progression). Around that time on Eredar we did a 40 druid onyxia run for the lols.
---
So where were all the market researchers years ago when this company was saying shit like "You think you do, but you don't"
---
Platinum's content is just embarrassingly good. He puts so much effort in that you think the next video could never be better, and then it always is. Probably the best creator out there at the moment.
---
If you're making one im keen.
---
I think people enjoy leveling their Alts more than mains because of the rush to get your main to level cap
---
got a clip?
---
Warrning the game could consume your life
---
You don't get it, and thats okay. People don't typically sub for the game, they sub for the streamer. This is because they enjoy their content, find them funny/entertaining, or just feel generous. I could take shots at people who pay extortionate amounts of money just to watch two and a half men or big bang theory. 
---
One more thing, Jackie:
---
I find it so very amusing that someone on a niche wow subreddit for a 14 year old version of a game where people regularly post and comment about how badly they're going to no-life it is calling people shut-ins.
---
Trolls are cool. Priests are cool. Troll Priests are really cool.
---
With that said. I will be a Tauren Shaman.
---
New models would be great. It lets different versions of the game share graphical assets to save space on computer and server alike, and makes Classic look better.
---
I feel like the comments there are so hateful and hostile, like why the hate? I would not want those ppl in this sub anyway
---
The graphics, aspect ratio and interface addons suggests real vanilla. I may be wrong though.
---
What makes it so funny is that it kinda shows all these "veteran" players likely haven't played Vanilla at all but are basing their vanilla experience 100% on private servers, and are now being shown that private servers got a lot wrong.
---
&gt; I could tell you the sky is blue and you would ask me what spaghetti tastes like in return.

To keep going on with that analogy, this is actually me telling you there's stars in the sky and you going "nuh uh, the sky is blue" you're completely ignoring that my statement is correct because there's exceptions.
---
Well 900 for mounts and 100 for riding. You could get lucky and get baron mount though and not need to do either thing.
---
I bet he had fun lol
---
I'm not the guy, dude.
---
This is why IF was the best city.
---
lol I guess we are, I love the rain IRL too, I don't know why but its a mood booster for sure.
---
On my Server it was called TM, no english realm
---
And there is people actually beta testing the thing as we speak, so ... what does it bother you so much that streamer have acces to the beta only for exposure ? why can't it be both (testing AND exposure) ?
---
If it's anything like old vanilla (idk of they're remastering the graphics at all) you can run it on a toaster . I used to play with a 512mb graphics card, 1gb of ddr 2 ram and a 2.6 GHz single Core celleron.
---
It won't ever drop again!
---
On that fight, at those levels... nah, a druid healer should be doing nothing whatsoever except casting heals.
---
There will be sooo many people who only realise long after that they needed that frost wand from the AV quest or whatever else it may be.
---
I really really need this discussion. 
---
I was a human priest in classic, but will abandon the alliance this time. I will roll a horde priest and the decision which race to play, is harder than I thought.
---
**Trolls**
---
I love trolls. The culture, the ancient lore of the oldest race on azeroth, their style and their racials.  
---
I REALLY want to love them, but they can be so annoying to look at as playable race. Mainly because of their movement and animation. Something about doesnt fit with me.
---
Additionally I would love to roll a troll as shadow while leveling and abusing the troll racials for blackout proccs. It sounds so nice on paper and I heard so many good stories. 
---
**Undead**
---
Undeads are exactly the opposite for me. I am not the biggest fan of their lore. They feel like a designed tool, that was introduced in WC3:TFT just to have a 4th playable race for the horde. They are so damn unethical and anticlimatic to the horde values under Thrall. But I really love their style, movement and casting animation.
---
**Conclusion (missing)**
---
I know, that I will be Holy/Disc in endgame and in that case it just makes more sense for me to roll Undead.
---
Because I can get more from the UD racials in PVP. But but Shadowguard...
---
I would like to hear other opinions about that, because it doesnt matter how I decide, it will be the wrong choice. FML :-D
---
Anal \[Thinderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
Probably more people watching this stream than playing BFA in NA at that point.
---
Yeah when mobs flee they are not going to come back and fight you and they're not even going call other mobs.  
---
Also I'm also watching his stream right now and the mobs hit like a fucking noodle, something is really off...
---
That's tanking 101.  Anything else is a disgrace to being a tank of any sort.
---
Bump.
---
Can you make one, with a elite unit frame , with a warrior icon in it ? :D
---
Lots of gamer dads who hate twitch https://i.imgur.com/ZG5fZjM.png
---
Let WotLK be the last ‚Äúcanon‚Äù expansion for Classic, and let‚Äôs hope they add completely fresh content like osrs
---
The best race against them would probably be gnome for escape artist.
---
i'm sure he's funding a roth IRA or something every month, he'll be OK
---
I think the "surprise" will be so brief, and these expert min-maxers adjust so quickly, that their performance won't change much if at all. Again, I've played on several pservers, and I've leveled many classes back in vanilla, and I simply haven't noticed anything wrong with the classes. That's because the values and stats of everything important to a class (spells and talents values) are extremely well documented, and they almost definitely got all of them right.
---
Remember what makes these guys so good is because they are good at figuring out and using game mechanics. If you give them new values, they'll use the same process to figure out the new ones. Just watch Perplexity or Monkeynews' streams, these guys are completely at home in beta. So I have no reason to believe that anything will change how good these guys are in PvP when Classic releases. I think if you teleport these guys back to 2005, they would wipe the floor with the best players back then.
---
Yeah who would want a spell that instantly makes you immortal to everything, what in the fuck
---
As long as I have 39 good people to do Naxx with I don't care how successful it is honestly, although I would love for them to expand on classic after Naxx but it's highly unlikely even if Classic does well.
---
On EU-Darksorrow it was DM, Dire Maul was DM:E and so on. I don't remember anyone calling it VC.
---
Bro. In vanilla \*everyone\* clicked through it. It wasn't hard then, it isn't hard now.
---
Well, go ahead and just entertain 100k people. Have fun rolling in money.
---
But pservers are being shown to not be as accurate as people think, so that experience is flawed.
---
I've never got that, idk if I'm just a nerd or something lmao
---
YES THANK YOU - TIPS OUT
---
god this cinematic was so freaking cool.
---
Just like those alliance noobs that always run RFC.
---
Its the Americans who call it VC. They also use the imperial system and instead of stopping to use that shit they now base that of the metric system... So with that said. Americans are stupid. I mean they are not ofc. But they are.
---
Potentially flawed recent experience is better than 13 years old experience.
---
This is literally the first time I've ever seen that abbreviation.
---
Stockades = Stockades
---
Deadmines = Deadmines
---
DM E/N/W = Dire Maul
---
VC = Victoria Cross, not a valid WoW term.
---
15.4.2005
---
Im from brisbane, theres a tbc server called [The Barrens](https://the-barrens.org/) and its really good. its based in melbourne i think
---
Talisman of the Binding Layer*
---
I have no memory of Deadmines *ever* being called VC. Is it a modern retail thing?
---
Makes AMA, answers 0 questions.
---
When these people are basically celebrities, they should be held to a higher standard.  Especially since most of them don't deserve that status and essentially get to circumvent the real world thanks to people watching them play video games all day.
---
&gt; Deadmines was called VC before Dire Maul was ever released
---
Yes, and that makes it even more dumb.
---
I thought it had a ton of ads, but I just checked again and it's not that bad lmao. My bad.
---
&gt;poor mmo experience
---
I guess it depends on how you define experience..  
---
If you're looking for interesting mechanical gameplay as an experience then sure it's pretty 'poor' compared to modern games.  
---
BUT  
---
If you're looking for an "mmo-experience" as an RPG, a game to develop a character, progress, make meaningful choices, and sink time into, there is no better mmo-experience than vanilla wow.  Even the slow combat is full of interesting choices, resource management, and very class/fantasy inspired engagement.  Just leveling a class to 60 is a far better experience than modern wow wall to wall as far as an "mmo" goes.  And that's coming from someone who still plays retail wow more than 40 hours a week.
---
Vanilla private servers now tend to make Talisman of Binding Shard drop once (per server) before  **Bindings of the Windseeker** can drop, that is for the once per server part.   
---
It is not reintroducing an old bug, it is part of the vanilla chronology now. As the Hakkar blood pandemic.
---
No, the guy was the least annoying one I‚Äôve seen that doesn‚Äôt constantly refer to the stream and ask for subs/follows. But he does thank you, and even plays with people that on in his room, subbed or not. 
---
I‚Äôve not watched streamers before mixer on Xbox other than watching a YouTube vid for various reasons. I just don‚Äôt find them to be that annoying or toxic ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs because you have arrogant pricks insisting you‚Äôre an idiot and nobody ever called it VC back then. It infuriates me because that‚Äôs all I ever heard it called until Wrath.
---
True, I should have said that I wouldn't bring a druid in that dungeon unless he is lvl 22 or 23. But the tank with the broken armor not waiting for the group to be ready is plain horrible.
---
how in the world did that not get noticed until now.
---
Maybe you should switch the controller tho. Some people have problems with Sony controllers because they are so small and cramp your fingers. Just get an Xbox One controller or even better the XBOX DUKE Controller its like holding a (american)Football with buttons :D
---
I subscribed a few days prior to the announcement of the beta release. Figured it was a happy coincidence. Been playing retail to pass the time. not really sure why though.
---
No one shown him the Murloc, that guys even more of a pain!
---
At first I thought this thread was a friendly joke, now I'm just thinking your a complete fucking idiot.
---
It's not a clickbait title.
---
What other dungeons are called by their last bosses name? Do people ask for CR runs instead of RFK? Or AA runs for SFK? Or MD runs instead of WC?
---
No. 
---
Call it VC if you want, but DM is more appropriate.
---
They mentioned something about keeping prenerf cthun for a little bit when AQ opened
---
This was early tbc iirc. In vanilla if you target something else you lose your combo points.
---
Hi, /u/Gothlander
---
This sub is worse honestly
---
It's a bit of a feedback loop though. We already found some issues due to it as well (wowemu dev)
---
What about the bugs he didn‚Äôt find ?
---
Why are so many people ignorantly dumb on this thread? Yes, easily avoided. Don‚Äôt pull the three at the tent and stay away from the front door by the watcher camp. Not difficult.
---
Not even that. You wouldn't fuck this up that much because the game is different. Like honestly. He just seems to suck. Like i could argue that he actually never played for a bit on a private server
---
Much slower than actual vanilla as well, joanas 1-30 was about 5 hours faster.
---
Refering to private servers vanilla meta.
---
To be fair the healer was also dpsing in half mana.
---
I think the whole party had issues lol, looking forward to release dungeons.
---
Well for one, I never explicitly stated it cannot be both (why you've chosen to go with this narrative is beyond me). I was merely using hyperbole to prove a point. Moreover, it doesn't bother me only. It bothers a lot of people because this is the trend of late. I'm annoyed because this is what's happening with the gaming industry (Blizzard/Activision aren't the only ones guilty of this tactic). They would rather had out exclusive BETA's/Alpha's to people that haven't got a clue. That's setting a dangerous precedent for the future.
---
This is false.
---
1.12.1 introduced new mount skills and repriced mounts - from the patch notes:
---
"However, there will now be two levels of riding. Apprentice riding will cost 80g (undiscounted) and allow you to ride regular mounts. Journeyman riding will cost 900g (undiscounted) and allow you to ride epic mounts."
---
You think that doing a 1-30 run isn't helping with testing?
---
That is for Open Betas, not closed ones.
---
I picked up a fighting game for the first time ever in my 30s. I was absolutely awful at it, but put in the work and now I'm about middle of the pack. So it's still possible to develop those skills!
---
Sad for you guys in America that you have to wait for another 21 months!
---
To be fair, their servers were damaged during a storm. It was rough dealing with those servers until they replaced them but still good times.
---
So? Probably 3/4 of people don't like their job and most of them make a lot less money than popular streamers.
---
he üëèüèæ is üëèüèæ making üëèüèæ fun üëèüèæ of üëèüèæ him üëèüèæ
---
Sure
---
The salt is real in this thread.
---
Okay. Find me *one* such example.
---
Soda is an OG and was one of the front runners to even making classic happen. This is a little harsh lol Jesus
---
How is it listed on your battle.net account page in a browser?
---
I'm getting a solid 200fps at 1440p everywhere with a gtx980, i7-4770k, 16gb ram. If that helps any.
---
I have an inactive 2004 account which was compromised so I have been playing on a 2007 account which are are linked to the same battlenet. Wonder if I will be considered for beta.
---
This guy is such a fraud. I'm getting a huge kick out of this tbh.
---
The dude is simply reporting differences between the beta and the original game, you ignorant twat.  Some of us care about certain cosmetic differences that change the feel of the game.
---
Resubbed when they announced.. Still no invite, been playing since beta vanilla and played every expansion and tested most of them
---
. Sad day
---
\&gt; AMA
---
\&gt; Doesn't reply to questions
---
The only one screaming like a sperg is you lmao, that was a quality 1 v 3
---
Telling it how it is
---
 Yeah blizzard thought it was a good idea to not put in unarmored mounts... don‚Äôt ask me why. It was something I was really looking forward to getting.
---
Didn't he delete sodas cloak as well to try and be funny?
---
He also reported Will of the Forsaken for not removing polymorph /s
---
Nah it‚Äôs 2019 shitshows don‚Äôt have to exsist and shouldn‚Äôt.
---
because they find value in the entertainment they get from them and want to show their support, regardless of how much $ the streamer has.
---
All three classes are fine. It's only a few specs that are not viable like Enhance Shaman for Tanking. It was originally designed for Tanking and in mind but then was abandoned for that purpose.
---
My point was more - I'm shit at games but back in the day I survived on my reaction skills alone. Now I just struggle at the back of the raid
---
This subreddit has been a shitfest for the last couple days because of it. There was even a bit of murmuring on /r/wow too
---
Yup. Use em or lose em!
---
Nobody abbreviated stockades because nobody bothered running it, maybe the worst dungeon in vanilla.
---
I imagine they'll probably do an open Beta layers stress test in late june or july, just to get a ton of people on at once to see if layers work like they're supposed to and servers can handle 15-20k players without setting the servers on fire, again.
---
You don‚Äôt think Verdan hits this hard on private servers?
---
The original servers were damaged during a storm in 04; hence, the constant outages. I remember the frustration of having free time in high school and trying to play lol. 
---
Blizzard has more money, better servers, and they know how popular classic is; I doubt we will have issues.
---
I think ion commented on a constant loop of resetting progression I think he said they weren‚Äôt currently planning on it but we will see what happens after naxx.
---
Plus he has 500 health as a tank? Try to do Verdan with 500 health and you're gonna have a bad time.
---
I hear you man, it's pretty similar in my case as well. Back in vanilla I'd go out of my way to gank people, lowbies even. I had a lvl 30 rogue parked in Redridge for the sole purpose of ganking lowbies. I used to take over Freewind Post on my main with my friends, quite often. Then later moved to the more classical Crossroads.
---
Nowadays though it's completely the opposite. I have a similar mentality that I give the benefit of the doubt and I want people to have fun and play together. I have a bit of a honorable code now to never attack anyone &lt;120 on my main (during leveling it's more of a &gt;4 levels below me). Heck, even if they are 120 I don't want to attack them unless they have at least 150k hp or so.
---
In Legion when I mained priest I'd fly to Hellfire peninsula and check for gankings in progress (2v1 for example) and fly down and put a shield on the guy getting ganked (assuming he was my faction of course). Not touching the other guys, just put the shield and let him, now invincible, hack away. The others can either stay and die from their would-be victim or run away. I thought that it was a fair and fun way to deal with gankings there. :P
---
My pick would be undead. Reason?
---
Like you said, their animations, movement and style is awesome.
---
I‚Äòve played a trollmage in vanilla, always regretted it and later rerolled to undead.
---
Troll for *me* is unplayable.
---
Ehh, the classic team have been very good about listening &amp; taking into consideration whats best for the game. A lot of them are old-heads who were around during vanilla/bc.
---
Yeah, thanks. :)
---
What's payment scheme going to be for someone who's literally never played WoW, but is interested in Classic without Modern?
---
My story is that in the late 90's when I was 12 I racked up about $1000 worth of phone charges in a month connecting to interstate and overseas BBS's. So my folks took my 14.4k modem away and wouldn't allow me to have anything to do with "the internet" until I left home and went to Uni.
---
I missed out on the whole scene, when all of my friends were super into WoW and we were all trying to think up ways that I could secretly get on the internet to join them.
---
By the time I was at Uni it was all too late. The friend group dispersed, I'd never been a part of their WoW experience anyway, and suddenly I had a lot of other things competing for my attention.
---
So I'm really interested in WoW Classic as something of an Alternate History experiment... I still want to have something like that first-time experience which I missed out on all those years ago. I won't be the same, the friends won't be the same, but this is a totally unique opportunity that I want to take advantage of.
---
This is so awesome to read in the Bane voice.
---
This is a topic that has been dissected a million times on this sub. The consensus pretty much comes down to the game isn‚Äôt perfect but is the game we want. If we start letting little changes happen soon there will be more and more and before you know it is not vanilla anymore. We wanted vanilla, we got vanilla. Let‚Äôs keep it vanilla.
---
Yes but it is only for fast leveling and hunter class.. go to try it with warrior.. it is horrible...
---
I'd really like to see Ghangis24 get in.
---
No one has even fucking hinted that blizzard will make changes without first checking the reference client and no one has ever fucking hinted that they would do anything to balance encounters - intact they have said the exact opposite. What the fucking are you on about?
---
Get out of here with that paranoia shit, it doesn't help with the discussion it just causes unneeded fucking drama.
---
Ive never tried wow at all as a kid and got into Runescape because of my brothers, any recommendations on why its worth to pici the game up?
---
This is depressing to see it laid out how far away it still is &lt;_&gt;
---
Not true at all. All warriors should apply sunders right away to get the stacks up. Highest TPS is achieved through revenge and HS spam if you‚Äôre prot.
---
And yet another person being deliberately obtuse to imply that their taste in entertainment is superior to others.
---
ok
---
?????
---
For raiding it typically boils down to warriors are the tanks but they can do too. Of you have a resto/holy spec you heal.  Maybe 1 shadow to buff the locks.
---
No idea how strict people will be in classic but some a lot of specs just arent good.
---
wat....have my upvote
---
Downloading this tonight, great stuff!
---
I fucking love this sub, I really do
---
Imagine calling the deadmines "VC"
---
On the current beta the nights are definitely brighter than they should be.
---
Vanilla druids are not as cancerous as tbc imho, but still pretty elusive.
---
Lol what's with this gatekeeping shit. Is the community here really trying to divide everyone up based on who played vanilla?
---
the only thing I remember hearing was sharded was Trade chat and the AH pools.
---
Not true.
---
You think you do, but you dont
---
I played on both US servers and EU servers, since I moved from US to EU. It was called VC on my US server and DM on my EU server.
---
Do you know if this is intended or posted as bug?
---
These are like coming of age stories. I love them.
---
Non-tryhard guilds will take people like shadow priests to raids. Depends who you want to play with.
---
If you're """serious""" about raiding then don't bother going shadow priest or ele/enh shaman. The rest are fine.
---
You can also play on classic private servers for free today that don't have a level cap or restrictions.
---
I thought those were nail clippings for a sec
---
Fuck you got me
---
Reminds me of [this](https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/06/woman-furious-wore-46-t-shirts-run-marathon-didnt-break-record-9420276/)
---
Impossible for a single person to kill. Not so for a coordinated team of a few people. I would elaborate but I am at work and the video on WSG by Ohh Gee on YouTube will answer better then me in any case.
---
Indeed, i played unhealthy amounts in vanilla and i dont have any idea what it actually was. Best bet is to look for old videos, where stats are shown and see their mana regen rate (somewhat).
---
Too bad most are so potato quality that actually making out what the numbers are is going to be nearly impossible.
---
"In my mind it's get the loot, get the quests done, get the raiding on and get the game completed"
---
A large reason people love Classic is the feel of it. The tone. Obscure weapons, items, skills. Awkward obstacles and specific niches for classes and professions. You change quest areas to display on the map, and it starts being slippery slope.
---
I for one will have a slow, grand adventure getting to 60 and then consider raiding. Lots of people never even got to or cared for endgame content or 'completing WoW'.
---
Was never intended to tank end game, even 5 man. According to the class designer.
---
Vanilla did not have resilience, healers were killable.
---
The default settings dotn fucking matter in the slightest lmao
---
yes.
---
This. And I'm pretty sure the retail WC has a shorter jump.
---
Moving goalposts is pretty much the cornerstone of arguing against classic (was the same for OSRS too if I recall).
---
I'm genuinely laughing at this fraud getting exposed. There's no way this guy played classic when it was relevant.
---
I've never seen SWS in my entire life, EU player. It's either just stockades or stocks.
---
the thing that annoys me about the streamers like Asmon is that he acts all clueless and surprised by everything yet anyone with a brain knows he's played plenty on private vanilla servers
---
[OG]
---
I don't know. I would assume it's a bug. I hope some of the people playing the beta are reporting it as a bug.
---
I wouldn't spoil it tbh. You could do it and get a taste or just hang on for a few months and get the real deal, another opening of the floodgates. It's really something to see.
---
Yeah ps controller is worse for me, I already have an x1 controller though. I'll check out the duke controller thanks.
---
[BFD humanoid yoloing](https://clips.twitch.tv/GoodCuriousTrufflePupper)
---
I can tell you, what is standard viable specs, that 95% of the playerbase play at 60. thats quite simple, if we exclude all the meme specs, special snowlake tryhard and so on:
---
Warrior: fury and prot.
---
Rogue: combat/assa mix
---
Hunter: mm
---
Mage: frost at early tiers, fire at later tiers
---
Warlock: any spec you will spam shadowbolt, specs are SM/ruin or DS. you can say its all destro warlock by its playstyle, cos you dont really dot. but talents itself are hybrid between different specs.
---
Shaman: Restoration
---
Paladin: Holy
---
Priest: Holy
---
Druid: Restoration
---
I dont know, Mcool is a huge bitch when he doesn't get his way.
---
Watching a BFD stream right now... Private servers may have ruined my memory but the waves of mobs at the end when you light the candles don't seem to be doing very much damage at all, even to the non tanks in the group.  They aren't CCing any of them and splitting their targetting and everyone in the group is just face tanking their own mob and their hp isn't going down.
---
Played a mage, it would make sense. I know dual wield required much higher hit, while 2hander requirements are much lower.
---
The vast majority of the people who played/plays on private servers, also played during real vanilla. Does that make them "super veterans"? And what noteworthy value does such a title hold?
---
I don't understand what point you're trying to make, besides trying to make yourself feel high and mighty for playing the REAL vanilla... lol
---
EU 2005ish player, never once saw it called VC on retail. Why would you abbreviate literally one dungeon based on the final boss name? It's not like we called Mauradon "P". Dumb.
---
I for one never got past level 40 or so until WotlK (endless alts...) so will be gunning for Molten Core and trying to get Hand of Ragnaros on my main.
---
Remember when everyone said it was gonna be way too easy? Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
Im pretty sure it's overhyped, it will spike hard but i'd say withi  12 months the player base will have fallen by a lot.
---
greens were always fairly common but not always that good so that enchanters can level their skill.
---
I suppose, I still can't get over the 30 minute flight times, griefing at quest spawns, or how many class builds were useless in end game. It was a great experience for me 15 years ago and my first mmo so I didn't know better, but they've made lots of great adjustments. I guess I just hope wow classic fixes some of these issues rather than just being vanilla wow.
---
Thank you !
---
Dude his contributions are weak class guides with tips for leveling that make no sense. His channel is super garbage.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people saying this is gate keeping. Where does it say you can‚Äôt play if you didn‚Äôt play in vanilla? Where does it say only OGs should be allowed to play. It‚Äôs a joke on all the kids who said they been playing since vanilla yet they have to go back to ‚Äúhigh‚Äù school. There are more doctors and grad students in the wow class subreddit than any other apparently, yet have the mindset of an 11 year old.
---
I think you're missing the point. If money was everything he wouldn't have taken a break. He didn't like streaming other games because his viewerbase didn't resonate with them as much. Dark souls series seems like it's about the only other thing that's worked for him. I watched him play hollow knoght and while he enjoyed it he had maybe only a few k viewers so he said he wouldn't go forward with it to keep his fans happy and entertained
---
Details is only as complicated as you make it. It's hardly overwhelming when the default feature set is basically identical to skada anyway.
---
Wait. In PvE Rogue Subtlety is better than Combat? Same for Hunter Survival and Beastmaster.
---
Where am I?
---
Just having thousands or hundreds of thousands constantly scrutinising your every move.. It takes a certain kind of person.
---
Also, he ressed a rogue as druid, and the rogue was revived with full hp
---
oh jesus what happened to Ireland
---
They ran DM.
---
They killed VC.
---
Idk why people downvote, even if those addons weren't made then discords bots will be made in their place.
---
Dont worry. There are those of us genuinely reporting things that feel... off.
---
Neither does his teeth
---
I'm not talking about big streamers but the ones who can only pull 1000+ viewers with a particular game and cannot really flex out to something else.
---
How was he being a douche?
---
‚ÄúFor real authentic classic experience, please call vc and be a dick about it when someone does not‚Äù /s
---
This statement implies that they don't find value in any low viewer streamer, which is astronomically low as a chance.
---
Search for pats pvp video from classic, regarded as one of the best classic PVP warriors and now search for reckful  warrior PvP video and just compare the gameplay. Now if you could find me one example of a high end classic pvper who had better gameplay than a recent pvper.
---
First (US) launch week they had that loot bug, it resulted in like a week in free time.
---
Im sure my US launch wow account has been hacked long time ago, so cant check it. Cant even remember the account name.
---
So like... arent mouse over macros dead in Modern anyways?
---
Twenty bears. Hah.
---
But yea, really looking forward to going home again :)
---
It's really upset you huh? It's pretty clearly an attempt at keeping the community divided between vanilla players and new classic players. I just dont get why people care so much about who did or didnt play vanilla.
---
Hmm, maybe but considering every spell from frost applies a slow and a chance to root, only escaping one of those ailments isn't a perfect counter.
---
It was not clear from your initial post that you were arguing for megaservers with dynamic spawns. 
---
You were arguing for limiting the number of spawns to the same as with 1 layer. 
---
The way Layers have been explained, they are the equivalent of 3k pop servers.
---
Layers are a way to scale spawn rates according to realm population, in my opinion spawn rates are directly linked to layers if the intent is to get an experience as close to classic as possible.
---
Dynamic spawns would be an alternative method of solving some of the same issues as what layers are there for, but I'm assuming they have their reasons for going the Layering direction.
---
The more you know
---
Cool

nice comment 666
---
As far as I know totems in vanilla works on a 5-second-tick. Atleast tremor totem does.
---
Perplexity is probably the biggest and best rogue pvper in classic and has a bunch of videos out.
---
So you telling me something completely unrelated to my original statement?
---
Sounds about right. 
---
Your statement wasnt "correct" at all. It was just wrong. You keep trying to twist it to be correct, but that doesnt make it so.
---
 Theres oceanic servers in retail i doubt there wont be any for classic
---
The addon didn't stop you from queuing into other premades.  If you knew when they were queuing then you could queue into them with your own team.
---
So even if classic is running on the bfa version, you don‚Äôt need that downloaded? Just a separate 7gb client?
---
I hope they skip TBC and add new content in the style of classic.
---
This is what ppl should be doing in the beta. Test shit out. Not race to 30 with "LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE".
---
Didn't the Thunderfury spam start way later, and not in Vanilla?
---
&gt; Sure, that provides some data, but definitely the least possible amount.
---
Idk it's probably more data than the streamer who played classic for 2 hours and then went back to BFA.
---
pservers usually have the TBC xp tables for some reason, so it's basically double XP than what true vanilla was
---
What does it say when you enter? Deadmines. Here you go. It's DM, like it or not.
---
I can't believe madseason isn't in the beta. His channel might not be the biggest compared to asmon, but damn if his content doesn't shine with the love he clearly has for classic. He makes such wholesome content and is such a humble guy. He deserves it more than anyone.
---
There are many of us that have played since 2004 that love both versions of the game. Just because you don‚Äôt like the current WoW that is about competitive end game play and very casual content with little shared in between the two extremes doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs automatically bad.
---
Why does it have to be one or the other, BFA is a lot of fun, mythic + and the raids alone provide countless hours of enjoyment for non-casual players...
---
The LFG feature literally came in Vanilla back in 2006 lol
---
&gt;hotw
---
xD no
---
HoTW is a feral PvP spec.
---
Because they are scared Classic will kill retail. But retail cant die twice so.
---
Are you being payed to post this by those guys?
---
Imagine losing to a warrior 1v1 as a fucking hunter lmao. Had no idea what to do when he fucked up positioning and got closed on.
---
[Here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425897364) is an example. It's night throughout the entire stream.
---
Today I will run 1 mile in 6 socks but none of them has the same color, bet no one ever did that so gimme my GWR!
---
they aren't taking your nodes. Your nodes would simply be distributed randomly across the layers. Since the server economy is still one economy those resources will end up the market just the same.
---
i.e. if only 5 herb nodes can be spawned at once in X zone, then those 5 spawns will be distributed across however many layers are active and then re-distributed whenever it's time for an herb slot to respawn.
---
same deal with Rares. A rare can only spawn on 1 layer, period, and then is randomly assigned a layer when it's respawn timer is up.
---
the only question is whether or not they'll consider Devilsaurs a node and distribute those those. I don't recall quests needing them, so it's purely for a deliberately intended low supply resource.
---
Pretty sure it was at least called "stocks". But that could have just been a server thing.
---
Hi, /u/DahliusLOL
---
Wow, blowing off my boys the Goblins. Cold.
---
shows as a PTR option
---
Also thanks for WoD, if that expansion wasn't so terrible people wouldn't have gone looking for private servers.
---
&gt; So you telling me something completely unrelated to my original statement?
---
Now I'm confused, all throughout you've been blasting me telling me my statement was incorrect, yet suddenly I'm the one telling you thinks unrelated to the original statement?
---
&gt; You keep trying to twist it to be correct, but that doesnt make it so.
---
Yes, me making a statement and you twisting it to try to show it's incorrect is me twisting my statement to make it correct, I'm sorry but I'm pretty sure you might need help from a professional.
---
At least the Winterpsring Frostsaber is still an option...but you have to sacrifice 666 baby orcs to get it.
---
lmao fucking WHAT? dumbest shit I've ever heard.
---
Yeah, because streamers gives money to people, instead of taking it
---
Well spotted, I'll edit.
---
I think it is worth doing the quest parallel to your normal leveling. You will have to go southern barrens first where you can also get a very good 2h mace from a quest.  
---
Next stop is tarrens mill which has a few quests for early 20s and alot more quests for late 20s.
---
After that it is ashenvale where you can do many quests mid 20s.
---
Last relevant quest is in silverpine forest, combine this with wraping up hillsbrad lvl 27-30.
---
The chain isn't as bad with ghost wolf if you combine it efficiently and don't do anything stupid. You can always set HS in barrens, do quests in ashenvale/hillsbrad and HS back to the barrens.
---
A well played druid is probably the slipperiest class in BGs, but they aren't nearly as ridiculous as they were in TBC. In open world PvP, they are even harder to pin down though.
---
It‚Äôs just more annoying that all these so called ‚Äúgrad‚Äù students keep saying the same thing over and over again. It‚Äôs like they all took online courses with discussions and had to make there weekly 5 posts and instead of making a new post they just modified someone else‚Äôs and put there own verbiage into it. Just funny at this point but yeah I don‚Äôt get why someone would care if they played back then or not. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs really going to matter at all. People act like there a special snowflake because they played something 15 years ago before it‚Äôs was cool.
---
&gt; If somebody bought BFA last week and got into the beta day 1, his opinion on the game is still as valid as anyone elses.
---
no.
---
Is this 2017? That bug was fixed a long time ago. Do you really think that if servers that claim to be blizzlike knew their XP rates were wrong they wouldn't fix them?
---
I use mouse over macros in retail in PvP... why would expext them to be dead?
---
No, healers were killable in Vanilla. Only in TBC did they become highly....irritable..with the resilience mechanic. (Terrible mechanic btw)
---
LOL, I had to go back and check and you're right, he even potted too, then cries about the other guy potting hahaha.
---
You mean the site OP linked? I'm having some serious questions about that too. It lists Combat and Assassination Rogue's **below** Balance Druids for PvE content lol.
---
"It's not gatekeeping!". 
---
Gatekeeps what a beta is.
---
People from bleeding hollow are just twats.
---
Priest damage is fine even if you're not Shadow. Thing is you *can* get away with being PvP specced in PvE as a healer provided your guild is already consistently killing all of the raid bosses every week.
---
In 2004 you had weeks or month of experience playing wow.
---
In 2019 you have 15 years of experience playing wow.
---
Experience makes a huge difference.
---
Oh you mean B&amp;J?
---
yeah i dont see why it would be an issue - outside of a fear of 'well if they'll change that, what else will they change?'
---
so far though i am basically 100% on board with everything they've decided, they seem to be making a real go of keeping it classic and making sensible tweaks here and there.  personally i think layering was the best solution and people are bitching way too much
---
I dont approve a lot of things but this makes zero difference in the long run.
---
Bahaha he actually blocked you? WTF is up with these anti-Classic dorks.
---
https://twitter.com/WeakAuras/status/1129197421936939008
---
I don't know much about Asmongold and he seems to not be everyone's cup of tea, but at least he cleared DM without a wipe.
---
healing stream isn't that great btw. I wouldn't bother learning it to save money for mount. Only reason to use it if there is another shaman in the group that has talented mana spring. I wonder if different ranks of mana spring stack. in that case healing stream is completly useless
---
What is "suggest and invite"?
---
I havnt played retail for years so I have no idea what this is.
---
I was questing and doing some specific zones I wanted.
---
Hey you could be completely right. I just remember testing the poison application thing in vanilla through the combat log and the number of applications were within 3 to 4 applications over the course of 5 mins regardless of offhand weapon which made me think that
---
that icon is amplify magic i think, next to it is dampen magic at least
---
i played a ne priest in vanilla and i remember while shadowmelded that your stealth wouldn't break until your mount FINISHED casting, not when it started. i know it was changed at some point but i'm not sure how it's going to work in classic
---
Artifact had 50k+ viewers at launch aswell :)
---
lmfao don't spill your droolcup there lad. Make sure your helmet isn't strapped on too tight, don't wanna cut off circulation.
---
I started playing late (1.8). By that time people on my NA server were calling it both VC and DM. There was never any real confusion from what I remember regardless of which abbreviation they used.
---
thats insane lol
---
Just watch old videos of fury warriors. I think people think they are difficult because of the stance dancing that is kind of required to play effectively, but you can make some macros to make that easier
---
So you gonna reply to any questions or....?
---
I remember it vividly because back then you had to run that place many times to level
---
Oh holy shit lmao. I guess we get nearly everything then, huh?
---
It‚Äôs fair to point out that being entertaining on stream requires more concentration than one might first think. Sure you can just turn on the camera and play, but that‚Äôs boring as hell to watch and they‚Äôre doing a lot more than that. They‚Äôre trying to hold an interesting ‚Äúconversation‚Äù with viewers via voice and chat on at 15s delay, while also interacting with each other on no delay; I‚Äôm not surprised they aren‚Äôt playing at peak performance.
---
That bug report though? What an entitled, childish thing to do. He needs to man up.
---
I can guarantee you it will break when starting the cast
---
Playing the way he did was a legitimate way of testing the beta considering there are thousands of people who plan to play his way.  All ways need to be tested and discounting the way he is testing is close-minded.
---
Yeah the comic approach with actual informative content is perfect. I had searched for a channel like his for ages.
---
Blizzard/Activision is a company first and foremost. People at the top decided a long time ago that marketing was important (for obvious reasons), hence why there are so many prominent streamers with keys.
---
Sure you can cry and whine about it all day, but it won't change anything.
---
Its inevitable
---
That's a really good point, since they said they are doing the pandemic again this should be done too.
---
I did, but on the pretense that if i didn't get in, i just log into BFA and farm gold for the duration of this sub to give me a reserve of tokens for Classic's actual Launch date
---
With that kind of attitude alot of actual bugs might go unreported. I've been playing wow for 15 years but I have never set foot on a PvE server so this is news to me.
---
Water is wet. Thanks captain obvious.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
As long as it's level 60 and there's people absolutely everywhere I'm happy. One persistent world.
---
Mobs aggro other nearby mobs the moment they stop fleeing and start walking back to attack - the problem wasn't aggro, the mob just never stopped fleeing.
---
Hi, /u/malpighien
---
Its a very poor idea to stream while doing high level content, you cant split your attention very well between tanking and talking. People who do this are dicks
---
The correct Vanilla term used to be "working as intended" lol
---
I assume frontstabbing isnt gonna be a thing in Classic but seem other reports of hitboxes being weird in the beta. 
---
Have you had any problems with backstab angles? I know this was a problem in early vanilla aswell.
---
Also how is energy ticks in the beta? every 2 seconds or main stream?
---
Thx.
---
My question is are you going to answer any of these fucking questions?
---
&gt;makes ama
---
&gt;answers nothing
---
&gt;???
---
That's just Classic WoW in this case, it's a bug, but a Classic WoW thing.
---
This is actually accurate, but it got removed in Cata. I remember people getting cranky about that. Mostly NE rogues. I wonder if it'll be true to classic. I hope so. I want original FKING STONEFORM.
---
Imagine spending free time watching someone you hate play a game.
---
I still use them all the time in retail. Every heal is a mouse over I also use it for taunting, misdirecting and flame shock on my ele sham.
---
You can just tell the way he controls his characters, he has no "game sense". I've had  friends who no matter how much they played, never got good at games, any game (theres nothing wrong with that).
---
So glad resillence is not a thing in Classic, I absolutely loathed it in TBC.
---
Think of it as a stadium where everyone chant and yell and drink beer
---
I have my PC in the living room hooked up to a 65" 4k tv and need to make the font even bigger cause I can't squint any harder
---
Hey mate. Nah I didn‚Äôt get an email. Just my installer had the Beta PTR Classic option. Also from Western Australia I‚Äôve got 500 ms to the beta pvp server lmao üòÜ. Which is inline with Vanilla back in the day on my adsl 256k.
---
It was noticed pretty early, I Just thought someone already reported it, I saw it happened when the servers first went up and the level 3's didn't aggro anything while running away.
---
With 16 slots a few sm/ruin locks can usually use their corruption
---
Twitch light theme DansGame
---
Bonereavers edge, passed it up early in vanilla due to terrible itemization. I‚Äôm getting that god damn sword this time around.
---
&gt; yeah finding people who can keep their attendance up, is harder than finding the perfect setup.
---
The funny thing is that people on serious specs will be serious in attendance and with up to par skills, too.
---
But you casual redditors will be livin' in your own imaginary world kek lmao
---
Being in the beta and just playing normally is part of testing. Devs are still collecting data on those players.
---
I think that's bad advice in all honesty. I would wait for the actual game to be released. If I could experience everything brand new like I did in actual Vanilla again, I would. Trying it in advance would only ruin the "awe" factor.
---
Just do piggy back off of this I assume front shredding isn‚Äôt a thing either?
---
Hmm, my account was started in Jan of 2005, but I don't want to resub just for a shot
---
I was going to scoff at the silly nationalism here, but then I read your username and it just took the whole thing sufficiently over the top for me to upvote you instead.
---
I like how you first typed "It's a pve server you fucking retard", but when you decided to contain some of your autism and erase it, you forgot to erase the "you" üòÇ
---
&gt; the elitist attitude a majority of the neckbeards here have
---
Then why are you even here? Why are you coming to the WoW Classic forum... insulting the WoW Classic community... and then gain 30 upvotes?
---
Man, go away.
---
‚ÄúWarriors are easy for Warlocks‚Äù
---
Dont worry , they have a 1.12 server running and can check if its meant to be like this or bugged. They wont nerf shit because someone cries bugged when he does things wrong. No worries
---
Twitch streaming is not simply playing a game. Asmongold has 20k-30k+ viewers because he is an entertainer. Acting surprised and "experience" it with his viewers is simply more entertaining than saying "yeah, I've seen that a billion times, nothing special".
---
Kinda obvious that no one has to like that kind of entertainment, but it's rather easy to understand why he does it.
---
wow this is retarded
---
Hell yea
---
Have you heard of the high elves?
---
You honestly have made me feel much better thank you.
---
I played with a single horizontal line for 2 years, because I was still in school and couldn't afford a new one.
---
Yes please, the new combat text is horrible, especially on retail.
---
Up until sometime WoD, you could select "Classic combat text" from options. I can't remember the name of it. But I know for sure you could use the old combat text till late WoD when they changed to Legion crap.
---
I have a screen shot of it somewhere home (of the actual option) will edit later
---
I wanted to call him clueless in the first sentence, but then I ran out of polite insults, so I had to restructure.
---
I probably won't sub if there isn't a RP-PvP server.
---
Please tell me English is not your first language.
---
There are three types of beta testers. The normies that will get in and play around and might report problems if they stumble on them. The hard core testers like perplexity who are there to test the living shit out of everything and report every little detail. And the streamers who are there to hype the game. They serve a perpuse. Asmon had 100k people watching last night. That is great for the game and blizzard. All three serve a valid purpose.
---
Why do you feel the need to be so negative. BFA is great for many of us, I don‚Äôt understand what you alt-right trolls like alexsensual get out of being so negative about modern WoW. What are you missing in your life?
---
Nope, never in EU. I played from release, and it was only ever called Deadmines or DM. 
---
Dire Maul was always called  DM Tribute or DM East/West!
---
&gt; wait a minute, where was it now again?
---
So many people after launch for **soo** many things :)
---
I agree with your statement.   
---
Though there are some things devs can't just know via data. For example the missing water in Deadmines &amp; Wetlands, being able to hit by being turned 180¬∞ from the target, the warrior charge bug.  
---
Also I may be overreacting as the leveling streamers may have in mind every bugs they encountered, so let's wait &amp; see, it's only the beginning after all.
---
Stop spreading misinformation if you don't know what you're talking about.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Combo_point
---
Patch 1.4.0
---
&gt;no company has ever released their game again
---
We live in times where that's the norm, what you on about.
---
Unless you mean MMO's specifically.
---
Agree.
---
Yeah definitely should be one at launch
---
I never had enough spirit on my shaman to get much out of it, I stacked intellect and MP5... in my pre-raid gear I had more mana than almost anyone in my guild. Also shamans didn't have any "you get 15% of your mana regen from spirit during combat" talents, and MP5 worked all the time always... so I was real into that.
---
How was the main post not clear enough regarding this.
---
I did. I got in on last night's wave. I played open beta and was active for launch fwiw.
---
I'm so hype and don't want to be at work right now.
---
For now...
---
Using vanish to dodge incoming spells.
---
Using gouge to reset leash points.
---
Sprinting in stealth to see if animations "moonwalk."
---
Hi, /u/AnArtificialOwl
---
Time =/= Skill
---
Thanks WoD, and thanks BfA!
---
With that said I‚Äôll be rolling a Human Paladin.
---
Thank you!
---
Does this still hold up with the 1.12 itemization though?
---
BC and Wrath should be separate servers. But nochanges for Classic.
---
I think the best option is to just have your character cloned to a tbc server regardless if you actually want to play tbc or not. That way, you can start playing tbc, but you can also just play vanilla and ignore tbc completely if you want
---
yeah, was a TBC thing
---
I was saying they should have the same spawn rate for the same server, with or without extra layers. What that spawn rate should be, is something blizzard has to figure out.
---
They can do that with dynamic spawns per population or fixed spawn rates regardless of population... its up to them. What i was saying, that layering shouldnt affect the spawn rates, no matter what the spawn system they use.
---
Thanks for all of the information! I just got into the Beta myself last night and tested all of the quests in Northshire. None of those starter zone quests gave spillover rep, so it must not go into effect until later zones. Figuring out exactly when spillover rep starts and stops will be important in determining just how much of a benefit you receive from questing with factions other than your target faction.
---
Wholeheartedly agree. Can't RP on a PVP server as people don't have the same mentality. Can't go on a RP server, as they have PVE rulesets and don't cater to PVP. Thus which ever server we choose, we don't have access to full content :(
---
Oh, they will have those numbers. At first the viewer numbers will naturally be higher, because the hype hasn't died down then. I guess by November most viewer numbers will average to 500-2k as well, as soon as raids are being entered and TM vs. SS has gotten stale.
---
Don't forget that private server streaming has been a "forbidden fruit" so far, making it so much sweeter to watch than if it were allowed.
---
In the end, it comes down to who is playing then. Sodapoppin and co. are watched because they are entertaining personalities. Others, like Fragnance are primarily watched because of the guild they are in and because of their skill. The same will apply a few months down the road after Classic has launched.
---
I just hope the community stops cockslapping itself by then.
---
Who has ever said that?
---
Yes, the same way all of these "blizzlike" servers have the /sit to proc things like reckoning and enrage.
---
They could fix it, but decided to not do it because people like those. Same thing wth the XP
---
Not true at all.
---
It will be trivial. These guys just did literally everything they possibly could do wrong.
---
And people wonder why we complain.
---
I‚Äôm with you. He‚Äôs a nice guy, he‚Äôs trying to make good content, he sounds passionate and excited. I‚Äôm all for people like that making content. Personally though, it‚Äôs not my style. He will take a single line on a blue post and turn in into a 9 minute video where he recycles the same info in 5 different iterations, interspersed with hype commentary. Some people clearly like it, but it‚Äôs not for me.
---
It was stated that active accounts -or- accounts with a positive balance would be considered. So I threw some money into my Blizzard Balance, so even if I don't get in the first couple months of my sub is paid for already.
---
Who's crying?
---
Dire Maul?
---
Yeahhhhhh pretty sure you don't have anything to worry about.
---
I loved it.
---
There won't be any influence on difficulty.
---
Any reports on Damage, Database Items, etc.. will be controlled by Blizzard with their refrence 1.12 client.
---
&gt; Personally way I see it up to 20-30 if you level alone you likely want to level as 2h fury since the early fury talents are better for leveling and give straight up more stuff. After that arms is just better. With a 2h weapon anger management will be better than unbridled wrath at generating rage, axe spec gives as much crit as crueltydoes but after 40 you can take the fury crit too so it's definitely better (assuming you keep using axes but with ww axe it's worth having initially). Sweeping strikes is super strong and until you really start stacking ap and strength at 60 mortal strike is much better than bloodthirst. You only really miss out on enrage and flurry but with a 2h and no crit-gear flurry will be much less worth than it will at 60 and imo probably slightly worse than deep wounds/impale. I'm going arms straight away because I'm lazy.
---
Wait a minute, then why are you responding to me?  You understand that my whole point was saying that both specs are just as good as one another for leveling so saying one is better, period, is wrong.
---
Go up and read what I was saying because you should have been responding to the guy saying arms is 100% better no ands ifs or buts.
---
What if that boss was bugged, though? The meme team would have found out.
---
this sums up wow pvp perfectly, nothing but douchebaggery from tiny minded humans, pve servers the way to go
---
Sorry dude but you strike me as someone that doesn‚Äôt like to discover things in games. If you know the feeling of reading a quest text over and over to find the hint of where you need to go, that‚Äôs all you need. Raiding is great and it has become Blizzards main reason for the game at this point but games used to be just as much about leveling. 
---
I don‚Äôt sit around with my gaming friends talking about the time I tore down mobs in the newest zone as fast as I could. I talk about that time we ran around looking for the entrance to BFD, and we got loot we didn‚Äôt know existed, and did quests that tied into the whole zone that we just discovered over the last few days. 
---
A very important part of the game is missing right now. 
---
And just so you know I don‚Äôt hate raiding, I did server first Algalon back in Wrath, i fucking love raiding. But leveling is crucial.
---
I hope someone is collecting the beta streamer fails so we can have a compilation of it later on, spearheaded with none other than tips himself.
---
Sure we'll miss some of the convenience of modern wow.  But those same conveniences destroyed the social fabric of the game.  It's not just nostalgia.  I've leveled characters as recently as a year ago on private servers.  The experience is amazing.  The world is dangerous.  Gear is important.  Every level feels like an accomplishment.  Every talent point feels like it's building towards something amazing.
---
To answer part of my own question, I just got into the Beta last night and tested all of the quests in Northshire. None of those starter zone quests gave spillover rep, so it must not go into effect until later zones. Figuring out exactly when spillover rep starts and stops will be important in determining just how much of a benefit you receive from questing with factions other than your target faction.
---
Hello! Waiting you for ages :)
---
Please test 2 things for druid:
---
1. Is it possible to use 'front shredding'? 
---
2. Shifting Cat Form into Bear Form works with one or two action? In TBC you can switch forms in one click, but in vanilla you must switch to humanoid first and then jump to another form with second action. I really hope on classic will be "TBC style" of shifting, at least with macro.
---
Sauce please
---
This. Is. Not. A. Private. Server.  The tuning is way off. Not that he's a great player, but still, everyone who is saying these streamers are all cringe apparently doesn't understand the millions of small things that have changed.
---
Their stance is, that they don't want people to feel rushed getting to 60 and farming gold before the mount gets forever lost.
---
I'm torn because i really wanted the old mounts but also I'm glad I don't feel the preasure to nolife completely. So dunno..
---
Rested XP is actually a nerf in xp. People complained when they only got 75% xp after playing for too long. So blizzard made normal xp into rested and just nerfed normal xp
---
It makes no sense for specs to be more than just a cosmetic difference? Ok.
---
I do understand that this is mostly a PR event for blizzard. If they really cared about BUGS, they would have larger pool or testers making sure of everything is found.
---
They are milking money of the beta, stress tests, name reservations...
---
This is silly
---
it is retarded to want specs to be more than a cosmetic difference?
---
blizz invites mostly streamers right away to the beta
---
blizz chooses worse option layering so streamers can play uninterrupted
---
we got a lot to worry about
---
Lol at people needing their hand held through everything.
---
He literally just made a bug report about how Aku'mai was slowable by his piercing howl.
---
When in fact a lot of low level dungoen bosses were slowable.
---
A quick google search:   
---
 Aku'mai is *not* immune to [Fear](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Fear)or [snares](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Snare).
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Aku%27mai](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Aku%27mai)
---
Snares = Slows.   
---
........And this Tipsout guy has made a guide to BFD on the classic wowhead.
---
Venruki and Cdew are streaming the beta. They actually have played for a long time and I‚Äôve enjoyed coming back to people I used to watch years ago.
---
explain what a beta is for?
---
Are you sure? It was a long time ago, but I recall seeing this while leveling my first character and wondering what it meant. I started mid 2006
---
Exactly this.
---
I mean, circle jerk only applies when shit starts to become repetitive. This is not it. This is a classic hype train.
---
If you don‚Äôt like positive posts right now, I would just stay away. But the Twitch stream having 90k viewers or r/classicwow being as active as r/wow *have nothing to do whatsoever with the concept of circle jerking*.
---
Circle jerking does not even have to be positive. People can jerk each other when it comes to hating on the same thing over and over again.
---
r/classicwow‚Äôs biggest circle jerk right now is mocking Blizzard‚Äôs initial stance towards classic. Like ‚ÄúYoU tHinK yOu dO bUt yOu DoNt‚Äù. Guaranteed karma through a tried and tired joke. This one is not *quite* that.
---
Actually am seeing a lot of cases of mobs being much weaker. Lot of BFD was getting complaints this morning for it. DDay landing at murlocs in elwynn was also somehow easy for level 8s. That's usually lights out too.
---
I miss the classic Priest:  
---
Praystation
---
Don't forget, Tips wasn't at full health, Soda wasn't full mana, and multiple pieces of Tips' gear was broken. All that on top of what you said, being out of range, and not paying attention. Tanks set the pace and he clearly has no idea what pacing means in Vanilla. Coming from someone who touts his Vanilla knowledge you'd expect more, and if things go poorly you'd expect him to blame himself rather than the game.
---
I wouldn't have a problem with any of this if he laughed at himself and agreed what he did was stupid, but he reports it as a bug which is insane....
---
Tbf I had to Google what cosmos is, had never heard of it.
---
It definitely happened throughout vanilla as well
---
double yoink
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to share a battle.net account are you?
---
Only way to gain XP through BGs in Classic would be by handing in the Marks of Honor.
---
Wow Dev: "What if we instead listen to players who AREN'T obsessed with the game.. and make the game for them after vanilla? I'm SURE that won't bite us in the ass 5 expansions from now."
---
We're not getting bgs until p2 I believe, which will be a few months after launch. By that time you can expect people to have at least full dungeon gear plus some enchants. There will be twinks ready on day 1 of bgs releasing.
---
And no you don't get xp for bgs in classic.
---
If you ended up joining a raid guild, I don't think most would mind if you're just muted in voice chat while following out what your raid leader calls out.
---
Tips is a great streamer. Relax guys. No need to raise puthforks over something so silly.
---
What political beliefs specifically?
---
The higher the resolution, the smaller the font...
---
Probably because he doesnt want anyone to compete with. Id probably be telling people its not that much either. Even when I think about it..if someone says they make millions of dollars that makes me not wsnt to ever donate, or watch their stream for that manner.
---
No, I don't think so, that is why we made different accounts back then, but when [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) released we just ended up merging them together, since it was our mother who paid for everything back then :)
---
they said no unarmored mounts because it would result in people trying to rush and get something before a certain cut-off point, so I fully expect they won't bother on the shard either.
---
Pretty much nothing is being removed, only added or moved around.
---
A bigger question is will T2 drop in MC like it originally did until phase 2? They said they'd move some items around but will that include T2 as well?
---
Unfortunately they already said that there isn't going to be one.
---
You do me man then I‚Äôll do you.
---
Sweet sweet justice
---
There hard to kill for sure, but Shamans definitely give them the most trouble. Purge is a bitch
---
Yea you're right about being entertaining. I'm surprised by how good some streamers are while playing extremely demanding games. Like Fortnite for example. If you take your eyes off the screen for a split second to read chat, you could get headshotted and not know from where. 
---
I actually do find Tips Out to be a good streamer because he has a charismatic personality and verbalizes himself well. Other streams of better players are nowhere near as entertaining.
---
He did play real vanilla though? It's not really debatable??
---
Cosmos UI. Was one of the first "all in one" UI tools in Vanilla.
---
Depends on why you are cringing. 
---
&gt;They play the game like in 2005.
---
There are a lot of retail streamers who are playing the game who have never played on private servers and stuff like that, but did play real vanilla extensively. They have forgotten about a ton of stuff, but their actual game knowledge when they get reminded about shit is usually not bad. So if you think it's cringey as soon as someone fucks up or don't know where to go or whatever, not for you, but if you only want people who aren't stupid, then that could still work. I've watched both Sloot and Venruki, and both feel like average/high end late vanilla WoW players in how they play, tbh. So they know the game, but aren't like "masters" of it. 
---
If you want someone who knows "everything" about the game, go find some private server people, not sure how many are in the beta as of now.
---
No problems whatsoever with not talking over voice chat, listening is another matter.
---
Blizz invites a *few* streamers alongside a bunch of other players, and your perception is warped by spotlight bias because those other players are self-evidently not streaming.
---
Blizz introduces layering *at launch* to avoid 3-hour queue times, streamers have nothing to do with it, and layering isn't even enabled in the beta.
---
You're either ignorant or a fearmongerer. Don't make up silly nonsense.
---
Its entertainment. Its like me calling people out for watching a movie, or going to a hockey game. People love watching things they dont know enough about.
---
Vanilla had looking for dungeon in 1.12 üôÑ. Who are you speaking for in this post?
---
I ^would ^^like ^^^one ^^^^too
---
Interesting. You didn't read the whole post.
---
I can see that. Leveling in vanilla was amazing.
---
Guessing he's assuming it'll unlock down the road.. prob. just uninformed tho.
---
A surprising amount of his popularity is due to this sub being endlessly triggered that he exists and giving him tons of free advertising
---
Voice chat can be a pain if raid/guild leader doesn't maintain rules for who can/should say what. But it is an invaluable tool while raiding, take the use of raid cooldowns like mana tide and inervate.
---
I resubbed the day they announced it. I got my invite last night.
---
Yeah the people in this sub like to hate people for next to no reason. Pretty sad that people have nothing better to do than hurt peoples careers.
---
Makes sense. I always made my own right up until ElvUI.
---
Thanks
---
Won‚Äôt really effect you until end game and even then really only ask you to listen. 
---
That said if you want to be ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù you need to use voice.
---
Sodapoppin and Asmongold are both fun to watch imo. Soda atleast knows what hes doing and Asmongold doesnt pretend to know but hes a good player.
---
One for each region. How costly would it be? Can't they do an official poll/vote to gauge interest?
---
Yeah this sub is reminding me of how awful the average vanilla personality was lol. Oh well, still can't wait!
---
No there was definitely random item spam in vanilla. You could also change the name of items in game through a chat command so people would do that pretty often as well.
---
The only one I remember is someone linking ‚ÄúParis Hilton‚Äôs cum stained pants‚Äù on an item.
---
It looks that way, but we are sitting because we are waiting for the next person to challenge us.  We were not camping anyone, the horde was there because they wanted to be.
---
Because most people on pservers are really bad at the game.
---
RIP John Dunsworth. This show had so many hilarious moments. The one takes the cake for me though -[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX2PVVdw1NY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX2PVVdw1NY)
---
People that @ (try to talk to) the streamer are redic, but most of it is providing that just lil bit extra volume, like cheering at a sporting match. Does the player hear you? No. Do they hear ALL of you going nuts? Yes. 
---
Streamers like watching their chat whizz by when they do something exciting. The adrenaline is real.
---
Or just p... Nvm.
---
Music keeps changing as you enter sub zones, noticed it on soda's stream, not sure if it works properly.
---
Most streamers have gf's though tbh.
---
&gt;blizz invites mostly streamers right away to the beta
---
Blizz wants most free publicity, so ofc they invite all wow streamers they can find. They KNOW everyone will stream beta, since loads of ppl wanna watch it. Limit it JUST to streamers so everyone HAS to watch. Get big numbers, attract more ppl to watch etc.
---
Later on you can invite the normies.
---
I don‚Äôt care if any of these fucking streamers get in the beta.
---
Grats buddy!
---
Madseasonshow MUST be in! What a guy is that
---
a low value streamer would be equivalent to something like blockbuster streaming vs a high value streamer like netflix. people will get more entertainemnt out of the latter. hypothetically if these two businesses had a free model with ads, people would pay for things like ad-free streaming, extra benefits like priority chat, and to show their support so the business finds it profitable enough to keep the content going. i can honestly say i get a lot more enterainment from watching twitch streamers than i do from watching other streaming services except for a couple good shows. i laughed harder at an asmongold stream a couple days ago than i've laughed at anything in a long time--i could barely breathe. before that it was a kungen stream that did it to me. a lot of people like me prefer the live streaming entertainment model better than scripted TV and they're willing to throw in a twitch prime sub (like i do), donatae, or pay for a sub to show their support. it doesn't matter how much money netflix or hulu has, people would pay to watch the content. it's not much different.
---
To be faire the hardocre, mythic obsessed guilds will run mythics once or twice a week but I have a feeling everyone and their mother will spend most time in Classic because when not raiding Classic is vastly superior!
---
Maybe the hardcore raiders like that one, idk. But the XP bug was fixed, there's plenty of documentation on it if you google.
---
you're saying that, but it looks like no one in this thread can dig up a video supporting it and other vids make it look wrong
---
The South Shore vs Terran Mill didn't really happen on our server until honor was released.  My friends and I avoided it because it was not fun for our 5 man roaming pvp group.
---
Dude's a bit of a clicker, sure. Don't think I ever even heard of him though but I'm sure he was considered "teh BeSt".
---
Typically good PvP videos come from more complex classes like Druids. Warriors from that time was mostly just crit porn.
---
[Here's an example](https://youtu.be/t4kp7N1BYkE)   
---
Recall. Your assertion was high end PvPers were worse than the bottom of the barrel now. I can't even begin take that seriously. That's just retarded; hyperbole. I'm done. We're done.
---
an interesting thing to mention and im guessing this changed from vanilla, but if you joined a new server and tried to generate a link for an item that hadn't dropped on that server yet, it would disconnect you from game.
---
Could not find the information about this at all, this is huge news to me. Thanks.
---
&gt;people will get more entertainemnt out of the latter.
---
If that were true there would be no low view streams.
---
Esfands character looks just like Esfand lmao
---
&gt; Call out inacurate videos or information, that's fine and should be encouraged. Aside from some light hearted pot shots the "hate" should stop there.
---
Indeed, I'm all for calling out inaccurate information, but the way users on this subreddit do so is just horrible. /r/classicwow's rule 2: "*Be civil and respectful*" means jack shit, apparently.
---
Was not a thing in Vanilla.
---
Everyone that hates on this guy is weird and sad.
---
Serious guilds might take one Shadow Priest.
---
It wasn't in Vanilla so shouldn't be. There's currently a hit box bug as mentioned by the person you're replying to that let's (gnome at least, not sure of others) Rogues Backstab someone whilst they're literally facing 180* away from each other, back to back. That could well be a race size issue, Tauren also have about 20y worth of dead zone for hunters. Like, a Mage could literally blink and that's the distance for a Tauren Hunter to shoot another Tauren.
---
Probably still have to go cat&gt;person&gt;bear if I had to guess, that was a pretty well known thing.
---
The audacity
---
Before, I cringed and just felt bad or kind of angry but this cringe is something really unsettling that makes me nervous
---
The sole reason Blizzard is spending their resources on classic is their belief, that people will migrate over to retail servers.
---
This subs insistence on outdated game play mechanics, like no cross server grouping will only accelerate that process. 
---
Good luck joining a battleground after every server is 95% horde or alliance. Have fun with brain dead raids that will be cleared on the very day they opened. Enjoy the boosting groups selling raid runs for retail gold. Look forward to no new content after ~6 months.
---
I kind of forgot that this sub seems to be more about jerking off about how much better vanilla is then live then actually enjoying or talking about the game.
---
hey, thanks for doing this.
---
--
---
not for rogue/druid however could you test if eating a "Savory Deviate Delight" changes the hitbox size of taurens (back to normal 5 yard cicle)?
---
Play warrior and I'll kidnap your dog. 
---
And pray to God you aren't John Wick
---
Idk he sounds pretty damn serious and begs for subs.
---
A+ nice infograph
---
You guys think asmon remembered everything about vanilla? Not even close. He also played way back then. God you guys are in such a hurry to trash talk people for next to no real reason. He's a nice guy and he's been a hige help for the community. Take a chill pill and enjoy the show till we all can hopefully get in. Have a great day.
---
I never understand that argument to begin with. Even IF its just nostalgia so what? I love this game because of nostalgia. Whats wrong with that? There are still millions of people who love the game then. The reason why somebody loves something does not matter in the end.
---
And as I said its not just nostalgia. But even IF, whats the point..
---
Graduated in '03.  Still have my Vanilla CE box on my shelf.
---
I hope I'll be able to have my panda cub in Classic.
---
Dunno about us servers, but on eu I can't remember it before tbc. Sort of the same time people started saying anal [dirge] and [purge] the Jews
---
You know what I'm sayin
---
Did you listen to the audio on the clip? Didnt think so.
---
"HAHA LMAO KEK I KILLED ESFAND EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A RANGED SLOW AND HE CANNOT DISPEL IT"
---
Thats what it sounded like to me.
---
If he did, this is the first I‚Äôm hearing of it
---
If these streamers are smart, the make a big horde guild and a big alliance guild on the same server once Classic comes out and constantly hunt each other down in the World when not raiding, Guild vs Guild PVP with big named streamers will probably be quite huge!
---
That define mask must have taken ages
---
Facts and data say otherwise...
---
You can play classic with all of the accounts, just like retail. It will list all your accounts under classic. Im sure of it.
---
Why do they have to be fanboys? You should never ever lose against a warrior or a paladin at low levels and yet he did.
---
Even then, the only reason he won this fight was because asmon was just afk tanking a murloc until the hunter came back and 2 shot him, I‚Äôm not sure if that counts as a 1v3.
---
Nost was the funnest I ever had playing Classic wow - crazy to say it was actually more fun that Vanilla back in the day.
---
I hope Classic can hold a candle to it. I'm really gonna miss packed servers
---
For reference, joana hit 30 in about 24:20 hours if my maths right.
---
I'm assuming you don't have access to the original email?
---
I just recovered my old account last night. It was hacked, but I was able to reset the password through my email.
---
I played shaman all through Vanilla, including progressing all the way to the 4 Horsemen. I can count on one hand the number of times we actually had a mana tide. I think I specced for it three times for big progress nights (Nefarian, Twin Emps, C'Thun) but it was certainly never required, and since Tide was limited to your group, it was more based on group mana than anything else.
---
Shamans were rarely placed in healer groups anyway, due to the totems only affecting your specific group, so we wanted to spread out the buffs as much as possible. We usually had 4 shamans (and I remember all their names, Wrait, Hellmuth, myself, and Froststomp, if any of you fuckers are them, you better send me a PM). One in the tank/warrior group, one in the hunter group, one in the rogue group and one that flexed around as needed.
---
TIL not using Google because it spies on you makes you a white supremacist.
---
I wouldn't play on one myself but I really don't see why not have one, especially with such demand for one
---
Monkeynews is good too
---
Gratz bud üëç
---
ahhh that gives me ptsd, i remember having a noob do that years ago
---
Perfect, that only seems logical - thanks &lt;3
---
&gt;i would think voice chat would get out of hand with that many people.
---
You're correct, it does. Often guilds will limit people to only certain callouts, while officers/raid leaders do the majority of signaling/directions. Totally not a problem to just listen in on the voice chat and not speak, but you do need to listen so that you can catch the callouts from the raid leaders.
---
I'd also recommend macroing some important callouts of your own; e.g. if you are a priest, macroing a /w /p /r /yell message to your power infusion; or putting callouts to the tank if you pull aggro. Some way you can let people know important info without having to type it out, if you aren't using any voip.
---
true, i should say that a majority of people would find more entertainment out of high view streamers. not that people with low stream counts aren't entertaining.
---
Really hope blizz breaks this one on purpose.
---
Raserisk anyone???
---
as a rogue main I agree 100% as well. That would be OP
---
It‚Äôs part of the 40 man experience. For 5 mans, it doesn‚Äôt matter
---
In a weird way I feel I will not feel pressured about this too, this is sort of good in a way.
---
That's a lot of assumptions you have to take in order to justify something that wasn't vanilla. Like that's really not something you can just say with absolute certainty so it's a pretty conniving thing to base an argument off of.
---
Also the new models don't line up with the aesthetic of the game at all.
---
I understand to some degree, but hardcore players are going to rush to 60 regardless. If players want to spend their time making money and using it towards a limited time gold sink instead of raising and doing dungeons they should be able to.
---
mp5 &gt; spirit for resto shamans
---
Plays the game for you and wipes your ass essentially.
---
at beta launch like a dozen streamers logged in, which was more people than were in elwynn combined at the time.  yeah, completely random.
---
3 hour queue times are nothing compared to all the other problems caused by layering.
---
layering isn't enabled in the beta because they haven't made it yet, they only decided on layering when streamers went to irvine and complained they wouldn't be able to play, so they came up with that solution.  they don't need it for the beta because barely anybody got in to troll them.
---
They are more fun since you don't have any mounts and less spells and level actually matters
---
I‚Äôm currently developing a quest completionist guide specifically for earning the most possible Darnassus rep through maximum use of spillover rep from all other factions.
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
I just got into the Beta last night and tested all of the quests in Northshire. None of those starter zone quests gave spillover rep, so it must not go into effect until later zones. Figuring out exactly when spillover rep starts and stops will be important in determining just how much of a benefit you receive from questing with factions other than your target faction.
---
i would say MORE ppl will have twinks fully ready when the BG's actually launch (was it in phase 3 and 4 ?). You can use L60's gold to gear them up, have your L60 friends run the instances for you etc.
---
now for me :)
---
If they release tbc later I hope if they could make one change it'd be to remove resilience lol
---
You sound like you could use a pizza ball
---
Who did that? Absolutely no one
---
Whats that addon?
---
I'm not going to lie, I do sort of miss the old ganking mentality. Maybe the whole angsty teen thing was real, because for some reason, making somebody mad was really fun and appealing to my angsty teenage self. I remember even going as far as intentionally targeting hunters' pets because I think the pets would get unhappy even if killed in battlegrounds.
---
Maybe it's a projection thing. As insecure teenage boys, we actually get our egos hurt if we lose in a video game. So we assume the other person feels the same way. And for some reason, "besting" the other person even in a really unfair way like ganking them at below half health gave ourselves an ego boost.
---
I'm really glad I've long moved on from that way of thinking, but at the same time, I don't know if I can get the same enjoyment out of the game now without thinking that way. It's like buy that expensive but awesome transformers toy you wanted as a kid but couldn't afford. Sure we can still play with it, but we just can't get the same enjoyment out of it that our kid self can. I really hope Classic doesn't turn out to be like this for me, it would be really sad if I had to leave Classic behind permanently because my age can't find as much enjoyment from it.

Alliance scum.

He said all betas though, but I'm probably dipping too deep into the bag of semantics at that point
---
I had the coupon from the wow movie laying around, it says it is only useable until october pf 2017, mine still worked.
---
Now i have an active subscription on a 2nd account, but no invite so far.
---
Ive always heard it called VC
---
They are already doing that to some degree. The itemisation of the latest and upcoming raids are definitely inspired by classic for example, with a ton of weird on use and chance on hit effects, not just secondary stats like we have had for a while. 
---
I think that's what pretty much every retail *and* classic fan is hoping for. Hopefully for the next expansion they see what people liked about legion, they see what people hated about bfa, and they will see what people love about classic. And can try to incorporate a good mix of everything, hopefully turning out really well. 
---
Retail Blizzard developers also seemed to have stopped giving a fuck about what people say they want. I think they are mostly doing what they themselves want now, then seeing if it works out in the community, if it doesn't, they scrap the idea. If not many people are complaining, they might continue with it. And that gives them quite a lot more room to innovate than they have had before when they have been mostly trying to "fix" different aspects of the game. Their ideas in BfA were obviously terrible on a lot of fronts, but I think if they continue working like that WoW will turn out much better for it.
---
shit meme
---
warlocks 0wwn
---
seems a lot of the people getting invited this wave were people subbed from 2006 and prior
---
Dude way too relatable
---
Testing bugs and in current times, advertising and building hype. Because things change as time moves forward.
---
They have a working 1.12 Client and they double check everything that is reported if it was like that back in classic.
---
Nothing to worry about regarding the difficulty of the enemies regarding their stats and abilities at least.
---
This was me on a reply to a comment I made on another sub.
---
Or you just use context. If a level 60 is asking for a group for DM I assume he means Dire Maul and not Deadmines.
---
Blizzards greed is the reason this exists.
---
Why did I think this is runescape?
---
Yes, and got in. Have had an account since 2004.
---
I have the same story as you. Raided hard core, launch to wotlk and hung it up.
---
It was like a fun job then. 50+ hrs a week farming, practicing, grinding. Certainly can't do that now.
---
I stayed up playing the beta untill after midnight and I'm dragging ass at work. 
---
I think lots of the nostalgia players will be in our boat and there will be plenty of people in the community to party with and make new friends that can only play a small amount of time.
---
That's my hope. Medium core players. I want to raid again, I know it will be difficult to find the time but I want to find a group that understands (and I'll be understanding in return)
---
I can't imagine why you'd ever put a formula in a db.
---
It opens up way too many opportunities to accidentally clobber your database.  It wouldn't be source controlled.  
---
The only bonus is that it'd be easy to hotfix it by updating the db.  But at that point you could just host the formula stuff on servers separate from the one running the game, and roll those one by one.
---
You pussy
---
??? Intentionally crippling yourself doesn‚Äôt make you hardcore.  Most people just use WA to display procs, buffs and cool downs in a convenient and aesthetic manner.  Do you also click and keyboard turn to impress the ladies with how rugged you are?
---
On the other hand, as someone who PvPed on normal RP servers before RPPvP servers existed, running around flagged and then trouncing the randos that decide to attack you is fun in its own way.
---
You could always split the accounts to their own bnet account. Isn't it annoying that you guys get all the bnet friend whispers that anyone tries to send to one of you?
---
You would lose sharing all the accountbound gear though.
---
Yeah, with aspect you just have to keep the Warrior in combat to prevent charge and there's no way in hell you should ever lose, even against both of them at the same time.
---
I just want to thank these guys for their actual thoughtful testing of mechanics, which is likely something 95% of the current beta participants aren't bothering to do.
---
Has anyone tested the way weapon skill affects chance to miss and glancing blow damage? There are multiple different theories floating around in private servers.
---
My guess is if it is not a pc from 2006 and its a pc from 2014 and above it will run it
---
Honestly if you aren‚Äôt subbed to the best MMO currently available I‚Äôm not sure you are the type of person that deserves to beta test a MMO, as obviously you aren‚Äôt that intersected.
---
"The greatest song in the world!"
---
I hate sodapopping for this reason, he calls things autistic all the time
---
Unfortunately I just don't have the time I used to for games. So if I am going to play classic I'll be planning almost everything out for my game nighta or I can follow his guide and deviate for shenanigans as necessary.
---
I wish I had 40+ hours a week like I did as a kid and I wouldn't worry but I don't. I think I'll be lucky to get 20 hours.
---
Nobody will hate you. Be good at what you do, and you‚Äôll be on a ton of friends list as ‚Äúkickass healer‚Äù.
---
Gratz on the invite, so I suppose it's something like another wave of invites? Since you got yours later?
---
It seems like the recent wave was for people who were subscribed in the early days of vanilla.
---
I got one and 2 of my other friends got one yesterday too.  We all were subbed in 2004 but not until mid-late December.
---
Even if the other guys were not around during Vanilla, they should get  a chance to play it fairly early due to the incredibly popular content they produce for the community and to keep us all entertained while we waited and waited for news to trickle out.
---
In my opinion the best Mage spec is the one you build, on your own, to your own play style and you feel it's the best.  
---
\-&gt; Former hardcore raider.
---
Yeah, no one should doubt at this point that the actual classic launch will be massive. But also, no one should pretend to know for sure that players will stick around. WoD had huge numbers on release (because a lot of old players came back), but that didn't last long. Not saying classic has the same problems as WoD, but we all know there are at least some potential problems with keeping people playing after the initial hype.
---
lmao that's grand
---
i aint wrong tho
---
It has always been that way, so we never thought much of it I guess, haha. We know the same people anyway, so everyone knew that it always was a gamble on who would answer the message.
---
If I really think about it a little bit longer, you are right. Having those mounts on very few players on the servers will elevate those. They will stand out, because the put in the time and effort to grind it out. Excluding them from the beginning is some degree of retail glancing through, were no one can be excluded or discriminated if don't want to put in the effort. 
---
so yeah, i just changed my mind. fuck em lol
---
Well I just wanted to be prepared for the highly populated areas and what not when it comes out
---
Apr 05 here and no invite as of yet. Hoping to nag one before the end of the weekend.
---
frost is great, i love his thematic videos
---
In vanilla i was in a raiding guild that handled EVERYTHING through chat. I was in the same guild from start of MC to midway NAXX. So can it be done, sure. Will anyone do it now ?
---
FUCK NO.
---
How ppl behave in raids is up to the raid leaders to keep under control and somewhat linked what are you doing. Doing that 79th MC run, nobody cares if ppl talk and joke around. But if its your first progress raid at c'thun, you might wanna only have the RL talk and report only major incidents.
---
Are the old poison proc animations still in? I loved the UD cast animation as the poison would proc.
---
I believe this was removed early TBC with the new Mutilate animations, but small things like that really add to the experience.
---
I'm looking around for an official response, I'm not sure if we know exactly yet how they're handling it.
---
are you honestly telling me that if you got into the beta you'd have dedicated your time to finding bugs and reporting them ? I know that's what this betas all about but I can't think of a single person I know who'd honestly say that they'd be dedicating there time to doing that. I'm pretty sure any normal person would play the game as they usually do and if they happen to come across a bug, report it.
---
Hi, /u/RossFromBritain
---
Hi, what about questing in NE zones from level 3 or something and doing all possible quests? Can you reach exalted by level 39 as human or this is just a possibility on private servers with quests giving more reputation?
---
It doesn't play the same for anyone wtf are you talking about.
---
It's used to catch triggers and display information based on that. But it doesn't trigger action by itself.
---
Holy would benefit from trolls berserking
---
&gt;then cries about the other guy potting
---
ye i guess some of the streamers just feel entiteld i don't know what he said after but you could see his bloodpressure increasing LULW
---
Haha man you people sound like bitter old men yelling at clouds. The amount of salt and extent to which you people are triggered by this guy is reaching the level of being full on delusional.
---
Asmongold is a fuckin loser, the fact that people give this guy attention is unbelievable. He‚Äôs like 35 and made a video about how he was pissed at his dad for not paying his wow subscription. FUCKIN LOSER
---
Not true. I'm a no one. I got in same wave at joana
---
Naw, just best on Alliance, though I like Female Human too. I actually really like Undead Female (any caster)  and Troll Male (shaman) for Horde
---
I‚Äôm still undecided between troll and undead myself
---
This!!!
---
My earliest WoW friends didn‚Äôt remember this was a thing. I remember coming home from work and wanting nothing else but to log in. Then bam - couldn‚Äôt play for like 2 days at time sometimes.
---
I definitely don‚Äôt miss it, and I wear it as a badge of honor haha.
---
He literally said in the post he hasnt slept and is going to sleep and will be back
---
Literally all of my time playing from launch it's been called VC. DM makes me think Dire Maul and that's why people switched to VC. Silly? Maybe, but people legit did it back then.
---
asmon, swifty, and soda were the only ones who actually played vanilla and i don't think any of them were even day1 or had played mmos before that. not sure about swifty. tips thinks he's a vanilla player bc he played vanilla on private servers. it's not the same thing. i think a lot of people are upset because they played vanilla and these content creators who know how to stretch out videos and talk over classic wow in order to get on the hype train to make money, who have very little experience with actual MMOS (not modern wow), are in the beta, while not even reporting any bugs like they were supposed to.
---
I‚Äôd love to play the beta too ngl but I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I would just be playing normally. I wouldn‚Äôt really know what to look for bug wise since I didn‚Äôt play vanilla aside from private servers
---
Its kinda sad and funny. This guys has been 1 of the "legit" classic wow content creators and supporters and now he is exposed to be so fucking bad at the game and little to no knowledge üòÇ
---
Asmongold would at least understand that he doesn't know everything about vanilla.
---
Tips makes a video looking at overall damage charts for Naxxramas and pretends he's making a valid list of class rankings. Didn't understand that you can't just look at top 10 fire mage dps due to how ignite works and also doesn't understand that overall damage include trash packs too. In his own video you see the length of overall fights is like 4 hours long and he doesn't question it.
---
He has no clue what he's talking about and yet constantly pretends he does.
---
The majority of people will be playing together. This game is way more satisfying with others alongside you, prime efficiency be damned
---
Glad you didn't say Human as the race, God what a normie race to play.
---
I mean... kinda? There were sure the market for this product was not there. (To confident I guess). We convinced them otherwise, and now we got what we wanted. But yeah, they didn't develop this out of kindness.
---
Agreed
---
The beta option popped up in my launcher last night, have been playing since vanilla (2004). 
---
There was lots of social chat in Elwynn (omg, social chat?), and it seemed everyone playing had accounts going back to vanilla. So if you played in vanilla, check your launcher today, maybe you got added as well.
---
&gt; I'm assuming you don't have access to the original email?
---
Yeah, i dont. I was living in a different city and i think i used my ISP's email as email. Thats long gone.
---
Lol I just saw that on my account too, couldn't even remember why
---
Same.  I have played the game before, I can wait until August.
---
Enjoy being shitty at the game for the sake of nostalgia
---
They aren't going to be able to do verdant, that's for sure.
---
Also, just look at what Soda is doing. Even when the tank dies, he could've saved the group. The other warrior was tanking just fine, but Soda stood there and went "huh?", the other warrior was literally asking for heals.
---
That was in TBC. The progression was:
---
Original: Combo points are lost if you deselect a target.
---
1.4: Combo points are retained until you select a new target.
---
2.0.3: Combo points are retained until you use a combo point generating ability on a new target.
---
6.0.2: Combo points are stored with the player instead of the target (i.e., you never lose them.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Combo_point#Patch_changes
---
late 30s now.  Was early 20s when vanilla launched.
---
Exactly soda is trash üòÇ
---
What are "all the other problems cause by layering" exactly?
---
Still not sure how what I said is entitlement in any way.
---
Besides my original comment I literally said "You are absolutely right"
---
Chill dawg
---
I don't remember that meme.
---
But I do remember the "omg \[Dirge\]!" spam, and "Anal \[whatever\]" jokes.
---
fuck this guy man. he just showed his "original vanilla characters" on stream, and COMPLETELY ignores the chat calling for /played .. fucking just continuing the lie, disgusting.
---
What are these straw man arguments? Where did I say high end pvpers were worse than the bottom of the barrel now? They are definitely bad an probably the same level as average players now, but again understand it because it was 15 years ago when everything was new. Feels like I‚Äôm     Talking to a boomer in denial. Guess we can agree to disagree till the official release.
---
Nah, Druids are killable but their playstyle is pretty similar. HoT self, DoT enemy and turtle in bear form if you think you can kill the enemy and killing them is actually worthwhile.
---
If the Druid doesn't want to/can't kill the enemy they just CC them however they can and run away.
---
Definitely not anywhere close to as strong as they were in TBC though.
---
Awesome thank you for finding this.
---
It also has the mechanical harvester which was immune to a lot of spells. I remember having trouble with it on my mage alt.
---
Feral is a perfectly viable, even optimal spec for a raid though. Higher threat than Warriors while sharing almost no gear, meaning your other two tanks will gear up faster.
---
That effects me because the character I might want to build can't can expressed properly in both- it would require a different setup for you as for me to see the correct thing.  
---
More relevantly, it takes it from having one image of record, in a shared world, to something completely different.  And personally?  I hate those new models.  And I'm definitely supposed to be able to choose how I look to other players- that's a core supposition of the shared world of an MMO.  It's a virtual space, not some kind of simulation where everyone tunes it to their preference.  
---
Even if they had achieved their stated goal of making the new models HD instead of complete redesigns based on a newer art philosophy, it would still not at all be what classic was like.  There's no place for those new models in a vanilla recreation.
---
Don‚Äôt they send an email aswell?
---
Aren't they also just emailing people?
---
I remember reading about the difference it makes for the Frostsaber mount...it‚Äôs tremendous.
---
Bring on daughter VC

Does rp have some in game rules im not aware of?
---
Or, and this is a wild concept, *or* streamers were chomping at the bit to get on immediately, and other players hadn't yet signed in. We have constant declarations throughout this sub of "I GOT IN GUYS". You treat a Triple A company as though they're full of abject softheads. They let in streamers to build hype, they also let in random players to bug test, and long before the game releases, they will have also let in the well-known add-on devs from back in the day.
---
And no, they introduced layering because the *community* went fucking apoplectic after they said they were going to use sharding in starting zones. "IT WILL RUIN MY IMMERSION" they heard in a chorus of rage, so they made an entirely new proprietary system that both preserves session-long immersion and keeps queue times minimum at what is likely to be an absolutely enormous game launch. You've got to be tetched to think that they were keeping sharding until Sodapoppin showed up in a secret meeting and said he wanted fewer people on the screen, so they made a special system just for him and his fellow streamers and literally no other reason. That's absurd.
---
No, fuck that.  The choices matter, the gear matters, the character builder matters.
---
I had to read this 5 times...i kept thinking they were reacting to the pornhub for life thing.  Now i get it.
---
Most people don't just watch one or two streamers. Most people watch a variety of different streamers for different reasons with different viewer numbers.
---
If at any point you watch a low streamer instead of a high one, you're doing so because you consider it the highest entertainment at that moment.
---
That's how he makes money.  Mediocre players selling themselves as experts have to blame everyone and everything else when they fail so they can continue to be financed by people even more clueless.
---
The thunderfury spam wasn't common in vanilla. I remember that starting in wotlk.
---
Until literally 2 or 3 days ago this sub was unlike your average sub on reddit in that it didn't boil down to just a bunch of whiners pissing and moaning about some specific thing all the time. We've now devolved into your standard garbage sub that consists primarily of neckbeards combing each others necks while they circlejerk each other over some shit that no one should give a fuck about.
---
I expected better from this sub, given that most people seem older than the average gamer in here. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.
---
They did find out, he did too much damage.
---
Personally I'd be interested in TBC and Wrath added BUT with everything scaled down to lvl 60. And gear tuned to work with previous ones. Basically expanding the world and the endgame rather than raising level cap.
---
*unzips*
---
None may challenge the **brother**hood.
---
I think it's awesome! Look at the staff AND the wand! So cool!
---
I just hope that modders like shagu gets in. Need em pfui and pfquest at launch.
---
me neither, I just said what the addon does and not that I'm gonna use such addons.
---
to be clear, I wont play classic with such addons.
---
His video about him not getting beta was so well done
---
Idk how so many of you inbred jealous buttholes didnt read his post.   He said he was starting the AMA thread then going to sleep after 30 hours straight of playing and will answer when he wakes up.
---
I have a day 1 account that is not subbed but an active account that I made during MoP. I was invited into the beta last night.
---
Account created 2009, oops I've got no chance then.
---
afaik its the older system with a one-time 20g riding for the race-specific mount, is there a 100% mount riding skill?
---
People say it all the time on r/wow and on the wow forums. People talk about how all the content will be cleared day 1 and that there's nothing challenging in the game anymore.
---
nice rewriting the definition of beta to suit your argument.
---
&gt;  good advances  
---
I don't think so, not at all.  They aren't objectively *good*, they are *popular enough*.  That's pretty solid logic for a living game, but terrible logic for a recreation of WoW as it was at the time.  
---
&gt; What, do they expect to run in 2004-era toaster graphics for some delusional nostalgia purpose?  
---
The game models need to be the same for all players or it simply has failed at recreating WoW.
---
If you genuinely believe BFA is the best MMO currently available, I'm not sure you are qualified to make such statements.
---
The salt is so strong on this sub lol
---
You can scale up the entire UI to accommodate your eye sight. This is quite useful when playing at higher resolutions as well. I'm 42 using bifocals and my monitor native resolution is 3440x1440. Scaling the UI really helped.
---
Everyone worried about how long it takes to level in classic just doesn't get what was so great about classic. Character bond is high precisely because it takes a lot of time to get to max level! Not to mention to gear this character!
---
Whether you take a week or a month there is plenty to explore/discover and do.
---
Don't worry, this will 100% get fixed before launch.
---
This is the worst ama ever. He hasn‚Äôt responded to anyone. Lol. Must have passed out
---
RP-PvP please!!
---
Does not go all the way back for me.
---
As someone that played "classic" from launch(I played a ud priest, druid, troll warrior).   Classic was a grindfest compared to today's version of it, the way they handled gear in those days left a really sour taste in some people mouth's.  If you weren't part of a raiding guild you would pretty much get rofl stomped in a pvp fight due to a lack of gear, this was before the whole HWL Groups farming warsong for months on end managing everyone's honor points on top of playing almost all day, and when you did get hwl you usually had to borrow gold just to buy the armor and weapons.
---
If you do plan on playing save all the gold you get don't buy anything from the ah,  when you hit level 40 you will spend your first 90g on a mount if your honored with your races faction, I've seen people than not have a mount into level 45ish, when you come across resistance gear&lt;fire, nature, frost&gt; keep it in an alt bank.  If they are doing enchanting like they did before the requirement start stacking LBS, and GEE.  Get ready for monotonous spell rotation's, downranking, don't misclick flight path's &lt;hahahahaha&gt;.
---
Getting ready for the whole Shaman vs Pally buff thing once raid times come(I'd take those pally raid buff's anyday of the week).&lt;insert change my mind meme here&gt;
---
So much I wanna put, I would end up writing a wall of text that would make a blind person throw up.
---
True, but that's a bit difficult to put into practice. There would need to be some sort of consensus on which classes are allowed to use certain things against certain other classes.
---
In Diablo 2 we had a huge set of rules for these things because the "base" balance was so terrible (Amazons would have dominated everything with auto-aiming arrows that hit you 5 times and slow you to a crawl). For example, "weak" classes like Paladin or Druid were allowed to have higher physical damage reduction stat then other classes so that they could get close to "strong" classes like Amazon or Barbarian without getting destroyed instantly.
---
Sub 30% HP and fighting 1-2 mobs. Thats when they attack.
---
It certainly happened in vanilla and then moved onto Dirge spam in TBC. Man I miss Dirge
---
It will be one of the determining factors for me.
---
If I remember correctly, I was complaining, that the lock in my RFD dungeon wouldn't use his 'Pagmat', to my friends in Vent, when the lock that I knew told me that was just his Imp's name...
---
üò∂
---
What is the competition? That said I should clarify I‚Äôm talking about end game content as I believe it‚Äôs the most repayable and important aspect to keep people playing past the initial couple weeks.
---
In one of his recent videos he claimed that quest helper arrows were in vanilla. Not much else to say there.
---
Has anyone who is not a NA player (and not a big streamer) received an invitation yet?
---
&gt; Why do you feel the need to be so negative.
---
My comment was the most minor jab imaginable. Why do you feel the need to scroll to the bottom of the comments to search for anyone saying anything bad about BFA so you can white-knight the game.
---
The game is obviously in a poor state in most peoples opinion. BFA certainly is not great for many of 'us', whatever us means in this case. If you like it, good for you, but going out of your way to defend even the most tame criticism of the game just makes you look pathetic. 
---
&gt; alt-right trolls 
---
Are you really about to try and make the argument that anyone that can observe the obvious declining player base is an alt-right troll? Do you realize how insane you sound making an inference like that?
---
Lol right? I find it funny these guys have "GOING FOR WORLD FIRST" in their titles. Like, dude, it's not world first if 99% of the people wanting to play can't even access the game. Try going for world first during the public release.
---
Um. Who?
---
It won't do shadow damage tamed, it will do shadow damage untamed.
---
Best MMO currently available is just your Personal opinion
---
I feel like half the /wow sub comes over here to try and shit on the game lol. All I know is if Classic was released I wouldn‚Äôt be shitting on the WoW forums - i‚Äôd be playing the game.
---
This games too easy!   
---
\*dies 20 times to the elwynn gnolls\*
---
Did you just call bfa the best mmo available..
---
Have you tested if its just the games that are different or if your actual skill level has gone down? For example, Unreal Tournament plays very differently from lets say Apex.
---
f
---
Dec 04 with active sub, but nothing as of yet.
---
layer hopping for bonus spawns, people popping in and out all over the world when they join groups, high potential for main realms to be overpopulated at end of phase 1, high potential for non-main realms to be underpopulated because more people can all pick the main realms, less community focused game with larger realm size, free realm xfers disruption low-pop realm communities after phase 1
---
Troll all the way baby, taz dingo!!
---
+1 for RP-PvP
---
I'm in and I don't know someone.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Surely he means to suggest that a weeks-long temp system to avoid insane queue times is undoubtedly going to destroy the economy forever, make all the level-60-after-three-days superguilds get slightly richer, make it impossible for him to ever have friends again while leveling, ruin ganking forever, and maybe kill his cat for good measure. Because if there's anything that makes other people take a critic seriously, it's echoing the increasingly deranged rants of other frothing troggs in the /new queue.
---
I didn't like hearing the news about layering at all, because I thought it was permanent. In fact you can check my post history to confirm it. Now I welcome layering out of sheer spite because of the cavalcade of unhinged doomsayers swarming the subreddit.
---
Will of Arlokk on a Priest. My inner Druid almost shed a tear. You Priests had Benediction man you didn't need no snake staff.
---
Someone doing a little gunpla?
---
I know my UI was a mess for a long time.  I think I had macros figured out by this date, nothing fancy though.  You watch a lot of videos from vanilla and most of the UIs are atrocious, that's why I asked the question.
---
What's an athene?
---
He was the most known Vanilla WoW paladin in the world.
---
devouring plague!
---
Dont forget that a big part of the dark being super dark was also the terrible monitors we had back in the day
---
Poor tips.  He'd more or less ridden out the negative feeling from his rather blatant cash-whoring entrance into the community.  Most of us were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  All he had to do was not suck too hard.
---
Wait do you have to have a current sub to have a chance of beta?
---
lol wasn't his chest &amp; belt broken? That might explain it, along with a lack of heals.
---
It's not. It's an observation of how betas have been used in the past handful of years vs how they were used initially.
---
2005 sub here, nothing ):
---
"Cleaning up the addon API" entails stripping away features that do not suit classic. ie. LFG functionality, request invite to group calls, etc.   
---
They're not rewriting it from scratch. Weak Auras will be 100% functional, mark my words.
---
Even used pots and lost LUL
---
I don't know why we're disparaging retail. We technically need it to play Classic. And its revenue is the reason classic will exist. Lmao
---
https://youtu.be/gcY7AyFojok this channel has other videos that explain esports/twitch culture and emotes
---
What's better than a Rogue?
---
A dead Rogue.
---
Yeah lmao people in this thread have their head so far up their ass. Like if anything you could say this 100k viewers on stream IS nostalgia and nothing else yet. You‚Äôll be able to say it‚Äôs not nostalgia a year into classic with actual sub numbers at launch vs a year in. A popular streamer getting lots of viewers for this doesn‚Äôt mean shit. But this goes against this sub‚Äôs circlejerk
---
The streamers are being use as marketing devices, not real QA testers. Don't worry.
---
It's a joke bro lol
---
Really odd
---
Reading is hard, okay?
---
Losing 1v3 is easy you egg.
---
Didn't he try to defraud some investors a few years ago?
---
Above poster agrees with you...
---
Haha good one
---
I always turn to gold farming when I get bored. And leveling alts is a huge undertaking. There are those approaches to consider.
---
You will fail, but it will be glorious! Then eventually you'll get good and be a killing machine
---
Nobody knows for sure, but that‚Äôs part of what I‚Äôll be testing out over the next few weeks. I‚Äôm currently updating my guide with reputation values directly from the Beta (ie. the first Northshire quest is now marked 110SW or 110 Stormwind rep) and will be making my way over to Darnassus just before level 7 to work on all starter zone quests in Shadowglen.
---
Learn to read dipshit
---
I doubt that's the case.
---
The only fact we know is, we do not know what the criteria are for selection. 
---
Does blizzard collect hardware data? If they used length of sub for the first waves and crossed that with different tiers of hardware to gauge performance that could be  a reason. The other would be the sheer size of the pool vs available spots. There was a bluepost that selections are automated. So unless they have a running blacklist for private server guys, which seems rather petty.
---
Lolololol sorry we dont want moonguard losers in classic
---
Nov 05 here and still waiting patiently. Then again i'm from EU so that seems to already be a disadvantage.
---
Yup. This is going to be a thing
---
I leveled...I think 4. Every class was at least one level in. I maxed all my profs. I farmed leather, i made items and traded them out. I absolutely don't expect beta. I would very much love it, of course, but blizz doesn't exactly owe me anything.
---
Isn't the expansion 50$? Comes with a boost, which are cross bnet accounts iirc?
---
He was the loudest self-promoted Paladin in the Wrath era.
---
I ..um.. I could do this super easily too...
---
Well the mana regeneration was extreemly slow in classic. But I do not know about those numbers.
---
truth
---
Im a 2005 sub, i hope i get my beta key asap just to try moonwalker...
---
Streamers would be like a new faction of their own. They‚Äôd have to band together to combat the slaughter! I love it... I‚Äôd sub to them just to see that lol.
---
I don't really know why, but I've never really liked Athene.
---
Something about his "Character" just struck me as an ego-filled a-hole that just didn't jive. And then he faked a whole bunch of drama to get attention. =/
---
I don't recall a time when I couldn't act on another target without losing my combo points if I was smart.  They should definitely not start making changes for the sake of balance.  
---
What the video shows, of course, is very much a retail buff that has leaked to classic beta.  I expect them to fix that.
---
A lot of times these formulas are not simply (X/Y)=Z. They are linear functions with several variables/coefficients/divisors.
---
It was like that then and it will be 10x worse with modern gamer attitude.
---
Its not getting unlocked until the stress tests
---
The WeakAuras creator got an invite, dunno about any others.
---
It's only a thing on private servers because MaNGOS core is a gigantic mess of spaghetti code. You could never frontstab on official Blizzard realms back in vanilla under normal circumstances. There had to be some serious lag involved for something like that to happen.
---
For reference, my account was made in November 2005 and had two accounts with active WoW subscriptions.
---
Nah. Just to point out the hypocrisy in you asking other people to do things that you won't do yourself.
---
Oh hey, did I tell you about the time I leveled from 1 to 60 in three hours in vanilla? I totally did it this one time. Prove that I didn't!
---
I would defenitely say WoW BFA is currently the best MMO available. No discussion (IMO)
---
Until Classic Releases and BFA becomes 2nd best (still bad - but 2nd best :D)
---
Blizz said we get our collectors edition pets!
---
3D printer at work + boredom = dangerous combo.
---
Instance resets, do they work like you want them to for grinding gold. Aka go in, do the instance reset, logout. Does it put you outside of the instance with new refresh instance ready to go.
---
That fresh instance part might be bit tricky, but if it says "instances reset" before login, it should be ok.
---
So you're wasting your time crying about something obvious to you. Saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
---
We normally switched groups for tide so normally I was in a warlock group for treat reduction and then i was switched to healer group for tide then back to warlocks. So we cycled the shamans in the healer group. But that might just be us.
---
Saw it years ago and whenever someone says "He potted!" i remember it
---
Yeah, this seems fast. I'm hoping someone can crunch the numbers. There were people watching streams saying it looked too fast, but I wanted to nail this down.
---
A lot of new people came in with the announcement and Beta Streams. Namely, Asmongold and Sodapoppin's fanbase.
---
Yeah, you can have an account that has no Blizzard items on it and get invited, saw it last night, confirmed.
---
Sad.
---
Who cares? Like why would you or anyone go out of your way to care about sometging is silly as this. He's a good guy with a good stream and he is generally pretty knowledgeable. Hating on someone for reasons like this is just sad man. Relax a bit more or you'll get pissed off at every minor detail in life.
---
I love it. I was so sad when they "nerfed" a friggin' cliff.
---
dude this guy just woooooshed you so hard actual
---
Not mobile friendly, didn't see.
---
Will progress stay from beta to live?
---
But I‚Äôm asking you why? Why are you so petty about a game millions of people like me enjoy?
---
Why can‚Äôt both Classic and retail be successful? 
---
The most pathetic thing is you bringing up a different game to bash it in a separate subreddit.
---
Don‚Äôt you have a batwomen trailer video to criticize? I swear you alt-righters are so miserable.
---
we still have periods where the game is unplayable for one reason or another. Don't see Activision dishing out the credits.
---
He's a self made millionaire in his 20s. If he's a loser what the fuck does that make the rest of us?

Hi guys Hobbs here
---
How about the mana burn?
---
Thanks for mentioning this. Speedrunning is a completely different form of challenge. Everything you do has to be optimized and WoW is no exception. Glad to know Joana has speedrunning chops outside of WoW.
---
That‚Äôs you dude not everyone has a memory like that
---
That may be the case but given how triggered everyone here is by streamers it seems unlikely that fans of streamers are the main people turning this place toxic
---
It was certainly a thing from my memory. I believe they called it VC in reference to the final boss Van Clief (spelling?). In modern wow the final boss of dead mines is no longer VC.
---
This is a goldmine.
---
My bad. I read Rank 1 in the context of classic, as in the lowest rank.
---
Okay, so let me get this straight.
---
You are comparing the top ranked players of what has become an e-sport, to mere hobbyists?
---
I bet at this point you're going "Exactly! Finally you get it, it's more competitive now!" right?
---
Except, while true, it's irrelevant. How many are even close to the skills of those at the top? For every rank 1, hope many are slumming it in the lower brackets?   
---
And there it is. The overall will level isn't better just because we have a few e-sport players, borderline or actual professional players. The hobbyists are just as bad now because they're hobbyists.
---
And who will make up ~95% of wow classic? HOBBYISTS.
---
Hey man, thanks for the reply. I guess that kinda solves it then. Appreciate it\~\~

Berserking is useful with 8 piece T2, great for AQ progression for example. When you're farming content and just using Flash Heal as your primary it's not that useful a lot of the time since you're capped by the GCD.
---
Right, I was hoping someone who was really into the regen numbers could crunch this. People were complaining from streams yesterday that it seemed fast, I wanted to get some actual numbers.
---
Is the poison proc hand animation still present?
---
You can see an example here :
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuKhprlDEHw
---
When the poison procs the character does that hand gesture and the hands show the poison around them.
---
Obviously each race has different hand animation. 
---
Would greatly appreciate an answer to this.
---
This animation was so popular that when Blizzard removed it people were injectig files into the game to have it again to the point blizzard removed it entirely from the engine.
---
Ive been refreshing that at times, too :P
---
Wow you guys are impressive! You dislike streamers playing the game normally so much that you subscribed to be able to do the bug testing!
---
What about power leveling implys that no bug testing was conducted? He played the game for almost 30 hours straight. By definition he has tested a ton of the content, and you have no idea how many bugs he has reported.
---
You don't have to test random fucking abilities in the starting zone for 5 hours to be considered helpful for beta testing purposes. Comments like this just show how fucking pathetically jealous some people are around here that they weren't included in the first round of beta invites.
---
Elite mobs?
---
This is just the disconnected culture we live in now.  Outside that streamer that person probably has limited human contact or friends.  They just want to be recognized for even a moment and feel like they are apart of something.
---
Sometimes* it's just someone that really wants to help someone out and throw them a sub or donation because they want to support their content, but I'd say the vast majority is probably younger shut-ins.
---
Link your source?
---
I'm aware item spam was around, but the actual "Did somebody say?" I thought started *way* later, and wasn't in Vanilla.
---
August 2005 here, nothin
---
Aah, dat stun resist. One of the most op shit ever.
---
We are coming home boyz.
---
go suck his dick why don‚Äôt you?
---
Nost was the first time i played vanilla, though i started in BC, which is very similar to vanilla.
---
I leveled BC as Shockadin. The world PVP was very confusing for my opponents lol
---
If you have access Classic shows up in the drop down beside the play button in the launcher.
---
My god, that video sealed the deal for me. It truly cemented the fact that he has zero personality, and a vocabulary of around 10 words.
---
When he gets to ret palas it goes something like this
---
&gt;Unfortunately guys, ret palas are unfortunately not so fortunate guys, unfortunately
---
Unfortunately unfortunate
---
Yes, it was like this in vanilla. We used assist target macros and the like all the time to blind interrupts etc. 2200+ season 1 and 2 and rank 12 honor grind.
---
Then he started a cult in an old asylum building where he guaranteed that people would get laid if they joined. You probably had the right idea from the start.
---
I merely stated a fact. If you don't like him, don't watch his clips.
---
China can't be ignored. It's a fact of globalism. 
---
I don't blame them. I just won't play what's not interesting to me. All I can do.
---
What are you disagreeing with though, he said it requires less skill than getting in NFL, you say he had to spend a lot of hours.  You could also have 0 skill and spend 10 hours a day those two things don‚Äôt contradict each other. 
---
I think they have a point in that, if you aren‚Äôt extremely talented you can still have a pretty decent playerbase or even more, you see asmongold having more viewers than high end pvpers who compete in Arena for example or competitive MDI players.  That‚Äôs the personality part coming into play.  I think Asmongold is skilled but not as far as to call him ‚Äòtalented‚Äô comparable to someone who would compete in the NFL.  That was the point.
---
Well it‚Äôs important to not pretend like you‚Äôre a source of knowledge and experience when you‚Äôre being a fraud. Posting videos with incorrect information is just wrong and that‚Äôs how it can affect the community in a negative way.
---
They seriously removed it? Ugh. I only didn't use it cause the clash of other race models drives me crazy. I can't wait to be a 7 polygon Tauren again, I miss her sweet face so much.
---
He started in BC lol.
---
Used to think Athene was hilarious, now I find him pathetic tbh, he did some scummy shit
---
Kargoz is a really solid guy imo. He‚Äôs strives to make really comprehensive guides and support content for each class, pvp and pve. He tends to bring in and talk with seasoned vanilla experts and long time players, so he does his research. He‚Äôs a genuine dude and the passion is real, you should check out his YouTube channel
---
Handy for pvp I imagine?
---
This is not his first time contradicting himself though. He told all of his fans to right click report a guy during the demo because he was jumping around and "ruining" his dueling tournament by standing on top of the duelers. Dick move? Sure. Deserving of a ban? Fuck no. He didn't break single rule.
---
Yes, there are naming conventions (basically your name has to be plausibly lore-compliant, it's not strict but just no "ipwnu" "bigbeef" etc) and rules against griefing RP.
---
There are elite mobs inside and outside the dungeon.
---
people were /whoing a while into the beta to check other peoples levels.  there like like 150 people who got in at first, if only about 15 were streamers, and if only 1k people applied for beta, that's a huge streamer favoritism that only gets worse if u imagine more people signing up.
---
layering isn't some brand new miracle tech they spent millions of dollars inventing, it's a network design pattern that millions of other softwares use.  not that complicated to set up.  yeah, they can make that decision at the drop of a hat because they're still in the set-up stage.
---
Sooo - he was already with a Group of 4 others and got 77xp on a non-elite.
---
Then he wen¬¥t in with 4 other People in his Group and got 96xp for a elite? Sounds reasonable
---
Not lore in Classic wow tho right?
---
Which streamer? They‚Äôre all insufferable if you ask me.
---
They seem to keep rolling them out
---
Hopefully it'll come then! when did you start playing WoW and are you NA/EU?
---
I dunno I'm pretty sure I played vanilla with no idea addons existing... yes i was a noob
---
Fuck that.  I didn't wait god this long only to have it go to BC.  That said, I wouldn't mind 1 classic server, and 1 server that goes from Classic -&gt; BC -&gt; WotLK -&gt; Classic -&gt; BC -&gt; WotLK -&gt; Classic -&gt; BC -&gt; WotLK etc....
---
I don‚Äôt know what to say dude, I love WoW - moreso what it used to be. I know its not burnout because I love playing on Vanilla pservers. 
---
I‚Äôve been there for the release of every expansion and played through the first raids at least but Legion kept me till a bit after BRC and BFA kept me til Warfronts.
---
Theres not much positive to say about retail WoW and i‚Äôm sure a lot of others feel this way. I still love the franchise but I have zero fun playing BFA..
---
It was speaking of your former statement. It's not like what you're doing is any better you vapid troglodyte, lmao. Imagine being so desperate to one-up a random person on the internet. You're basically arguing for the sake of arguing. SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD.
---
&gt;but the amount of greasy neckbeards in the comments now is too damn high
---
Nah you're just noticing it more now.
---
At least on my server I frequently started the Thunderfury spam in Vanilla and people would follow with other items or questions or random chat talk. I can't say it was a thing for everyone but I was able to experience that in vanilla
---
Making 7.500 + $ for killing a boss.
---
Sweet, hoping to get one!  
---
Cheers for the quick reply my dude.
---
Right?
---
Been trying out classes on a pserver so I'll have a better idea of what to spend time on in Classic. I find it incredibly refreshing to have to read the quest text to figure out where to go. No sparkles, no circles on the maps, no fucking help at all. The Deathguard guy wants you to collect supplies in Deathknell, you need to go to Deathknell and look for boxes with your own eyes. The only help you get is the map labeling the town. Heading to Brill, I actually followed the road and read the signs - it was much further than I thought it was, though it's been years since I played the Undead starting area.
---
Felt like a Goddamn RPG. It was great.
---
I'd get it. You will need the flight paths later, before 40, and can still grind some exp as you run.
---
Wait for all the people who will rush to get their little bit of fame for first Thunderfury or Scarab Lord title or whatever else... it doesn‚Äôt matter in classic tbh. Sometimes I wonder how many people are just playing to enjoy it :/
---
Honestly no. But that's also why I wrote in another comment, that I haven't signed up for the beta yet. I don't have the time to play enough to provide a good amount of data for Blizzard.
---
Probably I came over to harsh for attacking that single person. I was more worried about the mentality of using the beta to test your speed lvl record times or to only duel in front of stormwind. We need the beta to get every issue fixed before release and we as a community need to help Blizzard with that. I didn't mean to attack a single person but to make it clear that we need proper play testing.
---
i lost my old 2004 sub :(
---
Np, love looking this stuff up.
---
Imagine playing the game to find bugs instead of running into walls for hours like a free QA employee
---
This one might be really hard to test but ive yet to see anyone rolling druid on the beta. Really need to know if the Manual Crowd Pummeler works with druid forms
---
Man, I've been pretty unlucky when deciding to come back to WoW. 
---
Like most people Cataclysm wasn't fun for me and I quit. A few years later I started feeling that itch again and came back during the tail end of MoP to play WoD. I remember the hype of WoD during leveling. Everyone thought it was great. But the end-game was severely lacking, which caused me to quit again.
---
Circling back around here a few years later now and my interest is once again rising in returning to WoW only to find out BfA is pretty well disliked.
---
I seem to like wanting to return to WoW during terrible expansions lol.
---
Alexsensual 2.0, but with less toxicity
---
Private Server Leeches crying for WA while they ignore that Vanilla had some of the most OP add-ons ever that makes WA like LazyPig
---
&gt; Imagine they report this boss for "bugs" coz he shits on them, and blizz nerfs it.
---
I'm not on the hate train for specific people. Its way overboard. But this point is really good. Personally I'd love to have a very high tuned classic where none of the dungeons are easy for their level.
---
Best mage leveling spec?
---
Two of my friends got in on old unsubbed accounts.
---
They had to sub in order to login.
---
Also a lot of people reporting this on twitch and forums as more invites go out.
---
i like that everyone is omitting the second word that goes with Beta ... test
---
Aren't auras like the 3% crit only party wide? So you're only buffing 4 people at most.
---
I don't really understand your response lol I'd say beta is definitely the current height of classic wow (classic wow obviously being between when they announced it years ago and now). 
---
The only difference is "retail" RuneScape is absolute garbage and osrs was revolutionary. Classic wow was definitely revolution, but it's still been able to sustain a game that has been very popular from start to finish.
---
Again, I'm saying "just another day in retail", didn't say anything about the height of retail.
---
His gear was broken because the druid didn't heal him because earlier he deleted a blue cape everyone needed and sent the twitch clip to them. Then they waited for an 1 1/2 hr he while he kept dying and getting lost trying to get back. It was frustrating to watch but maybe blame sleep deprivation?
---
Yeah.  They're not emailed, so don't go falling for any spam labeled "Classic Beta code link" or whatever.
---
Well that explains a lot actually
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say they are tongue-in-cheek titles. Not everything is that serious.
---
Nost was amazing, but I do think that it shut down right as the cracks were beginning to show. The server was still growing at a rate that wasn't really sustainable. I remember logging on at like 9am and seeing 12k online, shit was PACKED.
---
[Thundflurries: Bested Blade of the Windsneakers]
---
Genuinely thought it was a given that there would be an RP-PVP server on launch. My friends and I have always played on one and had decided to roll on one come classic.
---
Mine only goes back to 2012 for some reason. I started in '08. Thank you, though, because this does work for many!

---
I have a friend that played in an English speaking hardcore raiding guild in EverQuest back in the 2000.
---
He didn't speak a word of English (and still don't !!!).
---
He told me that when someone asked him something he randomly answered by "yep" or "hehe", that's it.
---
They didn't use audio back then, it was chat only ... but still.
---
Everybody figured out quickly he didn't speak a word of English but since he was good at his role (I think he played a rogue) they kept him.
---
He sometimes played with another French friend that translated for him, or the other English speaking guys would use an online translator to tell him when the next raid was.
---
He has fond memories of it ! :D
---
They said it's not planned for release, and they of course listen to our feedback. They told us to be vocal.
---
We have been, very vocal.
---
Who is this asshat?
---
It was the same up until cataclysm though, but keep gatekeeping.
---
I hate this uninformed meme being parroted that private server players are going to be completely surprised by classic.
---
The biggest noticeable differences are how monster abilities are coded, and armor/resists values (alledgedly) being lower, or at least being calculated differently when reductions are applied. It's not like it's a completely different game.
---
The actual pserver tryhards are still going to absolutely dominate the servers.
---
The real issue is that when auto shot is active and you strafe left, your character does the backpedaling animation. He isn't holding down s to backpedal.
---
Well Shagu has a discord for his addon, https://discord.gg/QTRKanu. If all the addon makers have discord where they talk to each other, i dont know.
---
You are a good writer! I enjoyed this immensely.
---
Ty, I havent ran my launcher waiting for the email...
---
Can you link? The latest info I have is Ion saying "We have no plans for one, unless the community shows demand for it"
---
I use mousover blind on retro
---
No, thats normal. Different mobs give different XP.
---
They unfreeze you too late and classic wow is now on the bfa expansion.
---
And if Blizzard for no reason removed your prefered server type, you'd be like "nah, who cares" for that as well?
---
I wish I played Nost instead of WoD now, granted I didn‚Äôt know about Nost but I still had friends playing so I stayed in retail too lol.
---
Mana regen isn't based on Spirit alone. Classes have "base" mana regen as well, so 14 Mana per tick makes sense.
---
LMAO stay mad dudes, he is only giving wrong reports about a game that is work in progress, and makes videos LARPing as if he knows anything about the game, who cares. OMEGALUL. #TwitchPrime, sub to his Paymetons. Poggers.
---
There's nothing wrong with calling someone out if they're pretending to be knowledgeable about something and presenting faulty logic as a fact.
---
He isn't knowledgeable at all about the game. He just makes videos where he doesn't bother to learn about things and instead presents his interpretation as a fact. He'd rather be lazy and quick than make accurate videos.
---
People like that should be called out so at least some new players will understand not to follow his videos or believe what he says.
---
You can be against someone without personally hating them.
---
This entire sub with Tipsout lol
---
This is exactly where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôd rather start fresh in August too instead of investing time into playing character that will be deleted.
---
Hi, /u/Spoetter1985
---
Its asmongold's fans, have you seen his stream? Even stream chat is toxic
---
Costly? Nothing. They'll just have to swap the server type on one already planned PVP server. It won't cost them a dime, since it'll be full anyway.
---
Agreed!=D just reversed I will love both games and think they compliment each other well.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why everyone here is so negative about games and content they haven‚Äôt even tried..
---
His videos were funny back in the days, he has been wrapped in drama for quite a few years now and I am not even sure where he is at right now.   
---
It seems like he took down his old videos, they are relinked on other channels and he has done much of anything besides his sketchy gamingforgood website .    
---
Hi ex (?) girlfriend, maybe one of the OG of clickbait thumbnail girl, seems to be still streaming here and then but I don't think they have anything to do in common anymore.
---
You summon and make cookies.
---
Meh I mean to each his own. He does over exaggerate a little too much and he complains quite a bit but he‚Äôs been playing forever and he is knowledgeable about the game. Plus he resembles a friend I had that played wow who passed away so it‚Äôs always nice memories for me.
---
Cow aoe stun best. Troll 30% casting for pve.
---
I don't know why people are downvoting you, it's more likely that I'm just a cynical old man. All I really have to go on are gut feelings and a mild hatred for the dude since the video of his I did watch was extremely disappointing and had so much wrong information that was easily fixable. I think it just pisses me off that the guy has an audience and is treating them like idiots, focusing on putting out subquality videos instead of making decent resources for new players. Because let's be honest, there's so much information out there about vanilla that someone who actually tries could make an entire video series of how-to's and introductions even if they never played any type of wow before.
---
Thanks, good to know this is happening. Been curious.
---
That's not even a little true.
---
All it does is allow you to see information and alerts about procs and things in a manner you prefer.
---
It was basically the ElvUI of vanilla, just way, way uglier. Came with a bunch of titan panel plugins too.
---
I'm glad you and your friends got to enjoy pservers, but saying that's why we got classic is a pretty big head scratcher. People have been asking for legacy servers since right around WOTLK. Re releasing a game has been a hot trend in the last few years as well. Also, pservers don't really reflect the vanilla wow experience.
---
The server list hasn't been announced yet. Do the right thing Blizz and give us one RpPvP server per major region. We don't need more than that. We're gonna keep making noise for this until Blizz acts.
---
When did people start using TV resolutions to refer to computer monitors?
---
I'm NA and I started with the final open beta they had before launch.
---
I was playing FFXI with some friends and we threw down on it for a few days and never looked back.
---
Ohhh, don't get it. Of course I get downvotes lol people on this Reddit are so angry. WoW withdrawl at it's finest in this sub
---
I donno man, I've been visiting this sub basically daily since classic was announced. Shits been different since the beta was announced
---
With the begin of BC I gifted my account to my sister, because I rerolled with RL friends on a new server and she was therefore finally able to play fulltime. She was to young to purchase it for herself.
---
So my new account is from Jan 2007. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. :-D
---
But on the other hand, I would have no sister which share my hobby and will likely join me for Classic Release.
---
My bad, why so agro though ?
---
Yeah, but playing years on private servers doesn‚Äôt mean he has  **zero** knowledge about the game either, like the comment I was replying to said. I don‚Äôt think he or anyone is saying he has some magical knowledge and skill.
---

---
The big question is, does he dies to the wetlands crocolisks on his way to Darkshore?
---
Yes? Hence what the post says.
---
The email can appear days after your client updates with the beta.
---
They're "gathering stones" in vanilla. They don't summon, but instead open an interface to find more players to add to the group. At last, that's how I understand it. Flightpaths are still there, but are far more scattered.
---
Hobbyists who played the game 16 hours a day MORE than people currently who get payed to compete. Also, the wow competitive scene is essentially dead so the argument that they play for money is irrelevant. Even people not competing are extremely skilled and I would even say a 1500 player is better than grand marshals back in the day. The Overall skill level is better  because people have been playing the damn game for 15 years now! I seriously don‚Äôt understand how you don‚Äôt get this! Are you telling me you were a better player in classic then you are now?! It was a new game! Of course they were worse then then they are now, they had time to improve and learn!  Even if the average player is shitty now the average player in vanilla would be twice as worse!  People barely even had functioning computers back then. I think you‚Äôre really overestimating how difficult vanilla is, I‚Äôve played the private servers. It‚Äôs a major time investment but it‚Äôs not difficult.
---
Classic and Retail are not mutually exclusive. I've had an active sub since BC and still enjoy retail, but you bet your ass I'm jumping on Classic as soon as it drops. 
---
Quit trying to incite drama.
---
It says a lot about the type of person you are raiding with tbh. I really dont care what Tipsout did in a 5man party with friends. I dont judge him on that.
---
But I would absolutely not be fine being in a guild with a known ninjalooter.
---
why?
---
No. It's only a 15th anniversary collector's box. It has nothing to do with classic.
---
Praise the lord that you made it!
---
I was subbed in 04 and still dont have access. So there is that.
---
I wish people could just enjoy this amazing gift we will be receiving together on August 27 instead of being on each others throats..
---
Shroud played wow in vanilla....
---
You‚Äôre wrong on all counts. The massive influx of Nost players was because of the servers near perfect scripting which mirrored the real patch 1.12 to a degree never before seen. When Blizzard shut down the servers was also when people started to open their eyes to the possibility of a Classic WoW, on a scale that doesn‚Äôt even come close to WotLK.
---
Wow this is the most misinformed comment about classic wow I've ever seen.
---
The mobs outside WC are lower lvl than the ones inside, while both are elite
---
What a stupid video. You use your WoW character as "you" speaking, taking up the majority of the screen, as if your the fucking Paladin.
---
This video is Supporting Alexensual and shitting on The Classicast.
---
Go back to Private Servers, fucking pleb.
---
Screenshot was pre-Benediction :)
---
Wasn‚Äôt it once AQ was launched?
---
As I've already stated in one of my other comments, I haven't even signed up for the beta yet because I don't have enough time to provide some useful data for Blizzard. 
---
So: 
---
&gt; how ~~fucking pathetically jealous~~ *concerned about a smooth launch* some people are
---
So its cheating?
---
Yeah just the SW one was across the city lol. IF is definitely shorter but SW will always be home.
---
Hey, just wanted to clarify. I've been on the demo and beta CDN client in a sandbox and have personally tested the wall jumps in Warsong Gulch and they're completely functional. None of them are patched.
---
Considering that the amount of XP they gain is not something that comes from the game engine but from the database tables telling the game engine what to do, it's not something that even remotely likely to be off by even a single point. They have the database from 1.12 and they repeatedly stated that that part of the game is sacrosanct, that they don't touch it in order to not open up the pandora's box.
---
Beta is for testing and in a normal beta, this would absolutely be one of the core things to test for - does progression work as intended? However, this beta is special in so far as the database being preserved and taken directly from the backup they found. It's not new development and it is absolutely, definitively the way it's meant to be. The beta part of this beta is only and exclusively concerning the game engine part of the game. Are the graphics correct? Is spell-batching working as before? Stuff like that. But not "does a boss hit too hard?" (no it doesn't, Tipsout, you pulled the boss with broken armor and with your healer out of range) or "do these mobs give the correct amount of XP?" These things are definitively exactly as they were in vanilla which means they are exactly as they are supposed to be.
---
Except at launch there was no Dire Maul so people called Deadmines DM because that makes more sense.
---
They basically don't use the original vanilla client, but instead are using the modern - today's wow engine, they imported the old assets into it (old textures, 3d models, sounds). Because the engine is new, it's full 64bit, DirectX 12, supports modern OSes, modern CPUs and modern GPUs, is multi-threaded and in regards to graphics specifics, supports all the antialiasing methods as the live wow, including MSAA 8x, supports render scale, anisotropic filtering 16x, supports ambient occlusion/HBAO+, high resolution shadows, sunrays and, oddly enough, physics based grass (one that moves away as the player walks through it). Under the graphis options in Classic they have a button named "Classic", supposedly a preset to make the game look as close as possible to the original one (so it will disable all these ambient occlusion, sunrays and so on).
---
Like what???? We all are curious now....
---

I'm new here, after getting recently hyped watching Asmon's stream. It's a bit disheartening to see you and other commenters here just straight bashing Asmongold viewers but I get it.
---
I do agree however that I've seen a lot of people whining about not getting into beta and being childish about it. It sucks. 
---
We're all here because we love the game man. I just want to have a good time, see you in game :)
---
Nah I have a 60 day card I will apply for character creation on my main account. I‚Äôll unfortunately have to pay with credit card for my second account.
---
Excuse me, good sir, but... Enjoying games in 2019? I don't think so. Unless you are streaming your "experience" and "content" to 5-9 random viewers in a dilapidated Twitch channel, interspersed with making videos about "lore" or "drama" to grow your "brand", you are most definately NOT playing games correctly.
---
You realize there are more things to test than just class abilities right?
---
- He likely did more quests than anyone by the time he stopped
---
- Testing different zones and terrain
---
- Testing different talents. Obviously he had access to the most comprehensive talent tree testing to date
---
- Monster varaity and how all of their 
---
- Different items you get along the way
---
- Mage aoe grinding itself is something worth spending time on to test how the monsters interact with the mechanics.
---
I could go on and on, but this idea that people who speed level are not doing their job as a beta tester is just flat out wrong. Blizzard just wants you to play the damn game and report what you find.
---
You guys are fucked in the head
---
No. If you play on low enough quality you don't even have grass.
---
Probably not, because when someone is invisible and you can't see them, there's literally no data about that player getting sent to your client.
---
You have no idea who Athene is do you.

&gt;Before the release date was announced this sub was generally pretty upbeat and friendly, now when I read comments it's just people swimming in a pool of tears over some streamer or tacitly measuring their dick with ruler in relation to how much more og they are than someone else.    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; You guys suck.
---
If someone is stealth, they don‚Äôt register on your game until you catch them out
---
Lol, I'm not saying it's right, I'm telling you how it *was*.
---
Back in Vanilla, I *always* heard it called VC after DM launched. That's just what happened.
---
Very good question. At a guess no, because as far as I know you can only see grass movement with the modern graphics settings. And it would give you an advantage.
---
having to play on pve servers because you get too upset at world pvp ... pathetic
---
Was going to write something similar but I‚Äôll just upvote yours.
---
Who the fuck cares WHAT they have on THIER stream as long as they are having fun in the game and people enjoy watching them.
---
Via 9gag
---
No. You do hear a sound and you can actually see the person in stealth if you are lucky enough. You can not tab target though. You have to click the guy with the mouse as far as I remember.
---
Don't feed the trolls folks.
---
Also, I'd pay you $100 to fuck off and stop trolling /r/classicwow/ but I know you'd just give it to Blizzard for something stupid like a free max level character and a giant cartoon mount.
---
Debatable and if that's so then he was like 7. What does he remember.
---
Imagine getting baited by "World First Deadmines".
---
Oh is he taking a break from managing his pyramid scheme cult ?
---
A lot of the endgame mechanics are just different versions of low level mechanics. Mortal Strike on a mob at level 30 does not behave particularly different from Mortal Strike on a mob at level 60.
---
Same goes for a lot of the underlying systems of the game. You can test it at level 30 and having a cap there means people wont just be spending all their time leveling to 60 and then trying to raid while ignoring to report bugs as it slows them down.
---
Yeah, but how many people like you are there? It's fairly easy to keep playing the game when you get steady progress. But just playing the game to farm gold and maybe raid a bit every week might turn some people off, don't you think?
---
no summoning stones in vanilia and less flight paths. \*NO CHANGES\*
---
Its perfectly legal here in the us üòÇü§£üòâ
---
Well it's true, high level content is much harder on retail, but the problem is that that's the only hard thing, everyone else in the game is clearable by a mindless monkey
---
2004 account.... didn't get an invite. Its 100% Random imo.
---
Lol.
---
Maybe, but RFC (if we‚Äôre talking rage fire chasm) is easy even with the elites. Did you see the clip of some of these streamer guys getting destroyed in WC though? Hilarious.
---
Is verdan needed by any quests? From what I remember it used to be 1 attempt on him then leave.
---
But I also dont remember him being too difficult besides the high hits but I started playing late in vanilla.
---
LazyPig is not a vanilla addon, it was made for private servers.
---
Frankly you'd better go 31/20/0 if your main focus is PVP : piercing howl and enrage are way too good to pass for even more stun resist.
---
Back in Vanilla I was crushing most rogues (and I wasn't even an Orc). Only the very very good ones were killing me, and they were a rarity (I'd say less than 10 on the server both factions).
---
For warrior, rogue is your easiest fight (I'd say it's the only one ! ;-).
---
Now if you want to tank quite a lot and still be good enough at PVP you can go with a 31/5/15 (for defiance).
---
This is what the beta is for; if you're genuinely concerned that there's a difference, get some evidence and report it!

You‚Äôre not kidding. I‚Äôd be an awful entertainer....
---
This is what the beta is for.
---
I swear do people like you enjoy the downvotes?
---
Is your goal to be at zero karma?
---
Exactly. If you are being an asshole to someone it doesnt matter if all the progress will be reset at the end of the beta or not. You still made another player have an unpleasant experience that he did not need to have.
---
The little animation on grass, or ground clutter overall for that matter, happens only client-side. So no one besides yourself will see it move.
---
I'm not in the beta myself (yet!) but I'm pretty certain that this is how it works on retail and thus it should also be like that on Classic.
---
yeah, i like watching speed runs of retro console games, those generally don't have a lot of people watching except during GDQ but I get a ton of entertainment out of that. at the same time I see LoL matches with hundreds of thousands of people watching and i would get 0 entertainment from that. i'm not saying the higher the streamer count the more entertaining it is, it's just that generally more people find those streams entertaining hence the viewer count.
---
Haha nice one
---
Well good we are only in the beta if the experts find all Kind of things wrong which they remember 100% right from 12 years ago. 
---
A shame Blizzard doesn¬¥t have a running 1.12 Client on which they double check everything... /s
---
Cool, thanks!

The current live wow servers are currently hosted in Los Vegas and Chicago. As for where the Classic realm servers I haven't seen confirmation anywhere where they will be hosted. If it's in the same datacenters as live then cool , Los Vegas and Chicago. If it's the ones used for the other Classic games , US east and US west that's another thing entirely.
---
The classic beta will give us some clues in this area - we can run netstat commands to ascertain where its connecting to and from that infer which datacenter they are in. From that we can make an educated guess as to where the Classic servers will be once they go live.
---
It's not just resilience - it's arena balance requirements in general. If a lone DPS can kill a healer, they'll have no chance against 2. So healers in any expansion I've played are obnoxiously strong 1v1.
---
&gt; The game was difficult and more unforgiving than any retail player is ready for.
---
hahaha it is a good thing there is no r/classicwowcirclejerk because you guys are taking this to another level, lmao

Wrong. It has nothing to do with FPS. It's the wider FoV that gives off the vibe that you're running faster. Spoken like someone who's never played classic.
---
My anuss is readdy.
---
That's what I ment. It's a shame. I want one too
---
Ofcourse they are, since they're using the modern wow engine, it has the same settings as the live game.
---
I definitely remember the thunderfury spam and replacing words in movie names with murloc being very big in the aq and on stages of vanilla.
---
imgflip.com
---
Na, you got the mount and the epics from the quest line (also AQ was unlocked) but I don‚Äôt believe the title was a thing then.
---
"Are you serious? Is your idea of how things work? I need to provide evidence?"
---
Interesting. The level of fanboy you're exuding is even more than I thought. Blizzard is re releasing classic wow because they are hemorrhaging subs and people don't play anymore. If you think that a pserver is the reason why they're doing that I can't help you
---
Definition of Beta .... ? Report what you find that's what the beta is for
---
This is pretty cool.  
---
I don't know the lore at all but I thought all the qiraji stuff came from insects in the ground near the old gods being corrupted, not old god corruption leading to the creation of all insects on the planet.
---
RFC elites were always pretty weak.  And leveling is pretty quick until you get to around lvl 30+
---
Why the donwvotes? People here are fucking jealous lol
---
this what happens when streamer fanboys take over. now realize that if you roll in a realm that has a big streamer playing on it, its gonna be exactly like this, but 100x worse.
---
STREAMERS ARE CANCER.
---
Thunderfury, blessed toothpick of the Windseeker
---
Correct, the title was added with TBC.
---
That would be hilarious but imagine how strong Rogue/Mage would be...or how hard Arms warriors would hit.

you won't be chosen unless your sub is active

Unless you know something that I'm unaware of, he has said he's never played on any private servers.

---
He didn't play original classic aye?
---
Psst: vanilla is not as hard as it is in your head. Also, it's a beta. If values are off, that's what the beta is for. It's not a demo.
---
He cleared vc, you filthy casual.
---
Oh I gotcha. Yeah 100% agree.
---
Yeah
---
Like 15 years ago maybe when players had no idea what they were doing
---
hes a master of deadpan if he was joking. he actually thinks hes like gladiator level player.
---
My accounts from 2008, so I doubt.
---
No, the Grass moving is a client side effect.
---
I really didn't like Asmongold when I first started watching him until I realized nearly everything he says is kind of sarcastic and silly. He seems pretty proficient at the game while giving his (sometimes wrong or cringeworthy) opinions, but he somehow grows on you after a while.
---
also only taking them at their word that it won't be permanent, because their word is so great.  i love those class changes we were promised in 8.0, oh 8.1, i mean no more changes until 9.0 maybe.  
---
yep, because of world bosses it's guaranteed that layering will be removed because it makes much more sense to have 10k people crammed in to 1 world than to have 3 world boss spawns a week
---
I still vividly remember the rainstorms being like that, sandstorms in Tanaris as well...might even have some screenshots
---
Haha but you can‚Äôt deny a lot of the spells are much cooler now. It‚Äôs not a deal breaker for since I appreciate the grind more than anything. Would if just been a nice touch.
---
Ah ok, my misunderstanding then.
---
Ouch.
---
I'm lucky to be an early adopter of gmail. I assumed it would have some longevity.
---
Sometimes we just dont remember things as well as we think we do. I do not mean you imply you act as a know-it-all. I watch your stream and I greatly enjoy it.
---
But, example: The delayed damage on Seal of Righteousness that you pointed out on the stream. I suspect thats actually the Blizzlike behaviour.
---
There's video evidence suggesting its the case, such as this video where we at 60 seconds into the video can see the Paladin reckbomb a Priest with SoR active.
---
The priests healthbar goes down, then after a short delay drops again, presumably because the SoR damage lands after a small delay.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTf8gQhejfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTf8gQhejfE)
---
i did that not doing it again lol. grinding takes forever
---
Haha moron
---
Last time I played in bfa disc priest was almost unplayable without mouseover macros.....so no they aren't dead.
---
Oh. It's retarded. :(
---
Legion gets a pass though. Shit was good
---
Wow, people are actually testing?  Nice..
---
Jesus christ.... I won't lie I like his lore videos talking about how good quests are... but this guy needs to be out of the beta.  Honestly.  That or just tell him to stop reporting because it's very clear he is going to send more false reports than real ones lol.
---
No need to get personal. They‚Äôre bleeding subs because they‚Äôve released incredibly shitty expansions, for which you are right. I‚Äôm just saying that without Nost people wouldn‚Äôt have been rallying Classic servers. Maybe a reason for the sub hemorrhage is because there were vanilla pservers like Nost.
---
Do you know if a rogue can open max lvl chests at lvl 35 ?
---
I remember back in Vanilla it was always a hassle to get a chest unlocked, so I was thinking of making an alt rogue just for this.
---
How is it a big head scratcher? There was interest for legacy since TBC launch and there have been private servers before and after Nost, however Nost really did make an impact. It made everyone remember vanilla. Nost made a 280k signed petition for vanilla made by Blizz and had a lot of influential people talk about it.
---
It made Blizz react and is one of the very rare private servers that got enough attention for Blizz to shut it down. Later they even got invited to Blizz HQ.
---
Would we get vanilla regardless of Nost? Maybe, but they did cause a huge impact.
---
Also private servers do reflect vanilla wow experience. They are not perfect, but have been getting better over the years and guess what classic will not be a perfect vanilla copy either with custom changes, layering etc.
---
same, wonder if it needs to be a continuous sub since then
---
so stuff is different from what you remember? 1. its a beta so some thing might be wrong 2. if youre comparing it to how hard it is on private servers, those were likely wrong 3. maybe your memory is just wrong. or maybe its actually fucked up in the beta and needs to be fixed, but seeing how blizzard has a funtioning 1.12 client to base things off of, its probably accurate
---
What was so bad about it? I stopped playing in June 2009 (sometime in the middle of wotlk) For me it seemed like cataclysm ruined most of what I loved so much
---
1) he charged right through my trap and it‚Äôs a known bug.
---
2) was gonna juke him off on stream off the deck
---
This is thing happened.  I witnessed it.
---
I'm on PC and still can't read it.
---
The way I see it, the original classic servers were tuned for a population of about 3k players.
---
Layering is a solution created in order to use the exact same spawn rates, with each layer being the equivalent of an old realm (3k players).
---
To me, layering sounds like a technically elegant solution if we are interested in keeping everything as authentic as possible, while at the same time handling load issues that will occur in the beginning.
---
Most other solutions would probably need significantly more development, increasing the differences between the original classic wow. (Spinning up a new instance of the entire server dynamically is easier than tweaking all the spawn mechanics in the entire game based on criteria like current realm population and current zone population).
---
The "True Classic" solution would be to just limit each realm to 3k players, but I am willing to accept "Sub Realms" in order to futureproof for a lower stable number of players some time after launch. (They did warn us that they did not want to re create the launch experience of classic)
---
Once they are revealed (the sound gets played) you can definitely tab target, you need to be facing them though
---
Same here, I will very much enjoy the leveling process but I also want to be efficient and maximize my 20 hours a week.
---
Every company has to be financially viable to survive. They must bring in more money than the spend. There are lots of different ways this can manifest, and since we are not the CFO or in the accounting department at Blizzard we can only speculate as to what that threshold is. Furthermore, companies are not obligated to stop when they get to this threshold; if they can make more money then they probably will. And there is nothing wrong with that. 
---
Accusing an entertainment company of being "greedy" is just a poor work around trying to explain why you shouldn't have to pay for some service or product they offer. It really just exposes the accusers greed that they should have something for free.
---
Nah, something terrible will go wrong and he'll end up awaking 500 years later.  Just like Cartman.
---
If you don't use cheetah the mob will run faster than you and hit you though.
---
You absolutely need cheetah to kite Drakkistah for example.
---
You're mixing two different types of RP
---
Wouldnt casting rank 1 rejuv make shamans go oom?
---
How so?
---
Yeah I was subbed for 80% of Legion, had a lot of fun with the weapons.
---
I want to like retail WoW but it's just in such a sorry state right now.
---
I don't think that pservers are a bad thing, I have played on once. I just think your post is a blanket statement thanking Nostalrius for Blizzard actually making classic. The most important part is that we have it, not how we got there. I also don't mean to argue with you either that's just my opinion on it
---
He streamed during legion. He‚Äôs been back.
---
Im just curious how he got legacy title "Scout" and "Senior Sergeant" showing up on his achievements on wow armory if he did not play back then.
---
Perfect size for a gnome rogue!
---
I know they're so overpowered!!!
---
Hi, /u/Rayluxx
---
It was announced alongside Classic.
---
I mean, I know its not specifically Classic but it is Classic inspired. (I do wish all of the items in it  contained pure Classic, no other maps, ect)
---
Ya no kidding what's with all this world first talk.
---
No, it was elites in both cases.
---
it's a classic! but as u/Adunaiii asked; wasn't this video made for earlier patches during Vanilla, and some of the problems that were addressed got "fixed" later?
---
Regardless: funny as hell
---
give this guy a key
---
That's the conclusion I drew :'(
---
[this is me feeling sad about it, at this exact moment](https://imgur.com/a/V3CcCcf)
---
Hi, /u/dwellerofthemines
---
Two days into the beta you big baby. Calm down
---
there was a model change thing in classic where u could change the stealth to a Red Arrow effect , saw it back in 2005 on a vid but dunno if its legit or not
---
I feel you - they weren¬¥t able to achieve such nice graphics back then. 
---
It would have been too much for the Server with the big spells flying everywhere in a condensed 40 man raid :/
---
And since most are #nochanges I don¬¥t even think the new spell graphics were up to debate sadly.
---
But most classic ones are just fine :)
---
Streamers are phags
---
there are no 22 lvl mobs outffront WC...
---
not really, the reason this exists is because people have been asking them to do it for a long ass time and they never have, and then when nostalrius came around they saw there was a real demand for it, and that people were pushing really hard to get them to cave in and make it. if they were being greedy about it, itd require a separate sub or something like that
---
Leveling fast? StaysafeTV played for almost 37h straight and got to 27. Keep in mind that he basically got all the mobs for himself since the amount of people he has to compete with are extremely minimal. The leveling is not "too fast", you're just watching people no-life leveling.
---
Since when were elites hard in RFC?
---
Wrong aggro on healing aswell as warrior aggro? I have watched groups run BfD, RFC, WC, DM and SFK.. and the aggro seems just fine. But if there's a problem then it's a bug that will get reported and fixed since this is a BETA where people test the current "in-development" state of the game.
---
Sorry, Imgur doesn't seem to work well on mobile :(
---
That Hunter was doodoo, and guzu outplayed himself
---
Oh... that explains ‚ÄúGloves of Vigorous Masturbation‚Äù that I saw linked with lots of haste on it (though this was in TBC)
---
That's great news! I can live with the thought that Blizzard hates me and will never send me an invite, than knowing that the beta is sub-locked.
---
its 3k pop per continent, and given the number of people in instances at any given time that probably allows for a total pop of around 6.5-7k before layers even come into play.  do you think the max pop will be much higher?
---
lets say they made it 10k.  at launch and for the first few days/weeks there'll be servers where layers come into play.  people can level with a bit less competition for mobs etc
---
as time goes by, the pop reduces.  if the stable pop at peak times was 6k, we're laughing.  if its like 6-7k that sucks for people in layer 2.  if it's 8k+ i think layers will be fine
---
my main concern is with economy because players in 2nd layer would have access to spawns but i have to assume they've considered this
---
You've devolved into conspiracy speculation. Why would anyone bother listening to you?
---
You might as well not take them at their word that layering will be in at all, and that we'll simply have queue times instead. After all, if you've completely abandoned any shred of trust in what the creators of a product explicitly promise is the case in televised interviews, why not just make things up entirely? Maybe Death Knights will be in the game. And they'll have transmogs, too! Who knows: It's not like you can trust the insidious Blizzard devs or anything. You certainly can't take the word of the lead designer who was not only a Vanilla player but a very high profile raid GM within Vanilla and has a clear personal incentive to make Classic as great as he can. Might as well just make shit up from whole cloth. Classic will have a doubled subscription fee! All six phases will last three months before they move on to BC! They'll only have one mega server with 85 layers! The R14 grind will be nerfed for casuals and take approximately four Alterac Valley wins to complete!
---
Yes, with the lvl 30 cap thats likely.
---
Dead Mines
---
Blizzard is reacting because they are losing money and the share holders are rattled. BFA is a disaster. (I still play because I'm a big dumb idiot)
---
I've got my girlfriend ready build her a pc and told her that she's playing along with me
---
Very poor estimate. The private server population has well over 150k players.
---
Benediction was added in 1.4.0. Zul'Gurub was added in 1.7.0.
---
Yeah I saw you wrote that to the other comment :3¬¥
---
I don¬¥t know either then :D But the "different Mobs different XP" answer seems reasonable at least...
---
GL HF
---
Thanks for sharing this blizzlike informations so they can return it to the way it was
---
Yes I want to both RP and PvP. No I can't do this on a regular PvP realm without getting shat on. C'mon Blizz, this should be an easy call to make!
---
Man I wish someone else would buy a 3d printer I could use
---
&gt;  the "surprise" will be so brief, and these expert min-maxers adjust so quickly,
---
I totally agree. We're talking about people that no-life grind on private. servers. and go for world first on them, planning everything even all the classes their members will play.
---
People putting that much time and effort into it will blast the content. I would say easily, but if that much effort is put forth I wouldnt call it easy.
---
I probably wouldn't have played it if I hadn't seen it on stream. I had though about it but I decided there would be to much pain of missing certain modern amenities. But seeing all the streamers back in the world I fell in love with doing quests I hadn't seen or done in years made me super hyped.
---
This is doubly true for the beta. The low level areas are just *swamped* with people, so it's a pain in the ass to get quest mobs unless you're in a party. I ran around the Fargodeep mine (south of Goldshire) for about an hour trying to get the melted candles and gold dust for quests.
---
I assume the same will be true at launch as well.
---
Well that'll teach him to pick Feline Swiftness next time...
---
wow is still the best mmo just by default because theres almost no other mmo's out there that are good. just because its the most popular right now doesnt mean its good. modern wow is a shell of what it used to be.
---
The "you don't want that, it's so long ago and only your nostalgia is speaking"-argument was proven wrong on a massive scale. You are just ignorant tbh.
---
Looks like the rain got him directly in the eye from the look of his face.
---
* Leveling is fast, well the first to hit lvl 30 on the beta did it in 1d5h, the half leveling point to 60 is supposed to be lvl 44 and it's assumed that once classic release there will be sub 4d runs to 60 so no, the leveling isn't too fast.
---
* It's RFC, what did you expect? 75% of player don't have more than 2 greens when they start this dungeon, it was never meant to be hard, it's there to help new player understand role such as tank, healer and dps.
---
* Do you have proof to back up your affirmation? 
---
* Same
---
This is one thing I am really waiting for: Levelling fishing and cooking again... seems I am a Crendor at heart.
---
Not only have I been subbed since 04, I've never canceled my sub for even a month, no invite.
---
Not that I'd use it, I'm saving the experience for launch
---
2 gold is a really good boost at low levels...  
---
Around lvl 20 skills start costing 50+silver, so you can safely get what ever skills you need and test them in your play style...
---
Or you could buy up some low crafting matts and get ahead on your crafting.  Normally you cant farm enough to craft gear at your own level, ie you are lvl 20 but only able to craft lvl 10 gear AND to craft the lvl 20 gear you need items from level 25 mobs/zones.  So 2 Gold could help you craft a few good items
---
Or if you are really AH savvy, it could help you start buying and flipping items on the AH.
---
I personally would buy up skills I might not need, as many guides recommend only getting "X and Y but never Z past rank 1".  Most of the them, the reason is that you can "save money for your mount and buy that skill later".  I suspect some of those skills might work different than Pserver and be useful.
---
July 2005 here, none yet. EU!
---
Yes thank you!
---
Never ever ret or prot pally.  Or feral druid (dps)
---
And then there's me, hoping Markymark gets an invite
---
Fury yes / arms less so
---
We are three currently, with some other guys who used to play WoW but don't want to come back to Classic.  
---
As you can imagine, this calendar didn't help to impress our female colleagues, but hey, all we need is Classic.
---
You are not ~~prepared~~employed!
---
I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre back.
---
...not sure if you‚Äôve seen the latest cinematic
---
Shrug, people enjoy games for different reasons. If people want to be first to get X in vanilla and that's fun for them, why shouldn't they?
---
Yeah...
---
Why?
---
That would almost definitely not happen. Naxx gear is already so absurdly powerful that it basically makes you a demi-god. I couldnt imagine them introducing more progression. Maybe like hard mode raids, where health in MC is increased like 1000% and damage 300% or something
---
People that speedrun will not engage in PVP so he still will be left alone.
---
Not all of it but a significant amount.
---
Yet people playing Tauren report being able to swing through pillars in Arena for all of TBC.
---
Maybe you grew out of MMOs?
---
they don't want what happened to runescape
---
Phonetically that would be fuckongrats if both.

I mean he wrote BFD not wc. I know reading is hard and whatever, and looking at the vod that shows level 22 mobs outside the dungeon
---
I just remember for alliance questing you do the following to hit 60 in about 7 days Elwynn &gt; Westfall &gt; Redridge &gt; Duskwood &gt; First half of STV to 35 &gt; Arathi Highlands &gt; Hinterlands &gt; Searing Gorge &gt; Burning Steppes &gt; Western Plaguelands &gt; Eastern Plaguelands and DING 60 no quest helping needed.
---
It‚Äôs my understanding that warriors were some of the very best melee dps after a tier or two of raiding gear but struggled before that point. Someone with more experience would know better though.
---
Why do people continue to throw money at other people who don't need it lol
---
He is great. We should start a petition to get him a job at Blizzard. I think he would be great on their team. That is of course if he even would want to work for them.
---
Nope too. Just "cleaned up" my account and waiting for launch.... 
---
AND THE BETA INVITE, I WOULD GIVE MY FIRST BORN FOR!
---
People are always trying to find patterns in randomness. Sometimes random is just random...
---
Cata was one thing, but WoD... everything basically as ruined/more ruined compared to cata, except even less stuff to do
---
You don't have to be a fanboy to realize the healer wasnt paying attention in that clip. There were many issues with the fight
---
That‚Äôs a sea splitter. Lots of people are going to be happy and lots of people going to be mad.
---
he's strafing there, the problem is the hunter shoot animation from modern wow is making that happen
---
I wonder will there be a server with that name
---
It‚Äôs sarcasm people. Instead of titling it ‚ÄúFirst Deadlines run on new Classic Beta‚Äù
---
Relax, they don‚Äôt actually think they‚Äôre  the first players to run a 15 year old dungeon.
---
You disgrace yourself.
---
You honestly aren't even making sense any more.
---
You're practically just replying "no u" but in nonsense sentences.
---
Just stop, I feel embarrassed on your behalf at this point.
---
Understood, I like to think that Nost has had an influence on Blizzards decision-making from going from the famous ‚Äúyou think you want it‚Äù to ‚ÄúClassic will be released 8/28‚Äù:)
---
It's been 13-14 years. You may just not remember it as well as you think you do.
---
Huh? Most streamers stream the 8hrs per day, that you would normally work. They can have time for girlfriends, friends and go out just like other people.
---
They look at older accounts, i think most accounts from 2004 got in now and slowly 2005 accounts gets in. Sadly im 2007 so i won't get in ;(( Not soon atleast
---
layering literally has nothing to do with streamers, youre delusional if you think thats what its for. and it makes sense to invite large figures in the community to the beta, look at all of the bugs that have been found just from having hundreds of people watching someone ELSE play. if they were to allow that same amount of people into the beta all at once, or even at all, itd be a shit show. also they said its a CLOSED small scale beta currently.
---
My 2007 account got hacked which made me quit until I created a new account in late draenor, life isn't fair for most it seems.
---
Yea, the world first titles are a bit annoying. Biggest thing is they put it in like they are competing with more than 1k other lucky peeps who got into the beta? Come on, let's see that world first title at launch. They should change it to "Streamer first" because really that is what most the beta seems to be currently.
---
They said you join the layer with people you group with
---
RP-PVP is the only server type I've never tried, but when I really think about it, it might be the server type I would most enjoy this time around.
---
This is gold. Thank you.
---
Lmao another idiot that can‚Äôt differentiate between bitter and sweet. Some people are different than you and enjoy laughing at things. It‚Äôs not some sort of socially awkward laugh to not let the dragon out. Don‚Äôt project the way you would perceive something into someone else‚Äôs words. Just read the words. Having to read your response and seeing your utter failure at general reading comprehension is much more of a trigger than tips out failing.
---
Human/Orc Fury war is #1 dps in classic. Arms is fine horde side with BRE. Tank throughout leveling and more, you'll be able to dictate the rules of the runs, even get paid if you feel like it. A tank is the most precious commodity.
---
Kind of, they are  extremely good at running away, but also can die in singe stun if not in bear form (and then they cant move or heal). Geared paladins are the unkillable ones.
---
My free month expired on 11/30/2004. Does that make sense? I can't remember if I played in the beta or not and if that counted.
---
Are they though?
---
Druid became my PvP main in TBC but I had a lot of experience playing with it in vanilla.
---
Druids were nowhere near as good in vanilla as in TBC. There's a few reasons for this:
---
1. Huge mana cost for shape shifting. You need to really budget your shapeshifts for breaking slows. You can't just shapeshift out of almost infinite slows like you could in TBC.
---
2. Lack of mp5. This goes with the shapeshifting issue. You just didn't regen as much mana to allow you to utilize a druid to its fullest.
---
3. Lack of lifebloom. Lifebloom was just OP. It MADE the resto druid and was more important than cyclone. Without lifebloom, druids couldn't heal "passively". The little HoT you do have just gets dispelled. Life bloom protected your HoTs.
---
4. Lack of cyclone. Cyclone was the cc of cc's. It was ridiculously strong.
---
5. No resilience. With resilience and sitting in your bear form, you could tank two rogues wailing on you and yawn. In world PvP, I used to dive out of the sky into groups of enemies, dance in the middle of their group, and hope they can attack me while I heal through their dps while going in and out of bear form. You cannot do that in vanilla, EVERYONE can be bursted down almost instantly.
---
All this combined means the druid is about average for most things. The only thing they excel at is carrying flags in WSG and maybe defending in AB. For healing, I'd much rather be a paladin or priest because of how important dispel is.
---
I was subbed from day 1 of Vanilla all the way until TBC hit. No beta for me.
---
Random is random.
---
Hell yes. More vanilla 5 and 10 mans pls
---
Agreed, what would the Original Poster say if bfa got far more attention on 8.2 release day
---
Love tips, hes a good guy afaik.
---
Still, literaly quoting here: "i did WC thausands of times" and he gets lost. Twice. It really does make him look bad :(
---
p3 is bg's
---
Sausage and eggs for the girls
---
Cosmos was the first addon I ever tried.  I remember asking if I would get banned for using it.
---
i resubbed my feb 2006 account 2 days ago, nothing yet.
---
I played a rogue throughout vanilla and to be honest, you destroy the warriors in DPS until they pick up some of the BWL and AQ40 pieces. 
---
After that they do tend to beat you but not by enough for your raid leader to replace all the rogues. People exaggerate the difference quite a bit in my opinion. 
---
It is however very sad to be topping the charts until the boss hits 20% and then your lead vanishes within 30 seconds lol. 
---
And like others here have said, consider outside of raiding - you're going to be spending a lot of time gearing up for MC, helping guildies, world PVP,  and farming materials. And you will be MISERABLE during that time as a fury warrior until pretty far into the content schedule. If you really want to melee dps throughout all of classic I'd recommend a rogue.
---
Programmers play Horde ;)
---
Its a rare. Not an elite rare. Numbers look fine.
---
[fixed this one for you bud](https://imgur.com/a/W93teun)
---
For those wondering. I got in. 2004 account. I was talking with a few folks in game and they had similar account dates.
---
I also heard some newer accounts got in tho but I think majority were old players.
---
As someone who played on an RPPvP from classic til WoD (Twisting Nether US) and also had alts in the big RPPVE servers, it's roughly the same amount. The only difference is the population size.
---
Those big events are awesome, (and we had some on TN) but 95% of RP happens on a small scale in private channels.
---
It's correct.  
---
Elites in the world = 2*XP  
---
Elites in dungeons = 2.5*XP
---
February 11th 2005, OG Collector's Edition. But seriously fuck subbing just to get beta access. I haven't played retail since BfA launch and I refuse to give them my money for that trash.
---
I want to see that Alliance guide get done lol
---
Walk with the earthmother
---
I see fear ward as far more useful on healers and dps. If a tank gets feared, get a new tank.
---
You said it yourself, man. Throwing an invite isn't difficult at all, what are you talking about? The method you do it in doesn't matter, you might as well have 4-5 buttons on your action bars that let you click on each and join that layer. Doesn't matter how user friendly or tedious it is to accomplish, it will be exploited. Your understanding is as good as mine, it's just the exploitation part I feel you underestimate.
---
Yes they can if they have levelled lock picking all the way up though. Is hard from 35 Cos the best places to level after that are higher levels.
---
Yeah spirit is not a good stat for healy shaman, as they have ZERO passive mana regen.  Even mana tide doesn't scale off of spirit at all either just gives a flat mana/5 boost.
---
Nah. In fact, rogues are basically at their worst in 1.12(.1). Which is not to say remotely bad, but they were far stronger when World of Roguecraft was made. It's funny, but it's not relevant.
---
New raids and gear? So pretty much an expansion?
---
Yeah on private servers skipping redridge is a good idea. For classic, probably not. The quests rewards are pretty good and quests aren't bad either
---
&gt; You're practically just replying "no u" but in nonsense sentences.
---
I'm sorry but if you're expecting serious replies, maybe your argument should boil down to more than "your statement can't unreasonably be interpreted in this way that makes it false and if we take it at face value then it's not true still but I don't want to name a video where it doesn't happen"
---
Wow! So thrilled to see so many people in the same boat as me! Gives me real hope :)
---
If you are organizing a guild for guys like us, can you respond to this message here? I have an RL buddy who used to raid back in the day too and we are looking to get in with a good group Day 1
---
I thought AV and WSG are phase 2. Can‚Äôt see that being 6mths.
---
no not at all, i just dont like the direction that blizzard has gone with wow in the last 8 years or so because they destroyed alot of the core values the game used to have. and no other mmo grabs my attention like wow did, especially with classic on the horizon. if i grew out of mmo's i woudnt be excited for classic
---
This was posted yesterday...
---
Seems pretty clear to me. Only one version of the game per account can be logged in at a time. Based on Classic being available to everyone with a retail subscription, it seems they're tying it to the retail account. I'm guessing they'll have some sort of toggle on the character select screen? I'm not sure how that's going to be implemented. Maybe they'll have a separate client in the drop down list like PTR/ other WoW Accounts. And when you log in to either, it gives you the "You've been logged in somewhere else message." It is kind of inconvenient if I wanted to be logged in on retail, but it makes sense in a way. I can't be in two places at once.
---
fury is best dps in vanilla, arms can be ok if horde with windfury totem.
---
No? It means Tauren also have a higher max range on their shots.
---
Yeah I typed the wrong one, glad to know you never made a mistake before ... and yeah the lvl make since if its bfd...  but as I was watching I couldn't find the two times he was pointing too.
---
Maybe the difficulty comes from walking the right place so you don't have to walk for an hour?
---
Nope. Pure random. Guy with 11-23-04 and a sub and still not in.
---
Not necessarily how twitch works though. Some of the biggest streamers, think about like Sodapoppin, etc. have talked about how much money they make and the fact that they are millionaires and Soda still makes 20k-50k+ on sellout Sunday‚Äôs.
---
Thanks for giving asmon 5 gold!
---
Any advice for speed leveling and being the first.
---
True story.
---
it's a conspiracy to put 2 and 2 together and question somebody who says that equals 3?
---
the devs are the ones promising that layering is the solution, it will allow many more times players at the same time to fix the queue problem, and then they are guaranteeing that most of those players quit by the end of phase 1 and it will make sense to remove layers.  that it's not possible for layers to exist after phase 1 because world boss integrity is too damn important for some reason compared to black lotus or rarespawn or the integrity of everything else that might be affected by layers.
---
none of that makes any sense, and it's coming from people with a record of convincing people of things that don't make sense and surprising them every time
---
Leave the little Sm√©agol creature alone to covet its precious BFA.
---
This is the same type of person who would talk crap about a new, higher quality pserver that was coming out. Soon, and everyone they knew would flock to. They‚Äôre afraid because it‚Äôs better.
---
Also, these types of people are the ones who‚Äôve invested a lot of time and energy into modern WoW, and can‚Äôt even think about giving it up.
---

---
Everyone say it with me:
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I accidentally ended up on the same server as a major PvP streamer but on the wrong faction... that shit was a nightmare. The pop was split practically 80/20
---
Thanks. I don't mind dying a dozen times to reach the place to train lock-picking.
---
But I don't want to have to lvl a rogue to 60 just to open chests :D
---
Literally 70% of classes destroy warriors in pvp on 60
---
Pretty sure this is not true. I think it is 6.25% back in the day - but that is based on memory. Would need blizz to confirm
---
Early vanilla you lost em if you deselected your target.
---
Fury is great dps. Arms isn‚Äôt really viable in raids but it‚Äôs fine if you want to DPS dungeons.
---
thinking the same. I was a big Quin69 Fan in D3 Season 1- 4.  
---
It ended after he was sh\*t talking and spitting on the classic community.  
---
He doesn't deserve to be in beta. Same with Towelliee.   
---
Never forgetti  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BB86\_kgUbM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BB86_kgUbM)
---
I know lots of people have already commented with numbers but some of the bigger streamers get even bigger cuts than people are mentioning. Like I know summit gets at least $4 per sub but they might have upped it to $4.50.
---
Yeah saw that later, to my defense I couldn't sleep and it was 4 am. I do think arms has more to offer but like end of the day you're gonna do hybrid spec and it's gonna be shit either way unless you have a friend with a healing class
---
ty for telling me
---
Good point, will probably get fixed soon!
---
Incorrect for partnered streamers.
---
ah ok :) I will probably try as an ALT :p
---
Undead have wotf, and cannibalize which could help with mana conservation. 
---
Plus lore wise, its kinda cool to imagine some human preacher in stratholme who got infected and died. Woke up as an undead and abandoned by his birth culture. Taken in by orcs and tauren. And he's like, whelp, priesty stuff is what I know and I'll move on the best I can with what I got. I may look like a monster, but I'll still heal your wounds. For the Horde!
---
Not really, it's more the other way around really
---
 What method of aoe levelling did you do (coc or blizzard) and what spots did you farm? 
---
Did you noticed any differences in your aoe farming itself compared to private servers?
---
this is the first thing i thought of when we saw that mouseover macros worked in the blizzcon demo and i was worried blizzard didnt catch it. hopefully they fix it before launch otherwise rogues get a MASSIVE buff from it.
---
Well generally if the tank gets chaos controlled by the boss/mob goes and hits the next person on threat who isnt under a chaos control either so by all means it's just very useful to keep it on the tank and prevent an unfortunate wipe. But it still isnt and end all be all like people make it out to be, you only really need one dwarf priest in a raid if you're really going for it or if you're short but still want to be safe on fear immunity you can just have the 2nd highest dps get ready to stance dance around. 
---
tl;dr Overall racials in the game is just for flavor is my point
---
Explain to me how he's a fraud now.
---
You also only go to the movies when it's a tiny budget indie production?
---
Woohoo addons!
---
Hope they get GSE working
---
Not really, but makes for a good classic hate meme.
---
They saw a market from the demand, and because they are greedy and likes money, they will take advantage of the market to make money. The subscription needed to get beta is there because they know how to take advantage of the market without losing it.
---
Giving beta to big streamers is also a way to make more people hyped for the game, and hype is money.
---
It is only one sub because then the games won't drain each other. And could make people from BFA play classic and wise verse without extra cost on the players, because for blizzard it doesn't matter what you play, as long as you're hooked and giving them money.
---
You know most people don't give a shit about their karma yea?
---
When I leveled my warrior rogue in retail I never carried food (other than what I looted, which I would sell when i got to a vendor), I relied 100% on bandages for sustain.
---
boost to 110, isnt the max level 120?
---
And the queries into the whereabouts of Mankrik's wife.
---
A general wow sub filled with posts concerning a recent news and content about wow = dead game.
---
That's some solid logic.
---
My account is from 2005, but I read you had to be a subscriber to get into beta.  So I resubbed.  But I didn't win the beta lottery
---
Pog - Play of the Game - Something to be excited about. It's gone through the Twitch subculture grinder at this point but that's the original meaning.
---
I have yet to see one person do the poison wuest ffs. 
---
Ambush/Garrote&gt;Rupture&gt;Evis&gt;Ambush
---
I just found out about classic earlier this week. I haven't played since WotLK. I have already told 2 other friends and we are all going to be playing on release. So more exposure got them 3 subs at least. The last I had heard about WoW Classic before that was the whole "You think you do but you don't" thing, so i assumed it would never happen. There are probably tons more people like me who aren't plugged in to gaming news who need to be reached somehow.
---
Yeah, there was something like this. Also he was probably the most toxic LoL streamer and - kind of - cheater regarding his 1v1 with Alex Ich. Like this guy should really disappear once and for all from gaming "industry".
---
I disagree. I agree to the sentiment of hardcore players should receive things that make that stand out. But I believe that's already in place with the top raid drops and such. I believe there shouldn't be something available for a limited amount of time.
---
Maybe there will come new younger players that wasn't ready to play for whatever at launch that are just as capable of speedrunning, but since they mised the launch, they don't get the mount.
---
Having the unarmored mounts for a limited time doesn't make the "hardcore players" stand out. It makes the hardcore-while also lucky enough to experience the game early enough to know about all this shit so they could plan for it-players stand out.
---
Eh... Isn't it more like the audience Blizzard created with the dumbing down (or "increasing accessibility") over the years?
---
You seem a little easily influenced. It's a beta. Wait.
---
**2. Be Civil and Respectful**
---
HE WAS 100% hp, he charged in, 1st hit took out 40$ of his hp, second killed him. He ran out of healers range (with charge). Look at the video again pls.
---
BfA is so... not for me... that I miss WoD.
---
The subscriptions betray you, because they belong TO ME!
---
The movies aren't a voluntary tipping based model.
---
If they were I'd almost certainly give a tip to the indie before the blockbuster.
---
Athene... lmao
---
&gt;How did he get popular?
---
Blizzard gives him access to inside information that people want, and he goes all over the internet and lets everyone know. People starved for info will gravitate toward whatever sources they can find.
---
It‚Äôs not NOW it‚Äôs he has always been. He has always given the impression he is a knowledgeable veteran and makes videos for the world to see when he himself isn‚Äôt knowledgeable in the slightest. He isn‚Äôt suddenly a fraud, he always has been a fraud.
---
Not on reddit. We can't have everything though.
---
Just out of curiosity whats his 1-12 plan?  Because normally when I finish my starting area im level 10 MAYBE level 11.  Does he do all the starting areas he can?
---
Simply choose to correct gateway? Or did I miss somethin?
---
Best way to test NPC DPS values is the Elite Ogres over in Loch Moran.
---
Back in Vanilla Hunter could easily solo ONE, Warlock was next but needed Fear and both classes pets would die at end. Paladin normally needed Lay Of Hands to finish a fight but no other class could solo those. 
---
That was one of the earliest Elite Quests I remember that you got a decent stat ring for. So if all classes can solo those then it‚Äôs definitely some values that are off.
---
Blizzard shut down nost,people mad,mark kern and the nost team make petition,get 250k+ signs,Blizzard invites them to their headquarters. "PSERVERS DIDNT DO SHIT"....I didn't even play nost but because of nost it opened my eyes for vanilla.
---
I love this.
---
Also it is good to have some people that don't know everything about classic as testers, as they will ensure the sample isn't skewed. Because to be honest eventhough many here might have played back in 2004-2006 there is no way in hell we remember all the things in the game. Testers from privateservers contribute with helpful things cause they will compare the versions. But people claiming them to be the only ones fit for testing is wrong because then we are not getting the close to "authentic" experience as they will/might be so convinced that everything in classic is wrong and pservers are correct.
---
We all remember fragments of the game and a lot has been overridden if you have played on a pserver for to long
---
Do it!
---
the other reason they require a sub to play the beta might be because they could be trying to test the system that links the two subs together to make sure it works
---
Isn‚Äôt that what I said? Lol
---
I have never used discord. Is that like Ventrillo/Teamspeak lol?
---
I have been playing Path of Exile the last 4 years solo, and havent had the need for any sort of communication with other players in a game since like 2010 when I left WoW.
---
But yes, very interested in syncing up. I have a RL buddy in the same boat looking to join a guild like this with me
---
Have you seen what it takes to get R14? I don't want to discourage you, but many people seem to think you can just be a solid player pvping for 2-3 hours a day casually and reach R14. In reality you need to be in a premade group 4+ hours a weekday and 8+ on weekends to even get close.
---
I'll probably play it. Cause why not? I'm not one of the 5% Hardcore fans that even watch Blizzcon so if it wasn't for Reddit I'd have had no idea about the drama around it .
---
Absolutely unplayable!
---
Nost wasn't even anything special.
---
ScriptCraft
---
MangOS
---
Feenix WoW / Warsong + Emerald Dream
---
You should be thanking the above.
---
&gt; Is it possible to use 'front shredding'?
---
Not really, but there is some weird interaction where you can be "back to back" with the target and backstab/shred or w/e. You can't strafe in and out of the target to get backstabs, that won't work.
---
I'll get back to you on the shifting question, haven't leveled druid up yet.
---
So to test the system, and make money. Makes it a lot easier.
---
Do you have a video of the world first Imp summoning? I'd like to see what name it got.
---
Question: Will you use in-game map or physical map to consult when the game launches?
---
I‚Äôve watched all of Frost‚Äôs videos and he needs to be in to test out professions alone. No one knows more about professions than Frost does.
---
Because it wasn't true, there isn't as much salt as the circlejerk against /r/wow here.
---
Back in vanilla people who did it 100 times would still get lost. Some people are just spatially stupid and dont remember paths. 
---
Getting lost in WC is legit #nochanges
---
perplexity doing god's work!
---
earlier launch wouldn't be better for me, and the thousands of other adults for which time of the year doesn't really matter.
---
There's a ton of hype around it now and the first 6 months may be worth the cost required to make it happen but as a corporation I would sount the longevity of it.
---
You can play safe all you want,  you can't control if a mob runs away and pulls 4 more and you have to run away from them, and then you notice the only path you have to run away also has mobs ready to kill you.
---
Yeah you can play smart, but sometimes you just can't control what happens.
---
Lol k
---
Now sand and paint it :o
---
I felt the same way, but he quickly became one of my favorite streamers.
---
you hardly had to drink until around 8 to 10 and only if you didnt want to wait a short time.
---
I'd probably agree if I didn't specifically test it and I knew they were using the old client/networking/server versions.
---
But they aren't. If these were the hit box differences in vanilla it would have had a large impact on whether people picked a tauren or not. But it didn't, because the increased hitbox size was almost negligible.
---
So you basically missed Mists and Legion, the two ones that people say are supposed to be pretty good.
---
Or when you planned ahead and labelled your BASIC lines increasing in 10‚Äôs, but now you have to insert 11 lines of code...
---
kekkers
---
Nice one OP, A+ for effort!
---
Like what? I don‚Äôt understand. Retail is still so much fun and the difficulty has never been higher...
---
Yeah my account is November 2004 with a sub for most of every expan and no invite yet
---
Dunno, problem is Pserver memories get mixed with my old memories. :D
---
These things were pretty delicious. 
---
Goona try to stick to low sugar coffee this time around though.
---
Only took messing around In the tarting area to know I want this type of wow and not retail
---
Because people love to give more attention to the trolls than the majority that either don't care or is mildly interested in it.
---
These type of comment are mostly made by a very vocal minority.
---
LOL I still use it sometimes that or Skada
---
They literally nerfed the jump in Cata when they simplified the layout of the dungeon lol. That literally isnt meant to come off as rude by the way, I just find it so funny that blizz actually nerfed a map lol
---
Madseason needs to be in this ASAP
---
I'm so glad to weed out the gogogogogogogo crowd. It's WoW evolution really and that was a trip to the Galapagos
---
Those are so awesome.
---
He literally said he'd reply when he wakes up. Make sure to read the original post.
---
Yeah but actual items from raid content scales massively, so once you get t2, 2.5, or t3 they scale massively.
---
&gt; Not that I‚Äôd use it. I‚Äôm saving the experience for launch
---
Same. Well, kind of. If I were to get the beta, I‚Äôd play for the sake of trying to help Blizz as much as I can iron out bugs, but I don‚Äôt want the beta because others want it more than me (and therefore are more deserving) and I want others to test the game for me so that I have a smooth launch of the ACTUAL release üòÑ
---
Blizzard literally went from "you think you want that, but you don't" to "Classic is releasing at the end of August" - a huge part of the reason is because there was a _massively successful_ private server which was big enough to get on their radar.
---
Blizzard's legal team has been sending cease &amp; desists to private servers for years, but Nostalrius got big to the point where they just couldn't ignore it any more. If Nostalrius hadn't existed, they'd still be pretending players didn't want it.
---
that is so cool wtf
---
Fuck Nost devs
---
He sure as hell isn't used to playing a vanilla warrior though. Never used rend in low levels even though he specced 3/3 imp rend, he didn't use heroic strike while tanking, just sunders. He spams revenge but you need to block to get a revenge proc, and he didn't use shield block to proc it. Also while leveling up staves he used sunder to spam attacks (15 rage) instead of hamstring for the same effect but much more spammable (10 rage).
---
Not to mention the horrible tab targeting, back turned to mobs and rarely using taunt or taunting way to late when needed, or the fact that he didn't have battle shout up for half the instance.
---
With that said I enjoyed the stream, but if you believe he's some undercover vanilla warrior pro, you're mistaken.
---
The handy thing with that physical map is on the other side it shows all the flight paths and stuff. I'll probably use both; I'll have it on the wall behind my monitor.
---
i think people are looking at streamers that are about level 30 and going "wow they got there fast the xp must be messed up" and not taking into account that these are people that have been playing solidly since they got their beta invite and have probably be doing a lot more dungeons that you would normally do when you were levelling back in vanilla so it will seem like they are levelling fast
---
Good bot
---
Yea and thats a lot of streamers unfortunately. Its hard to shift from specific game streamer to personality streamer.
---
According to others in this very sub, they were MORE than clear that you HAD to 100% have a sub to get in. No question. 
---
Wonder where are those people now.
---
Sorry, I should have been more clear... Screenshot was before *I* got Benediction. I always thought it was a pretty sweet look. :D
---
No, I've kept my retail sub so I can log in and look at all of the mounts for five minutes, double jump climb buildings on my demon hunter, and the log out.
---
it‚Äôs fucking beta
---
Okay, cheers for the answers.
---
I dominated with a warlock in classic, a geared destro warlock properly used was unmatched in duels
---
Assuming the reverse engineered [formula](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit?oldid=291741) people found back in vanilla the formula for Mages and Priests is:
---
    (13 + S/4) = mana per tick, S=spirit
---
A tick in vanilla is 2 seconds.
---
Using your raw spirit value would put you at 20 mana per tick. 
---
Note when people were trying to figure stuff out they found out that the first 20 points of a stat don't behave properly. For example the first 20 points of stamina only give 1 HP each.. Can't find an old source but you can find it [here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Attribute#Stamina)
---
Using the knowledge above using your (Spirit - 20) for S, we get a tick amount of 15 mana. Which is close enough to your observed value to be written off as a rounding error. It's possible that the attribute is internally stored as a decimal value in the calculation and the human racial is screwing with it.

That's so gay, I can't believe 3% of viewers actually sub to these people
---
Speedleveling through a beta seems like a waste of energy to me
---
And in the first week or maybe few weeks ganking will be low.
---
Yup. I tuned in the stream for a few minutes just to hear what he had to say and he said he's submitted over 20 bug reports already. I wonder how many of those bugs are legit. My bet is pretty much all of them are not legit.

Really really depends on what's in between the warrior's hands.

It is in atm - I don¬¥t know what Phase the beta is tho

Recount is absolutely an authentic experience. I used Recount in my guilds first forays into MC in august 2005.
---
Hi, /u/Dao_Now
---
If you kept the sub since 2004 you are officially poor as fuck.
---
oh yeah, I forgot. I'm dumb, myb
---
Blizzard doesn't actually expect everyone with an invite to go out and try testing things and send bug reports.
---
Yeah I have, and funny enough i‚Äôm in a position to actively pursue it. Personally i‚Äôm going to go for it but at the same time if life gets in the way I could drop it.
---
Working from home on call makes gaming ez.
---
They‚Äôre top dog dps all the time now, back then we didn‚Äôt know enough so raiding gear was required.
---
'Very similar' How dare you, i hope you spill your cereals.
---
Lol, downvoting the fact that classic has poor viability?
---
Does anyone have the frames with just a black center? That way people can make their own.
---
Even with BiS, Might of menethil etc
---
I wouldnt say it would never happen without them, but it definitely sped up the process

---
Well it did have its upsides. Leveling was good and raiding didn't require a huge time sink, toy could just log on, raid, log off (though raiding content was slim).
---
Legion and BfA required so much grinding every day it was such a turn off. I quit because farming for legendaries and world quests became so lame
---
Everything. Okay so more specifically for my uses... you can track all your procs from weapons, trinkets, abilities, and have them all display graphics on your screen. Like say... mages with their instant Pyro. Instead of watching for that little golden square around the button, you could set it so when it procs a streak of fire appears above your character. When Slice and Dice has sub-6 seconds left the screen could flash. These are just some of the super basic uses, its insanely versatile.

Is 30 the cap for the beta?

Yes I've just seen soda got it, thats why I asked. I dont think beta has any phases, there were AQ signet quests in stormwind.
---
For some reason, I keep thinking you could go lower than that... maybe that‚Äôs just me. 
---
Yeah, I played 480p as well. At first I was pushing my PC‚Äôs limits trying to have the best graphics while slowing down the frame rate to 12fps (if only a few people were around - down to like 2fps if in SW on a busy weekend), but then realized that frame rate was more important than graphics, so I lowered everything as much as I could. Sucked because I had to lower the spell detail, so I couldn‚Äôt see paladin‚Äôs consecrated ground, for instance - only when he first activated it I would see the ‚Äúnova‚Äù from it but not the lingering glow üòÖ
---
Thats numberwang!
---
lol triggered much?! I just don't need help in games, especially in a 15 year old one. You go be all you can be though, haha!
---
Everyone did, and it was fine.
---
It's the best part of vanilla. no pvp restrictions. 
---
Use everything available at any point and outwit your opponent.
---
While Troll Priest is probably, almost certainly gonna be sub-optimal in Classic for both PvP and PvE, I just have always loved the voodoo doctor vibe. And the Berserking racial is just plain fun, even if it's often a bit underwhelming. 
---
Troll priest got better when they revamped the priest racial bonuses, whenever that was... I don't remember.
---
The 60 Sprint is typically a group effort too.
---
I'm not just insinuating account sharing. Teams will do things like level warlocks and run them, in advance, to key areas for summons to avoid upcoming long runs. Farm that one odd material for a quick quest turn in. Lots of stuff like that.
---
Joanna does have a team for this stuff usually.

I don't know much about human starting zone but for dwarf/gnome you will get just a bit over level 10 and the loch modan have great quests for 10-12 before it dries until you are around level 16 so level 12 =&gt; darkshore is a good plan there. For Night Elves, there are easily enough quests on teldrasil to get to 12 before going to darkshore. I think Teldrasil is the starting zone with the most quests in but I'm not sure about it.
---
right cause up until streamers went to irvine we were getting heavily restricted sharding.  now we're getting world-wide ~~sharding~~ layering which just so happens to be perfect for streamers to make a guild and own their own layer without 10k trolls following them around all day.  streamers have nothing to do with anything
---
Feb 2006 here. Let me iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!
---
That isn't true.
---
I personally feel the content of WoD was mostly good, mainly the raids, but there was literally nothing else to do.  You log in, get free gold from the garrisons, use that to buy a few tokens, log off until raid.
---
How can I check when my account was created?
---
a retail sub
---
Arms can be viable up through BWL if you go sword spec and have a good 2H sword, have hand of justice, and know how to weave slams in between instant ability cooldowns. Unless you're in a super hardcore progression guild where every debuff slot and spec must be optimized, one debuff slot getting consumed with mortal strike isn't the end of the world.

Thanks to Wotlk I would say

---
I subbed 12/1/2004, and played consistently through MoP. Dropped off a bit after that, no invite.
---
When in 2005?
---
Hopefully yes. People like their addons - especially the gearscore/raider io stuff, to easily form groups to the group content.
---
Lol this was alright
---
lmao no
---
Nope. It's additive. Hardiness + Iron-Will is about 50% stun resistance. You shake off pretty much every other stun attempt as an Orc warrior.
---
TBC knocked it down to about 40% total, but you still blocked a ton of stuns regularly.
---
I'm a speedrunner, but this run is more casual since I'm overseas, playing on an old laptop with a lot of lag. FWIW, game plays surprisingly well on a laptop not designed for games, at low res.

I still have people, when I talk about classic, essentially give the old "you think you do, but you dont" type of response... like believe me guy, I've been in pservers quite a few times. I think I do... and I do. It's still the game for me.
---
No I think beta priority should go to \[group i belong to\]
---
Nah it's just annoying seeing this sentiment over and over and over.
---
You can try their live chat, explain to them what you did here.
---
 For the best chances for them to help you, I would suggest not saying you want it for a better chance at Beta, as they might not service it then, just say you want to see your old characters. Thats how they did it for me.
---
0 effect as long as you listen and reply immediately in chat if spoken to.
---
Glad you could join us the second time around, friend.
---
You cannot see stealthed players unless you break them out of it, use an ability like perception or the warlock's felhunter pet, or you out-level the person significantly.
---
Didn't he play Rogue or something "safe" in Vanilla?
---
I played an orc shaman from feb 2006+, and I honestly don't remember. I'll be playing alliance this time around, so I really hope that orcs won't be resisting a third of my stuns, that would suck :p
---
What got him into the position for Blizzard to give him such information?
---
Rare are not different than normal mobs except they have a name and special respawn timer.
---
Elite are stronger. Then there are rare elite (silver dragon like a rare, but has a wing like the elite dragon, the normal rare does not).
---
Many people seem to not know there are two kinds of silver dragons, hence a lot of confusion.
---
Then don't run dungeons. Wait until you find out how long lbrs and ubrs is.
---
Or attunement to the core.
---
It would be cool to have some extra, *entirely optional* additions that the spirit of Vanilla, such as expanded weather effects that are a toggleable option. Wouldn't be a bigger departure than the options there already are for stuff like modern lighting, water, foliage density &amp; physics.
---
For example, very rare, but absolutely torrential monsoon rain in the Barrens.
---
streamers dont have anything to do with it, sharding would have actually been much better for streamers to avoid snipers. the reason layering is a thing is to make sure servers have long term healthy populations after the hype dies down and people who are just there to try the game out start to leave. layering lets servers be way above normal populations to give it space to die down while still being at a healthy amount later on so your server wont be empty. layering is also gonna help with queue times at launch.
---
I'm playing on a shitbox laptop since I'm overseas right now, and its native resolution is 3000 something. It let me downscale it to 720.
---
There is no reputation split that I've seen so far to level 20.
---
Yeah, I don't think leveling looks fast. I have watched a lot of Asmondgold recently and it's taken him 20 ish hours to get to 20. That ain't fast. At all.
---
Hi, /u/JussyPlays
---
They've been thinking about it for several of the last private servers. It's a piece of cake to change layers by the way they outlined it in the interviews. What else?
---
If you remember conslegion, AAP, the author used to be in my guild before I quit and hes working on a similar addon for vanilla that he's been coding through the 8.0 API.
---
The Pit People beta didn't wipe your save :-)
---
He was like 9 when it was out. What's the point of this?
---
There is the occasional hiccup, but it's robust in and out of water, etc.
---
Yeah, and this is huge.
---
Rogues beating hunters...lol
---
Right. Casuals are literally elitists in Classic. They think the only way to play the game is casually and competitive people won‚Äôt enjoy the game.
---
Yeah that sounds VERY reasonable to me. RR is traveling for horde, and even the gankers have to level...at least I would think. It shouldn't be a shit show until people start dinging 60 left and right.
---
Roguecraft was made in patches 1.11 and 1.12...
---
I actually never used a guide back in Vanilla. I did it the old fashioned way because I was in before any guides existed. Never used one for an alt either.
---
I'm considering using one this time around just because they just seem fun to me. Fun to see how someone else did it otherwise I'll just use my old fallbacks.
---
I will stream when I get home but right now I'm just trying to get it to run on this old laptop.
---
This was in Vanilla, and I hope they don't change it. They made a pretty firm stance on not balancing classes specifically to keep them in line with Vanilla so taking this out would contradict that.
---
I didn't say that. Those people will be hardcore and will make new strategies, that are even better. Imagine if there is a talent build that is way better than we know because it didn't work properly on private servers. Its just a speculation because, but it can come true.
---
You act like the 1st 2 days of beta are the only ones getting invited, how naive is that? Perhaps, blizzard actually might have more and more players trickle in to not only test their server loads and layering tech but also establish a wide range of players who will find the bugs.
---
Also, speed leveling is a valid test as well. There are many out there with previous vanilla guilds(like Joana) who want to test out it's affectiveness in classic and rework or report bugs that will differ. Plus others who have perfected level strats on pserver that will need to understand/experience the differences, even reporting those in case the pserver experience may be the correct experience. 
---
Will all that said, the beta streamers still serve as a promotion too, and that's completely fine in my opinion as well.
---
I'll take a screenshot next time I'm on
---
sadly
---
It helps that they were able to implement only the RS updates that people liked into OSRS, whereas RS3 is stuck as a result of their experimentation over the years
---
What's the female NE hunter stereotype? Honest question. I just like female NE and I'm planning to roll a hunter :(
---
Hey man love your videos!! Hope to see you posting some classic beta content to hold over those of us that didn‚Äôt get in
---
WAIT, HOW DO I GET TO LEVEL 10 WITHOUT THE GUIDE?!
---
I honestly have no idea. I had no idea who this hack was until a few weeks ago, as I learn more about him it's pretty clear a lot of what he says is BS. I wouldn't trust a single thing he has to say about WoW.
---
Nah, savor the fact that the first time you get to play Classic again will be on a server that isn‚Äôt going to get shut down. Your new journey will last forever.
---
I loved Highmaul and enjoyed, and this is basically what I mean. It just felt like there was even less reason to do stuff than there is in BfA. Amazing raids though, but it also introduced the Garrison stuff, which I'm opposed to more because of its massive impact on the economy, than the "ree facebook game!!!!" argument.
---
The only people Ive ever met who called it VC, don't use English as their main language. Chinese and South Americans mostly.
---
He honestly seems alright. I just can‚Äôt fucking stand that guy McConnell who he sometimes has on discord.
---
This subreddit is riddled with toxic people and elitist retards
---
I raided in one of the best guilds in the world, #2 us horde kt kill. Threat was never an issue, the tank and dps dying was the #1 issue. Healing and mana usage are ctitical and defense capped warrior with shield wall is mandatory. If you want to roll a bear tank, do it. No actual good guild would use it and I for sure as hell won‚Äôt join a noob guild like that.
---
I'm not a huge fan but where has he ever said he's a vanilla expert outside of druid dueling?
---
8 hours a day with no commute.  Do you not have a job?
---
There's a sticky for this.
---
President, not CEO. Difference being Activisions CEO is technically higher up on the corporate ladder than him.  Likely having more influence.
---
&gt;Fear is an alright cc
---
Yes but no. If people would make state of the art pulls (by being far away from the mobs and bringing them back to the group) yes, fear would be a great CC.
---
However with the rushing mentality that was already prevalent back in Vanilla, fear is useless in dungeons (unless you want an efficient way to wipe !).
---
Healers shouldn't be dpsing.
---
Because apparently theyre living in the world where things like decursive never existed lmao, vanilla had some insane addons
---
&lt;3
---
No problem, glad to be of service.
---
Exactly. It's the Shadowguard I mentioned.  It doesnt heal, but it proccs decent damage when you are attacked and can proc Blackout! That's so cool
---
The flipping incoming
---
Hindsight is 2020
---
Madseason is amazing, informative and doesn't talk 100 MPH... yes, pls give him BETA access cuz i can only listen to Kargoz for so long b4 i literally need to take a break to chill TF out.  He's just too much sometimes.
---
Try your luck on https://vanillafriends.com/
---
Can't replicate moonwalking. You can 100% vanish to immune incoming spells. Gouge kiting also works (gouge kited Vagash in Dun Morogh)
---
You're probably thinking of Recap. Recount wasn't added until TBC.
---
he doesnt get paid to answer questions about vanilla, hes getting paid because people watch his stream and sub to him, just like with every other game he plays. he isnt sitting there getting paid by blizzard for every question he answers. and theres alot of "vanilla experts" that are wrong because theyve been going off of private servers for the last 10 years or so, and we all know how inaccurate some of those are.
---
No. You'll be fine.
---
Yea, gotta be the best you can be in a 15 year old video game, I've written it down as a life goal. haha
---
I used to like this subreddit :(
---
Same, I‚Äôm too old to drink these now. I used to pound them (blue was my favorite) back in BC/ wrath days but I can‚Äôt drink soda like I used to.
---
Maybe they can come out with a new diet GameFuel for classic. Until then it‚Äôs low acid coffee and high caffeine tea for me.
---
It shines with the love he has for *WoW*
---
Even if he doesn't swoon over retail, you have to give him credit for still loving the game the way it is and being able to separate bfa from classic and never putting down either game.
---
Warrior leveling is a constant struggle of not biting your lip off and punching a hole in the wall.
---
I played Vanilla, Pandaria, and Legion. Still wish I‚Äôd kept playing to see the BC stuff when it was fresh or to zone into the Fjord when it was new content during WotLC. Those seem like fun times.
---
But to your point I enjoyed a lot of Panda, but I never liked the Garrosh as villain stuff.
---
EXACTLY
---
I know you're joking but for those that think you're serious, there's already a 1-12 leveling guide for Alliance on Joana's site, but he never made one higher than that level , we're finally getting it :)
---
Yup, I wouldn't even dare to enter in RFC without the perfect group comp ! /s
---
Lmfao so using an alternate search engine that doesnt spy on you makes you a white supremacist. Jesus fuck lol
---
They were announced together, yeah, you just don't need it to play classic, and it gives no benefit in classic like a pet or anything. Definitely inspired though! I wish that mousepad map was just the old map. -.-
---
is there a way to check how old my account is ? because i have my classic account merged to my bnet account.
---
Would be prety cool yea.
---
Do you maybe know if the quest item you pick up from the chest is tradable/sellable?
---
Lol the streamer hate on this sub is getting ridiculous

Haha, might be a while before I get to that one, but Tauren hitboxes are indeed massive af.

As are most the streamers I have been watching.¬†Most of them did not play classic, or played on a private server in 2012 at some point. I'm tilted that these peeps are the face of WoW: Classic it is a damn shame really.
---
I basically spent my entire vanilla rerolling alts in Westfall and doing this dungeon because I'm a huge noob. (NA Player)
---
I'd say I saw about 90% DM, 10% "VC" during those days
---
I've never been huge on soda in general, but I remember liking the Horde one a little bit. The blue was pretty gross iirc.
---
&gt; Elites in dungeons = 2.5 * XP
---
But is it BfA numbers or is it true for vanilla as well?
---
That's where you are wrong. The math has been done, and you're wrong.
---
Fuck, a bit hung over mate sorry!
---
Yeah the troll was always my fav race, unfortunately im going Druid or warlock ( easy leveling )
---
Oh I see. So the most upvoted doesnt matter much but you need to search for the less voted and negative posts to push your agenda? Sure mate. Can you see the irony? Maybe you can't.
---
This subreddit is turning into shit cause of posts like these.
---
The people who will race to be level 60 in a week are very few among the community I think most will still be faster than regular old vanilla due to the content available online but will take more time to enjoy it (not counting the people who will play casually)
---
And ganking levelling zones such as RR was more done by bored 60s I would bet, it's not STV where it always will be an active warzone.
---
I pray
---
The Arena Master is bind on pickup

Thats a nice idea for roleplaying. But I am not sure if i want to write a transgender story from a female human to a male Undead :-D
---
That's what my eyes are for.
---
I've used WA before in past expansions, but ultimately started finding it to be redundant. It was telling me information I was already aware of and actively working on, so it made my screen colorful and neat, but as time went on I got to where I ran no addons at all. Now, I'm not a raider or an arena guy, so my experience isn't for everyone. For the average player though...addons really aren't important. I would say you should certainly play most of the game without them and truly learn how to play your character. You should instinctively know your rotation and be aware of your buffs and procs, not wait for something to flash across your screen and then react to that. But that's just me.
---

Roll a troll because they got FUCKING HOLES IN THEIR SHOES.

Really.. I think most of them are serious ? They‚Äôre gratsing that guy that got ‚Äúworld first‚Äù level 30 lol. At the end of the day who cares who got ‚Äúworld‚Äù first level 30 in beta classic
---
True, but while you worry about all that shit and time and fight with the guild to get 2handers that are better for anyone for pvp.
---
or you go fury and mind roll the keyboard spamming heroic strike, blood thurst and top DPS easy.
---
Omg wheres the formatting

There goes my idea of making money.

Reason? spoopy
---
Throne of Thunder was among top 5 raids in the whole game
---
Why does it make him look bad??? It's a fucking game where mistakes can happen and he doesn't have to play perfectly just for stream. I don't get it why you have to a pro at the game to get accepted by this community.
---
Fall damage is too low, I reported this in the demo as well but it hasn't been fixed. I could jump from the top balcony of Malfurion's tower in Darnassus, which should have killed me (or nearly killed me), and only lose like 20% of my health.

Apollo let me zoom all the way in

An item that didn't exist on any bosses loot table.

but can you clear the safari
---
Yeah, wpvp starts to kick off in hillsbrad, stonetalon, ashenvale and by stv/desolate it‚Äôs the best
---
Nost was special. These pservers were also special. There's also a few more that I can't even name, or my comment will be removed by automod because they stupidly say it qualifies as advertising.
---
People do incorrectly attribute Nost as being the first actual blizz-like well scripted server... That was definitely Scriptcraft.
---
I tried to point this out and got banned, so the mods have gone rogue as well. Probably will need to create a new sub and actually enforce the rules correctly AND not ban people just because you don't like something they said.

Most players used it simply for triggers on reaction abilities or trinket procs. It displayed a graphic on your UI to show that the trigger or proc happened.
---
Though, it was highly configurable and extremely useful for a lot of other things, including resource management, buff/debuff checking, etc..
---
God forbid people strive to do well in their hobbies/interests.
---
I subbed impulsively and immediately refunded that transaction. My account is from 2006, I haven't played since the first week of Cata.
---
I'm just gonna wait. $15 is too much for a sub 1% chance to play a beta.
---
It's definitely in a terrible state right now. 8.2 looks like it could be fun, but I'm not sold on returning yet.
---
\+1 on live chat. Took less than 5 mins and the only thing I remembered was character names and realms + picture of my ID.
---
Hahahaha lmao Hahahahs lmao üòÇüòÇ lüòÇmüòÅüò≤ü§£aüòÇo hahaüòâüòÖü§£ü§£ü§£hahahaüòÇüòÇ
---
So. To be clear. You are not currently subbed. 
---
Blizz say to you: "Give us money and we will let you work as a software tester" 
---
&gt;Look forward to no new content after \~6 months.
---
So, you're saying classic has 6 times the longevity that BFA has? 
---
Ehh, I think it's more like 12 times at least. Retail is pretty boring dude.
---
That's why I said alright. If you're a shitty lock then it's not that good.
---
Huh? **better** launch, not earlier launch. A launch can go terribly wrong you know
---
I really hope so. If they start dumbing down the game because of these streamers feedback who only ever played pservers I'll be pretty annoyed.
---
Never played vanilla, never cared enough until my sister showed me nost. Even though i chose a paladin and only got to level 17ish had some good times meeting people, even if we never stayed in contact. Very relaxing time listening to music and getting destroyed by murlocs on westfall and cant wait to do it again, probably as another class
---
I dont have mod experience with wow, but am a software dev. If I get in, that's my primary focus. Specifically I want to attempt to get a version of clique working. Secondary would be icehud. These are two addons I've used forever.
---
"with meh" I didn't know you could be a 15 year old scene girl and an old man at the same time.
---
Lol yeah time an instant or a burst as a level 14 warrior,  or level 14 hunter, or priest, or Druid.
---
Dude at that level no one really has a burst ability that will kill them instantly once they run.
---
Don‚Äôt be a moron.  You can do things to avoid these situations, but they are goin to happen.  Period.
---
Imagine that literally every streamer who has ever said something misinformed or not completely true getting clipped and uploaded to reddit.
---
Oh, wait , that's just how it is. Has nothing to do with "hatind sodap."
---
Get over yourself.
---
Still shit unfortunately
---
Hey IDIOT, maybe you didn't realize that Staysafe was about to power spike and POP OFF.
---
There's nothing wrong with that, just don't be surprised when nobody is impressed you did something that's been done over a decade ago.
---
they weren't good, they just were less bad
---
And cata was better than both of them so if cata wasn't fun for you you didn't miss anything
---
I played private servers way back when they first came around and fucked about on GM servers and such. Always thought it was a fun "alternative" to WoW, because WoW wasn't shit back then.
---
When I logged into Nostrallius for the first time I had CRAZY nostalgia.

Our guild has been gathering 200+ people and we have always planned to play on a RP-PvP. If we don't get RP-PvP, we're forced to go PvP. There's a huge downside to this, since people that became friends during the last few month are basically forced to leave the guild since the RP aspect is just too important for them. Classic is about communities and these are in the making for months already... Don't tear them apart Blizzard, I beg you, this is a big deal for us.
---
Seems pretty unlikely. From what I recall in the interviews, the client they're using can straight up read the database for values like that. It would be so much extra work to make a scaling system interpret that data in a new way.

Be a true gentleman and drink sugar free Bawls
---
No I don‚Äòt, gonna google that.
---
Yall pretty much proved that people dont know how to joke anymore. It should be obvious right away that he is acting for jokes and memes.
---
So much of the dumbest things he says actually riles people up all the time, its sad.
---
I always played Horde on Twisting Nether (Rutilus Luna and Acumen) and never saw any RP outside of small pockets in Org and later Silvermoon. It was neat to see though, and it made the community feel bigger in a way. Even though I didn‚Äôt RP I would definitely try another RPPVP server. 
---
Another nice perk is that the community self-moderated itself against stupid character names that ruined ‚Äúclass fantasy‚Äù, such as xXxChkNorrisxXx
---
roguecraft 2 came out before 1.8 as deathcoil didn't have the horror effect.
---
Legion was great. I missed MOP &amp; WOD  but got Legion because it looked amazing with the Artifact weapon and it was.  I also am not an end game guy.  I just level and run dungeons that's my game.
---
In any software testing you're almost always going to have that dynamic - users that are actively looking/trying to break things and those that are just trying get through their scripts.  The latter isn't quite as helpful on the surface, but like you said it gives them data nonetheless and confirmation of things working (seeing quests they've done).  We have 3 months so Blizzard should get plenty of data in the end.
---
No. The gaming community has made itself a toxic mess.
---
Meh both communitys have factions that basically hate one another. There just strait up different games. No need to hate
---
I have seen a few posts of people happy that Classic is happening because retail can finally stop caring about raids and make it the mythic plus action game it was ‚Äúalways meant to be.‚Äù Lol
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not a lot of people.
---
&gt; Roguecraft was made in patches 1.11 and 1.12...
---
No? IIRC the last parts were at latest 1.10. Quick google puts [this part](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=6140) uploaded in august 2005. That's well before 1.11 or 1.12. That's what? [1.6?](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.6.0)
---
I subbed 2 days ago and got an invite yesterday, I don't know the odds but it worked for me.
---
I‚Äôm not knocking the raids, I just didn‚Äôt like the story.
---
Thanks for telling people how they should be playing the game.
---
Is there an addon to show how much health the enemy target has? I can‚Äôt remember what version it was that function became available? Early addons used to estimate the enemy health during the fight as you damaged them if I recall correctly.
---
Is it bad that I'm planning on imbibing something a bit more potent than Adderall for launch?
---
It's obvious to anyone who isn't intentionally dense that they worded it the way they did in the hopes that people would resub, hoping we would interpret it as "you need to be subbed to get an invite" and not "you can only log in with an active sub but can be invited without being subbed".
---
Based on me asking people in general on the beta. The first night was streamers, media folks (journalists, fan sites), blizzard related people. A few hours after all them got in a wave of invites went out to day 1 subscription accounts who are currently subscribed.
---
Yesterday evening, blizzard started additional waves of invites roughly every hour/45 min, those invited seem to be those who subbed 11/24/04 - 12/31/04. 
---
I stopped asking as general and world chat started to fill up. Could be into active 2005 accounts by now.
---
yeah yesterday he was running WC dungeon with other streamers like Soda, he was tanking the boss you see in the image and he died like in 1 or 2 shots and then reported what you also see in the image.. But turns out not only is the boss doing normal numbers of damage, but Tipsout was also with his gear all yellow and his chest piece was even red which means OBVIOUSLY he was getting 2 shotted because his armor was decreased since his gear needed to be repaired. Was a complete clown fiesta to watch him. Still it was pretty cool to watch how the dungeon went
---
I got to level 4 on a night elf Hunter. I basically mastered the Vanilla experience. I am the peak of a Vanilla Veteran.
---
&gt; At least on my server I frequently started the Thunderfury spam in Vanilla and people would follow
---
Did everybody clap?
---
He is still going to have extra global cooldowns to use. Heroic on hit, revenge is like 5seconds?
---
What is FnF?
---
Why wouldnt he be serious?
---
I love this. Real money bounties.
---
Is FF friends and family?
---
It's WC/DM not VC.
---
That entire zone was impressive. Mists pvp was pretty good too before all the big ability squishes. Timeless Isle was world pvp heaven too, I loved that expansion.
---
the thing is he didnt call the police on the death threat meme video, he called the police on alexsensual for commenting "lmao" on that video, which apparently means he endorsed it and prompted his viewers to make them.
---
You were doting in raids ? I thought even with 16 slots it was a no go.
---
1) That was probably because item names are loaded from server (and cached), and server doesn't know the name still
---
2) This is beta server, there could be some employees with forged legendaries (for funs or tests)
---
Did you have a hard time with gold? I'm thinking of rolling a prot warrior but everyone says I need loads of gold for some reason. Why?
---
It would've been damn cool if it did
---
I wonder if they could make it so all 200 of those iron bars are in one row with a note saying there are 200 of the exact same entry. Then you click buyout and it lets you select how many you want. 
---
No need to see 200 of the exact same post. I agree it's annoying.
---
XPearl? ShadowUnitFrame?
---
as the other person said its bop, but you can get the boe blue item from chest. Worst case if you vendor everything its probably like ~2g?
---
Not sure, I don't follow him particularly, I had more the weird cult and the crypto currency stuff.
---
yeah but he also claims "very very very few warriors in NA could beat me in a duel"
---
MoP is my favorite expansion, but I wasn't a huge fan of Garrosh as the villain either, more so now that the writers are so lazy they are doing it again with Sylvanas. The rest of the story was a lot of fun though.
---
It has Legion level graphics. Not the old old stuff.
---
If you ran legion fine you'll run classic fine
---
Oh the BfA fanboys with waxed eyebrows downvoting me, what a surprise!
---
yes, i'm retarded.
---
agree
---
Emerald dream was my first and best vanilla experience
---
Agreed. I really, really hope Blizzard listens.
---
The lag towards the end was unbearable.
---
There's a difference between not wanting WeakAuras because you're fine with how you're checking your procs/cooldowns and saying that WeakAuras is an automat which this dude did ("play the game for them").
---
It highlights information you find useful and group information. Same way you could move your buffs/debuffs/action bars but it does it better.
---
If you're fine the way you play, good for you, especially if you don't do competitive stuff.
---
The only eu people I noticed in the first day were ‚Äúe famous‚Äù 
---
The game came out later in eu, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they are flagged after the US 04 accounts.
---
Feels good telling people you played vanilla and they try to talk to you about MC and ZG and Rank 14. Talk to me about RFK and SM bro, I wasn't that good.
---
idk whats funnier, asmongold trying to pretend he wasn't upset after getting ganked or his fanboys who take this shit way too seriously coming in this thread and making themselves somehow look even more butthurt than asmon himself at the time
---
It's because the people against classic wow before it was announced were insanely obnoxious about it. Remember those smug 'wall of no' posts? Or how it was all rose-tinted glasses? How literally playing classic on pserver in the present and enjoying it was somehow invalid? How they insisted that the mangled turd that is retail is actually the better version of the game, and you should not go back in time because reasons? How they actively tried to cockblock the advent of classic every step of the way?
---
I don't think it's surprising at all that people find trolling those smug idiots satisfying as fuck now.  
---
I'm not condoning it, but it really was inevitable given the amount of anti-classic douchebaggery there was prior to the announcement. Especially during the Nost-shutdown era.
---
Blizzard made the change based on "Feedback" and whining how certain things are hard, time consuming and so on. One by one, little by little vanilla design was removed from the game.
---
People who hate on classic are Edgelords who just want attention.
---
Prove me wrong.
---
He's just projecting. He's either not that good or doesn't know how to use add-ons. So obviously the move is to ridicule them.
---
His channel first started to gather steam in late WoD when he was running viewer raids for the Moose mount that came from Heroic Archimonde.
---
Then his channel really blew up after he stopped progression raiding after Mythic Gul‚Äôdan/Nighthold.
---
I don‚Äôt remember him getting a lot of views while he raided Nighthold and once he took over GM and raid leading his streams were pretty toxic and not really fun to watch.
---
After NH he started doing a lot more viewer involved stuff. Mount offs, transmog competitions, viewer pugs. Project 60, 70, 80 etc. and he started to build a community around him. Watching his viewer involved streams reminds me of what it was like to play WoW back in the day when you often would end up doing weird guild stuff that was centered around Blizzard‚Äôs drip fed content. Asmon really works(ed) at putting the MM in the MMO.
---
After Legion I think some of his content started to get stale and unfortunately or fortunately BfA is so bad there is much there to entertain ppl. So now you have Asmongold reacts content where he just commentates on videos.
---
Asmongold‚Äôs channel has essentially turned into talk radio centered around WoW. It‚Äôs like listening to a sports talk show where the commentators shit talk your local cities awful sports team.
---
Yea I agree, this should be encouraged. These gankings would make the beta streams SO much more fun. It builds reputation, storylines, and drama. There's now grudges and hurt feelings. I can't wait.
---
If this Cpt kid keeps ganking, he can count on a new subscriber. This is world pvp in vanilla, no flying away, no running away from more mobile classes, getting attacked at the worst possible moment, unfairness, and nerd rage.
---
Yes, a couple of hours before the first wave of invites went out, I got my invite with last night's 2nd wave.
---
Let me iiiiin
---
VC wasn't used in retail vanilla, it started from the private servers with people not knowing that DM had 3 wings. Thus , now we have people in beta calling it VC when it's a clear indicator that they never played retail.
---
Awesome! I was in the Cartel back then and we would do most of our stuff out in the world. STV, goblin areas mostly.
---
It really was a great server even if you didn't RP. Nicer community, generally more of a chill userbase.
---
Not even toxic, just retarded. And it's the older generation that's the problem, the people who started to expect that they could wave a fat wad of cash in front of the devs for accelerated/skipped progression, instead of actually playing the game. 
---
People always forget that microtransactions weren't invented out of thin air, the market met an apparent demand and milked it all they could, no matter how much it affected the quality of the product. 
---
Consumers are consumers' worst enemy, not companies.
---
If anyone actually remember what xp the BFD mobs were worth I would be damned impressed. Different mobs give different xp
---
The best part was that vanilla leveling, at least as I perceived it, was more about the journey. These days you've got 110 levels to rush through in a blur just to catch up so you can start playing the game. In vanilla...your leveling experience actually *was* the game, and then max level had additional stuff to do, plus you were more or less at the top of the food chain in wPvP. Every level was meaningful, all the quests were a greater connection to the world because you were just an average adventurer back then, not some grand hero killing time and gaining XP to fight the next Mary Sue with the latest McGuffin so you could then watch a fucking cutscene of NPCs do stuff completely independently of any action or investment you might have had. You don't even appear in the scenes. Just watch as ~~The Lich Queen~~ Sylvanas does stuff and Alliance talks about doing stuff. Fun times!
---
Atleast esfand is knowledgeable
---
to be fair, everyone falls a few times, even if you've done it a billion times. i've been playing since vanilla and that jump still gives me a bit of anxiety
---
I don't know how to force the Fov, but to force the ratio in windows you can go to your graphic card settings (or windows settings) and choose a 4:3 resolution (and you can also choose to make it so that the image is scretched (but it's weird :3)
---
&gt;  sharding would have actually been much better for streamers to avoid snipers.
---
no it would not have?
---
Even world-wide sharing, you don't get control over who is in your shard.  with layering you get much more control over the people in your layer. anyway, we went from *Starter-Zone-Only* sharding, to a full world layer worse alternative.
---
with no sharding (except start zones) and no layers, streamers wouldn't be able to play.  sucks for streamers, better for everyone else who wants authentic vanilla.
---
&gt; layering lets servers be way above normal populations to give it space to die down while still being at a healthy amount later on so your server wont be empty. layering is also gonna help with queue times at launch.
---
yep, layering lets more people all play on the same server so that when hype dies down we get a bunch of even deader than normal servers.  if you don't pick the server everybody else is playing on your server will be empty.
---
Why.. wouldn't it matter? Regardless of if it was done years ago and has probably been optimized, this is a fresh start and getting something for the first time is still impressive. Some people enjoy being competitive and doing that sort of thing. Saying it doesn't matter seems a bit shortsighted.
---
On a related note does the BETA have any mod support at all yet?  
---
I've not seen anyone really talk about it or try making one.
---
Maybe we're very different, I find levelling to be an obstacle.
---
I'm not alone, else we wouldn't have boosts. I think I've paid for rougly 15 boosts at this point horde/alliance.
---
Thanks for stopping when you did.  Otherwise we'd have to wait longer.
---
ah Okey, during burning crusade his girlfriend had a suicide blogg cou ting down to her suicide (that was a anti campaign for suicides) but know he used to include her in thumbnails aloooot üôà
---
If this was available for keyrings, would buy.
---
you got the file for this? wouldnt mind using it for warhammer lol
---
You haven't figured out how to do that without addons?
---
Right there with you. Didn't find another gig as a visiting professor. I'm trying to take it as a positive, means I have some time to chill out, and I'm sure I'll find another job outside academia.
---
I added a sub about 2 minutes after the blue post that said you needed one
---
100% bosses did dumpster you like that when you play as badly as tips. hes running around with half the armor he should have, not using shield block which means he can get crushing blows much more easily, and not even using demo shout so the boss has more damage than it normally would. and hes probably got all greys on or something so no extra stam, asmongold tanking DM had 30-40% more hp  than tips at the same level
---
The top two posts on the front page there are pro classic lmao. Safe to say they‚Äôre excited too.
---
&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if they re-release the expansions when people get bored of classic.
---
Which would result in the same debate again for the past 15 years.
---
People don't want the game to move on. People seemingly hate change.
---
And that's how you made friends. It's so much more difficult these days in retail because it's not an organic thing.
---
Resubbed a few hours before the first wave of beta invites went out, got an invite with yesterday's 2nd wave. Account was created Nov. 2004 hadn't been subbed since like January 2019.  NA account.
---
How do you feel about the Tauren warstomp weighed against its huge hitbox and its lack of stun resist as a hunter? Do you feel like maybe an Orc female hunter would be a better option with its smaller hitbox, more pet damage, and stun resist? I feel like with the hitbox, the warstomp doesn't give you THAT much distance from melee classes. It's certainly not like a druid who can warstomp and cc a melee and get away.
---
it doesnt matter, he literally had 2 defensive abilities that he just didnt use because hes bad. demo shout and shield block would make that not possible.
---
You're quite welcome. Would you feel better if I was a streamer and told you how to play the game?
---
This is what people demanded. We wanted a return to this. 
---
*Play* the game. Don't have scripts do it for you.
---
That's where we are different I guess. I'm still going to play it, I still sub every month I still love the game, I'm aware how different classic is to BfA and why it will exist. I'm not against it, I just think it's dangerous for Blizzard to compete with themselves in all honesty.
---
I mean, I do...
---
Harry Potter and the [Curse of the Elements]
---
Honestly I haven't got time for the beta, I just don't want to miss naming day in mid August :D
---
&gt; and he is generally pretty knowledgeable
---
That, he isn't.
---
Doesnt matter none of these kills mean anything. We have all killed this shit years ago world firsts for classic are a joke.
---
Yeah stv was so terrible but also amazing at the same time. But fuck waiting for 15+ min respawn quest mobs
---
Thanks for this! I checked my launcher after reading this and I had an invite! Can't wait to play when I get back from work!
---
I for one am excited that Ironforge will be the center of Alliance activity again.
---
ROCK AND STONE
---
and *you‚Äôd actually see them again*
---
Icehud can be recreated easily through weakauras if you don't want a separate addon for that functionality
---
Except asmon didnt play until the very end / pretty bc patch , he's even said so on his stream as well as McConnell calling him out about it. I think the only reason people are trashing on him so hard is he talks like he's this great source of knowledge for classic and when people watch him they can tell he isn't and doesn't play like someone that's been playing since 2004 does.
---
EU or NA ?
---
I think most of this sub doesn't *get* streaming. Even the tipsout bullshit I don't understand how it's such a big deal that he deleted a cloak on a *beta*. I don't know the guy but it's obvious that it was just a joke for the stream/banter.
---
I was on Icecrown server from Launch at we all said ‚ÄúVC‚Äù
---
Everyone just wants to play and feel they can contribute to the test.
---
It does suck watching people play when thats all you want to do, but It is better than if it was NDA locked or something.
---
NA, sorry. Subbed since day 1
---
It was so ridiculous seeing people have 3 legendaries before I had one (partially due to a bug), and then not getting a class legendary and expected to just grind anything for a small chance to get it.
---
Purest of RNG
---
No fucking thanks
---
You had me at the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I was gonna comment "just play the game and report shit you run into"
---
Hi, /u/Voops1
---
That's what I said, basically. :)
---
Engine updates (shadows, etc.) are not real updates in my eyes. Those just come "free" with with the modern engine. (But after quite a few comments I see now that for a lot people that kind of thinking can be confusing. :)
---
I really don't think they'll update the art assets. The smart choice for them is to put the Classic team to work on the expansions after release.
---
That's pretty new to me, what you just said. I really haven't heard evidence of the nodes being cut up into portions like that and it makes little sense. Sound unbelievable to me but also very unpleasant if true.. which it isn't.
---
Well, if you don't remember, then don't post it as a bug report
---
You don't think it's pretty similar?
---
Hamstring, Conc shot, roots. I‚Äôll give ya priest tho, they fucked. 
---
And I said shit is gonna happen, it‚Äôs Vanilla. There are plenty of options to mitigate it.
---
Can someone give a pretty accurate triangle for which classes beat who in 1.12? Let's just assume each class is rank 10 geared
---
&gt; I've noticed as the beta has started, a lot of people have started to promote hatred towards content creators and other people too because of their lack of knowledge about classic wow. 
---
I think its just content creators in general, not calling you a child, but the metrics on classicwow are probably show a much older group, than those coming from twitch expect this place to be as open as any other subreddit to more and more childish things.
---
Got 'em!
---
It emulates the pattern of enabled narcissism we see in the real world within WoW itself. I don't see how that's anything but a shitty feature.
---
Staysafe, Asmongold, Esfand.  
---
Esfand blithers a bit some times and Asmongold has a heavy dose of sarcasm. Staysafe hits a happy medium for me; I enjoy his commentary.
---
You can also do this weird thing where you pull from range and bring the mob backwards. Pretty nifty
---
Cosmos is a name i haven‚Äôt heard in 14 years in that respect.
---
She has a point.
---
Is it ‚Äúfastest to run a marathon while wearing a number of shirts more than 1.‚Äù
---
Or ‚ÄúMost t-shirts worn while successfully completing a marathon.‚Äù
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
And now you're going to ruin Classic for us?! /s obviously
---
Oh fuck off with this handholding garbage.
---
Orc racial for sure outweighs warstomp in wpvp, and being Tauren makes it easier for someone to melee u from farther away. The only place where a Tauren is better is organized premade pvp, where you have on demand CC to further immobilize an fc for example
---
&gt; , I‚Äôd play for the sake of trying to help Blizz as much as I can iron out bugs, but I don‚Äôt want the beta because others want it more than me 
---
As someone who doesnt care for playing the beta, youre the one I want to get the inv lol.
---
AMA!! *answers nothing*
---
Ha! now I can prove to all those fuckers who doubted I played during Vanilla!
---
Pretty much lol.
---
I'm pretty sure they already know about what percentage of players will be on each server type, they have over 10 years worth of data on that.
---
I think they are worried if they make an RP-PVP server, it will be a dead server.
---
&gt; For the first time in years I considered taking a sick day from work and playing wow
---
&gt; Even 2 of my 3 kids old enough to play games are excited to try it.
---
.... really?
---
https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=1951
---
FWIW: I resubbed the day they announced the beta. I first subbed on 12/27/2004 and remained subbed more often than not through all of vanilla.
---
If the thing he reported is wrong nothing is gonna happen I don‚Äôt understand the hate Boner  for streamers on this sub
---
People used Questie in Vanilla.
---
I think it is a response to parts of the classic community's weaponized autism that also wont acknowledge things that have made modern WoW a more rich experience than classic in some regards. Combat, class balance and difficulty in raids to name a few. Classic has many aspects which I enjoy more than modern WoW, but it would be wrong to say that modern WoW is worse in every way. Both communities have their bad apples that sours the experience for the rest of us. So can we all just tone it down on the forums and each person can enjoy the game they like to play. I bet most of the trolls will stop if they dont get fed.
---
What did I say wrong?
---
Frostdamus is a very well known EU classic wow content creator. Didn't get access. We just need someone to confirm 100% if there is any beta access for EU ACCOUNTS.
---
Remember, if you are in EU doesn't mean that the account is automatically EU.
---
How was your route? I noticed it was 5 hours slower than joanas 1-30 in his wr run, do you think that came down to some differences in the beta and the original or were you just slower on your own.
---
Especially if you added them to your friend list to call upon/be called on later. It was fun to network.
---
No addons yet, and the client being used now is the retail client, not the old vanilla client.
---
Because he reported Verdan's damage as a bug.
---
And a lot of those will not play Classic (because it's not free, "private servers are closer to Vanilla than Classic because of no layering", etc.).
---
It's an educated guess, based on calculations I'll not repeat here. Ultimately I don't really care. There will be enough players. ;)
---
Meanwhile - Joana only TODAY got his fucking beta invite?!

World first has been a twitch meme for a while now, it comes out like every single time Asmongold does an old raid or any PVE content basically ...
---
Even "world first warfront loss" "world first lfr wipe"
---
Fuck ya, he's the best.
---
You're telling me you know how much hp mobs have? Can you guess exactly when your next swing is up as a melee? You'd rather drag individual raid frames on your UI to heal? The list goes on.
---
Again, I'm not shitting on you for not using add-ons. Just don't be an asshole because you don't understand their importance
---
Every time I‚Äôve tried to get old friends back I to WoW they‚Äôve brushed me off only to come back for the worst expacs possible.
---
Given the way he leveled I'm going to guess he's has a lot of recent experience on pservers and he's not so much going by memory.
---
It is a different direction. Not a bad one for everyone.
---
Hi, /u/loveshisbuds
---
These theory crafting meters were the worst part about the game, and you can draw a direct line between this and the Mythic+ timed Facebook game that LARPs as an RPG while spamming interrupt notifications at you that retail has become.
---
We'll probably get a lot of working BfA addons and very few vanilla ones
---
That... actually sounds pretty neat! If retail dropped the pretence that it is not diablo 3 with a Warcraft coat of paint and just embraced what it has become, I would probably enjoy it a lot more.
---
Then all they would need to do is release a PvP style game like the old Guild Wars PvP-only characters system.
---
An MMO, a party based ARPG, and arena PvP game and, with WC3:Reforged, an RTS. All my gaming needs covered by Warcraft. Now I just need a Warcraft/Civilization crossover....
---
It's a different direction. Not a bad one for everyone though.
---
TIL a stag fucked the moon and make Cenarius
---
As much as people yell about un-blizzard like, dynamic respawns were the best thing to happen to the private servers
---
Hi, /u/Icosiol
---
this may be cliche, but honestly the best/most efficient way to learn to pvp well (for me at least) is to just pvp. guides etc can only get you so far since you're fighting against actual people and they're unpredictable.
---
Private servers will immediately die completely
---
A dad calling in sick in order to play video games? Doesn't really send the right signals. But that's none of my business.
---
What? He didn't say anything of the sort....?
---
It was already in development before shutting down nostalrius. I wouldn't be surprised if nostalrius helped them get a bigger budget for faster development, but blizz certainly knew the interest and market was there.
---
In the exact same position. Seems like only NA accs are getting invited
---
\*Curious people
---
It's a pet peeve as mine that some find cynicism a virtue.

Cynicism != desire to test &amp; explore

I subbed impulsively around 4AM and immediately refunded that transaction. My account is from 2006, I haven't played since the first week of Cata.

I think that may be confirmation bias of where we're getting the info.  The people who are excited about it and talking about it are the people with older accounts.  So we're only seeing those people report getting into beta.
---
We give a fuck when he starting submiting false bug reports that may damage our game
---
Something where quests take place? So you don‚Äôt want to play classic then.
---
watch his duo-leveling workshops.
---
Probably surprised you‚Äôve been subbed since day 1 and never took a day off of work for WoW
---
this is basically the history of my wow carrier, just include  2 years at a wow ltk private server for 2 years cause i had no money for monthly  subs
---
XP formula was well documented, you can probably google it then check yourself it was correct.
---
Didn't know that lol. Recently did it on a pserver and it was easy too
---
Is there something wrong with a dad who works hard and spends a lot of time with his kids to take a few hours to himself to do something he wants to do?
---
The shaman was leveling as resto I added him to my friends list on every toon
---
After Arthas the whole ‚Äúhero turned bad‚Äù thing felt cliche to me.
---
Meaning all vanilla addons will crash, some BfA addons won't
---
So everybody will roll on Blackcrow which is pre-bis for Hunters.
---
Just remove mouse over macros from classic, problem solved, they weren't a think in vanilla anyway.
---
It really isn't greed. They said they wanted a small dedicated group to beta test the game so they chose people who are the most dedicated to WoW. If you still have an active sub and have been playing since Vanilla you are pretty damn dedicated. 
---
It takes almost nothing to log in to your account and click a button. People who are willing to pay at least $15 shows that they are willing to spend time to test the game.
---
I've been playing BfA since it was released and there's always something to do. I'm not arguing there are no issues with retail, but it has long term appeal because there will be more expansions in the future.
---
Here's the video: [link](https://youtu.be/fTnFuUUXHYk).

Oh, hope so! Had lots of gold so got some gametime left from that! Fingers crossed!

They haven't released DM yet. /s

Is swirly ball back? Or are Rogues ball-less?

I have a screenshot of myself prowling by nessingwary, with so many skeletons on the ground that you could barely see the grass. I love that damn zone.

Unfortunately 8.2 won't do much for class game play so it's DoA for me.
---
Can't tell if cereal or /s
---
Don't end it all.
---
I remember fucking around on a TBC server back when TBC was the expac, the server admins name was Coolmanbob and IIRC he did a fair bit of work on the Mangos scripting.
---
Can you explain me why every hunter always choose humanoid slaying instead of deflection ?
---
3% more damage on a 2000 aimed shot (which pretty much requires ahsjrethul) will get you 2060 damages.
---
I'd much rather have a chance to parry a mortal strike than have 60 more damage.
---
Of course I'm talking about PVP here. In PVE you don't care about deflection.
---
oh look, another post about some e-celeb I'm apparently supposed to know/care about. how original.

This shit is going to be nuts lmfao
---
Well, agree to disagree, or at least it depends on what you mean by action rpg, but it does prove that people are split on what they want out of an MMO these days.
---
This is how WoW is meant to be played. Dont tell everyone the secret.
---
Smart man!
---
Actring like a retard was always the easiest way to get millions of viewers on youtube.
---
Ohhgee Haptix Gaming also a great channel.
---
Are you familiar with the area I am talking about where most people die to pilligers?  There isn't much room to pull them.  Unless you are just pulling the ones on the outside of the town.  In which case, yeah you can do that but it's going to take forever if you are just waiting for those spawns specifically.
---
Not to mention the crazy variance even between legionaries. I remember there was a DH and Mage one specifically that were 10x better than the next best legendary.
---
Hi, /u/Volodorz
---
Uhh no it wasn't.  When they met with the Nostalrius devs they were considering using the Nost code because they didn't have back ups of the original server data.  They later found a back up on a old hard drive.
---
Blizzard isn't going to acquiesce to bug reports like these. They have the data from back then in their reference client. Any reports on damage and armor values of mobs is not going to be considered, since even private servers didn't have that info. Blizzard, however, does.
---
What has WoD to do with anything? People were swarming to private servers since forever - since vanilla launched (myself have been playing on various private servers for about one year and a half before I could afford getting the official wow in january 2006). The private servers had a ton of users since Vanilla, same in TBC, same in WotLK and in literally every single other expansion since then. People were also quitting in the millions from WoW since TBC, same in WotLK, same in Cata and so on - each expansion has a ton of ppl that say "this xpac was terrible for me so I quit". And also each expansion (literally no exception) saw a big number of people (both ingame and on the internet) saying "this xpac is by far the worst in wow's history. It's funny how MoP was openly criticized by a big portion of the playerbase for being the worst xpac (including many ppl that were like "omg pandas? Blizz went so low now", then it came the "WoD = worst xpac" crowd and at the same time the "MoP was really good" crowd; then, what do you know, do you remember Legion? First months were dominated by the "this xpac sucks, so much grinding, not fun" crowd - all of a sudden now in BfA, everyone remembers Legion as being "so damn good".
---
For TBC/WotLK noone would care about the millions people quitting, simply because we'd get official numbers showing that the new players coming into the game was higher, resulting in a net overall playerbase increase. Statitically, it's since WotLK that the playerbase started to decrease, and not because more ppl quit in WotLK than in the previous xpacs, but because they couldn't get as many new players into the game.
---
Do you happen to have any statistics showing how many people quit in each expansion? Ofcourse not, you're just basing your thinking on popular culture, if someone on the internet or you and your friends said WoD was the worst, resulting in you looking for a private server, you think that's how the entire playerbase did. 
---
Again, private servers were popular since 2004, they still are, and they will always be. It doesn't matter that Blizz is releasing WoW Classic - the private servers will continue to exist - for one, because they actually offer the actual vintage, vanilla client (while Blizzard is only emulating the vanilla experience, but in the modern wow client) -- but most importantly, because the private servers **are free**. There's also TBC, WotLK, Cata, MoP and even Legion private servers, so those will be completely unaffected by WoW Classic. So because these are free, that means that even if there were BfA private servers, they could very well have 1 million players - simply because they're free. It wouldn't matter that BfA would be bad, if it's free, many players would play there.
---
He's referring to a quote by Ion, not quoting the other user.
---
Couldn't agree more, we need RP-PvP.
---
Ey, too early for dick jokes mate.
---
&gt;The Overall skill level is better because people have been playing the damn game for 15 years now! I seriously don‚Äôt understand how you don‚Äôt get this!
---
Ah yes. This explains why I became a kickass skateboarder after only a day of practice. It had existed for decades at that point after all! Also explains why current pros are twice as good as Tony Hawk. 
---
It's these kind of things that just escapes us sometimes. When something has simply been around for a long time people just get better at it naturally. *Thank you* for enlightening me.
---
&gt;Even if the average player is shitty now the average player in vanilla would be twice as worse!
---
Haha. This fucking statement! I can't even. Thanks for the genuine laugh, mate. 
---
**We ArE twiCe aS GoOd noW! RoFl taLeNtLEss oLd gUArD!**

Mangos and scriptcraft weren't servers, were they? Mangos is the core, and scriptcraft I believe is a db for the scripted world?
---
&gt;  all the way through to Cata and quit mid Cata and came back for MoP launch, played all of MoP and WoD and quit towards the end, came back late Legion. Everyone was saying how great it was and I felt like I missed out so I decided I would play the ENTIRE of BFA
---
So basically you never actually quit, you just took short breaks lol.
---
I also want to know this, I merged my original account with Bnet. so I'm curious to know this as well, my original character was made 5-16-2005, but my earliest achievements say 2009.

Did you get an email or anything ? Or you just gotta check the launcher
---
Female troll priest is top tier for looks, so there is that.
---
This is BULLSHIT. All these vendors on ebay have dozens of CE available and jacked up the prices. Why are we still allowing people to buy more than 1-2 of any type of limited quantity?
---
I very much enjoyed that, thank you
---
Making the game tailored towards any sub group of players is a bad idea. Mythic raiding is tailored towards hard core players and is simply too hard for the average player. There is a fuck ton of player who could play 10 hours every day and would never kill uunat on mythic. And they know that. Which is bad.   
---
In Classic even average players can achieve r12/13 or raid naxx if they just put in the time. Invest time and you will be rewarded. Thats fun for everyone.
---
You need help to know how much hp a mob has? uhhhhh, ya, I'm done chatting. gl out there

Hakuna your tata's my dude.

It's been 2 days.

Im able to load addons, just havnt gotten one to load without an exception yet. 
---
This is the official classic client (it will launch with the retail client), there will be no vanilla client. 
---
I‚Äôm planning on trying Details/Skada next.
---
In classic we alt tabbed googled that shit.
---
Here's an example of this https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralIntelligentHedgehogNononoCat, pretty sure aggro radius for mobs +-2 around your level should be greater than this.
---
Albion online has a better auction house...
---
Also "plz fix to be more like private server!"
---
What are you basing this on exactly?
---
Uldir BoD and CoS have definitely been excellent.
---
Mists was kinda the killer for me. It was ALRIGHT people dont understand that's when pvp started to die off slowly and pve became more open to the general player group, nothing wrong with it per say but people got less dedicated because it wasnt required. Legion was a small improvement but pvp died and raiding became something to do just because. Now theres nothing except 
---
"Link 2200 from 9 xpacs ago even tho the meta and 4 classes got added" 
---
And 
---
"Link every dungeon anything 10+" when the leader is running gear level of a fucking cat wearing a sweater expecting a carry. God forbid you dont have perfect I.O score and you cant do shit
---
Yeah it was great. Blitzlike for me doesn't mean everything needs to be exactly how it was. Everything should feel like it was. If you have double the players which is great you have double the respawn so it feels the same but actually better.
---
Except the rain in zuldzar is bugged by phasing
---
Do we use the live recount or is there a branch?
---
This hurts so much because I feel the same way.. I've NEVER in my life thought "I wish summer was just over already"...I am this year.
---
I'll just say that if you were to take all the addons away and leave only one for everyone to use, then that would be WeakAuras. It's the most flexible and versatile addon there is. With just that one addon you can play the game almost like you'd do with all your addons, only you'd have to create some stuff from scratch. But the potential is there.
---
aren't two of those DM's basically pointless to run? i remember no one ever did those instances or something
---
Oh! That rings a bell, yeah. They had the same red top-bar, right?
---
&gt;They obviously are only guessing on a lot of number-based things
---
I agree, you might be completely wrong.
---
Either through account history (payments). Or you can contact them directly, Took about 30 minutes of waiting for them to respond to my ticket and 3 minutes of them getting the data. 
---
I couldn't use the history because I recovered that account later and the payment history wasn't there.
---
i actually kinda liked WoD. didnt think it was that bad (except for garrosh dying)  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Following :)
---
I'm sure they won't just nerf bosses because people submit that their damage is a bug.  They'd probably go back to check the original source to verify that all the damage values are the same.
---
I was on Gorefiend NA and we used VC back in vanilla...
---
Yeah it's very clear he's being sarcastic all the time. And if you have any doubts about his game knowledge, just watch him commentate the world first races. Dude knows his shit.

Who said that? that clown tips out? the clown that made  a 1 h run in to a 3h one single handedly? 
---
That guy is vanilla wanabe expert.
---
I leveled my mage with an arcane spec when I rerolled on RP-PvP server release. My reasoning was that back then instant Arcane Explosion was considered a must for dungeons (and you had to spec arcane for it).
---
It sucked exactly as much as you will have expected, but I was able to AoE grind with AE a bit, keeping my leveling quite efficient (or at least I thought so at the time).
---
Stop with this world first shit
---
what have we seen thats not supposed to be in vanilla? are you talking about the bugs that were seeing in a BETA? because thats what betas are for, to find mistakes and fix them. the entire purpose of classic was to make a historical recreation of vanilla as it was back then, and they have a working 1.12 client from 2006 to base things off of. theres no reason anything will be any different then it was back then. theyve even said that they want it to feel like if you were to have gone in a coma in 2006 and wake up and be playing classic you wouldnt notice a difference.
---
Imagine thinking that people weren't powerleveling in vanilla and that this wasn't their first MMO.
---
&gt; hey obviously are only guessing on a lot of number-based things...
---
Who is that obvious to?
---
&gt; We've already seen a lot of things in Classic that weren't in vanilla
---
Things like what exactly? And please provide actual vanilla proof, not some private server bullshit.
---
I had a guy at my job quit recently so he could work on "growing his brand." He has a child.
---
I knew there would be no vanilla client, i was trying to explain that because this isn‚Äôt 1.12, that‚Äôs why things won‚Äôt work from 2005-2006.
---
Can you possibly come off any more insecure?
---
iirc the game had no or very few non-PvP titles until TBC

 I didn't see Stranglethorn until I was already a man

There are yes, but that doesn't mean they aren't going to happen.  Acting like you're super wow player 9000 and telling us stuff we already know and acting like a bad pull is never going to happen to you is what we are criticizing you for my dude.  No one plays it perfect, everyone dies sometime while leveling.

Yea, trying to level the last 3 classes I've never really played. After about 2 hours of flying around knocking off a quest every minute or so, I lose motivation.
---
Scaling is great in giving you more area options, but there should be mobs in every zone that at least are yellow, if not red. The scaling feels like it leaves very few dangerous mobs. That is probably the worst bit so far.

They already sent out two waves so it's probably every 2-3 days rather than weekly, unless they manually decided to send a second wave then probably a week after the first invites.
---
Interesting point about the extra cc in a group pvp setting.
---
What do you think about hunters surviving a FAP rogue with all his cooldowns? Back in vanilla, almost no one had the pvp set of trinkets, gadgets, grenades, and consumables. Most just had their pvp trinket and maybe a health pot. So countering rogues back then was as simple as flaring under yourself and setting a trap. But now, with reflect frost, FAPs, trinket stuns, etc, how can a hunter even in a wpvp scenario survive a rogue who can FAP and sprint twice? I feel like rogues hard counters hunters in 1v1 at this point.
---
I wasn't there for Vanilla, played during Wrath.
---
Looking forward to Classic's release purely because of the opening of the floodgates, it really isn't something to miss, as someone that played Oldschool Runescape from launch.
---
You can literally set it up to tell you your optimal rotation and any boss mechanics, it‚Äôs not needed in vanilla.
---
Few days probably. They typically do weekly invites, as far as I know.
---
They won‚Äôt.
---
Back in the vanilla days, there was a guy who had an art and design degree who made a bunch of animated designs and artwork and maps for blizzard.
---
He kept sending them stuff and never getting an answer till he went as far as setting up a table outside their offices and tried flagging down devs and ‚Äòsuits‚Äô as they went to and from the building. Not being annoying about it, but just asking if they‚Äôd like to see what he worked on and trying to get a career doing what he loved.
---
If I remember correctly, they were quite good.
---
Well, eventually they called the cops. Told him to leave for trespassing even tho he was on the sidewalk which may or may not be public property (some states have laws about this), AND they ‚Äòconfiscated‚Äô his portfolio and materials because it was ‚Äòmaterial developed using an established copyrighted entity and trademarked under their IP‚Äô.
---
He sported good feelings about it all and I last heard he still never was giving up. Last I heard about him was around the end of burning crusade...
---
But that goes to show they don‚Äôt care how much effort someone puts in surprisingly.
---
If anyone heard of this guy and knows anything else of the story please do tell. I may have some parts misworded or incorrect but the gist of the story is guy went to blizz with good proof of his skills and they gave him zero fucks.
---
Fair enough. That's still before the talent rework in 1.12 though.

Aggro range feels too small for mobs around (+-2) from your level https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralIntelligentHedgehogNononoCat, aggro range appears to be &lt;8-10 yards, feel likes it should be more around 12-15 yards.
---
no one knows. likely though they will do slow rollouts every few days. if you don't get invited in the next few days, you'll very likely be invited into the stress test on weds/thurs of next week

I won't claim to know \*every\* boss that was immune to cc/snare effects, but I very distinctly remember the common strat of having a hunter kite the final boss of UBRS out of his room. So automatically reporting that as a bug is crazy to me.

Yeah this seems like one of many things that could fly under the radar when trying to shove this patch into a modern client.
---
Ah nice, thanks very much, apparently I started 2 weeks after BC launch 30/1/2007.
---
I'll keep the thread up in case anyone else wants to check.
---
&gt;AMA about whatever you want regarding Classic, Leveling, Mages, etc. I'll respond tomorrow when I wake up!
---
Hurrr
---
RP-PvP was released months into vanilla when people and their friends already had established characters on RP-servers. If they'd release RP-PvP the same time as RP you'd for sure see a completely different story.
---
Also, if you look at polls (sure, not 100% correct info but one was over 40k+ people answering) RP-PvP is more sought after than RP in classic.
---
 "AMA about whatever you want regarding Classic, Leveling, Mages, etc. I'll respond tomorrow when I wake up! "
---
Fury actually has a harder time getting the appropriate gear. Arms can focus more on attack power and crit since the hit cap is much lower for 2handers than it is for dual wield. Fury will also be trying to get hand of justice since it's basically best in slot for all melee DPS until AQ40/Naxx so what you're saying isn't true. The only real "challenge" in the arms rotation is slam weaving, and even then it's not that hard.
---
"You can order you characters in the character select screen. No changes by the way :) :) :)"
---
Yeah, thats just posting.
---
Not the same. 1.12 changing targets dropped em.  Pre 1.4 deselecting your target whether you changed target or not would remove them.
---
It's a rainy F5 kinda day.
---
I have been able to backstab neutral creatures by running past them and spamming backstab before combat starts and it will land everytime.  
---
Once combat is initiated I cant get it to frontstab to contact on a mob.  
---
It is possible to stand back to back with a player and backstab them while you're both facing away from eachother.
---
It's still kinda fun... ^^^kinda...
---
No it does not, on private servers
---
Tauren Master race. They are hands down the best looking!
---
Yeah I played DAoC before WoW and everytime you died you lost a chunk of your exp to next level, even if you were killed in open world PvP. I saw rested exp in WoW and was like "wtf?"
---
ive seen posts of people saying they get into the beta every couple of hours, so it seems like 2-3 times a day maybe? not sure what they do exactly
---
I really don't care if people want to cheapen their experience. I just figured I'd recommend people use this glorious opportunity to play the game and enjoy it for what it used to be.
---
I can understand the use of Recount for raiders really needing to perfect their rotations, and I guess WeakAuras especially for PvPers really trying to be competitive. But quest addons just seem...I dunno. I feel like over the years people became far too dependent on addons rather than playing the game and learning/mastering it on their own. Take away the tons of addons and suddenly it's like taking the Force away from a Jedi and watching them stumble.
---
But I'm also aware that unpopular opinions are punished *harshly*. I need an addon to deflect downvotes.
---
A lot was fixed, the biggest being diminishing returns on cc's. But the rogue is still by far the best 1v1 pvp class until warriors get ridiculous gear. Even then, the rogue wins a large percentage of the time. If anyone wants to be good at pvp, go rogue.
---
You lose the buff if you unequip it.
---
This will be my play-style when Classic is out.

I'm more interested in atlasloot and atlas, I know most of the world pretty well but I like optimizing quest routes in big loops so I like having a fully uncovered map right from the start.
---
Also looking at atlasloot to see if a dungeon is worth my time besides quest rewards has always been a tradition for me.

Haha

With only rank 10 gear I think rogues wreck every other class. That's because classes like Warlock and Warriors need better gear, especially the Warrior with rank 14 weapon.
---
Because everyone else is just playing the game (everyone is excited for it). If they encounter a bug, they'll report it. But not many people are going out of there way to test backstab angles, or see if macros that shouldn't work in 1.12 do, or whatever. Its minutia that most people don't want to do in general, but also something that most of their viewers don't want to see at all.
---
As much as I dislike those addons that put rating on other players, the current mmo-rpg community has adapted to it.
---
Also, since the strategy for all Classic instanced content is already known, the community will naturally trend towards its usual speedrunning nature, knowing all the quickiest routes.
---
As such, for those players, addons to "easily exclude people from groups" is sadly inevitable *unless* the majority of player manage to be part of a healthy guild community.

---
I'll note it and maybe make it if I'm bored with nothing else to do.
---
Just like in retail? I have added way more people in retail than I did in vanilla. There were only a handful of people worth adding in vanilla on my server, now I have the entire US.
---
I don‚Äôt understand people that think this aspect is gone. If you are friendly and play well and actually play dungeons you will get plenty of friends. 
---
I honestly think this is more of unfounded myth due to people‚Äôs lack of interpersonal skills nowadays....
---
I don't know. Soda was in that run with Tips, and saw a lot of bad plays. Maybe he's just goofing, but he probably could have healed through the damage if he wasn't DPSing and constantly canceling his casts for some reason.
---
Yeah I still had groups that would dominate the boat from Wetlands to Darnassus for entire weekends well after BG's released. 
---
Typically started slow and ganky but would develop into complete chaos and sometimes morph into coordinated raid parties duking it out for hours. 
---
I played on a couple RPPvP servers specifically because the world PvP was so good. BG's added options, it didn't reduce them. Unless you were on a low-pop / dying server, but that's the way she goes sometimes.
---
laughing my butt off at work holy shit
---
Good lord, that's seriously cringeworthy.
---
I started June 2005 so I wasn't first wave of players but definitely had  a year and a half of vanilla left at that point.
---
Thanks haha
---
Anybody know if it's possible to check if you've gotten into the closed beta via the Blizzard site, not the launcher?
---
&gt;It's funny how things turned out. I remember we got made fun of back in Vanilla because WoW was considered an easy mode MMORPG back then. 
---
well...it was. WoW vanilla really killed MMO's as they were before quest hubs, quest markers, loss of negative progression.  
---
Everquest questing was something like this:  
---
&gt;you target NPC  
---
&gt;type: /hail  
---
&gt;NPC responds in chat box: hail player! watch out for the \[orcs\] down the road!  
---
&gt;you type: what orcs?  
---
&gt;NPC responds in chat box: Those orcs that belong to the \[Crushbone\] Clan. They are deadly.  
---
&gt;you type: where is crushbone?  
---
NPC: Crushbone is their camp, find me some Crushbone belts and I will reward you
---
Everquest and all other MMO's up until WoW featured loss of exp on death, and player corpse rot. Depending on your level. If you died and didn't loot the gear off your body. It would vanish from the game with all your loot on it. You could grind for hours. level up. die once and loss all the exp and the level. The one thing that set WoW apart from the rest, was the seamless zoning. That was groundbreaking at the time..and kind of still is.
---
Do you not have the capacity to pay attention to a 40 second video?

&gt; hope to get an inv soon!

VC was absolutely used back in the day, my friends still call it that and none of them ever played pservers.
---
Ya, SW_Stats had a similar look as well.
---
Classic won‚Äôt be like your private server
---
Classic has actual blizzard backup data logs
---
Not made up numbers
---
Yes we would be. Nostralius just happened at the same time the US Copyright Office changed its rules on older versions of MMOs that are no longer legal to play. Classic was a business decision. Not a bunch of fanboys crying about how easy WoD was.
---
Again, just clueless.
---
I liked WoD. More than Pandas.
---
umm.. you potted too..
---
You're getting a shit ton of feedback from people who are trying to draw experience when they don't have any.  Rogues are fine, play whatever the hell you want.  I played through the entirety of vanilla, both classes were well represented.  No one said "shit, you're a rogue, I can't bring you to my scholo group" especially since at first we were raiding scholo, strat, and UBRS.
---
They're very different classes, play whatever you think sounds more fun, don't waste time getting caught up in one being "out-classed" by the other, that's retarded.
---
PS: Rogues were the most represented class in all of Vanilla
---
I think each expansion has it's good pieces. MoP was peak class design imo. WoD was the first real mythic raid expac, legion brought M+.
---
Nah I played a little in vanilla, and private servers. People will and are going to get lost in WC and jumping mechanics are silly and weird. That's not why he, or soda, half mana, dpsing boss ignoring any healing spells on essentially the last boss, are bad. Its because they are just trash 2.0 when vanilla launches these people wont be relevant anymore. They are just cocky and recognizable people
---
There's also a guide somewhere that I saw for getting to level 5 solely on Discovery. Obviously it takes longer than questing/killing but it's fast enough that it can beat the over crowded starting areas.
---
Unconventional strategies like this become relevant when launch day rushes are involved.
---
VC was used when I was playing on Mannoroth(US) in Vanilla... circa 2005 after Dire Maul became a thing.
---
&gt;this calendar didn't help to impress our female colleagues
---
They'll be impressed when they see you with that beautiful full t1 set ;) .

Your going to be waiting and sometimes you‚Äôll be the person making others wait. Takes time to travel sub 40. Afterwards it takes slightly less time to travel but still requires people to run. Or you can play a lock and hope you have two fast people to meet you and summon the slowpokes.
---
honestly i don‚Äôt care at all about the beta... but my gambling addiction is scratchin at me now that i can fork over 15 dollars and see if i roll big. i‚Äôm gonna do it. will report back.
---
&gt; Scaling is great in giving you more area options
---
...And undermines this completely by making every combat encounter everywhere feel the exact same.
---
I'd do it. The traveling isn't a huge issue in my experiences due to Ghost Wolf. You don't *need* the water totems for leveling that early on, or possibly ever, but I quite liked having Mana Spring totem while leveling. If you get to an area where you can pull the mobs you're killing to a central location, it's a lot of mana return off of a single cast. Additionally, you may want to take a break from solo questing, and do a dungeon or two. Mana spring is quite useful in dungeon groups.
---
Haha! Right?
---
Never used it or saw it even after Dire Maul came out. Most of us that were release day players knew better I guess.
---
This is untrue and has been debunked more than once by official sources. Ythisens himself said that the moderator team found out 7 months before the official public announcement (which wasn't terrible long after the Nostalrius visit to HQ). 
---
He says that the team had already been working on it for a year before they told the other teams, which means that Classic development started at least 19 months before it was officially announced in November 2017. That puts development starting sometime Feb-April 2015, which was when Nost was barely getting started.

Are you actually going to be upset that chat isn't #nochanges?
---
I was horde on Twisting Nether too.  Alliance definitely RPd more.  They used to always RP in gold shire and one of the taverns in the back of Stormwind.  I used to join them on my undead rogue - especially since there were no NPCs in the tavern
---
Will this sub be as spammed with streamer content all the time at launch as it is now? Nothing against streamers, just curious.
---
account from 2005, played solid through the first few expansions and have been on and off again since. Reactivated a week before the beta announcement in hopes of it happening. No invite yet, but I'm running on a potato masquerading as a laptop until my new machine gets here in 2 weeks.
---
Started getting into some of the BR games lately, and it was pretty sad for me. Thankfully I got significantly better when I updated from my potato PC, but I'm still not nearly as good as I remember being in Battlefield 1942. These games have changed, upped their difficulty, and I of course can't put in the same practice hours anymore. It's crazy to be at the bottom of a skill curve, at least in terms of action games. I was a big idiot when playing strategy games back then though, and much better now so I take solace in that.
---
Well Monkeynews just kite the mobs with hamstring anyway. Not really comparable to not repairing your gear when you are the friggin tank lol.
---
I really hope they do. Some rebalancing is really needed, especially for druids, paladins and shamans.

Agreed. I always liked Esfand in particular. Doesn't take himself seriously and is often hilarious.
---
Great post. I never RP'd (unless I was super drunk / high but in those cases I probably was black out and have no memory of such acts) but I will say, RPPvP servers had some of the best world PvP around. I used to live on the Wetlands boat, fearing / MC'ing fools off the boat right before the loading screen. Yeah... That's a minumum of 2 ghost runs back due to dieing from fatigue. 
---
Good times... Good times...
---
Only some actually do and most will quit within a month of launch. People easily forget all the bad shit and see things with nostalgia rose tinted glasses. JAB was right and people will see soon.

I saw it. Thrall kicked over the BFA stump, picked up a vanilla weapon. While Saurfang told him BFA looks good, but it's wrong, broken. GG
---
Its something people say to themselves or others to explain why they lost. That's about it. Everyone pots tho. Honestly I'd feel pretty good about getting ganked at like 30% health and still making my attacker have to pot. 
---
A lot of people just run for whatever reason, even though their death is inevitable. I don't get that.
---
Even if holy, while leveling, you are a melee class.
---
Ight lol
---
sooo dumbass healer used half his mana for 2 shots of dps, let his tank die, then freaked out and didnt know what to do.. fucking "pro" players here
---
I didn't see anything under account settings or subscription. Seems to all just be under the normal wow stuff. 
---
I just saw it where you select live or ptr, and there was an option for classic beta.
---
That's rough, buddy
---
I can definitely see where /u/zvh1Ibzw1dyCi is coming from. I can't play without WAs. I've got so many auras that pop up exactly when I want them to, with the effect I want them to and sometimes with the sound I want them to. I've really thought my auras through and through and I can't give you any examples right now because I don't remember them. I know they do what I need them to do and I take actions based on that information that pops up on my screen. So yes, the automation that comes with WAs is huge. For example: When I played some 2s with a friend, he made a call to kite the enemy warrior because he popped cooldowns. I didn't even realise! I naively ask him after the match how did he know and he says he just saw his character. And all along I was like "shit I need to make a WA for this." 
---
That said, /u/WrennFarash takes it to the extreme. Yes, that's what your eyes are for but you've obviously never gotten into any challenging enough content to need WAs. Taking your mind off of basic stuff like rotational spells, CDs, procs, certain boss mechanics, etc. is a MASSIVE bonus to your awareness and adaptability in any fight, at least in PvE where I do have experience. Moment-to-moment decision-making is very important in retail and the convenience of icons telling you when you can refresh your dots to take full advantage of pandemic instead of thinking whether the window was 6s or 4s is too much.
---
I asked in the discord of the last guild I raided with if anyone was playing classic. The reaction was "lol nope."
---
I don't get it.
---
There's addons at least for the 1.12 client that will sort it this way. But the AH still has to scan every Auction so its slow as sin.
---
Don't use it then.
---
Lol. Yeah me too. That's why I said it. But I think it's clear Classic will NOT be Vanilla exactly. We know that as a fact. Feel free to come back to this in a year when Ion does a video explaining why they are doing a balance pass with classes ... OR when it doesn't happen and you can neener-neener me. I don't mind being wrong on a forum designed specifically to talk about these sorts of things.
---
Indeed, I‚Äôll take quality over quantity for sure!

---
Then how come this video show more or less the same as the Beta?
---
And Cata. That was wank
---
Once you get to about lvl 17 you can heal dungeons mostly to 60. It will be slow, but I prefer leveling this way.
---
\+1 for RPPvP realms!
---
I don't give a shit what Blizzard claimed about their time line.  They didn't give the idea any consideration until they saw what happened with Nost.
---
Right, Blizzard eliminated the entire old Addon framework because of rampant exploitability. No one ever expected those APIs to return.
---
If you want to level as a holy caster, priest with some Shadow talents in spirit tap/wand is the way to go.
---
omg lmao holy fuck
---
I hate grinding endless mobs, so I wanted to show what I do to make gold because I am weird and enjoy fishing. Classic will have different catch rates than what we've been use to for the last few years, so doing this as gold/hr wouldn't be accurate. Instead I shared the amount that I usually see these fish and items selling for over the years. Hope this helps some folks out as they level up in Classic, and especially the more casual player who might be a bit lost on how to make gold.

Holy shit dude, thanks a lot. I was trying to find this information and even blue posts said it wasn't possible.
---
No, Scriptcraft was a server, twice actually. But it was basically run by one guy, and he couldn't run it by himself. When it shut down the second time he published his database and a ton of other pservers used it, which is probably why you might have only known of it as a database.
---
Mangos I'm not sure.
---
1 moonfire and hard casting wrath IIRC. But yes Tips also put no effort into mitigating damage.
---
Nost was incredible for me. The lag sometimes was awful, but on that last day, everyone on their mounts in Ironforge.... Hadn't felt community like that in ages in WoW. You got to know people on your server, group with them, seeing people in epics was EPIC! Even when the nostalgia didn't carry the game, playing an MMORPG again that was challenging was refreshing.
---
I was very sad to see it go but I agree I really think it pushed Blizzard to do Classic. Moreso than the other pservers. I'm very excited for August, already planning out my main!
---
Do you know what sarcasm is mister OP ?
---
That's such a dumb comparison to make, for multiple reasons.
---
where did you get that map?
---
I looked it up but couldn't find anything older than from Cata times.
---
Your dmg is going to be less than other Paladins, but the good news is that you can actually tank a lot of low level dungeons if you want because you'll have consecrates and it's amazing for threat generation.
---
Had to google what Nostalrius was, a private server? like wut.
---
I suppose kids and teenagers wouldn't be here if no private servers but anyone around 19-20 could of played vanilla wow.
---
No luck today, but maybe someday.

Holy shit you guys hate fun and jokes around here. What's with the classics community having a massive stick lodged so deep in their asses? Lighten the hell up.

This is the same as Final fantasy 7 remake, there isn't private FF7 servers, yet there is an obvious love for the game so it was finally made.

No private servers would of meant very little, maybe a slower rate of classic wow coming back? if that.

What? There wasn't any transgender stuff in what I said. Did I miss something? Make a female undead then.

This is so wildly incorrect it‚Äôs crazy. What stats are telling you that no servers 15 years ago called ot VC? From my experience in retail vanilla on the server Azgalor we exclusively called it VC.

Only if your job title is "streamer". How can you hope to compete with someone who can spend 14-16 hours a day grinding? I suggest you calibrate your goals to something more realistic. I'm perfectly okay with progressing at a slower rate than hardcore players, given I simply don't have time to keep up. There will be plenty of people in your situation, meaning you can still find someone to raid with, albeit at a slower pace.

1.12.2006 :D I remember being so pleasantly surprised suddenly getting a free respec (when the pre-tbc patch came) since i had spread my talents between all 3 trees levels 10-2X.
---
The joys of remaining childless. Lol
---
Trust me your fine.
---
Trump 2020
---
I level as a Prot Warrior, so I'm right there with you. Actually, you got it much worse. Just find folks to level in dungeons with and you'll be fine.
---
Do i need to reset raid or just dc inside?
---
I just said I would answer questions when I woke up!
---
If true, how did they not remove this? It's not a bug it's just not even noticing or forgetting about it.
---
Can you show screen shot for ptr? I want to see how it looks like.
---
This is exactly why people will quit classic as well. Too much grind.
---
Yes!
---
Isnt that the skada map tooltip, not recount?
---
Ah, ye, mangos is a core for sure, wasn't entirely sure where scriptcraft originated from tho.
---
I reactivated this morning, when I downloaded the launcher it was there. So....not sure how that works.
---
Thanks! I don't see myself getting higher than R10. Is a warrior not a good choice at this level of dedication? For reference, my current choices are warrior or rogue for melee. Then if I want ranged, I'll look into mage or Hunter.
---
Priorities when it comes to removing stuff I guess
---
How do you know that? i dont think mouseover macros were even in Vanilla..
---
Much better quality than the other ones. Well done
---
Oh yea forgot that was WoD. I absolutely loved that spec
---
YES.

Man, jealous. I had a 3 day weekend already so this would have been perfect. Fingers crossed.
---
Congrats.
---
That's sick. Was he active in the Second War or was he still young?
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works
---
i contacted blizz support. They said it's random. I have 4 accounts. 2 from 2005. one is currently active with sub for last few months. They said it wouldn't be worth it resubbing the older accounts. Because they all tied to my bnet account anyways.
---
As someone who won‚Äôt be able to dedicate to a raid schedule my plan is to go after the pre bis gear from dungeons. I went back this morning and played through all of Blackrock Mountain and had a great time doing it. Can‚Äôt wait to get in there on classic servers again
---
This sub is terrible man, you can do well in classic doing the minimum. Classic was the most accessible time to play WoW for casuals.
---
If anyone wants to be good at 1v1 pvp go rogue***
---
Rogue faces issues once you get into bgs, especially organized with organized teams
---
What the fuck, how was this post removed as a low-effort meme, but https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bppn9f/excusme_wtf_og/ is allowed to stay up?
---
Got to have that alliance vs horde battle every so often with all the RP soldiers :D
---
I don't
---
That's what I figured. Guess I'll play it be ear and see just how painful it is.
---
Honestly, a bit easier than I remember but I haven't leveled a mage since Vanilla. I felt like regen was higher and I also took elemental precision (hit talent) so I could kill orange mobs a lot easier. This was also the first time I legitimately used AoE leveling which obviously made the levels after 22 pretty fast and reliable without questing or inefficient travel.
---
Naysayers wont be wrong though. Many people will quit after a month and many people will stay. It is what it is.
---
idm man i started playing vanilla after Naxx was released and i still was main tanking MC before TBC launched
---
u have to contact CS and ask them. they can give you an exact date and time. they said it's random
---
Comes down to how you define competitively. World firsts? Constantly on the newest content? Rank 14? Probably not.
---
Can you get to 60 in a couple months, join a raiding guild, get enough gold for your consumables/BiS/enchants etc., yeah, probably. 
---
There's going to be plenty of people playing while working full time (myself included); It's definitely going to be harder than when I could take summer vacation just going hard in TBC but I'm not too worried about it.
---
Understandable. I'm probably just overthinking stuff but I'm just worried purely about the fact I want to raid but I work weekends so I think it's going to be difficult for me especially if I do want to play competitively despite having a job.
---
Classic is obviously going to be huge.  Look at the appetite to watch streamers run frickin‚Äô Deadmines on the beta.  It‚Äôs silly for Ion to withhold RP-PvP until after launch.
---
They are only pretending to be retarded....
---

---
Funny how I played a Warrior my entire until I realized Healing was my true calling. 
---
Switched right when Warriors became OP. /slowclap
---
I think frost mage and hunter would still beat rogue with r10 gear. I know as a paladin I probably would too, depending on how cheesy things get.
---
Can‚Äôt find an answer to wether or not you need BfA tho
---
Yep, first xpac I was subbed to for 80% of the time since WotLK, played about 2-3 months of BFA.
---
Thanks! Gonna go visit my local gamestop later and ask about it.
---
 Always VC
---
Because they pretend to know more than they actually do, and people will believe just about anything without a shred of proof as long as it's what they want to believe. This subreddit is no exception.
---
Thank you for explaining this for me lol
---
I doubt not being able to raid on weekends will be an issue. I've been an on and off raider since vanilla and finding guilds to raid with on weeknights instead of weekends was always pretty simple since people usually go out on weekends and stay in on work nights.
---
Hi, /u/Carterise
---
&gt; Had to google what Nostalrius was
---
Are you under a rock? How did you even get here?
---
There's always going to be this "real vanilla players -vs- vanilla pserver players" thing.
---
He says a lot of crap to get chat riled up - went on multiple rants before Deadmines "why would I ever need defensive stance? like why would I ever use that" but it was just a long troll.
---
Its because having people on your friends list was essential in vanilla, since you would always need to form groups by chat. So knowing people made it easier to form groups and have reliable people.
---
In retail you just click a button and are transported to a dungeon with a group. No need to have reliable people who don't leave or spam trade chat in a capital.
---
Taurens are so fat, if they'd jump in the air, they'd get stuck.
---
&gt;How much of a PITA will this be? I have no desire to play ret because melee classes generally don't appeal to me (I've always been a caster)
---
You'll have 1 10 yard spell you can use once every 8 or 10 seconds. Holy isn't a caster, it's still 95% melee.
---
You used your brain for two seconds. Prepare for all the down votes!
---
All that work got done for legion though when they converted the whole game over to that method and considering Classic uses the same client and server stuff combined with their desire to not have it feel like running two different MMOs completely they would want to overlap their stuff as much as possible. 
---
They had heaps of bugs with their scaling system in legion and while that part of it is probably turned off, there could still be underlying bugs that haven't popped up when the scaling is turned off because it's always on in the modern game.
---
Oh shit what up. Wubdor here.
---
Ugh, you know what sucks is that people called that too. A lot of people have been worried that right-click report will be bad in vanilla. There were a lot of nay-sayers... sounds like it may already be a problem.
---
You could end people in a soul fire shadow burn combo. I loved destro!
---
If I was you I‚Äôd just play the shit out of the stress test and hope they let you stay in after seeing how long you played that for. At least that was my plan before I randomly got in lol. Either way, fingers crossed for you too brotha!
---
My Wow life in a nutshell
---
I'm gonna be trying to raid and progress my character while having a job. It's totally possible but you'll probably have to focus on being more efficient and making good use of your time. I plan on playing a priest as my main, I'm gonna dual box with a mage. Anytime I have downtime on my priest I'm gonna be having my mage farm for me, it will definitely add up. I'll also have the benefit of being able to port my priest around instantly anytime I need as well. Even doing that I'm not gonna be able to join a guild that raids four nights a week. So I don't know about being "competitive" but I think that everyone that can schedule a night or two a week for raiding can see a large portion of the end game.
---
I mean I used Titanbars and only faintly remember having heard the name cosmos. Wouldn't blame anyone for not knowing it. But going full on "lolz i was in classic and i don't know this so it must be non-classic so I gotta rub my classic-superiority into everyone's face" was totally uncalled for and ultimately makes him look like a total tool. I mean what's the point of doing that even if he were right about it not being a classic thing?
---
Yup...  a beta test for a game this size should start a year ago... this is more of a pre-release test.
---
I actually noticed this when watching streams earlier but assumed I was mistaken.
---
Pretty sure the orange one was the chaser I had with my first shot of alcohol. Game fuel and SoCo. Memories.
---
Depends on what you mean by "competitively". As long as you can play on a schedule you can raid.
---
I leveled as fire until 22. At that level, especially new fireball skill levels (12, 18) you absolutely blow mobs up and drinking/regen is so fast downtime isn't too bad. 
---
Once I got level 22 I respecced into a Blizzard AoE build and leveled from 22-26 purely with AoE grinding at different spots (22-23 at the Westfall Gnolls, 23-25 at the Wetlands gnolls, and 25-26 at the Redridge Gnolls). I definitely AoE grinding a decent amount from 26-30 too, mainly at the Raven Hill graveyard, but I did all of the Wetlands and Darkshire quests as well because they give really good experience. I had plans to go to STV and do the beginning Kurzen/hunter camp quests if I needed to.
---
Well, since you level as a melee, taking holy talents or healing gear will not help you at all.
---
If your goal is to play pve healing at 60, I would recommend leveling up as fast as possible, which is playing as ret.
---
If your goal is to try healing while leveling, then you can try it, but it is slower to solo, and in groups you are at the mercy of other people who were slow to level for whatever reason. Myself being more experienced, I find myself more comfortable grouping with other experienced players who tend to level more quickly, although this is just a generalization.
---
Most of leveling just depends on the amount of time you put in, so you could still level pretty fast if you are very dedicated.
---
Noggenfogger shapeshifts you, deviate delight costumes you.
---
That‚Äôs not at all how higher mythic +‚Äôs work..
---
Why don't you just do it?
---
2/4/2005 here get on my level.
---
In Legion dungeons also felt so easy I could just autowalk through them spamming swipe. Didn't really need anyone else. Can push mythic+ but I'm not really into speedrunning the same things over and over.
---
You're going to have to link to your original post, I haven't a clue what you're talking about it.
---
As cynical as I am about today's Blizzard, they gain nothing by lying about this.
---
I had a guild get force name-changed on an RPPVP server back in the day. RIP &lt;Candy Van&gt;
---
Yeah, I'm in.
---
Hahaha your story is mine exactly - though I leveled a hunter which was an absolute snoozefest. I've been playing classic throug a few private servers with friends and having a blast recently, all preparing for classic launch.
---
let them quit, who really cares? I know i‚Äôll be there 100% along with my friends from Vanilla. I also think there will be enough people to keep it going. 
---
I did a 1-60 run in the last few months just to get myself slightly prepared.
---
I can't really think of another MMO that has such a seamless world still. FFXIV, while IMO became the newest evolution of themepark MMOs, is zones everywhere. Are there any others like WoW where you can go from one corner of the continent to the other without a single loading screen?
---
Not having RP-PvP at launch just shows there are still ignorant voices overseeing Classic's development. They claim their primary goal is long term server population, yet don't see a downside of launching a new server type some undetermined time after launch potentially causing a population shift from existing rp/pvp servers. 
---
Not having at least one PvP/RP server per realm is just plain stupid.
---
I mean, why do you care what other people use? You're entire statement, "People want to play vanilla, they need to play vanilla. Best part of the game is that there isn't all this bullshit sparkling objectives and mapped out locations showing you everything." is entirely an opinion and does not reflect the feelings of everyone.
---
If you want to play a more classic experience with no add-ons, go for it. If someone else maybe doesn't have as much time to dedicate to the game or enjoys an add-on, fine by me.  
---
You'll find yourself a lot happier if you stop worrying what other people are doing and just focus on what makes you enjoy the game.
---
Keep in mind that AoE grinding at low levels requires very specific spots that I am sure will be camped on release. You have to have large groups of mobs that don't have any casters/ranged shooting mobs in them.
---
Yeah, paladins are hard to play in vanilla. I also rolled a paladin on nost, but i got tired of it at lvl 15
---
This x2. You really felt like you earned the levels in vanilla. There was no blood DK to pull half the map and nuke them down lol
---
I don't remember the servers being down for whole days. They were problematic, but half the time I was only out for 8 hours. So I always came up in the end, generally.
---
You can sap a hunter who is standing I  the middle of his flair. And crippling keeps you in the dead zone effectively. 
---
The only things that might not allow you to win 80% of the time are imp wingclip or conc shot procs.
---
Do what you want but it is gonna bore the everliving fuck out of you like 20 levels in tops. Props if you make it past 30 without putting bullet in your head from boredom
---
You're literally responding to it...
---
I said I was going to sleep in the original post!
---
I‚Äôll do that tonight! At work right now. Feelsbadman
---
Then out of curiosity why not level ret and just switch holy later since you'll be essentially Auto attacking your way to 60 anyway. Even in ret you should be able to heal dungeons competently while leveling.  In the long run ret will make it a bit easier to level but for a while leveling as holy wont make a difference easier until you start getting into really beneficial talents.
---
When ythisens got fired and was doing the rounds of youtube/podcasts he talks about when he was officially informed of it, and there had been a lot of around the office talk of it being worked on before that. This ended up being around 6 months before the shutdown iirc
---
My biggest respect to Nostalrius. I miss their servers
---
I feel sorry for the devs, the playerbase seems incredibly divided on all sorts of things. I had a glance and it's impossible to get any kind of consensus there. Some are okay with mild changes, some hate changes, some want MORE changes, some want less but want to keep a few.
---
(Also I do quietly want HD models, we already have all the other 2019 graphical features and updates so they may as well go all the way and provide the option for classic but in a new coat of paint. But every time it's suggested somehow people take it to mean I want them to also add LFR and Death Knights, which is absurd. I just don't want my tauren to have shovel hands man...)
---
Competitively as in I love PvP but I heard back in vanilla to PvP efficiently gear wise it will require PvE items which means raiding and such.
---
I was in a discussion with a friend about this last night. He is iffy about playing classic because he has the mindset of "I have already done this, why am I doing it again?". My argument is that while retail may be new and offer new things it's just not an MMORPG to me. 
---
I log in and join a lobby for gear that only the ILVL matters until it's the highest I can get. People don't remember me, I don't remember them. Getting gear doesn't matter in any way other than its numbers are higher. I don't know a single name of my pieces or their source. 
---
TLDR: I look forward to the sense of community and actually interacting with people. Huzzah Classic!
---
Describe the mechanism or its a fallacy.
---
How are you so retarded to say something like ‚Äú10 seconds‚Äù he stats off at like 90% and immediately gets hit to 60 while soda was still looting and at 50% mana, is just about 3 seconds for the boss to hit again and that kills him to 0% with some amount of overkill. Obviously you precast heals, but healer wasn‚Äôt ready and he just charged in without saying a single word. Omtop of that you‚Äôre not suppose to have broken armor and tips should have had shield block on his bar.  I would say there‚Äôs way more blame on the tank with how much he did wrong, soda just wasn‚Äôt expecting that damage which is fair since he hasn‚Äôt done that boss in years.
---
I was hoping there'd be one. While I'm not going to main there, I love the atmosphere of rp-pvp servers. I started on The Venture Co (US) and while my guilds (&lt;Exiled&gt;, &lt;Of the Whale&gt;, &lt;Subterfuge&gt;, &lt;Ozymandias&gt;) weren't fully RP there were some fun times to be had. Especially the fights and RP fights over the summoning stone in TBC.
---
Oh sorry, I thought this was modmail. They're completely different posts, I've no idea what more to say. Take it to modmail if you'd like a second opinion.
---
Those adding exist due to poor cross realm design. You won‚Äôt have cross realm. Realm reputation gets around better than any addon.
---
Then he could wear it with pride knowing he is right. LUL

Does anyone know roughly how many people are allowed in the beta, are there a lot of servers? (I suppose layering might already be on though)

Druids and Paladins are healers, you can make an argument for **one** shadow priest in a raid.
---
Did you AoE farm the orcs in the farms in Arathi Highlands? That's how I leveled my mage in vanilla.
---
This is way too witch-hunty. Post removed (Rule #3).
---
Which is why WoW succeeded. You hear horror stories about people grinding hours a night for a week just to gain a single level so they could move to a new zone. And then someone ten levels higher walks through, kills them, and steals their stuff. All that time and effort just gone.
---
You are wrong, the balance scene is in episode 2, not 1.
---
They let all of the douchebag streamers into the beta but the all of the content creators that are  helpful and don‚Äôt breed unnecessary hype seemingly we‚Äôre left out.
---
The same people tried telling us that we don't really want this.  We're not talking about the Blizzard that made Vanilla WoW.  Those people are long gone.  These people didn't like the idea of classic servers because it devalues the game they changed it to.
---
I'm willing to bet that it was their Activision overlords that pulled the trigger on this one.  Anything to boost the subcount.
---
&gt;  I've no idea what more to say. 
---
How about a reason why a well thought out post that baits you into thinking he's serious only to discover he's meming is considered low effort but putting a line of text on a picture is not?
---
You can start PvPing in any gear you have, full BIS is NOT a must as nobody had it back in the day and still did fine. You wont make Grand Marshal/High Warlord, but you can still have fun.
---
&gt; you can make an argument for **one** shadow priest in a raid. 
---
If there is warlocks haha
---
It's random, but only to some extend, it's pretty clear that they still give priority to older accounts. An old account doesn't guarantee an invite, it just increases the likelihood of it.
---
If you ever watched a serious duel tournament not just crit montages you know that the most ridiculous class is SL warlock and that most classes actually can beat a rogue if played correctly
---
whatever you want to think.
---
thanks!
---
Thank you.  Also everyone else apparently hasn't been let down by blizzard in the past 10 years.  Everything is going to be fine.  Don't worry, they reference the old data.
---
I've always loved speed running/leveling games. It started with diablo 2 ladder rushing and moved into WoW. When they would release new Vanilla servers I almost always migrated over for the leveling rush. I actually was not planning on rushing the beta leveling but I was ahead pretty early on (I was first level 14 on Alliance even) and I just couldn't go to sleep with the lead so I canceled a few things on Thursday and finished it out!
---
Yeah 100% 
---
But if I get past those spots early enough on release :)
---
Modmail dude, my own opinion isn't likely to change, if another mod wants to over rule they're welcome to. That's why we ask for appeals to be sent to modmail.

I mean \*every\* beta has people who send false bug reports. I send stuff that's "I don't think it should work like this" in live betas and PTRs. Sometimes it doesn't hurt to send it, but ya a guy like this who professes a lot of knowledge about stuff should maybe know better than to report a bug every time he dies.

Classic isn't balanced, that's not a discussion it's a fact.  If you go into this crossing your fingers for balance tweaks to help your favorite class perform better then you're going to be really sad and disappointed.
---
Now I'm a Druid main.  I love the class and yet I still would never recommend it to a friend.  Does that mean Druids should be changed?  No, because I love the class and I shouldn't ever have to worry about what the majority thinks my class should and shouldn't be able to do.  This isn't flavor of the month simulator like TBC forward was.  I think every player in Classic for it's entire existence should be able to log in and not have to be concerned about reading patch notes.

If you want an idea on how which class will be good and stuff, go on youtube. There's a lot of good youtubers that will give you all these informations. 
---
Kargoz is pretty good at explaining things, check him out.
---
just a job: yes. job/kids: not likely.
---
The struggle! üòÖ
---
Unless you're a caster and have a mob you just killed spawn on top of you as you're drinking.
---
Well none of them is definitively better than the other, some prefer more viability and other more damage but once you get good at dodging you don't need much more parry since you won't get much in melee range.
---
It increases all damage by 3%, a flat 3% damage increase, this is huge + you get 3% more damage on crit so 183% damage instead of 180% on crit.
---
Try it yourself, if you're getting pwned by melee go for deflection.
---
He's not even streaming right now? 
---
is there a collective group just bent on throwing shade at Tips?
---
Hes a good guy
---
The horde game fuel is the best Mt dew flavor hands down.
---
That must be why private server mages all go fire in AQ. No mana to spam Fireball.
---
You can make things work sure, but the community perception will be that druids/paladins/priests/shamans heal, hunters/mages/rogues/warlocks DPS and warriors can both tank and DPS.
---
If you want to have a more pleasant experience and not struggle with finding groups that's what you should adjust to. Community perception will always win over facts and numbers.
---
Hey, sorry about that.  What is his username though?  I'm just here for the popcorn, not trying to witch Hunt.
---
Sorry and thanks!
---
They're too busy stroking their own fragile egos to know what sarcasm is.
---
I get what you're saying but no one would ever become a big streamer if everyone thought that way, they had to earn that fan base to get there in the first place. 
---
Even big streamers are paying a ton in taxes, essentially the more money they make the more they pay in taxes.
---
I personally loved cata, quit for MOP and WoD, enjoyed legion. Wod and bfa are trash tho bad luck
---
I started day 1 for EU, earliest I could get
---
competitive more in the sense of being able to obtain good items to actually be able to to  have the satisfaction of destroying other players and brag about items other may not have.
---
But working 4 days a week I feel like my time will only be spent trying get items people already have and I won't ever progress in the sense of being 'better' than other players.
---
I am actually OK with that "beta for streamers" thing for different reasons.
---
They started the movement that got blizzard to change their mind about making classic. After they got shut down they gathered almost 300k signatures and  got flown out to blizzard HQ. We most likely wouldn't have classic if it wasn't due to the popularity of the server and the aftermath. Blizzard was very set on not making classic for the longest time, they didn't just change their mind out of the blue.

It‚Äôs been years. I‚Äôve been playing since beta for Vanilla in 04. I took a few breaks but it‚Äôs been active for a long time. It seems like there is a constant stream of people getting invites so I would keep checking your email. I have my fingers crossed for you!
---
TIL, thanks.
---
So why no response to this question?
---
I can't tell if this is a satire/troll post or if it's legitimate because I know there are 100% people like this, but 14-16 hours per day, god damn lol
---
I did not level a mage on private servers so it was all fresh. I leveled as fire until 22 because it does insane damage. Then I respecced into a Blizzard AoE build at level 22. I doubt I'll be able to do this on release because the AoE camps will be highly fought over and honestly the AoE build's questing/single targetting ability sucks. I plan to level as fire for release.
---
I don't have the software nor the skills. Its just an idea if somebody wants to do it for a laugh.
---
Want to know this as well. I don't have BFA and wondering if I could still get in
---
[This survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics) has about 20,000 responses and it looks like 6.9% want an RPPvP server and 2.1% want an RP server.
---
Asmong started in tbc hes clueless about vanilla
---
that tauren hit box is awful right now... There was someone who clipped tauren vs tauren duel and they were meleeing each other with \~6 yards between the character models.
---
You can‚Äôt sheep tagged mobs, that‚Äôs not a bug.
---
They are not in, they are hatin'.
---
I didn't mind it too much until i saw a video saying that the next attack ability is around level 40, and then nost got shut down so that was the end of that.
---
You could originally order it from the BradyGames website, back when they first released the guides. I bought it from eBay tho
---
ok.
---
i forget the name but there was the blue orb from outside dire maul that would shapeshift you into the opposite faction. so i remember looking like a horde character riding a night elf mount
---
this fucking sub honestly üòÇ
---
If you read the part of my comment you quoted, I specifically referred to 1v1 and not group pvp because that's where they were the most overpowered.
---
Even in group pvp, rogue are extremely strong if only because of their cc contribution to team fights. Rogues have always been part of the strongest group pvp combos. In 2v2, Mage + Rogue are instant wins vs almost any other combo in vanilla because the burst and cc is just unmanageable for almost any other combo. They can essentially shut out a player indefinitely and they can burst most players down almost instantly.
---
In 3v3's Mage Rogue and some other strong class is still the top combo. Again, for the same reason. Incredible cc and burst.
---
In 5v5's rogue's impact does get diminished, but you just can't undermine the utility of so much cc in a coordinated team. 
---
So I would say rogues lose their value the most in AV zergfests where rogues really can't contribute that much DPS vs a crowd, but outside of that, they are incredible in group pvp.
---
Honestly, I don't think I can think of a more powerful pvp class than rogue. They just destroy in almost all formats of pvp. Even geared warriors who starts dominating with good gear can't beat rogues consistently in 1v1 or 2v2. Especially not without resilience as a rogue mage will shred a warrior combo in vanilla.
---
There are currently 5 memes on the front page of this subreddit.
---
Yeah I only started Oct 2006, my chances are slim.
---
Everyone on beta seems to be a streamer or have an account since 2004/2005.
---
All i remember are the chuck norris jokes.
---
hard to decide for me where to put that silver. both the title and this comment are of quality.
---
Paladins are not hard to play in vanilla lol. You have so many "oh shit" abilities, even at lower levels. You can heal, bubble, LoH, a stun, etc and killing things was just slightly harder than simply auto attacking.
---
Just playing WoW for the first time can be hard, but I think Pally is probably one of the easiest, even for a noob, compared to the other classes except maybe hunter and warlock.
---
&gt; Different mobs give different xp
---
not quite. mobs give (45+5*Clevel) xp if you're the same level as them... bear, tiger, murloc, naga, it doesn't matter. Elites give 2x, and dungeon elites give 2.5x -
---
Absolutely criminal if Mad doesn't get an invite!
---
Yeah people have different definitions of easy. Sure you could do WC another 3 levels farther and buy some "of the bear" gear and you'd beat it. One of the main points of classic was the fact that most of the mechanics weren't hard, but putting the time and effort into correct gear, level, group comp, consumables, etc. make all the difference.
---
Wouldn't that only work the first week? After it drops once it exists on your raid/server and the method wouldnt work?
---
I didn't want to try the beta, keep things fresh.
---
But now I feel like confirming my class choice. I just caught myself checking my email at work. Feelskindagoodman
---
I really just said I don't care if people want to do that. But since we're hear allegedly having a Goddamn discussion, I thought I'd come in an opine.
---
No need to get so tense and offended. Play with whatever addons you can muster. I'm just bringing in the alternate viewpoint that addons aren't necessary and, especially in the case of quest addons, really diminish the experience IMO and people shouldn't feel obligated to go load up their interface if they're not pushing high-end content.
---
That's just, like, my opinion man. People just have their feelings on things and there's no "WHY DO YOU CARE" to it, we just do.
---
Sorry not everyone agrees with me. Do we talk about it or do we shout people the fuck down? I dunno, as toxic as the gaming community is, I should probably expect the latter.
---
I think more people will play priest on release. It is not great at leveling early especially without higher levels to provide really good wands. Warlock is just always underpopulated - not sure why. They are absolute powerhouses at 60 but maybe not at 30?
---
+1 for [Dirge]
---
Oh yeah totally agree, personally I just think things have moved on too much for people to go back to a game with the style that World of Warcraft had back then.
---
Do I think it'll be popular? Yes.
---
Do I think it'll beat BfA? No.
---
Do I think it'll require other expansions to stay alive, thus leading to the same problem once it gets far into something people don't like and then the where's classic question comes up again? Also yes.
---
WoW is too different per it's expansions, it really does reinvent it's self for some reason every few years, ditching all the content it had before had to the archives of transmog farming.
---
With how games currently are, every game gunning for your time, I'm willing to be that's why sub numbers and such for MMOS are dropping. If you want all those skins in x Battle Royale game, you really are putting in MMO lengths of time to get them, heck, remember when it was as easy as getting a few head shots on Call of Duty? Things are overly complicated and take too much time.
---
I don't really know, I'm interested, I just think it's going to be hard to balance both games. Suppose BfA being a login twice a week game is helpful now.
---
Did someone just say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Not if they play on a PVE server.
---
It depends on your goal.
---
If you want to just play casually, a dungeon here and there maybe a MC pug every now and then for fun. You can pretty much play what you want. 
---
If you want to do some serious raiding. Your guild will have an expected role for you.
---
Glad he's finaly exposed as the tool he is
---
I couldn't stand the game past WotLK.
---
Where can I read about that?
---
I think based on the responses you‚Äôve received we know how the community feels about your idea
---
I'm sure you put those garbage level 40 uniques to good use. 
---
I remember you saying in chat "oh my God, what are you doing?" as you picked up all my loot and left game. 
---
Shit... They need to bring back D2: LoD while they're at it.
---
Theres a version of recount working for beta apparently
---
You should have stopped earlier. Now we can blame you!
---
They literally told us that they had *just* started development and found it it was even possible right before they announced it at Blizzcon, and that that was the reason that they had nothing to show for a year afterward.
---
Hey dads deserve a break sometimes too. You dont work all those hours to provide for your family and raise your kids to not enjoy a little something for yourself.
---
Grats on beta man, enjoy it, you deserve it brother!
---
Go back to reality. I start a new job in June that I have to move for so I need to back on that train. My girlfriend understands but today I need to get back on helping her with moving logistics, etc.
---
On beta, I'll probably level tailoring and try to get some silk gear. Maybe do deadmines so I can do stockades later. But yeah, I'm not gonna be playing super aggressively as I did leveling!
---
...
---
It's from a fantastic movie by Richard Ayoade called The Double (2013).
---
You won't be rocking rank 14 weapons. You be on the fast track to full tier by leveling two characters and doing split-runs.
---
You can still play the bloody game at a top 5% capacity playing a 'casual 20 hours a week's.
---
yes sir!
---
&gt;So, soda was 23 lvl and for killing 22 lvl mobs he was getting 77 XP per kill before the entrance, and 96 XP per kill after they entered the dungeon.
---
77/2*2.5 = 96.25
---
Seems accurate that dungeon elites give 2.5x and normal elites give 2x
---
I wonder if he passed out after writing this post haha
---
No one cares about impressing children with shit opinions.
---
Big boy
---
Wait, did I need to put the /s for you guys?
---
B E T A üòÜ
---
How did you make these? Would love to make my discord picture this!
---
I mean, I love WC and all, but it's my side-piece next to Deadmines.
---
Black Mirror anyone? The "Nosedive" episode. Or even just look at what's going on in China. No way.
---
Why do you feel compelled to come here and defend retail in every thread?
---
Too early to say for sure.   I've been having more fun in the beta than I expected, but it could be because it's fresh and new again.
---
110-120 takes like 6 hours tho.
---
The content was fine, the problem was ‚ÄúWhat content?‚Äù
---
It still is lol. Go play Everquest p99 or Ultima Online and tell me that Vanilla WoW was hard mode lol.
---
I agree with this. The content that was there was great but after a month I was just logging in for gold rewards and to farm apexis crystals. Highmaul kept me going for a while but I just had enough. I heard the Blackrock Foundry was one of the greatest designed WoW raids though.
---
&gt; Tbf I had to Google what cosmos is, had never heard of it.
---
bruhhh ... Cosmos was Titan Panel before Titan Panel existed!
---
Can you test if cleaecasting can trigger on every moob or just once per cast ?:) ty in advance
---
Oh I'm sorry :(
---
I‚Äôd be more concerned with the long term. Like if you needed to get back in the job market and needed to explain a ten year lapse in employment.
---
I love this!  "Classic WoW was so easy."
---
"I died, must be a bug."
---
Can you link your streaming channel? I'd rather watch a speed runner than Asmongold.
---
People that will ultimately be progressing through MC at best are simply jealous of people that have the opportunity to do things like Scarab Lord or legendarirs.
---
Do you think mage will be the fastest leveling class with AoE farming? I know hunter holds the world record, just curious what you think.
---
"Classic WoW is so easy."
---
"I died.  Must be a bug."
---
The beta characters will be removed for the official launch right, like everyone gets set back to beginning on a new character?
---
&gt; Legit question, what does Weakaura do?
---
It goes ding when there's stuff.
---
If you want to dominate PvP in vanilla, go with the rogue. It's simplest and probably the best way to do well in almost all formats of pvp.
---
He was in Duskwood for a while from what I remember watching themechanic's stream
---
Absolutely. I think we all need to thank each other and ourselves as well for continuing to play the game and wanting to play. If it wasn't for all of us, the game would be nothing. So, thank you to everyone :)
---
Looking for leveling partner for classic.
---
I`m a guy from Sweden taking vaccation for classic and looking for a person to level with. I will play undead mage and will try to reach 60 rather fast. I will play around 14-16 hours per day until i reach level 60. This would mean we have to eat and sleep at the same hours. Think it will be faster playing as two, easier to stay awake and not getting ganked.
---
If anyone is intrested let me know and send me a PM.
---
You have my upvote sir
---
In the quiet words of the virgin mary... come again?
---
Most guilds don't raid weekends.
---
And black listing Ninja looters after some runs.
---
Not only did Nostralrius reacquaint many of us with the true and almost original Classic feeling of playing the game; it allowed us to create and maintain friendships with friends from other countries.  The EU's taught me, an American, some very different strategies than what my groups did on American servers.  Different strokes and strategies for different strokes -- but it was REFRESHING.
---
Nost also showed ALL of us how world PVP should be...  Not molasses-slowed movements in TM and SS during world PVP, but how to get 100+ players to fight over a dragon, how to fight for control of BRM, and how much damn FUN spontaneous PVP can and, hopefully, WILL BE.
---
We all owe you, Nost.  And we love you for it.  Nost developers put in some sick amounts of time so that many of us could actually ENJOY a game again.  Much props, much thanks, and much love to Nost.
---
You alright there, lil timmy? Hostile ASD child gonna reeeeee.
---
I'm fine with also some how knowing which PvP server is most mature and has no big streamers on horde
---
Man it's fine to have this opinion but pretending you played vanilla to compare the two is not cool
---
Go get those levels Playboy lol
---
Is there any love for addon developers?  [https://github.com/Ko0z/zUI](https://github.com/Ko0z/zUI) 
---
I'm ready to get working! &lt;3
---
You're deluded lmao.
---
10/10 fix.
---
11/10 would be making every race a lobster.
---
Oh, I've no idea Tips plays retail WoW. I thought he was mainly playing pservers.
---
Weird, there's multiple people claiming they didn't need a sub to get INTO the beta, just to actually play it. Weird lie but hey, who would lie for no reason on the internet, right? My guess is they were accidental.
---
Vanilla released in my 30s though...
---
Go get those levels playboy lol
---
And Vead Cines isn't a thing that exists.
---
VC = Boss within DM if you desperately want to use the acronym.
---
DM + cardinal direction/run type = Dire Maul, as noone runs a full clear of all the wings, at least without mentioning it when looking for people to join.
---
I think blizzard is better off catering retail to what retail players want. The two games are too different at this point, and I think that many retail players truly enjoy what it has become and would not enjoy Classic very much.
---
But for my own sake, I hope Blizzard can figure out the recipe of Classic and what made it so rewarding and fun to play and then create a new expansion or new content for the new Classic timeline.
---
They are expanding the pool of players for access slowly, so its possible that new invites are going out weeks.
---
This is a good video that I used for AoE spots.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKwcaBGIVI
---
I used the Westfall gnolls camps from 22-23 to practice. They are easy since the mobs at 16-18.
---
Wetlands camps in the South (Mongrels, Gnolls) from 23-25. They are faster leveling since they are higher level but one camp has a Mistweaver that constantly came out of polymorph early causing a lot of ruined pulls. 
---
I did Redridge Shadowhide from 25-26. I didn't like this spot very much because there are way too many patrols/stealth mobs that can wreck your pull. Also some of the mobs don't "run away" when they get low life which is actually really important for AoEing because you have low health/mana at the end and you need to finish off a few with wands. Definitely a more dangerous spot.
---
I AoEd off and on in Duskwood at both Raven Hill (skeletons and ghouls) and the Worgens. You get a new rank of blizzard 28 so I could reliably AoE down the level 29-31 Dark Runners/Vile Fangs/Tainted One worgens at that point. 
---
Health/mana regen seems about where it was in Vanilla. A full drink got me to about 80% mana when my conjured water spell was getting old.
---
The way Blizzard works is definitely probably buggy. I found that if you interrupted your cast of blizzard, the new cast would not start doing damage until the old cast "would have" finished. Therefore I pretty much always let blizzard fully cast even if a mob was about to get out. Once I figured it out it was easy to work around. Led to a few more scuffed pulls, though.
---
*laughs in 2004*
---
Yeah, it was sad that nost got shut down. What would you like to roll this time?
---
Thank you all for the quick replies. It's very much appreciated!
---
Gotcha, thanks! It‚Äôs super detailed!
---
Damn man whats up! Add my bnet idk if I still got you added on there. Brewer#1902
---
Thanks bro! And my mom tells me I am just healthy and big-boned ha
---
Holy shit OP I thought I was the only person who still to this day references ‚Äúwhy are you a troll priest‚Äù.
---
One of the most iconic Vanilla forum responses tbh. Can still remember scrolling through the forums cackling with laughter at it as a 13 year old. 
---
Yeah, I thought it was easy enough with just shadowbolts too, something along the lines of sedduce, run max distance, 1-2 shadowbolts, fear 1-2 shadowbolts, deathcoil, shadowbolts, shadow burn
---
Blizzard Europe but did not mention that it is mostly Na player at the moment. It will be nice to have a confirmation that Eu players can be picked and not only for stress tests.
---
i think layering and more rpg elements would serve retail well too. i don't think anyone enjoys the empty feel of current retail wow. higher capacity servers and layering would help a lot.
---
Honestly dont know alot about classic and i dont think im going to be raiding alot or anything hardcore, so i was think maybe a warlock since i dont play caster alot, either that or mage for them dank portals.
---
Dumbass. Rppvp fosters the best world pvp servers like emerald dream. Its nothing like moonguard wich is strictly rp.
---
So does this mean this weeks wave is over?
---
Interesting... I did when I wrote that
---
Limiting the beta to retail players is ludicrous.  Not just because they're making people pay them to test their product.  You can't find the mistakes if you don't know what mistakes to look for.
---
I will probably leveling some professions for now and try to do some dungeons and get some gear. Eventually I'll probably make a Horde on the PvE server and level that. Probably a shaman!
---
You can see the population difference [here](http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/), OSRS has around 100k while RS3 is sitting around 25k players.
---
This single screenshot personifies everything wrong with retail. Your name, your reputation, your whole identity went right out the window when all the servers were homogenized.
---
RP fishing guild here I come!  I really hope they add the PvP servers!
---
Of course they would become big. Just not so big they can own a Lamborgini and a Deloreon that they bought within a year of each other.
---
Me too, for more than one reason. This august 27 release just puts the cherry on top.
---
Theres a game called rock paper scissors. Usually one thing beats another thing, but loses to the left over thing. 
---
In 2005 people were saying that the game was balanced that way on purpose. This video makes fun of that and shows the "rock paper scissors" balancing is untrue. Adding warlocks as mushrooms is a joke wildcard that furher lampoons the simplistic "rock/paper/scissor" structure. 
---
What does mushroom beat? What does it lose to? No one knows, just like how people complained about warlocks being both OP and underpowered in Vanilla. No one knew for certain how to categorize them.
---
Stop coming back! You're ruining it for everyone!
---
The end-game was the only good thing about WoD imo. Those raids were really good. BRF in particular is one of my all-time favourite raids.
---
I don't get it either.
---
Ah didn't realize that was patched out in vanilla. Thanks
---
I will do worse on classic because there will be A LOT more people competing for mobs, especially early. I got ahead of the pack right out of the gate so the mobs at level 6+ were basically uncontested.
---
&gt;Back in 2004
---
Man time it's been 15 fucking years
---
I think he is referring to the fact the west is a dying civilization and you can watch it real time in birth rates. Seems pretty anti-social to talk about it here or fling mud at some random guy for it. Especially since he has no idea why you choose not to have kids.
---
Yeah, I was in school in '04.  Law school  :(
---
anal dirge
---
People meme over it but you can legitimately level while watching movies/TV shows, it's not the worst.  If you never did Vanilla that might not be appealing as you're not engaging with the content, but for some it's a plus as you can essentially grind/space out.
---
Yes! I leveled from 22 on with an AoE build, sprinkling in some Duskwood/wetlands quests from 26 onwards.
---
Never was specced into clearcasting to tell you. Sorry man.
---
I believe they will be keeping modern raid frames. The argument being that the originals were so bad that people immediately downloaded addons for frames anyway so why not just skip that step. 
---
For macros and addons I think their argument was that the Vanilla API was just too powerful. It didn‚Äôt matter as much back in 2004-06 but with 15 years of experience and sophistication developers could create things that were never intended to be in Vanilla.
---
Tips started in Cata, he never experienced proper Vanilla.
---
You have access to Google.
---
Found the private server baby.. Its okay buddy youll grow up some day
---
people on the internet getting butthurt over semantics what else is new
---
Depends on what you're expecting, if you're planning to go for say world first Naxx probably not.  If you're planning to eventually clear Naxx sure, after a couple years there's probably going to be a number of guilds clearing Naxx on a fairly casual schedule.
---
Yes Kevin, you do.    
---
It's just people wanting to show off their shiny stuff without putting any effort into it, the fact that retail wow a game with a subscription based model had an ingame store is telling enough about todays gaming community.
---
Weird how I‚Äôve gotten downvoted for saying this!!! When we already had multiple CS reps confirm this
---
im so fucking giddy
---
No? Was just making a statement
---
I bet they tell people that so it increases their chances slightly to get into the beta themselves.
---
7/05. Guess I wasn‚Äôt quite as OG as I thought
---
‚ÄúPretending?‚Äù  Here is an early vanilla video of my horde mage Nacilep. https://youtu.be/lLorhdpBEs8
---
Here is some stuff from BC to Cata https://www.youtube.com/user/Nacilep1
---
Here is my current Mage https://prod.worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/wyrmrest-accord/nacilep

Here is an alt rogue from vanilla https://prod.worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/thorium-brotherhood/pelican
---
Add me Nacilep#1263
---
Not sure what else I can do to prove it. Jesus.
---
Yeah I don't really care that much mate. As I said if someone wants to make it they can take the credit. It was just a fun idea.
---
These aren't the type of people Blizzard should have beta testing
---
true true
---
Wtf
---
completely useless. they do have rockbiter which increases threat but they aren't meant to be a true tank. warriors are the only true tank in vanilla.
---
Shaman can tank dungeons in a half assed kind of way. That‚Äôs about it.
---
Thank you Nostalrius. We had a long fight against Blizzard. The "youthinkyoudobutyoudont". The shutdown, the petition, Mark Kern, the meeting at Blizzard's HQ, the Blizzcon 2016 where nothing happened. The disarray. And finally the announcement.
---
Its all about the journey.
---
Pretty sure it's another guy. That's not Athene's voice or way of talking, and he would for sure have his face on the vid.
---
With no sit to proc in Classic, no eye of the storm free casts. This makes warstomp more useful. Tauren also have a greater melee range(perhaps too much). Tauren is looking like the superior race given that the pvp trinket already removes stuns.
---
At this point I'm wishing people would get into beta just so you have something else to do with your time than nitpick the streamers. This constant barrage of bashing posts gets really tiresome.
---
Oof someone is offended enjoy moonguard
---
Does sub mean the same thing as having game time or nah?
---
Okay, yeah you're right. They are just very slow, beacuse of their low damage. But I was actually very hard to die as a paladin, while leveling. And their "free" mount at lvl 40 is just a big bonus
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding your comment, but 2vs2/3vs3 and 5vs5 arenas weren't in vanilla.
---
There were a lot of minor bugs. Mainly to do with mob pathing/locations. There is a gnoll stuck in the mountain right by the Wetlands AoE spots that would aggro me and keep me stuck in combat sometimes. 
---
Blizzard (the ability) seems to be bugged in the fact that if you interrupt its cast to start a new one, the new cast does not start damaging until the old one would have finished. This affected my AoEing until I figured out what was going on.
---
I did not encounter any quest problems at all!
---
I can recommend reading the World of Warcraft Chronicles if you're interested in the WoW universe. The origin of Azeroth, other worlds, races and civilizations aren't always explained in-game and the chronicle books give you some insight on how and why some races turned out the way they are in-game.
---
Ret is viable in pvp and maybe casual dungeons and if you are in a social guild with friends maybe that, but anything cutting edge will need you to heal. For prot, you won't see much more from that talent tree ther than Blessing of Kings.
---
I have studied my magic crystal sphere and the answer is....... yes
---
No. Classic and BFA are both "World of Warcraft" and share a subscription. As far as we know there will not be any reduced cost options for players who only want one of them. It's the same subscription, you just get two versions of the game now.
---
There are other good community heads, dont be so harsh.
---
I'm a fan of meldaron and his brother. Also Kargoz is solid. I like them because they're just hyped for the game and aren't proclaiming to be the best. They're really just information aggregates if anything--whixh is good for someone like me who doesnt have time to search all the old forums and what not. 
---
Anyways, yeah tips apparently sucks and is kind of an idiot but he doesnt represent all of the community figure heads!
---
[Why don't you play a paladin in the horde?](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/471708445662248961.png?v=1)
---
I mean it's a pretty straight forward idea that a bad expansion will generate more interest in the revival of a good version.
---
Certainly, around that time private servers got a lot more popular anyway, although it is of course not quite that simple. Private servers are based on years of meticulous reconstruction after all, so developer interest had risen years before then. After that it was more of a case of "if you build it, they will come".
---
Still, they might not have been quite as popular if the demand wasn't elevated thanks to retails state at the time. It's impossible to say for sure in the end, but your aggressive attitude is really unwarranted for a fairly logical deduction.
---
The link to his (alliance) guide is somewhere in the comments here
---
For the world record run or since he got in the beta?
---
Lol this is what killed legion for me, gaining raiderio score was damn difficult
---
You have to subscribe to play Classic, but I do not believe you have to purchase BFA expansion. Right now, subscription gets you all content right up to BFA.
---
I probably reported like 30-40 bugs throughout the beta as I leveled up. Lots of time running around to report things.
---
Looking forward to this myself. Been reconnecting with old guildies and looking forward to making new friends.
---
I had 6 rank 14 chars during vanilla. I was a God among plebs.
---
Nope. https://i.imgur.com/sxk7i4k.png
---
That's my account history. Read it and weep!
---
Joke is on me. Last year Blizzard was kind enough to transfer everything on my battle.net account to a new ‚ÄúWoW2‚Äù account name so my subscription history only goes back to there (though there are some store transactions that showed up). My first account was prior to battle.net and was my real name. I was afraid of random disconnects or something showing up while streaming so I asked to get it changed.
---

Nice? Being a fraud and a liar is nice now? Or how about when he right click reported that guy? Was that how a nice guy conducts himself?
---
thanks. my main concern was getting good items and being able to pvp and dominate others but working 4 days a week i didnt think i could accomplish such things.
---
You can always play on LH testing stuff like the rest of us til then :)
---
All his non claasicwow posts are on T_D. About all you need to know. Just back away slowly.
---
Only 15$ a month for not one but now two versions of wow.
---
Mine is the exact same thing. Digital upgrade in 2010. But I 100% played before that. Like 2007 or 2008
---
No there is just a subscription to World of Warcraft, that subscription will get you classic and all retail content except the current expansion.
---
Holy crap... when I look at it that way it‚Äôs kind of messed up. 
---
I wonder how much they‚Äôve made total so far? From new subs.
---
&gt; gatekeeping
---
It's not the jump most people experience currently. I wasn't excluding BC or WotLK players on purpose. And I wasn't sure if they changed it with Cataclysm or after. My point was, the jump is a bit longer and if you're not used to it you fall. Will probably also fall come release.
---
As someone who doesn't care to follow any wow streamer, YouTubers whatever they are who is this and why is this even good news ü§î
---
You just splitting an already smaller playerbase moving to TBC and keep the Classic community is a terrible idea.
---
Warlock, Mage, Hunter and Shadowpriest are all really strong in PvP. Shaman can be really strong but depends on a lot on Procs. I'd say arguably with full gear, elemental shaman might be the strongest pvp class, but i'm sure someone will probably shout me down and correct me here :)
---
moonkins were referred to oomkins because they would go oom and be completely useless. they are not viable in vanilla. druids were healers and that's it. pallys were healers, though you could do ret in pvp. priests were best at healing but one spriest could be in a raid if you had warlocks
---
I soloed KT.
---
All I've ever played was pally and I always stayed and leveled as holy, haha. I condone it!

Totally won a headset from that promo. Good times to be back in that era. Haven't won a dang thing since. Rofl
---
It's not correct. Here an old video from 2008 that I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoZM3QHRHT4
---
On the video, 21 lvl druid (seems like 21) in a group of 3 are killing 23 lvl Aku'mai Snapjaw tortoises and are getting 54 XP per kill.
---
Now, compare it with 106 XP per kill that 23 lvl soda gets for killing 23 lvl mobs.
---
The neckbearing and general nerd-rage has reached levels I truly wasn't expecting in the last few days
---
this is fucking amazing. ACCURATE AF
---
Slippery slope fallacy. It's the idea that if thing a happens, and a is in any way similar to thing z it will inevitably cause thing z to happen as well. If you can't describe how thing a is going to cause thing z, then it's not an argument.
---
&gt; $180 a year off of every player who plays TBC / LK. 
---
As the guy you replying to you says it will break the immersion and community so less players anyway which means they lose either way.
---
You friends are trying to save you from yourself.  Choose ally and I'll be wearing your guts for garters.
---
I thought it was always a joke to how warlocks were considered shit for most of classic and their one job was basically just farming ghost mushrooms
---
To be fair, it's not 'for no reason' but rather that there were no RPPvP servers at launch. But we're supposed to be launching in 1.12.1 so it's a bad reason
---
Are you on the spectrum? Like seriously? I doubt you will ever get the chance, but just in case, please don't ever pro-create you sack of horse shit. Nostalrius is the number one reason why classic wow is here. They created the petition of 250 000 signatures and had it personally delivered to the CEO of blizzard for classic wow. The developers were invited and attended a meeting with the higher ups of blizzard to discuss how they successfully implemented vanilla wow.
---
They directly are the reason we are where we are you stupid animal.
---
_Cries in Healer_
---
Hey man! Crazy how that post is connecting with people from Reflection. DM if youre playing classic and need a guild! We‚Äôre 40~ people rn
---
Try reading the whole post.
---
really? ok that makes me feel much better lol. that was my only concern. i want to raid for a chance to get best in slot items but knowing i work weekends i thought i t  would be a huge disadvantage
---
Raiding is also very time consuming. Warlocs are simple and funny to lvl especielly their pet quests. Mages are so damn op, with their damage. And their portals and teleport is very useful
---
Literally Asmongold himself has a gf
---
Is one of them a shaman?  I would tell em to go Alliance for your class.
---
I also saw people using DiM for Dire Maul.
---
These guys are streaming and the community is giving them things to test.  They have a huge ever-growing list of things to test.  These Beta tests serve two huge purposes.  
---
1) Invite the streamers and build hype. (how many people do you think have resubbed to try and get beta access?)
---
2) Active testers finding issues and reporting them.  Perplexity and Tribe etc are doing an awesome job of this.  There are other people doing this as well, they are just overshadowed by the big streamers with huge communities.
---
I am rolling with this attitude 100%.  I spent too much time in vanilla being "nice" only to get an axe shoved up my ass.  Everyone is a target this time around.
---
Sadly you will hit a hard cap on the max rank you can get as that is entirely tied to hours played per week.  That said you will be able to get all the BG items and probably hit rank 8-10 which will get you a good chunk of the honor gear.
---
Haha, why is he even playing the beta, didn't he say he won't play Classic if the sharding is in or something.
---
Play what you like, a guild will always come along and accept you for you as a player, not the character.
---
If you are hardcore then you cant do such things
---
Northerend was tiny on this map
---
No you don't, the invite wave checks eligibility.
---
Hi, /u/ChairmanLyu
---
My guild plans to raid tues and wed night, most guilds I know raid something like that. Tues - Thurs later at night, or something similar.
---
&gt;people in r/wow get upset when you talk about classic outside of specific classic posts so it's no surprise people come over here now lol
---
yeah, these teens are invading our subreddit, go away to your dying retail game, please!
---
I am from EU and have beta.
---
My coworkers helped get me into WoW. We all worked 6 10-12 hour shifts a week but most of them still managed to find the time to raid and pvp. It's doable if you nolife it like they did. Those of us who didn't want to nolife it didn't get much done because of our work schedules and other non-wow priorities. Pick your poison I guess. I think a 40 hour work week will allow you to raid and pvp without killing your social life, but if you work a lot of overtime but want to have a life, honestly, I'd have to say the answer is a hard "no".
---
Lol I highly doubt the majority of big streamers are rolling around in a lambo.
---
Hunter least played other than faction specifics? Didn‚Äôt see that coming considering how popular hunter had been over the years.
---
It does not interfere and animated backgrounds are cool, thank you for the info :)
---
RPPVP pls Blz!
---
Beta is months long, god forbid someone has fun for 29 hours
---
It is really easy when you know what is going on. Compared to retail which is hard even when you know the encounters in and out. 
---
Just because a game is easy does not mean you can't die. A lot of stuff in classic is basically "you fuck up you die". Doesn't mean it's difficult, just that it punishes you when you fail.
---
I most referring to the slippery slope thing facetiously.  However I feel like it has been debated/described to death all over this subreddit if you're actually interested, other people have attempted to describe the mechanism.
---
update: it didnt
---
Fuck this is good.
---
oc do not steal
---
As a true-blooded member of the Horde, Garrosh was my hero. I always thought the Hellscreams were really cool characters.
---
You are right. It's not just "add a toggle and done".
---
Animations and the code which handles them are intricately linked. It was a lot of work for the Classic team to restore how it was in Vanilla. And I'm sure there are many other things with the other art assets.
---
It would be another major undertaking adding a "new coat of paint" to the game. (Are there updated assets for everything in Vanilla in modern WoW? If not those must be created too.) They might decide to do so but I don't think they will. The smart choice would be to let the Classic team work on the expansions after release.
---
This situation is so utterly confusing. I just saw a post above this one where someone is claiming he got into the beta without being subbed, but had to purchase sub to play... what is even going on?
---
Yes, that's exactly his point.
---
maybe I am retarded but I did make a sub... how can I download it now? :( sorry
---
It's like saying Microsoft aren't special and we should be thanking IBM and Alan Sugar.
---
It's really bad. I've been stuck halfway through gnomer where the warr tank DC'd out of nowhere, and our shaman stepped up and tanked us through the rest of it. We had a lock and hunter with us though, so we had plenty of CC, sustain, and off tanking to help them.
---
Honestly, it's super off-meta but if you had a group of 5 friends and no one wanted to go druid/warr, it's *possible* that you could shaman tank decently far while leveling. You'd need to have good support and CC, like warlocks, hunters, mages, and rogues. I could see you getting as far as Uld/mara/ZF, but ST, Scholo, BRS, Strat, are definitely all too hard for a shaman tank.
---
his jaw literally dropped when he saw his Imp get 1 shot
---
And feral druids who have the same par of threat generation single target.
---
you dont need to be subbed to get beta acces
---
If my cat Druid doesn't then those crazy Hunter cats better not!  &gt;:(

Maybe, maybe not. If Blizzard is getting the feedback they need for this stage then probably. If they're not, or they're ready to move on to more and new feedback, they'll probably send out more.
---
I highly doubt they have a strict invite schedule outside of the stress test waves. Everything else is "as and when needed."
---
Just going for another plug. Just play and figure it out the first time. Classic wow was about discovery and leveling. Don't worry about when you get to 60. Unlike modern wow, the game was ABOUT leveling back then.
---
You might want to go back in time over a decade and a half and let them know your concerns.
---
Read the second line
---
You can tank dungeons on a shaman just fine. It is definitely viable. That being said big difference between viable and optimal though. All of your dungeons will go slower as a result. You may also wipe more because you don't have taunt but, you can do it. 
---
This guy is your north star.

Classic isn't the problem. Retail is
---
Very established meta wich not even more then a year ago they discovered fury tanking. 
---
Not saying you‚Äôre wrong you and your guild do you but personally i think this attitude is very toxic and its even spreading to casual players because for some reason they take this as holy gossip even tho the raids until AQ are very easily doable with ‚Äúmeme‚Äù specs
---
We will just have to disagree that ‚Äúthings have moved on‚Äù. Difficult games will always be rewarding. It‚Äôs human nature. 
---
And part of my point here is that I would be very surprised if the design team has/will learn nothing from this experience. Am I saying dungeon finder will be nixxed? Nope. But from my experience over the last several expansions, taking some queues from past philosophies that were successful is exactly what they need right now. 
---
Thrall coming back in the cinematic is a perfect metaphor for this.
---
wait for the inevitable TBC servers :P
---
2h fury works pretty good for Horde because windfury essentially replaces the necessity for Sword spec with a 2 hander. 
---
If you're alliance, Arms with a 2h will do comparable or better DPS than 2h Fury since sword spec is a native 5% CoH for an extra swing, and HoJ adds 2% to that. 7% total CoH for extra swings is quite significant. Sweeping Strikes can add some good AoE utility for situations like MC imps, BWL suppression room, etc. For early raids like MC and BWL the debuff slot min/maxing doesn't matter that much. As long as you have the important ones like sunders, curse of elements, demo shout, thunderclap, etc. you have some wiggle room for a few debuff slots.  AQ and Naxx is where min/maxing becomes a bit more important.
---
Oh really druids don't get it?  That's sad :'(
---
SL lock and Spriest are stronger in 1v1. SL spec is banned in duel tournaments for that very reason.
---
Thanks Nostalrius
---
Thanks Pservers
---
Pservers supporters were always treated unrespecfully by wow players, the same players that today celebrate Classic
---
What are the levels of the other 2 druids in that group? XP scales based on group comp. A higher level in there could skew things quite a bit.
---
Interesting, that would also alleviate confusion.
---
I actually enjoyed mists, hated cata, wod and BFA legion was just a warm fart on my leg in the sense that it was just there; Nothing special.
---
Traps were instant in vanilla.
---
Tipsout copied all of the "guides" he has "made", took them from other websites and copypasted them onto wowhead. Why? Because he wants the exposure, at the end of each of "his" guides he just promotes his channels, without acknowlidging the actual guide creators. This guy can't make any guides from his own because he joined WoW in cataclysm, he's just a scam.
---
You will be sent an email, but it will not contain a key. It will just let you know your account has been flagged. But from what streamers have said, the email can be hours late, so your Launcher will show up with beta access apparently before anything else.
---
There were two kinds of changes that happened to WoW over time: one was quality of life, the other was watering down the game for mass appeal.
---
Wanting the game to not be watered down again is called nostalgia for some reason.
---
I think one could only say BC is more similar to vanilla than any other expansion, but that's it really.
---
Of course those aren‚Äôt Vanilla. They‚Äôre Wildberry and Citrus Cherry.
---
Boosting neckbeards are usually balanced by stream snipers, if they even consider doing world buffs and overall scarab lord require a lot of outdoor grind.
---
don't take it too hard, sub has been invaded by people who want the game to change to their benefit.
---
I hope they keep updating Vanilla wow...maybe bringing in the barber shop.... or transmogs.... little quality of life improvements, maybe expanding the molten core to a new chamber with new bosses
---
How is a pre order sold out?! Can‚Äôt they just make more? First I miss out on the FE 2060 and now this..
---
You can absolutely tank Dungeons on a shaman. It is viable but, not optimal. You dungeons will go slower and you will wipe more then a warrior but it is viable.
---
This guy is your lode star
---
WotLK Servers where allready super populated by the time Cataclysm was released, so im not sure how much WoD has todo with that.
---
this is turning into /r/posteverytimeaninternetcelebrityfarts
---
Why not? Because it's inconvenient?
---
Anything truly worth doing is going to be inconvenient at times. Sucking it up and soldiering through that is part of what makes the experience both memorable and rewarding.
---
Wanting experiences to come without any real struggle is precisely what led to retail becoming what it is, and why so many of us here lost interest.
---
As someone who has been raiding on private servers for the past 2.5 years... these streamers are cringeworthy how bad they are.
---
yes, you can level Ret and still heal in PVE along the way just fine in INT gear.
---
mob dmg, mob health, pet health, mob resistances, mob spawnsm, mobs following you, hp ticks, mp ticks, everything you could whine from lvl 1 to 6
---
I've always found it fun to lan with my friends and be in a whole separate world from them and fable my achievements. I might have to continue on my solo journey.
---
Ah I see, so if it doesn't DC you, it's currently on Illidan's loot table?
---
Did you resub before or after they released the beta? Also congrats and have fun!
---
&gt; PS. A fuckload of players will come back for BC even if they ignored Classic. 
---
And a lot of people will leave when it gets to BC it's a lose lose.
---
&gt; Yeah but less people will quit IMO then letting Blizzard take the creative reins again 
---
People will quit from playing the same content aswell
---
is it difficult to dual box?? i know i'll need to make a second account but whatever
---
Is this post implying that it's harder than pservers or easier?
---
It happened in vanilla.
---
Source: I'm a vanilla vet, and that spam got old real fast.

*If it dies, it dies.* ^^^For the record it won't die.
---
Have you seen anything about if the fishing contest will be at launch or added later?  Great video BTW.  :)
---
Yeah i think it'll be pretty fun and thanks for giving some info on it. What about you?
---
Haha. Depends on the parenting studs I guess.
---
That meme is fine.
---
Thanks for the comment, any exposure helps. These are the little things that really break the illusion for me and I find them important. 
---
I hope your day is as pleasant as you are :) 
---
See you in Azeroth!
---
I was playing Everquest when I was 9. Played it for maybe a year or two. I went back about 6 months ago and started up on a private server. I remembered about 90% of everything, including being able to navigate myself entirely through dungeons and cities without a map. Maybe you just have a really bad memory?
---
Destiny.
---
I think it's entirely server based. I played on Destromath-US starting in March 2005 and I don't remember people calling it VC there. I later played on Malfurion-US which wasn't created until November of 2005 and there everyone called it VC. I believe Dire Maul was out before that server went live so that could be the key.
---
This was expected.
---
42
---
Meanwhile, in today dying BFA, you don't even say "hi" when you join a M+ group...
---
Tipsout was not prepared.  
---
He should have brought a casket.
---
Played open beta and stress test, day one account 11/23/2004 at 8:30am, been in every beta since Wrath, currently subbed and I don't have Classic beta. Its random.
---
nope no /focus on classic.
---
Hahahah really?  Shit Im gonna have to check the vod for some laughs.  You would think these asshats were the developers the way they talk
---
I mean, most people already saw this coming right? He's never even played Vanilla.
---
That is true, thanks for giving me another perspective on it!
---
It's not ready. Or they want to specifically target non-PvP content. Or both.
---
If you're PvPing, you're not doing other stuff that they want you to do in this phase, and not giving them the data they need right now.
---
After deadmines Mcconnel was literally asking people to come gank Asmon, since they hadn't seen anyone the whole time.
---
This is so much better than the one posted yesterday that literally just had random fire effects all over and looked terrible
---
I thought they said that there wouldn't be any RPPVP realms in classic?
---
This is why I didn't want a beta test. The amount of "bugs" that aren't bugs that'll be reported is just going to slow the fault-finding.
---
It'd be quicker with an internal beta
---
The weird lore thing about Undead and the light is that it physically hurts them to wield it. Even more badass when you think about it
---
The moment they went to "bring the player, not the class", WoW sucked.
---
Haha five years later. Really, they should just add Kara to lvl 60 content and call it a day.
---
I plan on doing every quest possible, even low level ones, even "breadcrumb" quests like this one. so damn right I'm going to Khaz Modan. although I might save it for once I'm done with Elwynn/Westfall/Redridge/Darkshire.
---
Pick a class that can do that. Rogue and Mage are both very friendly to people with a job. You will be fine. One of the nice things about classic is that some classes are more casual then others. Warrior for instance requires you to make blood sacrifices. They worth it though.
---
Good for Asmongold. Like him or hate him, he's entertaining and his twitch prime sub count from beating a level 19 dungeon in a 15 year old game is proof of that. I'm happy for the dude.
---
pretty boring indeed
---
i just don't like horde, i can't do it. i don't like any of the starting zones and i LOVE the alliance zones. the atmosphere of ironforge/stormwind/duskwood/westfall and STV is right there to the south... Waow
---
Joana deff should have been 1st lol
---
Just don‚Äôt use decursive then 4Head
---
Retail is all about endgame and instant gratification.  Classic lets you enjoy all aspects of the game: leveling, dungeons, getting loot, and actually talking to people.  
---
I've never understood how Blizzard failed to realize that they were slowly disassembling the game that they carefully put together.  I knew they were on the wrong path when they put in the summoning stones at Instance entrances.  Convenience does not equal quality.  You can get a nasty meal from McDonald's real quick, or you can take your time and cook a meal with your friends and family that will taste better and you'll enjoy the experience, as well as the reward.
---
Tauren hitboxes aren't a bug. Their hitboxes were changed in TBC.
---
I mean, I played in vanilla too, and I cannot remember "Did somebody say?" spam.
---
I dunno Asmon didnt seem to care that much. This whole thread is a mess of "Hurr streamer fanboys" vs "hurr WPvP ganks are dumb and you're lame trolls".
---
An amusing thing happens and people apparently shit themselves both kinds of ways.
---
Get better friends.
---
Yeah I was like what a dummy. However certain quests did sometimes put a yellow arrow on the map. Like the defies brotherhood quest telling you to go to lakeshire, there‚Äôs an arrow pointing on the minimap towards lakeshire
---
When did you subscribe for the first time?
---
 Clip?
---
Considering a friend of mine only subbed yesterday and got invited, after the first wave had gone implies this is clearly not the case.
---
Wait 3 months after Classic is out. Streamers will complain theres nothing to do(after their viewers give them whatever they want) and casuals will start to claim to hate it as well. People already want addons that make the game easier and the beta has been out two days lmao
---
Happens with every single WoW update.
---
Yes, because optimal rotation for classes were so so difficult back in vanilla. I remember my days of spamming shadowbolt after saccing my sub on my lock. The pure difficulty!
---
Vanilla had dBm too, which kinda told you what bosses were going to do too. So yeah, add-ons already existed back in the day and were 10x more powerful than  WA were. You're delusional or just didn't play in vanilla if you think otherwise.
---
generally most players who were on before Dire Maul know what DM is and don't use VC. It looks like most of the Dire Maul post patch player base just didn't understand that it had multiple wings and no one ever ran an LFG DM without a wing on it. It was always DME or DMEast , while DM was always Deadmines.
---
\&gt;If you are not currently an active subscriber then this would disqualify you from being considered in future waves
---
The wording here confuses me. So basically if you didn't resub before the first wave went out your fucked?
---
How did your friends know they were invited? I have heard no emails are going out. Did the launcher just update randomly?
---
Fuck.
---
Some people find rushing for big goals to be fun.
---
Customer Service is never a reputable source, ever. There have been plenty of examples of CS reps answering questions then having developers immediately state the opposite. 
---
That said, this one looks legit, but who knows.
---
The active account chart is very telling.
---
"if you are not currently an active sub then this would disqualify you from future waves"
---
So no point in resubbing now.
---
I guess we can just see how it goes, personally I don‚Äôt want changes after the games last patch.
---
Of course it was a business decision, however Nost also provided concrete statistics that there was significant demand for Vanilla.
---
what do you mean? Do you see the range of their auto atacks and the 8 yard deadzone is more like a 15 yard one.
---
What is LH?
---
There will always be people that rush. I don't get it, myself, but to each their own. My old group is reuniting for classic, and we plan to take our time and have a good time with all the shenanigans we will undoubtedly get into along the way.
---
Ohhhh okay that makes sense.  I never played in vanilla as a shaman so I wasn't sure how it worked really. Thanks!
---
If it's none of your business, don't post.
---
I love the lore, but it isnt the main thing for me. I used to read a bit each day on a site that did daily lore articles, ive lost it to time, and really wish I could remember it &gt;.&gt;
---
Hah, im not surprised.. Pservers get so much wrong, its WAY to easy compared to the Blizzard Vanilla. I tested a lock on the "top" pserver, it was laughable easy from the first mob. Mana and hp regen was waay to quick, mobs had stupid low damage and hp. I think alot of pserver players are in for a surprise.
---
There is a regrowth resto build that is quite competitive in late-endgame.
---
cohhcarnage, just a guy who loves games not really all that skilled at most of them
---
I couldn't play a blood elf lol. I could play a troll, tho.
---
yea in BFA lol. in vanilla you could.
---
good
---
Asmongold getting 3v1'd was way better :p
---
Maybe his kid's name is Brand.
---
I plan on leveling slowing, reading quest text and not reading any websites.  If I want to know something in game I will ask someone in game.
---
Oh you sweet summer child. *sharpens daggers*
---
I mean if someone wants to rush then let them, who cares.  I'm for sure going to be taking my time while leveling and relearn all the cool lore that vanilla has to offer.
---
There are a few issues with duels that I believe makes it a very poor measure of overall pvp performance in vanilla WoW:
---
1. It artificially limits the space you have to work with. A rogue cannot reset fights by running away and guaranteeing restealth.
---
2. It does not allow a rogue to war of attrition a class like the warlock by abusing fight resets. So the rogue can't just kill pets or bait other soul shard using spells out of the warlock until the warlock doesn't have soul shards or a pet anymore. This would be possible without the space restriction.
---
3. Duels are only 1v1. So this does not speak to any class's pvp viability in group pvp settings. In 2v2 for example, mage rogue beats any warlock combination because sl warlocks can't burst and cc as well as mage rogue.
---
4. It doesn't allow line of sight abuse. Most duels I've seen were in open spaces, or at least places without line of sight obstructions. This by definition benefits any class with ranged abilities. Imagine a duel with an arena sized pillar in the middle of it, the rogue will be able to actually have a chance to reset fights without using any cooldowns.
---
Despite all that, I still haven't seen a rogue with a full pvp set (tidal charm, shields, all the consumables) in a dueling tournament. Perhaps you can link me to a tournament where a rogue has these items and are allowed to use them and still fails to beat a warlock? Because I know many tournaments put restrictions on certain item or even spec uses. This is to make other classes more viable and create a more entertaining tournament. This is not a reflection of how good or bad each class is without such limitations though.
---
Tbf I think there's a big portion of Classic players who hope retail crumbles too. There's always gonna be a dickhead group that can't accept that both can exist in harmony. OSRS and RS3 has the same problem.
---
Then it wouldn't be Classic.
---
Am I the only one that thinks this is a bad thing?  All it does it promote the culture of min/maxing that just breeds toxicity.
---
which implies they might for he full version.
---
this is a huge change, and essentially destroys pvp servers.
---
My alt is for leisure my main is for bumrushing to the raiding scene.
---
Classic should in theory run better then pserver stuff purely based on engine optimization for modern hardware.
---
i was going to roll a warrior lol
---
Absolutely! I just responded to another similar comment, if we don‚Äôt hear about arson devs being on beta soon I will definitely be campaigning in favor
---
I heard rep values are less than pservers. Keep us posted!
---
What if my friends are stronger players than me?
---
The callback to oldschool wow machinima in each of his videos is really what gets it for me.
---
He is super straight to the point in what he wants to teach you.
---
Then all this need to goof off pressure builds up in these crisp cut animations.
---
Those birches are immune to bleeds too. Just total douchebag machines in general.

&gt;with a lot of haste on it

True but I never thought that vanilla was perfect, then again neither was TBC, that's why I'd love to see a frankenbuild of the two üòú
---
Yep, people who start a toon after about a week after gonna prob rage quit...
---
Blizzard has confirmed it will be the 1.12 versions of the pvp gear. You will most likely not see the level 58 gear. Even if it was in the game, it would be a waste of gold because the 60 versions are vastly superior.
---
First of all, great advice! If not one of the best you can give to both new and old players.
---
Props for taking the time to write down all the dungeons and providing useful information. 
---
I appreciate you!
---
I have some bad news for you
---
I hope they both fail! Beat that.
---
If you have a good guild who doesn't spend 3 hours to clear a dungeon at lvl 60 you can gear up within a reasonable time. Also, unless you are a main tank you don't need BiS gear to raid.
---
15 BUCKS

LITTLE MAN
---
PUT THAT SHIT
---
IN MY HAND
---
Hrnf. StaySafe is Bae fersure.
---
This is what I want to know as well. I have game time from gold but do not have a active sub atm.
---
Orb of Deception!
---
Well played
---
There‚Äôs obviously a split in the WoW community, but the same can also be said for Classic players who believe that retail has failed.
---
I never got a chance to play Nostalrius before it was closed, but the videos I watched of it looked amazing. We wouldn‚Äôt be here if it weren‚Äôt for them.
---
Its an insecurity thing, the op can't handle when others find fun outside his narrow view of it.
---
I honestly wish the best for both games, anything else would be childish
---
Last person I knew named stump was off his rocker.
---
They‚Äôre more reputable than the people speculating on reddit.
---
I think February
---
thx
---
yup NA!
---
This particular episode was filmed before the changes to Eviscerate scaling. The other episodes were filmed even earlier, before weapon speed normalization was implemented. Which meant that a Backstab with slow weapons such as the Barman Shanker would deal a lot of damage.
---
I am so happy I never played pservers.
---
So you can't click raid frames to target the person?
---
This kind of thing significantly changes the way the game is played. I'm all for removing the crazy 1 button rotation macros, or 1 button healbot macros, but I still want to play the same game.
---
That was like, basically what it meant to have an imp back in vanilla though.  Could they really tank anything in pservers?
---
Then don't sub, because the odds of getting in with an account made prior to TBC are still probably less than 1%. Its not worth resubbing over if you value your money.
---
Same. Underworld and Thunderbluff are garbage. I also don't feel much personality or empathy from the Horde models when I play with them in dungeons or battlegrounds. So weird lol.
---
Esfand also confirmed this in his stream . Each day more beta invites are sent.
---
I wish I could read this stuff lol
---
after going elwynn -&gt; westfall while leveling yesterday, it is definitely a trap. the quests are all spread out. everything is too high level to go right from elwynn, and i felt behind the curve the whole way. going to try another run going elwynn -&gt; darkshore. i seem to remember this being the way of leveling quickly back in teh day, because i can recall making the run from ironforge to menethil when pretty low level back in vanilla.
---
They aren‚Äôt your real friends then.
---
Fuck fishing
---
Meh I mean he is right and he is wrong. The people he is talking about are just as annoying as he is. There are extremists on both sides, and both are equally annoying. That being said classic isn't for everyone. Its not a perfect game, and not everyone who enjoys retail wow will enjoy classic. Which is fine.
---
No rp-pvp servers mate
---
probably going to see a big wave of invites over the weekend if i had to bet money.
---
Amazing work!
---
But please don't use Comic Sans. No, God, please no.
---
Srsly, change font and keep up the good work :)
---
So tired of this sub telling me that rushing to 60 isnt fun, sorry but i'll do it like I want to and have fun doing it.
---
One hilarious mistake I made is that I forgot that Stormwind/Ironforge Teleport skills exist at 20! So I was hearthing like a non-mage pleb to SW/IF until level 29
---
This... This is why I want classic.  When it meant exploring and not a damn theme park toddler's railway ride
---
I originally registered with a Netscape.net email
---
Fuck me I guess
---
Just ignore it mate. This sub is one of the most elitist places I've ever seen. I bet most of the people calling people out for not playing vanilla didnt play it either.
---
It is a disgrace to exclude players that don‚Äòt have an active subscription honestly. I think the players who could help finding bugs and overall contribute to the beta the best dont‚Äòt have an active subscription at all. 
---
I would‚Äòve love to contribute to the beta since I started to play at EU launch 13.feb.2005 and i genuinely think that I could help blizzard to optimize the game in a number og ways
---
This is all I drank for a week straight and my shit turned into blue paste. lol.
---
Thank you! I only found from when we merged battle net accounts!
---
Pets aren't effected. Windfury is only applied to the main-hand weapon.
---
It isn't even applied feral druids since they aren't physically attacking with a weapon.
---
level 1-10 they could literally solo mobs by themselves
---
I must see clip
---
If you actually like these people, its more fun to play with them and not be on your faction of choice, trust me. 
---
Shaman doesn't really play like paladin at all, the experience is not similar in my opinion.
---
Yeah, Developers are used to this. They completely know that they will never please everybody. that's like a basic tenant in World of Warcraft.
---
Can't choose between tauren and orc. I generally prefer tauren but just not crazy about their size and the constant scratching.
---
I recall that as well in vanilla. It was a pretty trash talent due to it requiring drain soul to deal to the final damage.
---
I was really surprised by his behavior, no really like him tbh. He seemed depressed as fuck
---
Wow. I will be honest I was so young (well high school freshman) that I did not know I was pretty much in this from the beginning. 2 months after release all the way till about July 2010 when I moved for college. Makes me sad / miss these times. Then my 1 month "hey lets try this BFA thing looks kinda cool WHERE ARE MY TALENT TREE POINTS THIS IS THE WORST" attempt at trying to play again.
---
Just less usable. I've tried switching for a week, twice. I made it 3 days before I rage-uninstalled it and went back to Skada.
---
Cringe and bluepilled
---
Okay team, let‚Äôs get me in the beta next! Blizzard, put cornysheep in the beta!! Woo we‚Äôre doing it!
---
I guess transfers would be an option. I was once stuck on a p-server realm (no names due to this subs rules), which had like 11k concurrent players. Personally I really hated how overcrowded and -farmed every zone was. Also the ground being plastered with corpses everywhere I went didn't quite help with immersion. (Great WPvP though)
---
This p-server also had a second, struggling realm with 1k concurrent players. Would've gladly transferred over there, but they didn't bother to implement them.
---
dead mines
---
Uh, I am not a child that has not played vanilla so I am aware of it because I played it and didn't need a private server to get a tiny feel of what vanilla was like?
---
I had a horrible [Raider.IO](https://Raider.IO) but was 4th highest geared mage on server with high parses,  the number of times people declined my invitation was amazing (even when I had a high ilvl....)
---
No you pretty much hit the nail on the head, people don't want arbitary changes to ruin classic like it did retail
---
I never ever claimed that?
---
If there aren't as many tourists leaving then this is what I would see as the best option:
---
Cap the servers out, let there be q times, and allow people to free xfer off.  Now there are a lot of things people don't like about this so I will list them and explain why I think it's not as bad as you think.
---
1.  I don't want to wait in a q 
---
2. I don't want to have to leave my server 
---
The first one, is just the nature of the beast.  If q times happen on your server, well it happens.  This is authentic vanilla TBH you can't have your cake and eat it too.  Plus this probably wouldn't last very long because of the people who would leave the server making it a less congested one.
---
The second one, then don't.  You don't have to leave your server if you don't want to, there are going to be PLENTY of people who choose to.  Take me for example, I only plan on playing classic with my 2 buds and for the most part I will just run 5 mans, craft most my gear, and just do Wpvp and bgs.  If I raid it will for sure be in a PuG later on.  So leaving a populated server a month after launch or however short it is, will not be an issue for me.  And I'm sure at this point that's how a lot of people will play the game as they probably are short on time such as myself.
---
Anyone that starts in phase 2 when we have honor but no bgs is going to have a really rough time.
---
If there is not an RP-PVP Server then will will Pick a PVP Server and Run internal RP.  Classic WoW Guilds Have a Category for it so I'm gonna keep my hopes Lofty. lmao.
---
True, but you'd have to spend time to even find tip-worthy indie movies.
---
Bringing this back from the analogy to twitch, take a look at me, for example: 
---
I don't really watch streams often, because most of the time I'm playing games that require my full attention, or I'm playing with friends and hang out in voice. In the rare cases where I'm watching a stream, I watch streams of people who already have a lot of exposure. "Oh, that last Asmongold twitch clips video I saw on YouTube was funny, I'm going to check out if he's currently streaming".
---
When he is streaming and I'm watching him for a while, I'm probably going to give him my twitch prime sub, because it doesn't cost me anything and I'm not going to actively search for low viewership streamers that are as entertaining, just to have the feeling of "saving someone's day".
---
Then i'll be wearing your garters for guts.
---
Your going to be downvoted but this is truth. There is a circlejerk in this sub and that is being condescending towards players that will rush to 60 and play competitively. Apparently the only way to have fun is to play casually and look down upon hardcore players.
---
I agree man. People just struggle to accept two people can get enjoyment out of two different things, and god forbid they enjoy *both*, which is what I'm intending to do
---
Mythic +‚Äôs are dungeons....
---
Wow, another post telling us that playing casually is the only way to have fun. Thanks for your contribution.
---
Oh do not get me wrong, I do not want that as an MMO! Just that retail WoW feels more like a mash-up of action and MMO mechanics, and committing to just one may make the experience more satisfying.
---
&gt; How are you so retarded
---
Im not reading that Bye!
---
Don't take time off for a game you've never played.
---
I honestly don't care at this point, I seriously think classic WoW will do to retail what OSRS did to the updated version.
---
Once classic is out there is no reason for me to pay attention to anything retail has to offer, unless they do a complete 180 and attempt to rebuild the game in the vanilla flavor.
---
Your client doesnt even know about that stealthed player, so there is no way to display that grass effect. (You dont send client information that it doesnt need)
---
Hey, we started two days apart!
---
Sorry. I'll wear my star next time so you can send me to the gas chambers easier.   
---
Have a nice day.
---
I read through the comments and it looks to me like OP is the only one being salty.  They're mostly making fun if him.
---
Also because very few people can separate the hard data of the game from their feelings and expectations.
---
Too bad I couldn't watch over the screaming stop posting this crap
---
Lmao fr, it's gonna be a huge feelsbadman for so many young souls.
---
OMG I just remembered that in vanilla camping starting points was a thing because the guards weren't yet those huge elites that can handle 60s with ease
---
I remember you had to run to nearest city or type in general and find a 60 who was willing to come protect the starter spot. 
---
There was one time I remember like 3 horde in dun morough and like 6 Alli dudes from IF came prancing in on their elite mounts and they had one of the coolest pvp battles I had ever seen at the time.
---
Vanilla really was so special
---
They will have all of their raid designers working on retail, there‚Äôs just no chance that it becomes OSRS 2.0
---
https://youtu.be/TAm0oT7epqs?t=3232
---
I mean he clearly states after the fact that its *different* not wrong. He said "Imp does feel too strong on pservers.". But hey, lets upvote the OP because he didn't get a beta inv and doesn't have anything better to do than to bash on content creators.
---
 [https://www.vanillafriends.com/](https://www.vanillafriends.com/)
---
Yes it was a post-Vanilla thing and started with [Dirge]
---
rip in piece? i believe the in piece was already included
---
&gt; Shadow priest was a very strong contender for me! But I figured I would be pigeon holed into healing in any content outside PvP
---
This is unfortunately true.
---
I share this opinion, however most people here will downvote you like crazy.
---
lay on hands at 80% mana nice one
---
Thanks, appreciate it! I really think that we can contribute to the testing of the new API.
---
I remember buying the blue for the elf lol, the drink was actually pretty good.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing them come back and i‚Äôm not even a soda person.
---
Did Hemet just dab on the haters?
---
Judging from all the other comments on this post, I am starting to think that was just a thing on Eonar (EU). It always seemed like the simplest form of disambiguation to me though.
---
This is great advice for a PVE server but I‚Äôm joining a PVP server. I need to level as fast as possible so that I don‚Äôt get destroyed in STV
---
‚Äú1v3‚Äù ‚ÄúxD‚Äù
---
I think there's a bit of truth in both opinions, I know i'm not going through classic for the level experience as i've been there done that, I am looking forward to experiencing the endgame content i never got a chance to when it was relevant.  Also I love rushing now as well.
---
Thanks! I'll take another look at them :)
---
This has already been posted a million times.
---
1. Who said streamers are skilled, they are just there for entertainment.
---
2. It was a hunter who ganked them when they were fighting mobs.... wow such surprise
---
The 1v1s you refer to are in duel scenarios where often there is no line of sight and of course there's a small space to work with. In an open world 1v1 fight, rogues can take down rank 10 geared shadow priests and warlocks.
---
With warlocks you can basically just build a harassment cycle that baits out soulshard using spells while actively denying soul shards from being farmed. Eventually the warlock has no more pets and is unable to use any spells that requires a shoul shard.
---
Yeah I know, god forbid we have different opinions right?
---
Ya but Kaska was a fucking DDOSer iirc.
---
Anything political
---
As in the community has levelling down to a science. More efficient routes and strats have been discovered since 2005. He was groundbreaking to apply commonly used speedrun strats (multiple attempts, route testing, timed splits etc) when no one else was doing it. His advantage was methods and tactics, not skill or talent for gameplay.
---
Right? I'm very happy that I'm still worth your time, man! Stay with me, I feel like we're having something great here.
---
Also, it's very comical of you to assume that i'm of low intelligence - I went from unsure to being able to give you a heads up in one sentence, isn't that great? I'm a fast learner.
---
"Stay on the road/path, it's safer"
---
-people who haven't tried to run through STV
---
Dbm back then was nowhere near what it is now either. And since rotations were so easy all the more reason to disable weak auras
---
&gt;
---
I am genuinely concerned for the mental health of some of the posters there, with hundreds of thousands of posts and freely admitting that their biggest focus in life right now is to fight for a pure Classic experience, most likely because thats the last time they were happy in life.
---
Wheres the lie?
---
Impossible, you're a Paladin of the Light.
---
Who the fuck drew these damn lines in the sand. Let people who enjoy retail enjoy retail and vice versa. They are 2 completely different games.
---
Blizzard, plz fix
---
i think people have forgotten that not every game is made to cater to their specific needs, some games are just not for certain people and theres nothing wrong with that. but everyone expects every game to be made in their perfect vision
---
I remember you can get your acc back if it used your real name and you show them photo ID or something of that sort.
---
Blizz is pretty good at recovering those old accounts
---
\&gt; BFA is a lot of fun, mythic + and the raids alone provide countless hours of enjoyment for non-casual players... 
---
You had me convinced until then. It sounds like you don't play much but then call yourself a high-end competitive player. I played BFA for the first month and did so much fucking mythic+ that I played on a private vanilla server once and unsubbed to retail immediately after. 
---
Mythic+ would have gotten boring to you by now. You have 100% convinced me BFA is nothing but bad.
---
esfand is really bad, and more importantly really annoying. i don't know why anyone likes watching him stream
---
Really nice wall paper, but a pity it does not come different resolutions. On my 2k monitor it has to cut out a lot. I lose the gnome, the dwarf and pretty close to the human.
---
why are you guys so hyped for beta ? Just go on pserv if you cant wait to play.
---
Classic isn't better than Retail.
---
Also, Retail isn't better than Classic.
---
They both have things about them which are great and some things that are awful. You can't just generalize to say one is better than the other, period. They were two different games for two different generations and two different time periods.
---
Goblins are the primordial race
---
Could probably find a dozen amongst all the different patches and various states of bugs and lag. 
---
I mentioned this in another comment, you could temporarily get this behavior sometimes throughout vanilla (even meleeing at ranged weapon range and around walls/rocks, but it was never the norm)
---
Iirc Malorne is more of a "step father"
---
oh look, another one of these posts that has no faith in anyone except themselves figuring out how to have fun
---
Unreliable narrator.
---
would like to know this as well so I can check at work. thx
---
No, it's because Warlocks were "fed shit and kept in the dark", just like mushrooms.
---
Friends are what make games memorable. Go horde. When they get bored, or only play to raid, of it you can switch to pali in a year or two as an alt.
---
Google stainless steel thunderfury. A few people out there are doing key rings.
---
Yup. Hunter pet kiting, via Eyes of the Beast. Or, distracting shot and run like hell with Aspect of the Cheetah active.
---
Were you guys on the Venture Co.?
---
Well for one, mythic + dungeons are more competitive. You need to beat a timer, which means you all need good gear, the correct class comp, and need to speed through the dungeon with no time to talk. Most of these mythic + dungeons last about 30 mins or so. In classic, many of the dungeons lasted for an hour or most likely more. Trying to compare classic leveling dungeons to mythic+ dungeons makes no sense.
---
I like to think Divine Protection is just a holy hamster ball and they go spinning out of control at high speeds upon landing
---
What profs. do u suggest for pvp lock?
---
Fuck yes now I can have Goku scream when the boss hits execute phase
---
That makes sense and probably why I didn't really remember the pre-TBC Stormwind AH much.
---
agreeeeed
---
Anyone know if there will be another wave today?
---
I am not a RP person but will provide any support I can for this so the people who love to RP can do so in peace.
---
Not I. I sail for Savage Lands this time around.
---
&gt;I'm very happy that I'm still worth your time, man
---
Must not have great experiences with others to have these expectations of yourself lmao
---
You must already know how much of a twat you come off as, I guess apathy is less appealing than ignorance. 
---
It's Reddit btw, if you're using it for anything besides killing time then feelsbatman and there's no better way to kill time for me than entertaining a Reddit troll. Like I said, comical :)
---
Yes... It's possible to find other players who play and raid casually due to having priorities they place above online gaming.
---
Burn yourself out? What a casual
---
My reasoning is that while both beta and private servers will lead to my characters being wiped, any bugs I come across and report will ensure the permanent product in August is the best it can be.
---
Who drew these lines? Saltmongers like the OP, who can't stand the fact that two different groups of people like two different things.
---
The writing and button mashing of modern wow is what puts me off. They tried so hard to make garrosh a villain, and failed. Now they're trying to make sylvanas a villain and failing. 
---
This sickness in the horde is horse shit when the alliance wouldn't accept bloodelves because they're racist, imprisoning them in the kirin tor dungeons after they taught them magic. The fact that the orcs tried to leave and become better people and the alliance hunted them across the ocean trying to destroy them. 
---
Let's gloss over all of that and pretend the ragtag group of horde are the villains, despite sylvanas decreeing she would never be a lich king.
---
My bad then. I stopped during MoP. I will probably play retail in august since i will be subbed for classic anyways and see how it is these days!
---
Unless you want to make a 59 Twink...
---
eh, I don‚Äôt understand why people can‚Äôt just let both games coexist. i‚Äôm gonna spend a good amount of time playing both since my subscription pays for both. I loved Classic, but it wasn‚Äôt without its flaws. I love retail, but it‚Äôs not without its flaws.
---
You have good intentions but that didn‚Äôt work for BFA
---
If you're a rogue you just it isn't TOO far down.
---
Comic sans? WHY
---
There is a lot of whining about things that are non issues like layering CRBG's and using an updated client.
---
Good to know a *version of the game* is living rent free in some people's minds. It's obvious they feel threatened.
---
A higher level hunter ganking leveler warriors and a paladin with no intercept or blessing of freedom? Do you expect them to have engineering net or grenades? Lol
---
There isn't. It's just a handful of loud voices, but small in numbers.
---
i did rank14 on 1 of them a few years ago, that was enough of it... i want the real deal now :P and cant wait to log in
---
i just played through wc3 and its expansion in prep for wow vanilla again. i had played wc3 when it first came out but never really got into the lore. mostly just played multiplayer
---
No mortal strike you crazy
---
Check out kargoz if you haven't already. I really like him because he just seems so genuinely excited for the game. He doesnt pretend to be the best player but you can tell he puts a shit load of effort into the research for his videos.
---
That‚Äôs how it was 
---
Source: mained a warlock in vanilla
---
A higher level hunter should win this every single time, are you fucking stupid?
---
It's bitter sweet. I love questing along side Tauren Brethren so don't get me wrong but I'd never play one. Something about playing a furry skyscraper just doesn't appeal to me!
---
I agree generally, but based on some limited clips from this same run I've seen, he was reporting something pretty much any time he died. I think one was about aggro distance or something, cause a mob killed him while he was trying to find his way back through the dungeon. He's basically turning the bug reports into noise. Like when the testers I worked with started getting incentives to report bugs, so they reported everything they could and would fight tooth and nail when we'd return it as "working as intended" because that would wipe out their progress to the  bonus or whatever they got. 
---
So I might just be more sensitive to this nonsense.
---
No ms, no bs, its bad.
---
That's not true at all, he repeatedly uses the word "different" and admits basically he has to re-do his guides. But hey, go bitch some on reddit because you didn't get your beta inv.
---
Okay that was actually a good meme, +1
---
you caught me
---
May 2019 here, none yet. EU!
---
I appreciate your post and especially the information, but people should play the game how they want to play it. Some people get their rush and gamers high from rushing to the end, let em have their fun! I‚Äôm in your camp though, it‚Äôs much more enjoyable to me to explore and take my time.
---
&gt; Non-tryhard guilds will take people like shadow priests to raids
---
Nah. My guild in vanilla was casual and we still didn't take shadow priests, ret/prot paladins (except for one ret for BoK buff, but he still had to heal during fights), feral/balance druids, etc.
---
Casual guilds will already have a harder time defeating bosses, so why would they gimp themselves even more. Once they hit a brick wall because their healers are entirely OOM because they don't have enough DPS, people start getting salty if there are people doing less DPS than the tanks. Either the guild will force those people to respec or stop inviting them to raids (which is what my guild did), or eventually collapse due to raid drama and/or good raiders continually leaving.
---
Earth shock, my friend.
---
warcraftrealms is a decent guild archive site if you remember your own name
---
Ya gnome warriors wtf!? Trolls should have always been able to play druid frig they really should have that added.
---
I wouldn't have it any other way friend. You complete me.
---
haha
---
They just want your raid spot
---
[https://imgur.com/a/SpasWn8](https://imgur.com/a/SpasWn8)
---
removed the background for you
---
Classic won't fail, why? It's has already been validated and proven by private servers that it works, and people want it.
---
I just read somewhere that there is sharding/phasing is this true?
---
yea but they still wore mail and couldn't reliably generate threat
---
Totally forgot to mention him. His class guides are the best I've ever seen.
---
Very manageable to do if your definition of "competitive" is to be actively working on/completing top tier raid content. Pick a server/guild that raids on your timeline, many will do 2-4 raid nights a week (depending on available/new content), each raid usually last between 2-4 hours. Find a guild that starts raiding at a time that works for you, back in Vanilla my guild raided 7-X pm, doing farm content in the beginning of the week, and progression content at the end. There should be guilds out there that schedule to fit almost any lifestyle.
---
I‚Äôve been subbed from 04, plenty of on and off unsubbung, but I‚Äôve had my current one since BfA just to log in and fuck around here and there. Got in yesterday as a complete nobody. I‚Äôll do my best to report what I can!
---
Don‚Äôt be so sure.  I did exactly the same thing and for the exact same reasons, albeit back in MoP, and I got a day one beta invite.  Granted it may have something to do with the degree of participation, feedback, and content I generate during every Blizzard beta.
---
as if a 1v3 as hunter against 3 melee in water is supposed to be impressive
---
what a stupid fucking post
---
I was just using them as a bare minimum, ultimately it depends on everyone else on your server. Ideally people will get their rank 14 rewards and then back off their playtime so eventually 4-8 hours will be enough. Some people may just be dicks and hold onto rank 14 for months on end though.
---
Not if you want a life you aren't. That is the worst class to play if you plan on existing irl.
---
 They reboot the ~~matrix~~ game after every BFA incarnation. This the 33rd cycle.
---
This is what took hold of me the most in this game. Making friends by spending hours /1: LFG WC, need heals and 1 DPS, meeting compete strangers, gradually getting to know them, and struggling through the headaches to attain triumph. I made so many friends for several years on the game.   
---
Then raid/dungeon finder FUCKING RUINED IT
---
it's not the real deal , your character will be deleted
---
Yeah this is gross, no MS no imp hamstring.. Big YIKES
---
&gt;So... You know that arenas aren't a thing in vanilla, right?
---
Arena were a thing right before the TBC launched, the few people who played it apparently managed to correctly theorycraft the overpoweredness of rogue mage x combos.
---
However, the 2v2 3v3 etc scenarios I'm referring to are in bg settings. For example, in WSG, when both flags are captured, you will split up into different teams to defend or attack.
---
In AB, you will have different teams tasked with different nodes and objectives.
---
So despite being 10 v 10 or 15 v 15 in numbers, the vast majority of fights boil down to 5v5 or less. Even in AV, a rogue is only handicapped in zergs. They can pick off stragglers, ninja cap, cc during fights, and still contribute more than most classes.
---
&gt;Resilience as well.
---
I never said it was part of vanilla. Its absence in vanilla is why otherwise great classes can't compete against rogue mage in vanilla. The burst is just unmanageable.
---
If they do, they should at least call it Nostalrium or something, so people know if you refer to Nostalrius the Pserver or the new classic one.
---
No. Nobody said [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker].
---
i wasn't interested in playing Classic (or any WoW) until they announced the release date and now it's all i can think about. i think this is going to be bigger than anyone expects
---
no more annoying than these two screeching fucks
---
Man, I remember zoning into the Howling Fjord during the WotLk beta for the first time. I was in awe. I'm glad they a long boat ride from the time you zone in to the time you get docked. I allowed me to really soak in my surroundings and be amazed. 
---
I probably still have screenshots from that on an old hard drive. I'll have to look for it. 
---
That was my favorite WoW era. I had just hit 70 on my feral druid and was tanking heroics in TBC when I got into the beta. Such a fun time in my life.
---
I think your want to look at your approach for time spent playing, I have full time job, a wife and kid, so I think its about maximizing your game time, Are you a competitive player at heart? If so I think you will be fine, I still intend to raid but not at the level when i was in college and my Raid schedule was priority it will now have to be secondary. you might want to focus on being a reliable Alt raider in a hardcore guild, or just find a more casual guild with a schedule that fits. You'll be able to make something work you'll just need to find out what it is.
---
There are 2 players not 3.
---
It just feels like a way to purposely exclude returning players. Of which, I imagine there are a lot coming back for Classic.
---
I know that personally, Cataclysm ran me off. I've not played since then. I am interested in Classic though. But I'm not willing to drop $15 for a chance to Beta test a fifteen year old game.
---
This is so good.
---
I really hope you‚Äòre speaking the trutru.
---
&gt; True, but you'd have to spend time to even find tip-worthy indie movies.
---
We have already established that the majority of people who use twitch do not watch exclusively high viewership streamers. If they didn't small streamers would not exist.
---
HAHHAAHHA dude look at it. It's the same guy. One is from 10 hours ago from now, and one from 5 hours ago. The dude posted 10 hours ago, came back 5 hours ago and saw his post, then replied to it not realizing it was himself, and argues with himself.
---
I know that :D
---
I played since TBC release until end of wotlk. Then the last half of Cata because of school, but super casual that I rarely raided and the LFR was kind of welcoming for me but also I thought that it sucked :p
---
Played MoP for like 2 weeks at the end like you, started WoD, actually had a blast playing with my best friend. leveling was awesome, Highmaul and BRF was so much fun. BRF is one of my most loved raids since. We stopped after so we never experienced the insane content drought. We started with Legion release, played to 110 Demon Hunter, was fun, and then I quit, literally 1 month in :D and then bfa release and I got sucked in, played to mid December and got fucked up by the game so much :p
---
Lol that's awesome
---
My first US server (Deathwing) it was called DM when I was leveling (way before Dire Maul).
---
I'm sorry.
---
Healed from wrath to Legion. Finally a DPS in BfA and I enjoy the change of pace it brought me. I'll stick with pure dps for Classic. Thanks for confirming lol
---
A company as big as Blizzard doesn't simply go for one time cash grabs though.  Everything they create is created with a mindset of long-term profit. 
---
In the end the consumer, with their wallet, decides which way a (successful) business goes.  Unfortunately, peoples wallets have been voting for what retail wow has become.  Now that retail subs have been dwindling and there is demand for vanilla, the consumers are deciding that classic servers is a direction that Blizzard should take, in such that the consumers are showing that there is potential for long term profit (Recapturing Dwindling Subs/TBC/Post Naxx/etc),
---
Macespec dual-wield warrior, I see.
---
Just go 2H mace mortal strike and spam improved hamstring if you wanna fish for a stun. Especially effective with a WF totem nearby if you're horde.
---
Still ok stun chance, TuF stuns aswell, hamstring can immobilize, still have mortal strike for extra burst potential and heal reduction.
---
Cool your jets, bro
---
you could probably tank most 5 man content, but it will require substantially more effort from not only the shaman, but the rest of the group as well
---
Exactly, this kids a fucking moron.
---
That is good news!
---
"The Green Hills of Go Fuck Yourself"  
---
Win
---
I'd totally forgotten about that.
---
I am so damn excited to re-discover all of this stuff.
---
why does this matter?
---
When do you train your imp with better armor/stats/abilities?
---
Thats good that you have looked into it, just be aware that you may need to wait until the true no lifers are done their grind since they don't even have jobs and can play 14+ hours every day. After that initial rush it should be more attainable with enough commitment though.
---
as a future rogue, I'm concerned about the grass moving thing. I mean, if I vanish in STV and the grass gives away my position, I'm easily prone to a blizzard or any aoe spell. I don't have anything against people using the "higher" graphics settings, but at least make stealth not interactive with the decorative grass around. As long as new the essence of the vanilla is kept, and no new mechanics or whatever might appear change how the spells and pvp used to work, I don't really give a fk what you see on your screen.
---
I can‚Äôt understand why people judge anything in the starting zone. 
---
No one has ever paid any attention to numbers one to six seriously have they? It‚Äôs the blast through this easy part and it doesn‚Äôt actually get difficult until 8-10 when you can accidentally pull two mobs and not have the abilities to deal with it. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm loving the beta so far and can‚Äôt wait for classic to drop in August. A few bugs here and there we‚Äôll sort out. This is gonna be amazing.
---
Stop posting this shit. No one cares
---
The 2v2+ involves mostly bgs scenarios. For example, WSG isn't actually 10 v 10 in terms of team fights of 10 v 10. It's often far smaller skirmishes between small groups of players. Same with AB. The objectives for a team to break up instead of zerg, and a coordinated team of rogue and mage thrive in these smaller fights.
---
There are EU people playing aswell, the beta has two realms and it's being played by everyone. The problem is that they only allow a very small amount of people every or every other day. So it will take time for us to get in.
---
omg the rumors lul, someone made a youtube "joke video" about ho they were going to kill him and his family and he got spooked and reported it... please know the full story if you're going to post about it
---
We all wanted wow with vanilla design philosophies
---
Well I saw no photos for ya so i took one but i didn't use all options sorry duder.
---
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD haHAA
---
Nobody cares.
---
Also you said this :  I just really suggest you go in blind, it will be more enjoyable. You wont be server first 60 but you will have memories to last a lifetime.
---
Why should he have to know everything then?
---
The hate boner for Twitch streamer is getting out of hand. Jesus Christ, relax dude
---
Unless they go pve
---
... no it isn't.
---
What's this beaten corpse?
---
esfand is way less annoying than them yes
---
No it's a full lie. I watched the stream and he basically said "Oh wow, so my imp has 7 hp, makes sense. It's way harder than I thought, I gotta keep grinding to update my guides".  
---
I don't care about Kargoz nor other streamers, but this subreddit is full of idiots trying to undermine those guys like Tips and Kargoz.
---
Now stop lying for nothing, it has no sense and gets you nowhere,
---
The worst part is that wod raids were actually incredible, it's just that there were so few and we had so little to do with garrisons.
---
Soda is a drink and I don‚Äôt know the patch schedule either.
---
Honestly Classic WoW has made me realize that I do in fact hate streaming culture now.
---
wow, this sub got pretty serious all of a sudden eh. I thought it was pretty hilarious that the biggest classic streamer doesnt even know what is happening post launch
---
Its the forseeable trend that kind of thing represents. Its 100% going to get annoying.
---
Get this garbage post out of here
---
Organized chaos is still chaos
---
This is just nostalgia talking, these flavors are no where near as good as all the people think they were. There is a heavy revisionist history about these flavors and people can't get past it. After a month or so everyone is just going to go back to drinking Baja Blast once they realize this
---
Did somebody say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\] ?
---
I feel that because I tried em I get to relearn the game. Kinda like forgetting parts of your favorite movie and watching it all over again.
---
All these news of "harden and slower than private servers" just make me grin in anticipation.
---
Thanks, the page I was looking at only went back to 2011. Turns out I had a free month 27/01/2005!
---
so what? I don't like soda but at least he's actually good at vanilla
---
no you are just retarded
---
Or just play however you like.
---
I enjoy spamming dungeons while leveling. Some people don't.
---
It's fine man, just let people be themselves. We can choose to do whatever we want.
---
That's the beautiful thing.
---
It was funny watching him get his mind blown by how different it was to private servers. He couldn‚Äôt even handle it.
---
And can it really be called PvP without getting ganked? I don't think so.
---
It all makes sense. The Titans. The Void Lords. They all come from the masters of the truest and purest power in the universe: Coin. The creators and controllers of time and space itself.
---
After all, time is money, friend!
---
I think classic is good for all wow fans. It brings people to the game that want to experience what it was like and some of those people will check out retail too and vice versa. The hype is bringing people back to the game which is good for all of us. 
---
In regards to classic being better, it's hard to say it's better outright. It is different and more of an investment of time and difficulty in gameplay. Retail has a lot more content but an easier gameplay experience. Sometimes it's nice to just crank out some dungeons and raids on retail.
---
I think nostalgia clouds a lot of our opinions. I am  hyped for classic and having fun watching the streams right now but I can see myself enjoying retail with friends for mythic + and old content as well.
---
I'm maliciously praying for somebody to ring the gong at like 3 am and fuck over all the other people going for scarab lord. 
---
I also definitely think theres some rose tinted goggles going into the Ahn Qirag grind. It is going to be a *motherfucker*.
---
May I ask why fishing is so great in vanilla?
---
As a horde main back in vanilla, I solo cleared this place over 10 times in a row, wtf these streamers on about?
---
Of course I was using my friend's account while double boxing with my lvl 19 rogue twink. If I recall correctly, I could leave my rogue at the entrance and still be able to masterloot him at the sweet gear. Such good times.
---
I think I did stop earlier in August but I logged in to open my mail before my subscription terminated. I shouldn't have been so greedy for those AH profits!
---
Get a life please
---
They all get their hardons by trying to min max everything.  You should watch the first 20 mins of Asmon and Esfand lol, its fucking pathetic.  
---
They wine about how they should not have setup keybinds and the UI first because they got behind the leveling curve... FML.
---
At least I could play for free and raidlog in WoD though. Personally I hated the story (time travel/multiverse is a copout), but it was the last time I raided because 1) 15 minutes a day paid for my sub and 2) I didn't have to grind fucking world quests over and over in order to be a fully competent Mythic raider.
---
It was also easy to level and increasing my garrison gold finally gave me the impetus to level every class to the current cap, which had been a vague goal of mine since Cata.
---
From a non-individual perspective that gold influx was terrible for the game's health, but oh well ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø it kept me playing up until I killed M Archimonde.
---
I cannot understand how Blizzard have not manually flagged his account. 
---
Mind blowing.
---
Please do correct me if I'm wrong, but I swear around 6.0-6.1 the old models were untouched while we had also had the new models. Many private servers allow mods/patches for HD models, and these are largely fine with a only a few bugs that could probably be ironed out by a full on dev team who wanted the option to be available. The old models only started suffering changes to their animations when they started overhauling class animations in late WoD and Legion.
---
No one can confirm.
---
&gt;¬†(how many people do you think have resubbed to try and get beta access?)
---
Honestly? Tens of thousands, which is such a relatively small bump that it won't even be noteworthy in the next quarterly report.
---
Until they hit level 12, like how it always was.
---
@ you and /u/zigfried555
---
LFG was added in the Burning Crusade pre-patch (2.0.1). It was *not* added in vanilla, unless you‚Äôre being pedantic, because it was at the very end of Vanilla and gave new content leading into TBC. It definitely didn‚Äôt exist in patch 1.12.
---
There's a thread for this in the sidebar.
---
Bitch, im farming BIS gear every 5 level.
---
Agreed. You can barely say anything around here without being told you‚Äôre wrong and downvoted. Unless you post unoriginal memes or pictures of your game boxes and discs, that‚Äôs always successful.
---
you didn't know shit - you just took "slipper slope" theory and put into a paragraph.
---
I refer to this as my special brand of Shaman Feign Death.
---
Shaman are much more convincing than Hunters.
---
Which is why they snagged King in the first place
---
What should people be posting about?
---
Wtf. Why the hostility?
---
having a bunch of random people take over your server out of nowhere is the worst.  transfers suck
---
Eh, if he was really not considered someone who should represent the classic community by a lot of people he wouldn't have gotten an invite to Blizzard HQ. Fact is he tricked a lot of people into thinking he knows the game...
---
Fwiw I will happily nitpick them all day, and there are many areas they could be better in. But I can't get over the massive leap in fidelity they offer. Every time I see my old tauren from preWoD I recoil in horror and wonder how I put up with it for so long. But it's all personal taste.
---
Really bro? wow
---
it shows as PTR. if you see a new one pop up you didn't have before it's likely the beta
---
That diet stuff is actually more toxic than mcconnel
---
Hence my comment. Pvp went to shit lol
---
Unfortunately they walk like their spine is a broomstick\^\^
---
Nice try Blizzard
---
It's known as harpooning.
---
Nost got the movement off the ground it is undeniable. You can stick your head in the sand if you want, but the shutdown of that server went mainstream and started the movement that lead us here.
---
You forgot the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also streamer, I have 10 followers on twitch‚Äù
---
I hated cross-realm BGs. I was horde on Garona which was heavily pop imbalanced in favor of Alliance so my queues weren't ever the worst so I get why some want them but they really undermined a core intangible feature of the game. I knew or at least recognized and communicated with many enemy players over a long period of time and that gave substance to the games fundamental premise, a great war between two factions. Cross-realm turns that core aspect of the game into, imho at least, a simple monotonous gimmick.
---
He's saying at launch there was no rp pvp servers, but we are also going straight into patch 1.12.1 so what happened on "launch" doesn't matter. Only progression-based things like how gear got a little better with each raid release shouldn't be in the game immediately.
---
Johntravoltapulpfiction.gif
---
For those who don't get it... Deadmines was known as VC or VanCleef because back then, of course, you had to spam trade to find a group, and Dire Maul was known as DM.
---
This was also not really much of an issue on Horde side because VC was mostly considered an Alliance dungeon since the time and effort needed to travel there was really not worth it.
---
Why wasn't cataclysm fun for you?
---
I'm guessing these people have never played vanilla? You never loss your combo points on a target unless you used a combo point generating ability on another target.
---
It's a great way to discourage combat looting :(
---
Dwarf melee hunter so that I can trounce rogues like I used to back on the day.
---
I honestly hope Blizzard errs of the side of making EVERYTHING harder. BFA is for faceroll content. (outside of mythic raiding &amp; Mythic +++ of course).
---
Fair enough, it's just the wording of your comments makes it seem like you're referring to arenas  because you mention a bunch of arbitrary figures which just happen to coincide with arena numbers.
---
A lot of people are in for a shock when classic actually launches :)
---
Then he tried to 1v1 asmon multiple times after that and lost every time.  Stupid kids trying to stream snipe.
---
Its 1000% more worth it to play with your friends tbh, even if you love paladins. 
---
The only reason to roll the other faction would be to make a rogue, outlevel them, and camp them relentlessly.  
---
But that novelty would wear off.  
---
You should try shaman if you like holy paladin.  Resto Shamans are really strong in vanilla, even though the experience isn't that similar.
---
I think he meant hard to avoid getting bored and quitting before finishing the level grind.
---
It's also a beta with a limited number of people. I hard doubt they would've been world first if the general population actually got a go...
---
Are you me? But legion was a blast I also popped in for that.
---
Wrong
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP?oldid=452386
---
That's from 2007.
---
I think the length of the beta will lead to the game being dead on release as all the twitch viewers will have burned out vicariously.
---
This is my deciding factor on Ally or Horde. The Winterspring Frostsaber grind.
---
"I'm a content creater"

People aren't going to slow down. We all know what WoW is and was like. You kill some creatures and do some quests, get experience. Yes, it works fundamentally better in Classic and feels more rewarding. But there's no way people aren't going to just rush to 60 like they try to now. We've all experience leveling in WoW a million times,  Classic makes it a little different, but let's be honest here. We've experienced all these zones, hell most of them are unchanged or very little changes on what retail is. There's zones in retail I've barely experienced, and have no intention to slow down and smell the roses just because I'm less familiar with it. 
---
I played in Wrath, so I've experienced  the world pre-Cataclysm. I remember hating leveling so much. I hated it. Funny thing is, I enjoy leveling now that I'm older. I find it relaxing, so I'm going to absolutely love the slow and more rewarding Classic Leveling. I'm going to love it. But, I'm not going to slow down. Leveling as fast as possible is fun to me. Getting things accomplished is fun to me. That doesn't mean I'm not going to stop and interact with other players every once in awhile, maybe do a dungeon here and there. Work on professions when I get bored. But, I am definitely skipping all the quest text, and trying to get the quests done as fast as possible and move from zone to zone. That's just the World of Warcraft experience. Classic or Retail. People act like just because Classic is fundamentally better, people need to treat it like a brand new game. It's not though. That's just going to disappoint everyone when they realize - "Oh, this Night Elf starting zone is basically just like in Retail. I literally just did this a week ago. Some things are different, but it feels the same." 
---
You're putting way too much expectations on people by telling them that the leveling is amazing. That doesn't mean I don't agree and will probably like the leveling experience more, but let's be honest here. Grinding through quests was never **THAT** fun or special. This is coming from someone who **LOVED** the game when I started playing, but **hated** questing. Like I said though, I do appreciate and enjoy questing now and will **prefer** Classic Questing for the change of pace.
---
Yes you‚Äôll be fine. You probably won‚Äôt get rank 14, but you‚Äôll be able to go far.
---
Imagine thinking you can do anything about hamstring at level 20.
---
Or... you know. Let regular people in. :)
---
How dare a corporation try to make money from the people who want its products. That‚Äôs obscene. 
---
They‚Äôre not forcing anyone to do anything, and they‚Äôre not lying - they said you need a sub to play the game, that‚Äôs a fair thing to say.
---
Great post - I hope a lot of the newcomers to vanilla read this, I've seen quite a lot of people here these past days asking for detailed guides, etc for beginners, this is all they need :)
---
I mean.. with updates maybe? Jagex also brought back RuneScape classic for a while with no updates, and eventually had to shut it down because game breaking bugs messed it up beyond repair.
---
MY JUNGLE LOVE

JUNGLE LOVE

---
Played Nost and I think it was worth it. Quit once the Black Lotus shortage hit. Have a bad feeling that may happen in Classic, and I'm on the fence about actually playing.
---
Those bullet points are not the samr checkmarks as in vanilla, worst change ever
---
My names Jeff.
---
&gt; Lol, I feel like these softies from retails are not prepared for the kind of wpvp that existed in classic.
---
this is really all the kind of wpvp there really is left in retail.
---
tips getting completely and utterly assblasted
---
Haha yeah not a bad idea either :)
---
https://mountaindew.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Fuel_Promotion#2019.C2.A0Release
---
might be different but there is a red one so idk if it tastes the same.  looks like there were a lot of random promos throughout the years though.  can't say i've actively looked at mountain dew at the grocery store so i've never seen it
---
I never played WoW until a friend introduced me to it on nostalrius. Have been playing on private servers since
---
Yet people are still too embarrassed to admit they actually play RuneScape.
---
It doesn't exist on the server because the person with it hasn't logged in yet. That's why you did it right after reset.
---
After this was discovered i knew guilds that abused it for 3 weeks. After that it was fixed.
---
Just stop watching all these losers... go do something productive with yourselves..! I know people dig streaming and are gonna be upset but Jesus Christ at a certain point someone just needs to say it. Watching someone else game for any extended amount of time is fucking pathetic.
---
Nice bit of bigotry there. reported.
---
Don't you need like 8 warlocks for it to be worth it over literally any other dps?
---
surew
---
Found the Blizzard PR guy.
---
Except when he got the cops involved over a youtube comment
---
no, you dont. your account will be flagged even if you're not subscribed but in order to play after you received beta you need to have an active sub.
---
Great post. Amen!
---
Imagine thinking Asmongold is entertaining.
---
Whew, glad you agree! Meldaron and his bro make some decent content too. I think the people who are genuinely excited about the game come off better than people like tips. He has always come across as someone doing it for the money/popularity‚Äîjust my opinion tho.
---
You've overlooked the fact there's a level 59 in the group.
---
Why is there some much dick riding for streamers when people talk shit about them? Streamers are useless assholes that embody the worst stereotypes of gamers, yet the counter jerk is so hard that people defend their bullshit.
---
They usually get a budged from online casinos as a way to promote gambling to their audience.
---
Hah! Not bad
---
No beta here either. Started my account 12/26/2004.
---
I was more of a Bongos man myself.
---
There are actually lots of pathing bugs in beta right now. I have been reporting them as I run into them. Probably the most obvious thing I've seen (just mobs doing weird back and forth zigzags etc.)
---
The only thing I remember it doing was map coordinates so that thottbot info meant something.
---
If they do it when the game goes live, people will be PISSED and force them to change it.
---
They implemented layering specifically for player experience.  
---
They implemented a form of sharding specifically so a player's experience  doesn't revolve around dead servers or waiting for mobs to spawn.  
---
They implemented layering as the form of sharding to cater specifically to those who were against sharding as it is in retail for the breakdown in immersion when players pop in and out of your view constantly.
---
Yeah its actually really sad imo
---
What is low acid coffee and how do I get it?!?
---
tbf, the same thing can be said about a fair amount of people on this sub.
---
Just play what you want to play.  That can be one, the other, both, or neither.
---
Reset all instances was usually the way people went.
---
I don't think anything screams midlife crisis more than the sound of 'Diet GameFuel' haha. 
---
That said... I'd probably buy the shit out of it. Every time I drink that cherry mountain dew I remember these bottles. I'd be all over them again in a heartbeat.
---
D2:LoD is still up and running, but probably about 95% bots somehow. Don't make public games, several bots will join every minute and spam the chat with ads for items. Pretty much all Baal runs are ran by Hammerdin bots, or at least they were last time I checked a couple of years ago.
---
Clearly not if people that subbed yesterday got in.
---
absolutely not lol
---
I‚Äôm saying he didn‚Äôt remember it to be like that as it was 15 years ago when vanilla was a thing so that‚Äôs why he reported it not saying he was right
---
Yeah that's nice and all but since the beta the entire sub has been infested with #changes people.
---
Yeah, it gets a little excessive. I appreciate the passion for the game, but I think our memories are all messed up from Pservers and the fifteen year gap and what not. There‚Äôs some obvious glaring stuff we‚Äôll get sorted out but some of the stuff I‚Äôm hearing about has me rolling my eyes from time to time. But hey, maybe I should just let the perfectionists and Uber min-maxers do their thing.
---
Is the damage and other combat text that pops up what it looks like in Retail? Will there be an option to set that to Vanilla style? Because that text style does not seem to fit the aesthetic of WoW in my opinion.
---
Have they confirmed if battleground exp gain can be toggled off yet?  I forget when the added the abillity to opt out of BG exp.
---
And why is that? Whats wrong with a little bit of quality of life improvements?
---
It was 3 am and he kept saying how he was excited but just tired af
---
3/26/2005 here, hope I get an invite!
---
I‚Äôve only once seen a dude level on a shockadin. Looked fun if not a little inefficient. He loved it tho so thats what matters
---
Think freezing trap is 20 if he'd had his trap out.  If the warrior catches you unawares there's not much to be done for it at that level.
---
What the heck is Underworld?
---
Crazy to think of how long ago that actually was huh? Lol
---
Wasn't this the dude who was stream sniping another hunter and ended up dieing during the gank last night.  Dude raged in his chat for a few minutes.
---
That was the case in Vanilla, IIRC. The linked images seem to be pulling from retail lore, which has suffered quite a few retcons over the past 13 years. Starting with the whole Eredar -&gt; mutant space goats nonsense in TBC.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpsqge/cs_manager_answers_about_the_beta_access/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Seems to conflict with that they have claimed.
---
Well, guess I‚Äôll check my account and pray lol
---
hunters don't fall off in higher tier gear.
---
They start strong, plateau, and then get REALLY freaking strong again.
---
BUT you have to hit a certain threshold where your personal dps for changing spec will make up for the NOT having the group synergy your other spec gave.
---
I 100% agree this sub is a trashfire, but I‚Äôm cold and find a lot of it funny lol
---
If you dislike it so much why do you keep watching?
---
He deleted his post but yeah, he's as pig-headed and as dense as they come.
---
Should be able to turn that on in the interface
---
Yes. But the point is nothing inherently prevents them from commiting to and achieving their goals.
---
I find it EXTREMELY hard to believe that most people will burn themselves out by watching twitch streamers, considering people have played the same game for 10+ years, and very few are actually watching twitch for hours and hours every day.
---
Shit you're serious
---
Some opinions are so funny how they work.
---
Wasn't Tips adamant on the stance that right click report shouldn't be in the game?
---

GREAT post. Thank you for taking the time to type all of that out. As someone that has been away since WotLK, I'd say that I forgot about 60% of this. SO looking forward to the journey.
---
Thanks again for the gear tips! Going to save this post!
---
To be fair, they weren‚Äôt necessarily speaking out of their ass.
---
Not saying that it isn‚Äôt possible, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any actual proof of people without a sub getting into the beta.
---
Each class, spec, and role all have their good and their bad aspects to them. I suggest just looking at them all and making you're choice based on it.
---
I know its not the most helpful but I feel like that's the only way to look at it.
---
The hunter with the elements shoulders really does it for me
---
Oily blackmouth, winter squid and nightfin snapper are raid materials.
---
Do you know why it‚Äôs not possible? I thought classic was running on the modern client?
---
I think the streamers will burn out, especially the variety ones, before the beta is over.
---
Same! I was surprised actually, I thought I had gotten in later than I did (couldn't get to a store on launch day) but I was actually in the day after launch. I can also see the moment my mom realized I had used her credit card to sub, because my payment method suddenly changes to game time cards XD
---
Haven‚Äôt fish always been raid materials technically though?  For feasts and shit
---
Sitting in Thunder Bluff listening to the music and watching as the sky turns darker.
---
why would I pay 15 bucks to play classic when i can get it for free on a private server?
---
They‚Äôve been streaming the game hours a day for years and years, plus they‚Äôre getting paid. This will never happen.
---
World pvp.
---
^Under appriciated comment rite dere.
---
didnt use a ui tool until like tbc for auras
---
Warlock was at its greatest during TBC.
---
I'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way.
---
What about Strathholme or Scholomance? The two dungeons in east and west plaugelands. Or were they not at the start?
---
Corpsemaker is a 2h axe, not a polearm I'm pretty sure
---
I have no fuckin idea dude
---
Having a sense of community above all. The current game is vapid as hell.
---
Fair enough haha, thanks for the reply!
---
Well you just have to think about what you want to do in the end game.  Do you just specifically want to find raid groups and be consistently invited?  Are you always there for raid times?  If that's what you want to do then the best option IMO is to roll a dps class that is needed but only in small amounts.  
---
For example, hunters.  Leveling as a hunter is awesome, so there it will fit your criteria for fun leveling.  Also, when it comes time for raid, if you find a guild you are consistent with they will ALWAYS need a hunter.  And honestly there aren't *too* many hunters per raid either so competition for loot will be minimal when a hunter piece drops.
---
Besides that idk man just do what you will find the funnest and roll with it.
---
Hey, any luck getting in yet? On a F&amp;F, still waiting.
---
Cause of all the server down-time.
---
Layering.
---
I don't agree with transmogs or quality of life improvements, but I do agree with expanding content with the same values as vanilla. Another raid or outdoor content or something like that.
---
Stop spamming your guild recruitment shit in this sub
---
I'm sorry about the confusion, I can see why you interpreted that way.
---
It's like slowfall but faster
---
.... are you the same Skorch from Malice on Altar of Storms? 
---
Long time no see, it‚Äôs me, Alexx‚Äôs brother
---
Awesome, thanks! I'll check them out now and if they aren't streaming I'll see if the have any videos recorded on twitch.
---
Life?
---
If you can log in you have an active subscription, and thus are eligible for beta.
---
It's not like the only guilds that will be available to join ever will be the ones that form at the very start. There will always be new guilds forming and starting progression.
---
Honestly the harder they are the better this scrub tipsout knows nothing about what a real mmo is like and sodapoppin also already making the case he might not stick around for classic if his subscriber base doesn't want to be a part of it. So if it wasn't for the exposure they wouldn't be playing it.
---
I loved cata, mop was the last ok expansion but it was a marketing ploy from the start
---
Shaman had the grace of air totem that provided + agility. It was an air totem just like the windfury totem so you could only use one at a time. 
---
However since the windfury buff lasted 10 seconds (I think) you could do what was called "totem twisting" where you dropped the windfury totem for the buff, then dropped your agility totem till you needed to reapply windfury.
---
The same crooks do who sell drugs for some time until it gets quite hot and they know eventually they must be targeted: they diversify.
---
You rake in the money, invest that money and reap the benefits.
---
That's why law enforcement often targets "honest" aspects of the economy like restaurants, real estate and the likes. The money got laundered and now is good money you can keep making money off without ever going into crime again.
---
I‚Äôll spend 5 minutes setting up an action bar addon on initial launch because I value having my action bars in a naga config only have to bind my keys once then I‚Äôm good to go. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt whine even if I had to use default bar for first 10-20 lvls.
---
I started leveling there when ZG was introduced.... The horror... But I still remember those times very fondly. Can't wait for August, it'll be epic!
---
Funny, a few days ago I found an email from 2011 I sent to Blizz requesting vanilla and tbc servers. I dont even remember doing it
---
*layered*
---
Yikes, see that's a different story. That is very unfortunate.
---
In case you aren‚Äòt a troll: ‚Äûkeeping the game fresh‚Äú and ‚Äûquality of life improvements‚Äú were the reason for wow‚Äòs downfall. We enjoy wow classic exactly for what it is, with all its flaws and goodies.
---
No heirloom and forced slow pace leveling.
---
Communuty.
---
Personally (Yes, it is just an opinion you are likely not agree with) I would say that raid healing is probably the second fun thing you could do. 
---
Warrior DPS &gt; Priest healing &gt;= Druid healing on BWL+ content) &gt; Rogue DPS &gt; Tanking &gt; Rest classes DPS and Heals.
---
warrior charge still cancels fall damage?
---
Just out of curiosity; why would you "If I want to know something in game I will ask someone in game."
---
Like I totally get the whole "reading quest text and not reading any websites", but I feel like asking someone in-game is counter-intuitive to that idea, since most people will utilize online resources to find out.
---
Its not like they took the fights at the same time either. I'm not saying Asmongold and Esfand are the best at pvp, (tbh idk) but mocking them makes no sense.  They are better than most for sure.
---
Jesus christ dude just go to the discord or something, no one wants to join your weird RP guild with a strange as fuck membership interview process.
---
"Duskwood: The Mor'Ladim Chain", it's literally 3 talk-to-npc-Quests followed by killing one elite.
---
YEsterday on Asmon's stream he said there was going to be RP servers, so RPPvP is also a no brainer
---
IIRC he didn't even reach 60, right? How can he claim to be a top warrior in anything
---
Rogue is, but like 75% of people will be playing Rogue
---
weird flex but ok
---
Who is this?
---
Did this last night and a shammy tanked it. It was awesome
---
 warrior charge still cancels fall damage right? they can charge from mid air if you are close enough
---
Cataclysm was so bad it caused me to quit.
---
What exactly do you mean by viable?  What is your end goal for classic?  Do you just want to raid?  Pvp?
---
My friends are having a hard-on for wanting to play Horde, even though they were ally for vanilla, and have been playing horde on Pservers.
---
They can fuck off, I'm leveling a night elf warrior all over again and I'll murder em if I gotta
---
Feral is not in a good place in vanilla as far as PVE is concerned, but rogue is strong :)
---
Running dungeons with randoms, adding them to my friends list if the run went smoothly and then continuously playing with them as we leveled up. It also turns into a competition of sorts to see who levels up faster.
---
Same. I remember after eventually hitting 60 that an addon called quest helper existed and I thought I was cheating.
---
I'm probably just overthinking it tbh.
---
Watched the clip of his imp dieing. 
---
Can confirm I detected no crying. He was just observing the obvious differences between private servers and classic wow. But hey, lets just shit on all streamers because we think that makes us cool right?
---
Arrest this man.
---
Many of the bugs are world and mob behavior bugs. While there are class bugs there is just as much testing surface area in world behavior.
---
Keep in mind that a lot of class bugs go multiple WoW expansions without being fixed. Stuff like "this random spider's poison ability is ticking 10x more than the tooltip says" are generally higher priority bug fixes than, say, fixing Blink or Charge, which have always had serious bugs since the original WoW beta. Anything that displaces a character runs into fundamental issues with the way WoW works and how its anti cheat works, hence why even abilities like Shadowstep and Fel Rush will often cause disconnects and client crashes. 
---
Besides, just playing the game helps QA. If 1000 people do a quest and 2 people find and report bugs with that quest, knowing that it has a .2% reported failure rate with a statistically significant denominator helps a lot.
---
Yeah they do man. Been posted on the sub a few times today.
---
pressing the buttons so that my character does stuff in the game
---
If you mean dps, rogue is a lot more reliable. Easy, fun, and good. The only problem is that there will be lots of rogues.
---
Feral dps requires a lot of effort and farming just to reach "ok" levels of damage.
---
However, if you really like feral, just go for it. It's one of the "softer" hybrid dps specs. Not as bad as some others, and certainly not as bad as people will tell you.
---
That's about raids by the way. If your focus is on other stuff just play what you like the most.
---
There‚Äôs a reason they were phased to keep blood pact
---
We're generally removing circle-jerk posts, or posts mostly focusing on r/wow and their opinions of r/classicwow / Classic. So, this post is being removed. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Meeting my future 600 lbs wife.
---
600 lbs is 272.4 kg
---
Is that English? I‚Äôm being sarcastic, but what I‚Äôm basically saying is yes rogue is good in classic, but a lot of people are going to be playing rogue.
---
He never hit 60 in actual vanilla and admitted to it. Was power leveled in the winter on a PS. Even his 60 screenshot while being mob tagged. He's with three fanboys. Only hit 60 ONCE 15 years later.
---
So most of us already know all the Vanilla encounters and bosses, it would be cool if they expanded Molten Core or the other dungeons, you know what I mean? Maybe extra bosses scattered around the world.
---
Also little things like Barber shop and Transmog wouldn't affect the game at all, and you wouldnt have to use it if you didnt want to. Big deal.
---
getting xp in battlegrounds didnt exist untill Wrath iirc except for killing like rams in av

Hahaha, yep, same here. I got Vanilla maybe a month after launch so I was a little behind the curve...buddy from school said to get Cosmos. 
---
I was used to Diablo II where anything third party was gonna get you banned (well, if they found you, which was pretty unlikely based on my experiences with mh). Asked like 10 people before taking the plunge.
---
I think there‚Äôs some things retail can learn from classic to be a better game. In my oppinion the modern wow gear system needs to be tossed out. Also invalidating content with the next raid is an issue that I personally have with modern wow.
---
one loves blizzard and one hates blizzard.
---
&gt;These days I'm gonna have to sacrifice some of my gearing pace to 'adulting'. Makes me worried guilds just won't take interest.
---
So are most people. There are more than enough players with lives that can't NEET 24/7. As long as you're willing to learn the fights and what you need, you'll gear up.
---
I was beeing sarcastic too. Also im on mobile. :)
---
originally i spent like 6-8 months getting to 60 but it was my 1st mmo so there was that ... and i spent a good month in wsg too
---
A lot of the class quests for 20 and 30 were meant to be done over the course of the the next 10 or so levels.
---
That's why most of the level 20 class quests award level 30 items and the level 30 warrior quest awards a level 42 weapon.
---
they were also hints for where you could try questing next if you were stuck.
---
Honestly, idk why people are so upset about no unarmored mounts. Sure I can see that it would be a cool cosmetic reward for ppl going hardcore early on, but it just seems so unimportant, like the talisman of binding shard. There's plenty of stuff dedicated players will be able to show off to separate themselves. I'm just glad I get to play Classic in 3 months.
---
God I miss those. Somewhere in my room I have a set of the [Chinese WoW x Coke promotion cards](https://i.imgur.com/Qy4ydca.png) that are pretty cool looking.
---
Dont forget to report everything that isnt a bug and then instead of testing the game just meme around and irritate all the people wanting to see what about vanilla has changed from private servers

Summoning noobs to Wailing Caverns as a Warlock.
---
I started a hashtag @mountaindew for the fuck of it. #BringBackWoWGamerFuel
---
https://twitter.com/pan0phobik/status/1129429313995063297
---
Maybe make this hashtag big enough that they comply and put out a limited release at least?
---
Smart move lol
---
Hopefully that means the next xpac will be good then lol. I bought a physical BfA CE, yet I don't really regret it because the book and medallion thing are pretty cool. Plus, the box looks cool at least lmao.
---
good input, glad you cleared this up.
---
literally never did this in vanilla. i'm gonna have to check it out.
---
While leveling I‚Äôm not too sure, only because you need pretty specific pieces of gear and all your abilities. We had a shaman in my nostalrius guild that would tank UBRS (10 man) flawlessly. Those runs were some of the most memorable! Good luck.
---
Yeah I thought this was common knowledge. Dude was in the right place at the right time to be where he is now.
---
Thanks so much. Did some further research based on the link you sent me and I'm still at a loss. Some sources say that it's still available, while Mtn Dew's website doesn't list it. It's a mystery!
---
While I don't drink many soft drinks these days, the ones I still love on rare occasion are Mtn Dew's different flavors. Voltage and Livewire are so good.
---
To be fair, I played since vanilla and have no idea what cosmos was.
---
Granted I didn‚Äôt start using addons till wotlk and I was younger than 10 when I started playing in vanilla.
---
Here is a simple reason why i don't like pots - i won't complain but i know you crutch. 
---
The amount of time i had the excuse of "i didnt have x item" - i always world pvp without items unless opponent uses. This makes all encounters so much more satisfying since everyone does pot.
---
"decent" he makes more than your whole family combined broski, "decent".
---
Rogue beats paladin....interesting
---
that‚Äôs a mix if 2 of my favourite names ever Brad and Rand
---
We don't have any of this info.
---
I remember you, Zaziel. And I remember Hellmage and Xer (played a female warlock, I believe).
---
I mainly hung out with the guys like Smokinggun and Apally, and Penzdragon.
---
For the life of me, I cannot remember what my name was on there, but I played a Holy Paladin ‚Äî I think I used Kenoko, but I could be wrong.
---
Evidence of this please?
---
He should have been prepared, I mean he obviously knew asmond was coming, doesn't even bother to use traps, bonus points for him crying about traps not working despite it just being the normal arming time they had back then.
---
We always just had the hunter run and feign when we were ready to kill Drakkisath.
---
I'll proudly wear my Nostalrius T-shirt on august 27th!
---
I'm aiming at full prot (Warrior, goes without saying). If I'm gonna push to tank Classic I want to do it right. I'm glad that even on the *undocumented* servers there was/is a scene for the lower tier raids even into the naxx epoch.
---
Here's a follow up question actually; My memory is pretty foggy on this. Once reaching lvl 60, generally speaking how long does it actually take to get pre-raid geared? Or is that just going to largely depend on external factors
---
As someone who works in CS (not blizz but corporate CS), CS agents dont always get the full picture. CS is considered the very bottom of the barrel, and the official announcement for it is likely the same information they received, and much as we are confused and trying to interpret that weird detail, the CS agent likely interpreted it that way.
---
Knock! Knock! FBI Open up!
---
Thanks, looking forward for the second answer :)
---
Whoever posted that swim jumping wasn't accurate needs to watch this and see that pally in his bubble.
---
I still get teary eyed watching the old Unbreakable 60 pvp shaman video when he has to spec resto for raid
---
Good lord, this is the attitude that sucks around here. People need to wake up and try to remember what classic was actually like, or stop pretending that they actually played it at a high level.
---
If anything its the non-try-hard guilds that are more the 'meta slave' than anything else... Being in a serious pushing guild, I saw a lot more creativity and exploration around class roles especially when it came to shadow priests and ele/enhance shamans. Tough progression fight and you need more healers? Sure maybe your Spriest has to heal instead of DPS, but its not like it required a respec in Vanilla anyway to heal in an offspec. Shit I raided most of vanilla without being specced resto apart from a few fights as a shaman.
---
It's cognitive dissonance. They don't want to admit that the only reason they're still playing retail is because they don't know how to handle giving up years and years worth of mount/transmog/achievements/etc collections. 
---
Classic WoW is a very real existential threat to this bubble they've built up for themselves, and they *do not want* to understand why it is so popular.
---
They just level up with you for armor and stats, abilities you have to buy from a demon trainer
---
Oh man, don‚Äôt even get me started on the pre-OSRS days. 
---
The RS forums were a shit show - it seemed like 40% of people were heavily against Evolution of Combat, while the rest either wanted it or didn‚Äôt care. Constant arguing, entire threads filled with arguments and name-calling that would get deleted, forum mods at some points would even just outright delete or lock posts about not wanting EoC. Tons of posts about how stupid people were for wanting to keep their ‚Äúarchaic‚Äù game instead of getting a newer game. 
---
To me it never made sense - why would Jagex fundamentally change a game if so many of their paying customers were against it? If 80% of people wanted EoC I get it, but there was SO much backlash at the idea of EoC and they basically said ‚Äúthis is how it is, deal with it‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôm glad OSRS proved all of those naysayers wrong, and I‚Äôm sure the same thing will happen with Classic. I think Classic will continue to grow after it‚Äôs launched, beyond expectations, because people will see that it‚Äôs a more challenging and rewarding game. 
---
Anyways, sorry for the huge essay... just really stoked for Classic
---
"Fuck you, I won't do what ya tell me."
---
Actually think you are onto something here. Tried going back for many xpac for this reason.
---
I wont.  I'll be taking my time, looking for the best gear for easy leveling experience, keeping professions up to par, and making/helping friends.
---
Weird, I find Skada lacks far too much utility to really be useful for anything aside from 'look at muh deeps in lfg lul'.
---
Details... I mean it's in the name I suppose.
---
Um... lock shards were bagged there was no limit besides bag space. Are you thinking of the current generation/spending system?
---
Holy shit I had that back in the day! I remember the little book marks that came with it too! Wish I knew what happened to it.
---
I really like all the paladins with deathbone and lightforge
---
Did someone report Chairsnakes as a bug?
---
They just want to come off as smug.
---
So you're saying it's not ridiculous?
---
I never tried tanking before. Honestly you kinda got me wanting to try it now, thanks brother
---
I assume he‚Äôa a streamer/youtuber?  Not into that jazz. Don‚Äôt know those people.
---
How does he have two vanilla titles showing up on armory if he never played vanilla?
---
sounds good to me. I see people on this forum distinguishing "classic" from "vanilla".  But from posts here, it seems classic will be identical to vanilla 1.12 except for graphics changes.
---
Don't really remember much at this point. Just remember quitting about a month or two after the expansion launched.
---
There‚Äôs no real overarching lore/bad guy in Classic. However, each zone is its own microcosm of amazing quest chains: EPL, Westfall, Duskwood, Elwynn Forest just to name a few. 
---
Really pay attention to quest text and chains, that‚Äôs the bread and butter of Classic lore up until Raid patches.
---
Just out of curiosity are you equally anti telivision, movies, or sports programs.  If not, how is watching a stream any different?
---
lol same
---
A real sense of progression and being satisfied when I get a new upgrade or achieve something with my character in the game. Something that has been missing from the game for a long long time.
---
I wish Madseason would stream just this once.
---
I guess my concern was with how successful those late-launch guilds are at actually establishing and keeping a scene together. I guess I really shouldn't worry to much. When I think back to BC there were Kara guilds well into Hyjal prog.
---
Streamers are shit at the game. You need multiple guilds worth of dedicated no life's to get scarab lord no way in hell they'd be able to organize and manage that - someone who's played in a streamers guild
---
I still have both of these in the bottle. Yes!!
---
I don't know, I kinds prefer my pants pockets to not have sword holes in them!
---
Don't yuck someone else's yum.
---
that streamer hate is just becoming pure cringe on this sub lmao
---
It's only wrong if you create content that makes it seem like you are good and brainwash masses into following your advice.
---
Yeah I remember at some point just logging in periodically to do my garrison missions. Felt like a job so I just stopped playing.
---
the game? things relevant to the game we will be playing in about 3 months? more of that maybe? less about what X streamer thinks about Y thing? (oh I'm sorry, "content creators".)
---
maybe try forming your own opinions and asking your own questions instead of letting some Twitcher or YouTuber think for you?
---
tl;dr, this sub has become a place for "content creators" to promote themselves. (or their fanboys do it for them, FOR FREE)
---
&gt; Or am I missing a reason?
---
AV was added in 1.4
---
WSG was added in 1.5
---
AB was added in 1.7
---
That's why.
---
This is probably the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit.
---
Me and some of my housemates are stoked to jump on! I graduate from college in June but they will have school so our first few weeks are going to be us going HARD! Love seeing old community coming together for events like this!
---
There are many people who would play it, but don't know about it yet because they have abandoned the current wow/blizzard and haven't watched any announcement stuff.   For example, I knew about classic, but I didn't know it was in beta.  (and I am a little jelly) .
---
I played on Emerald Dream and I played on Nost and the latter one was a much better experience, both in terms of script quality and stability (despite HUUUUUUGE population)
---
Thank you Nost, the must fan I had in videogames in a while.
---
Shame I missed out on that. My main was a Priest during that time so I was rolling shadow in raids and disc in arenas. That provided a good amount of fun.
---
Just delete this post already it's retarded
---
Gona be lots of glame on forums for a good year or so.
---
The loud and annoying minority will kick, cry, and scream until things are the way they want them.
---
Before you know it you got AOE looting, Dungeon Finder and quest objectives on the map.
---
Sweet thanks I‚Äôll have to look it up !
---
Sorry, haven't played in a while.  osrs?  rs3?
---
He specifically mentions that if you‚Äôre coming from retail / never played classic. All of you tryhards that want to rush to 60 can do so ( I know I will). 
---
The point of the post is for those who haven‚Äôt played Vanilla to enjoy the med-level content which I cannot agree more with. The grind to 60 is half the fun and I will surely make an alt that I twink at every 10 levels when BGs come out and level slowly.
---
Holy shit his face when his imp gets destroyed.
---
Tru
---
Sorry but I don‚Äôt support pserver players. They haven‚Äôt played vanilla and most of their videos are filled with pserver gimmicks and stats.
---
I am talking about Kargoz, good videos, good content, 0 reliability.
---
Sorry.
---
Always level fishing and cooking while leveling my toons. Easily an extra 100g or more for very little work. Great guide and the prices seem fairly spot on.
---
No the tauren hitboxes guys are someone else. Perplexity only plays rogue.
---
If you don't want to get stuck in the horde of people on launch. You better not spend any time setting up your UI at the beginning.
---
Wait, thottbot isn't the main thing anymore?
---
Yeah, guy claims he can bench over 350 pounds easily also, he said it right before WoW Classic beta started during livestream. Most fitness youtubers can't even bench over 350 pounds, I'd like to see videoproof of him actually doing it.
---
Best thing about RP servers is streamers dont RP
---
It's okay to have that opinion but this is essentially what brought retail to it's current state, people don't want to play for the journey they want to play for the end, still the "end" in classic takes alot longer to achieve than retail will at least.
---
Feral can be viable but requires a lot of work/farming/min-maxing. Check out Shedo on youtube he is a good feral dps on pServers. Rogue is a lot less work for more reward.
---
hahah wtf?
---
It cancels your bandage, but you can eat n drink while dotted
---
Rogue is reliable and viable
---
Druid is unreliable and viable, but pretty much only for Night Elves.
---
Kitties don't get the benefit of Windfury, and Blessings are just better in general. DPSing as Feral is harder to get value out of, but you can definitely do it don't let someone tell you can't its just harder and raids only bring ONE Feral DPS if they bring any at all. 
---
You basically need to always bring your A-Game if you plan on doing Feral Deeps
---
on the actual game? Or are you speaking on Pservers? Cause I recall our rogues being above warriors, even into BWL.
---
Mage blink!!!  That timing ugh feels great
---
I hate the animations where the character puts one hand in the air.  My Tauren druid looks like such a sissy when he does it.
---
Mate i'll have you know the proper Vanilla alliance dueling spot is IF gates!
---
Damn, still no reports of random EU invites
---
that's some real shit right there
---
They could never implement the difficult aspects of vanilla into retail. People on retail complain that heroic level raiding is too hard.
---
So much misinformation here. Feral is viable in PvE and PvP. In fact most guilds will have a feral druid. Their AoE threat is better than warriors and they have better FR gear, plus innervate/brez/leader of the pack which makes them worth bringing instead of 1 prot warrior.
---
Only thing I didn't like about Asmon is his constant over reacting to everything. Got annoying, but I don't really enjoy WoW streams to start with so I'm not the best target.
---
I just wanted to watch someone play. Twitch has changed in its time. I was baffled when he completed DM and had 100k viewers out of no where and suddenly 50k Amazon Prime subs.
---
World of Roguecraft 1 was actually the 3rd video in the series. 3 was first, followed by 2.
---
This is why in 1 he *clearly* plays better than in 3 or 2, it was a year or more after.
---
Maybe just do whatever you like. Rushing is fun for some people. Playing slow/RP is fun for others.
---
What did he win?!?!
---
so far I've found 0 private servers that ave been true authentic vanilla types, even nostralius was easy moded to dungeons and raid content
---
I mean, surely you have time for a hobby in your real life without wow? You just replace that hobby with wow until you enjoy what you can from it matey.
---
The only difference between young you and old you is that you need to make time for your hobbies if you want to truly enjoy it.
---
[Even *more* fixed.] (https://imgur.com/a/UvdziSq)
---
OP you are a true soldier of Vanilla sir, you were in the trenches. Here‚Äôs to layering.
---
Phase 3:
---
PvP Ranks will be introduced in Phase 2
---
Warsong will be introduced in Phase 3
---
What items do you have to farm that prot warriors don‚Äôt? IMO it‚Äôs worth taking 1 feral instead of 1 more prot warrior
---
I could agree, shame there was so much content drought periods.
---
I'm fairly certain it was 50 each.
---
When you could get mythic raid gear ilevel from running heroic dungeons is why. A 75 ilvl titanforge is why we have things like raider.io cuz frankly there‚Äôs more people out there with high ilvl that don‚Äôt have the right stats or don‚Äôt have the right skill sets to play effectively then those you truly earned their gear and skills but have bad rng in terms of titanforges.
---
Most people won't make it to 60 as a Warrior, most of those people are going to get irritated rolling against all the other Warriors and Rogues, and a lot of those Warriors are going to refuse to tank for even one second.
---
I imagine there will be a great culling of Warriors between Launch and the start of Phase 2.
---
Feral is not a dps spec.
---
Thank you for better quantifying their future relationship.
---
Casual elitism is cancer and it's completely infested this sub (and the WoW community as a whole, most of the people here seem to be retail players judging by the constant anti-pserver jerk circlejerk too)
---
Wouldn‚Äôt a cancelaura macro achieve this? I can‚Äôt remember if it was working in vanilla but I definitely used it in other expansions
---
basically this threads comments
---
How?  That is literally they entire fucking point of phases being rolled out.  To have legitimate races that are as close as possible to the original experience.
---
not to speak for cornysheep, but I can't produce a television show. I can't be the director of a movie. I can't play at the elite level of professional sports.
---
but goddamnit, I can play video games. I don't need someone else to play them for me.
---
My poopsock is ready, and let me be clear: it‚Äôs a thigh high.
---
It was lore that said that as sort of an off-handed comment in regards to questioning.
---
Quite clearly because its something thats faded from existance on retail with the introduction of war mode making RP-PvP and PvP servers not really a thing.
---
Begone troll
---
Not sure why people are so opposed to changes that wouldn't effect them.  If there was an HD model toggle how does that ruin your experience if you choose not to turn it on?  HD remakes of old games are like half of new releases now, would makes sense for that option to exist for Classic.
---
Well it was 100 gold for the skill and 900 to purchase the mount.
---
&gt;Evidence of this please?  
---
&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPTtHK\_7PQo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPTtHK_7PQo)
---
Thanks for the response, I guess streamers just pick female for no particular reason then?
---
Yeah, no shit this is getting 100k views now. What's gonna happen in 6+ months (after release) is the point where we get to judge the 'you don't' part.
---
Why Chromaggus?
---
I'm specifically referring to the soul shards in bags. If a warlock is unkillable using a normal cycle of cooldowns, then reset the fight and cooldowns and attrition down his soul shards first. In an open world environment, a Warlock cannot stand its ground anywhere it chooses to, it could only force a stalemate maybe in terrains like open water. Otherwise, it will eventually, albeit slowly, run out of soul shards and lose to a rogue.
---
But since we are talking about rank 10 geared warlocks, I don't think this slow methodical grind will be necessary. However, I think theorycrafting to the extreme would allow a rogue to abuse fight resets and soulshard farming denial to eventually grind out a win.
---
*"There will be Stress Tests done at regular intervals, including late next week, around which time we will be inviting more players."*
---
By the sounds of it, the stress test invites will be just normal invites so you can continue playing even after the weekend and for the next stress test they'll simply invite another big batch of players?
---
who cares about bfa lol
---
 Yeah,  I guess I could never do it right. I would blink right before I hit the ground and end up teleporting further up into the air.
---
what does rank 14 actually mean? i'm a noob. isnt that the points you get when doing BGs and killing other players?
---
Go orc and drink the sweet sweet tears of rogues and warriors REEEEing after your 4th stun resist in a row.
---
Can't speak for retail, as I stopped playing a couple years ago, but it sure seems people don't have a keyboard anymore. No matter the online game I play, I'm shocked our I get more than a "gl hf", let alone even that. No one wants to communicate anymore. It's like "what ever, I'll just queue up for the next game/dungeon/map who cares. I don't need to be friendly, we'll never see each other again". Press F.
---
For me at the very least it is so that If i choose to help someone of the horde I have to be mindful of what abilities I use.
---
The idea is that if a rogue comes after you, you can AoE them out of stealth etc and its actually a game of cat and mouse where you can trust each other or eat each other.
---
Sleeping is for casuals ! ;-)
---
Probably not a good idea, per se, but I used to tank five-mans as a Shaman up through WotLK. Definitely viable, if you have a party willing to fuck around and have some fun. But definitely won't be a standard thing.
---
Diminishing returns was still a thing. So getting out of it with the racial made you far better off.
---
I can't fucking wait
---
To be fair, early void walker threat was shit in vanilla.
---
Hunter pets is better but you‚Äôll pull off with a few consecutive white crits, especially toward the later levels before getting a new rank of growl (every 10 levels)
---
My bad dawg
---
It's seeded, while it's randomized, various factors increase your chance to get in. OFC some people are going to get in or not, but a player that started in 2012 with no higher raiding or pvp experience will likely not get in, whereas a player starting in 2004 has a higher chance to get an invite. Nothing is 100%.
---
They invite some oldschool players, some raiders, some pvpers, a ton of streamers, and a small amount of casuals. All of these archtypes probably have a similar number of invite counts. Blizz has historically given high level players a better seed for the betas (the majority of my past mythic and pre-WoD heroic guilds got invites, it was rare for somebody not to get in before betas end), although I dont know if that's the case for Classic specifically, but I see no reason for it not to be.
---
I'm not cornysheep but yeah I don't watch tv, movies or sports. I play video games. And I only enjoy watching someone else play video games if they are much better than me. Which is why I cba to watch the current crop of classic streamers.
---
Everything you wrote sounds pretty good to me.
---
Lol pretty much. I'm rushing my rogue to 60, farming BRD until my eyes bleed for an epic mount. Then I'm going to go terrorize crossroads.
---
for rp-pvp only real rules that were enforced were naming ones, aka no aragon99, xXxlegolasxXx and other variations
---
i'd updoot twice if i could
---
Old version of bnet adding haha
---
Ohhhh so that's what totem twisting is.  I saw that everywhere and had no real idea what it was.  Thanks for telling me!
---
‚ÄúYou got to know when to hold ‚Äòem, know when to fold ‚Äòem, know when to walk away, know when to run.‚Äù
---
I see you‚Äôre a gambling man.
---
i read this a lot but i actually never found a video where it was displayed, all mounts just needed (nightelf example) "Tiger Riding (1)", which is learned at 40. Even the epic mounts required that riding (and, youknow, level 60).  
---
but i swear i couldve remembered some sort of epic mount riding cost pre 1.12.1
---
I was.
---
No, casuals that bitched about every inconvenience is what brought retail to its current state.
---
Rank 14 is high warlord and grand marshal, it‚Äôs what gives you the very nice pvp weapons. How it works in essence is each weekly reset your honorable kills are calculated and it either promotes or demoted you. To get rank 14 you need to pretty much nolife premades nonstop, so with a full time job it‚Äôd be difficult to accomplish.
---
People like vanilla because it was the original but people who played everything and i am one would say tbc and the start of lk (before lfd) was wow at its prime.
---
Basically when they started removing social aspects in favour of qol and auto queue was when wow went down the path to where we are now.
---
Not reading the quests doesn't make sense, but figuring more complex things out by talking to other players builds connections and keeps the immersion.
---
my suggestion is to tweet Ion or a Dev with your thoughts in a calm and concise manner.
---
No idea how much hp a rogue that level has, but rebirth restores 400 hp and 700 mana at rank 1. It's a lot higher than other resurection spells!
---
this is pure gold. please keep making these!
---
Classic Beta still using incorrect stealth animations (too fast movement from modern wow): 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKCUxRCILks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKCUxRCILks)
---
The raids themselves are actually rather decent. It's the lack of exclusivity and lousy character progression that damages the experience for most people longing for vanilla.
---
Let's not forget how hard it is to get anywhere as a casual with the requirements players put up but on the other hand how hard it is to no life with the amount of difficulties you have to go trough with itemization based on Titanforging and shitty stats.
---
Well, I believe he's reached 60 on a pserver.
---
even PvP discussion is so wholesome in here. goddamn i can‚Äôt wait to be a part of this community again
---
Phase 3? Damn that seems late. Doesn‚Äôt really matter though.
---
Its funny because I feel such the opposite. My friends all want to go ally but I hate ally with a passion, besides Night Elf what races are there? Human? I'm a human IRL why would I play a fantasy game to play something I already am? Dwarf? Well that's just half a human. Gnome? Well that's just half a dwarf!.
---
Orcs, trolls, Tauren, and undead make me feel at home, it feels right killing alliance! Also I never liked westfall, I like the horde early level zones much more besides the barrens, well and Teldrassil.
---
Having WA is not really going to change anything that didn't exist back in the day. Wow vanilla has always been a game played with add-on support that's been worse than whatever WA is bringing into it.
---
I'm still not hearing any good reasons as to why apart from the sense of trying to have classic be exactly the same as it was in vanilla even down to what add-ons are allowed.
---
To think, I made this joke right on this very sub as soon as Classic was announced. We have come full circle today. Take your up vote!
---
hi another TVC member, were you btw on alliance or horde side there?
---
Eh, parsing and hall of fame etc. are plenty enough exclusivity for me at least, and much prefer it to the grind I used to have to do to raid/PvP in vanilla, now it‚Äôs about performance rather than time.
---
more like ‚Äî what should the playerbase learn from Classic/Retail?
---
nothing is ever enough. if Blizzard never added flying mounts to Azeroth people would still be posting threads ‚ÄúBlizz why can‚Äôt we have flying mounts?‚Äù people are just never satisfied and they the players are just as responsible for what Retail has become.
---
It's a useful and optional tool that you dont have to install if you dont like. Quest databases like WoWhead and ClassicDB can already trivialize quests, this just offers an ingame option to do so. This doesnt open new lines of play.
---
Elwynn-loch/darkshore-westfall-finish darkshore-finish westfall/deadmines
---
So many times getting lost trying to find a quest item lol
---
&gt; Must not have great experiences with others to have these expectations of yourself lmao
---
Oh, I'm very well liked by my friends, it's just that you came off as very unfriendly after I gave you a helpful tip, so I just wanted to make sure. 
---
Yeah, I use Reddit to kill time as well. I'm glad we have something in common, I can already feel us becoming besties.
---
Goblins are in there though
---
Strange thing that all the streamers and their friends seem to get in more easily then others.
---
But, that‚Äôs ok. You can still enjoy the game even if others aren‚Äôt enjoying it the way *you* think is best. 
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm not gonna rush, but I couldn‚Äôt care less if others are.
---
I agree but also gaming culture has shifted, it's all about showing off your sparkly items and cool mounts nowadays which also holds true for retail. The gaming community was just different during actual Vanilla in 2004.
---
Amen! Thank you all
---
Hmmm, one $50 dollar entry ticket vs hundreds of dollars for subscriptions.
---
Really makes you go hmmmm
---
Let‚Äôs not forget the point of this beta is bug reporting.
---
Not getting ‚Äúworld firsts‚Äù or speed running things like all these streamers are doing.
---
MoP had absolutely horrible PvP gameplay, all classes had trillions of defensive/self healing abilities forcing you to use all your CDs when they were low on health just to secure a kill. And I won't even talk about things like BM hunters and their zoo's. 
---
A shame because WPvP was absolutely there and massive. Timeless Island was a blast, fighting around the Sha of Anger, at the Thunder Island, in Krasarang Wilds or at the PvP vendors on the Serpent's spinetoo. If only it had LK/BC class gameplay it could, maybe, have been the greatest PvP expansion ever. But well, we know how it went.
---
It did offer us glimpses of proper character progression with the artifact weapons and expansive class quests that we basically didn't have in-game for almost 10 years.
---
People are more willing to role play when the infinate gear treadmill is removed, and classic provides that.
---
Well I mean, he has sold himself as being a prot-warrior.
---
It‚Äôs painfully large and the quests send you back and forth it seems but there are probably decent leveling paths for it
---
MY EGO ISN'T FRAGILE IF I WAS SO FRAGILE HOW DID I MANAGE TO BEAT DEADMINES YEARS AGO BEFORE THESE SO CALLED "WORLD FIRSTS"
---
checkmate atheists
---
I remember being excited in wrath that I could afk AV to level my mage and get all the welfare honor gear by 80. I'm like 99% sure it wasnt in BC
---
Titan was legit though. You could pick which ones you wanted, they didn't take up space that was used by anything else and showed really handy stuff
---
The optimizations on the private servers are pretty clearly only partially useful, also we didn't see what how the leveling went because it wasn't recorded.
---
Also keep in mind this was a server first not a /played record so I expect the time to be beat pretty handily in the next few days.
---
Lastly, it's very possible even Joana wouldn't have beat this time in his normal route real time. It is widely known that Joana does 18-4(or even 6) on-off whereas Skorch did nearly 30hrs straight.
---
The updated graphics (foliage, water, etc.) we're probably mandatory in the game since the graphics overhaul with Cataclysm. They probably don't have just the old stuff working with the 7.0 client that they used. If character models were interchangeable (which I think you're correct that they were) in 6.0 then the old animations would stay, but old models were also in the code so they chose to use only those. I'm thinking the other things they don't have a choice on because it was an engine update; not just a client update.
---
Second Kargoz, dude is really chill, has really well made class breakdown videos, and seems to know a lot about classic while admitting he doesn‚Äôt know everything, imo a nice change of pace from some of the other popular names that played a couple years on a Private server and claim they know everything.
---
Depends on how lucky you are with drops and who you group with. Try to group with guildies who don't need the same items as you, IE: warrior tank, rogue dps, mage dps, Hunter dps, priest healer. 
---
Keep in mind a lot of pre raid bis stuff is used by multiple classes. There's plenty of guides out right now that can help get an idea of what items you need and how hard they will be to get. Hope this helps!
---
good on you man.
---
too many are treating this like its "early access" when they should be reporting bugs, to improve the final game. that's the whole point of a beta test, right? you want a good final version of Classic right? stop messing around and TEST
---
this hurts my head
---
Technically yes but if the shaman takes note of how much it's healing for, they may not purge it.
---
Lol...Damn it! I should have known better!
---
Lets be real. Soda doesnt give a fuck what people think. I love that guy and hope he keeps being him. Everyones different though thats true.
---
I'd argue the top 5 classic WoW content creators are all highly overrated, but that's beside the point. They were the first people to attempt to fill the vanilla WoW niche, and they struck while the iron was hot.
---
You're totally within your right to dislike the guy. I certainly don't like him. But denying he has some charisma is just disingenuous. There are some boring ass motherfuckers out there, especially on the Internet. And yeah he just rambles on endlessly; that's literally the kind of content YouTube rewards lol.
---
This is great.
---
i thought pve items were better for pvp. how would that work. couldn't i just get a lucky weapon drop in a raid or is those rank 14 weapons more superior and better?
---
And the Tauren said, "Thirteen inches!"
---
Why would I shout at blizz for being bad?  That are bringing back the game I love.
---
Why many words when one word do
---
Yeah I got in around 9:30pm EST last night.
---
Jesse is one of the single most dense people I've ever had the misfortune of watching content of.
---
Crendor is okay tho, but god does jesse just either not get anything or pretend not to get anything...
---
I have not, but since it was there in 1.12 I have to assume it will be.
---
YoUCaN'tGeTyOuRcHiLdHoOdBaCk!1!1!11one
---
Black lotus will only increase longevity on the raids imo. Flasks can be counteracted by good gear for most classes. Only necessary for some tanks and dps depending on which boss.
---
So what ? Even if he's not the first, he will certainly be among the first 50 of the server.
---
Those 50 will try to avoid PVP like plague because it would slow them if they die.
---
My point is that when your among the fastest of the server is that you won't encounter much PVP if at all.
---
Yeah right?
---
It is what it is ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just you man.
---
lol... what? A good rogue will beat any class except for the occasional frost mage. Every other class does not have the opportunity to outplay a rogue. You‚Äôre dead before you can control your character. Don‚Äôt spread misinformation
---
Feels good cause so many of these content creators were so confident. Nice to see them humbled a bit.
---
Probably but you're not alone lol all of us are just antsy and ready to play
---
Savory Deviate Delights can be farmed at super low level for great income
---
Some fish are needed for engineering recipes,  many are needed for cooking, some are needed for alchemy
---
altogether the market for fish is just much larger in vanilla, as its used for many professions and buffs are popped in 5 mans and even world content in vanilla, so theyre used far more often than other expansions
---
I really enjoyed Vanilla myself, even with all its faults. For me BC was WoW's peak. I didn't really have any issues with Wrath either, but for me it was around Cata when things started going downhill.
---
There is no way to immune every fear on nef or ony, even with perfect cd usage by your tank.
---
Your statement just shows how little you know about the content and the utility of fear ward.
---
I know I'm in the minority here, but I actually found Legion to be worse. WoD absolutely had far less content, but the classes hadn't been pruned to hell in WoD. I'd rather have less to do, but have more fun doing it.
---
Hi, /u/NarrativeSand
---
Garithos hating on Elves was a thing (he was also about to start purging the dwarves too, before Sylvanas killed him).
---
he was a local lord who took over the situation in the North in the chaos follow the Legion invasion, his actions had nothing to do with anyone else.
---
and a lot of that, (except Garithos being a giant racist asshole, which he is) was the fault of the Dreadlords after Detheroc MC'd most of his army.
---
Elves being given to horde was one of the flimsiest bits of lore justification in existence. When we had a whole freaking ogre faction INCLUDING Rexxar who was gonna be a big deal in Outland that was primed and ready to be the new horde race.
---
While on the alliance side we get High Elves/Night Elves to go confront Kael'thas/Illidan over what the heck has been going on. With Arator being our liason to the Council of Silvermoon.
---
But nope, we have to retcon the corruptors of Sargeras into being the poor innocent fools he corrupted instead. Because Metzen forgot.
---
And we'd still get Draenei...real draenei, that aren't renegade Eredar.
---
Well they're playing like they've never played WoW...
---
Like many of them play like they haven't even levelled a character on retail...
---
Rogues can beat hunters.
---
It just depends on the class as well as where progression is. A rank 14 warrior with that dope ass axe is going to cause some real harm. Some classes don‚Äôt have equal options for drops in PvE as well, not every raiding guild is going to give their prot tank who is pushing rating a 2h axe when others need it more.
---
I don't know about not wanting the beta, but I'm fine with not getting it.
---
I can see the reason's the team might be concerned especially in regards to the EU for RP-PvP servers - the old method was to have one or more per main language - This is at the very least English, French, German and maybe Spanish.
---
They could of course have a server for all languages sort of like how the America's only get "English" servers.
---
Now as a firm supporter of RP-PvP servers and founder of a RP-PvP intended guild. I believe it to be a disservice to release any RP-PvP servers at a later date as I expect the curve of classic players to be heavily front loaded and fall off later.
---
Without the initial wave of long term players on the server, the server will struggle if introduced later - people be unlikely to move across servers once they have established within a community even more so if they have to start from scratch again and the server is later in its progression cycle.
---
To all RP-PvP Supporters and Fan's, the best thing I can suggest is keep making noise - if you have streamer friends that are getting involved with the beta etc ask or call in favours. If you want to tweet at the dev's, post of the forums and make noise that is concise - of course avoid being a dick, we want to have a good image unlike those who target and harass us for pursuing our intended server type.
---
It's not bad design, it's just a temporary hurdle that'll only affect the launch of the game, and that only in the starting zones where everyone is necessarily clustered together. Give it a couple weeks and the "problem" will resolve itself, just like it did the first time 'round.
---
Blizzard is "choosing not have that in their re-release of Classic" because they're so terrified of people being turned away by a little adversity they're willing to sacrifice authenticity on the altar of expediency.
---
Which is, again, exactly the mentality that gave us retail WoW in the first place.
---
Bought a sub, bought bfa, and leveled a character. Only for the beta. Still no beta... peepoSad
---
It's been 2 days since the beta. Some people might be rushing, others are probably testing things. Next week gonna be another weave, don't worry, they'll do their best

Does it come with a tiny battery hooked up so that it shocks me every time I complete the circuit by poking myself with both prongs?
---
you'll find groups way easier as a healer. it also takes more skill to heal in vanilla than it does in live due to having to worry about your mana and using skills appropriately
---
I don't understand people who claim vanilla/tbc were grindy and then fire up retail and push M+ all night.
---
It was way less grinder while also that much more meaningful than this crap we have today.
---
Dude you need some serious help.
---
An observation I've made when playing in BFA in groups; If you engage with your group from the get-go (even a simple "sup gang"), you'll tend to get a chattier, friendlier group. I think that deep down most people (even on retail) crave and are longing for interraction again, but many feel they can't get them because nobody initiates or tries to be social. All it takes is a simple joke or message or two and suddenly it's fun again.
---
Classic can be the same. Talk to your party! Make jokes. Have fun. Make *friends*. Thats the best part. Those people you group with that you like? Chances are, if you met in a dungeon once, you're probably at a similar progression level... Which means you're likely to see them again down the line as well!
---
Retail has conditioned us to stop being friendly, even if we want to. Break that cycle. Make friends again.
---
Stop trying to tell people how they should play the damn game.

Yea you really have to work around the void walker's threat with dots to make it super efficient, but at least a smart lock will take the voidwalker buff on the demonology tree, do you think it's as good as hunter pet's then? Never really played hunter besides as my first character way back in 2004 which I dont remember lol.

I don't want in it either.  I want to go into classic fresh as I can without any bugs and don't want to have to redo my questing because the beta is over.
---
The only thing I would even attempt to do in the beta is when they allow you to make a level 60 just so I can test out some classes at max level for like a day and that's it.
---
Please Blizzard.
---
Man this rings so true for me. I remember being so disappointed in the lack of content in WoD that I went looking for p servs.
---
If I have to explain you why transmog is a bad idea for WoW Classic, then you'll never understand it.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna farm hk‚Äôs in STV on my hunter‚Äù
---
\&gt; This is not the only game where this is  happening, look at pretty much most long-running franchises, cod,  battlefield, far cry, fallout, halo, need for speed, mass effect, dragon  age and so many others.
---
I played most of these games during their golden age. I still periodically revisist mw1-black ops, dragon age origins, and 1-New vegas. The new games just aren't good, but the old ones still are. Everything good about the old games holds up, but the new games fall apart under critique.
---
Eh I'd say over the 8 years of streaming I'm in the rough 40s.

No pretty sure they were not. They were affected by spell batching and had an activation time.
---
Is that my guy Tim Key? I never knew Richard Ayoade had directed a film! I'll have to check it out.
---
Wondering the world. Getting gear that matters..  levelling that takes 3-4 hours per level not 30 minutes
---
Yeah I meant as Feral DPS in raids, bear can probably do something but I don't have a lot of experience with bears tanking the raids I'm in.
---
Just had one guy who kept getting 1 shot by ragnaros when he tried to tank it lol
---
Soda can't heal.
---
Healing is very, very easy at low levels like that. You just have to not have your thumb up your ass and your tank has to pull things smartly.
---
oh DEAR LORD
---
If it's  windows 7 you can get a fix on tpb
---
Did you spec shadow for levelling ? Because in my memory shadow was certainly not slow as far as TTK goes !
---
If you want a DPS healer you may consider shaman, they can do both convincingly (but no DPS in raids, just healing).
---
He could have easily had he actually tried healing.
---
keep checking you'll get in
---
It depends on your role. Some roles 100% have to speak.
---
Hypocrite, look at the fucking post.
---
Hi, /u/HappyHolidays666
---
Both sides exaggerate many aspects of the different versions. Most people are condemning or praising Retail/Classic based on their perspective and experience. For example my vanilla main was a warlock so leveling was quite easy and pleasant for me. Ask a person who leveled a warrior or a paladin and you may get an entirely different perspective on vanilla leveling. On retail they are people whose progress is normal raids with friends and family and then there are Cutting Edge players or even top 50 world players. Their perspective,experience and understanding of the game can vary a lot. That's what most people fail to understand. There is no single Vanilla or Retail experience, it's an amalgmation of so many different factors and people of all walks of life that is a fallacy to predict the failure or success of classic based on your experience.
---
This is my vanilla [toon](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/dentarg/phobia). By most peoples' standards,a veteran of vanilla. I loved the game back then, I played a lot and by vanilla standards I was a good player. But while watching the streams I realized that I can never go back to classic for several reasons. I will surely watch streams of raids and/or premade pvp to satisfy my nostalgia. Even for that minor reason I hope Classic will be a success and I hope people who have been long waiting for this to be satisfied with the end product.
---
I‚Äôll probably rush my main more than any of my alts just because I want to get into raiding ASAP. I plan to catch alchemy up when I hit 60 while farming herbs for my mount and gearing up doing dungeons.
---
Nice, I played Resto Druid for all of BC and half of Wrath then swapped to resto shaman after all the cool stuff was on it's way out XD.  I'm doing ele shaman currently but just waiting for classic to come out to do enh shaman for the windfury XD
---
I mean if you're a healer than there's no reason why you would ever be granted dps gear. You are the healbot and there's nothing wrong with that but it sounds like you don't enjoy healing at all. So I would not recommend you go healer.
---
I'd just suggest playing a dps class and if you're that concerned about competing for gear, then pick a class with less competition. But understand it's Classic so everybody will have to deal with that to an extent.
---
God forbid somebody makes a mistake in the presence of you neckbeards lmao. Been tuning into him since beta launch and he seems like a good guy. WoW is a game that has been with some of us for more than half of our lives. It‚Äôs easy to forget 1-2 low level mob mechanics/values from 15 years ago. If you guys think you can entertain better and provide flawless info the entire time than do it and stop talking. Stop pointing fingers at people hyping up the game we all love.

---
Lol interesting perspective, I never thought about that but it's true it would feel like you're moving faster or slower!
---
It seems unlikely that Blizzard will try to port much in the way of Classic style gameplay or content to modern WoW. But it is possible that they may take back end concepts like "layers" and port them over to the modern client and server infrastructure.
---
If they ever get around to doing another round of realm connections like they mentioned they were working on some time back before BFA launched, then that along with the layer mechanic could allow them to drastically reduce the number of dead realms through new connections, while retaining the ability to smoothly handle population concurrency booms like around expansion release day. It also would let them eliminate cross-realm zones, while still having realms feel more populated (through new connections), but with less disruptive immersion-breaking phasing in the open world (by use of layers).
---
Whether they perceive this as a win feature for modern, I'm not sure. But it is new tech developed to meet a need in Classic that realistically could be ported to modern WoW without any massive shift in their design culture, which is a much harder sell than something that is more of an infrastructure tweak.
---
this, you dont even need to be over geared.  level is everything at this point in the journey and it makes everything easier and the runs much smoother.  
---
you get far more call backs to tank for people when you come prepared.
---
I'm pretty convinced it's people who have been subbed and playing BFA but have been trying to claim they don't play anymore for e-cred. They're the same people who leave threads on the official forums about "why I'm unsubbing" and are back a month later.
---
Do you know if the access shows up on the bnet website as well under accounts? I wanna know if its a waste of time to look while at work
---
You are my hero
---
On a lore stand point, ya super flimsy, on the basis of a video game in which they wanted to hit the demographic of people who enjoy playing monsters and those who like to play pretty things but don't want to be associated with X or Y faction then ya it makes sense.
---
I don't think resilience really did much else but separate pvp from pve gear completely
---
I wasn't talking about retail, and neither was the OP. I was asking why he's leveling slower relative to pservers.
---
Yeah, they're literally exclusively inviting people who were subscribed on the first day of Vanilla.
---
If you weren't, you're not getting in for the time being.
---
the second point, does that mean even if i subscribed today i wont be considered because i wasnt subscribed when the beta started?
---
I‚Äôm sure he wishes he could be good, seems to be more focused on monetization than his gameplay though
---
&gt;Take the quest and never turn in it
---
Was the quest that gives you a wand to turn yourself into a furbolg in Vanilla?
---
No fucking way MadSeasonShow didn't get in. Shit makes me wanna cry
---
Back in the day even regular pvp servers had RP and naming rules. I‚Äôm down for rp pvp and would roll there for sure.
---
they are your enemies now. we will destroy them
---
I implore you as well, to play the game however the fuck you want, and not let people on the internet tell you how to enjoy your free time.
---
Emerald dream was authentic, they're out there. You just have to look.
---
This is the kind of content that we need
---
Nothing. They do not mix. The former is well that was right with gaming. The latter is all that was wrong and profiteering.
---
Warrior has the highest required time commitment of any class. That's just how it is unfortunately.
---
It's one of the main reasons why I'm switching my main class Warrior to Shaman.
---
&gt;No idea how strict people will be in classic but a lot of specs just arent good.
---
Don't you dare even thinking of suggesting anything tho, or face the consequences of being downvoted.
---
Good initiative!
---
I was watching a streamer yesterday who brought it up.
---
The only metric I have to compare for Warlock is:
---
Spirit * 0.07 + 6
---
He had 56 spirit which should be 9.92 HP per tick. His HP went up by "nine or ten per tick"
---
Seems accurate for that so far.
---
I need new lens, gettin hard to read the screen again!
---
I'm with you there but I will say he opened up to the idea of playing but as a class he never touched. If it's not his cup of tea that's OK too. I do admit I want that nostalgia bug and the social aspect really bad myself. I like meeting people and playing with others and modern just doesn't give much of that, or it feels like pulling teeth to get a response on /party when I'm random groups.
---
I like one raid difficulty with it increasing each tier. Makes getting up the ladder more fun. It‚Äôs also nice seeing people with gear I can‚Äôt hope to get. In modern wow tier sets are meaningless from a looks department because people transmog all the time.
---
Yes, viewing things on mobile is just entirely different. And your example is one of the best ones, because it doesn't look great on PC but on the phone it's fucking fantastic.
---
How am i dumb?
---
&gt;Duel scenarios
---
Which is usually the case when discussing 1v1 matchups, unless it was specified that it's world pvp in the first place. 
---
&gt;In an open world 1v1 fight

Since when do all warlocks run around with zero shards, is this like an unspoken rule? What "harassment cycle"?

idiocracy*
---
I dont like the classicast trios content, but Ill tell ya, this squeaky kid may be my new least favorite streamer
---
Does powershifting work? Is there a GCD on shifting forms?

Do +weapon damage enchants affect your druid form? Does Manual Crowd Pummeler work?

Does transforming into a druid form remove your tauren hitbox increase?
---
He also got like 3000 subs at the end of Deadmines. That's the highest amount of subs I've ever seen someone get in the span of about 10 minutes
---
A lot of us have known hes a hack for a while, he's said some really fucking stupid shit about private servers back then, and he's always talked a lot louder than he is educated about the game. He's a casual who never made it into higher raiding or PvP, he's a talking head, not somebody to follow for any kind of gameplay related matters. Every time he's tried to talk about the gameplay required for somehting, he either reads off a wiki or forum post from sombody who knows what they're talking about, or re riffs it and pulls fake facts out of his ass.
---
I used to have the Atlas, gave it away (or threw it out) about two years ago because I didn't see the point in keeping it.
---
Then they announced Classic, lol.
---
That's a good question that I'd like to see clarified as well.
---
Theoretically, no. But I've heard that Blizzard code is spaghetti code. It took us years just to get added backpack slots because adding them destroyed the game for some reason.
---
What a total boob ü§£üòÇ
---
Alliance
---
"I'm unsubbed but I got invited"
---
Customer service determined that was a lie?
---
How can you check how old your earliest subscribtion Month was? I know it was something like 2005 or 2006, but dont know exactly.
---
Same. I checked my email, nothing. I opened my launcher, there it was.
---
I only ever played vanilla and people always used to say, "the game starts at 60." Rushing to level cap was always a thing. I however rerolled a thousand times and only ever made it to 40 but its definitely a myth that people weren't min-maxing during vanilla.
---
No welfare gear. No LFR no LFG. Leveling actually being fun.
---
With as random as it was nothing was as satisfying as one shotting someone in a BG thanks to a triple wf crit the couple of times I tried enh. Overall though I enjoyed elemental in BGs the few times I wasn't resto.
---
I'm sure someone in this subreddit is from the future and is happy to provide an accurate answer.
---
Except people will be impressed. Not everyone but they aren't trying to impress everyone. They're doing it for their audience and people who care.
---
Yeah I trust them more than blizzard who has the actual database tables and stats for everything
---
The real truth is that you need 1 dwarf priest for nefarian and its really helpful on ony. In reality, you CAN kill nef without fear ward. But there is risk of a wipe without fear ward. 
---
It is impossible to fear immune every fear these bosses put out. So your MT will eat a fear at some point.  The OT can hold his immune for that moment and take over tanking the boss. However as soon as the fear on MT is over, the boss will turn to face him again. If the tank ran into your healers while feared, the boss is now casting shadow flane on your healers, wiping you.
---
Having your main tank eat fears is going to limit his threat gen. With bad luck on class calls, threat can bevome a massive issue on nef. This can grind your raid dps to a halt. Fear Ward is very very valuable on this fight, especially on the first kill. Instead of juggling aggro and trying to gen threat through fears, the MT just holds boss the whole time. Your OT is free to help w adds. Your dps arent threat capped. 
---
So 1 dwarf priest at least will basically be guaranteed a spot in BWL. You do provide something very important as dwarf. But tge rest of priests can be any race. Take that info how you will. As dwarf, you basically get guaranteed spot in Pugs for any raid though its really isnt needed in MC. As Nelf, you will still get groups, but sometimes you may be overlooked for a dwarf.
---
Lol theres plenty of classes that can regularly destroy rogues 1v1 (it changes on a spectrum of player skill/gear):
---
Hunter
---
Warlock
---
Feral Druid
---
Warrior
---
Shadow Priest
---
Thanks.
---
And now to determine if it's worth it to sped $4 to animate the wallpaper I'm already using...
---
This is awesome btw, and very tempting.
---
Casual elitism?
---
Jumbo Shrimp.
---
Yeah, fuck up even once and the internet will never forget it. You also kind of lock yourself into that career because you're usually not developing any other kind of marketable skills, so if it ends up failing for any reason, you're screwed.
---
Then again, the most popular streamers will never have to work another day in their lives, so I guess it doesn't really matter for them.
---
WA is amazing. I have no doubts that you could do all the things WA does in vanilla.
---
Vanilla is way more game breaking.
---
In vanilla you could have 1 key scan the raid and heal the target with lowest health with the exact rank needed. It can also cancel the cast if it's going to overheal.
---
Set up a keyboard macro that spams the button and you can go do laundry or something during boss fights.  CastSpellByName( ) should have never been added to the API.
---
&gt;But I didn't really like the braindead wanding for 70 hours
---
Yeah, that's really getting to me as well. I am heavily considering a priest main, but god do I hate just wanding everything to level. Not to mention the level 25-45 deadzone where the only good wands are BoE world drops that sell for 20-100g, or lucky drops off rare dungeon bosses. I'm pretty sure I used the gravestone sceptre BFD quest reward for that entire time. There's also druid/shaman/pally for healing, but outside of druid they're even slower than priests.
---
I'm either going priest, hunter, or warlock; but I'm very tempted to do priest even with the worse gold grinding and solo content... I'm interested in the group dynamics of the game, and playing a healer makes it easier to do group content than DPS.
---
could you take a picture of your collection? im collecting as well and wanna see if there mabey are things i dont know about!
---
Hi, how are nameplates working here? ctrl+v makes a nameplate with health bar upon every target visible on screen. In every vanilla private server however, it gets bugged as time goes on and you eventually need to re-apply it by another ctrl+v. In TBC+, it worked properly, so my question is, is it working as intended or its still getting bugged by not showing up after some time?
---
For real. That is by far the most toxic community I have ever encountered online or otherwise.
---
I mean us raiders have been shitting on him for months, WAYYY before it was popular. The dude is a noob and he talks about shit he doesnt understand like he knows whats up. It's stupid.
---
The only tips content worth watching are colabs and interviews. His gameplay was and is dogshit.
---
reverse psychology doesn't work
---
He was too easily outraged by the title alone.
---
The ones complaining in here are 100% angry neckbeards.
---
F. Pretty sure there are some cheap ones online
---
Just avoid any Deep Ocean Vast Sea PTSD flashbacks and Darkshore was definitely one of my favorite laid out zones.
---
surprised that no one poly'd a mini boss to really blow his mind in WC
---
This makes me wonder what's considered the greatest points for each class. I never played past wrath, but it is hard to imagine hunters ever being better in pvp than pre explosive shot nerf. That shit was stupidly overpowered
---
They are? I must have overlooked them somehow. I looked through the chart three times before making my post. :P
---
Where are they?
---
That's not true. There are people who played all over history that got in
---
Since they're going with the modern API I think macros will need to follow that format rather than vanilla format. I didn't read any blue post about it but I've seen it tossed around here (so can't confirm) but supposedly the devs have also discussed tweaking addon API access so some modern addons don't work, either. They might break group finder addons is specifically what I've heard in the rumor mill.
---
yeah everyone looking like a colorful clown in Classic is a good idea though.
---
Apex Legends was the number one game for like a month straight. Now it only occasionally breaks top 10.
---
Layering kills immersion and will result in people frequently relogging and attempting to game layer. 
---
The first thought in your head when players log in now will be, I hope I landed in the good layer, if not maybe I should retry
---
To say that layering *improves* the player experience is laughable
---
I think people need to accept that there are two types of players in this world. Some people won't like classic. Just like some people don't like retail. There is no perfect game for everyone so get that idea out of your head
---
earth shock, rockbiter, lightning shield. they were fine for tanking while leveling and most 5 mans at 60, they were good in any instance with a lot of casters like scholo.
---
Why the fuck are people upvoting this when the proof is in my comment?
---
Like who?
---
lol yeah, lots of stuff piled on other stuff and long forgotten calls to long forgotten elements that break when you look at 'em funny. It'd be nice if somewhere along the way they'd pay some people to just clean up the code lol
---
My thoughts as well. So Tuesday we should see a giant invite wave...
---
Can anybody explain the world chat situation on beta?  It seems to be present but is it just for the beta?  I really don't want world chat to be a thing on launch.  IMO you should have to go to the cities and use trade.  Haven't been able to find much info on this.
---
There are ZERO other words necessary when talking about shaman tanking viability.  Its a waste of time to think about
---
Haha, don't worry about it. First image, middle left "the lineage of goblins".
---
So you're just going to play classic?
---
I saw the cinematic. They kill the assassins, then thrall pieces out to come back to Classic, hence the abandoned comment
---
It was at the point where tanks couldn't even be buffed per raid group. Wasn't at the level of we can't raid flask. Obviously nost was a single shard supporting a lot of raid guilds. What needs to be laid out, for me at least, is number of servers and how sharding will work. It may alleviate or worsen the issue, I'm not sure.
---
Anything I don‚Äôt agree with is neonazi, modern left in a nutshell.
---
Um... have 2 characters?
---
Stop telling people what to do. If they enjoy rushing to 60, let them enjoy it. What's up with you guys and telling people how to play the game?
---
Hi, /u/benPaludan
---
lol you can have your opinion on whether layering is good or bad, but to act like it was implemented specifically for player experience is just silly.
---
I think there's going to be a huge amount of players who  haven't touched WoW in the longest time coming back to try out Classic. Unsure how long the population will be sustained, but it's going to have been a huge success for Blizzard.
---
They were actually called meeting stones in vanilla. You could also queue to these budget lfg queues from the innkeepers in major citys.
---
Its DM for Deadmines from the beginning. You can simply know that because there was no Dire Maul in the game, when you frist ran Deadmines. Also Dire Maul was known as DM:E, DM:N and DM:W in the trade chat. VC is more of a cata thing.
---
Yes im one of them. So your gonna be shocked by the turn out! By the AQ patch Blizzard decides to... oh shit the future time traveling police squad found me! I will try to finish the answer 1 year from now when I get them off my trail!
---
well if that's true i never saw it and i mained a holy priest from launch to bc. only warriors could properly tank instances/raids from my experience
---
Because it's not him. Same model, but it's colored differently and labeled "Drakeadons," which weren't added until Cata.
---
There's really nothing to test there.  It gives you a buff that increases attack speed by 50%, its affects the attack formula just like tiger's fury does (+damage).
---
Blizz loves easter eggs but they *hate* being humble
---
Which is totally fair; everyone's mileage varies.
---
I wouldn't go as far as saying "megahit", but i do think it will be a lot more popular than BFA unless BFA gets significantly better somehow.
---
It could be interpreted that way. They made the sub requirement its own statement and there were reports about people getting invited unsubbed.
---
Bitch, im still playing diablo 2, im playing classic forever.
---
That being said, if i get bored im not going to retail, i tried every xpac and i disliked every one of them since WOTLK(which i liked).
---
The best option in my opinion is to increase the server population cap to ~5000.
---
im defo gonna play a warrior.
---
Interesting considering my co-worker says he got an invite for beta, hasn't been active in months. He did have to sub to get into beta, but the invite was still there prior.
---
My first mmo was city of heroes so WoW was hardcore for me.
---
After talking to a bunch of people in the Beta yesterday, it seemed like most of them had vanilla accounts.
---
It's almost like they just read the title, got into a tizzy, and commented DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
---
It's almost like you clarified this post was for retail players in your first paragraph lmao
---
Yeah I mainly went shadowform for leveling. If I wanted to blast through things it was easy but the downtime eats up a lot of time, added in with the cost of constantly begging mages for water or buying out of pocket.
---
You can just grab the link from wowhead nowadays.
---
That was def a bug that's been fixed since.
---
I do.
---
A lot of people saying retail players won't enjoy it, but you simply can't resist the charm of lvling in Classic when most of your friends/online group are with you, not to mention the fact that your toon is not just a set of gear and abilities, it's moments and memories, some of frustration, some of joy.
---
It helps once you realize that McConnell is just doing a bit most of the time. Don't take it too seriously, he's actually helped improve the stream a lot in the past. If it wasn't for his "coaching", Asmongold would've ragequit Dark Souls really fucking fast and I'm glad he didn't because that was some really good content (unlike his Dark souls 3 streams, which were pretty boring).
---
Pservers goblins are pure cancer in that room
---
Die at the right point and spirit healer rez can cut running time through Darkshore by a bit actually.  Especially if you happen to be a low level pink haired gnome who's overly ambitious about getting ahead of the pack when your main's realm happens to be down for maintenance.
---
Last sub: 7/21/2016
---
Here's my advice. Quest as ret but keep some healy gear in your bags and heal instances and groups. This will help you during your soloing. You don't have to level as holy to heal 5-mans. Do some research, maybe consider when you are high enough lvl and have the talent points and gear, respec for AoE grinding and continue healing instances and groups.
---
I don't think leveling holy is going to take you sooooo much longer, especially early on when groups are plenty. You might try just speccing holy from the start, because everybody will be in your level range for a looong time.
---
I‚Äôm torn between warrior lock and Mage, but it‚Äôs doable. You‚Äôll just take longer to get to end game stuff but enjoy the process and don‚Äôt rush it.
---
Long as you have an active sub, you're eligible
---
I think it's going to be just as big as I thought it would be.
---
I thought even before nost that if they introduced legacy server they would be extremely popular.  Classic is the start to a 'new' WoW IMO.
---
Why not Zoidberg?
---
Considering it's still nearly 4 Months until release and the cap stays at 30. I really wanna play right now
---
Yeah, You are right. Axin is 59 lvl.
---
Why do we need a reddit post for this
---
I *created* a guild so I can MT. :)
---
I'm not interested in rushing and no-lifeing. So I created a guild for like minded people.
---
The last I counted there were 164 guilds recruiting in the Classic WoW Guilds Discord. You can likely find one to match your preferences. And if not, maybe you too can create one.
---
there has been at least two waves so far.  all the streamers got in and between then and this morning, another one went out, because I got in as well.  pretty sure I wasn't in when the streamers were in because I checked.  
---
so they've done at least 1 "community" wave at this point.
---
It‚Äôs going to be like the level 17 hunter meme for Alexmemesual
---
Yeah you‚Äôre definitely right about rose tinted goggles. I can already see a large portion of the community getting bored very quickly when they remember all the ‚Äòinconveniences‚Äô that come with classic. 
---
I‚Äôm just going to play with 4 friends and enjoy it. No rush, just relax and have a good laugh.
---
I know, I'm just...You know, nevermind. The more I try to talk about it, the more hits I take.
---
FFZAP lets you get the BTTV emotes without all the other shitty things about BTTV.
---
mafuckin cheeseburger eatin‚Äô ass
---
When your lvl 60, DM = Dire Maul.
---
Oop! Yeah, totally my fault. :D
---
Ok ok this post is really important, but let's go further ---- after people go back to reg servers, what kind of breakfast will they prefer?? Cinnamon toast or just regular toast?  
---
I came to this thread to ask the important questions following OPs lead. Thank you for guiding us, OP.
---
Classic requires a lot of time investment, you actually have to put in effort to get anywhere, that isn't something the current gaming community is used to, loot boxes, carries, free loot is all the rage.
---
The difference is none of that free stuff means a thing, but when you know you spent hours on hours farming/wiping/grinding for that item you eventually get, it means a hell of a lot.
---
If the gaming community get the same feeling then Classic will be a success, if they still prefer to login and open a box for a free epic then it probably won't be as big as it could be.
---
Silver linings amirite?

I'll second that. There we people who you would just log into the Ventrilo server to chat with even if you werent playing at that moment, or got to  know well enough that there as many conversations about life outside of the game as there were game-related. Because of who I was as a person at that time, I too fell out of touch with all of my guildies after leaving the game during WoTLK, my largest regret.
---
So far none of them have popped up on  [https://vanillafriends.com/](https://vanillafriends.com/)  , but here's to hoping!
---
Very good post indeed, Im much calmer now
---
Pathetic.  people dont know about ultima online, an actual hard mmo.
---
die?  lose all your stuff.
---
ask for help?  get teleported into a random dungeon by your "friends" with no way out surrounded by boxes.
---
How to get out?  contact a GM. 
---
how long does it take for a gm to come? 15 min - 9 hours
---
Whos even butthurt here? Only butthurt thread i saw was about joana not getting in which i kinda agree.
---
YUP. It's extra tilt when some greedy mage decides to roll on your wand drop you need.
---
Haha in vanilla I would always do all the delivery quest that take you to new areas cause I felt like they were easy xp, definitely made me level up slower.
---
OP, if you can find a pally buddy and test judgement of wisdom use on a target while shapeshifted.  I'm curious to see if druids can gain mana by attacking in shapeshifted forms.
---
It's all about the journey and there are journeys to be had right now! If you'll excuse me my current journey involves refeshing new posts.
---
Official account creation date - November 23rd, 2004  Launch Day. Although I played in the beta prior to that when the level cap was 25 or 30 or something low like that.  Long time ago.  LOL  \*cheers\*
---
Pagmats out for Harambe!
---
I never expected Asmongold to get 100k viewers running Dead Mines, but that happened, lets see whats to come.
---
Im going to try to read every quest-text in order to know whats going on. Sometimes its the small storys that are quite cool!
---
There's not a good way to describe it but if you google the term, the top term contains a definition "A casual player who hates advanced techniques and condescends towards players who use them. Often a bad player who judges good players for using techniques they cant or are unwilling to use."
---
It's going to come up for things no one should care about.
---
It's not even quality of life, they're just used to facerolling content in retail but that's not how classic works.
---
People feel entitled to it because hurr they are VETERANS (and given we are speaking about computer game it sounds cringeworthy).  
---
And especially given the fact that some streamers/influencers (that are unworthy) got the access
---
once classic is out ill never need to buy another game again.
---
classic for 2 years, tbc for 2 years, wotlk for 2 years, repeat
---
die a happy man
---
at that point you might as well pull a pandaria and just make Silvermoon a neutral city, with both sides getting elves.
---
I know they brought up undead speaking common as a reason for why not to do that (the idea was floated), but I still think it would've been better overall. the high elves having a portal to SW, and the blood elves having a portal to UC.
---
They could've even had some small racial differences in terms of their Mana ability. Since the High Elves endure their hunger for magic while the blood elves give into it.
---
Maybe have high elves have a passive feedback-like ability where using spells on them has a chance to cause them them to lash out and mana burn/silence the target with a cooldown, while the blood-elves keep their mana-tap/Arcane Torrent.
---
Similar in result but different in style. the High Elves power is defensive and result briefly losing control when attacked, while the Blood Elf power is something they can use when they desire it.
---
Giving up doesn't mean going back to regular servers (there are other games).
---
That said, I think Classic WoW will be something you come back to even if you get bored of it, or roll an alt, or change focus to something new like PvP if you haven't before. I don't think you'll have a considerable drop-down in player-base after the initial wave of tourists return to their respective homes.
---
most of this sub gets *nothing*.  not sarcasm, hyperbole, not any sort of joke.
---
i think most of the hate is going towards the streamers / content creators who are mostly not reporting bugs and using it just to promote their channel instead
---
Nothing about this should be news to anyone, but I guess some people need things explained to them more than once.
---
So you'd have to deal with a fucking terrible parser, as well as looking up NPCs to find to do shit to, and hope that they give you directions that are actually functional and actionable and not just vague, hey there are dudes around will give reward.
---
This guy has the most annoying voice I think I've ever heard. I'm not sure if his balls have even dropped yet. Jesus. 
---
Shit like this is why people always think streamers are immature kids.
---
There are many many people who believe it will become bigger than modern WoW. So it won‚Äôt be a surprise, but more of a ‚Äútold you so‚Äù.
---
Nah, I want to get totally blasted by nostalgia Aug 27th, the beta would take a lot of that away and maybe even burn me out
---
cierra la boca
---
Since im gonna be taking my time gettting up in levels, may as well make money while i stop to take in the view. Thanks for the guide.
---
To give players a chance to world pvp before grinding out 100000s of bgs
---
The pvp would get so bad on the weekends that it was impossible to level some days. It would take an hour or more to complete one quest because you were constantly in the middle of some massive pvp battle.
---
Currently, most speculate that the player base will increase drastically on launch and the month thereafter, slowly dropping off in numbers over the first year, then finally reaching a relatively stable player-base (not possible to know the actual numbers at this point). Casual players/those interested in trying it out will come and go (either flee back to retail or other games), but due to the time needed and grindy nature of classic, most who aren't attached/committed to Classic will likely leave before they hit level 40ish.
---
I never, ever liked Asmongold but his opinions on wow are pretty spot on with how the community feels.  He was somewhat ahead of his time with the complaints and sounded like a "crazy old man" but come bfa, he was spot on.
---
Snowball targeted on yourself also stops falling mid-air. that might be a private server issue tho :/
---
Fish (and their byproducts) are used in various professions. A lot of people also don't like fishing, making the materials relatively rare (and expensive). It's a great money maker, a great way to pass the time and just relax. I love it because there is always going to be unexpected downtime.
---
Waiting for a straggler in your dungeon  group? Fish.
---
Just miss the boat? Fish.
---
You can also fish up essence of water in Azshara, I believe. Might require the Elemental Invasion event though. Also  cooking obviously requires fish that provide valuable raid buffs.
---
Nah, I've even stopped on pserver because questing burns me out fast. I am going to try to get to cap as fast as I can although it probably won't be speed leveler rate. That will make it hard to avoid burnout so I adamantly don't want beta access. Of course if it worked by key like a lottery system I would totally try to get a key and give it away to someone who really wanted it. Like poor McFonnel. It made me a little sad to hear his disappointment when he wasn't in beta invite group 2. :(
---
Yeah, like It a painful to heal you but he does it anyway. Stone cold commitment.
---
That guy is annoying af. I hope it's just an act. He is angry and condescending when he says anything... even if he's 100% wrong about something.
---
Oh man I remember loot lagging across the NE starting area...
---
You listed 30 years worth of activities. Either you're 45-50 years old or you plan on dying young.
---
I've quit retail and am very excited for classic, but I gotta admit I love me some pet battling
---
I don‚Äôt even like him and I was watching
---
Biggest takeaway from this post.
---
I don't know about useful information but someone that has tens of thousands viewing them is certainly universally boring.
---
I believe that was removed iirc
---
i'd like to know this too but i have to say it's very unlikely this will be the case, for instance you could wall jump in karazhan to skip bosses so i don't think blizz is going to let people do this in classic
---
Ah gotcha. Right on.
---
&gt; Classic was the most accessible time to play WoW for casuals.
---
Completely backward
---
Havent heard about this discord, that sounds brilliant. Would you mind linking? If its not too much to ask. :)
---
Or a warrior, who says "you were probably just going to sell it on the AH anyway, it's a blue BoE either everyone need or everyone greed"... Had that happen to me on a Jaina's Firestarter.
---
Classic will be bigger than Fortnite.
---
For some reason, it meant a lot to me that Asmongold enjoyed dark souls.
---
I dont know if he played 2 or bloodborne, but I watched him play 1 and 3
---
I needed this.
---
I have zero interest in the beta. Loosing all my progress would be sould crushing. I'll wait for the game. O
---
Most likely no
---
Unless bliZZ leaves it as an esteem egg
---
Maybe he meant the chain where you get the offhand to purge the shield off that warlock whose name sounds like Mor'Ladim but isn't.
---
There will probably be pvp guilds yes, especially in phase 1. World pvp will also be a major thing.. especially in phase 1 lol. Even afterwards world pvp will persist as players fight over valuable resources like Black Lotus or a specific grinding spot like the cultists in Silithis or the Winterspring furbolgs.
---
My limit was reached so fast on pserver due to gold spam, I hope it's increased.
---
That's not weird at all. Read the statement again. Account age is a factor **in both directions** because they want players with a variety of experiences. They don't just want Vanilla grognards, they want subsets if players of varying experiences. So yeah, that's going to include some number of Legion players and BFA players.
---
what was there? i could never get in
---
The female Tauren looks more like a human. Rather then a wall of meat and sinew. If you didn't grow up watching Arnold movies. It can be a turn off. For me I would have it no other way. The bigger my shoulders the more bad ass I become.
---
spamming the same tired jokes wasnt vanilla/blizzlike?
---
1.8 warrior talent rework and 1.10 itemization changes to preraid gear had a lot to do with it.
---
Add Talesavo while theyre at it
---
I became an engineer and have a 6 figure salary, where did I go wrong PepeHands
---
If weird, be really rich
---
Thank you! :)

We don't know. Walljumping was functionally entirely gone by Cataclysm, and this isn't actually 1.12 but rather a recreation of 1.12 in the modern infrastructure. Since walljumping was an "exploit" dependent upon the old coding, it may be the case that Blizzard would need to actively *decide* to reintroduce that exploit. But they may in fact do that to preserve authenticity.
---
Nobody in the beta I'm yet aware of has tested either prolonged vertical walljumping or sideways walljumping. So maybe it's possible, and maybe it's not.
---
Hes a fattie. He‚Äôd just bounce it off his chest. Range of motion would be 1/5th of a real rep
---
That‚Äôs true as well
---
the biggest disappointment with modern wow is that it doesn't feel like an mmorpg. the phasing and sharding tech combined with LFR/LFD are the worst things to happen to wow since it makes the game feel a lot smaller. i wish they could come up with some kind of server squish and use layering tech instead of sharding
---
i think it‚Äôs going to kill Retail
---
Just go 2 hand fury. Then you get improved slam. Arms is still dog shit
---
Its fun to watch, but I agree. Save my gaming for the real burrito.
---
YES!
---
i think once the majority is 60 we will see 19,29,etc Twink-Guilds coming up again.
---
Thanks for saving the world from evil, you're a true hero
---
I remember for a while Defensive Stance would save you at any height because -10% reduced damage taken took fall damage into account.
---
But not much stamina
---
retail WoW isn‚Äôt good so where‚Äôs the arguement
---
It'd better in Classic, because it still does in Retail.  Heroic Leap also does, but Charging critters has saved me so many times it's definitely my go-to.
---
It depends on where you are.  I‚Äôm in Europe and the lag wasn‚Äôt unbearable for me at peak times.  Nor was it that crowded at those numbers really.  It just meant every zone was populated
---
Bigger than "anyone" expected; I guess not since many, many people expected it to be a big hit. Sure, there also are many who have predicted it will be a fad or a fizzle, and some of them may be surprised. But I think there are lots and lots of players who fully expected it to be a huge hit, and whose expectations will be proven spot on. Everything in the way of actual reaction to it that we've seen so far confirms that.
---
Will it be "bigger than retail?" I mean, maybe. I kinda doubt it, at least long term. But it doesn't need to do much to justify the expense of making it happen, which in the grand scheme of things is surely little more than a rounding error on Blizzard's financials. And it certainly will attract enough people back to the game just to pay Classic, and who will pay a subscription to do that, so it will be a net plus for Blizzard financially for as long as they want to run it. It certainly will do well enough to pay its way for a long time, at least as long as WoW is a thing at all.
---
However, I think one thing that is not being said as much right now, but which will be in hindsight, is that Classic launch is shaping up to be the biggest thing that has happened in the MMO market as a whole in a long, long time. It's going to embarass the shit out of a lot of "new" games that have launched in recent years, because it offers something that a ton of people want, in a polished package, backed by a AAA development team, without any of the disgusting money grubbing F2P bullshit that has ruined so many otherwise good modern games. Even at the low end of realistic expectations for it, it's going to hit numbers that almost any other game in this market would kill for, and it's got far less ground to make up in recouping the minimal cost to get it out the door. This is what I think cannot be oversold right now, that Classic definitely will be an historic, once in a generation moment in gaming, and the best thing to happen to MMOs generally in ages.
---
I can tell you that I never played Vanilla, and never played WoW at all before 2015. But I will be playing Classic, and it's the first MMO launch I've been hyped about in forever. In a way I feel fortunate because, to me, it's a totally new game, so I get to enjoy something I never got to see back in the day. But I'm excited about it mainly because I know that its going to feel huge with all the people who are crowding in to try it, and even when the novelty wears off the game certainly will have a healthy and lasting community of people who will continue to play it. I'm sure I am not alone in this situation, and I won't be alone in game on launch day either.
---
There is an in game but reporting system.
---
What is the point in posting these bugs on an unofficial website? Are blizzard monitoring this thread?
---
Nobody ever complains about heroic raids being to hard. And modern raids are more difficult and versetaile than vanilla ever was. What the hell are you talking about?
---
The People simply want their time investements in the Game to matter once again. And not being reduced to the start lines every time a new Raid Tier arrives.
---
I would LOVE retail with vanilla Progression design.
---
YouTube "grtting into hyjal" or something. Literally was a whole zone that was empty. There was something really exciting about it, at least to me.
---
It's literally a fully rendered Hyjal modeled after WC3, complete with the destroyed Nordrassil. And at the top of the mountain there's a little construction workhorse with an "In development" sign, as an Easter egg.
---
Got back to playing wow back in 2015 by creating a new account then eventually linked my old vanilla account which i created in november 2004  to that battle.net account. Just got my beta invite yesterday so i believe they take the oldest wow account into consideration.
---
&gt;My god, how is he "The face" of classic?
---
Fuck if I know, all I know is he kept claiming he's one of the best Warriors in NA during Vanilla (PServers), which we have clear evidence, is not even close to being the case.
---
What tilts me the most, is how he keeps reporting missing features from Retail WoW, as something Vanilla should of had, like quest helper (Arrows to guide you).
---
He has no experience when it comes to anything Vanilla related, and it shows.
---
Never posted this
---
Egh, let‚Äôs keep flying!
---
Be sure to sign and share this petition: https://www.change.org/p/blizzard-what-many-are-trying-to-achieve-is-getting-an-rp-pvp-server-when-wow-classic-releases
---
We are almost at 1000 signatures!
---
And yet people say the only reason people like Vanilla is rose tinted glasses.  Hello?
---
Uh, in his warrior deep dive video he said "I never tank." Where did he sell himself as being prot?
---
Just so everyone is aware. There is no such thing as ‚Äúworld PvP‚Äù
---
World PvP just means ganking
---
In the exact same situation here. I'll be biting the thorium shell and rolling horde with the homies though because playing with friends turns vanilla from an amazing game, to the GOAT.
---
I wonder if let‚Äôs say if Billy (obviously not me) used a hack back in Wrath that gave a 24h suspension and got a warning for buying gold negates the chance of getting an invite ü§î I hope not, for Billy‚Äôs sake.
---
Depends on what you are into. As someone whose primary fun comes from world pvp, I still consider vanilla the best.
---
Also using blink to kill your forward motion while Slow Fall is active so that you can land on a dime.
---
Ive never been a fan of Asmongold. Soda ive seen reporting bugs. Hes the only streamer who plays classic cause he loves classic. 
---
Im just getting annoyed by the " IVe been subbed since 2005, Wheres my invite" relax bruv youll play it in a few months.
---
That's when you let em die on the next pull and say "my b cooldowns"
---
He ended on "repeat" so it never ends
---
Good news! I‚Äôm playing beta and that community is back!
---
When I played vanilla, I could have sworn people still called it VC. I never understood why because I was extremely casual. Are any other dungeons called by the final boss?
---
I know that for me personally, I will never go back to retail unless it's temporary.  So maybe on their next expansion I would check it out, etc but I'm really only interested in Classic.  I am in between "casual" and "no life".  Definitely not causal but definitely not hardcore.
---
you'll get there mate! Trust me im eager to play... i really do but 3 months i can waiit and play retail till then :)
---
OP just posted a link from 2005 so obviously not.
---
most dungeons are pretty linear tbh. WC is the only one people seem to get lost in. if you wipe it's only because you pulled too many mobs, or if the healer doesn't heal you, not because you didn't shield bash a target at the right moment. tanking is very easy in wow once you get used to keeping aggro on targets. most raids have very easy tanking mechanics, some are simple as just standing there and spamming sunder armor while the raid kills the boss. few fights require taunt rotations or moving out of stuff.
---
I just want the full release
---
At first I was like... She's drunk ... Then I was like ohhhh okay. Then I was like, i want wine.
---
You and me both, I don't even wanna watch the streams!  I want to keep all the excitement for release!!
---
You just give it a go. Tell people first time tanking this instance and you give it the ol‚Äô college try.
---
You will wipe... a lot.
---
But you learn to be better. It could of been the time but people were bit nicer in Vanilla (sure you still had jerks) but because it was a smaller tighter community, word could spread easier of a toxic player. 
---
Overall, don‚Äôt stress it, people are generally patient, especially at earlier levels.
---
For that authentic RPPvP feel, the servers need to be added way after release. Because clearly, Blizz knows best that RPs aren't PvPers, and vice versa.
---
A lifetime and yesterday!
---
I can't wait to get back in, and sort of worried about how much I'm gonna get pulled in, hah.
---
Not playing a ret paladin this time around though haha.  Not worth the harassment.
---
People are going to freak when a raid boss takes 40 people to kill and only 2 pieces of loot drop.
---
This is next level sweaty. We‚Äôre in the end game now
---
This "streamers are not reporting bugs" lets be honest I bet the majority of people don't, but they are making it out as if they are the saints and would be reporting every little thing.
---
In all honesty, unless you have been playing private servers recently then how would you know if something isn't right, I started in BC, but I wouldn't remember if a rare was standing in the correct area or if a buff wasn't acting as it should.
---
People are calling it out as if a Blizzard member is in chat giving those calling streamers out beta access.
---
the only one responsible here is Blizzard
---
I Think for 6 months, maybe a year, it will be huge and then rapidly die down simply because weve done it before and nothing new is coming to it.
---
I tried in multiple spots, I could not do it.
---
That's probably why the level cap is at 30 in the beta right now. High enough to test a lot of mechanics but even the dedicated classic streams will be done with it in maybe a month.
---
thanks OP this helped me
---
Maybe on your server. It definitely wasn't that way on mine.
---
You overcome it by not giving a fuck what others think or say. If you want to tank tank. If you suck keep tanking and get better. If you don't know the path do what everyone else does. Ask or learn through doing. Explore the unknown that's what classic is about
---
Stop projecting.
---
I wish I could add my voice to the chorus there, but I haven't had an active account since '09, nor am I interested in changing that until Classic launches.
---
I can only hope Blizz still has folks checking on things over here so they're aware of the feedback from folks like me who can't make noise on their own forums.
---
Bullshit. Did you even play on a Vanilla PvP server? Team battles weren't uncommon at all, and entire raids would fight each other in places like Blackrock Mountain or Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs taking it too far.  Play how you want to, right? However as a casual player that isn‚Äôt bothered by advanced players...I would STILL encourage playing casually.  I think competitive influence can be toxic.
---
i believe all that was required was noggenfroger to get to hyjal 
---
did it a few times back in the day i dont think any wall jumping was required
---
im not sure , assuming its the propper vanilla map it should be possible
---
if i could get in it would be the first thing i test.
---
this sort of stuff is important to me because going there with friends were great memories
---
Excellent news! Thanks for doing this research!
---
Thank Mangos staff if you're going to thank anyone
---
Tell your group:
---
"My first time here guys, anyone else know the way around?"
---
And you'll learn, and sooner rather than later you'll be the one showing others around.
---
Remember the Rust Storm? It was going to clean out all the bots!
---
Yeah, I *think* it was just pvp titles until a mid-BC patch added Scarab Lord (retroactively), Hand of A'dal, and Champion of the Naaru.
---
&gt; that isn't something the current gaming community is used to 
---
I wouldnt say that for the gaming community as a whole, look to subs of strategy games all over reddit, they tend to want the game to be the hardest and most punishing it can be while still being winable. Shit Eu4 had an achievment so hard they emplyeed the first guy who finished it legit.
---
Would be interesting if he also showed the "high" settings of WoW Classic (he is running the "classic" settings)
---
Problem is not starting in p2 the real headache is going to belong to ppl level 52 when phase 2 comes. Sins they actually give rep so count on being ganked an corpse camped  and all you're flightmasers being dead
---
One option is to roll those classes and spec dps to learn, then respec later. Another is to just jump in! Ask questions, let people know you're learning. You might encounter some jerks, sure, but often times people will help. Don't let the fear of someone being mean online stop you from doing what you love! I started in BC, and 4 days later a friend got me a raid spot as a bear. I didn't even know what agro meant. The group "taught me" by telling me to run face first and pull the boss in shadow labs...you know the room. I cried through the whole thing, but I pulled it off. The guild lead rage logged cause he had wanted to see me fail. Those people mean nothing. Learn, get other groups. Most importantly, have fun! You'll learn the maps and pulls in no time. Best of luck, friend!
---
i'll still rush and enjoy it. thanks for the wall of text on how to play the game tho
---
The biggest change, IMO, was away from open world PvP to instanced battlegrounds. Not being able to find the rogue in a battleground means they aren't actually contributing...
---
It affects dev time, which could be better used for the real issues.
---
I mean this is blizzard this isn't a p server.  There isn't going to be gold spam lol.  Those accounts will be perma'd almost instantly with the reporting system.
---
i was fascinated by that area back during vanilla and tried to get in but was never able. i guess i never looked up a guide lol
---
Yes. You need to be in range and get the full animation off.
---
Theres a post like this every week..
---
This needs more exposure. Good work!
---
asmon can be pretty funny sometimes but his personality is kind of annoying. asmon i think does enjoy vanilla. there was a bit of nostalgia for him, but even asmon didn't start playing until 2006 a bit before BC came out so there's a large element to vanilla he never experienced.
---
i wish kungen was around because his streams about vanilla were hilarious and amazing, but he has/had a lot of mental issues he was public about and i haven't seen him stream for a couple years now; but he was arguably the best tank in vanilla and very knowledgeable.
---
My account has my original vanilla R14 mage leveled to 110 on it.. part of me feels like if I resub this might give me a edge to get in, but I still can‚Äôt see paying $15 for just a ‚Äúchance.‚Äù
---
These threads have nothing to do with anything, the invites were a phased roll out and all sorts of people are getting in now. The beta is three months long please stop these stupid petitions
---
Yep. There's the green agi polearm that drops there though.
---
&gt;most dungeons are pretty linear tbh. WC is the only one people seem to get lost in.
---
And BRD. And Scholo. And Mara. And ST.
---
There were many nonlinear, expansive dungeons in Vanilla. That's part of their charm.
---
&gt;  Hes the only streamer who plays classic cause he loves classic.
---
Yea, lets ignore all the streamers who have been playing pservers for years, they obviously don't love classic, right?
---
Did he have demon skin/armor on? thats an extra regen and the denominator there is 4 not the regular 5.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Health_regeneration
---
Here's the table you most likely used. You can see warriors OOC regen was cazy in vanilla to where it was the only class nerfed in TBC
---
Yeah, that's definitely gonna suck.
---
Casual influence is far more toxic and is responsible for the destruction of many game systems. It's literally why retail is the way that it is.
---
"I don't know it for a fact, I just know it's true..."
---
I certainly wouldn‚Äôt mind being in the beta, however I‚Äôm definitely not willing to have to pay to test somebody else‚Äôs product.
---
Mainly it's a way for observers of people's streams that don't have access to report bugs if streamers if miss them themselves.
---
Just LoS them.
---
I contacted support and they gave me a timestamp.
---
You‚Äôre a hipster tips hater.
---
Hah lol. I do think i have a special place for it since I've grown up with wow, and i think only a certain type of people are gunna enjoy vanilla. That said this type of mmo is rly not avaliable especially on the scope of wow classic. And I think alot of new people are gunna enjoy it.
---
It gives a chance for other people to test and confirm or deny these suspicions so as to keep from bogging down Blizzard with bug reports that aren't bugs, and can server as a warning to other people. I.e., "Hey atm if you're wearing this item and kill this mob your character just straight up dies and your computer crashes." Is Something useful to know before Blizzard puts out a fix.
---
Literally every streamer is profiting of stolen IP, retail streamer or not.
---
The lag was already unbearable even before the end.
---
I can't remember if it was 2015 or 2016, but I played during the summer one time long before the server closed, and the server lag was just horrendous. Like a 1 second delay on every single action, when the population got up above 7k. Thankfully it was playable at night when the pop dropped back down to 5k or so.
---
99% streamers will quit, so will there following...
---
I worry more under population after the 1 month hype, then over population on lunch day.
---
I think a month of level 30 runs is too much, and once they raise the level cap all bets are off.
---
This is a great point, your with 4 other people, just ask which way when you come to a fork.
---
I have PTR: World of Warcraft showing. That's retail's ptr, right? I didn't download battle.net until after beta invites started going out.
---
Yeah, its a big game. Plenty of room for many types of players.
---
Thanks! Did you get in?
---
i'm actually really looking forward to him retooling his guides so they're accurate now that he has the time to test it all out in beta.
---
But 110% is too much :-P
---
The abundance of improper animations worries me
---
im planning to use a guide mostly because of quest chains that go across zones.  
---

---
well summarizes it.
---
holy shit
---
Ganking and World PvP are two different and distinctive things. Ganking usually involves 1-2 people maliciously camping and harassing players for no reason. World PvP tends to be larger scale, with an exact purpose such as defending crafting material nodes or raid and dungeon entrances. 
---
You‚Äôve must have had some bad experiences which I am sorry for.
---
I would buy a thunderfury cheese knife, but that looks like a cocktail weenie toothpick
---
i actually want to create a couple addons which i wont have time to at release
---
Agreed. It's prolly faster to wait another 30 mins for a tank than to try with a shaman.
---
Similar story, old vanilla account. Haven't subbed since tbc, got a month of game time a few days ago, got in the beta last night!
---
That hour of RP I did in goldshire really payed off
---
He got in as an influencer.
---
At least 1 people.
---
&gt;VC is more of a cata thing. 
---
Uhh no it's not? People just queued dungeon finder in Cata and didn't think about it. 
---
[Here's a guide from 2006 for Deadmines specifically referring to it as "VS" or "VanCleef"](https://archive.fo/y9uGG)
---
IDK why people constantly say this, but it's just simply false. Yeah, DM was mostly Dire Maul for Horde for reasons I stated above, **but for Alliance is was considered VC** in vanilla after DM came out because you would constantly get whispers from people at first asking "Dire Maul or Deadmines?". I played Alliance and I specifically remember this... 
---
The claim that it didn't start until Cata is not only baseless but completely obsured.
---
Imo mists was the last expansion I had fun in. While I dislike the scenery and raids felt more on the meh whatever side (compared to killing ragnaros or lich king), the classes were very fun to play and I really enjoyed timeless isle.
---
WoD sucked ass and I didn't enjoy legion much either. Bfa is well.. yea
---
I'm not even sure I want to play rppvp, but I do know the most fun I had pvping was on an rppvp server. It's glorious.
---
The warriors arent' high enough level to have Intercept either and I don't think Esfand had the paladin execute ability (can't remember the name) yet either or he would have used it.
---
Solution: Move away from the mob and then drink.
---
But really, the only time mobs would respawn in less than 10 seconds was at launch when every single 1-10 zone had 2000+ people in it. Right now, mobs don't spawn anywhere near that fast even with a lot of people around, I think the minimum respawn time is around 30 seconds.
---
i played it back in the day. I don't wanna have that nostalgia ruined by seeing too much now. Ive been looking forward to this for a long time so 4 more months is survivable
---
Some I assume are good people.
---
Probably 50 people on a good day 53
---
This is misinformation
---
I think it‚Äôs the opposite.  The vocal minority of hardcore players are toxic as fuck.  Retail took it too far in terms of phasing and instancing everything, but making content accessible to those who play a lot less hours per week was a good direction.
---
There must be a balance.  I liked WOTLK, personally.
---
Ench for pvp or pve shenanigans
---
nobody ever said hey lets do DM and mean dire maul, u either said DM east,west or north.
---
Rushing to 60 isn't fun but, thats the best part of classic. Every part of the game demands to be taken seriously. So you can think it's fun to rush. While I think it's fun to stop and smell the roses. As opposed to retail where I can get fucked. It's all about the rush.
---
That is the beauty of classic. We all win friend, we all win.
---
I think if you want to be an Enh Shaman you should be the best one anyone has ever seen.
---
I think data supports this conclusion
---
Ok I only played retail until wotlk
---
Have you ever been to the wow sub reddit and the wow forums? It‚Äôs full of people that actually think retail is too difficult.
---
In PvE its not viable. Sometimes a raid might decide to bring one to swing Nightfall, but thats about it.
---
In PvP Enhancment Shamans are alright, but the build is kind of memey. Elemental is better and more consistent.
---
Exactly.  I can see why retail players wouldn‚Äôt like Classic.  They‚Äôre completely different games.  There is a market for both.  It‚Äôs just that Classic is not a type of game that is made any more
---
Only thing making me consider RP servers. I'm already anticipating the shitfest that will be launch on PVP servers.
---
easily the best thing about gnome
---
I subscribed In  Hope's of getting Into beta. I really want to play the game and figure out what class I want to main. 
---
I'm torn between prot warrior, shadow priest or enhance shaman.
---
What kind of druid
---
Is hunter dead zone back?
---
Well in retrospect yes, but at the moment of quitting I wasn't just taking a break. I fully intended to and stopped playing for extended periods of time, I was trying to portray the mindset I  had with the game at the time of stopping. I was quitting because I didnt enjoy it, rather than taking a break to wait for the next patch.
---
Can't believe how clueless this guy is! Anyone who played the actual vanilla knows this boss in particular hits extremely hard. If you don't land a heal or the tank doesn't use a defensive ability after their first hit you can definitely get two shotted, especially at their level.
---
Same.  I always hate having to delete a gold spammer to make room on my ignore list for an actual, non-spam ignore.
---
There's a weekly LFG thread and a Discord link, both in the sidebar.
---
Two servers, PVP and PVE - population says "low" for both
---
I'm expecting the first week to have something like two million discrete players.
---
By the six month mark I'd be surprised if there are more than a quarter million dedicated players.
---
True, true, I would say that definitely explains some of the streamer hostility, but there still seems to be a lot of misinterpreting social interactions of the streamers specifically that makes me think that this could be why. I'm not trying to be insulting either honestly, I just think it's genuinely the case that more niche nerdy games like this tend to have higher representation of people on the spectrum .
---
yeah that level 60 that wanna do all of DM in a single go, east west and north.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law
---
best way to tell is just to sign open battle.net launcher and click on the region tab to see if you have it.
---
&gt;  And their "free" mount at lvl 40
---
What do you mean "free" ? It literally is free, it doesn't cost anything. You just go to the trainer and learn it from a quest.
---
Because those things are sometimes hard to catch through text, with just a single post. Sarcasm isn't always clear in text, because people _know_ there are a lot of stupid people in the world. So it wouldn't be farfetched if someone held a ludicrous opinion.
---
As a warrior you could charge and not take damage right? So, start a duel with your buddy and have them go to the bottom and charge them right before you hit.
---
The only LoS in this area are inside buildings, so yeah thanks for proving my point lol.  Obviously you can get by without dying here, but it's risky.
---
Why are you taking offence to this? Sorry ill elaborate. Soda has more passion than any other streamer. Of courseee other streamers love classic. but when you join sodas stream you know he just wants the best for wow..  and the general love for wow. When other streamers promote Classic for there own benefit. 
---
only other streamer i can really pull that from is Swifty.
---
Same here man!
---
I haven't bought/done much probably? I've been unsubbed for a total of like four years too since vanilla.
---
More like ahead of the curve. He's always spouted nonsense.

---
280.049 people if you want to be exact.
---
&gt; Not to mention the level 25-45 deadzone where the only good wands are BoE world drops that sell for 20-100g, or lucky drops off rare dungeon bosses.
---
You can make or buy some wands from Enchanters. One at 26 and another at 30. Nothing after that I think, though.
---
Explain this? because retail is firmly in the hands of blizzard = not stolen?
---
Due to class halls and artifacts, I felt Legion made all the classes feel far more interesting and fun to play.
---
Kiting in pvp and pve are different.
---
Generally in pvp, cheetah will get you killed because any damage will daze you.
---
In pvp, when range is closed (and it will be closed) you want to have Aspect of the Monkey on, wing clip, and continue kiting. If you get hamstring, you feign death + freezing trap.
---
It really is surprising, the sheer amount of doomsaying / naysaying about Classic.
---
*"HAHA GAME SUCKS IT'S JUST ROSE TINTED GLASSES NOSTALGIA YOU WERE JUST A KID YOU'RE NOT A KID ANYMORE YOU'RE TRYING TO RE-LIVE YOUR CHILDHOOD YOU WON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY IT'S NOT 2005 ANYMORE YOU'RE NOT NEW ANYMORE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE STOP LIKING THINGS I DON'T LIKE"*
---
etc.
---
YUP AND IT WORKEDüí™
---
Personally I feel there is a lot of interest given how many of us who played during Vanilla talk about it.
---
But once people see how long things take and it doesn't rain epics the population will shrink. By how much remains to be seen.
---
I just hope it's enough of a success to be viable in the long term. By that I mean your able to find groups, pvp, and raid 6 months after launch.
---
I'm going to give you a very secret recipe to being a good tank:
---
"Imagine the dumbest thing your group can do at any point in time. Then be prepared for them to do it."
---
Boy it would be stupid if nobody interrupted that spell? Have your finger on your interrupt.
---
Who'd be dumb enough to pull that pat over there? Get ready to pick up aggro.
---
It'd be an awful idea for the healer to oom himself healing idiots standing in fire? Be ready to use cooldowns and potions.
---
Tons of pvp guilds
---
One thing that I always find odd is why do people assume that just because there are newer games, old ones stop being fun? Sure some games truly don't age well, but many do. 
---
A game that was good enough to be a phenomenon like WoW obviously has to be good enough to survive a little out-dated graphics. 
---
All other "quality of life" stuff is mostly just design choices that may or may not actually improve the overall experience.
---
I have reported a few bugs so far and all I see in guild chat are people focusing on speed leveling, showing no interest in the bugs.  It is a little disheartening.
---
If that's the same guy from p servers, he is indeed very good.
---
No because I expect it to be huge already
---
&gt;  would for the sake of Rogues being OP already want to be changed.
---
Rogues OP xD
---
i think at first it's going to be very popular especially with people just logging in to see what the fuss is about. i think most current wow players will be disappointed with the lack of QoL changes that exist in modern wow and will go back to modern wow. i still think classic will have a very healthy playerbase though as people who don't like modern wow will sub just to play classic
---
You can't get that from moo, perplexity or kraun?
---
I played vanilla to level 27 and my parents told me I couldn't play anymore so I stopped until MoP does that count
---
Remember what happened to SW Galaxies when it got watered down? Took an awesome game and flushed it down the toilet.
---
You can dig in quite a lot to some stuff. Maybe not as much as details for sure, but it has enough information for me like breakdowns on who took damage from what, who did how much damage to what target, breakdown of DPS contributions from spells/procs, min/max hits/crits. Death log breakdowns, etc. Very easy right/left click navigation and nothing more is needed to access every piece of info I need.
---
Details did not give me this same sense of ease of finding information, and I was often stuck trying to figure out how to navigate it. As well, the ElvUI inforbar toggle button for Skada is one click to show, one click to hide. Which is multiple clicks for Details and becomes tedious.
---
Ok here goes.  Open ended question really.   I've played a RDruid since 1.07 patch.   In legion I started a HPriest alt and loved its play style. I mained both for entire legion and start of BFA (till they gutted binding heal).  Now with classic rolling back.   Can someone try and sell me on HPriest vs RDruid?
---
I vaguely remember hearing something that between vanilla and wotlk 16 million players tried and quit wow. If a tenth of them come back that's enough players to make most MMO RPGs jealous.
---
I've seen posts constantly not only through reddit other social media of 
---
"ive been subbed since 2005, i need a beta invite" or something similar.
---
Cata was fun for me because it returned us to Azeroth and it felt fresh for the first time in years. The 5 mans weren't faceroll and required pull planning and cc. 
---
I don't get why people shit on Cata beyond their dislike of flying &amp; their nostalgia for the classic zones.
---
tranquilizing shot,  mob kiting, traps and to call them huntard
---
If you watched the video on the topic you might understand that there is a place for it, and that he doesn‚Äôt recommend it outside of certain circumstances.
---
Skarm is a very respected and knowledgeable tank. Bosses die in a very short amount of time at his level, dps benefits immensely from the tps increase, heals in turn can now chaincast heals on the very short fights without ooming (and also dont end up bored, which is more dangerous). 
---
Shields are also basically 2000 armor and some block chance- block chance really isnt incredibly useful single target (though the tank may need to shield block if things get dicey). The armor can be maintained via an elixir.
---
Tranq shot.
---
Million
---
i plan on rolling a Night Elf Priest. my original character for Vanilla was a Night Elf Druid and i leveled as Restoration for... some reason, so, i'm gonna be used to the slow TTK pace and all that. plus, in my original stint in WoW, i played a Druid from Vanilla to WoTLK... and Benediction is looks cool as fuck, so.
---
There are more classes to choose from :D
---
Rogue's fall damage reduction works the same exact way Druid's does.
---
Pulling, with the talent choice they have the longest range of any class. Safest class to use for pulling. Also they can pull to the tanks and then FD to drop aggro. Also tranq shot like others have said.
---
I got home from work at 10pm EST. Found my account was flagged for beta. I'm also from 2004.
---
He is not poor guy, if he pretend to be the poor and noobie ;) this beta made a lot of ppl (me as well) unsub forever after those fails. Sorry but he called himself the best NA warrior... uff..... git gud
---
Back in classic it wasn't always about the most damage done. Classes were brought based on their utilities. Not everyone had a stun / cc / or heals.
---
it makes even less sense for the night elves to go to the alliance
---
Except for tranq rotations...
---
I‚Äôm just trying to enjoy the game as whole since I never got to experience back in the day, pvp of course but i also am a mythic raider.
---
What do you mean normal arming time lol. It was down for a good one second dude.
---
Then you aren't in the no change camp
---
I know this might be a weird concept. But some guilds also bring people because they like them, even if they play a non top dps class :O
---
Cause i never got one for any expansion lol
---
Good to know thanks!  I‚Äôm more excited I got my old account back, so not too worried about beta.  I thought it was long gone lol
---
Because not everyone is a turbo-nerd that min/maxes every aspect of their groups/raids
---
U do know he has 2 bubbles and lay on hands right?
---
Ehhh, Soda's doing it for profit too, this isnt a line in the sand its a slide bar from 
---
"Sell out" &lt;-----&gt; "Loves product"
---
I‚Äôm afraid to commit that heavily but I also love rogues IM TORN
---
people seem to forget that wow was designed around the casual player. if you played mmorpgs before wow, like UO or DAoC or EQ, it was a LOT more punishing. in UO for instance, if you died, people could loot every piece of item you had on your body. they could cut up the corpse and take your head and display it on their house if they wanted to. you could have stuff stolen from you and even be killed in the safe zones if they were willing to suicide to take you down. in DAoC and EQ, dying meant you lost exp. you could even die so much you would de-level. mobs were a lot harder, there was no hearth stone, travel was limited. a lot of people just ran on foot. when wow came out, it was considered to be extremely casual friendly. you die, you run back to your body and get to keep all your loot, that's it. look at wow now. wow now is SUPER casual.
---
Player vs player, who starts it and for what reason is irelevant.
---
Significant doubts on this being true. Thanks for linking this to me!
---
Yeah I mean, it‚Äôs gonna be a lot worse on classic lol.
---
I mean phase 3, when WSG and AV are out but AB is not.
---
I'm actually torn between alliance and horde.
---
I use to play alliance back in the day.
---
On one hand, I'll have new experiences playing horde.
---
On the other hand, I'll have to be playing the worst faction in all Azeroth...
---
Tough decision.
---
If it costed them a lot of time I doubt they'd include it. As this is the modern client being heavily altered, it probably was not a big deal to keep. They probably accidentally deleted a file that was important for it, which might be an easy fix. I also agree that the time could be better spent, but I think it'll be fine
---
Play what you want the most. Get a raidspot by being friendly and helpful.
---
It must be an addon that changes the font.
---
Yeah molten core you need more then 1
---
I was planning on taking my time, but this release date really f‚Äôed me.
---
Traveling out of town for 2 weeks a week after release, then traveling out of town for a straight month a week after that.
---
I‚Äôm going to have to no-life for that first week and weekend to ensure that I can keep up with my friends. Also, I‚Äôll have to look into getting a cheap laptop for gaming....
---
..... the fact you believe this saddens me.
---
Also whelp room in BWL super helpful
---
I'm going to make the assumption they'll just do the same thing they did in WoTLK and implement a teleport out to in front of the demons in WS as soon as you enter the chat channel for Hyjal.

Well if you‚Äôre just trying to enjoy the game you can roll whatever class you want.  There will be guilds that take all classes and specs to raid and pvp with as not everyone is looking to min/max raids and filling a 40 slot raid can be a pain every week.  
---
As a feral you‚Äôll never be even close to top dps, that‚Äôs just how it works in vanilla but that doesn‚Äôt mean you still can‚Äôt have fun with it.  Rogues will be very good for dps in all areas as well.
---
People are very receptive to questions.  Ask and you shall receive.  When you try to lie about knowing and waste everyones time wiping thats when people will flame you.
---
Always ask we will all help
---
I think it'll be huge at the jump &amp; quite a few people will take off after the first month or two.
---
After about six months you'll be able to see what the numbers are like &amp; how many people stick with it.
---
Tried with DXVK or without? Thanks for your testing btw!
---
These are mail... I equip?
---
Delicious!
---
Tried on wine 4.x?
---
!remind me 3 months
---
I know, it's almost like some of us play MMORPGs because we enjoy social interaction, and not just getting your numbers as high as possible.
---
I also can't wait for the Master chief collection for PC! My buddies always tell me the only fps they are good at is Halo. So I can't wait to see how that pans out!
---
100%, guys. He does too much damage! /s
---
They arn't necessarily wrong about Classic / TBc or honestly any point in wow being grindy. THe difference however is before legion the grind had an end point. You could get your BIS, or drop or rep or whatever and you no longer had to do that content unless you specifically still wanted to (i did Kara weekly even into sunwell, partly for gold from badges but mostly just because it was fun). In Post legion that is unobtainable because of garbage like M+ ,artifact power / Azerite shit, legendaries and titanforging. Reaching a point where you are "done" especially as someone who is a Mythic progression raider never happens. There were times in this games history where i just enjoyed doing shit whether it was leveling alts or grinding reps, or mounts or whatever that i would play 8-14 hours a day. Once blizzard essentially handed down a mandate that i HAD to play that much i was done.
---
Quests weren't the main source of exp, mobs were. Most of leveling was grouped up camping a spawn.
---
**Classic won't fail, why? It has already been validated and proven by private servers that it works, and people want it.**
---
However it might not have the population people think it will, it will be less after the hype dies down.
---
99% of streamers will quit after few weeks, after launch, most of them won't even reach 60, because wow classic is time consuming, and it's bad for streaming business.... You need to play the hype, and chase the hype to be a streamer...
---
**I myself will be playing classic wow for personal reasons and realistic goals and not hype, I played it when it was in closed alpha, and beta, and on release, I was there when it all started, and I will be there when it starts again, and I do know what to expect...**
---
I did all quests on the horde side, and I do remember all of them still to this day for all horde races, I don't need no quest guide, I am the quest guide, back then there was no quest guides, you had to read the actual quests, will I do raids? Prob not, it was pure cancer back then, also I did them all, will I do every 5-10 man dungeon, for sure, they were my best memory's.
---
I had two of these I never opened. I kept them in my highschool bedroom all these years.. Recently moving old items into my house I found them in a box and they had caved in/lost some fluid and become all crushed/odd looking. Shame, I threw them away after holding on to them for such a long time. I wish they were in a metal can instead.
---
I like how people still call it retail when they're both official now.
---
Point is thousands of people could resub Bc they think it‚Äôs the only way they will get a beta invite and then they get nothing but -15 from their debit card. Everyone will gladly sub as soon as they get that beta invite. You seem to not understand this.
---
When we thought our class set was supposed to prepare us for raiding... good times

That's not true. Many of the changes that drove the game's fall from grace were driven by player feedback. Such as LFD.
---
It is known.
---
Half the reason is because they look better and the other half is because Devouring Plague costs too much mana plus can be self dispelled by 1/4 races and dispelled by 2/8 classes. I'd rather take three 10% chances to stun attackers.
---
This guys has the real questions.
---
It's okay to admit you played Cata, dude. Some of us played clear through WoD, and some of us still play BFA.
---
Google it again, WSG and AV were both 1.5.
---
They plan to add BWL together with them, which was originally 1.6. I don't see a good reason to not add AB at the same time.
---
bugs are a different beast for me
---
Have you tried talking to actual raiders, that play the game? Nobody complains on the wow sub either, show me a single post where somebody does.
---
Seeking out the Forums for serious feedback is your own fault.
---
Beautiful
---
I would like that too. You CAN be a feral DPS or tank, but there are at maximum one per raid. Pushing good numbers requires a tedious amount of work with farming the consumable from Gnomer.
---
CS isn‚Äôt sending invites or determining what criteria beta access is given out for.
---
Min/max elitism is cancer and has completely infested gaming in general.
---
Anyone can make a custom channel, even if not implemented by blizz, it will be there.
---
Enhancement and Elemental were not viable raid builds until BC.
---
Asmongold died seconds earlier, there's a clip from his PoV showing this
---
Most likely due to some people like to play it
---
Wall jumping glitch is not possible in Classic beta. It will behave like it does on Modern WoW.
---
Also pulling and tsa.
---
As somebody who mained a healer from the first week of Wrath until 2016, I definitely appreciate the updated raid frames.
---
Enhance is a meme by this patch you can't even do nightfall because it's doesn't proc on WF. It's pure meme. That being said. If you stack that gear. Memes can end your existence in classic.
---
It's almost like those aren't mutually exclusive.
---
I always say "Good luck out there" when I leave people in vanilla. Feel like most could actually use it.
---
I'm with you. I didn't sign up for the beta and I'm not watching streams, I don't want to be spoiled.
---
We already have 6 "patches" instead of 12. AB is just a 3rd BG, horizontal progression, it adds to the game without making anything obsolete.
---
Im looking forward to leveling being such a huge part of the game, and taking a while.  Ive always been an altoholic because i love leveling up and seeing the world.  As time has gone on, the leveling experience has gotten ridiculously fast and easy, and its just kind of...i dunno.  It gets boring when youre blazing through it without thinking, and youre suddenly max level.
---
Taking a couple months to get my main to max level, and then still having the opportunity to do that on other toons as i feel like it will be very nice, i think.
---
They had some crowd control -&gt; scatter shot + freezing trap, also used to pull mobs to tank (feign death was usefull). Trueshot aura to amplify party dmg, and with proper skill rotations they weren't last in dps.
---
There was also an ability called tranquilizing shot which removed enrage on certain raid bosses. 
---
Didn't play this class in vanilla, so for sure missed some stuff.
---
Anyway even in 5 man party they could replace a mage.
---
I was in Llane from right before battlegrounds were implemented, I basically only saw VC. Same with Dark Iron when I switched to that server
---
Haven't tried it with DXVK yet.
---
Whats the purpose of dps meters?
---
Right. I'd assume the majority of people who took this survey are already waiting for Classic and not subbed.
---
You GG‚Äôd too early - we‚Äôre in overtime and I‚Äôm telling you thrall picked up an AXE, not a hammer like he would have in Classic üòé
---
Asmongold should be treated as your goofy hyper active friend. Once you get that he's just goofin and having a good time he's fun to watch. He's not the faker of classic.
---
Yess!!! Seriously without any config? I remember I had serious issues with the Blizzard Launcher during the Demo?
---
But now all good? Without any configs whatsoever? That's wonderful! What distro u on?
---
K, no dwarf priests. CANCEL THE RAID WE CANT DO IT!
---
warm body. Imagine how hard it is to find 40 people that have consistent attendance. You took mostly anyone who was 60 and prepared for the content.
---
Word? Right.

That was using noggenfogger to jump FROM Hyjal, not how to get into it.
---
I played Vanilla.
---
I did the grinds. I did Hydraxian Warlords. I got my Seal of Ascension. I have a character that can still make Dirge's chops from the recipe you get on the sceptre quest (never got my own sceptre).
---
When I started researching Classic wow and what people were planning, I started hearing about people going for a Week 1 or Week 2 rag clear and it honestly made me sad. You're gonna see people grinding for hours just to get to the MC/Ony gear grind. After that they'll have alts, professions and ganking, and I think that some of the more hardcore people are gonna get bored. I REALLY don't want to see people who come back for new phases and then go away again.
---
I'm gonna be playing like you will be, casually leveling up my warrior.  I AM tempted to power level up a rogue and get engineering for sapper charges and sabotage all the try-hard raiders and ruin their world buffs, so maybe i'll do that if I get salty enough.
---
The client is in charge of this behavior, not the server. So nope, it was not changed in vanilla.
---
More of these. This brings back memories Fk. Memes are important
---
I'm asking about phase 3, when 2 BGs are released but the 3rd one is not - even though it's not OP or anything.

Who is this? is this TIPSOUT? i don't watch his stream so im curious
---
Kargoz told mages not to train slow fall. No beta for him.
---
i got beta, its possible. But mine is a day 1 account. My loyalty when blizzard was good is rewarded.
---
What is the story behind that, anyway?
---
I was a MT clicker in a hardcore progression guild up thru Cata - I got the job done and was extremely competent in Arena.
---
Once I switched to raid heal shaman and learned about macros and other key binds - holy shit I can't believe I submit myself to such torture as a clicker.
---
To be honest, I totally forgot about cosmos. And I have around 1000 hours played vanilla (starting with us closed beta)...
---
I'd like to think the classic community will be more laid back than the  "GO! GO! PULL!!" idiots you deal with in retail. I think most people will understand that you are still learning the ropes.
---
The only way to learn is by doing. Your skills will improve over time. Remember, DPS are a dime a dozen, so if you end up with a d-bag in your group, kick and replace.
---
It's completely fine for you to not want to spoil the game for yourself early but please keep in mind that the beta is not for enjoyment, it's to help polish the game so we all have a better product for release. Betas are really important for games like WoW with many different components. Especially so in this case because we want an authentic experience and many things have changed with the underlying code compared to 1.12. Having a lot of people go through and find issues will benefit us all in the end.
---
Once I get to Stormwind I won't be delivering a little package, I'll be killing your king.
---
I used to login at 6AM before work each day to complete a few quests in relative peace...
---
Yeah.
---
I cant wait until the haters get shut up and Classic puts BFA into the ground.
---
It's going to shock the gaming industry.
---
NO CHANGES !!!!!  I like it
---
esfand also didnt have freedom yet either
---
Failing. I'm looking forward to failing.
---
I'm looking forward to pulling an elite mob and waking up at the spirit rezzer. I'm looking forward to having a suboptimal talent build that I have to pay to fix. I'm looking forward to having crap gear that's out of date. I'm looking forward to getting completely lost.
---
I'm looking forward to playing a game that doesn't hold my hand, and instead thrusts me out into a large, dangerous world and expects me to turn myself into a hero.
---
Yea. Don‚Äôt care at all.
---
That's a lot of mages.....
---
I expected more paladins tho
---
Hopefully, a lot of them will go bug hunting once they reach 30
---
Ehh I would thank the WoW emu team that brought these projects to life in the first place. Nostalrius was just one of hundreds of active places over the years. Just because it was the biggest, doesn‚Äôt mean it started the movement.
---
On the continent?
---
Didn‚Äôt you get it in SW and it ended in Loch Modan? Or am I confusing it with another quest
---
Any hybrid class (pally shaman Druid priest) will be forced into healing because there healing spec sucks the least of the 3. And why bring a garbage Druid when you can bring a sub par rogue who will match or double there dps.
---
You are sperging out because I stated a fact. Like, dude, chill, take a good look at your life, and address your issues.
---
Yeah, stinks of modern wow alright :(
---
You just train it as a spell from your trainer for the level 40 one, so not technically "free", but as close as it gets
---
BRF is still my favorite raid ever.  Loved that Blackhand fight
---
Lol go and watch some actual duels instead of crit montages bro for example ogjeffrey and norths fight club and then tell me again how rogues best every class
---
Rouues only beat noob players easier
---
Really is been like that since WoD? I thought it was Legion that put them on the player instead
---
who?
---
this might be the best general classic advice for anyone worried about lacking knowledge going in
---
That's right, it came in with Warsong.  It didn't seem right that it was alone but for some reason it was stuck in my head as 1.4
---
Same for me, we need to stay patient!
---
not sure how you can judge how bad someone is, when they have no chance without having the abilities that make that matchup doable
---
So bis gear that really shouldnt be in the game for 3 phases dosent add to the game without making things obsolete?
---
CS manager has a direct channel to the devs. So I think I‚Äôm inclined to believe them.
---
Cata birthed the progressive pserver scene‚Äîit was the first time many of us were disillusioned with the game.
---
WoD did the same on a wider scale, seeing nost with 800k accounts.
---
I agree with the point of your post, it's a lot more social overall, but what was said in the chat in this specific screenshot isn't really out of the norm for retail. If you do any kind of mythic dungeons you'll generally see that.
---
Exactly, that was a joke :P
---
Yeah i was meaning over all, as a PVPer as well I'd also say vanilla was best.
---
I never liked arenas, love wpvp and bgs were not xrealm.
---
@mouseover wasn't an argument in vanilla
---
I really don't give a shit about the Tips guy or any streamer in general (why would I watch someone play the game when I can just play it), but I hate when people talk themselves up and have nothing to show for it haha.
---
He‚Äôs a millionaire and you‚Äôre probably older working your wage cuck 9 to 5 job being a nobody in society (or worse, you have no job and you‚Äôre just leeching off your parents like a bum).
---
Still gonna play what I enjoy despite popularity, most people won't even get to 60
---
Noticed on a stream they swapped out a bag without emptying the current one first. And on that note wasn't it also needed to have an empty bag slot for any swapping.
---
Of course
---
It wont kill retail IMO. You have a complete other group of people who strictly love retail and wont play classic and you have a group who will actually enjoy playing both.
---
Remember to either double paladins or half the rest. They are faction locked while mages can be on both factions. So in this poll shamans and paladins are actually leading
---
Nah, both of those have reasons.
---
and that's pretty much how the NE's work in WoW. the only humans you find in NE areas are a handful of paladins who are chasing after the Warlocks who've set up in Darkshore and Ashenvale.
---
However the Horde has been continuing to encroach on NE territory despite repeated requests to back off. The alliance didn't, they actually left and went down to form Theramoore, and the only other attempts at human settlements are either Proudmoore's remnants or foreigners up to no good. And the NE's being part of the alliance is more nominal, similar to the undead's contribution.
---
the undead's issue is more complex since A LOT of powerful nobles in SW are also former lordaron nobles who fled during the scourge invasion and are looking to use this a chance to gain WAY more power than they've ever held before, who've ingratiated themselves and wielding a fair amount of power (especially during the Vanilla era where Onyxia is manipulating them. Hell it was originally going to be full on Deathwing himself, pretending to be his own human persona's son, before they decided that was going too far). And using the excuse that the undead are monsters and should be destroyed and the alliance is a bit split on the issue, which naturally pushed the undead to look for allies. Politically, it makes perfect sense why the forsaken would end up having to begruding ask the horde for back-up.
---
No, you are to understand this as "I like to play games while socializing with others who also likes playing the games".
---
If you've only played bad how can you know what bad is?
---
Honestly they re-make D2:LoD sans bots, duping and hacking you can bet your ass I'll throw money at Blizzard. And besides Classic WoW, Blizzard is completely on my "Will Not Support" list.
---
I'd say about tree fiddy
---
thats was one of the ways to get in you float into hyjal
---
The level 30 wand has worse DPS than gravestone scepter, doesn't have any stat buffs, and doesn't do shadow damage so it doesn't stack with shadow weaving. The only better wands are blue BoE drops, the next easy to get significant upgrade is chillnail splinter in the low-mid 40's from an elite duskwallow marsh quest (if you are horde).
---
I haven't played since patch 1 of cata. I didn't realize blizzard had solved the gold spammer issue since then. Back when I played retail the spammers would whisper you, post in trade chat, send in game mail, and run scripts on level 1 orcs in orgrimmar causing them all to suicide at the same time spelling out websites with their corpses.
---
It was bad.
---
Rogue isn't even in the top 3 most played. 
---
1.Warrior
---
2.Mage
---
3.Priest
---
At least that is how most private servers play out. If you ally you can switch priest with paladin.
---
The discussion was about 1v1 viability so i just talked about that 
---
Ogjeffrey and north had a fuel tournament a few weeks ago you can find it on youtube
---
Ah thought he just ran out of creativity.
---
Or train entangling roots
---
How about less celebrities and more regular people?
---
Feral for leveling bro
---
Depends on the faction. 2H Fury is better for horde up through BWL, Sword spec arms outclasses 2H Fury for alliance around the same content tiers. PVE DPS with a 2 hander it's all about getting extra white hits to avoid the rage starvation problem. Horde has windfury for that while alliance has no such alternative.
---
No and I am not holding my breath. I am excited to dive in at launch and muddle through with the plebs. I played during vanilla and I took my time. I plan to do it the same way this time.
---
Glad this was pointed out, I was considering re-subbing just for the chance
---
My god dude. Beta testing =/= actively looking for bugs. Like sure hes doing way more than tye others, but pretending that tgis is tye norm, and that everyone *should* do it tvis intensely is jyst being an ass. Beta is mostly about people playing the game normally and posting the bugs they stumble upon
---
Yeah for sure, if it turns out to be true I will be rolling a priest or maybe a shaman. If not then probably a hunter or warrior
---
He still managed to get a Sulfuras so I'm not sorry for him lol

---
Did I say that? I just know that streamers advocating this gamestyle will draw lots of players into thinking this is the way to go and these people will miss out on an epic experience in the pursuit of their idol streamer.
---
SOME people will have fun racing to max, but many will be lured in to do the same and miss out on an even greater fun by skipping basically all the content WoW was about at launch.
---
It's not like I want to forbid anyone from doing anything, but relentlessly asking for the slower paced journey that classic wow is for a decade and then getting ready to race through it in 24h seems weird. Sure for people who can play 24/7 and start a relaxation alt right after it doesn't make a difference, but for the person who never played classic, skips all the content and then wonders wtf everyone is on about it it might just be a forever missed chance.
---
There‚Äôs a good amount of non influencer non subscribers who got in from what I heard
---
i just died at the gate and rezed on the other side
---
Repair bills, consumables, and when you first hit 60 there's a couple of BoE items you can get for pre-BiS (which also means they're expensive). 
---
tbh, I was never rich, but I also wasn't scraping by for gold either. People generally understood repair bills, and often when I was running people through 5-mans they'd say 'let the tank have it for gold if no one needs it' on random blue or green drops. Or would offer a bit of gold. Usually for raids and such, guilds help with repair bills, although I always paid more. Still, as I said, I was never broke, just never rich either.
---
Probably the biggest point is consumables for raids. That can get pricey if you're buying everything, or difficult to farm them yourself. A good guild can help here some.
---
Seriously BLizzard please.  I want to play on a RP server but all my friends want to be on a PVP server. I want to have best of both worlds...of warcraft!
---
One thing that people don't seem to realize about vanilla is that the dps charts/rankings can vary wildly depending on gear and the fight in question. What I mean by that is that just because hunters are technically the lowest ranked dps when gear/skill levels are equal, it doesn't mean you're always going to be at the bottom of the raid. 
---
Small incremental gear upgrades and the particular fight (how mobile your group needs to be) plays a large role, along with the amount of effort (time lol) you put into your characters.
---
So yeah, hunter dps is definitely not on top. That absolutely does not mean that you won't see hunters near the top of the damage charts though. There is room to min/max. There are things you can do to gain advantages over other players. 
---
I'll give you an example with an even worse dps class. Feral druids might put out shit dps, but if you want to be a try-hard (read: compete) you can farm Manual crowd pummelers from gnomer, you can powershift, and you can obviously level engineering. I'm not saying you're gonna top the charts, but you can come close on particular fights. The most rewarding part is that you actually have to be incredibly active in your rotations as opposed to spamming frostbolts or shadowbolts.
---
‚ÄúNew Symptom of the Curse‚Äù is my band‚Äôs new album name. It‚Äôs decided.
---
When I've gotten in to betas, I've not wanted to spoil story, but love to class test. Both for legion and BfA, I spent time playing all classes and specs in the proving grounds. I'd often report 8-10 bugs per sitting, most of which I actually saw addressed. Since then, I've taken to actually reporting bugs in game on live, no matter where I find them. Coming across a quest in Northrend (don't recall which one) I remember thinking, "How is this STILL broken?!" Only to have a realisation hit me like a ton of bricks: what if the devs have no idea it's here because they haven't leveled through here, and no one reports it? I've reported a lot since, and though my format wasn't horrible, this format is much more concise. Thank you! And thank you a second time for caring about beta and it's intended purpose.
---
The only reason undead can be priests are because of shadow priests, otherwise we‚Äôd have undead paladins too
---
As a rogue you will be fine. I've played one before they are never overpopulated. The only thing you can have a little trouble in is finding dungeon groups and it's not because no one needs you. It's because classics version of dungeon finder. Is the rogue class. Raid spots will be easy to find if you wanna play a rogue.
---
Okay I guess if you put it like that it makes a bit more sense.
---
That's the spirit!!
---
Dude just look at the mechanics in the MC bosses compared to Nighthold.  The hardest part of vanilla raiding is getting geared, attuned, and actually scheduling 40 people who keep the commitment.  Once you've done that you...focus adds? Then cast frostbolt until youre oom? Their mechanics are easy as shit
---
I agree completely, but then how is that not mutually exclusive with elitism/gatekeeping?  Unless everyone you socialize with is also an elitist gatekeeper, I guess.
---
Are yoy retarded or did you just not read the post?
---
No joke. I always get a good laugh at the "take your time and ENJOY the experience" posts that always pop up.
---
I'm rushing to 60 as fast as humanly possible. I want to enjoy max level PVP and PVE. UBRS runs, attunements, all of it.
---
nice! i enjoy shaman most.
---
I also think its funny when you say if you combine shaman and paladin because shamans would make up 30% of that mash up. Pally's are so popular it's ridiculous.
---
Yeah, especially when new retail expansions come out, classic pop will drop heavily.
---
I think you used to be able to link whatever, then it was changed
---
wait so nightfall is useless? i figure i could be a nightfall WF totem bot.
---
he used loh at 80% health and ran away from the hunter who was chasing him who had literally like 1-5hp, a judgement would have killed the hunter. i also just think he's annoying and this is my own opinion. he failed a  group quest because he wasn't paying attention and tried to get the group to all fail so he could do it with them again. he was practically crying because asmon made a guild and he wasn't a founding member, he was begging asmon to disband the guild and recreate it so he could be a founding member. it's beta who cares? he just seems douchy to me. and he played pservers so he thinks he knows what vanilla was like.
---
feral!
---
Don't report findings from your private server experience
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Seriously, this is your chance to do something different, back then.  I was Alliance from 2004-2009.  Rolling Horde and new class on classic
---
I wanna play resto druid but I've been put off it for a while from other people's comments. Played hunter in retail vanilla and a mage on private server.
---
Sweet thanks for the advice! I just made a prot warrior on an instant 60 server and tanked some stuff, it's pretty fun. I had issues with the DPS really outgraring me and then they would each attack different mobs and I would have trouble holding aggro on both when they did that
---
Its very true. Retail raids have been more demanding mechanically for awhile now. Even first week normal clears are probably more difficult than most vanilla content. Mythic is on another level entirely. Getting 40 players to consistently attend is the hardest part of vanilla raiding.
---
So? You can never catch up. More bubbles and LoH just means you die slower.
---
How do you see the relative theoretical DPS of each class?
---
Mop‚Äîat least for pve‚Äîwas incredible (imo) 
---
Challenge modes, difficult 10 &amp; 25 man heroic content. Good pacing (except tot should have last longer and been released later) for content release, fun world content in the thunder isle and timelost isle.
---
Class combat mechanics were generally deep and complex (WE STILL HAD DOT SNAPSHOTTING) 
---
Our expansion long progression of our farm and cloak were not nearly as pointlessly time consuming as any similar content which has been introduced since (looking at you heart of Azeroth and garrisons)
---
Strafing is 100% broken and is how strafing works on BFA and recent xpacs. 
---
On the Classic Demo as well as the Beta it's currently still looking how it does on the BFA client. The torso does not turn the way you‚Äôre strafing, only the head does like in retail &amp; recent expansions. Back in the day (before Blizzard messed with character models) your torso would shift in the direction you are facing / strafing as well.
---
Me, myself and I
---
This was never possible in retail wow. Are you on a private server?
---
Jealous. When my friend and I hit 10 we thought we were amazing. That's where I plateaued. Did everything I could but beg to get in.
---
So in Vanilla there was bug with sentry totem, it was basically shaman slow fall.  When you dropped sentry totem while falling it stopped you midair and you'd take fall damage.  I would use it in AB when I was at LM and BS was getting attacked.
---
There's no chance of it killing retail while the game is still using old content. If Classic ends up more popular than retail after Naxx it might make ActiBlizzard question where their investment into the franchise should be going.
---
Honestly it would be real nice of blizzard to put in the WF tool tip. Just how hard they hit it with the nerf bat Shaman is the biggest Trap class in classic.
---
Warlock is a lot more popular than I thought it would be.
---
So awesome to see no server names in the chat...ahhh
---
Yes I think so unless my tastebuds lied to me
---
Wait, did the night/day cycle in wow follow real world night/day cycle? I legit never knew that.
---
First off, "Not in a good place" is extremely subjective. If you are going for world first, which if you are asking these types of questions you aren't, then you wouldn't roll a druid. But feral can MT or OT all the way through Naxx. Feral DPS isn't top tier but is totally acceptable for a raid to have a couple. Feral DPS is much more serviceable than balance, especially with LotP.
---
There is an overwhelming elitist attitude on this sub that if your group has anything other than mage/rogue/war it will be impossible for you do anything as far as DPS or tanking. As long as you can show up and play, you can raid semi-seriously (minus a few meme-specs).
---
This. Right. Here. I started mid-vanilla, and played until MoP was announced. Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath were great. Awesome social aspects, actually stopping to strategize in dungeons, etc. Most of my friends had left early cata, and I found myself logging in to do dailies and logging back out. The nail in the coffin for me was when I was tanking a new 5-man, with a healer friend, and the rest of the (LFD) group just wanted to faceroll. I actually wanted to learn the boss mechanics, but nobody was interested. 2 DPS dropped at the first boss wipe because I didn't know the mechanics.
---
It's a game. I did read stuff outside of the game, but for 5-mans I preferred to learn from/with the group.
---
I played for a couple of months over this last winter, and leveled my warrior to 110 just to say I did, but what kept me in WoW is gone. I started a new warrior on my son's trial account, and was really surprised to see that solo Hogger is a joke now, and the leveling is way too easy.
---
They did a server restart idiot
---
From where? Hyjal is the highest place in the game. I was just commenting on the video you linked, which was showing people jumping from Hyjal to Darkshore.
---
There are multiple ways to get into Hyjal, I'm sure there will be some way to get in.
---
Good one.
---
&gt; Which is usually the case when discussing 1v1 matchups, unless it was specified that it's world pvp in the first place. 
---
I think this convention mostly grow out of convenience rather than logic. Duels were mostly done outside of capital cities because it was convenient, and from that a competitive tradition grew out of it. But for anyone thinking about duels logically, it is indisputable that it is not a good measure of overall pvp abilities. And I feel like for the majority of people, the pvp they care about is world pvp or bg pvp where there are actually rewards, and you actually can get killed. Most players care about the pvps that you cannot choose to accept or deny like when you're farming materials in high level zones and face an enemy who can corpse camp you until you log off.
---
If you ask most of the best pvpers, but from vanilla as well as pservers, they would agree with me on this (even though they did plenty of dueling). That's why many of them go all the way to the arena to film scenes where they fight their own faction members. Despite a simple duel outside the capital city being way more convenient.
---
&gt;Like this?
---
Was that warlock in only rank 10 gear?
---
Also, the rogue did not have the full pvp tool set or did not use them all. When theorycrafting we try to control the variables by giving all available tools to each player. This way, we know how classes actually stack up to each other when gear, consumables, cds, skill aren't involved. 
---
For example, did the rogue in this fight use thistle tea? Did he use shadow absortion consumables? Did he use Tidal Charm? Did he use sprint to run away and reset? Etc. There's a lot of tools that were not used, that a better rogue would have used to win the fight.
---
He didn't abuse certain mechanics like sap cheapshot stop attack without breaking stealth to build combo points. He pretty much did rudimentary rotations, popped a spell reflect, and that's it.
---
&gt;Since when do all warlocks run around with zero shards, is this like an unspoken rule? What "harassment cycle"?
---
The warlock can have 5 full bags of shards and as long as the harassment cycle cannot be interrupt, then eventually the warlock will run out.
---
The harassment cycle is the use of resetting fights to burn through a warlock's soul shards and/or other consumables before the rogue burns through his consumables.
---
For example, the rogue can sap/blind/gouge/trinket/gadget cc the warlock and kill his pet. Then reset the fight by running out of casting range and restealth. The warlock either chases you without a pet leaving himself open to blind, cheap shot, and stunlock to death, or he burns through a soul shard to summon a pet.
---
Realistically, a rogue doesn't need to use all those cc methods to kill the pet, so he can use a couple at a time to kill a pet. He will also stalk the warlock preventing him from getting any new soul shards.
---
Eventually, a warlock runs out of soul shards and runs out of pets and the rogue will win through attrition. This is an extreme scenario, I think a rogue who has a full pvp set of utilities and consumables will be able to just kill a warlock. But not by playing the way the rogue played in your video.
---
Unless you're EU. Theres pretty much zero big EU streamers for WoW Classic.
---
There are lots of on use items that you can‚Äôt activate in feral forms.  The test is to see if it activates in feral forms.  If not, does it actually impact cats/bear attack speed if you shift into that form after you activate it in humanoid form.  Interactions for Druids are always the exception, not the rule.  I wouldn‚Äôt assume anything without testing.
---
Why isn't this comment 50 points ahead?
---
iirc the oozeling in vanilla only gave you a debuff when you summoned it, and it counted towards the 16 debuff slot limit so people could use it to knock other debuffs off of you. my guild used it to exploit some fights.
---
Druids were basically unkillable, but ONLY because of their ability kite/abuse bear form mitigation.  
---
The unkillable healer and tank nonsense started sometime in late wrath /cata iirc.  
---
Vanilla Druid is probably the hardest class to kill, but if they try to just heal through your damage without shapeshifting they will go down like the titanic.
---
I believe you can still get under SW using the archway glitch and get under org jumping the wall next to the hunter trainer. i hope they leave old hyjal in, it breaks nothing by removing access. figuring out this stuff and exploring is what classic is all about.
---
I have been a casual player since vanilla. I still do not understand what "casual" actually means. Is it supposed to mean people too lazy to put any mental effort into the game? Game won't go anyway, you have time to play classic wow til you die.
---
Yeah a sham/pally category would have been the smart way to make this poll
---
Not sure what you are talking about. Why waste your time here if you hate it so much?
---
definitely going lock myself, but druid does look nice as well. Just not sure if I'm willing to heal until feral is viable in raid content...
---
&gt;back then there was no quest guides
---
We had thottbot.com or someone was lazy they downloaded "questhelper".
---
Granted questhelper took all the fun out of leveling and I personally didn't use it, but thottbot was a great source of information back then.
---
can you name some? I only knew of the one that involved jumping up in the pillar and climbing up the mountain to jump down into the zone
---
People act like Nostalrius was the first "vanilla" private server..
---
I have a feeling it will be like original launch.  It will launch to a lot of hype and then gradually increase in playerbase.
---
I have anxiety issues also and faced this along time ago the best thing to do is make it till you fake it I use to hate this type of advice but it truly does work you become desensitized to fucking up after you fuck up 1000x times
---
The clogger of bags.
---
I think the secret areas are cool (it's experiencing content not everyone is going to get to experience) but not necessarily the core of vanilla, it's similar in scope to getting the pirate hat in STV or the Winterspring Frostsaber, just a neat side thing to do, if you're primarily coming back for this then forget about and check out Google Street view.
---
For one, kill order is a thing in vanilla/Classic. DPS'ers shouldn't be spreading their DPS around. Another thing they should be doing is giving you a couple of moments to initiate aggro.
---
For yourself, dunno if you've poked at some tanking guides, but I'd always open up with some shouts to get initial aggro on the group. I'd slap two sunders on the primary target, then start getting 2 sunders on the other mobs too. If they pull aggro on the first one and it isn't about to die anyway, a taunt should hold it as long as it needs to be held before the DPS should finish it.

A lot of salt ITT. Speaking from experience I leveled very quickly in the very large recent and popular pservers and while I had fun raiding and experiencing the end game content (and also knowing it would inevitably get shut down) I for one will be taking classic a lot slower and won‚Äôt be able to even start playing until next January as I‚Äôm traveling for months on end this summer and fall.
---
Taking it slower and knowing the game will stick around for a while is going to be nice. I got sucked into the super elite guilds on the servers and while it was fun, it almost became like a job and also a contest to see who does the most DPS in your class groups, super cutthroat and a lot of stupid drama that I know 110% will exist in classic, and I know some people want that kind of life in WoW especially when paying $15/mo. 
---
But this time around and after leveling multiple 60s, there is absolutely no need for a rush. 
---
Enjoy the game the way it was meant to be, a journey, not a destination.
---
what about my money?
---
i'm talking about things said on a stream.  and i guarantee most people commented without even watching any associated video to get the context.  they saw 'streamer' 'classic beta' world first' and immediately started typing about how much they hate those people.
---
when someone is boasting about how much damage they are doing   at level 10, or talking about 'world firsts' in the beta of the re-release of a 15 year old game, you would have to be a goddamn moron to not understand that it isnt been said seriously. hell, Asmon just said druids only value is to give Mark of the Wild. he's obviously fucking around, but im sure some people are frothing over that comment.
---
My buddy and I are rolling Orc War/Shaman (Aka master duo) will be sure to come gank you xD
---
I'm sure it's not sarcasm but just clickbait to make ppl think they're about to witness something great.
---
I want it to do this completely and then we can start over, and redo tbc without flying mounts, and instead make it some crazy PvP rush to gain foothold in the new world. Certain zones beyond the gates should be contested and it should be built in where world PvP can impact meaningful resources for pve. It can impact the structure and buildings that exist in an area. Open looting of non soulbound items in the burning crusade zones. All raids and dungeons back on hard mode. Race specefic gear for each class of each race for PvP defense awards and rep in this dangerous region. Sorry but no paladins or shamans on both sides. If anything create new unique classes to both sides to create a split in faction experience. No elves on horde no panda, none of that. No new races at all no death knights. Guild garrisons open to contesting. Make epics hard and rare to get. All the values of vanilla but heavy PvP to avoid the faction to faction war dwindling like it did.
---
Your best bet is to look up some videos. I don't say this to put you off, I just think deciding will be easier if you can see it! Feral absolutely gets told to heal almost always, and even then, it's not great because we have no out of combat rez. If you DO find a group that takes you as feral, then you might save the day by popping in to bear if the tank dies, or healing in an emergency. Rogues can alao tank in a pinch, etc. I really think it comes down to what's fun for you. There is no rule saying you can't roll both!
---
Lmfao like half the player base of retail who has never played wow before cata...
---
First post Naxx content patch: we demand Verdan world boss! "Verdan, Slayer of the Unrepaired"
---
This. I'll be hoping in as either a shaman or priest and make friends a long the way since everyone loves a pocket healer.
---
Same buddy. Same. Torn between paladin or horde warrior.
---
Yeah, even as of a few years ago on pservers they were always underplayed.  Meta shift?  Of course alliance ratio will also be way lower than horde, so looking at overall is a little deceiving.
---
Is he not playing the beta for the restail game? 
---
Is that not what you‚Äôre comparing it to?
---
well that's just neat
---
Not going to contest the LoH thing, but he did a judgement on him and it was resisted (hence him living at 1-5hp), then the hunter was able to get far enough out of range (cause hunter and no freedom) before judgement came off cooldown. He ran away cause he would've died trying to chase him.       
---
I'm surprised you think he's douchy considering he's probably one of the nicer people in general but to each their own.
---
Nobody asked Blizzard to inroduce War/Titanforging and they still did it. Turning every single loot drop into a Casino.
---
Blizz trying to appeal to a broder Audience. And increase income this way is what drove the decision making. Not some bloody flamers.
---
Some people have always complained about something and always will.
---
Like Ixion and Hera
---
He did a Targa Rally in Newfoundland with Tremblay, and they seem pretty smart out of character.
---
The guild I raid with has a feral Druid as one of the off tanks and 2 ench shaman on melee DPS.  We are currently crushing BWL.  Play what you want!
---
Classic is a waste of time, classic is a waste of time, classic is a waste of time
---
300$ please
---
It depends what you mean by viable. You can definitely get away with it, but it obviously isn't "ideal". 
---
One thing that I really think will be different about classic this time around is that more people will be having more fun with it when it comes to raid comps. There's no real need to go super try-hard until naxx, and even then, I think there will be guilds based around trying to clear as much content as possible, with fun builds. 
---
My buddies and I are actually planning on starting a guild dedicating to allowing people to play what they want. Enh/ele shams, druids of all sorts, shadow priests, etc. We aren't going to be trying to speed run or min/max.
---
Don't know yet.  Blizz says they are still toying with numbers to see what feels right.  2.5k was the vanilla cap, but there will be waaaay more than that come classic launch.  I expect at least 5-8k.
---
If you would do that you wouldn't know the actual ratio of paladins/shamans.
---
You able to link it? Not gonna watch his whole VOD
---
Haha holy crap that's a small world!
---
Yeah I became Finagle the priest later.
---
Tab+sunder
---
Thunderclap for initial ape; and rend if needed
---
Taunt for emergency situations
---
The hardest part about tanking is finding competent dps ; healers are (we‚Äôre) usually pretty good - get good at making friends and being communicative
---
yah and you sit behind your computer screen and eat your own cum to asmongolds streams. Congrats
---
Better than Leroy
---
Addons need to be adjusted for the new Classic client, wait for announcements.
---
ElvUI stated they're coming to Classic, so they will, they just don't have a working version for beta (not yet at least).
---
Only announcements I've seen so far are Recount and WeekAura, be patient and wait for the rest, beta is been out for only 2 days after all and addon devs are working for *free*.
---
I am on openSUSE Leap. I didn't have to do any extra config whatsoever. 
---
When you start the launcher there is a notice from wine about SystemSurvey.exe crashing but you can safely ignore it and use the launcher normally.
---
The curse of the shaman, being an extremely complex multifaceted class, and being relegated totem twisting.
---
Warrior &gt; everything else
---
Not yet, will try it out at some point though!
---
I'm calling BS until we get a link. A lot of the wording seems off.
---
Because he wants to be prioritized over other people.
---
Most people saying ‚Äúperson who did X, Y or Z should have priority access‚Äù are speaking out of self interest.
---
Lock is another great class I've considered, I love the support/utility focused dps thing it has going on. Druid is nice fantasy wise, but I'm only a fan of resto and balance, feral is bleh. 
---
I'd say don't go druid if you don't like playing resto, since you'll have to. Or if you really want to, try to be a good feral, you will most likely still find a guild to run with, even if it's not "viable". As long as you enjoy it. Sadly there's no enjoyment in balance, which just doesn't work apparently.
---
Also just going to be a ton of everything to start.  I always look to do a lesser played roles but I'm coming around to ignoring that aspect.
---
Mage.
---
Didnt know they would be this populated whenade the decision, but I love the idea of portals and making essential food and drink. The utility in sheeping is also awesome since I loved playing an enchanter in vanilla EQ
---
Oh wow I thought this was sarcasm at first but after I read the comments i was unpleasantly surprised.
---
BGs aren‚Äôt available in phase 1 btw
---
Those melee hitboxes are way off
---
Did you update your beta preferences before or after you resubbed?
---
alex jomes played wow?
---
til
---
Results are as I expected, only surprise to me is Warlock higher than Rogue.
---
shaman is a great class, if you're willing to heal for raids. pvp enh and ele are both viable and fun. shaman is a good choice id say
---
This.  How fucking stupid to only allow current subs...
---
thats so lammeeee
---
I'm torn between priest and mage. Really fancy priest but not sure how my latency will be as a healer since I work away
---
He told mages not to train slow fall. Obviously never played a mage for 1 second in his life.
---
Do you want spiders?
---
You probably shouldn't be able to touch your inventory while dead, although I don't specifically remember from 2006 retail vanilla.
---
Are you me? My story exactly!
---
Cba tbh if you want to see it go look for it im just telling you what i saw
---
One can only hope, that is unless the bug was in that lowbie zone people blew past.  I am going in under the assumption everything created is new and needs to be scrutinized, reading quests texts etc.  I wonder how many people right click question marks, hit accept and haul ass.
---
it was also part of a bet, iirc.  he said if the group wiped, he would gift 50 subs to his chat.  if they didnt, 'everyone' had to sub or give twitch prime's.  they didnt wipe, the viewers subbed and gave primes...and asmond gifted 100 subs anyway.
---
True, but that isnt want the poll was set out to provide an answer to.
---
Unlike today's WoW classic wasn't "zomg you need moar dps gogo". Many classes brought utility that was often times more important than just worrying about who is top dps.
---
I've updated it now so it doesn't clip through the black bars. So should be a little better in 16:9 now :)
---
&gt; have them go to the bottom
---
rip
---
BDO would be seamless if the mounts weren't too fast for my 1080 ti to load lmao

Consider that Oceanic and other realm types didn‚Äôt exist back then as well. So you‚Äôd have a half-US half-Aussie server where all the Americans are on during the day, and Aussies would literally log in the morning to perpetual darkness.
---
If you think blizz invited big streamers to report bugs, you've lost it. Blizz invites them for marketing because they know they'll draw huge amounts of attention. The smaller streamers and non-streamers they invite are the ones they invite to report bugs.
---
why are there two posts for this?  Who made this? and Whos stealing?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpcswf/ragnaros\_wallpaper\_engine\_art\_link\_in\_comments/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpcswf/ragnaros_wallpaper_engine_art_link_in_comments/)
---
Same here, Dec 2004. Just resubbed after beta announcement. GOT IN /FLEX
---
I used to love saying bye to people after a dungeon run then blurt out that I was gonna get naked and take a shower. Always a good exit line.
---
All of these videos are audio-only with a blank white screen to me.
---
Just a quibble here, but you do not have to nolife tunnel-vision one single task in WoW Classic to enjoy it. Back in vanilla my friends and I worked 6 10-12 hour shifts with one full day off a week, and we still found time to enjoy Classic and have lives. The ones who progression raided did indeed have to nolife it, but us filthy casuals still found *plenty* to do to keep ourselves entertained.
---
I wish people would stop spreading this "unless you nolife it and spend all your free time progression raiding you won't enjoy classic" myth. Most people in vanilla didn't do end-game progression. Only a tiny fraction of the playerbase ever stepped into Naxx. Vanilla was a very casual-friendly game.
---
Me: Hunter

Friend:mage
---
I'm worried that they will use the new horse animation. It looks so bad :(
---
He should have his beta access revoked.
---
You get mortal strike at 40
---
Everyone say it with me, "Viable is not the same as optimal"
---
The same? Unless you mean due to the lack of a mount, well slower lol.
---
if they would create a lobby based Arena/BG game where you are max lvl immediately I would be all over that
---
It is NA to be fair
---
Horde - PvP
---
Feral Druid, Fury Warrior, Warlock, Mage, and Resto Sham or Shadow Priest
---
We're going to make a dungeon/wpvp guild that organizes pve raids once a month and PvP raids once a month
---
Sorry I would go do that but I avoid listening to people that don‚Äôt know what the fuck they‚Äôre talking about
---
Thank you Nost for giving us a REAL taste of what vanilla was like. Not this wanna-be from Blizzard &lt;3
---
 u/Queuedodge ... name checks out  
---
Not falling for it. You're either at the front of the pack or left behind and ganked/honor farmed.
---
Remember all the pserver bigdick heroes claiming that they'll hit 60 and clear MC week one/two? How pservers were harder because they had more armor than the vanilla mobs? I wonder if any of them are reconsidering their plans after seeing some of the beta footage. They straight up guessed at so many things.
---
As much as like the older stuff that old stealth animations looks like hes sliding around on ice, very unnatural looking.
---
Eeeew Alliance.
---
Ferals can compete with melees on specific fights. Enhances can compete with the tanks.
---
&gt; I haven't played since patch 1 of cata. I didn't realize blizzard had solved the gold spammer issue since then. Back when I played retail the spammers would whisper you, post in trade chat, send in game mail, and run scripts on level 1 orcs in orgrimmar causing them all to suicide at the same time spelling out websites with their corpses.
---
&gt; It was bad.
---
Yeah this is the reason they remade classic from the legion base game because of all the new systems that were updated and such.
---
For example, botting was an issue from like vanilla&gt;WoD, but now their bot detection is REALLY good and people are going to get banned before they even hit level 10 using bots.
---
Flying mounts are like automobiles.  We as humans no longer have to interact with each other during our commute.  Traveling is no longer a meaningful journey as portals appease our instant gratification.  
---
LFR/ LFG destroyed our sense of community much like the big cities we live in.  We no longer know our neighbors, storekeepers, policemen, local politicians, etc.
---
Heirlooms and welfare gear has made things far too easy.  Just like we no longer have to hunt for food our build our own homes.  Everything in life nowadays is far too convenient.  
---
Do you guys not understand what blizzard is trying to show us?  Just as retail has lost its way, so have we as a society.  Blizzard stripped WoW of its sense of community as a metaphor for how we shut our own selves in and play video games all day and jerk off to internet porn.  
---
I finally understand and no longer plan on playing WoW classic.  Instead I will go to the library.  Chat with the librarian.  Rent a book.  Ride my bike to the park to read and fish on a bright sunny day.  Listen to the birds chirp.  Play a game of chess with the local old man.  
---
I'm finally free.

Theres no way in hell they do TBC without flying mounts, they wont make those changes
---
He‚Äôs simply trying to figure out if it would or not in classic.
---
Should probably see a doctor friend.  Not normal to be so unnecessarily hostile towards strangers on the internet.
---
While this would make for some amazing videos, this really needs to be changed. They're already strong enough in vanilla as is.
---
O      R      C
---
Speaking of add-ons for classic I'd love to be developing some right now but there's no where to get started (and of course I'm not in the beta).
---
Although the intent of the post was for purely gossiping, your comment actually answers it... the speculation makes most sense.
---
I understand it fine, and it would be bad business practice if they said you could only get an invite if you subbed, but they have not said that and people are reading into it. They just said you need a sub to play the beta, and that‚Äôs true. They aren‚Äôt being misleading, people reading their post are being hopeful and desperate.
---
Also a sub is not devoid of value there is an entire game it gives you access to NOW. It‚Äôs up to an individual person to decide to pay $15 a month for a perceived chance at something they were never guaranteed on that condition that was never specified. You seem to not understand this
---
This is pretty good advice.  If you want to tank you have to let your balls swing a little bit. 
---
People like to blame the tank first when things go wrong, even if they aren‚Äôt doing their job correctly.
---
You just have to kind of know what you are doing and play the game the way you think is best.
---
when people are making your job difficult you need to be confident and either let them die or exercise your authoritah and boss them around.
---
The rest of the party/raid is there to support YOU, not the other way around. 
---
Remember at least in 5 mans, dps is the most expendable while tanks are the least.
---
They were stream sniping... They knew their positions lol. Not fair at all and not in the spirit of classic. World PvP and streamer hunting is fine, but don't stream snipe them. It's pathetic at least.
---
It‚Äôs for the lulz, relax. It‚Äôs a meme, not a self post.
---
Runblefury*, Baby Blade of the Windseeker
---
can't go wrong with either. both have good racials. go with whichever you think looks cool tbh
---
You only lost combo points if you gained combo points on a different target.  Simply switching targets and using a non-CP ability would not drop your CP off of the first.
---
Their side being too big tend to be overblown. No you can't ride a kodo through the ah doors, but big whoop. Tauren felt great to play in classic
---
Worg Pup was my second favorite pvp strat after equipping linken's boomerang on a paladin for ranged cast interrupt.
---
Us elitists think it‚Äôs totally acceptable for good guilds to bring along 1 feral druid, 1 shadow priest and 1 survival hunter. You don‚Äôt give us enough credit.
---
Gtfo with your enhancement shamans though.
---
you're too emotional.
---
The definition seems pretty fluid. It could mean people who just aren't interested in progression, people too lazy who want the game dumbed down for them, people who simply don't have the time, etc.
---
People also seem to think that those of us who simply aren't interested in progression content somehow won't enjoy Classic even though probably the majority of players in vanilla fit that description.
---
Shamans are limited to Horde only. You need to double their play rate. Shamans and Paladins are basically the most played classes after factoring in that only half the population can play each one.
---
I distinctly remember from vanilla through wrath that this was a thing. All I can find is this from 2011 but could be a troll idk. https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/3129763557?page=1
---
thanks again for assuming I played private servers! you're so kind
---
No. That was changed by 1.12.
---
The past 15 years of wow have been one giant MMO trial for the industry. Hopefully Classic is a huge hit and developers take notice that while QoL things can be convenient in the moment, they may not be best for the long term health of games.
---
I had the oozeling back in vanilla. It did put something on you, but I can't remember if it was a debuff or a buff. From what I remember it just changed the color of your character to a darker tint, kind of like what corrupted ashbringer did. Beyond that, I don't remember if it there were any negative side effects from it.
---
Surprised no one has mentioned anal yet.
---
Idk most people I know who use duckduckgo are far left. Not sure if this guy is a leftist
---
That only happens in the BC prepatch
---
So, here's a philosophical question for everyone. We don't really know precisely what the coding was like, so assume that the game was strictly coded so that the only thing that would drop your combo points in patch 1.12 was to select a different target, not interact with a different target.
---
The obvious problem here is you're circumventing that by using mouseover macros, something that didn't exist in 1.12.
---
But in the vanilla API, you could write an addon to automatically cast an ability at a specific target without changing your target.
---
While I don't know of any addons that existed specifically to do this as a rogue to, say, blind a different target without dropping your current target, if it was *possible* in vanilla, even if no one did it, should it be possible now?
---
Roll and Alc and Get some Swiftness potions rolling!
---
Just because someone is rushing or playing a lot doesn't mean that they didn't enjoy it. I get that it's not for everyone, but for some people playing 2 hours a night every 3 days isn't enjoyable. And for some hardcore playing every day isn't enjoyable.   
---
We all like to do things different and that makes us enjoy the game the way we like to play. And that's okay.
---
It's very lame Shamans got tooled in classic. Freezing us in this patch is a disaster. It's where they applied all our nerfs but, then said we would get a rework patch. They put that patch off until TBC prep. Which means we are frozen into relative lameness. Unless you are an Ele shaman in BiS gear and, I mean raid BiS. You are a garbage care bear class. Who's entire reason to exist is to cast chain heal and drop WF totem for your betters.
---
Right, I‚Äôm trying to gather information in order to give feedback, to help the developers.
---
Shamans is one of the most popular in this poll if you take into account that they‚Äôre only available on one faction.
---
Well it looks better on PC than a wide image would, since we have a scroll wheel on our mice that automatically scrolls up-&gt;down instead of left-&gt;right.
---
My world changed when a fellow mage in AB taught me how to blink drop to negate falling damage going to the mines. Never farmed light feathers again.
---
I have four friends I'm planning to play with and we're going druid, druid, druid, rogue and rogue.
---
Feral is not a DPS spec why is everyone talking about it like it is
---
Right... Grinding mobs requires a lot of "mental effort" but then again I suppose it's subjective and some might find it requiring maximum intellect.
---
Well then I'll probably stay away from tbc cause I stopped playing for a reason.. like most ogs
---
I'm with you on this one. Retail is mechanically more difficult, classic is gear/class knowledge more difficult.
---
That death could have been prevented by using Shield Block, which prevents crushing blows and crits.
---
He didn't even have it on his action bars lol
---
Depend on what people understand by "lasting". Provided there are some fresh servers from time to time, the game will never die.  It will have enough people, just like every other old "classic" game there is. D2 is still played for example and it's 19 years old.
---
I personally plan to do everything there is, just taking my time....
---
Good :D
---
I think classic will be bigger than Blizz is expecting, even in the long term. *How* big and successful in the long term remains to be seen, obviously, but I fully expect it to surprise both Blizzard and the naysayers.
---
I improve warlocks by giving them flash heal.  all the other healing classes have a spammable direct heal spell, and priests have flash heal as well as greater heal, so i'll take the worse heal from priests and give it to warlocks.
---
What do you mean? How would I rank the classes based on theoretical max dps providing skill, gear level, profession, (all other things) being equal?
---
Mages are more populated than rogues and compete with many more specs for gear.
---
That would be absolutely amazing.
---
Yea but, this should be the tanks job to not let the impatient member rush the party.  Tank needs to pull at the proper pace for themself and the healer.  Listening to a fool and making a mistake because of their foolishness is itself a foolish act.
---
&gt; and nothing new is coming to it.
---
"new" content is coming to classic for 2-3 years, depending on how long the inidividual phases are. After that we may see new (or recycled) content being added to Classic. Blizz said they are open to the idea, so its really not that unlikely.
---
Hunter/Warlock, I just don't like the concept of a pet.
---
Rogues. Always felt like I was playing wrong.
---
it was never in classic.
---
the ONLY class specific items that can drop are BoEs, and they drop from trash.
---
BoPs didn't drop for the other faction until 2.0.1, because both sides technically had all classes now, and the loot-table exclusion was removed.
---
If it doesn't I'll just use an addon and play a healer anyway lol
---
I wonder if there will be fewer Alliance Warlocks on PVP servers, especially after they hit STV and deal with world PVP.
---
Loot trading. Layering. No unarmored mounts.
---
I just cant enjoy Druids. I know they have lots of variety and tools but each time i try to play them it feels so lacking and boring. It feels like they went 95% the way on creating the class but then forgot something critical to finish them.
---
There were literal scripts you could make in the vanilla macro system that would auto target a low hp player in your raid and cast a healing spell of appropriate downrank to heal the exact amount needed.  THAT played the game for you; simply showing you what procs, or what ability are off CD =/= playing the game for you, as you still needed to press those buttons yourself.
---
Been playing a Female Tauren exclusively since 2005, can definitely assure you all of the issues you pointed out, you get accustomed to quickly. Imo (biased but still) Tauren are the coolest, most menacing playable races in the game and it feels great to play them, i'd say go for it.
---
Orc
---
All those things you listed about Tauren are positives, not negatives
---
Also Tauren Warstomp is legit
---
id prob give warlocks seed of corruption and take aways hellfire and rain of fire
---
as for swapping vanilla spells maybe give paladins smite so holy could do some smite spamming , maybe give paladins a taunt just so prot was a lot more viable
---
id not actually change anything but the smite and seed of corruption would be fun to play around with in vanilla
---
the fuck... you could always link stuff from atlas loot. Never heard it would dc you cause it hasn't been dropped on the server. thats just straight up bs
---
Cosmos \*leans back in chair\* now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
---
Probably priest and warrior. Both are just really boring to me. Endgame for them are interesting though
---
Sodapoppin was asleep, his viewers had to go somewhere.   
---
I used to love Asmon but every time i tune in during the beta its just "if i do this mundane easy thing everyone needs to give me twitch primes".
---
Exactly.  When people first started playing wow they didn't have an item and quest database and it's much more fun to interact with other players.
---
I‚Äôm a person who loves to rush. I do have to say: being casual doesn‚Äôt make you a bad player. Just for the record. 
---
This us versus them mentality across the subreddit (classic vs retail/ casual vs hardcore) is dumb as fuck.
---
Grinding mobs? The fuck are you talking about? You grind mobs now as well.
---
That is a carefully thought out and rational opinion. I'm going to need to revoke your /r/classicwow membership card, until you've proven to me that you can be as reactionary and hyperbolic as you're expected to be.
---
Yes! I participated in that back in the day. After the "OMG, I am playing with the guys from Penny Arcade" euphoria was over, it became hard to overlook the giant \*\*\*\*storm it became. The guild(s) were unorganized, the pvp rather meaningless and it became rather stale. 
---
But still, Good times.
---
You see how you put a negative twist to your post that no one will be impressed ? That's like someone saying "you aren't gonna raid? No way you'll have fun only doing UBRS and rolling alts for the 10th time.  
---
I don't plan on trying to be 1st at anything, but I don't get why you guys always have to put some negative spin on the way someone wants to play the game.
---
Because we are reading everywhere that Warlock is a good PvP/PvE class. Can do both with 1 build
---
Is strong in PvP, easier leveling, easier mount etc...
---
The way I see it- from a min/max perspective Orcs are superior in many many ways. For PvE they have [Blood Fury] I believe it‚Äôs called? It gives a large attack power bonus. For PVP they have the ungodly passive +25% STUN resistance this means that 1/4 times you will resist rogue stuns, engineering Grenades and hammer of justice among many item stun procs (see [The Unstoppable Force] for instance). 
---
That being said, I am NOT a min/max‚Äôer myself. I plan on rolling a Tauren hunter named ‚ÄúMistamooagi‚Äù so take my advice with a grain of salt. Tauren shamans aren‚Äôt destitute or anything, and the advantages you‚Äôd get running the better race are MINIMAL and thus unimportant to the overall classic experience. Essentially you do you!
---
yea i mained a holy priest in vanilla and leveling was basically just shield yourself, put a dot on the target, and auto wand until it either dies or you need to refresh the dot. having said that, i love healing and was able to get in a lot of groups so it wasn't too often i was soloing anyway. i can't think of a class i didn't like playing actually. maybe warriors or rogues if you didn't have a healot due to downtime?
---
It‚Äôs not just this sub that has that attitude though. Back in vanilla you would never get a raid spot if you were feral. They seem in a much better space today then back then. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt go feral I‚Äôm just saying most people have a biased and it would be more difficult to get a raid spot as one.
---
Hah, thats crazy. I guess back in 04/05 I was on so much I didn't notice.
---
So with classic are they going to make it similar to the original or is this something they changed like the weather?
---
meirl
---
Im not even sure if people i play with on retail will be playing Classic or not, and none of the people i know IRL play wow.
---
I dont even really mind.  Its easy to make friends in game, and if i want to just have some quiet time and play alone i dont have to answer awkward questions or feel pressured to do something i dont want to.
---
Not to mention their tier gear will drop and no one will be able to use it!
---
I'm curious to see the numbers from the first month to those that stick around to month 2.
---
Tbc was arguably peak wow. Most OGs actually played through to WOTLK.
---
No and ill tell you why. 
---
Questing was the content for WoW, the majority of your time would be leveling at first exploring the world. Looking for more quests to do, and sometimes joining groups to do the harder dungeons and mini bosses in the world. 
---
While questing you could do professions, these professions would be more content for you to finish and enjoy, fishing, cooking, gathering the materials to craft things for your own use or to sell. By the time you get to max level you've already got experience crafting and finding people through quests to help others and hopefully made friends that understand your schedule. 
---
By the time you get to max level you're expected to join a guild and make friends to produce dungeon content and possibly trade good items between one another. Any casual can do ubrs lbrs and brd. Even get into molten core and onyxia(back to quest experience.)
---
Modern WoW after tbc lacked all of that rewarding content so casual players got bored. So in short.. classic wow had everything a casual player wanted. An open world with a lot to do.
---
I‚Äôm my guilds asst GM, (best friend and I Co gm we both have played together since vanilla) the guild GM is MT and I‚Äôm OT.  
---
So basically we‚Äôre duo leveling warriors.  We have tanked everything upto AQ40 on Pservers so I know what to expect, I‚Äôm super excited to see what is different.
---
The hype is real.
---
May the Light guide your path, friend. 
---
Ally or horde? What race? What's your aesthetic? 
---
Most people go for human or dwarf priest, and that's fine. I really dig the night elf ones right now, especially male. It'd stand out, it won't be "super optimal" but I'll love it. (But why the animations, dang it.)
---
While your intentions are good, you can't give feedback by compiling a list of retail addons than don't work on the beta, devs already know this.
---
What you can do is testing addons yourself and help debugging their functions, that would help.
---
I got up to Executus in MC in a casual raiding alliance. Topped the overheal charts every run. Healing Touch cast time was JUST longer than a Priest heal. Still hate priests for that...
---
You and other seem to imply that it is a known fact that hunter cannot be a top DPS. I assume it is based on just applying the potential top DPS with the optimal rotation of skills with the best equipment.   I was wondering if those numbers were available somewhere.   
---
The other possibility would be to look at videos of raid during vanilla with a dps meter for top guilds. I don;t know what is still available online these days, on a video from kripp he seems to be high but that is already Nax? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XZPGWqDMYk
---
I love classic. I wanted classic. But I feel as if though classic Is going to be big, it's not going to be as big as we think it will be.
---
The old style of mmos unfortunately I feel, will be a niche audience.
---
I think it'll encourage blizz to continue it, but to say it's going to kill retail wow is just disingenuous. Blizzard will use both to keep sub numbers high and play them off each other.
---
Time is no longer an excuse. Classic wow will be classic wow. You have all the time in the world to do the content, because it's not going to progress to the next expansion.
---
Me too. Just can't. Stealth is cool, but you gotta do it just right to pull it off. I remember just being frustrated on how long it took for things to line up just right.
---
The buildings themselves r los afaik
---
The only real way around that is to get a grinding group and skip the starter quests. As for getting burned out, it's hard to say, depends on how much you can or can't do the same thing over and over.  
---
Another option is to embrace the madness and goof off with people while waiting on spawns or whatever. Or maybe I still don't get what you mean. :P
---
Sure, you CAN. I am definitely not arguing that. It will just be much more difficult to get a spot and do high damage than with a rogue and he likes both.
---
Well toxic people like you are worse. These random retail streamers we're talking about are touching Vanilla for the first time in years and obviously underestimating the content, not everybody has spent the last 4 years or so playing on PServers. So obviously there's going to be stupid wipes. I played on Nos\_t at launch and I remember it was exactly the same for everybody, such wipes were common because people didn't suspect bosses to two shot you / random patrols / silence or stuns on healers.
---
You're going to "shit on noobs" like Soda in BGs ? How full can you be of yourself ? He's a multiglad from back in Cata times, which is literally the only thing I even remember about him, truth is he'll probably hand you your own ass.
---
The duel tournament either didn't allow consumables and many gadgets/trinkets or the players did not bring those utilities to the tournaments. I can't see any FAPs, invulnerability potions, invisibility potions, etc being used by either side.
---
So in addition to the serious limitations of duels in terms of the amount of space you can use and the kind of terrain you can use, this tournament also doesn't display any classes at their potential because of the lack of all the utility tools.
---
I don't know how we can take this and conclude anything about class performance in 1v1.
---
Also, let's please, stop using duels. Duels were born out of convenience because it was easy to go outside of capital cities to do some simple duels. There's no reward or even death punishment from this. It's clearly not reflective of meaningful pvp that's rewarded or punished by the game, and entire classes like hunters have their core game mechanic of kiting removed.
---
Really don't need to watch a video if people take away that shields were only good for armor and block chance wasn't useful lol.. I raided in vanilla with team ice as a druid and forgotten empire as a main tank up to 7 deep in naxx
---
&gt; I get that we'll have a blizz-like cap of approx. 2,5k people per layer in Phase 1
---
#According to Mark Kern, they raised the pop cap across the lifespan of Vanilla to a max of around 4k by the end of it
---
lol, i actually *just* remembered that a big part of the reason i was going Priest was that i want to play a Dwarf and edited my comment :P
---
Buncha autists. But not the same kind that make /r/2007scape great.
---
By all rights, this sub should be swimming in hilarious memes and detailed discussions... But here we are lol
---
Question: DKP or no?
---
Shamans because shamans.
---
Fucking FEATHERS TO LEVITATE
---
He meant it isn't fun *for him.* He was agreeing with you, put the caps lock down before somebody gets hurt.
---
Cant do 5 at launch
---
No kidding, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for their developer branches, github pages, etc. 
---
Just pasting shit from the retail client is useless, I‚Äôm looking for the VCS links.
---
So I had a wow account before a Bnet one, and its merged forever ago. when I go to my transactions history it only shows my current bnet history, not my wow history. how can i check what my original wow account history?
---
We're going Alliance and our current setup is as follows:
---
Me: Human Warlock
---
Friend 1: Human Warrior
---
Friend 2: Night Elf Druid
---
Friend 3 (potentially): Dwarf Rogue
---
Bad until AQ/naxx tho
---
&gt; Wait for all the people who will rush to get their little bit of fame for first Thunderfury or Scarab Lord title or whatever else... it doesn‚Äôt matter in classic tbh
---
One could argue it matters more now, as people know what they are doing and way more players will be out there *actually* competing for it.   
---
I dont really know where I stand on the topic, I guess a lot depends on how big Classic actually becomes. If it becomes really, *really* big, like comparable or more players than WoW during wotlk it would be hard to dismiss that notion.
---
2.5k was not the Vanilla cap during patch 1.12
---
RPVP is a pain in the arse to police. Don't blame them for not wanting to invest in the resources to handle every complaint about Schlongbonger not being an RP name.
---
This is why I loved the druid spell Symbiosis from MoP.  Swapping spells with another class was so interesting.
---
Can you port me to Org? Thx.
---
Nah I wanna rush to max level as fast as possible. That's what's fun for me
---
Paladin. I can't understand how someone would enjoy this crap of a class. It's like half a warrior that bubbles + hearthstone away when in trouble. The ‚ÄúNot man enough to fight and possibly die‚Äú - class.
---
The plate healer. I just don't get it.
---
You don't have to be good at a game to find bugs
---
Which classes did you play? The only ones I found to be better were Fury warrior, fire and frost (F for shimmerlancing), all three shaman specs, shadow (even after the S2M nerf), balance and feral (post 7.3) and sub rogue. I never was a fan of arcane and arms has been bad in my opinion since it got obliterated with the WoD pre-patch.
---
LMFAO stay mad im just spitting facts pussy
---
If you are a good pvper and make a name for yourself you will find the GM/HWL premades don‚Äôt worry.
---
Huge fan of orcs for the stun resist.. 5% hps wont matter but the stomp is very helpful...and herb gathering.
---
It was always there. That's LITERALLY the same people, because you need an active subscription in order to even have a chance to get into the beta.
---
But. People always take the path of least resistance. That's million years of human evolution thing, you can't take it back. 
---
This game is a perfect example why you should blame developers and not the gamers. Shit like LFR should have never existed. But, there's no turning back now. Retail is past redemption.
---
Really unfortunate, I figured I'd resub around one of the stress tests to get a chance to get in then get caught up for 8.2 for retail. Now o really have no reason to sub untill August.
---
Gotta love people slapping you on the ignore list because they can't hear the truth and/or accept it
---
Atleast 5
---
Give Hunters vanish.
---
Gonna be a whole lot of /train going on
---
CHOO CHOOO CHUGACHUGACHUGA!
---
It is. The poll is asking what class people will play. You need to differentiate between paladins and shamans. They are not the same class.
---
It's always that way, then people play them for a few minutes and change class
---
because the dungeon set could be used by anyone.
---
Lightforged isn't terrible for a warrior. Most of the pieces have pretty decent stats (in a lot of cases it's better for a warrior since a warrior gets more use out of spirit than a paladin does, and only 3 pieces have int on it). 
---
You can even use the set-bonus that gives +damage/healing since certain gear scales from +damage/healing, if you have an appropriate weapon or armor that does.
---
If you are wondering if the walk/run speed seems different, that's probably because of the different resolutions of back then and today.
---
remake vanilla in new engine release 2026
---
It‚Äôs not pure random just because you got in. They even confirmed it themselves.
---
I get that most of you started toward the end of vanilla or tbc, but for those of us who did at release and fell off...our wishes and desires are why they're bringing vanilla back.. most of us hate shit like flying mounts and want fuck all to do with tbc.
---
Thank you for taking the time to do this. I have searched for people talking about this topic because it seemed really high or the tick rate was faster than normal.
---
Dwarves priests are pretty cool, they have a good aesthetic and gorgeous casting animations. And also are bis because of the fear ward you don't even need that much imo.
---
Why do so many people blame flying mounts for the cause of all the disarray in modern wow? Like flying was never the problem with the new design philosophies. The problem was making things at large easier for a wider audience while making it trivial for the hardcore audience.
---
Modern wow has no challenge outside of mythic raiding, even then You spend a maximum of 3 hours doing a day for 2-3 days, and the worst part about raiding is that it isn't a measure of how good YOU are as a player at YOUR class, its a measure of how well your TEAM performed against a boss.
---
Don't get me wrong, raiding is the best thing about WoW currently but the introducing of stepping stones for "noobs" ie.) Looking for Raid and having a total of 4 difficulties for any given raid is just outright dumb.
---
The problem was making talent choices easier by going from a with 3 different sub class decisions to picking 1 spec and allocating 5-7 points that gave you an active ability or a passive ability.
---
The spec trees we had from vanilla to wrath were the best, imagine if wow kept these and just reiterated on making them larger and larger, think Path of exile style(each class would have an array of things to specialize in and your skill point allocation choices would change the way you fundamentally play your character.) 
---
The problem was realm sharding, realm merging, and battlegroup merging.
---
In hindsight these looked like great things for the em-betterment of wows future, think about it... we've got these great communities within each realm "what if we merge all the realms and allow all these communities to interact with each other?". What actually happened was we got overwhelmed, we got sharded out of zones where we knew we could meet up with other players of the same alliance and enemy faction, we got thousands of guilds that were nameless in a sense that they had no value  to them being in the game (Guild tax also to blame for this type of shit, people would just make guilds to tax their players to fund their accounts. Still do.)
---
Lets just use an example of when I used to twink on my server crushridge, I didn't need to add players as friends or be in their guilds to know who was online. I would walk outside of orgrimmar and fucking look around me. If they weren't there, chances are the dudes who I would fuck around with were either in a BG or offline.
---
If I was casually playing the game, and saw a dude with some badass gear you KNEW they were at the top of the food chain in the server, there was no raid finder where you could find cool looking gear at discount rates.
---
&gt;people are just never satisfied and the players are just as responsible for what Retail has become.
---
The problem is when a large portion of the blame is on the players instead of the developers. 
---
Blizzard has the key, they have the iron fist to theoretically slam on a table and say "No". They can use their discretion to make changes to the game, they've done it in the past and it has both resulted in good and bad results. You cannot blame players for wanting things to be easier, noobs will always exist and will always taint player experiences for wanting an easier ride through the game. Its the developers fault for caving the fuck in and giving into these demands.
---
We know what made classic, bc, wotlk great. WE FUCKING KNOW, Blizzard just failed to recognize and understand it before it was too late and their game was filled with 95% casual noobs who just sit on forums all day posting art pictures.
---
A vast majority of players who still play BFA are people who just casually login to do world quests and enjoy scenic views in the game, these are the same people who will fight you to the death and argue that WoW is in a good place and that complaining about the games current status is "toxic".
---
Do it with the rest of the quests. I suggest a guide
---
Egh, need 40 for ms...
---
I've been playing wow since 2007, never touched retail wow. I started in tru-wow (x1 tbc) and then moved to Last-Wow (x12 tbc), then i found out instant pvp servers and played AT wotlk and tbc.  Then it was time for classic, oh yhe, i tried feenix wow warsong out but i didn't enjoy the high exp on classic so i wanted until Emerald dream and after that came nostalrius if i'm not mistaken and we all know what happened next. I got over 300 days /played on private servers, i loooove the community on private servers, mainly because there's no cencorship and you can say w/e you want which makes for a cool edgy environment which i like, I've talked to friends of mine who play retail and they say if classic is anything like retail they won't tolerate edgy jokes, even if it's /say, kind of a bummer for me but i guess it's the price to pay for ensurance that our chars won't get deleted anytime soon.
---
someone posted a link to some page buried on blizzards site and that's how i found this. my transaction history is just blank. idk what the link was tho but a lot of people have been posting it
---
People won‚Äôt leave groups because the tank sucks. it‚Äôs hard to find tanks that want to tank.  Just go in, don‚Äôt give a fuck and have fun.
---
I dunno what this is all about... I was watching tips out‚Äôs stream and he was specifically saying the dungeons seemed too easy and that he hoped it was a mistake. He did claim the leveling and world experience was more challenging than on private servers, I watched him do BFD pretty easy and explain how it‚Äôs normally harder on private servers.
---
Im brand new to WoW and joining classic, been thinking of trying a private server to get my feet wet, are there any running now? do they cost anything?
---
*shivers*
---
It's a pretty common scripting language in gamedev overall.
---
Ummm yeah it (weakauras) can‚Äôt find the target with lowest health and choose a specific rank based on that. Where are you getting that idea?
---
I recently recovered my OG account that i may or may not have traded to a chinese guy for an amount of money back in the day. Looking back at all the 1day credits from when the servers were unstable was so nostalgic.   
---
ps. if anybody did the same thing as me and wants their character back, i told support i was hacked way back when and gave them as much random info from the account i could remember that no one else would know to verify. (character names, address used, date abouts it was created, email, details about characters you remember, names on cards used).
---
Do we know if that was nerfed in the beta atm?
---
Hunters have the most complex dps rotation in Classic.
---
Many people just dont understand how to dps as a hunter.
---
They don't scale as well and fall off in Naxx but from MC to AQ40 they should be top 10 on the meters.
---
They offer a lot of utility as well.
---
It helped being unemployed at the time.  I was hitting top 10 standing solo queuing.  And it was mid 2006 so alot of people already finished the grind.      This time around rank 10 will be the goal.   As raiding will be what I stick to
---
Sorry but I will ;)
---
Well also with a streamer, in the case of asmongold, blizzard has another 100,000 pairs of eyes watching for bugs. It makes a lot of sense to invite streamers with a following
---
same thing
---
staysafe tested it, did not work
---
Druid. Can't get into playing "animals". :/
---
I know plenty of old friends play runescape and aren't ashamed and I did for a while, but regardless of MMO if I'm trying to meet people irl or impress women I'm not going to lead with yeah I play WoW or Runescape lol
---
I would guess all of the ‚Äútourists‚Äù will quit before lvl 20 and a lot of people will get burned out by 45. Any one that‚Äôs lvl 60 is in it for the long haul. Don‚Äôt worry and just play.
---
Exhibit #1 on why Hit% chance is important
---
At the end if the day play what you enjoy being / looking at.
---
Its true on retail but even more true here because there are no race changes.
---
You will play this toon for the next few months to 60 and for the next year-ish if you raid some. If you dont enjoy looking at it you wont enjoy playing ut.
---
So... Funny story... I was indeed the original "troll priest" person from that thread. I posted something, and the first response was the infamous "Why are you a Troll priest?", which got repeated over and over :)
---
This is just as relevant in retail WoW, just sayin...
---
Eh, that would be overkill. I think one of the reasons why they've moved to the new codebase is so that they can more easily improve the engine functioning over time anyway. Unless they are planning to do a complete engine overhaul, which would be an insane undertaking for any company.
---
Not cancel the raid, but you will likely struggle on nef during progression without it. I posted above in detail about the impact fear ward can have. 
---
You saying that you need a new tank if your tank is getting feared just clearly shows you dont know what you are talking about and shouldn't be posting advice.
---
Well, some developers said that. Ion said that they will not release new content. So it is a gamble at this point. Would be interesting tho.
---
Yeah I was being facetious, they are obviously great actors and competent people , their level of humor definitely shows intelligence.
---
Honestly this is going to be a bit of a hot take but if the Classic community is as toxic as the people on this subreddit are, I don't think it has lasting power. I'm excited for Classic but every time I come to this sub there's an argument between two people about how hardcore they are and what their perfect experience is and why the other person is wrong.
---
I don't think that level of passion is a negative, however the fact that people are so adamant about DIFFERING expectation leads me to believe that the community will splinter because not everyone will be happy with their "dream" version of WoW. But we'll see
---
Next thing you know we're gonna have people marrying their pets!  
---
Oh wait, wrong thread.
---
&gt; If classic wow is truly so universally wanted and popular and will manage to be so long term, why aren't we playing more games like it?
---
Because, by and large, they don't exist anymore. Near as I can tell, anyway, and I've been pretty keen on looking for 'em over the past several years.
---
Every MMO I've tried since quitting WoW at the end of TBC plays just like BfA does; fast-paced action combat, no well-defined roles and classes that all blend together due to extensive mechanical overlap, convenience prioritized over immersion, rush-to-endgame design and a disproportionate focus on raiding...
---
To be fair, Vanilla could be argued to have had that last one as well, but it came at the end of leveling and the world itself being the core of the experience before that, which is something lacking in both retail and its contemporaries.
---
The closest I've found to a vague approximation of the experience offered by Vanilla WoW is Minecraft servers. Which is like scratching my earlobe to relieve an itch on my elbow.
---
Well, at least you got to see Antorus in its prime, which is overall a pretty decent raid. My favourite was Nighthold, which just looked amazing and was fairly disconncted visually from the grim colors. The bosses were also well designed, with a very good difficult curve going from 1-3 (easy), 4-6 (spellblade, krosus, botanist; medium), 7-8 (starboi and elisande; hard) and Gul'dan being his own tier. When we got there in mid March it was still such a well rounded fight, also really well tuned.
---
To be fair, you would have to split all non-shaman and paladin class numbers in half to account for factions.  So in reality, every class is about equally represented.
---
i didn't play past TBC but i remember in the forums people spammed suggestions like that every day. same with flying mounts people BEGGED for those.
---
i logged onto my lvl 72 last night and then my lvl 50... my lvl 50 can now use all the difficult expensive mounts that i grinded months for on my main. lol what a joke. who thought that shit was a good idea.
---
wiping caverns
---
Rogue for me as well.  But oddly enough, I like feral druids - I think it‚Äôs having heals that makes the difference.
---
I have played Pservers for 5 years and played in vanilla when I was 17. I have leveled many characters to 60 on 1x server. I have no plans to play beta if I get access because I don‚Äôt want my progress wiped. I‚Äôll just keep playing my Nintendo switch and MTG: Arena till classic drops.
---
Paladin, hunter, mage
---
Hate them, not my style!
---
If he does shadow damage I am 100% rolling a hunter as my first character. Although I also want Broken Tooth. My ideal stable preZG would include:
---
Lupos
---
Broken Tooth
---
A max level Boar if any kind 
---
During ZG replace one of those with a Son of Hakkar wind serpent.
---
You know I haven't tried it yet but I imagine it wouldn't be too bad while leveling.
---
I heard yesterday on someone streams(i forget who) that the debuff limit at launch was going to be 16. Can anyone confirm this as it was 8 at launch and not 16 until the ZG patch and will make raids before ZG much easier.
---
Making content accessible to everyone ruined the game. And WoTLK was too casual, fight me.
---
What if...?
---
This was another shitpost?
---
I used quote marks. I clearly want walljumping back in!
---
tauren female must be the solution
---
Classic WoW is an amazing casual game. Retail WoW is a wonderful hardcore game but a really really really really BAD casual game. 
---
The sense of progression is really great in classic from new character to level 60. There's also a bit of challenge in overworld/leveling content and in dungeons. The classes are also a bit more varied and customizable both to the bad side and the good side. 
---
The leveling experience in classic is simultaneously more accessible and more challenging/interesting/rich and it's not like most other things on the market nowadays. 
---
PvP is also much more accessible in classic vs. retail.
---
Competition. It‚Äôs fun. Can see raid dps and see where you‚Äôre having issues aka dickbag mcgee jerking off and auto attacking instead of actually helping. 
---
Not as particularly useful in vanilla due to threat limitations but still fun
---
This is one of my favorite clips of all time.
---
My wording probably gave the wrong impression. Oh well, it happens.
---
spamming rank 1 wingclip with Nightfall
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169
---
Nothing, they're different games with different philosophies, let it be that way so that way our classic doesn't become retail, in vis versa. 
---
It might be hard to believe but some people like retail.
---
Because it destroys the economy.
---
People aren‚Äôt subbing to play a completely different game. Also, they did come out and say you need an active sub to be considered. There‚Äôs no value in paying for something that you don‚Äôt want and they know that anyone who‚Äôs currently not subbed obviously does not want to sub to play bfa. 
---
Meanwhile we have people saying they got invited without being subbed but needed to be subbed to log in. You are making a simple concept complicated. 
---
Old players want to try out beta, old players willing to pay $15 to play beta, old players don‚Äôt want to pay 15 and not get invited. Blizzard says u need active sub to be Invited. People come out and say that‚Äôs not true.  Why would any returning player from 2006 have an active sub if they played no expansions? We aren‚Äôt going Fromm bfa to a new expansion. We are going back 15 years. 
---
It raises the question who‚Äôs lying? The people on this forum or blizzard? Blizzard can rake in a ton of money for essentially nothing by misleading players saying they need an active sub to be invited when in fact they don‚Äôt and can pay that sub once they get invited so they don‚Äôt risk $15 for nothing. It‚Äôs not a lot of money at all, but it‚Äôs principal and is not a good look if this is the case. Activision stock is down almost 50% from its high. I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt want a bit of cash injection.
---
Easy, for pvp orc for pve tauren
---
Tauren looks amazing in armor, huge shields and weapons
---
The point really flew way over your head didnt it?
---
But then again those are the quirks that made Vanilla so interesting. Would be really cool if they included this stuff
---
are we talking about the same game? because the last time i played retail, almost every character had a skill to avoid fall damage, and tons of toys like gliders, feathers and so on to avoid fall damage too
---
Hunter/Warlock/Druid.  Never have managed to get any of those past 30.
---
Nah, was a 54 hunter with a lvl 5 wolf from elwynn, get on my level.
---
Classic and BFA are functionally different games. There's not a whole lot to take from one game and add to the other, as they have largely different demographics. Some of us might enjoy both games, but a large portion clearly do not enjoy one or the other. Taking elements one hates from one game and adding them to the game one loves will make that game less appealing to a large portion of that demographic. This is not a good idea. I'm not a game dev, economist, etc, but this just doesn't strike me as the right course of action for them.
---
People on retail get pretty upset over flight being tied to achievements, difficulty increases, etc. This isn't bad, but it is a clear indication that there is little overlap between the classic and live playerbase. Significantly altering their game isn't necessarily going to increase subs if people who hate those changes quit, nor would the amount of wiggle room Blizz has to keep most of their current players be sufficient to appease those of us who have long since written off the modern game.

Lua is a nice language to be embedded into other software, e.g. the same way as WoW embeds it to allow end users to script stuff using an approachable, high end api. 
---
Also the compiler/interpreter infrastructure for Lua is quite advanced, c.f. LuaJIT, making it a rather well performing language. 
---
As a language itself I find Lua highly adaptable for its simplicity.
---
A single warrior cant dodge all fears on nef or onyxia. Fear ward dramarically increases the threat from your MT and your raid wide dps. It is not merely a crutch for bad tanks. You are spreading misinformation.
---
I think classic wow actually lacks great content creators.
---
I mean, I love Josh from Countdown to Classic, I think he does a great job of recognizing his lack of knowledge and then bringing on the right people to speak on it. He‚Äôs simply a good host and creator of a podcast, and deserves some credit. Madseason and a few of the older creators were and are good. But we need, or at least want, more. We‚Äôve been classic starved for years and the announcement of Vanilla created an opening for new creators to jump in. Tips did that, when others weren‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt. He captured an audience with his excitement. 
---
Is he good at the game or even Vanilla experienced? Guess not. But all these people in this subreddit should shut the fuck up and make some content themselves or just stop watching him. I really don‚Äôt understand the anger. If you‚Äôre all so smart, go fucking do it. Hell, I‚Äôve considered it, but I don‚Äôt know shit about recording and editing and I don‚Äôt have time. I don‚Äôt watch his videos because there‚Äôs mostly better info out there. I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just so negative around here for people actually trying to make us some content to consume. You don‚Äôt have to watch it. He‚Äôs not the only person ‚Äúrepresenting‚Äù us. I‚Äôd like to see some discussion on this subreddit beyond ‚Äúreeee streamer.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs true I will eventually make that task to level both toons I think imma just send it and roll with what I know how to play super effectively which is rogue
---
Yeah that's the aura I'm referring to!
---
I agree with this one. All the other classes intrigue me on some level. Just cannot get into Pally.
---
Thank you for saying it, the more time I spend here the more I question investing time in classic if this is the community lol
---
There's a reason Classic is being released at the end of August, blizzard doesn't want classic to eclipse 8.2's release. They know it will and everyones talking about classic already. Classic got more buzz than BFA ever did.
---
Salt?
---
It's called illustrating a point..
---
they could remake the vanilla tho and quadruple the size of each zone
---
He was fixed in 1.12. The beta is 1.12. 
---
Add this to the pile of lupos posts.
---
You're probably right, but how many people are going to stick around for the grind and lack of QoL features like dungeon finder. I predict a huge dropoff (50% or more) within the first 6 months, with a slow petering out until they decide to do TBC or classic+ content. Similar to osrs
---
sorry, but a geared warrior + healer is the single best 2vX combo in the game.
---
I just don‚Äôt want to feel overwhelmed when it comes out. Also I‚Äôd rather feel comfortable on my class that way I won‚Äôt have a problem joining a guild.
---
If it would be harder i would still play it. 
---
Not that i would prefer it but hey, can't be worse than bfa right?
---
1 word: reckoning.  
---
Any1 who says Paladins don‚Äôt have any way to burst don‚Äôt know wtf they are talking about.
---
What if...
---
Doesn't sound like the worst requirements ITT to be fair
---
Get this garbage out of here
---
I don't really blame the streamers, it's really the viewers just trying to get attention and screen time.
---
You do you I‚Äôll do me, how about that?
---
Knowing that Fear Ward is an awesome racial definitely helps, but its certainly not the only reason for me, or even the primary one.
---
As ive gotten older ive just come to really like Dwarves in most fantasy settings, and other than the fact that im fairly tall irl, i have a fair bit in common with them (yay beer! :P).  
---
My first character was a Gnome, and even in Wrath IF was easier to get around than SW, so ive always had a connection to IF.  I love the city, and being a Dwarf really does feel 'right'.
---
buying tons of gold is immoral and devalues achievements
---
getting tons of gold from your friends for free is smart and good
---
its not hard
---
An even smarter way would be to split Horde/Alliance up per class
---
Certain classes, like Druid, would not be as represented in Horde unlike alliance
---
Your logic is stupid. Because less than 1% get free items from their fans, everyone should have access to wow tokens?  Streamers are not relevant to the entire wow economy
---
thats kinda awesome actually.
---
again, I have no interest in classic but if it went to WOTLK I would play it (even though mists is my favorite expansion)
---
how you made the jump from streamers being given stuff by their viewers to tokens is beyond me, a streamer being given stuff doesnt negatively effect the entire game, they are totally different issues.
---
I wonder how many Paladins/Warriors will actually make it through the leveling process.
---
Not to gatekeep but half of the people talking big classic game were burning crusade babies and are actually OK with flying mounts at some point.
---
Its almost like Blizzard has the ability to use discretion when making choices about THEIR game?
---
Sure you can use and listen to player feedback, but Blizzard had the data, they made the moves and failed. They are the ones to blame for what went wrong, shifting the blame onto players is dumb and just apologetic for no reason.
---
I think this advice is intended for people who didn‚Äôt play vanilla or private servers. In other words, leveling isn‚Äôt like it is in modern wow, try to have fun with it if it‚Äôs your first time.
---
I want to play shaman almost for sure. Not sure on race. I was really looking for something that I could heal raids and pvp with so this is a huge factor that might make me change my class (been told 30/0/21 can do this on Shaman tho..).
---
I'm pretty sure the majority of people interested in classic aren't interested in retail and would just unsub. That is obviously not what Blizzard wants.
---
i mained a priest, falling to your death due to lack of reagents is something i wont forget
---
Idiocracy.
---
To be honest I‚Äôd love it if we could all have access right away, but in the absence of that these are the content creators/reviewers whose opinion and insights I would prefer to watch whilst we wait for release
---
So you support permanent bans for people buying gold illegally? That is my proposition if they are not going to offer that.
---
I hope your account gets banned, just for suggesting that.
---
Wouldn't be vanilla then though would it? Quadrupling the size of each zone means adding more mobs, more towns, more quests, higher population caps, the list goes on. I would love to see the next evolution of WoW as an MMO but to expect to be able to apply vanilla WoW as is to that new version is unrealistic.
---
Huh, that‚Äôs really cool, I appreciate that
---
Mage!
---
I literally leveled him to 60 constantly expecting to have more fun then at 60 said fuckit and rerolled a boomkin (yes, I levelled as balance... so I guess it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúboomkin‚Äù until level 40, but still) and had an absolute blast! Switched to resto at 60 and had a great time. 
---
But seriously, mages just we‚Äôre not for me back in the day, even though I always saw myself as a mage in fantasy stuff as a kid.
---
In classic it's hunter, in retail it's demon hunter and death knight
---
FF lets you drop down all the way to blacksmith from up top though, so it's still nice.
---
&gt;Safe to say we wouldn‚Äôt have been where we are today without Nostalrius.  
---
Why is this safe to say? Everything Blizz reveals about Classic just illustrates how wrongly private servers have been doing things for years.
---
Back in vanilla you could jump from any height as a warrior in defence stance. The -10% damage reduction would always let you survive when you had full life before the jump.
---
This one is equally relevant to BFA, it's how my shaman gets around Zuldazar.
---
Says the guy losing his shit over a memepost, lol
---
Yeah, I'm just saying specifically refer to it as a feature. If enough people do it maybe they'll reconsider lol
---
so because a handful of people are going to get a little bit of help from a few people, you want to completely destroy the games economy? how fucking stupid can you be
---
Meh it depends... See for example other streamers like Day9, Kibbler...even krip got his shit together
---
Ah.  When you said mortal strike on a mob I was thinking of using it on a mob.  Not a mob using it.
---
my mom doesn't have beta access how is she suppose to make sure its mom approved without having beta access
---
&gt;I think classic is going to pass retail in player base.
---
I'll eat my shoes. There's no chance of this.
---
Also, they won't tell us the player counts either way.
---
my first 60 was as NE hunter in EPL and i got it from killing a ghoul
---
I honestly can't remember were I exactly hit 60.  I want to say EPL, at one of the scarlet camps.
---
&gt;Min/max elitism is cancer
---
So has a huge entitlement complex for the causual crowd
---
You got downvoted but thanks for making it dark mode
---
No, itll be what I'm expecting
---
Cool if it is but if you think its gonna overtake retail to the point that nobody plays it and everyone migrates over, you're setting yourself for disappointment 
---
Now bring on the downvotes cause I said something slightly negative about classic :(
---
And being broke and losing your house and possessions and stressing over finding a new job to maintain your lifestyle is super fun too
---
I loved Mists, I was playing that as much as I was playing in WotLK, whereas I was less active in Cata. I especially loved the Timeless Isle. I didn't last a week in Legion and I haven't played WoW since.
---
So it could only scale up to your full hp or?
---
It doesn‚Äôt look like it does.
---
I had a constant subscription from release through the first year of cata. then I just bought 1 60 day game card for the next 5 years.  never touched Legion
---
Thanks for complying with the last line of my post.
---
The beta is 1.13, or at least classic will be.
---
Im not saying they don't exist, but I feel like this sub blows the amount out of proportion. Also this sub shits on retail 24/7, but gets up in arms when retail players talk bad about classic.
---
with mobs surrounding them on every side
---
Apparently it‚Äôs tipsout.  I just learned if Him the other day because asmongold was watching his his videos on stream.  Seemed ok. But if this shits true.  He needs to GTFO of beta
---
That's actually a nice idea - I might steal it.
---
I'd have to kill Moonkins in the southern part of Winterspring then :)
---
Even without factoring in "not having enough time", there's just so much more to vanilla wow than progression raiding and the higher ranks of the PvP ladder. I just don't understand why so many people seem to think casual players won't enjoy Classic as if the game only begins at 60 and only happens in instances.
---
He should have worded it such than
---
To be fair, when it comes to the classic beta unless you are in then you can‚Äôt play THAT game, so I‚Äôd put it in the same camp as television and such that lay people can‚Äôt reproduce on their own.
---
I think its a mistake on their part to only let people who are willing to shell out for bfa to be potential testers.
---
Look fine to me.
---
1.12 is the base patch theyve went with. Suppose it was the most stable and balanced.
---
haha yeah. i wanted asmond to name his guild Beta Males but he choose MAGA instead
---
He's certainly very, American, if you know what I mean...
---
DKP kinda sucks from my experience.  I joined a guild and they had dkp.  I never got anything. I'm not gonna wait til we've gotten that on farm, everyone has their gear, and I'm finally getting scraps.  Now I'm spending and they're just accumulating more..Whats the point in staying when I know I'll have to wait for the guys that were there the longest?
---
I'm excited for Classic because it did world pvp quite well since the world was much smaller but equally I enjoy playing live because I think it has by far the most engaging PvE content in the genre.
---
Some of the posts here are just ridiculous though.
---
Cept that's not how it worked at any stage of WoW unless you wanted to roll something that didn't exist at that time. There used to be guilds that never moved on from vanilla to TBC and still raided (they weren't the most common thing, but it happened). They would probably do what they are doing now, let people reserve prior to servers opening and then transfer onto that TBC server.
---
Their PvE rotations are just horrendous. I'm debating leveling one but spamming one button like a healer but in no dynamic way at all doesn't sound like a good time.
---
Have they said that 2.5k would be the cap for each layer?
---
I never said that you did either
---
I‚Äôve rolled a half dozen priests
---
And I will roll another one!
---
Inb4 ankh
---
This is how it'll go for me this time round I bet, in a dungeon im grinding anyway for pre-bis
---
It was definitely a thing back in 1.12 then. It will most likely be a thing in Classic too. Rev up the ooze caves in eastern plaguelands if you want one.
---
Whatever happened to being above the influence?!
---
Consecrate doesn't hold threat on its own. You need a smart party. It's not like Warrior AoE threat.
---
My metric for playing a class is to how well I can airdrop into things.
---
It is true unfortunately.
---
Blizzard knew there was demand for vanilla when BC came out. Nost didn't tell them anything they already didn't know.
---
This staff is slightly worse than Mageblade plus AV offhand I think. But yea, you're right, it's a catchup to an extent. AB rep just takes so long that PvEers rarely bother (unlike with AV lol).
---
My first hunter was like lvl 30 and someone in my party said "You dont have any talents."  I got pissed and was like "u suck noob" or something like that. Thankfully they weren't half the asshat I was and said "No, your talent points. You have \*x\* many to improve your skills. Press "N" and you'll see".  
---
Man, I felt completely retarded.
---
Everyone I‚Äôve seen get in so far was subbed on 2004/2005.
---
Makes me wonder if I should soon for beta. I have a day one account as well.
---
I heal with mouse over macros and the blizz raid frames. Never breaks with updates, so it's what I use.
---
They cannot beat a rogue mage team in vanilla. You just sap/blind/net/freeze/sheep/gouge the warrior and dps down the healer. Only paladins can live through, so your strategy is to force out pally cds, reset fight, and then do the same thing but kill the pally this time.
---
Thats awesome :)
---
I'm on board with this list, for sure.
---
Did the update, a lot nicer. 
---
What you could do (as a suggestion) leave the smoke/steam at the lower right corner and the ashes, even on the black bars, creates an even more 3d effect. 
---
The issue was with the lava at Ragnaro's "feet" and his hammer that were kinda glitching out. I think the ashes on the entire screen was kinda cool. Thanks again, really awesome.
---
Btw how did you manage to create this effects, is it with that phone app?
---
At least make the RP-PVE server into RP-PVP.
---
Lets be honest with eachother here. 
---
It is much more than a 'little' help
---
I think I remember Felwood was also good for farming them. Can't wait!
---
Shaman and druid. They just don't have the aesthetic I like. Too tree-huggy and natural.
---
I get you dude, the beta does need people to test gameplay, find bugs and report them but if anyone is like me or anyone else I know they're just pumped to play.
---
&gt;  but how many people are going to stick around for the grind and lack of QoL features like dungeon finder.
---
You seem to forget that people dont want these systems for good reason. Vanilla constantly increased in player numbers. I dont expect that to happen this time though; everyone who want to play will be there in the beginning.
---
I think I dinged 60 in UD Stratholme. I was a dungeon junkie so I tanked that place and Scholo a lot for guildies and randoms. Chances are I'll probably do it there again. There's great loot in there so it's worth running a lot.
---
Trolls are probably better for PVE because Berserking can help spam heals and keep the raid up. PvP is a toss up between Troll/UD because UD get WOTF and Devouring Plague, however the same Berserking can be used to spam Mana Burn which is one of the most devastating spells in PvP.... Also trolls get Hex of Weakness which is pretty incredible AND they get a 3 charge self buff which gives 3 chances to proc Blackout vs the UD only getting 1 charge on their Touch of Weakness Spell. 
---
It's a very tough decision because they are both so good in their own ways. I played UD Priest in classic, was kicking around the idea of Troll this time but I'll probably stay UD because Nostalgia, but still Troll is just as good and maybe even better than UD in a lot of ways.
---
Debating Druid or Shaman (or something else if you can suggest haha). For the record, I'm okay with healing at endgame PvE.
---
Currently playing a druid (39) on a pserver, and while I love the fact that he is faster, has swim form, stealth, essentially a bunch of qol mechanics, I can't help but feel frustrated as the class feels like a puddle-deep sea.  Does it pick up at 60? Do the feeling and flow of the class merge more or less later, because currently it's as if I'm a pseudodamage dealer due to speccing feral, but still worse than true DD classes, with a few gimped healing/casting spells. I understand that I shouldn't be like a true DD, cause that would make the class OP. Do you see what I'm saying though?
---
I leveled a Shaman to 18, and I liked most things, except how I have to spam totems at every pull and the class seems lackluster in terms of mobility. Is that true? How is the Shaman later on? I really love the fantasy of a magical melee fighter, but I've read that Enh endgame is boring and purely PNG with no outplay potential. Is this a fact?
---
Unfortunately I have never played WoW extensively, even less so vanilla, so my experience is very lackluster. I'm going Horde so no pally. Any other suggestions and opinions?
---
Thank you scriptcraft tbh
---
This is a new version of the game, it is not built from 1.12, it only imitates it. As such, the exact mechanics may be different and should be tested now that the beta is here. You can't assume everything is going to work like it did in 1.12. The entire point of the beta is to test the build.
---
That‚Äôs one of the things I miss the most about classic. As someone who had only played single player RPGs before WoW, it was refreshing to be just an adventurer exploring the world instead of being a big hero saving it. I can‚Äôt wait to relive this come August.
---
Nah. I'm just right
---
Go for the race you like aesthetically, imo. Some will say dwarf priest or troll shaman is better, because of the racials, but I honestly think it's better to play what you like the looks of. Like an orc shaman? Go for that, they're great. Like a nelf priest? Go for it, who cares their racial skill is not useful in raids.
---
He's a warlock though????
---
Yeah you're right. Sorry I didn't understand if you meant vanilla as it was or vanilla if it could be realised with more computing power.
---
It was invited an hour prior to my post.
---
Hundred
---
That's a good point too. We've had lots of clips and reports of bugs from streams on here.
---
Does anyone have the old comic where the Tauren warrior and Troll rogue got stealth-eaten by the Devilsaur? That was always my favorite.
---
That's what I overheard on this sub. Also apparently the layer size in the beginning will be much smaller (with more layers), to actually make the launch starting zones playable.
---
Have a day 1 acct on my Bnet, but the time is on a much much newer account.
---
Pretty sure he means that if it wasn‚Äôt for the outcry from people about nost being shut down blizz wouldn‚Äôt have done classic wow.
---
no, that was tbc pre patch.
---
They're using a font addon.
---
They‚Äôll totally get one more if they invite me
---
that would be the best case scenario but i don't think they are up for it yet..
---
There are definitely DPS charts available for vanilla content. They are parses of players in top raiding guilds that raided over the course of years and years of attempts. It is definitely worth noting that most of the charts people point to now are from private servers. Im not sure if there are charts that compare top "potential" dps between classes given a particular patch or set of gear or even raid boss.
---
I looked at your video and I'm pretty sure that's Burning Crusade or WOTLK. Nobody was doing near 9k dps in vanilla.
---
Here's an example of dps charts from a pserver. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg&amp;t=12s
---
Pretty sure I was in either Winterspring or EPL. It's been too long and I had a few alts I leveled to 60.
---
I had every class at 110, that is how interested I was with all the classes. Though I mained a Ele Shaman. Guardian druid was my second most played, both of which I loved quite a bit. I felt like their class hall and their artifacts added more depth and joy to them. Now in BfA, i can't even bring myself to get more than one 120.
---
People racing to 30 provides good data to the devs as well as it is potentially an accurate usage model of the game. Its very likely most players will be leveling as hard as possible upon release - devs can model things such as respawn rates and such based on this type of data.
---
Thanks for clarifying
---
Because many of the features that people now hate were added due to massive casual demand, such as smaller raids, flying mounts, LFR, etc.
---
People wanted these things and would bitch non stop. They got added and ruined the game.
---
-495
---
&gt; Do some bg's around 18-19, 28-29, 38-39, and 48-49 
---
Didn't WOW launch with BG's running 11-20, 21-30, etc?
---
All of your achievements in Vanilla mean nothing now. Prepare to painstakingly work through them all again. . . .
---
Did blizzard not already give a rough timeline of content release?  MX/Ony available on release, BWL and ZG later, etc, etc?
---
It's not like they're just dumping the game out with Naxx right out the gates.
---
-said the mustard tiger, not realizing he didn't know how vanilla worked.
---
Cool idea, I dinged 60 for the first time in Scholomance
---
Forever in theory. They can run the first cycle of phases. Can run ladder seasons after that with faster phases while waiting for a tbc transition.
---
No. I have mixed feelings.  If I could I don't even know if I would sub because of the same reasons, but also because I just don't want to lose my progress.  
---
The only reason I kind of want to is to play the diff classes again to see if I actually want to play some more than others in practice.
---
Toooo beeee fffffaaaaaiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrr
---
That's not exactly how Vanilla skill trees worked. You don't need to go full Holy in order to effectively heal dungeons. Most talents past Illumination are strictly raid-only talents. Not that you can't use them outside of raids, but that they're simply not necessary until the particular damage patterns present only in raiding.
---
Holy is still a melee spec. It's not a caster.
---
Follow this build: I guess you can call it a [‚ÄúRet/Holy hybrid‚Äù](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzMwAAEMONzzQ) because healing dungeons is the most efficient way to farm the necessary 2H weapons to make leveling as Paladin the most satisfying experience. Thankfully, dipping 20 points into Holy does little to affect your damage because your DPS comes almost entirely from the top-end of your weapon.
---
The first 11 points in Ret are the ‚Äúdamage‚Äù package of Paladin builds and gives you the most bang for your buck: *Benediction -&gt; Deflection -&gt; SoC.* Because of a mechanic called [Parry-haste](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry), you should pick Deflection instead of Imp. Judgement (which is useless with SoC) and Imp. SotC (also worthless.)
---
This means healing with a 2H, or switching to a 1H + Healing Off-hand for dungeons. Wearing a shield is going to do very little for you. Unless you care about the aesthetic of running around with a shield.
---
#Talents:
---
**Imp. BoM**
---
This is a waste of talent points since [it doesn't scale well](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a93mk8/paladin_levelling_talents_benediction_or_imp_might/ecgiude/?context=0). Mana is always going to be an issue so Benediction is your best friend here‚Äîyou'll be Sealing and Judging *a lot*.
---
**Seal of the Crusader:**
---
Seal of the Crusader is obsolete in patch 1.12 [because of a bug that they probably won't fix.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ak3qqw/should_all_bugs_be_fixed_even_if_they_were/) Don't even buy SotC from the trainer, it's pretty much always a DPS-loss. 
---
**Pursuit of Justice:**
---
After SoC I'd recommend PoJ since distance will be your biggest efficiency-killer while leveling. Can't stress the importance of +8% run speed.
---
**Sanctity Aura:**
---
Mathematically, Ret aura beats Sanc aura because of poor stat scaling while leveling. This only changes if ~~you~~ your guild allows you to gear for full Ret endgame DPS.
---
**Imp. Judgement:**
---
You should be using rank 1 SoC to level, which means never Judging it because you actually lose DPS by doing so. Not Judging SoC makes this talent worthless.
---
**SoR vs SoC:**
---
Seal of Righteousness is very close to Seal of Command. The break point between the two is weapon speed. SoC does a bit more DPS with a weapon speed of 3.5+ (Smight's Mighty Hammer, for example) than with SoR. SoR does more DPS with a faster weapon. Two sides of the same coin.
---
The reason I (and most Paladin leveling guides) recommend rushing SoC is because you're already rushing the Ret tree and if you can get Smite's Mighty Hammer from a Deadmines run you'll be a DPS machine until Verigan's Fist‚Äîor even longer because you need a high level player to run you through Shadowfang Keep for VF, and that might be impossible on a fresh server.
---
Regardless of whether you get VF or not, SoC will continue being useful up to level 60 since you should be targeting slow two-handers throughout your leveling experience.
---
**Healing Light**
---
You might as well get this to improve your dungeon healing (you should be building a healing set with +Healing cloth pieces and off-hands) and then two points into:
---
**Imp. Lay on Hands**
---
This is the most controversial choice but Lay on Hands is so much better on Tanks than BoP since BoP suspends threat and only causes another party member to get one-shot instead. Giving your tank +30% armor for 2 minutes in addition to the emergency heal is more effective than Consecration or two points in Divine Strength.
---
After this, get Illumination. I'm skipping Consecration since it's useless while leveling as a non-tank. It's insane how inefficient Consecration is. I think a lot of people are blinded by guides that glorify AoE grinding around level 50+. AoE grinding won't be a thing while leveling at launch because grinding spots will be contested by other players (especially Mages) who can AoE much more efficiently than you.
---
**Illumination**
---
This talent is all you need to heal effectively until 60. Get Divine Intellect and Spiritual Focus because this becomes your most powerful healing combo with Concentration Aura (spell pushback is huge in Classic.) Avoid Divine Strength because you won't be getting enough Strength rating on your gear for this to scale well and since you're not equipping a shield it won't help you mitigate damage either.
---
#Additional info:
---
Don't waste gold on the following spells / ranks: Seal of the Crusader, Exorcism, Divine Protection ranks, Redemption ranks, Turn Undead, Hammer of Justice ranks, Lay on Hands ranks, Seal of Justice, Holy Wrath, Divine Shield, Blessing of Sacrifice. You won't stick around undead areas long enough while leveling in the early levels to justify the Undead-only spells. Maybe once you start hitting EPL you can pick those up.
---
#Stat priority:
---
+Healing  &gt; +Spell Crit &gt; Mp5 &gt; Intellect. 
---
Keep in mind that at very early levels you'll be mostly aiming for Spirit &gt; Intellect &gt; Stamina. Don't worry about Strength because most of your damage will come from the top-end of your Weapon.
---
Warrior. My skills are like what, running and shouting? I  can already do that in real-life - give me some actual fantasy.
---
Haha 
---
I want to see his face, when he enters molten core on real blizzard servers the first time
---
I mean when early level 6 zones are so different vs privat servers, how different will raids be?
---
it looks so fun in the montages. I kno the wf crits are rare but dang i bet it was satisfying. Oh well .. Maybe they will buff them later if the community warms up to the post naxx content :O
---
&gt; Why do so many people blame flying mounts for the cause of all the  disarray in modern wow? Like flying was never the problem with the new  design philosophies. The problem was making things at large easier for a  wider audience while making it trivial for the hardcore audience. 
---
People forget that TBC and WOTLK, arguably some of the expansions/states of the game, with the most World PvP, had flying mounts. Because they all had stuff to do at ground level, especially TBC.
---
Haven‚Äòt even signed up for the beta, but nice try :)
---
A serious, all business WoW streamer would be so boring to watch.

Alexensual made fun of Tipsout in a Youtube comment and he took as harassment and tried to SWAT Alexensual, when in terms of internet banter it was a pretty mild and non-threatening comment.
---
I think my original hit 60 in burning steppes fighting those red ogres. Not sure exactly where it was, but they had a cave thing in a small hill/mountain in the zone.
---
I also remember Paladin stuff dropping when were were raiding. Horde side obviously.

Trolls are just tauren who spec'd into tusks instead of horns.

The inclusion of a gearscore-like addon into Classic is inevitable.

---
I dont see the point of doing a hypothetical fight. You think you are right, I say you are not. It is what it is.
---
Hardcore players (vocal minority) are usually "T O X I C" because they don't want casuals (the vocal majority) suggesting changes on things they aren't even good at which is usually the case in most games that involve high skill gaps. It's up to the devs to sift through the casual suggestions on gameplay design and choose what is best for the game. The issue with that is, you get a conflict of interest where what's best for the game's design doesn't result in maximum profit which leads to what retail is.
---
so i just purchased wow and new to the game.
---
is there a difference between classic wow and the normal one with all the expansions?
---
How does it appear on the website?  Can't check my client, as I'm at work.
---
58 - 60 on EPL skellies for me.
---
That's how I remember it as well. Though I only got my rogue to about level 40 before TBC.
---
I personally am fine if they left it not needing to empty the bag first. Seems like it was like that originally due to technical limitations (only a guess)
---
And I‚Äôll be wearing you wearing his garters guts
---
Imagine thinking difficulty is a bad thing.
---
AH scanning just let's plebs know what the no-lifers do.
---
At some point during vanilla, I discovered that you could survive fall damage at full health as a warrior by just turning on defensive stance, instead of taking 100% of your life as damage, you'd only take 90% and survive. I'm super curious if they ever fixed that before 1.12 or if it still works.
---
But that's why people play, for the challenge.   
---
The one thing i am expecting is a lot of complaining and even articles complaining about the investment needed. The same awful journalists who complained about sekiro being too hard will complain about the months and months of investment needed to progress in classic.
---
I thought it was funny
---
Aw well thats fine anyway
---
then you played during the TBC pre-patch (you'd be amazed how 1 MONTH completely over-rode everyone's memories of the rest of classic) OR it was the bracers/belt in MC.
---
Those are the ONLY class specific pieces that could drop. Because they dropped from trash and could traded across the neutral AH.
---
Thank you! I just confirmed this with some research. Alliance it is.
---
no... not like this
---
3 months til release. Blizzard is sweating
---
TIL respawns = phasing
---
They really just need to revamp Modern WoW leveling mainly. Make it more interesting like Vanilla.. add a bit more RPG elements. It‚Äôs already slow atm but so painfully boring and nothing you do matters. Make it more interesting... and if you don‚Äôt like it, buy a boost. 
---
Leveling has always been my favourite part about WoW and it sucks now.
---
I don't mean to be a debbie downer... but I'm pretty sure the ship has sailed for Blizzard. Activision seems to have taken over all major decisions. 
---
Classic is going to be fine because there is no room for people insert development. The only reason we aren't seeing a cash shop because it would result in a complete revolt and rejection of the entire project and they know that.
---
Classic is the last good product Blizzard is going to make. I hope I'm wrong, but all the signs seem to point to this conclusion.

---
"I'm not sure why?"
---
haha this man is made of cheese.
---
I mean one despawned as two spawned, that seems a bit odd for simple respawns no?
---
I personally don't care about that but the character voices sound different.
---
The fact that you're wearing rose-tinted goggles saddens me. Literally look at the mechanics of bosses from both states of the game and compare them. I like Vanilla way more than retail, but objectively looking, Retail raiding, even at heroic, is MUCH more hard than Vanilla ever was. This is with people parsing at top 1% and having fully simulated gear/enchants/whatever, for maximum performance. There's a reason why Naxxramas when it's released on private servers are cleared within the first reset, because these people have done it before and because the actual content isn't that hard anymore, because people are not mostly idiots in terms of game knowledge, as they were back then.
---
1 out of 1000, they have no idea how bad it is...
---
I too was in Winterspring, grinding ghosts on the frozen lake. I took a SS and immediately hearthstoned back to Org.
---
Not respawns. As you can see the mob he‚Äôs fighting disappeared and 2 new mobs appeared.
---
Indeed.
---
Sidenote: Trolls are super tall and stand out like a sore thumb. if you want to stay low-key and not get noticed being Undead gives you a much smaller character and easier to blend in with other Horde.
---
Murlocs and gnolls... man vanilla was harsh.
---
Thats terrible, wow...
---
TBD as we get closer it's looking more and more like the entire current active retail raid roster as well as a lot of our inactive raiders are planning on playing Classic.  Some with the intent to just play around for a bit and then coming back to retail, but it's increasingly seeming like some of use are seriously considering staying in classic.
---
The OP didn't say any such thing. They're merely suggesting that those who never played vanilla might benefit from taking it slow. Rush your ass off if that's what you want to do...
---
I've got other things to do and if I am going to flirt with burn-out I might as well play the "real" game.
---
Eh. I prefer PvE servers because I cba to pvp most of the time. Notg having the option at all would be depressing though so fuck that.

Stance dancing is one of the best parts of the warrior class.

Nah, it doesn't. It has an impact on economy, but not much. Tokens don't create gold. It just moves the gold into another bag. So no hyper inflation or stuff.
---

---
I feel like there are a lot of players who hear that Warriors are gods and Paladins have always been the popular class for whatever reason. I think once they hit like level 15 a lot of them are going to have second thoughts.
---
Nothing wrong with being a clicker, I did MC and BWL progression as a healer clicker. Just needed to top of on redbull before raiding.
---
If he phased, then the mob he was fighting would despawn. That's how it usually works on live.
---
No, you're right, most do. That's also kinda the joke in the comic. Different classes have different ways of avoiding fall dmg.
---
They won't ever do that.
---
I recently leveled a druid on a private server, and I kind of get what you mean. Kevin Jordan did go into detail on this, on Countdown To Classic. They were intended to really use all forms, very often. Not kill 3 mobs in cat, swap out to heal, go back to cat. He said the worst reason for that was shapeshifting costs so much mana. You can probably do 6-8 shapeshifts before you're OOM, so even if there is alot of incentive to swap to bear to stun/charge, go cat to backstab, pop out to heal, and then go boomkin to blow them up... you would be oom in 10 seconds.
---
Resto is really fun to raid heal as, sucks to heal 5 mans, but makes you a good healer. If you want to play druid id say do it. I played druid on the last pServer and raided through AQ40 and had a blast. And I don't normally play healer, usualy melee dps, but druid felt like such a high skill class that i always wanted to get better in PVP/PVE so I was always trying new things which made it never get old.
---
Take about 5 to 10 off there bud
---
Skinning + Herbalism tho.
---
No its not. Mortal Strike will push off very important debuffs and the DPS is garbage. You can probably get away with it in MC. But if you push off an ignite in AQ or a nightfall proc, you are reducing more dps than you are doing.
---
I doubt it

A red-orange-colored, citrus-cherry-flavored Mountain Dew first released in August 2007 for a total of 12 weeks to promote the release of Halo 3, an Xbox 360 game. This flavor has had a limited return to shelves in 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 to promote World of Warcraft, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Halo 4, Dead Rising 3, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Titanfall 2 respectively, each time with redesigned packaging to promote its associated video game. Additionally, it is sold in 16 oz. bottles on [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com). Its taste has been compared to "LiveWire", "Code Red" and the energy drink AMP Overdrive. From 2017 until early 2018 it was seen in Arbys restaurant fountains across America
---
&gt;I feel like classic is a wake-up call to Blizzard.
---
I don't believe so. They're two different games for two different kinds of audiences. 
---
If anything, they have learned there's still a audience for the old version of WoW, that's all.
---
Apparently we can't be friends.
---
Even if this is true people who come back to play WoW classic are not going to stop and play retail. If anything if they stop classic they will just take another long break.

Thumbs up if you thought the Hamstring icon was an axe, not a polearm
---
Is it really elitist to not want to play with people who don't want to play the game?
---
If you don't enjoy the game and that's harming the experience for other people then I don't want to play with you because i find the concept of intentionally making the game worse for others reprehensible.
---
If looking out for other players like that is elitism and/or gatekeeping then that's a couple of labels I'll happily take on me.
---
This happens with these mobs on private servers too
---
After watching all these beta videos, I‚Äôm actually surprised how few bugs there are. There have been a few minor ones, but for the most part, I think 3 months is plenty of time to work out any issues. There will probably be some bug fixes once the live servers drop, but it‚Äôs looking smoother than expected.
---
It's not, for many reasons.
---
1. The original mob dissapears at 10% HP. No corpse, no loot, nothing.
---
2. At the same time as that mob dissapears, two other mobs appear.
---
3. If they were respawns, they would have a 4-5 second delay where they just sit there. They were from another phase, because the second they appeared, they engaged. They werent fresh respawns.
---
I want it in it's hardest possible states. I even want unerfed Cthun. They said he was impossible back then but, we are way way better now. Would love to see some crazy bastards claim his scalp.
---
Stop using streamers to warrant an argument for WoW tokens. We get it you're lazy and don't want to commit the time to farm out a gold for an epic mount/consumes if that's the case stick with BFA.
---
That's cool, but I hope they put some limits on it compared to what we've seen it do in retail. 
---
I don't know exactly what it could break in Classic, but there's no need to further trivialize ancient content.
---
I'd always choose friends over faction. But only the close friends. Even if they stop playing a month in. That month will be joyous than playing my preferred faction alone, by far. And that's including the reroll 7d have to do when they quit
---
Simple question buddy, it was already answered too.
---
Huh? People have been dying for classic footage pre-demo what's your problem with clips showing the game? are you jealous of streamers or something?
---
did they change something after restart? 2 clips super recently
---
You might get similar dps overall with arms bc you use sweeping strikes on trash. But you will never match Death Wish for single target, which is more important.
---
I played from launch thru about 3/4 of Lich King then dropped in and out of each of the subsequent expansions. I remember pally gear dropping in raids in vanilla, but dont ask me what they were or when or where they dropped.
---
&gt;TIL respawns = phasing
---
are you blind or just playing stupid?
---
2 clips regarding phasing posted in the last 10 mins.
---
Server reset 1 hour ago.
---
No clips regarding phasing posted prior to the reset.
---
Coincidence? I think not.
---
I think simple theory crafting is enough to understand why warrior + x cannot win vs mage rogue.
---
Just ask yourself, how can the warrior stop itself from being cc'd? 
---
Skull of impending doom? Okay, rogue can run away with FAP and reset, mage can iceblock and wait for the effect to wear off. After that, they cc the warrior and kill the healer.
---
Priest dispels sheep? Okay, rogue has tons of cds that can cc the warrior for at least half a minute. How can the warrior prevent itself from being CC'd?
---
If you cannot come up with any way to stop the warrior from being cc'd, then you need to think about how the healer can survive vs the dps of a mage and rogue. I think a paladin can survive once, but mage + rogue can just reset eat/drink, and come do it all over again.
---
Moar dots!
---
This is a cool clip
---
All classic players are just blinded by nostalgia and only think the want classic because pservers are free. Real player count is basically nothing.
---
That's all complete bullshit right? Of course. Just like you bullshit claim that all streamers are cancer. Generalisation of an entire set of people with which are many individuals with different attitudes and communities is retarded.
---
Jebus brist, they just activated L.A.Y.E.R.I.N.G.
---
Would be neat if they managed to convert that into moonwalking but I doubt it'll happen considering this is caused by a hunter-only bug.

Are you rolling sham?

As someone who plays more of the hardcore playstyle in classic I'd recommend UD Priest based of your post. Nelf priest is unfortunately not very sought after mainly because Fear Ward is HUGE for alliance. As for Horde there isnt really one Priest race that is better than the others for PVE, but for PVP UD Priest (shadow) is arguably one of the best 1v1 classes in vanilla. But when it comes down to it go with your gut and have a great time :) Safe travels adventurer.

---
The first raid tier in Cata (tier 11) was a mess, since it was the first attempt at balancing 10 and 25 man and their heroic counterparts to be equally difficult since they rewarded the same amount of loot. Spoilers: that won't ever work. Certain boss fights were almost impossible on 10 man while being (relatively) stupidly easy on 25 man. 
---
Then there was the more than controversial heroic dungeon nerf of 4.2. While 4.2 in itself was decent for a patch of that time(Firelands, Molten Front), they decided to nerf heroic dungeons down to be a little bit harder than heroic Wrath dungeons. Before that they were just a bit easier than TBC heroics but still required CC more than often. That was also the point people like TotalBuiscuit quit the game and coincides with the steepest drop off in player numbers at that point.
---
Then there was 4.3, which introduced the LFR (which was actually very hard relative to today's LFRs) and Dragon Soul. A relatively short raid with very forgettable bosses and the last boss being infamous for being very easy compared to Spine and not what people imagined a boss battle against Deathwing to be.
---
Then we had 10 months of meh content until MoP launched.
---
Then, as you mentioned, the love for the old zones and the hate for the revamped versions. Most of the hate was for Ashenvale, Darkshor, Barrens and Stranglethorn, since those were the zones most affected by the revamps. Another problem was that most of the development went into revamping Kalimdor and EK, which is also the reason we haven't seen another zone revamp of such scale  ever since and maybe won't ever see.
---
Most of the people were actually hyped to fly in the old zones. The irony is that around mid cata to early MoP the flying haters started to become louder, which is the reason flying didn't even get implemented in WoD until the flying supporters got louder, which is why we got the compromise of the Pathfinder achievement.
---
PvP guilds never really made alot of sense IMO. You don't need a guild to find a premade.
---
&gt; You seem to forget that people dont want these systems for good reason
---
I honestly think the level of hatred for these systems comes at least somewhat from the fact that in this reddit echo chamber we've seen and discussed to death the absolute terminal impacts they have had on wow which is being showcased in BfA right now. A couple of my friends who raided endgame in the first 3 games and haven't touched or kept up with wow since are kinda pissed about some of these features not being there. My theory is that in Wrath the effects were still somewhat mild; people still talked in auto dungeons, there was still a possibility of getting ganked while leveling, the original continents weren't completely changed and streamlined. So in their eyes this is just shooting yourself in the foot just to say you did it *while* injured. To really understand why it's better not to have these things, you have to put in the time. Something people seem to have less of these days
---
yeah, its funny that neither fanservers nor in-house blizzard techs can seem to recreate how well WoW used to work
---
I think Tauren is better for Elemental. While Orc is better for enhance. I would say resto can go either way but, I would still lean a little Tauren. That aoe stun is fukin nutz for a hybrid class. It's either a juicy heal. Or lightning death.
---
Hi, /u/Author_33
---
They listened to the negative layering feedback and added sharding back
---
People are very salty they didn't get into the beta. Also, there just seems to be a streamer hate boner around here for some reason.
---
This is just a clip of nothing.
---
he said he tested it when some of the streamers got access to the alpha for 6 hours or w.e
---
Don‚Äôt even remember my first 60 ding...probably in BRD because I ran that dungeon almost every day for months. I know my first 70 though, Terrokar Forest bear Auchindoun just grinding mobs.
---
I must say I doubt the end game was the selling point of the game for the majority of players. Hell, I'm curious if the majority even made it to 60.
---
I agree with OP, though. If you're a new player you should take your time and enjoy it the way you want to. I bet a lot of new players are watching the streamers stressing about 1-10 practice runs and stuff as if it's the most important thing in the world, but it's just not for a new player. 
---
They're just not going to be ahead of the curve on their first ever character, they won't be able to capitalize on the benefits of being one of the first high levels and they are going to miss out on a ton of stuff if they try to rush it.
---
If you've been through the journey 6 times you already know what's important to you so skipping a dungeon or zone means nothing.
---
Rushing and sweating their way to 60 for months to reach the end game, only to find that the end game offers literally the same experience only bigger, more repetitive and with a much slower character growth. Guides will say to skip RFC, but that first dungeon with 4 other random players is many times more epic than the 88 BRDs, raidlogging, honor grind and consumable farming awaiting in the end game.
---
Very few new players will benefit from rushing, but the few players that does will know who they are and naturally seek to do it.
---
Thank you brotha
---
That automatic DING announcer was annoying. lol
---
Was that rogue really lvl 11?
---
No it was not, but you could log off mid flight to exit at next stop.
---
Engineer is my favorite class.
---
no it was not. not in TBC either.
---
I disagree. You can make friends in Retail indeed, but it's way less natural /common. TBH I hardly remember having any conversation in a dungeon since Cata heroics. You join into a dungeon from LFG with people who aren't from your server, who have fresh characters you'll forget about and whom you'll never meet again, people barely say "hi" or "goodbye", you just rampage through the whole dungeon mindlessly spamming a couple buttons for 15 minutes, rince and repeat. 
---
This is an issue that has many causes. Some of them are : interserver BGs/LFG/LFR, LFG/LFR themselves which, due to queing, are completely impersonal, mass rerolling mixed with fast leveling which makes everybody have way more characters, hence not making you remember the names of the people you're playing with, getting ride of downtime (regen) and need for CCs in Dungeons, which were always a reason to communicate, along with making them shorter and overall easier, making you less likely to bond with teammates. 
---
Generally speaking WoW became an ever more single player-friendly game since Vanilla, which ***always*** happens to the detriment of the community/social multiplayer aspect. Maybe you're still able to make friends casually nowadays ; many people aren't. And I'm one of them too.
---
I believe not, but don't recall.
---
And that‚Äôs why it takes 20 minutes to make the run from Grom‚Äôgol to Booty Bay.
---
Priest and Rogue. I have it 60 on just about every class but I know for a fact these two have never been over 40. Priest is just boring with the wand and I never liked stealthy classes in most games. Mage would be on this list if I didn‚Äôt recently fall in love with the class.
---
Good for Ron Jeremy's son.
---
or just don't use the rested system
---
This comic is 100% still relevant to modern wow.
---
Oh wow, first evidence of non-contiguous beta realm as far as I know. Based on this it looks like he was layered/phased for either:
---
1) some reason other than guild/party invite (population reason maybe?)
---
2) something bugged out.
---
This never happened until just now, did they add phasing in to handle the new crowd of people that entered the beta? Or is their new layering system failing them? This should not be happening with layering.
---
Which is the opposite from what we're hearing. Which is that SM Ruin is still very gank proof in the world.
---
I doubt it, classic is based on legion and im pretty sure both of those things are fixed.
---
You are completing ignoring the fact that Blizzard should respond to player feedback. That's just being smart as a business.
---
Straight up can't sheep tapped/tagged mobs.
---
One of my favorites u/SoupaSoka
---
No. You couldn't even fly through flightpoints for a big part of vanilla.
---
My take-away: "smart small" (their words, not my typo)... Brb, investigating a smart small.
---
No, but you could achieve the same effect by logging off mid-flight, since your destination wouldn't save and it'd take you to the nearest stop as a failsafe. The Classic developers said they're going to leave it in because of that, since it's just an alternative way to do something you used to be able to do through a side-effect of the game logic.
---
As I recall, no.  If you wanted to get off the flight path early in Vanilla I think you had to log out.  Then when you logged back in, your flight ended at the next flight point.
---
Actually warlocks are good in 1.12 classic, they needed in raids and best in pvp 1 vs 1.
---
I was on an RP-PvP server in Vanilla.  I played a female Night Elf Druid.  I had a guy I played with a lot mistake my role playing a girl for me actually being a girl.  It was about 6 months before I figured out he wasn't role playing at all, and just thought I was a girl.  I had to pretend I didn't have a microphone on vent so he wouldn't hear me.  A friend of his heard me on vent and told him I was a guy, and he got into a fight with the friend, saying it must have just been my husband playing my character.  I just went along with it, because at that point, it had been almost 9 months of him believing I was actually a girl.  
---
Moral of the story: don't play on an RP server if you're not actually going to RP, lest you believe everyone playing a girl is actually female in real life.
---
Sorry if i came off as rude. While were on the topic of elementals though, I never enjoyed them as a frost mage. Felt like a weaker pet class, but with less character, personally. TBC wasn't great to frostmages in general though.
---
Hi, /u/DeMeLoNiA
---
In all fairness I find live logging way easier to drill down into wipes. So I rarely use those features anyway. I think the thing is that details (iirc) came out at a time when skada was lacking some of these features and the key one being correct parsing of absorbed damage. The shielded boss in High maul showed incorrect dps on recount and skada since some of the dps was absorbed, details worked correctly. That was what made me swap originally.
---
IDK -dude. We can all agree mistakes were made!
---
It was not in vanilla, how ever you could achieve the same thing by logging out mid flight and it would drop you off at the next flight point you pass.
---
So they put the request too feature in just for convenience.
---
That one was surprisingly easy if you were an Alchemist. Once people discovered Lesser Underwater Breathing Potions... I think I funded a chunk of my mounts with those.
---
I'd say Uldir was rather meh. Not excellent but not bad either. Taloc was nice (literally elevator boss), Mother had good design but could've been executed better, Zek'voz was such a well rounded fight overall and Zul could have been one of the best fights but ultimately fell flat due to a single class mechanic in the form of sub rogues.
---
Hey Ultra Supreme Pleb Lord, get over it bud.
---
Blizz would never tacitly ensure pservers. It's against their legal and economic interests
---
My bad, since OP mentioned mobs in his post, I assumed we were speaking about PVE.
---
This is just my opinion but, I feel like Blizzard isn't really going to learn much. They ideally see classic as "some of our audience prefers Classic" and the rest of the audience prefer BFA/modern WoW. 
---
I feel like this is a wrong way to think/approach and whether Blizzard actually thinks or feels that way is obviously questionable. I do feel like they have lots to learn from Classic. People want an MMORPG. It's in the name. People want a community, lots of players, a sense of an enormous world, challenging content, and feel like they are apart of something, etc. 
---
I'm sorry but seeing a dead world isn't fun. Not having to work hard for gear isn't fun. Content that is a freeze and easily accessible isn't fun. Lack of customization for classes isn't fun, a lack of class identity isn't fun. Yes, I get it there are casuals (I have a career now too so I can relate) and they want content to be easily accessible. I get the appeal to try to give everyone something in the game. But let's be honest it is really backfiring and killing the game overtime whether you like it or not. 
---
You want to know why Classic, BC, WOTLK were considered the best time of WoW? Because character progression took time and effort. Content was easy and you could just queue up and do whatever in 15 minutes and get epic loot. Classes had specific pros/cons and identities to them. You felt like this small character in a giant world and weren't some epic savior of everything getting cats out of the trees and picking up crap for farmers 24/7.
---
Stl?
---
\+1 this may be a deal-breaker for me. I still want to play as near to hardcore as I can get, so I'm not trying to get started more than 3 months after everyone else. Without PvP the stakes are too low and everything is too easy, and without RP, you wind up surrounded by trolls, griefers, and people who just don't give a damn - which I personally find really undermines the experience/immersion.  
---
I'll probably still be a tourist for a while, but it feels like my odds of sticking with classic in the long-term are much lower if there's no RPPvP server at launch.
---
This not because of hit % is because in vanilla if you jumped forward as a warrior charged, you still retained your momentum while stun in the air but the warrior would stop were you jumped from thus never catch up.
---
There were some pvper that were so good at this it was ridiculous.
---
Frostadamus produces some good content. Otherwise not really. They all try and push out as much content as possible and as fast as possible which means it's full of errors and not very well done.
---
You forgot about dying though, you can do that so, so, SO much more as a warrior than in real life
---
I dont expect classic to "shut down" or end. 
---
So I'll be leveling at least 2 alts.   
---
When I'm ready to.  But I'm rushing to 60 to establish my presence in a raiding guild and will start my alts when I'm fully decked and set up for raid logging.
---
Also [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/InventiveSlipperyBaguetteKAPOW) .
---
Im baffled by anyone who defends sharding 2.0 in classic.
---
It puts such a nice skill cap to separate good from the bad
---
Warrior. Just eugh.. Pure torture. I'd rather level a priest only being allowed to put points into Discipline than play a warrior normally.
---
I have this weird thing, where my brain for some ungodly reason can't seem to connect warrior abilities' animations to them going off. It's like I just don't *feel* them going off and I can't stand the sensation.
---
I used to have a screenshot of our deadmines group all sitting in separate mine carts in a train, right at the start of the instance - way back in early 2005
---
The test is months long.
---
While not very similar it‚Äôs still a fun class, has great pvp options, and melee will suck ya totem for that windfury buff ;p
---
Ive played both priest and shaman at endgame on xyz vanilla server and personally enjoy shaman healing/pvp more than priest so do some research :)
---
Also feel less squishy
---
1.) Last time I checked, Cata came out in late 2010, not 2006.
---
2.) Seriously? LMAO talk about moving goalposts...  I just did a quick timespan search to find examples. Many wow fansites and forums that where around in vanilla time either didn't exists until late vanilla/BC or are lost to time. But since you insist...
---
Note: Dire Maul cane out Mar 2005 and 2.0.1 in Dec 2006

---
I'm sure if I had enough time I could find some more examples, but let's be honest. I've more than proven I was right at this point. Nice try though
---
I dinged 60 grinding in EPL.
---
Unsure of what happened here but I am sure its a bug.
---
Interesting, I always liked their class fantasy. The gameplay, not so much though. Feels relatively slow in gameplay, but also relatively safe (you can get away from so many things so easily), so just not too thrilling.
---
Same. Mine was flagged around 9pm EST last night and this work day has never felt longer. 
---
Jan 2005 account, few friends with ‚Äò04/‚Äò05 accounts also got in. No email.
---
Exactly, the problem that flying mounts pose is that they make the game look smaller. I get that, and I understand it makes travel easier which is problematic in a smaller sense.
---
But the question is, if Flying is in the game why not make the world in game adjusted so that there are things to do both on the ground and in the air? They added flying mounts, but never really took it further, I'd say Blizzards problem wasn't flying mounts but not adding any systems to further flying mounts in WoW.
---
We got a couple of quests were we pilot aircrafts or flying vehicles / mounts, but they should have added some unique things we can do and see while in flight or in the air, added a minor combat system where we can throw pebbles at other flyers to attempt to dismount them, add parachutes to in air combat, give mounts special abilities like GW2 has now.
---
The problem with a lot of things in WoW was their inability to take their new amazing system and advance it in a way that was mechanically pleasing to use.
---
Imagine a mount system like Gw2 in WoW where each mount breed type would have special capabilities akin to how hunter pets have class abilities. One would leap through air at high speeds that can close large gaps, one can move very fast on land, one can travel on and underwater, one can fly, one can glide (using momentum instead of magical wings to propel), each mount could have a burst of speed ability like rogues have (had?) where on cooldown they could use this burst of speed to catch up to opponents or just simply go faster.
---
Blizzard were the first in the race to actually introduce all these cool new systems into a game and an MMO then they didn't advance them or develop them any further.
---
Its been 15 years since WoW has come out and when I mount up it does the same thing it did 15 years ago, %increased speed.
---
Boring.
---
My hopes for classic isn't the classic experience but like OP says a wake up call to blizzard on how they should conduct the future of their game.
---
I'm excited to see how Classic changes the formula for future WoW releases and if we'll possibly get a diversion from cata. (lets say deathwing wasn't a threat and we dealt with him as a prologue and then got a new expansion after Wotlk that didn't change the game as we know it for worse.)
---
It'd be like splitting the timeline in a sense, I know its a stretch but god dammit don't tell me its impossible.
---
I heard warlock in tbc was purely shadowbolt? Mists was probably superior to that
---
Kind of. I plan on making two characters. My first will be a rogue. The reason being is I am an absolute garbage rogue player. My main go to is normally Shammy or Warrior. I like to go balls deep so being sneaky is antithetical to who I am. I just want to master that play style because it's so foreign to me.
---
I do plan on leveling a Shaman second though. The reason being is that when you get into the later raids and build a BiS set. Ele shamans are pretty deadly and, I love the way they look. That being said Ele shaman is the caster version of a warrior. They suck until they don't and, it takes a while to get to that goal.
---
*Opens*
---
Oh ok, sarcasm. Haha, brain fart but we've all been there.
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, LOL rookie move
---
Honestly that PVE rotation is the best for me! I am sick of the complex rotations of some of the classes I‚Äôve mained in the past.
---
"Y-you won't even notice it goy- i mean guys!"
---
Bos also gives a good amount of mitigation. Comparable with warrior Def stance. I dont think a pala would tank any raid Bosses, and in dongeons the fights are so short you should be ok just spamming everything youve got. When you run out of mana you run out of threat, thats why raidbosses are problematic
---
Until BC :)
---
Noooo I hate this... blizzard should stop this layering sharding thing before live.
---
Isn't it a gold to turn in the quest?
---
That‚Äôs means a lot to me, thanks for the kind words friend.
---
&lt;3 have a good week mate.
---
Looks like something to report in Hope's they will fix. It's almost like it's a beta test or something.
---
I think he used back pedal, and it worked beautifully.
---
World defense hello.
---
Why avoid Holy Shield? That thing is the bees knees dude. Without that you might as well tank in holy spec for how much damage you'll be taking.
---
So once classic comes out there won't be 2 different subscriptions? 1 sub is good for both retail and classic?
---
I wish they would do some kind of physical or even collectors release of classic. Midnight release parties just like the old days.
---
It really does. I hated it at first. Once you learn it though. It feels so natural and rewarding.
---
of course!
---
That's not laying though
---
Hunter. Ammo. No thanks.
---
I understood you at "Paladin". I started having doubts about you at "hunter". But at "mage", I was entirely sure you're just a generally bad person!
---
(jk ;)
---
Perplexity is the best for rogue PvP bar none
---
Misdirect was introduced in TBC
---
Considering this is the biggest MMO release in years I can see this starting well. I'm just not sure how well this will hold up. I honestly dont see alot of people sticking around for 40 man raiding. Particularly if they end up in a casual meme spec guild that is either not progressing or progressing slowly. Since it takes longer to level there will be even more people leaving when they find out that their hybrid class choice is best as a healer in raiding and they have no interest in healing. The PvP in the game, while fun, can be horribly imbalanced either against dedicated twinks, while leveling, or against T2 or better geared people at 60. 
---
Personally, I cant wait to dive in and live in WoW again. Dwarf priest will be my main with a druid or Pally being my "primary" alt. With that said, I'm not oblivious to a number of issues that Classic presents to potential players. In a day and age where "rewards" come in a fairly short period of time during short play periods and people expect relative balance, Classic doesnt provide any of that at all. While I fully expect a healthy playerbase I dont see it being a super smash hit long term. A number of systems that are integral to Classic are not conducive to the current market
---
I would go for SoC @ 20. You don't need conc to tank dungeons right away and your kill speed while questing will be abysmal if you start holy. Not to mention you don't get pursuit of justice which is a big deal.
---
BoS instead of sanc aura when going lvl 60 dungeons.
---
Played warrior exclusively through vanilla/tbc. The only time I felt like a god was when I had a pocket healer in pvp. Soloing was dreadful. Only being valued as a tank in raiding was dreadful.    
---
I ended up dropping 100g daily at one point switching between specs.
---
DO IT! My buddy is planning on shaman ‚Äútanking‚Äù. We‚Äôre running 4 man leveling group with a priest, a rogue, and a warlock. So our voidwalker will do most of the work and our shaman will do something. He will probably respec after leveling but it‚Äôs gonna be super fun!
---
No idea. However, as someone who hasn't touched WoW in 10 years and just found out about classic two days ago, I've been trying to get my SO to play with me in Sept for the last two days - he's never played wow. I'm hoping there are more people like me and I'm hoping logging in again after so many years' absence will feel like coming home. I suspect the initial popularity will  calm down quite a bit after people like me have got their fix of nostalgia and the modern-day players decide it's not their cup of tea. With that said, my fear is not that I won't enjoy it the second time around, it's that I will get addicted again.
---
Either a bug or they are purposely testing it out. You can see this clip has the exact same timestamp as this dude https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultProtectivePlumPhilosoraptor . They probably force 'layered' the entire continent to make sure it worked.  
---
Obviously it's not meant to happen mid fight for no reason.
---
No, please do rush to 60 so I can level in peace at a leisurely pace :p
---
Savix is a bit of a spicy chicken memer but he is great at pvp and maining a rogue
---
He has no idea how much more fun the Hunter is with that kind of stuff. I started playing in TBC and it really was a struggle at first to make sure your pet didn't abandon you and to train its abilities, to make sure you had ammo at all times etc. But the struggle was totally worth it and I was so immersed in my class. Now in BFA Hunters just feel lifeless and boring compared to that.
---
Same thing for me. It's about being a person in the world of Azeroth during classic. Not some demigod appointed as such because they need a reason for you being able to destroy every bad guy who's ever existed in Warcraft lore.
---
that is just between zones
---
That wasnt layering.
---
"If you're alliance, Arms with a 2h will do comparable or better DPS than 2h Fury since sword spec is a native 5% CoH for an extra swing, and HoJ adds 2% to that. 7% total CoH for extra swings is quite significant. "  
---
Fury can still wear HoJ. Its a 5% difference. Flurry is way more dps, and increases your chance to proc somethng like a Ironfoe or HoJ. Your extra swing can miss. This is a bad argument.   
---
Sweeping Strikes can add some good AoE utility for situations like MC imps, BWL suppression room, etc.   
---
Sweeping Strikes is the only reason you are seeing comparable dps to fury. But that is on aoe trash that doesn't matter at all. Single Target bosses your dps is more important and wear dps warrior shines.  
---
For early raids like MC and BWL the debuff slot min/maxing doesn't matter that much. As long as you have the important ones like sunders, curse of elements, demo shout, thunderclap, etc. you have some wiggle room for a few debuff slots. AQ and Naxx is where min/maxing becomes a bit more important.   
---
This is correct. But, even in MC or BWL, if you push off a Nightfall proc, then you are really having a negative effect on DPS overall.   
---
The only reason to be Arms is so you can PVP without respeccing. This is a luxury every warrior in your raid would desire. But its not realistic. The good warriors will just respec. Then you will be in there being lazy as Arms expecting to get prio on every 2h pvp weapon over the warriors that actually put in effort. I have seen it in pvp focused guilds, otherwise, Its a good way to make ppl dislike you.
---
you now you need to active it in your beta profile?
---
Don't even worry about it. Play the one you feel like at the start, if you get bored at 30, just try something else.
---
Unless you're trying to get world first or something, just play the game one day at a time, don't worry about picking the wrong class.
---
Yeah. They fixed it some patch in Classic, anyways. I just remember this specifically because we walljumped up into unfinished Hyjal. We went to jump off of this ledge that went into Felwood. Warrior lived, I died.
---
That's why you should have such expensive habits and save a lot! :)
---
Aw man, I actually thought mages are one of the most fun classes to level.
---
So I'd definitely agree with you - with mages, you'll probably know early on (maybe level 30'ish) if you'll enjoy the class or not. If you don't like it by then, I doubt you'll like it later on. Other classes need a lot more patience to find out.
---
So when I made a reply that mentioned private servers, my whole thread got shut down. So how exactly are you able to post this without getting in trouble? The rules to this thread don‚Äôt seem consistent.
---
too fucking perfect, i cant wait to go stv now
---
thanks for the response. i'm sorry for your pain lol.
---
So in a beta where things are meant to be tested....
---
You post a bug that obviously should not be happening, and try to use it as something against Layering?
---
Please stop posting.
---
You can downvote me, but this is why I'm going to roll on a streamer server. Streamers always make huge PvP events like this and it's really fun.
---
&gt; they didn't have an item and quest database
---
Thottbot launched 2004.
---
Yeah, it seems like the layering functionality is there, but maybe its just not operating 100% as intended. There are already a handful of incidents clipped from twitch, most of the times killing the person. Heres my theory...
---
So, you know the glass of water metaphor people have used? 1 Cup(layer) gets full (say 2000 people) and a new cup is added to the equation for new players. But, they wouldn't simply start a new layer with nobody in it right? You would be in a ghost town until hours pass and that second layer is filled.
---
...So, maybe when new layers are added, they have to redistribute the population a bit, so theres not Massive layer A and Ghost town layer B. So it goes like this... 6PM, only Layer 1, at 1000 players, 50% capacity. 8 PM: Layer 1 hits 2000 players, 100% capacity, Layer B opens up. There is a phase-shift for 50% of people on Layer A, as each layer gets 1000 people, at 50% capacity now, and they both fill from there, until Layer 3 is needed, and rinse/repeat.
---
sounds like something a softie would say
---
I find DPS the most stressful. If I pull threat its my fault and the tank wants to kick me. If I need heals for standing in bad its my fault and the healer wants to kick me. If I do poor DPS the other DPS wonder why they are carrying me and want to kick me.
---
You'll have good people you run with and bad people you run with. If you love Warrior and Priest I say go for it. You'll spend less time waiting for groups to form and most will bare with your mistakes as you gain your footing. Without LFG tools 9 times out of 10 kicking a person(or them leaving) means its a 4 man dungeon for the rest of the run.
---
In Vanilla I rolled mage. I never blamed the warrior for losing aggro or the Healer for not keeping me up. I even recall more than once being told to stop being a knuckle head(chain blizzarding or starting DPS to early) by the Warrior. ST focus after 2 sunders was what I learned to do.
---
I played Mage since BC. I have a feeling that is when they got more fun.
---
You can still have players grief you by stealing mobs, which makes up most of the grind from what I've seen.
---
Nips out baby!
---
That's what I was thinking.  It's almost like this is a beta test or something
---
Same!
---
As someone who got disconnected several times because of this I can assure you it was a real thing. This was mostly after reset with rare items when you thought somebody with them would have logged in already but actually hadn't. It was double fun when after dcing you thought you were trying to link a different item but it was actually the same item.
---
Since i didn't play back then i can't say i grinded,BUT i remember first time playing on nostalrius,I dinged in that cave in burning stepes with the black dragon after doing a full quest run of BRD :D
---
I am so glad I am alone at work because I was howling.
---
That just looked like 1 mob despawned not layered
---
Yeah farming gold on warrior sucks so much
---
Also the border between Loch Modan and The Badlands. I have so many memories of going down to Uldaman and a 5-man Horde group appearing out of nothing.
---
Ah I misread what intricacyblack wanted tested.  
---
I have found a few things while searching for answers myself:
---
* Wolfshead Helm -&gt; effect does stack with furor.  It is regarded as a BiS in TBC there are people talking about how much faster you can put out 4 point finishers as early as Jan 2008. 
---
* MCP -&gt; If it's haste buff doesn't work then the feral attack formula would be missing haste modifiers entirely.
---
* +Weapon Damage stats -&gt; AQ patch is where discussions started popping up on how it does work for feral when on armor (Might of Cenarius ring).  Patch 2.4 notes : weight and sharpening stones will work while shapeshifted.  It is NOT noted if this was bugged in the previous patch or never worked.
---
This was done partly with Aspect of the Cheetah, or you could just run normally. But you couldn't slow him. He just wasn't very fast and the 'long' corridors made for some easy kiting.
---
this is fucking legend.. wait for it..... dairy -  legendary.
---
"If you're coming from retail, if you've never played vanilla, if you've never played a private server there's a very crucial difference that not a lot of people seem to be touching on"
---
It's the very first paragraph of the post. That's the exact group he's directing it towards.
---
Oh! Well, I never played a druid. I'm ignorant :(
---
No, I'm just giving a better answer than yours to the question you posed.
---
Their aesthetics are pretty cool though - classic paladin armors (and weapons I guess). But generally, not my favorite class either for sure
---
It will help me keep up on my consumables and stuff. I usually play intoxicated so easy mode is most fun.
---
I remember during other betas I have participated in the official line was, "if you are not sure if it is a bug, assume it is and report it."
---
Some people are getting pretty salty about not being on the beta. I get it, because *I* am salty about not being on the beta =P
---
They never updated the stats, the level 60 blues and level 58 blues are different items.
---
This is not vanilla wow. And layering will still be removed. You're probably one of those guys who complain that better textures will ruin the game. Fun fact: classic WoW will never be a makeshift time travel machine, and you will never be 14 or 20, or whatever was your age back in 2004-2006
---
Not that i'm uninterested in this response (because I'm primarily leaning towards starting a Druid first on release), but this may not get a lot of attention only because this thread is supposed to be specific to Shaman related discussion/questions.
---
This happens on LH too. Has nothing to with sharding.
---
My only theory, if this isn't a goof, is that a new layer got added to the game. They didnt want the new layer to be a ghost town, and the original one to be massive, so they redistributed the people. So here, Layer B opens, and defcamp got shifted to that layer B. And now, both are at half capacity instead of before, where Layer A was hitting it's cap.
---
I understand. I just think some content creators (both video and written ones) talk about how great warrior is at 60 in raiding as both a DPS and Tank and don't touch on how slow it is enough (though it is usually mentioned). I feel like a lot of people look at the destination rather than the journey.
---
Sweet thanks for the advice! I looked for guides and couldn't find any but I'll keep looking, I'm sure there are multiple!!!
---
I think I might just roll prot and when I'm done I can go arms and delete people (:
---
1 mob despawned in the same instance 2 more spawned?
---
That is not how layering works.
---
Lmfaooooooo people are so god damn stupid man.
---
I had this happen last night In The undead starting area. To me it looked like the mob was underground and trying to get up. Would pop up and then fall right back down. 
---
Nothing else around me was impacted.
---
Oh no, I might have to start playing again
---
Mists had plenty of problems but the end raids were the absolute best of any expansion imo, especially throne of thunder. Lots of good memories in there.
---
Ah... Bros...... Server 4... Layer 7... Shard 11... Asmongold Group 2....
---
Holy shit I love Esfand but I can't unsee this now
---
Been playing since December 04 I've gotten in like 1 beta feelsbadman
---
This definitely happens on private servers too, for what it's worth.
---
Ya, I have memories of these things happening in Vanilla. Unsure of why but my best guess is that certain zones are on different virtual servers. Actually thats pretty much assured as when AQ gates opened, that zone would crash but not the world server. They "seamlessly" link these servers but sometimes wonky shit happens.
---
No you
---
And now, M+ is like the only entertaining thing in the game for me. Everything else is just... easy, calculated, and fucking boring.
---
AH farming + mining/herbing. All of those mob farming tricks were unviable.     
---
also naked /dance as a dwarf in IF was good money.
---
Wall jumping is not a "core feature" it's a side product of players bugging the game. The game doesn't point to you and say hey you could do this chain of quests to get neutral with these bear guys to let you through their cave or you can make these convoluted jumps around Felwood to get into Winterspring. Take for instance the NPC you can mind control that's just outside MC that gives a great fire resistance buff. That wasn't unintentional, that was planned. 
---
Wall jumping into IF Airport, Quel'danas, Hidden Troll Village, Wetlands Farms, SW Waterfall, STV Tiger Cave, Hyjal or the grand daddy of every glitcher/ exploiter, wall jumping so high up into Teldrassil and rocket boots slowfall into GM Island. All of these areas were made for site seeing while on a FP (with the exception of Hyjal, that was an area planned and canceled).
---
Game devs don't make a game looking for ways to have us break it to access these little nooks and crannies, getting in front of the banker or Auctioneer in any city is annoying as shit for players and isn't a core feature, it's a deliberate player inconveniencing another player for a simple task, right clicking an NPC to get to your goods. You won't see on a game box "hey play our game where you can kill and loot shit but also beat the system to get to areas originally un accessible to the player, break our game"!
---
Don't get me wrong, yes I am berating the ever loving shit out of you like the dick head on the internet that I am only because you've stated it's a "core gameplay", it's not. I however do share your loss. I have old pictures of all those exploit spots on my old desktop and I did have a sense of pride of being in Hyjal and seeing the construction sign or the HUGE ass skeleton of an event I got to play in WC3 and the lore significance of that place. But to say wall jumping is core gameplay, that's a joke.
---
I can see T-shirts and stickers being made "I just got Layered bro"
---
I mean, these things are generally not WA exclusive anyway.
---
If you couldn't make a WA to see enemy CDs you could use any other addon like gladiatorlossa which would tell you when they use cds.
---
WA is just a very convenient way to do everything under one addon.
---
Hey guys, this is me.
---
I want to say that I am pretty sure this is Sharding. The Beta only has two servers (one PvE and one PvP) so with as many people that got in the last two days, I think Sharding is necessary to keep things from getting unstable.
---
Isn't there this one BIS druid item that dramatically reduces the mana cost of shapeshifting? Far as I remember people only relatively recently found out its actually pretty damn amazing/BIS.
---
Soo untrue. Go on LH and see for yourself,bit happens there too. Quit lieing to look cool
---
Thanks for this, I have no idea why, but as I lay in bed last night, free associating, I remembered questing in E/W Plaguelands with my water elemental and wondered: "Will my water elemental be in wow classic?" 
---
Well, now I know. No research at all required. :)
---
I think the consensus is that it does _not_ show up on the website only in the client.
---
Monkeynews is considered one of the best Vanilla players, but he only plays Warrior. He's part of one of the best/most hardcore guilds called "APES" and hes done the Rank 14 grind 3 or 4 times I think, while also done all content on each big private server release. Genuine guy which is very good at the game but doesn't come off as elitist and a douchebag.
---
Pretty sure a lot of us have already expected that.
---
If it doesn‚Äôt act  exactly how ion described it would, I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs a bug. He didn‚Äôt join a group so he shouldn‚Äôt have changed layers.
---
BC came out in 2007..that's a lot of time that has passed for people to change what they want. Nobody really knows what caused Blizz to go the classic route, but we do know that along with Nost came a large increase in requests for a Blizzard Vanilla. I can imagine a world without Nost where Blizz simply never creates an official Classic server, because it's not on anybody's radar.
---
Everybody please pick skinning and herb.
---
Its the best gold making
---
*picks mining and enchanting*
---
This isn't anything new. Back in vanilla they would release a batch of new servers every few weeks/months. On each server people would race to be the first to 60, then the first to 60 on each race/class. Some people would just keep rerolling each time a new server got released to start the race over gain. Some people just enjoy the competition even if it is pointless.
---
Didn't see "No changes by the way :) :) :)" that part.
---
Thank you. This is the most accurate and helpful post for people who aren‚Äôt insane. There is so much awesome shit in Vanilla before you get to end game. Some of the early dungeons are the best (looking at you Deadmines, SFK).  Enjoy the leveling damnit.
---
Hard to say. The stun is nice, but it's almost impossible to give up the Orc stun resist if you're serious about grinding high levels in PvP.  I feel like shaman mobility is already weak, and there's next to no escape mechanic outside of earthbind/frost shock slowing, so chain CC is almost guaranteed death. Being able to resist CC and kill off the other party before they kill you seems more reliable, even though it's an RNG mechanic.
---
I'm not an expert though, so this could be completely wrong.
---
From these different clips being posted it seems the Beta still has some sort of broken sharding going on. All of these clips are after servers restarted. Blizzard testing stuff.
---
Hopefully I won‚Äôt be on a streamers server but honestly I don‚Äôt care what they do.
---
I think frost might blow up, but I can't think of anyone beyond him.

FYI i'm all for the mega difficulties, just an afterthought after watching Kargoz latest stream. It looked as if all his working that had gone into making these speed run guides was for nothing after finding out how different it was for warlocks.
---
does no one remember the invisible wall around uldaman?  So many pvp battles with people popping in and out.
---
Same boat here. No kids but adulting still doesn't jive with more devoted raiding. someone please start a guild (or 100) for people in this situation.
---
Both 169k viewers?
---
Seems like a reasonable theory. I hate it.
---
I'd much rather be in a group with 6 other people if I get the unlucky B shard than I would be phased out of my own at any point while I am logged in (aside from joining a group, etc.).
---
oh weird, tf. I haven't seen it happen to any of the streamers I've watched. guess it's just a coincidence so far
---
&gt; They didnt want the new layer to be a ghost town, and the original one to be massive, so they redistributed the people.
---
That's exactly what's not supposed to happen. They clearly said you don't change your layer unless you get into a group (or switch guilds). The entire point of layering instead of sharding is a continuous world where you see the same people, because people don't want to phase around.
---
I'm not ignoring anything, I'm saying that each decision was made by blizzard in large. If blizzard disagrees with public opinion then give us a detailed writeup / forum post saying why they believe their stance is superior.
---
Here is a good example from my all time favorite game: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/bjmndc/an_update_from_chris/
---
Path of exile's lead designer and co-creator posted this on reddit in response to a few of the communities backlashes, he holds his ground on some subjects and continues to explain why they do the things they do, they give a good reason for their stance and they don't spit in the players faces while doing it.
---
Here is another link of their Developer Q&amp;A's that happened not to long ago:
---
- Part 1: https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2498351
---
- Part 2: https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2500872/page/1
---
They hit all the hard questions that the community currently has, they even disagree with the biggest community dispute with regards to Trading in the ARPG. But they're not disrespectful and don't come off as pricks like Allen did when he said the famous "you think you do but you dont".
---
I believe wholeheartedly that the developers are 100% to blame for a bad game because they've got the ability to sort through the good and bad and pick which is of high quality suggestions and which aren't. Which will help the game, and which won't. In Blizzards case, yes they had an outcry to make the game easier and they caved, they made it easier for all forms of life, now it is clear (has been clear for a while, but to the mass public it is NOW clear) that their game was a failure because of the handicaps they put in their game, the titanforging as a use to make bad players feel good and good players feel bad was the most recent fuck up imo.
---
Game devs have the ultimate ability to decipher comments made by the community and pick and choose between which they want to implement into their game. Blizzard chose to cater to noobs who didn't understand their game, and now they reap what they sowed.
---
You're right I misread what happened exactly
---
Mage -&gt; blink
---
Agreed, they'll also bring in many retail noobs that's just free honor lmao.
---
The tokens don't add any gold to the economy, they are actually a small gold drain since there's a AH cut. It's worse when players get their accounts hacked and then restored. That effectively duplicates that player's gold which is very bad for the economy.
---
you don't need to be a subscriber to gain access, but you need an active subscription to be able to play if you gain access
---
This exact thing happens on private servers. It has nothing to do with sharding
---
I dont think we are going to see like any accounts for sale. The first reason is that the people posting threads to buy them are offering WAYYYYYYY too much money (I have seen 400-600$ being offered from buyers). The second reason is, the people that are getting in actually want to play, Blizzard is seemingly choosing pretty well who they invite. The third reason is that they would have to sell (or rent?) their accounts which many dont want to risk getting banned for TOS violation.
---
I did right after the announcement
---
... how?
---
I believe so. Things like that, Wolfshead with the +20 energy, and Manual Crowd Pummeler make druid a fun time. But without those items, they feel naked.
---
This too will pass.
---
Raderio is kind of horse shit, imo. Takes a while to build up, and it really hurts newer characters and players. Creates even *another* layer of elitism on top of the existing ones that have already rampaged through the game. 
---
I remember when we used to actually help people figure out what to do. You got the gear for this? Cool. Do X Y Z during A B C and we'll cc these raid marks and you'll look out for D E F ape mechanics and for second phase... 
---
Now it's just "link to the achievements you paid people to carry you through, and make sure to have q ridiculous raiderio if you even want to attempt to wipe this instance with the most elite douche bags you've ever seen stand in fire." It's kind of heartbreaking. 
---
On paper, I love raiderio. In reality, it's shite.
---
Misdirection was added in TBC friend
---
This is the best one ive seen
---
This happened in Vanilla. I remember the spots where it hits - check the minimap. 20 bucks says it's between 2 geofences (zone border).
---
This didn't happen at all geofences, iirc, but this spot was one of them, I recall.
---
Private server hipster over here xD 
---
We should be thanking 2004 Blizzard for creating vanilla in the first place. No, thank the developer's mothers for giving birth to them. NO, thank Ra the Sun God for allowing the creation of civilization...
---
I get that... but whats the alternative of being in Layer 2 at first? You would literally have the world to yourself, and thats even more strange. There has to be a way to combat that, right?
---
True lol
---
His streams back during Nost days were amazing, can't wait for him to start streaming again
---
Or if you log off
---
People actually subbed for a shot at the vanilla  beta?
---
I'm so hype to run WC now
---
Its still wild to me that blizzard took a joke that existed as like three little Easter and made it into an entire expansion. One of the better expansions too.
---
Again, I agree, but how is that **not** mutually exclusive with being elitist/gatekeeping?
---
By saying this scenario is **not** mutually exclusive, it means that there is a group of people who are *both* elitists/gatekeepers when to comes to raid selection *and* who prioritize social interaction when selecting raids.  So to avoid any further confusion, just answer this question; are you gearing up the ret pally or not?
---
It's always been strange to me that wow fans consider Legion one of the best xpacs ever yet BFA is widely considered one of the worst, when their mechanics are really similar.
---
Legion was quite awful, the systems were just fresh for a short while
---
Nerding out in the middle of the night is more fun than during daytime anyway (not even kidding)
---
He‚Äôs implying that it‚Äôs not really the WoW:BFA category it‚Äôs the WoW:classic category because the majority of the viewers are watching classic bet streams.
---
You jumped from: New gameplay mechanic is potentially harmful &gt;&gt;&gt; I bet you rage at colorblind mode. And then you go on a nostalgia high horse trip, like that has anything to do with their comment, and try to dismiss them with CrAzY lEtTeRs.
---
No. You are assigned a permanent layer.
---
If you see "PeonTheRug", the resident UR Rogue on your layer, you will see him in the world upon bumping into him later on down the line.
---
Layer assignments are semi-permanent and only change under 2 conditions:
---
-Layer Merge
---
-Party
---
This is just fundamentally incorrect.
---
**I want to say right now i do NOT want tokens in Classic**
---
Tokens arent fiat currency, though.  They dont magically create gold out of nowhere, they actually do the opposite iirc (i believe theres a slight 'cut' on the gold - like the AH cut, which effectively gets destroyed, though i *might* be mixing that up with something else).  Even without that cut though, it wont cause inflation.  The person that gets the gold from selling the token is receiving it from another player that had to farm the gold.  The gold isnt magically coming out of thin air...it was already in the economy.
---
Selling a token on retail is effectively the same as lucking into a very nice epic drop.  Yep, youre going to get a nice fat sum of gold for it, but that gold isnt magically being put into the economy, someone else had to farm the gold in the first place to buy your item.  Even if they bought a token to sell, and then bought the item from you...the person that bought the token from them had to farm the gold.
---
Items on modern wow are expensive as fuck because of the amount of 'free gold' that blizzard handed out in the past, mostly from garrisons/order hall mission tables.  Without something like that in classic, theres flat out nothing generating that kind of gold to put into the economy.  People have to get their gold from questing (finite amount of quests per toon), killing things and looting their gold/vendoring junk, etc.
---
the is no classic section.. it would be 160k classic and 9k BFA and only because josh got no beta invite
---
Can't wait to use the report player function to report everyone who is ganking me in STV :)
---
You can argue that some of the best things in WoW wouldn't have seen light of day or wouldn't have even crossed Blizzards mind without the input of the community.
---
Its a doubled edged blade, and Blizzard needs to understand how to sift through the comments and perceptions and apply changes where they are needed based on more than "game to hard pls nerf".
---
softie lmaoo, bet you are sub 1500 arena rating and couldn't compete in raiding
---
I personally assume that the glass of water metaphor is completely off. There's no reason to fill a layer until it's maxed before opening a new one.
---
In this system, one server is in fact as big as many old servers, and one layer is as big as a single old server. Based on the pop, people could already be spread across multiple layers before the first is full. That would simulate the old classic population (otherwise at least one layer would always be full, even if at that time a normal server would nearly be empty) and avoid most "empty layer" issues.
---
What you see in this screenshot happens in high end M+ all the time
---
Pretty sure they said it is only consistent upon play session. Meaning next time you log back on you will be in a different layer.
---
You start a streamer incubator, duh
---
Literally as soon as any streamer starts doing Azuregos or Kazzak (or any of the other world dragons) they're going to get raided.
---
I think people forgot that even a single death to a main raider (tank or healer especially) resulted in sitting around until the debuff wore off.
---
Definitely the mage, conjuring water to everyone, buffing, drinking, spamming one button.. definitely not my type of class.
---
Who tf is josh
---
I'm not arguing against that.
---
Im arguing that this guy makes this post to be negative when this is more than likely a beta/bug.
---
Could this happen in retail? Yeah, but obviously this isn't the intention.
---
This is more min max pserver nonsense. Our ot was an arms warrior well into aq along with several of our dps warriors (we didn‚Äôt run 9 either we only ran 5 and we also ran well over the ‚Äúviable‚Äù number of 2 hunters per raid) 
---
The day our guild killed nefarian for the first time (with an oomkin dpser no less) the guild ahead of us killed him with a bear Druid tank.
---
Incidentally, the guild ahead of them (the top guild on our sever) poached our prot pally (we ran a prot pally in raids) to tank in naxx.
---
Our server was small but close knit, so I imagine most servers at least had some small group of players similar to ours, just based on large numbers.
---
Everything you have said so far is wrong, and the min max pserver sensibility needs to stop now. Especially since many of the pserver babies have been exposed as big fat phonies.
---
You'd actually be surprised how much threat you can generate with consecrate, ret aura, and even tab judging; when paired with righteous fury of course
---
Pfft 60 my ass. All a warrior needs is intercept, pummel, and execute.
---
I guess it‚Äôs different for me. When you push higher mythic +‚Äôs you have to communicate and I remember someone I‚Äôve done a key with. 
---
Those moments you are looking for are located in a different place now, but they still exist. 
---
My issue is to say flat out that the game sucks, you can‚Äôt make friends etc. it‚Äôs just lazy and unproductive criticism. Complaining about BFA being too easy and refuse to actually try and complete the difficult content is just a clear example of manifesting your own narrative - it‚Äôs just very dogmatic to exclude portions of a game to criticize it.
---
I'm pretty sure I saw a video where this was an option.  I think Blizzard said everyone in vanilla used Grid anyway so they left this in.
---
Yup, I hit 60 as an undead mage running scholomance. Even got the caster dagger off the final boss as a trophy.
---
At least one more time
---
Tanks are in such demand that nobody will hold being a beginner against you. Just be honest with people and communicate with your group. You don't necessarily have to take all feedback your group mates give, as some people are idiots, but at least listen.
---
I don't know about that one. It could easily just be a poor choice of wording on a sentence that emphasizes point one, as opposed to being it's own important point.   
---
If you remove the word 'currently' from the sentence then it's doesn't come off the same way. The fact that the interpretation hinges on that single word which has to be extrapolated to imply "If you didn't sub before the beta your screwed" makes me hesitant to assume the worst.  
---
Maybe I'm just being delusional, but I'm taking this as him saying: "1. Yes, you need to have a sub." and just to be crystal clear, because your the 5 millionth person to ask me today, "2. That means if you don't have a sub you won't get in future waves".
---
Me too! Hi friend
---
Can anyone confirm if layering is even on the Beta? They might've just done a force respawn of all the mobs or something.
---
Appreciate the reply, brotha
---
You are right, are different items so... I wish they introduce this items before then 60 items.
---
As far as I'm concerned, Classic WoW was confirmed the moment Blizzard invited the Nostalrius team to Irvine to talk with them.
---
Problem is when the impatient people start pulling on their own *looking at you Russian mages &gt;_&lt;*
---
Most of the game world has been reworked and redone with all the expansions since classic. Some people prefer it, most people here don't. Character classes have also changed significantly, some classes are really bad at doing certain things unlike retail where everything can generally do well enough comparatively speaking. You can definitely player "weaker" specs though, most people won't really care. Certain races can't play certain classes due to lore/limited development time. The leveling experience is a lot more involved and time consuming than it is on retail. Modern retail WoW also has features like automatically finding people to do dungeons/raids with, while classic does not. You also have to travel to the dungeon/raid if you wish to do it most of the time. Retail will just teleport you to the dungeon after the party is formed. End game raiding is also different, there's a lot more gathering of resources, crafting, and preparation in general.
---
And I‚Äôm perfectly fine raid healing. PvP is just way more fun when you can do the killing. I‚Äôve read up on the spec. Seems like 30/0/21 will do just fine in raids. Until AQ40 and Naxx. Worried if I ever want to see those I‚Äôll have to go full Resto. Which will cause frequent respecs. Can‚Äôt seem to find much on how to farm gold as a shaman. I‚Äôll likely go herbalism and engineering for professions. Maybe mining instead? Not entirely sure yet
---
You raise a good point. Though I wonder if they anticipate a full 9k (3 3k servers) for every individual server, and just open up 3 layers to start.
---
Well Most dont care if Money is enough. But I am Curious  about new Wave. So many New people popping :-(
---
My first char was a Mage. I never managed to main one until Legion. Just couldn't do em
---
You're forgetting Blessing of Salvation on the Mage (who is angry at you for not giving them BoW) because their AoE is enough to pull some of the mobs off you.
---
You can't socialize with anti-social people by definition, if you get your dick hard by making the game worse for others, I'd argue that is a symbol of anti-social behavior and thus you can't really socialize with him.
---
&gt; are you gearing up the ret pally or not?
---
Why would I want to play with someone who only wants to play with me to make the game worse for me?
---
Well yes. But if you are in a guild and you are not the only one in the guild online a relogg will not change your layer.
---
Oh god second that pulling the pat one. I love it when people rage at you for not skipping every single skippable pull only to wipe when somebody asspulls a group.
---
Blizz would never tacitly endorse pservers. It's against their legal and economic interests.
---
This is what people like /u/gaben38 need to get through their head.
---
We are *putting up with it*
---
That is why I've put disclaimers here and on the tool that its based on 2.4.0 and could be horribly wrong.
---
If you also take a look at the tool there's option for "classic" to control intelligence based mana regeneration, ie. switch on "classic" it will ignore intelligence.
---
Also my point was more to give people a reference, not exact calculations and values, also if you play with a tool for a bit you will notice that in 2.4.0 the regeneration is higher than in the formulas or current classic beta, however its off by 2-5 hp / tick in early levels at least for warriors and rogues that I've been gathering data up on atm.
---
That is my point, I want a 58-59 twink like my old days, I spend a lot of time in my twink and I really want a similar experience again.
---
Same here!!! Just restarted launcher and its there.
---
Human Paladin, Dwarf Priest, and Gnome Warlock.
---
What's with streamers and saying "boys"
---
Well that was my first point, people are paying way more than the average person ever would so we wont see them listed for sale because they will just sell to those posting buy offers for 500ish dollars
---
Yeah, for about a month until people realize Cliassic WoW sucked.
---
You could use scripts back in the day for that, I did at least
---
You could play BFA
---
&gt; I AM tempted to power level up a rogue and get engineering for sapper charges and sabotage all the try-hard raiders and ruin their world buffs, so maybe i'll do that if I get salty enough.
---
If you have decent daggers, just do an Ambush spec to gank healers or clothies. You only need to blow them up and get the hell out.
---
I mained Pally back in Vanilla... it was brutal.. I quit/took long breaks because of how unbearable it was. Hence why I'm going Priest this time I think plus my friends want to go Horde so I don't even have the option.
---
True. But as someone who has never played classic I see it as a good opportunity to learn. Also maybe since I‚Äôve never really played before I might still have fun when classic is released. I think I won‚Äôt go too hard just play it off and on. Get to level 30 maybe. That way I know what I‚Äôm doing and I will still have 30 levels of shit I haven‚Äôt done.
---
Ive played since November 04, played all xpaxs, resubbed on Wednesday, got an invite Thursday. For what it‚Äôs worth, that‚Äôs my story
---
Classic launches Aug 27? 
---
They are missing the boat not making it early summer so people can basement dwell all summer.
---
Dude it was just a memejoke though bro right
---
Method josh
---
Rest assured, 1.12 had a global no cap lookingforgroup channel. Pugs will flourish.
---
His totems also despawned
---
I said I dont wanna do this because its pointless. Good day sir.
---
And Uldaman. And LBRS. And Strath.
---
God I miss vanilla.
---
It was hyperbole homie. If horde can do it you pansies can figure something out too. And don't you dare say tremor totem lol.
---
&gt;  so to narrow it down they are inviting Vanilla players who are still actively subbed.
---
I'd say having to actively go update your beta preferences for classic narrows it down plenty
---
If you mean N*stalrius, it's because of the performance hacks they implemented.
---
Because he is playing a mage, and alliance mages are way better than horde mages.
---
On horde, you don't have salvation buffs (pala threat reduction) and you are sure as shit not getting a shaman in your group (as they are reserved fo rmelees) so anyone who wants to play Mage/warlock should roll alliance, and all rogues/warriors should be horde.
---
Being able to reserve character names could actually be an incredibly valuable tactic by Blizzard to judge server population sizes. Maybe they can use that info to adjust the initial value? I hope they actually have 10 times the layers for the first week and collide them into like 3 after that, but who knows.
---
Except you are not assigned to a random faction and then decide what class to play. If people want to play shaman they will pick horde. Are shamans/paladins underrepresented in polls? yes. half as much? no way lol.
---
Kargoz has without a doubt the highest quality content.
---
Zones can be sharded on N*stcore to improve performance.
---
It does but not enough
---
I'd give warlocks some kind of threat reducing ability, maybe feint and make it ranged. Soulshatter is TBC unfortunately. Also I'd move ignite to priests just to fuck with the mages a bit hehehe.
---
Who knew Tupac played WoW.
---
Ofc love me some gambling and spinning the slot machine
---
Charging people for a chance to get into the beta is different than requiring a current subscription for a chance to get into the beta. This isn't a private server where you just get stuff for free haha.
---
It'll die once the nostalgia hit fades.
---
Just buy gold from gold farmers and problem solved.
---
Actually, the WoW Token is the only thing that kept retail's economy from being destroyed by gold sellers.
---
The gold wasn't necessarily in the economy. Multiple people met gold cap in vanilla WoW, the extra gold being funneled into the economy through gold sinks would artificially inflate it.
---
Who dat and why he relevant
---
&gt;supporting layering was antithetical to supporting vanilla wow. 
---
Well I mean you should, as you are being extremely ignorant and I wouldn't want you making my community toxic either.  I don't know of anyone that actually supports it, rather just is accepting that it's going to be needed because the alternatives are way worse.
---
You dont need a guild to find a raid group either. But it certainly helps
---
I always played horde, undead priest looks best in armor
---
Bwl is where the better hit gear is which scales better for dw fury.  Typically around end of bwl is where warz pass rogues.
---
Sorry, I meant to phrase my response in a way that was saying 30/21 should be exactly what you're looking for.
---
From what I've read and researched, the only time you really "need" to go deep/full resto is if you're MT healing specifically, and/or in a very hardcore min/max raiding guild.
---
&gt; 2 druids are 59 and 26 lvl.
---
This is key here, by having a 59 in the group they're lowering the overall xp gain.
---
yall right completely forgot about that.
---
Only the tokens will increase in value.
---
Literally any caster.
---
Your plan is solid but I highly highly encourage you to roll warrior if you want to tank. Paladins  will generally not be accepted as tanks any time a warrior is available.
---
Because Perplexity (The rogue) is a very active PvP'er and throughout most of his Youtube videos you'll see him pulling insane shit off in PvP, which you rarely see. I don't want to dick ride, but his content is mostly based off him doing shit you'll be impressed about and knowing mechanics like this is part of what makes him so good at the game, so he wants to test stuff like this, so he can continue creating content which 'uses' stuff like this. It's his expertise, in my opinion. While other players just want to play the game on their level of knowledge.
---
For me it was eastern plaguelands. I spent about two days going from 58 to 60 on my hunter grinding undead around a zigguraut.
---
Hmmmm.
---
This is also tempting.
---
S key best key.
---
I first heard Sco using it years ago on his stream and I can only assume others are copying his use of it as if they are some sort of defacto leader /shrug
---
I thought linking items in chat came way after vanila
---
Testing the rate of experience gain in the dynamic environment is really important. It's easy enough to look up the quantity of experience mobs and quests gave, but when you combine that with spawn rates and travel times and all the random things that can happen, you only get a clear picture over a large sample size (ie lots of levels). Ideally hitting levels by certain /played benchmarks should be similar to or slightly faster than original records. That gives the devs good information on the accuracy of the game systems.
---
+3 stamina
---
Equip: increases haste by 300%
---
Ultima online
---
I have no idea if you are right or not but take my upvote, Blizzard should look into it to make sure
---
Am I the only one who really enjoyed WoD?
---
Warrior: charge and heroic leap
---
DH: well, they got glide and double jump
---
Mage: slow fall, ice block, blink
---
Priest: levitate
---
Shaman: ankh. But should that really count? For the sake of it I am not counting it as "avoiding fall damage"
---
Rogue: shadowstep/grappling hook (just like heroic leap) and reduced fall damage
---
Druid: less fall damage in cat form, small leap in travel form if talent selected, reverse life-grip in regular form if talent selected, moonkin got disengage if talent selected, bear got charge if talent selected. Moonkin also got a small glyph that gives them slow fall. Best to google "flap moonkin glyph" since it looks so funny.
---
Warlock: none
---
hunter: disengage
---
paladin: bubble
---
monk: none
---
dk: none
---
8 out of 12 of all classes have abilities to avoid fall damage. Druids can only avoid fall damage completely if they choose the talent Wild Charge, which is chosen 99% of the time anyway. To add to that, ankh for shamans does not really count as "avoiding fall damage" if we are being honest. That's 7 out of 12 classes that **can** avoid fall damage, no matter which talents they choose and provided the spells aren't on CD. Out of those 8, there is one class where two specializations can't avoid fall damage if they have no target: assassination and sub rogues.
---
In the end it looks like this: 
---
8 classes can negate fall damage completely, if the spell is not in CD, they have a target in reach and the necessary talent selected.
---
7 of those 8 can do it at all times, provided the spell is not on CD and they have a target in reach.
---
6 1/3 of those 7 can do it without the need of having a target in reach and if the spell is not on CD.
---
3/4 years. I'm stoked to return.
---
It's not, but I'd say I'm pretty fluent, what is it you don't understand?
---
Those are all wide dungeons, but they don't really have a lot of backtracking. Provided you keep moving, you'll get to the end. Places like BRD can legit lead you into a dead end if you're going at them blind, hence why I didn't list those you mentioned.
---
Although they *are* fantastic dungeons.
---
December 2004 account, subbed off and on over the years. Was subbed recently. Invited Thursday.
---
lmao np, I was sarcastically replying 'yes' but I suppose it didn't come off to well
---
Okay cool thank you :) I was thinking that font looked like it belongs more in World of Starcraft haha
---
Bunch of dudes in dresses. Nothing to see here. Move along.
---
But I'm the exact same places? Like the crocs in durotar/barrens river. Same happened on beta and in nost core
---
I appreciate the support. Been busy all day login on and off on battlenet. No luck so far.   
---
Maybe I'll get the stress test.
---
They said they're adding other PvP items that were added in different patches into their respective phases, so there's precedent to believe they might do the same with R10 blues.
---
Absorb doesnt absorb fall damage :(
---
Several of my friends subbed just for the beta, none of them have gotten it.
---
probably takes a part, but people are also gaining access with never playing in vanilla - also seems more weighted too US from what ive seen, could just be because there are more US streamers.
---
Wait. Isn't there an obvious bug here?? I distinctly remember that people in your raid, but not your group were flagged in arena.
---
We don't need a post of every single thing anyone does in Beta.
---
I bet they could get some kind of useful info from the name reserves, but whos to know what % of people will do that? I think thats really hard to bank too much on.
---
As far as your layer hopes, I kind of agree with that... however, I think 9 layers for a whole week is extreme. It makes sense to have that many on day one, when there is that initial zerg... but after day 1, 3 layers should be enough to make the game \*playable\*. It still won't be a peaceful place, but it's still an MMO on launch week. Plus having 9 layers would seem awfully antithetical for Vanilla, even if it's just for a week. 1 or 2 days, I can totally get behind.
---
I understand, but I disagree. Sure they hold the keys, but the community is toxic when it comes to wanted features. I blame the community far more.
---
I dunno man, I've never owned a Dell, but I'm pretty sure people have leveled both those class/race combos on them before.
---
He's better then tips though. Actually cares about the game.
---
I can confirm. I havent paid $$ for a sub in 6 months.
---
Rune of Metamorphisis in BWL did that but it was an On-use effect.
---
Instead of latching on to others opinions of the current xpac, try it out and form your own. Everyone is different. You might actually like it.
---
You're out of control
---
I kinda agree I liked the idea of it though like a frost pet to travel with and aid you but I felt like it could of been executed better.
---
Good suggestions so far. I‚Äôm going the throw plantinum wow in there too. Great editing skills
---
Because it's between zone borders.
---
Yea I noticed this while testing, I'll probably make the 16:9 a little better later on.  
---
I just used the editor itself that comes with wallpaper engine and some paint.net magic.
---
Here‚Äôs a tip - heal instead of shocking when netted. That wasn‚Äôt layering that killed you. Git gud nerd.
---
I mean, what does that suggest?
---
RPPVP can wait until phase 3 or 4 like vanilla.
---
I'd say I'd ask for your money back from whoever taught you.
---
Depending on the situation, Stealth is like one of the top 3 broken abilities in vanilla along and pally bubble and either blessing of freedom or WF depending on faction.
---
To really compare stuff like this you should look at:
---
1. Same patch level
---
2. Same group size
---
3. Same levels in the group (or as close as you can get).
---
Everything else leaves to many variables in so you can really make conclusions.
---
enchanting gold making?
---
On the one hand, yes, everyone should play how they choose.
---
What I think the OP is intending, though, is to let newer players know that they actually DO have a choice. For so long, the game and the community has emphasized the endgame to the point that the leveling experience is an inconvenience to be burned as quickly as possible rather than an opportunity to be savored.
---
Blasting straight to 60 is AN option, but it‚Äôs not the ONLY option.
---
Not hard to have to do when you were born in private servers
---
Why wouldn't I say Tremor Totem ?
---
I never understand this POV. Some people like to level fast/gear up fast. Some people like to take their time. Why is it hard for people to accept that? ‚ÄúEnjoying it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to mean taking your time
---
These shitpost are getting out of control.
---
Ok see now this is fucking great
---
Hi, /u/hogaboga
---
yes, yes, yes.
---
I tested this yesterday and did not see phasing happening, its new with the restart
---
LOL! 
---
crossing fingers for you, good luck.
---
I dont know about that. every one I talked to in Dun Morah last night was a sub'd player. But we also where month 1 vanilla players
---
That's right. I reflected it in the formula.
---
I have a friend who is not an influencer who got an invite today. Not sure it's only influencers.
---
...........
---
whomever*
---
Well i know that asmon has a few glad titles under his name. So he is not bad at pvp (to all you elitist out there, no glad is not easy to get whatever expansion it was)
---
 Why are you so insistent on defending Blizzard and this sharding nonesense? 
---
Are you from retail or something?
---
Is this serious? They are getting less xp in the old video because they have a 59 in the group dude. lmao
---
No prob, friend! Glad to see other hopeful Paladins who are unafraid of healing while leveling!
---
Aside from what other people are saying, people will put up with you as you learn because they need you. 
---
Play what you want.
---
This will sound somewhat ignorant on my part but, why is the client a main reason? What's the difference between emulating it on current WoW client and having it on the classic WoW client?
---
People don't sit around and watch amateur football.  Thank you for proving my point.
---
The real question is, can me and my son both play on the same Bnet account? I guess the question is similar to you but a bit different in the fact that we may need to be logged into the same launcher at the same time. Is it possible?
---
I also play toxic as much as I can.
---
Cause, ya know. Front stabbing, and /sit tanking is "authentic"
---
I can't be the only one that took that as "unless you sub you'll be disqualified from further waves" right? That's 100% what I think he meant. With proper grammar he would say "I'm not sure if you're an active subscriber, but if not then you can't gain access in any of the future waves." Or another way "if you ARE an active subscriber you wont be disqualified from future waves"
---
An interesting point of view about the summoning. As a player in vanilla in remember loving this change because I *loved* doing dungeons and wasting time waiting for other people to actually get to the dungeon was really annoying. Especially in vanilla when the world was bigger and travel was slower. Life was literally 'let's go to ironforge to spend an hour putting together a group to go to strat then tack on 15+ minutes for everyone to get there.'
---
Then they added LFG and you could just click a button and instead of waiting in IF and spamming chat for a party it just does it for you! That seemed like such a good change to me.
---
What I've found since then is that people who don't want to put in the effort to go to the dungeon are not very likely to be good party mates and certainly won't be invested in finishing the run if there is a wipe or two.
---
One of my most memorable wow moments was the time I spent literally 6 hours in a single BlackRock Depths run.  We had wipes and party changes and all kinds of mistakes, but I remember that run specifically and you'd better believe we fuckin cleared it. That would simply never happen in retail today.
---
This is not how layering should work anyway, layering doesn't dynamicaly phase people like sharding
---
Hunter / frost mage
---
My advice would be to slow down a bit and take a breath, if you're looking for a guild over friends you're going to likely have to wait awhile.  Most of the groups coming together,the seeds of future raid groups, are going to be groups of friends.  In vanilla the norm wasn't pre-built pro raid teams but guilds that coalesced from smaller groups of friends interacting and leveling together into these larger guilds that could support a 40 man raid team.
---
As someone who played both horde and alliance, and raided with paladins who wished some shaman mail could drop because it was good for healing, and with warriors who wished paladin gear could drop because it was good for fury, trust me, there were several faction exclusive items above and beyond just class set items. Whatever your group thought were paladin/shaman specific items, Blizzard saw them as hybrid items anyone could use.
---
It seems pretty clear this is a bug.
---
Told ya vanilla was hard. 
---
scrub
---
This specific thing is known though
---
Didn't the Nostalrius group get invited to Blizz HQ a while back? I agree they could do better with dispersing info but I don't think they are only focused on talking to streamers.
---
Thank god for NA classic servers, cuz the Russian mages are absolutely this way.
---
Hey, hopefully we get a chance to relive that though, in 3 or so years. Theres been a few comments from developers saying expansions aren't off the table, \*especially\* if Classic is wildly successful.
---
This looks like Sharding tbh, notice how the mobs in durotar aren't there until he crosses the zone border. I'm going to go with what other people are saying, and assume Blizzard are fucking around with some stuff.
---
I heard in multiple streams last night that wall jumping is no longer a thing
---
It's clearly unintentional, this is not how layering is supposed to operate. They had a reset 1 hour ago, so whatever they implemented is not working as intended, hence it being a beta.
---
My favorite was always anal [bleach].
---
Yes!!!
---
Do you mean Vanilla or Nostalrius?
---
&gt; there‚Äôs really nothing better than a Nelf hunter for ease of access to the early zones.
---
Hunters in general were the fastest and strongest levelers.
---
Report them as bugs. It shouldn't be happening, since sharding and phasing are not an intended thing.
---
Layering isn't an acronym.
---
Even asmongold was blatantly wrong about some stuff when I was watching his stream yesterday. Pretty sad
---
Yeah. Why dont they release all raids at the same time aswell honestly. It makes no sense to have server progression and stuff to look forward to
---
Yeah, I'd like some clarification on this. It might just mean that you need to be actively subbed to be considered for future waves, but poorly worded in a way that makes it sound like you're screwed if you haven't been subbed since before the announcement.
---
Or maybe that really is the case and Blizz just wants to punish people for not supporting BFA haha.
---
cry more virgin beta kid
---
Several of the ones I saw showed things that still happened in Vanilla. It isnt sharding or layering its just a quirk of how things worked back then. Can it be fixed now that server tech has come a long way? IDK, maybe.
---
The blue was so good. Basically mtn dew with fruit punch. My friend bought 6 12 packs when wrath of the lich king launched and I think he literally still has an unopened box. Probably toxic by now but now it is just a nostalgia piece.
---
Being a protection paladin is hard.  Its not for the light hearted.  That being said you can tank 5 mans pretty easily as just being holy.  Holy shock to start a fight gives a good amount of threat and it can crit.
---
who cares? guarantee i don't remember everything about every low level instance. Tips has done a lot towards getting classic some great momentum. I like anybody who advocated for classic before classic.
---
I could be wrong, it was a long time ago, but I thought it was mostly a PvP cheat. I thought the idea was that if you deliberately lag spike yourself melee have trouble staying on you, but you can keep doing damage to them.
---
I did not think it did anything at all to PvE mobs, who would stay on you and smack you regardless because they tracked your server-side position.
---
But like I said, I never used one and it was a long time ago, so I could well be wrong.
---
There's nothing better than people not willing to accept that objectively broken addons have existed over the course of WoWs lifespan.
---
My favorite has to be AVR in WoTLK - hands down the single most broken raiding addon in the history of WoW.
---
Do AMAs need answers right away? I mean when he wakes up he will have a whole a bunch of questions to answer which kind of seems better..
---
Sure, but I've not seen any of them test it.
---
Blizzlike? It's literally Blizzard making the game and remaking Classic. The company is Blizzard. It is what they want it to be, it's 100% blizzlike, even if they add sharding. Now if you said it's not like it use to be, well than that's a different argument.
---
Do they love retail more than they love playing games with their friends? Almost everyone started playing wow because their hardcore friends got them into it. The exact same thing will happen with classic wow.
---
Haha yes. I wrote a keyboard macro to spam that button for me. 
---
Put another healer on follow. Someone text me when the raid is over i'll be at the bar.
---
pays to be kind and genuine :) i‚Äôll be looking to make a few brofriends on classic for sure!
---
LMAO
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean it works lol
---
opening up at server with hundreds of characters, potentially a few thousand, at level 60 that will immediately begin their journey to 70 without the natural quantity of characters levels 59 and lower is going to create a server with a stagnant economy and vacuous azeroth.
---
Go for it. Just know you absolutely won't be tanking raids.
---
Nostalrius didn't create Vanilla, no reason to act like we are in their debt. There were giants that moved mountains before Nost was even thought of. You should be thanking Mangos if you're going to thank anyone but blizzard.
---
/decursive anyone?
---
It's not a bug.
---
I did the math for The Deadmines a while back.
---
|Level|Full XP|1.4 boost|/5 split|
---
--:|--:|--:|--:|
---
|18|50073.5|70102.9|14021|
---
|19|47656.5|66719.1|11092|
---
|20|45770|64078|10651|
---
|21|42001|58801.4|9761‚Äã|
---
A full run at level 18, with other level 18s, should grant about 14,000xp
---
Asmongold and Efsand ran The Deadmines at level 18.
---
Efsand was 19 bubbles into 18, hit 19 inside. He finished the run 11.8 bubbles into level 19.
---
The math for those bubbles ends up being 13,537xp for the run.
---
Accounting for rounding errors in estimating bubble accuracy, its the exact same.
---
#dungeon xp seems accurate.
---
There's plenty of both pros and cons and vanilla pvp isn't competitive where it would ever effect in game really. Orc is still going to be a way better pick for shaman/hunter/warrior in any min/max situation.
---
Maybe he should have spent more time on vocab than archaic technicalities no longer enforced in formal writing, let alone conversation.
---
Also remember that you have 2 yards of extra range too.
---
yeah i‚Äôm gonna go low sugar mtn dew/low sug cola/low sug coffee as well.
---
This is not the only case though.

---
I have watched several streams and I NEVER saw this happen before today.
---
Pros and cons for sure! Idk why everyone need to be so negative all the time
---
that was fricking gold
---
Did you resub monthly or did you just purchase a month of game time? And if only a month, did u use a wow token or real money?
---
Well that's not surprising considering you're literally playing BFA with some lines of code deleted/tweaked.
---
Which word do you think I do not understand?
---
I've been enjoying Guzu's stream (orc rogue) and ive enjoyed that. Solid dude.
---
DBM in Vanilla vs DBM in retail are virtually identical. The interface hasn't even changed in over a decade.
---
Compare that to an addon like decursive in its original vanilla state where you just had a macro for /decursive and it actually played the game for you.
---
Found it on Thingiverse.
---
The gold still must come from somewhere. In Classic the only sources of gold are vendoring items and doing quests, and there are ni repeatable quests in Classic that reward money. There are no dailies, no LFD and LFR. This is why even on years old private servers the prices remain largely the same. 
---
If the gold price on tokens increases too much then people won't afford them and they will decrease again.
---
I mean, even just messing around and leveling is still giving them data. All of the quests they do, each mob they kill, each time they move is something that may be done correctly. If, lets say, ten people do a quest, and it works, that's something that the dev team can cross off the list.
---
Those weather effects make me wet.
---
This is exactly what I did! Unlucky squad
---
False. Anyone without a sub will not get an invite. You need an active sub to be flagged for beta. You also need a sub to play in the beta after you get access
---
While I can agree no one should tell you how to play. To the people defending rushing to 60, I swear to God if you get to 60 in 2 weeks do all the endgame and start bitching and whinging about lack of content or "let's get a tbc phase now". I'll fucking scream. It's these fuck twats that drive blizzard to do "play the patch" strategy.
---
There's a gajillion videos on YouTube that go far more in depth than anyone here will. You should also go to the sidebar and look at the Classy Friday posts.
---
There are *many* guilds recruiting.
---
See here for example: https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
It's almost like they are, and I can not stress this enough, TESTING things in their BETA TEST.
---
Sweet, thanks!
---
does... does it hurt?
---
Lol you are trying to hard to sound like a pro, but you still try to compare the mentality on the pservers to the mentality of vanilla despite the fact that they are literally 2 different games (go watch the video of the pserver twitch streamers shitting the bed in the beta wc if you don‚Äôt believe me)
---
You really need to lose the min max attitude if you want to get along on classic, and trying to sound like a pro because you advocate such an attitude makes it obvious you are bad.
---
They want a mix of all types of players. Non vanilla players are very valuable to blizzard. Their opinions and insight is essential to longevity of classic and other classic related directives like tbc and or progression servers.
---
I play retail and this is so inaccurate. You pop into LFG and most of the time people don‚Äôt really reply, even when you say hello. As soon as the dungeon is finished they just leave group and look for another dungeon. Maybe 25% of the time I get talkers who may or may not want to queue for another dungeon together afterwards. I can‚Äôt remember the last time anyone said ‚Äúthanks for the run‚Äù unless it was a really fast run.
---
I feel you.  Seems the community has become more hostile since the rapid ramp up.  I‚Äôd give some input, but I‚Äôve never properly played vanilla and never made it beyond 34 on Pservers.
---
The retarded part is that people actually pay some of these goobers to watch them act like jack asses while playing video games. I don't watch streamers because I can't imagine waisting my time watching other people play video games when I could play them myself, but if I did, could you tell me a popular streamer who doesn't act like his parents fed him paint chips?
---
Honestly, this is kind of belongs in some streamer highlight sub or something. There is nothing funny or special about this.
---
uhhh pretty sure it will be mostly used for language people dont like. also they stated there will be no automatic part in the system a human will go over the reports so if you report a non reportable offense you will be the one facing consequences....
---
Cata was fun at first... till blizz nerfed the dungeons.
---
Look how they layer'd my boy üò¢
---
This isn't working for me. Nothing is there and nothing happens when i click.
---
Same for all the links at the left for fast browsing, the links are there this time, but when i click the only thing it does is opening the spreadsheet in another tab on the introduction image.
---
Idk why but backpedaling and clicking spells really frustrates me. Esfand is great but, he makes so many simple mistakes like Swifty that if fixed, could make him incredible.
---
Could be worse, he could be a HUNTER backpeddling
---
For PvP, Resto is the best of the 3 specs by far. While I love playing Druid in Vanilla, it just feels wrong to be Balance/Feral and almost play the same way, as if you were Resto. It's always about slowly killing people while you outsustain them. The only thing that changes a little bit, is that you can get a big Ravage off as Feral and dots hurting a bit more as Balance. In my opinion, TBC did it way better with druids, where you actually spent much more time in your Cat form/Moonkin form using offensive spells. It felt like your specialization mattered a bit more outside of Resto.
---
He is Canadian
---
We all know how its going to be. 
---
The hype will be INSANE the first week/weeks, but it will quickly drop.
---
If 2 million start playing at launch, I expect 10% to be left 6 months in. There is only so much a casual player can do in classic.
---
right, because as i said they did have a larger melee range.
---
Some or all of the following:
---
elitist
---
gatekeeping
---
social
---
And/or the phrase "mutually exclusive."
---
My problem was never the breath timer.  My problem was that I'd jump right into it as soon as it became available... and the aggro radius and repop rate on those murlocs was crazy at that wreck.
---
Yes and some people are better at making money than others, which is why I disagree with paying 20 dollars to be given money that is going to negatively impact an economy. Putting in artificial gold sinks is going to slowly kill the economy.
---
The formulas were changed in 2.4 or earlier but up until then, they are "accurate" (not really since some classes lack data, but it's the closest reference we got).
---
Well you seem to be talking about lambos a lot in regards to big streamers so you kinda did?
---
What's with all the classic wow stuff coming out now?
---
little payo ofc
---
SM is good in both raids and PvP. It's a percent or two behind DS in terms of DPS but a lot more useful to the raid and especially outside of the raid. Especially in premades where SL and conflag is not particularly good, they are more duelling and wPvP specs.
---
Nope
---
There‚Äôs weekly guild recruitment threads.  I‚Äôd recommend checking those out.  The variety of player is too great to make a super subreddit guild, imho.
---
Stealth running to farm instance bosses for days. Ultimate STV gank squad lol.
---
Got it. I should be totally fine then. Can‚Äôt wait to Crit nuke some gnomes!
---
I don't think that's very likely.
---
Legion was kinda meh, honestly.
---
Aren't they explaining classic with some Time travel stuff with Cromie? Alt timeline anyone?
---
Also, what an MMORPG is and how it is different from a single player/small group RPG.
---
beta started this week
---
Gotta keep that power curve
---
Your monitor also probably now has twice the resolution.
---
I want to do TBC but I dont care if we do that at level 60 or level 70. If they want to tune the content to be viable @ 60 then I am all for it but I do want to do all that content rather than just new content.
---
There are few i consider good, none that i would count as great. Jesse is easily the most likeable, but far from enough on his own. I would not consider Tips anything of the sort, and am honestly quite disturbed by a guy like that getting followers, but to each their own. 
---
Jesse Cox you mean? He's Omfgcata. Started making videos during the cata beta and became huge since. He is very much a vanilla veteran aye. A terrible player, a great personality, an actually respectable dude with integrity.
---
Well, in 'original' Vanilla raids, a DPS Feral druid surely was a wasted spot, because 3% crit didn't make up for doing literally than half the DPS of the melee classes you buffed. Now that we're more clever and powershifting is a thing, and a feral druid can rival some of the best melee classes out there on Patchwerk bosses, it's actually worth it.
---
There's a closed beta happening. The streamer community was given high priority to be a part of it.
---
Damn that sucksssss. What other race makes a good looking shaman? Tauren I guess?
---
Because the people who love to rush using 3rd party auto pilot apps and mods bitch and whinge the most about lack of content. It then forces blizzard to gate things and focus on "play the patch". Most people that are gonna rush to 60 are going to immediately start screaming for tbc.
---
I cant be the only one who'd like to see them OVER tune everything. I'd love to have all the bosses more difficult than original since this is basically going to be a sandbox in terms of content
---
Actually also very fun as a paladin to babysit a warrior with BRE running around tearing up the clothies.
---
No joke, honestly you can hate on asmongold all you want, but you know cities are going to be raided round the clock on that server.  Unfortunately for me I have to roll on a pvp server so heres hoping one of them goes on a pvp one.
---
No worries, you said you're still playing live, that's probably the best starting point with finding other players that are going to classic that you currently play with.
---
Yeah people should never get upset, it shows passion, and passion is bad. We should all be empty shells with nothing interesting to do or think all our lives.
---
The only real issue with that part is when multiple candles are lit, bringing double the mobs.
---
Troll Master race.
---
They are in the sense of faction balance. Splitting them is similar to asking Ally War/Horde War.
---
Flyff has 0 loading screens except for dungeons. And if your computer can load fast enough you can even use the very limited teleport items without missing a frame.
---
The game is p2w garbage but I didn‚Äôt even know loading screens were so prevalent until I quit.
---
Also runescape
---
It was monthly
---
Dwarves!
---
I usually went just a bit north from the port. 
---
People would be farming mobs and other stuff to the south which just disturbs you.
---
No, they swapped back over to the old player models. They had totally different skeletons and body meshes, the updated texture models wouldn't work on them.
---
Is it like an official blizzard thing or a private server?
---
aaand add wrath tuned to 60! :)
---
I certainly didn't feel like those two expansions had "the most WPvP." I was actively seeking out WPvP almost exclusively at those times, and the most I ever got was in Vanilla. I actually experience more WPvP in War Mode now than I did in TBC and WotLK overall. Especially WotLK, we had to organize events to get any interesting WPvP going, unless you are somehow counting WG in this. Which was more like a "open world BG" than traditional WPvP to me. Open is a bit of a stretch though, since you had to queue in. 
---
Plus it changed the entire dynamic of WPvP. Fewer big armies clashing on a field, and now just people dive bombing each other off their mounts. Raids would get in awkward stand-offs to see which side would drop to the ground first. Flying was not good for WPvP.
---
I don't think any have been made so far since most of the addon developers didn't get into the beta. The API in the client that's being used isn't exactly the same as the client that developers have been using to create addons for private servers either.   
---
I'd expect [most of the addons here](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/) to be available not long after launch.
---
Where are the numbers in the second column from?
---
Exactly what I needed, thanks!
---
That's how it works on private servers, it's not blizzlike.
---
Enrage is almost required for pvp
---
That was just a conversation between bros everyone friend group has conversations like that
---
Did you have BFA or just legion? Not sure if i need to upgrade to BFA and resub for beta invite or just resub.
---
I played a resto Druid in TBC in arena back when mace specialization was big. This was the height of resto power. The above comment is accurate.
---
I know theres plenty of reasons people say Tauren make good tanks but is this potentially one of them? If they have a bigger hitbox does that mean aoe abilities like Demo Shout and Thunderclap also reach a slightly wider circumference? I imagine its also easier to grab aggro back from stray mobs too because as they run away you can nab them easier!
---
Mage blink is the best. 
---
Or maybe it was changed in TBC.
---
this is why im strictly playing with my OG vanilla buddies 
---
gonna create a bubble and insulate myself from this garbage
---
I'm definitely interested in finding a friendly Alliance guild. I never even joined one until late TBC - I occasionally PUG-ed it up for some quests and dungeons, but I was way too anxious back then. (Mostly just played with some old friends.)
---
That being said, I was always pretty casual, choosing to explore and level professions instead of min/maxing or power leveling. I'd be cool with joining up if you don't mind a slow leveling, albeit decent Warlock.
---
Back in the day I was part of an organization called "Leftovers". By the time Naxx launched we had two Public groups (Anyone on the server could sign up) doing Molten Core and a more specialized public group was farming BWL. We took all specs, but we were limited by role and class.
---
As an example, if we split up the grouping so that we take 5 rogues, 5 hunters, 5 paladins, etc. then we'd make sure we'd have enough healers to cover the raid, but once that threshold was reached we'd look into different specs (Feral, Balance, Ret, etc.) especially if they bring something to the table (Sanctity Aura, Boomkin Crit aura, all that jazz).
---
It worked. Really well. It helps that most raid fights the good players can easily carry the raid. We had the benefit of having really good class leads who could encourage, train, and make their players better.
---
Shaman for me feel like totems are a boring concept and I'd rather play a druid for utility. Great class just not my type.
---
Only played Marksman Hunter on retail and never had a single alt.. hunter is a class i don‚Äôt enjoy is what i found out, and i quickly realised i want massive dual swords/axes and not a bow.. therefore i‚Äôll be maining fury warrior in classic.
---
Sitcrits were mainly just a flavor thing to show that while you were sitting down, you were defenseless and vulnerable.  It was never meant to be an accepted playstyle, which is why it was eventually removed.
---
**M**assively **M**ultiplayer **O**nline **R**ole**p**laying **G**ame
---
It differentiates itself by being a game where I can play with a bunch of people who share a common interest.
---
You literally said you consider people not playing a spec that does not have your personal approval to be "being a dick towards others" and anti-social.
---
I would be ok with that too but they would have to figure something out about Naxx. I don't like the idea of removing the original version so they can make the WOTLK version.
---
I get that. It would be player driven and optional. I'm not asking or expecting Blizzard to support it in any official capacity other than global LFG.
---
Wouldn't the deadzone be larger by total area for tauren hunter if the melee and ranged zones are both moved out?
---
Say 5-7 to 7-9 yards would be (3.14*7*7) -(3.14*5*5) vs (3.14*9*9)-(3.14*7*7). Being about 33% larger?

Is that correct? That size would be gleaned from the effective ranged area. If that's how the hitbox is moved out.
---
It was part of earlier patches but was removed by patch 1.12 which they use to recreate vanilla.
---
Yes! Thank you! I had no idea what Cosmos was either, but I do remember Bartender. And I want to say Bongos as well, but I can‚Äôt remember if that was a hotbar addon.
---
Official Blizzard thing. You can go to your account on Battle.net and opt-in to potentially be selected to participate in the closed beta, though you'll need game time on your account to be selected.
---
There will also be "stress tests" over the next few months (for whatever reason).
---
I can't link directly to it from here, but go to WorldofWarcraft.com and there's a Classic banner. It has all of the deets.
---
Dwarves can't be shamans haha.
---
Did you even bother looking up whats going on?
---
&gt;Old rampage glitch that lasted about 5 days until hotfixed =(
---
Yeah sure, it was a thing but then it got fixed:

&gt;**Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?**   
---
Charges generated by the forced crit when you sit do not activate reckoning.
---
Skada seems to work, and weakauras are currently being worked on.  It's only been a couple day, just give it time.
---
Playing with subs is no less annoying honestly. Any form of conduct where the streamer compromises his content to get one more little fanboi is :/ I suppose i just have higher expectations. Studying psychology irl atm, makes me over emphasize on the manipulative little things they do - most of them without knowing it, its just part of the culture at this point - to make followers. I can't unsee it, all those popups and tricks makes it feel like turning into an online casino made to extort money from kids and vulnerable loners.
---
Maybe troll but they're slouchy too.
---
you live under a rock? it's official. literally everyone's streaming this
---
Best was blinking just after being thrown in the air by boss, insta back to casting. 
---
Archimonde in TBC for instance.
---
Why.. was a big part of the game, no reason to change it
---
Official Blizzard
---
Think about it.
---
They had 2 invite waves in the last 24 hours in addition to the original wave. 
---
It is obvious they are testing the Layering software right now.
---
It was not removed in 1.12. Even later expansions had it.
---
Apples to oranges. If you think they are the same product, look at Coke's revenue vs Cadbury's. By your logic, Cadbury is fucking up royally by not advertising the way Coke does, but obviously that isn't true.
---
they aren't
---
Always a nice reminder that regular fans lose beta slots to trash like these two.
---
Play a female troll?
---
Didn't take me long to find the defensive "play it like a job" nerd
---
Am ruin is strong but not gank proof at all.
---
A druid running 0/30/21 can evade most solo players, but is vulnerable to warlock fear and frost shock spam. It is considered the BiS flagrunner for a reason.
---
Yeah, global LFG is a great thing that Blizzard should support. I'm hoping the community will create a global general just to banter in.
---
You still need 2 copies of WoW under your account, just like a multiboxer. If you try and log in with the same copy of the account it will kick the other guy out.
---
No, I am upset that we have to get official information about the project from blizzard, not directly, but via third parties who are annoying AF.
---
Yeah but where in there do you find a life?
---
No, there's that at lvl 60.
---
And if you can come up with a legitimate reason for playing a spec that is anything but "to make the game worse for others" then that spec is on my personal approval list.
---
I used to 3v1 I‚Äôd rogues as a human warrior.  Overpower and plate really fucks rogues.  Any of the ‚Äúkite bleed‚Äù strategies fail 90% of the time.
---
Honestly the best strategy for rogues against warrior is just to try and out burst.
---
Very true, but my point was, didn't they end on the round numbers?
---
Ooooh, normally I hate grammar nazis but that was fucking beautiful man.
---
Yeah I could do that or a female Orc. I usually prefer males though so maybe just a Tauren.
---
Oh, yeah. I didn‚Äôt remember the respawn being that bad, but I typically overleveled it slightly before trying. Which is why I didn‚Äôt remember their aggro radius being that bad. Although it was really aggravating when they‚Äôd aggro on you right through the hull.
---
Read the guide by totemtank - it's the most elaborate shaman tanking guide I've seen. 
---
You're gonna be leveling as enhance anyways, and during leveling (in my experience) anyone that is actively trying to actually tank, is doing a better job than an optimal tank class that is not trying to. 
---
I have tanked a few dungeon encounters as a shaman like leveling, I've healed pets that were tanking dungeons, it's definitely doable. 
---
As mentioned by someone else, it's possible to tank pretty much anything that isn't a raid as a shaman, if you're willing to try a little harder than your average Joe.
---
Nice video. Never did any fishing in my previous WoW experience but I am excited to try it out. Just out of curiosity how does the fishing extravaganza work and how hard is it to win?
---
They might just be testing things. But why are they layering when every stream I've watched is pretty much a ghost town?
---
Hold up, beauty and the beast? Thats your burn, your advice? I should go watch beauty and the beast? Which one are you, which one is tier three subs lol? I have such a wtf face right now.
---
That is a big "maybe". I doubt all of the devs for those add-ons will magically come back to recreate them. On top of that, the API for classic is based off Legion/BFA so they would unfortunately need to be recreated/ported.
---
from my understanding they are going off of patch 1.12 in which case this was not a thing.
---
&gt; I certainly didn't feel like those two expansions had "the most WPvP." I  was actively seeking out WPvP almost exclusively at those times, and  the most I ever got was in Vanilla. I actually experience more WPvP in  War Mode now than I did in TBC and WotLK overall. Especially WotLK, we  had to organize events to get any interesting WPvP going, unless you are  somehow counting WG in this. Which was more like a "open world BG" than  traditional WPvP to me. Open is a bit of a stretch though, since you  had to queue in. 
---
That's fair enough. I can't tell you how to feel. And I didn't count WG into this.
---
&gt; Plus it changed the entire dynamic of WPvP. Fewer big armies clashing on  a field, and now just people dive bombing each other off their mounts.  Raids would get in awkward stand-offs to see which side would drop to  the ground first. Flying was not good for WPvP. 
---
Rogues ganking you from stealth or dive bombing you from a flying mount. Warriors charging you from their epic mount while you're fighting a mob, or dive bombing you from a flying mount. I don't see the difference, people still started fights.
---
I do think it was boring to see people idle on their flying mounts to avoid World PvP, but as I mentioned in my last comment, TBC and WOTLK had enough people on the ground, so it wasn't that big of a problem.
---
Give warlocks dark simulacrum
---
It's up to a developer to know what is best for their game. Players and fans will always have bad ideas, doesn't mean you have to run with them.
---
Warrior: click enemy, jump, furiously spam charge button
---
can we create a r/classicwowstreamers?

I can't be the only one that doesn't give a fuck about twitch or the troglodytes that live there
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralAgileCatTwitchRPG
---
Very well made! Good job mate.
---
That could also be an issue with spawns, but in any case that's not proper behavior. Hopefully it got reported.
---
Yeah it probably would, I was just saying you have to transition through those states to get to different forms.  Pretty sure the cancelaura to powershift while in cat
---
Your quote doesn't say that at all. Just that it doesn't give you a reckoning charge.
---
Once they release official realm names and (if they do it again battle groups for pvp) I‚Äôm down for having a close-nitted group to tackle leveling even if it‚Äôs slow. As I mentioned I never got a real chance at classic wow, and I know the leveling is dreadfully long. So I don‚Äôt expect to be max within a week. Id love the company!
---
Yes, I know this. But will we both be able to be in the launcher at the same time without it kicking one of us? Is there a way to manually log into wow without using the launcher at all?

Yeah EoC was nice, too. Makes sense. My memory definitely isn't the best from the period, but I remember not passing up rogues too often
---
Again, if your common interest is "excluding people who are friendly but play an off spec," then these two groups are mutually exclusive, and you are a gatekeeping elitist.
---
Meanwhile in retail:
---
[Party] [You]: GG guys, well done. Keep it up.
---
[Party] [Them]: STFU
---
The result of a profit driven system...capitalism.
---
Then you have the weird back hump. You really can't  play a male on the horde and not get that neckbeard slouch going.
---
Same with my little Gnome Mage
---
I have the dilemma of re rolling my main and playing classes I remember being really cool. And the dilemma comes not only with class, but certain specs that were super fun during vanilla...
---
So my main was a rogue, and I‚Äôll always be a rogue at heart, any spec and under any scenario. 
---
But damn if vanilla didn‚Äôt have some fun classes unique to that time. For instance...
---
Destro warlocks. Really explosive, lots of damage and endless mana if you‚Äôre in PvE. I remember destro locks usually topping damage meters in raids because of their endless mana, as well as being deadly in PvP. 
---
Shadow priest. Shadow priest to me were best in vanilla. Lots of damage (damage that would heal) and were a rare breed with a unique play style. 
---
Enhance shamans. They were also a rare and unique play style. I remember the baddest guy on my server was a high warlord shaman with a hand of ragnaros. Nobody could touch him..
---
And then you had paladins. They have always been OP, but there was something about a paladin in vanilla that annoyed the fuck out of you. If you saw one in full judgement, you would literally just avoid them. If I wasn‚Äôt true to horde I would probably be one...
---
My honorable mentions are warriors (because they are always needed and honestly super easy at end game) and then frost mages. I remember every frost mage had a quick bind for a level one frost bolt, making it impossible if you were melee to touch them. 
---
This is my first post in this sub reddit and I just found out about classic wow a week ago. As a vanilla player who quit 4 years ago I‚Äôve been geeking the fuck out about this release and I cannot wait.
---
Does this mean hunters have melee weapons again!?
---
Hunters always seemed pretty easy as long as you got to charge them and the didn‚Äôt dismiss their pet.
---
Nah you need to have game time or an active sub. However, yes there are many non influencers playing.
---
Then there's a lack of correlation with the original build.
---
Using the BlueTracker from the Wayback machine you can read a Blue-posted Reckoning guide from back in 2006.

The /sit macro was famously patched somewhere around 1.9 and it carried over into 1.12.

&gt; ‚ÄúCan I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?‚Äù
---
&gt; ‚Äú**Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.** However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.‚Äù
---
Jesus christ dude get this cringe stuff out of here.
---
Thans didnt know
---
Lol no it didn't
---
I seem to remember it being 0-9. That‚Äôs why Shadowfang was so insanely popular (and expensive) as a twink weapon.
---
I think that's just how they did the announcement. Since it's a standalone game I don't think they need to explain it with any lore.
---
Fuck off
---
No. I was specific. You claimed that no one will ever be big. I countered saying no one would ever be lambo big. That requires only one person to reach that size, not a "majority"
---
For the record, several have reached that size.
---
i'd repost with each lineage cropped and its own image , might make for a 20 pic album but worth

I hate streamers but that's funny right there

People will still be getting moved around though
---
It was an abuse of mechanics that lead to unintended an gameplay style.
---
Do you have a 2004 or early 2005 account? That is who they are inviting right now, might stretch to late 2005 but I haven't seen any 2006 accounts or later get in (other than the super rare person or someone who got personally invited for being a streamer or friend of a streamer).
---
He didn't post the clip to demonstrate how to kill a mob. Why so many weirdos in this sub?
---
Now who's the person who doesn't know what mutually exclusive means.
---
"Here's this person who is friendlily being a dick to you", yea, that's not an oximoron at all.
---
Not really. He had spent the last decade on private servers. Just saying
---
I was wondering the same thing but wasn't quite sure how to phrase it. Maybe somebody can answer it for us, upvoted for visibility.

I think OP is talking about critting sitting players in general but I might be wrong.

Agreed.

Guaranteed that at least 70% of those warlocks will be undead
---
BC class gameplay LUL.

Like anyone wants to return to SL/SL Warlock, Stunherald, and god Druids.
---
MoP PvP was good. You act like everyone having defensives is bad. What, you prefer Vanilla/TBC PvP where if a Rogue opened on you there was a 90% chance you were going to die? MoP had a massive skill ceiling, easily higher than any xpac.
---
BM Hunter was trash in PvP too, btw.
---
Inb4 BuT ShOuLdN‚Äôt ThEy bE TeStIng FoR BugS???
---
God I can‚Äôt wait for it to be aug 27th!!! I never messed around in the arena very much. I just never knew when or how it really worked, and I raided through AQ. There‚Äôs just so much to explore!
---
There was a point in vanilla where the dmg reduction of defensive stance would let you survive any fall, as it would take it from 100% of your health to less than that, regardless of height. Good fun. Once it changed i still had that old viking shield lol
---
Every pull basically can end one of two ways: 
---
The creeps are all dead or you are dead.  
---
Warriors only have 2 panic switches either recklessness (30 min cool down) or intimidating shout. 
---
I.S. is an aoe fear that can basically cause more monsters to aggro, and if you are already trying to flee this is the last thing you want.
---
It is therefore very important to be proactive if you might have to flee.  Make sure you hamestring the creep, and have a path of egress, BEFORE you are in the red.
---
Often you will have to decide to bug out before 50% health in order to have enough time to escape.
---
I think this is mainly the reason they wouldn't do it. I'd wager the developers would love to sneak it in there but corporate would never approve it.
---
Well it's not like tips even gave him a chance lol
---
#greatforpornthough

^ 100% this, it isn't a subreddit for funny or fails of streamers on wow.

But this community seems to eat all this streamer bs up.

I'm not an RP'er but I support you guys on your endeavor, Help the homies out bliz give them their classic experiences as well!
---
Lol, ‚Äúcan't lose the argument if I keep doubling down!‚Äù
---
Yeah its not really a bug and its something that's been part of the game for a long time (at least while I played).
---
Tipsout is the best. He has all the latest content and great info!
---
Technically shouldnt layering not be in play on the beta based on how many players are in? Also i havent seen any clips of sharding from the streams i've watched, but i also feel like the world is pretty empty in general cuz you know, beta.
---
Rule 2, protect me from meanies, I have no spine? Sorry can't help there. Try inserting yourself into the real world and growing a sack.
---
Stop taking for most of us, Jesus people don‚Äôt get it. I have friends who‚Äôve never played vanilla and want to rush to 60, because that‚Äôs how they have fun, by being a ‚Äútry hard‚Äù or w/e
---
Again, that's a flagrantly elitist perspective.  "People playing the game how they want" is not a personal affront to you in any way, and the fact you see it as such is delusional and indicative of a fairly warped personality.
---
Oh so you're a minion. :)
---
Ahh, well no, they will not be adding that option.  I'll be the slouching troll laughing at you.

That's interesting mine was a little different

---
Or Phase 2. WSG and AV are phase 3
---
Well, yes, I agree. But, that was 12-15 years ago. 
---
Game was different. Playerbase didn't have nearly as much knowledge as they do now. Guides, addons, experience. 
---
Realistically speaking, we all have done Naxx by now. We know the mechanics. We know the fights and what is good &amp; what is not. 
---
All I am saying, it would be nice to see the game spiced up. We do know that Blasted Lands &amp; Emerald Dream were meant to be part of Vanilla, but got never implemented. So, we never got to witness those concepts in its original state. Would be cool to add new stuff that no one has experienced.
---
People getting down votes for thinking people having maga spinoff hat's, and names like tipsout is stupid as fuck and cringe is exactly why we want an rp PvP server. We don't want to be casual but we also don't want the playerbase to feel like a round of cs go match making
---
Actually some of it goes towards twitch. But you‚Äôre right. I just meant that‚Äôs how some look at it not me personally.
---
Yeah it looks ugly
---
On this note, there aren‚Äôt fish schools in vanilla. So be prepared to spend hours farming like a 20% drop rate on deviate fish. Back then, I found the pond before the hallway leading to WC instance portal the best drop rate for them.
---
Good points. I didn't think about the impact on non-hunter/shaman
---
Go to [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) site and look at the games you have. It will show as a PTR but dont be fooled if you already have a PTR account, in this case there will be 2 PTR
---
&gt; That is about reckoning for gods sake
---
OP's post:
---
&gt; ‚Äúpeople used it to stack reckoning‚Äù
---
Hell one of the largest servers on retail is an RPPVP server, there's no way a single server per region is too small a niche.
---
Stay dumb and stay entitled my friend
---
&gt; ther people can play the game in ways you personally don't approve of.
---
Of course they can, I don't disapprove of how you choose to play a game as long as you play within the rules, just don't expect me to want to play with you if that entails you being a dick to me.
---
"No changes"
---
Classic was designed to be a ROLE playing game not a epeen measuring device.  It's more fun to a play a character than resort to instant gratification.  Also, according to some, a week is enough time to defeat ragnaros but I guess you would need online guides and databases to do it that fast.
---
Bro... Those projections, lmao...
---
You're taking a week off work to play video games. You deserve to be shamed.
---
Wow that really made you mad, you should work on that...
---
Not going to dig through wayback for this. If you think it was there report it to Blizzard and they'll check on their reference client.
---
Yes, just like you will be playing alongside those very same types of people once Classic launches.  If you can't handle that, then go back to private servers.
---
You don't have to play the beta, just wait for release.
---
any job openings?
---
Yes, because it's a title that grabs attention. In literally the very first paragraph, the intended audience is clarified. This is the biggest non issue of the entire post.
---
Drop the tin foil hat, stop the hate and do something else with your life.
---
&gt; people used it to stack reckoning and rampage
---
That's what OP is talking about.
---
Because most of the streamers in are retail streamers. We all know why they are streaming it
---
"Great Moments in Classic WoW History"
---
holy shit i can smell the entitlement from my house
---
Even the most optimistic Classic fans are going to be blown up by the numbers. Sure, Blizzard won't release them soon, but there are plenty of ways to estimate the numbers.
---
My personal opinion is that at least 4 million, and as much as 8 million will be on Classic launch.
---
Yes beta for a private server that all streamers are streaming lol
---
You can subscribe to a twitch streamer. 5 dollars a month is tier one. Tier two is 10. Tier 3 is 25$.
---
indeed
---
Long, yes. But that's okay - it gives me time to grind out the pattern for Robes Of Arcana without out leveling the area. I must have all the patterns!... and also sell a bunch of robes to bankroll the guild early on. Market permitting. (I paid for the mounts for three friends selling those things.)
---
I'd be honored to be the official guild Bag Supplier üòÇ
---
Well 2006 is EU Time. There is no 2004 Accounts. And some EUs are in, so dunno =/
---
You're the one responding. Don't cry too much!

Gotta say druids as well. I love the designs for at least half of their roles, but shapeshifting just doesn't do a damn thing for me.
---
Plus I love seeing my fabulous garments on my personage. And being a beast denies me that luxury üíÖüèº
---
If by live under a rock you mean 'someone who doesnt follow streamers and has limited free time for playing video games but also played the shit out of classic wow vanilla-wotlk and is curious about all the classic wow memes coming out', then yes, I live under a rock.
---
Do you have any available resources provide to understanding what recipes you need and where? Or is it pretty much just grabbing recipes you see as you go?
---
Not going to lie, in BGs, I followed mages and waited for them to drink. 
---
I ended up one-shotting most mages with my 39twink sub rogue.
---
&gt; You will spend 95% of your time clawing
---
So only use 1 ability and that's it ? (during leveling at least)
---
Yeah he used to stream all the time! His main was a Death Knight, but he stopped playing after getting stream-sniped by a Suge Knight.
---
He wasn‚Äôt really relevant until late tbc.
---
Remember, some realms used to struggle while others didn't. My servers were illidan, burning legion and spirestone
---
We need to hear his voice in order to get a straight answer. If he sounds like a heavy smoker who ran 2 miles (but didn‚Äôt actually run) then I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the real Towelie.
---
If you wan't QoL pretty sure there's a game called Battle For Azeroth that you may like.
---
my post is about if /sit 100% crit was a thing or not read title
---
Yes, we've established that you consider yourself somehow not an elitist gatekeeper by being an elitist gatekeeper, and that an MMORPG is all about you and you alone.  Community?  Social interaction?  Nah, just gettin' your numbers higher.
---
Something went wrong in my table... 66,719 / 5 is 13,343
---
And 13,537 Esfand got is closer to 13,343 than it is to 14,000.
---
So yes.
---
Maybe this is why less EU players are getting in
---
He's hit far harder than other enemies in the dungeon as far as I can remember. And I've only tanked since Wrath.
---
Do you need to own BfA to be eligible for the beta? Or just an active sub.
---
quit
---
Completing a dungeon with four strangers is so damn satisfying. Especially when y‚Äôall naturally adjust to each other‚Äôs play-styles halfway through
---
Alrighty well I'm sure someone will add the old one back for you, just don't forget we played with lower resolution monitors back then, it didn't seem that bad. It's a big difference now.
---
I really hope the dev of swing timers updates his, and his overpower one too. Love those on my warrior

THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS!!!!!
---
So we should stare in Awe at this guy because Asmongold talked about him for 15 seconds?
---
Get real dude.
---
I lost so much sleep getting the Arena Grand Master trinket on my twink character. Setting my alarm every 3 hours. Had my best chance at 3am
---
Aha, thanks for the notice. So there will be a window popping up? And you just let it be or x it out?
---
I can't even log in retail anymore.
---
Thanks! Looks like I haven‚Äôt made it yet. Fingers crossed. :)
---
OwO
---
* *notices bulge* *
---
Yeah, death threats are super funny. Imagine that you have even gotten 91 upvotes. Alexsensual got that many fans here? I can't believe people actually follow him, then again alot of people are pretty stupid.
---
It is if the reason that's "how they want" is because it makes the game worse of other people.
---
See I haven‚Äôt even gotten around to figure out if I want to be a craftsmen or a gatherer. Since I want to try and have a surplus of money I‚Äôm thinking just farming raw materials but I know once the initial hype dies down so will the hold value of a lot of materials. So I‚Äôm having a struggle trying to figure out my best professions üòÖ
---
And very unhealthy
---
Lol calm down dude no one is telling you how to play: you can make that decision for yourself. I'm merely pointing out that he is speaking specifically to new players (as made evident in the very first sentence) and that there are some cool things to experience if they take their time. Your friends can do whatever they want to do; they are in the minority and there is nothing wrong with that...
---
Just had someone remind me that my Paladin‚Äôs name was Gryphin.
---
Just because other people played without them doesn't mean they should, not using them is stupid.
---
Like I said mods will fix it if it's not right. You could (should!) also report it as a bug.
---
&gt; Also in vanilla most people played without nameplates anyway.
---
That‚Äôs a bold statement with no source
---
just you wait, that sub was pretty srs bsns at first before it turned into the paragon it is today
---
This is fantastic.
---
Dammit Bonnie!
---
I‚Äôve tried to (with no luck) entertain myself with retail wow just on the basis that I hope 8.2 is good enough to keep me preoccupied until classic launch but I can‚Äôt even bring myself to do the daily emissary quests at this point. Restarting bnet client in between overwatch loses is taking its toll to the point of eventually giving up and just watching streams of it. TLDR: it‚Äôs hard invest time in any other game when classic is right there
---
&gt;/sit 100% crit was a thing in vanilla
---
how is that misleading?
---
[Dirge]
---
You are forgetting about the business people are the ones who make the decisions, not the product people. And the business people are taught that the "customer is always right"
---
It was a thing for a part of Vanilla, it also was either hotfixed / nerfed at some point in a later patch. I think it was the same patch that did the Paladin revamp, but i'm not sure on that. After which you would still get crit while sitting but it would not let you gain proc's or stacks anymore.
---
This is like someone making a post titled ‚ÄúThe Earth is actually round!‚Äù

This is exactly why I'm excited! It's not to be level 60. It's to be a player along the way.
---
ur a sheep
---
The race to 60 is absolutely MY favorite part of leveling. I don‚Äôt leave the server afterwards, I enjoy many other things at max level. But the experience of starting on a fresh server and trying to stay focused and effective leveling to 60 is a challenge and very rewarding in many ways. 
---
Like many have said, don‚Äôt listen to people that try to tell you how to play this game. You‚Äôll find what you enjoy no problem.
---
wasnt there some period in wows life cycle where inspect distance was like infinite? i remember that being the case..
---
You're on the classic wow subreddit, theres literally a pinned post with the release schedule at the top of the sub. Every gaming or wow themed website has been raving about this all week. 
---
Don't walk into a room with your hands over your eyes and then ask what's going on and then get defensive when you're called out on it.
---
I still have my robo racer thing that you got from that promo and my racer fuel on one toon
---
intelligent response
---
Don't think so, seems to be added sometime during TBC, not Vanilla.
---
This is like someone making a post titled: ‚ÄúThe Earth is actually round!‚Äù
---
I agree. Played shaman in Vanilla and got some real enjoyment out of windfury proc crits with my Unstoppable Force :)
---
Yeah it may have been early on in WoW's release lifespan, I don't recall exactly when it was fixed.  Any sort of % damage reduction or shielding effect such as priest's PW:S would prevent a fall damage death.  They were all fixed at the same time.
---
I think where this thread went off the rails was that OP is just asking if /sit lead to 100% crit chance, which it did but everyone is assuming he meant that it should also contribute towards reckoning and rampage stacks which was patched out.
---
Absolutely correct. A+ and a gold star
---
Do you know what that means?  Because it makes no sense in this context sweet heart.
---
Yeah, that leads me to believe it's relatively intuitive, just have to make a mental note to pay attention to recipes available.
---
So your argument shifted. First it was "only bad tanks cant dodge the fear". Now its "Horde can do it", but apparently horde using a spell that dispells Fear isnt a valid explanation?
---
Wait till all the cancer streamers like Tips say they are going for world first Scarab Lord in classic, since they never actually played vanilla. Good luck on the title that didn't exist.
---
yea totally snapped my DOTA 2 addiction
---
Oh man, seeing a clothy sitting and drinking is a rogue's wet dream.
---
I'm not forcing people to do anything, I just don't want to play with people who are dicks to me, if someone else will, they can be dicks to them all they want, if they can't find people to play with, then maybe the problem is them, not me.
---
Also, how does playing a game well make it worse?
---
I mean look at the videos, it took me a while to find even one with a player using nameplates.
---
Yeah, I didnt clip it but earlier in the stream Asmon asked him if he thinks they didn't get in "fair and square" and McConnel straight up told them that they are being used for advertisement. I mean, it isn't exactly a hot take, but Asmon deflected right away to something else like he always does like he was nervous lol.
---
Either is fine, but just don't go dual wield.  The miss chance from holding two weapons will hurt you too much at low levels due to lack of +hit gear.
---
It is pretty close. Try and compare it with an arcane frost mage trying to PvP, it's a shameful display really.
---
Wpvp is the only reason I kept playing back in the day.
---
TBH they could just cycle through Classic-BC-LK and i think it will be a huge success. I see what your asking for, i also think its telling that you mention that it would be a ‚Äúguranteed failiure‚Äù - BC and LK is not what you want, thats cool. But there is a horde of fans out there who do want it. Remember you are not everyone, and Blizzard listening to community feedback is what killed WoW. The community is fucking retarded on so many levels, i‚Äôm still salty they nerfed the original Cata heroics that were really challenging because they were ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù
---
I saw several streamers get tells from people who got in who aren‚Äôt subbed
---
its like a complete 50-50 split, some people are posting screenshots saying you must have an active subscription from the GMs, while others are saying they have been invited without a sub, no idea.
---
Dude has no idea what he talks about.
---
What the fuck is a troglodyte
---
Lol don‚Äôt be soft. I can‚Äôt tell ur gunna rage quit when u get camped/spam fucked up messages to the opposing factions. Ur skin is too thin. Grow up
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/InventiveSlipperyBaguetteKAPOW
---
It's hilarious if you spec for it properly, because you will legit do 1000 damage Ambushes at low levels. Doubly fun when they're eating/drinking.
---
Last great expansion was WOTLK.
---
I can see I'm already being downvoted, thanks wow classic community lol
---
Shaman Tank Raid Guide, here: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
Well if thats the only reason you resubbed you done goofed
---
Is that 3d printed? Can I have an Empyrean Demolisher please?
---
If you're going to play a PVP server. Arms the entire way. If you're going PVE it's up to you if you want to try fury won't really matter too much pre-40.
---
2h weapon. As slow weapon speed as possible.
---
Base dmg.
---
Same. I feel I experienced everything he said there was to offer leveling early in Wrath. I did all the pre-nerfed versions of dungeons besides the BRM dungeons, there was no lfg by the time I got to 58 (when I hopped to outlands), I did every quest chain but linken's but that and the BRM dungeons an end-game area do it won't be missed rushing to 60. I don't even think mounts were 20 yet at the time, still had to be 40 to buy them.
---
I played back then and had no idea lol
---
If it bothers you so much and it isn't in the game don't play the game at all.
---
What more do you want me to say?
---
You think "no changes" is so genius? you'd have to be an idiot if you think that would be the case.
---
I been picking fights with these people all day.  Sadly they just double down on their ‚Äúmin max‚Äù pserver mentality despite the pserver kids recently shitting the bed in the beta live on twitch .
---
Im having the same issue. Im pretty certain my old vanilla account was eventualy recovered and merged into my bnet but after all these years, character transfers and renames i don't remember which on it is or if it even is. And blizzards website doesn't show any way to see the age of each wow account.
---
I have 10 wow accounts on this bnet atm so its a nightmare.
---
That's cool and all but not my point. Bash the post all you want for that. I don't care how people play the game. If you're going to go in on post, at least make the effort of having actually read it correctly instead of going into a rage over the title.
---
At least you realize it was stupid...
---
Snubbing Frost and Kargoz made me lose faith in Blizz. How stupid can they be?
---
There's a bunch I'd love to have, I don't expect every single one to make it's way back but the needed ones, like KTM, some sort of damage meters, maybe updated unit frames too
---
I've had it confirmed you do.
---
I'll take Blizzards word over random reddit users.
---
You know how much you can make off of low level wands? That‚Äôs how I paid for my 60% mount at lvl 57.
---
Dont worry I'm not letting the garbo tank off the hook.
---
Prove it‚Äôs a minority before you assume your the majority, talking down to people on this sub is just sooo pervasive. Everyone thinks their the majority, no changes, casuals, min/makers, it‚Äôs so fking pedantic. And he continuously through the post points to that being the fun way not the rush to 60 way. The fun way is both. That‚Äôs the answer. When writing this post op could have said it was a fun option, but implies that it‚Äôs the fun option.
---
HS to dump rage when a boss is at 5 sunders is totally fine, but that wasnt the biggest issue, the biggest issue was not using shield block and fishing revenge proccs which is super good and cheap threat and shield block also reduces damage taken. Yeah at normal pulls you don't really heroic at all, that i agree with.
---
Haha yeah, really nice one!
---
"language people don't like"
---
Y'know, like virulent racism and sexism that really makes people feel fucking uncomfortable in a game where everyone really should be welcome.
---
Anyone remember Syf the Giver?
---
3 sec between swings only to miss. If you want to go oom every single normal mob pallies are great.
---
No, see, you've completely inverted the concept of respect here.  The game isn't all about you.  You don't get to tell people what to do.  You're equal with every other player.  Friendly reminder, this is an MMORPG.
---
I'm not trolling anybody.  I main a totally normal frost spec mage.  If I wanted to play a ret paladin or a shadow priest, it isn't because I want to be a dick.  I doubt anyone is doing it to be a dick.  You straight up got problems, bro.
---
It does let you proc overpower tho. I'm no expert but I've definitely heard talk about two one handers while leveling under 40
---
Is there a specific reason that this would make you mad?  Keep scrolling and say nothing if you don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs quite simple.
---
Yep, figured you were just here to bitch and run away when faced with an actual argument.
---
Hate to be that guy, but I'm assuming you are a grown up now?  You don't need to use AIDS that way anymore.
---
What this guy said
---
Whatever was said was deleted
---
That's not necessarily true, especially not as a blanket statement. I've worked on products like this, I've worked with "Business people" (I call them MBA Heroes). They don't even know enough about *everything* going on to make all of the decisions. They just latch onto "new" developments that they like and try to spear-head them as their brain child and next big accomplishment in the company. If anything you can blame terrible "new" ideas that were bad from inception on Business people. But in my experience they don't give two shits about what old features are carried over. Them just saying "Ya let's keep that" doesn't bring enough of an impact for them internally.
---
Apperently it is to late to sub now if I understand Blizzard correctly. Check number 2.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/PXfTWGY.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PXfTWGY.jpg)
---
But if it was the first 2 sentences it‚Äôs ok, got it..
---
I generally choose whatever I enjoy the most. (Like I said - casual.) I like Tailoring because it doesn't require a gathering profession, I can make myself gear whenever I'm falling behind, and I can give out bags and gear to anyone who needs them. And Enchanting can get expensive, but sue me, I enjoy it.
---
Now Engineering, that's something I've never done that looks really fun and unique. Exploding sheep and parachutes?
---
Veering off point! I do what's fun because whenever I DO actually try to do what most people consider to be "the most efficient thing," I see it as a job and get bored.
---
I think you mean Troll, there. Tanks never use Bloodfury so without that, Orcs tps is on an even playing field with Tauren. Trolls win out on tps when Bezerking gets used intelligently.
---
All moot points though. Each race has its own situational strengths and weaknesses. And besides once tanks get TF threat generation is almost a non-issue until the speartip of naxx optimisation.
---
Do both.
---
I can‚Äôt even watch this guy, he‚Äôs such an abrasive nerd it‚Äôs cringe worthy
---
You're wrong, that was in TBC.
---
Not really. It is more like a post titled "People used to mix copper and tin to create bronze"
---
And then the body of the post is: "They used it to create sculptures and coins".
---
Truth be told, playing Retail right now is a good way to hype yourself up for Classic. 
---
Running through Cataclysm Darkshore really made me miss Classic Darkshore :/
---
Noone it just puts the next people logging in not on your layer and it evens its self out.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it was the best end game at the time either, but I figured it was more of it being an mmo in a popular franchise that was designed as being a lot more casual friendly than other mmos at the time. (most mmos used to have an exp or item penalty of some sort for dying, for example)  
---
But honestly seeing all the end game raiding and pvp stuff is what got me interested so leveling in WoW has always been something to do to get to that point.
---
Solid reference üëå
---
My favorite part was him loosing to the lvl 11 rogue
---
Welllllll come on let's see it
---
Most classes need some raid gear to PvP. Most classes' T1 and T2 is garbage for raiding but brilliant for PvP, so maybe you could convince them to give you some of it.
---
I'm not a retail hater by any means, but I don't want to log in anymre either.
---
Does this apply to raiding as well? Is dual-wield not good for DPS as Fury in raiding?
---
900 before any discounts?
---
afaik it was 1000g, which is why we see either 900g (honored/Revered 10% discount) or 800g costs (pvp rank3 additional 10% discount)
---
Same blizzard that made BFA and WoD lel
---
Lol, that's why I'm happy we finally have a date. Now I can actually play something without my uncertainty and anxiousness clouding my enjoyment
---
How have you had it confirmed? We've all seen the post that is worded awkwardly. Are you referring to something else?
---
3 months till game comes out bro
---
AoE abilities should not count.
---
Example: WW is 5 yards (normal melee range). You can actually stand in a spot where you could melee a target but couldn't ww it.
---
&gt; and bond over your elitist gatekeeping.
---
Nah, we'll just have fun bonding over not being dicks towards others.
---
&gt; You are more than welcome to send me a copy of the official "How to play WoW correctly" handbook.
---
Right back at you, because apparently "getting to choose who you play with, even if said people are being dicks to you" is against the rules.
---
Ogres in Burning Steppes with my silly gnome rogue!
---
Edit this picture with lots of blood and dead animals by him and with the title "master skinner" or something like that and you may see yourself adored on the frontpage of classic wow!
---
Thanks for this link. Super awesome. Couldn‚Äôt find this info anywhere until now. Account first played in 2007... is it worth resubbing for the beta lottery?
---
yeah youre absolutely right. im being a huge idiot today. friggggggggg
---
Sad, they do Vitamin B to get invited :-(
---
You'll get hit gear at 60 so dual wield becomes the best option. Not much hit gear while leveling.
---
Only tanks where plate. EVERYONE ELSE GET YOUR CLOTH AND LEATHER AND GET YOUR ASS IN THIS VOLCANO.
---
Haha nah man if I'm not enjoying retail in the first month and no beta I wont go full hog.
---
Majority of load times in wow always came from addons.
---
Well, we've got bags and herbs. Good group so far!
---
And I didn't mean to come off like I'm putting down hardcore players or anything. Whatever everybody enjoys doing!
---
Ive been feeling that way kinda for a while.  Was having some fun here and there in BfA, but im just kinda 'eh' on it at this point.
---
Though im pretty sure that while Classic is a big part of it, the fact that its getting close to summer is also a huge part of it.  Ive been spending time fishing, doing some other hobbies (homebrewing), etc lately and its actually been really nice.
---
Hoping to have a nice summer of that sort of stuff before i start playing wow a biiiiiiiiiit too much this fall :P
---
Can we get a new report option for 'Pointless stream clips'?
---
Honestly this makes me laugh. I applied to his guild and he ignored me for a month then basically told me I wasn‚Äôt good enough. I had a pretty long ‚Äúresume‚Äù too as a guy who actually played vanilla as a top tier raider and pvper. But I suspect he doesn‚Äôt want actual vanilla players as it would expose him as a private realm baby only. It pissed me off too he got all his buddies beta invites too.
---
Another great twitch clip.
---
Engineering is the master race of professions. You use iron or thorium grenades which can be cast while running. Requires you to predict where they will be 2 second later but gives you another stun. (honestly I forget how long of a cast time it has)
---
Ok, that sounds like a very similar situation except I‚Äôm 100% sure  the account I have active is my original since it has the actual account name instead of ‚Äúwow1,wow2 ‚Äú etc.
---
Yeah, like nobody is gonna flood the AH with wand in classic at start, you'll outsmart them all.
---
I have made some [adjustments](https://s.put.re/QykVEGG3.jpg) if you don't mind.
---
It was limited to a few servers I think. I always found it really dumb when people would try to on our server, and nobody would ever join in. But I'm pretty sure they did that because of other servers.
---
clip chimp
---
I suppose its a valid point in the eyes of a 12 y/o with a grudge on Blizzard because he doesn't have $15 to pay for a chance to get in the beta.
---
He had Res Sickness
---
He played in vanilla, just not to endgame...
---
That is fair.
---
But the game is going to be changed regardless, just by virtue of it being a port of a newer version.
---
Listen at this point I'll take some changes over fucking BFA so I guess I'm just in that mindset.
---
Thank you
---
Just give me your definition of rushing to end game and I will be more than happy to provide you with evidence that a majority of players are going to be taking their time. You are really getting caught in semantics by the way. If you can give me a direct quote where OP is being pervasive or pedantic, I would love to hear your explanation.
---
&gt; Have I? Are you sure? Because unless you were actually right and I need my money back from whomever taught me, intentionally being a dick towards others is kinda the opposite of showing respect.
---
Your perceptions are so warped.
---
&gt; Then why would you?
---
No more justification is needed beyond "you want to."
---
&gt; Again, you're I would like to reiterate, YOU are the one trying to force people to play a game how YOU want them to play it.
---
If you believe that this game, or any game for that matter, is personally about you, I don't know what to tell you.
---
**^(L)**ets **^(A)**ssume  **^(Y)**ou  **^(E)**at  **^(R)**aw  **^(I)**guana  **^(N)**uts  **^(G)**ratuitously
---
So you haven't experienced the wall of no first hand.
---
Retail players have put us down for over a decade.
---
RISE UP GAMERS!!!
---
Overpower only procs on dodges, not misses.  Hit chance is different than dodge/parry; those are governed by weapon skill, the level of your target, and which direction they are facing.
---
Without dual wielding, characters only have a bass miss chance of 5%, while dual wielding adds an additional 19%, for a total of 24% miss chance for each weapon.  At low levels, without vital +hit gear, the tradeoff isn't worth it.
---
With that said, the miss chance only applies to white hits (auto attacks) not special attacks, so rogues aren't as hurt by it as they have a spammable attack with either sinister strike or backstab.  Warriors rely on their auto attacks to generate rage, so it hurts them WAY more than rogues.
---
Feenix. Emerald Dream here
---
You mean Tauren being able to hit people about 12ish yards away on Beta? Yes it's a bug. That's been on the "hot" list of bugs to talk about so that's why I say it will get fixed.
---
Tauren have a larger hitbox but right now it's insane. During Vanilla their hitbox wasn't an issue and it won't be in the future.
---
You have a section of the Pservers people on this subreddit that is completely retarded. And no, I'm not hating on Pservers. It's just a sad fuck.
---
These people are salty as fuck, they are toxic as fuck and they hate everything that has sucsess. And because of this, they will twist everything into hate. Sad, but true.
---
Ironic using Athene's name and calling someone else a sheep.
---
Considering how everyone‚Äôs been pointing out this is official and there are/have been multiple stickies talking about this being official... it is that crazy
---
I got downvoted to hell when I asked someone to stop posting twitch clips on another post. Hopefully this one will help my cause.
---
Maybe he did. But he definitely didn‚Äôt play much if so because his guides are so off. He just sounds like a private realm player.
---
I‚Äôve been cycling through my hand-held games, my PlayStation games and my pc games. I can only play for about half an hour til I get bored and find myself thinking of classic.
---
Can you post how Classic performs on your potato?
---
I wanted to open a thread but for whatever reason the mod is mental about system req threads - despite the fact that we are in beta already.
---
Nah dude I'm sure they invited them out, all expenses paid, to a day with the devs and to be shown the latest build in the blizzard offices because they thought all the top twitch streamers just happened to be expert beta testers/bug finders. Yup that must be it.
---
But fitting
---
should rename the subreddit to /r/tipsout
---
A quick Google search can answer that.
---
Good you can have the handicap mount parking
---
Nah no hate here. Never been a hardcore never want to be cause I like my hair lol. The stress of pushing that #1 or rank 15 pvp isn‚Äôt my style lol. Just get me in for the experience of leveling with some friends, at the end game lets face roll some bosses and have a good time.
---
I implore all of you. Play however the fuck you want if it makes you happy.
---
Guess I'll go human paladin to smite you
---
Of course it was.
---
Mirror: https://streamable.com/8o7ou
---
NA, true.
---
I wish i could be sure, it's tough not knowing when you want too. damn my memory, damn it.
---
If you‚Äôre trying to imply that‚Äôs me then well played sir. Bazinga haha lmao I concede
---
Wrongly was not used correctly in your reply.
---
Talked with acctual GM today because I was about to refund sub, he said that being subscribed is 100% needed to have a chance to get picked for beta
---
I kinda want to go on his server specifically because I'm going alliance and want to camp this dude lol
---
Which was apparently them just copying the same optimizations Blizzard used originally rofl.
---
Just like ElvUI, only scrubs used it
---
So is it based on account Age? Mine is from January 2006.
---
It's almost like this is a beta test and there's possibly going to be bugs related to new technologies being introduced and thus people are going to be testing the game to see if and when those bugs occur. What a weird concept.
---
I feel like layering, and indeed sharding systems in general on modern wow, really need to take into consideration the state of combat of a player and not transition them while in combat or allow them to be transitioned with a cooldown period post-leaving combat. Would fix a lot of these issues.
---
I thought you meant the bug that's in Beta with Tauren being able to hit folks and be hit from 12y out.
---
Everyone has been complaining about it.
---
Well, crap. This is exactly what makes world content such ass in retail.
---
Fight a tough mob to low health only for him to disappear.  Clear an area of dense, aggressive mobs only for them to suddenly all reappear at once.
---
Blizzard really, really better get this right or Classic is no deal for me.  I'd rather deal with empty realms and merges down the road, than play the game knowing this crap could happen at any time.
---
Sharding 2.0 needs to be *invisible* to players, period.
---
vErDaN tHe EverLiVinG dOeS wAy ToO mUcH dAmAgE
---
Smite isn't a paladin spell. You'd need to be a priest for that.
---
Why doesn‚Äôt anyone bring up how amazing The Burning Crusade was? That was honestly the peak of WoW for me and everything after that has drastically watered the game down.
---
Ye it‚Äôs a shame undead and/or PvP trinket don‚Äôt make you invulnerable to seduction
---
Wait
---
Later on, when you get better gear, DW might be worth, but while leveling, unless you somehow get godly 1H weapons, it's better to 2H.
---
Always human.  Never not human.  Too many people just love playing humans.
---
I'm pretty sure this is sarcasm, like he doesn't actually believe that. I've never followed him before but from 2 days of streaming it's safe to say he's usually not the top warrior in his own WC group.
---
You just picked my new main.
---
In the worst case people hoping for an invite will blow $45 for three months of sub and never get one. I suspect at some point, probably halfway through, Blizzard will cave to the negativity a bit and start inviting masses of people who resubbed in the huge wave right after the beta announcement. Even if they don't, I mean, in the grand scheme, there are folks out there that spent a whole lot more for a whole lot less on "early access" scams.
---
For myself, I don't really mind waiting until August, and since I never played Vanilla anyway I kinda want to be able to start fresh with the game on launch day, which is when they hype and crowds will be truly off the charts. That's the part I'm excited for, and I'm also ok with re-subbing a couple of weeks ahead to get the early access for name reservations.
---
That said, if they told me I could pay $15-20 for a guaranteed beta invite, I'd probably go for that just because. But for just getting a chance of an invite, which based on my past beta experience with this game is super unlikely, I'm not so moved.
---
I'm in the same boat. I'd like to see someone post screenshots of how long they've been unsubbed and if they have access to the beta. I'm getting the general idea that you don't need to be subbed to get an invite, but you will need to be in able to login. Right now I have no substantial evidence pointing either way and the Blizzard CS screenshots also leave things for debate.
---
No r/twitchclips
---
okay.... and?
---
That is what blizzard wants you to think
---
Happenstance is a thing.
---
Also this isn't the same thing as that other clip where 2 guardsmen just spawned in out of nowhere.
---
The monster here isn't randomly phasing in and out, it's moving across some kind of invisible barrier and something is happening.
---
No you don't have to watch them.
---
I was pointing to the sub as pervasive and pedantic, also rushing to 56 ish then grinding bis till 60. Also if it‚Äôs a poll from this sub that‚Äôs not really proof, indicative but far from proof
---
Hunter thanks to Huntards
---
Warlock due to class fantasy
---
Shamans, particularly enh, because it's boring
---
I resubbed, went to MC kill garr in hope of my last binding and logged out after. üòÅ
---
&gt; but to say it's going to kill retail wow is just disingenuous
---
Is anybody really saying that? Is that even the point of classic WoW?
---
Yuo don't need a sub. but you do need active game time. albeit  from a sub you canceled that had time left on it. a game token. any
---
We already had videos, guides, addons and ethics to use or not those thing. You need stuff, reputation and a Raid Leader; A real one, that is able to manage 39 peoples ! And the same 39 peoples for all your tries.
---
You know the fights, right; but there were no margin. Your tank was light on HP, your healers were lacking mana and your dps needed to be flawless. Even with descent stuff. 
---
I don't think we'll see people rushing 60 and farm MC in a full pick-up raid in the first few months.
---
Vanilla.
---
/r/cringe
---
Not even remotely. If we're being generous, 30% the shown races at most are vanilla compatible.
---
Interesting, I thought that the Character Model thing would play far less of a role in Classic, especially due to the model/animations being so acccesable via Savory Delight
---
Is it possible to add a countdown somewhere?
---
It worked like that in TBC but not in vanilla.
---
absolutely what he meant!
---
Yes... My cunning plan to get people to play  healers is working...
---
OP didn't play on a pvp server.
---
:(
---
Mm yeah but it should it go before or after 'Question answered 6 months ago' and 'shit tier memes'?
---
Asmon is very skilled at what he does, entertainment and crowd pleasing. That's not a skill to take for granted. There's a reason he's so successful where so many have failed
---
Alexsensual and his community harassed Tipsout, even making death threats. Tipsout called the cops on Alexsensual. His community is still laughing about it, since death threats are super funny.
---
Who gives a fuck?
---
15 bucks ain‚Äôt shit. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not scummy. I would gladly pay once I got in, but for a chance it‚Äôs scummy
---
As u/Thesuppressivepeople said, a quick google search would you take you tonnes of videos with Ion and other blizzard employees discussing this (very briefly)
---
Although, personally I hope that they would implement some kind of poll system, just like the one that Old School RuneScape is using, where 75% of the playerbase has to vote yes for a new implementation.
---
I had a post about a similar situation.  Basically I know my original account from 2004 was merged into a newer Battle.net account around 2012.  Someone told me they have an original account from 2004 that was merged to a new Battle.net in 2015.  He had gotten a beta invite.
---
It appears they are using the age of the actual wow account not bnet account.
---
I did the exact same thing
---
Interesting. That makes me feel slightly more comfortable picking Dwarf/Gnome for my Warrior, despite the lacking in PvE they are far superior in PvP
---
So as of right now nothing has been confirmed. Devs has stated that they are going to wait for feedback regarding that and make the decision later on, but have said they aren't against the idea of (1) TBC/WotLK servers or (2) Classic+ servers where they will add brand new content to Classic (that isn't expansion content.)
---
I get it, better to understand ur enemy. 
---
Do you think a nice compromise would be to go enhancement until later phases when min maxing is more important?
---
My mistake  
---
Private servers were doing things not-rightly
---
Have you never subbed to a gaming subreddit? All different types of content gets submitted and the popular things get up votes. Just downvote and move on if you don't like it. If the majority agrees, then it'll go away. If not, go start your own subreddit with your own rules.
---
Seriously, it's a clip of a funny interaction. Who pissed in your Cheerios?
---
Yeah that's true. It also looks like they added the free days right after a subscription expired, and I paid for 6 months so it took longer to get my credits.
---
Sounds good to me! Maybe we can do one of my old 3-man Scarlet Monastery runs. Hint: It gets much, much worse before it gets better. Super fun, though!
---
Commented on the wrong thread, my bad bb
---
beautiful!
---
Are you kidding me this is the single most entertaining thing on the planet please let me watch it oh please
---
First off, I absolutely care about my server first thunderfury hand of rag and our scarab lord. 
---
That said, I couldn‚Äôt give a flying fuck about any other server.
---
Twitch is owned by Amazon. When you pay Twitch, you‚Äôre paying Amazon.
---
Even when you donate, the site they use takes a cut. It‚Äôs near impossible to give money to a streamer without a corporation taking a cut.
---
Again, what do you mean by "rushing"? Is there a time frame you are referring to?
---
Also, in your mind, what is proof? A peer reviewed scholarly journal on the playing styles for a game that hasn't been released? If you will not accept survey results from 20,000+ players who are going to be playing this game, can you please provide me the "proof" that the majority of players are in the same boat as you and your friends?
---
This is not layering? Or not what they explained layering was, anyway.
---
I guess. I love the in-game community that's for sure but most forums regarding classic over the last two years have become pretty unbearable at times.
---
LH?
---
I wouldn't get to upset yet, it's early in beta and this could be a bug.
---
If someone frequently dies mid-fight and you don't, then you're more valuable then them regardless what you play.
---
Not saying I agree with the way they are handling it, but when its the few things you are looking forward too, then principles go out the door.
---
I say bring it on. Soloing rares/higher level mobs is my jam.    
---
I'll just need to sharpen my blades more often ;)
---
25.5.2005 here üëã damn I just want to get iiiiinnn!!
---
There‚Äôs always a struggle before it gets easier as I‚Äôve come to understand from old videos lol. I‚Äôm down to put the old 4 dungeons of scarlet monastery on farm for that early set and possible tabard! I love the color scheme
---
I distinctly remember this being a thing back even as recently as Mists on my warrior back then. Guess that makes the question answered. Thanks!
---
Unpopular opinion: beta access should be a pure chance lottery and not weighted in any way by said "influencers" or content creators.
---
Ironically it does but he‚Äôs the sheep lol
---
Wait what. Madseasons is Joe Pera the guy from Adult Swim?
---
Someone isn't all-knowing:
---
TRIGGERD.
---
Outrage culture, get the fuck out.
---
This is an ignorant way to look at things.
---
running a balanced raid is much better for ‚Äúloot efficiency.‚Äù
---
A lot of pserver kids insist on running 9 warriors and only 2 hunters but don‚Äôt acknowledge the fact that an under-geared fury warrior will under perform against even a meme spec if they have sufficient gear.
---
Assuming a balanced loot drop distribution, running way more of one class will stunt the loot progression of the guild as a whole, and in turn can actually make progression SLOWER (I.e.  if you bring 9 warriors 2 hunters but get way more  hunter drops you are going to have a really geared hunter Corp, but the raid group only has 2 slots gaining loot progression)
---
Furthermore, some loot is not itemized well for ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù specs, (finkles comes to mind) so running no funky specs leads to some loot going un-utilized, compounding the problems mentioned above.
---
Gaming limbo is the worst. Tonight is the start if a new Diablo 3 season with a neat gimmick of LoN set bonus for free... hopefully that will give me something to do while reloading launcher.
---
Any human with a brain that plays this game will disagree with this post in general. Being friendly has literal nothing to do with ‚ÄúWoW Classic‚Äù. Nothing in WoW live prevents this from happening.
---
Yeah, the entire backend software is by mangos/cmangos, and private realms just piggyback onto those projects and do some additional bug fixes and changes. Also, there is the guy(s) who painstakingly went through every single item to make the databases used with the backend projects (like UDB, TBCDB).
---
Area man looking forward to playing fantasy mmorpg calls people ‚Äúmoonguard losers‚Äù
---
Well, the Classic patch is right after rogues are brought more in line with other classes, so they won't be the gods of pvp that some of these videos showcase.
---
World of Roguecraft does a fantastic job explaining it.
---
I would never choose a race specifically to min/max my dude.  The benefits are far too small for a game that basically locks you into what you choose day one.  For example, I want to play a hunter for pvp... I know dwarf is probably the best in terms of actually fighting because stoneskin is OP as HELL against rogues and shadowpriests and melee in general...  But I just like the look of nightelves way too much to roll a dwarf.  Plus I'm super casual and will have to afk a lot so shadowmeld will save me
---
Tell me if you get in today. I think no invites on Weekend. But if you get in, my chance is maybe high to get in before weekend.
---
Every Sunday at 1400 in Booty Bay/STV only. Be the first to catch and turn in 40 (I think it was 40) Tasty Fish.
---
Thats pretty cool to know! I'm sure there's plenty of situations where that extra melee range could be applicable.
---
The shading on that orc tho!!!
---
It doesnt matter what they like to do. What matters is that this is new content to them. So *some* of them will probably want to take their time to immerse themselves.
---
Must have been by server as on Tich and Llane we didn't use VC.
---
True, the thing is I distinctly remember when passing through zones the text that pops up in the middle of your screen matches the category of danger associated to that zone. Green, yellow and red.
---
Sounds like some communist propaganda to me but ok...
---
Really depends on your server.
---
Don't act like you get out of the house much. Video games and underachieving are your specialty!
---
Also it doesn't come with email
---
You stupid moron didn't get the point I guess but what did I even expect.
---
I'll see if I can figure out how to link it, and whether or not it works, when I get home from work (about 2 hours from now).
---
Now this is ~~pod racing~~ beta testing!
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troglodyte_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)
---
You mean making actual friends and contacts to do more runs in the future
---
He also didn‚Äôt get to loot the corpse so if you were doing say 20 Zehra hooves you‚Äôd be fucked AND dead. You shouldn‚Äôt get phased/layered for at least 30 seconds after combat ends. That‚Äôs what I would say.
---
Absolutely not true. Most people who will rush to 60 have already done it many times over on pservers and know the drill.
---
Yep
---
It‚Äôs that easy??? Wow thanks!
---
Who the fuck are you replying to? Do you know how to use reddit?
---
&gt; No more justification is needed beyond "you want to."
---
Buy *why* would you want to? If you can't articulate that, then you clearly haven't put any thought into it, essentially arbitrarily choosing, so why not arbitrarily choose something that wont cause you to be a dick to other people?
---
&gt; If you believe that this game, or any game for that matter, is personally about you, I don't know what to tell you. 
---
I don't? What makes you think I think that?
---
Both my 60s in Vanilla were on the furballs in Winterspring. My first 60 was off the level 58 big guys on the mountainside near the chief's cave. My second 60 was one of the lower level camps near the entrance, hugging the northwest mountains.
---
Hmmm might actually do that. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Thank you for your brief anwser!
---
That second choice would be actually cool!
---
I get the analogy but really hope Blizzard did not actually make it that stupidly simple.
---
The system needs to start filling cup 2 *before* cup 1 is full.  And cup 3 before 2.  Etc.  If they have to shuffle players after they're in their layers, they've designed it wrong. :(
---
Or you know...just removing. It after a few weeks like they said they‚Äôd do.
---
No it is the point dude, he points to his way as fun and the other as to not.......................
---
Is it considered a boxing match if someone sucker punches someone in a "game" of knock out? I wont tell anyone how to enjoy their game, by all means if it gives you goosebumps to kill someone who cant fight back, well at least your not doing it in real life.              
---
              
---
Massive world PVP, very cool. City invasions, top tier. Winning a BG, best of the best. One shotting a lvl 19, yeah enjoy that weak sauce shit.
---
We only started seeing these issues after a server restart.  There is a good chance blizz did something to try and test their layering, so it stands that some weird stuff is going to happen.
---
Earlier on stream he said he only got to lvl 51 in vanilla so yes his experience is mostly from pservers.
---
&gt;You're the one responding. Don't cry too much!
---
There wouldn‚Äôt be any content left on the sub then.
---
Someone who is apparently respected by the streamers told McConnel to give them his battlenet id and they'd get him in the beta and McConnell turned it down saying it wasnt right and Asmon told him to swallow his pride and McConnell still refused, saying that if he gets in fair and square then so be it. 
---
Also, he told asmon that they're basically just free advertisement used to gain viewers, which isn't exactly a hot take, but to say it on Asmon's stream for all of his viewers was kinda cool.
---
Yup. Invincibility and healing are great and all but all those cooldowns took forever and you basically had to just auto-attack everything to death. Slow and boring.
---
Me rage quitting? Haha, you really don't know who you are talking to.
---
You missed with your shots =)
---
The GM of that server gave Tips 2k extra hp lol funny thing is he doesn't even know this. On top of that hes popping rocket boots and recklessness every duel‚Ä¶ (cooldowns reset every duel on that server hes talking about)
---
And iirc it was a CD for a long time. I remember always saving it for Vann.
---
&gt;Can't replicate moonwalking. 
---
Classic experience ruined
---
Yikes
---
For the Horde, always. Plan for now is to start the grind by myself. Will be playing a Tauren Druid.
---
you seem like a nice guy.
---
That's pretty damning.
---
&gt; Buy why would you want to? If you can't articulate that, then you clearly haven't put any thought into it, essentially arbitrarily choosing, so why not arbitrarily choose something that wont cause you to be a dick to other people?
---
...because it's a video game, and people can play it in any way they see fit.  Again, this could all be cleared up if you provided me with the official "how to play WoW" book you seem to have.
---
&gt; I don't? What makes you think I think that?
---
You just said you believe you have the authority to tell other people how to play the game and that deviations from this are personal affronts to you.
---
Yeah, but the Thunderfury meme wasn't around til TBC or later.
---
I wish I could upvote more than once.
---
I had an Ati 9600 Pro. I got about 10 fps in Ironforge at 1024x768. Loved every frame!
---
Definitely well deserved, it's not often you come across someone taking time of their day to write informative walls of text for someone who clearly doesn't have a very good grasp of the topic at hand.
---
Have a good week too, friend. Hope to see you in Azeroth soon.
---
Oh! And the dagger! And the orb! And I wanna say a wand, too? And even the walk getting there is an adventure.
---
They have said they are considering doing BC + WOTLK as well, and they also said they are considering adding fresh content to Classic WoW. Came out with the info drop Tuesday.
---
&gt; and I asked him if SoR triggered procs when I interviewed him on Countdown to Classic's podcast - the reality is that he doesn't remember for sure as it has now been over 15 years
---
So? We reminded him that it did and he agreed that because of the unique way in which they were programmed behind the scenes *it was never intended to replace SotC as the proccing seal.*
---
Yeah, just a little wait until August 27th now and we can stop hanging around here. Really looking forward to it!
---
In the real world people have to follow the rules, not his fault you have trouble acting civil and respectful.
---
Quiet, Savage!!!
---
I'm pretty sure Esfand played since the beginning of vanilla. He said he moved over from Everquest.
---
If you ONLY heal, then go priest. They are the best healers in vanilla, while leveling and max level.
---
I started in wotlk. Tried a pserver to see what the hype for vanilla was about. Had an absolute blast leveling a warrior and then classic was announced. Now I wait patiently for release.
---
Yeah I didn't use Cosmos at all. I used CT mod pack i think that had bars and stuff
---
This is soo true!!
---
I tried another computer &amp; it's fine, for some reason.
---
Zone text on Classic beta is not coloured. 
---
Take Elewyn forest for example, you finish the premilnery quests and head to Goldshire. When you reach Goldshire the text that pops up in the middle of your screen should be green like the colour of the zone represented in the top right mini-map. Instead on the Classic beta the text is white but mini-map is green.
---
(Sams goes for hostile areas: red and neutral:yellow)
---
I‚Äôll be in STV tomorrow and will test this for you
---
Yep. Slow Fall + Blink = One-Way Elevator.
---
And this one?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultProtectivePlumPhilosoraptor
---
The mob he's fighting actually disappeared
---
Well Rogues used to be Bad = Good, Good = Great, Great = OP. Then it was brought down so skill level was equivalent to itself (Bad = Bad, Great = Great). But great Rogues are great for a variety of reasons, not just because of their damage, but because of their ability to think independently and play to the situation at hand. 
---
Your toolkit as a Rogue is enormous, second only to a Mage. If you want to go Engineering and just ambush people while they're unaware, then I think you're going to have a far more enjoyable time than just charging in as a (well-geared) Warrior.
---
PLEASE!!!
---
I love pvp, but I HATE stupid player names like `Xxmemelordxx` or all the `Youcantseeme` rogues.
---
Pluse, people are just generally more mature and willing to attack and defend world pvp on PVP/RP realms.
---
&gt;everyone really should be welcome.
---
Besides everyone I don't like.
---
Its what happens in ALL of these report systems, that why it should have to be done through a ticket so they at least have to put some effort in it.
---
Mass reporting without any accountability and through automated system is a cancer in the gaming community, and report should be either limited or require more effort to post, automated report on the character window is the stupidest system I've ever heard of.
---
[Then we can finally play the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg2PD-dwsIw)
---
Enhance is viable for leveling. It's quite good in pvp while leveling. If you can get BiS gear. In MC, you can rock people. It won't be because your a good class though. it will be because in classic wow. Gear&gt;Class and most won't have the gear.
---
That being said you will have to raid as resto. No one wants and enhance in their raid. Ele simply isn't viable for raiding because of mana and, enhance deals no damage.
---
If you wanna be a 2 handed smashing machine Warrior is just way better for that. Like I said in my original post though. One of the great things about classic is how much gear matters. With the right gear even your meme ass will level the average player. Most people will never have the BiS raid gear.
---
99% of the people planning of being raid BiS will fail. Classic has a tendency to wear down min maxxers. So as long as you are playing what you love. You will generally still be able to crush the average man. Because you will work harder then he will.
---
The biggest warning I will give you for a Shaman though is that you will be raiding resto. Unless you are in a super casual guild. Even then though you will still prolly have to play resto.
---
The "phasing / Layering" in vanilla supports up to an entire server population. Do you really think they just happened to invite 3-4000 people and they all logged in at the same time causing some weird layering malfunctions?
---
Thank you. If you‚Äôre able to stream it and/or need helping finding the spot, send me the link and I‚Äôll join chat to help
---
Don't worry dude my account started on the 12/2/2005 and I have an active sub at the moment and still no beta! hopefully we all get one sooner or later.
---
&gt; Those moments you are looking for are located in a different place now, but they still exist. 
---
They do still exist. Many just prefer the time when they were all around the place. Leveling 1-60 in Vanilla, 1-70 in TBC, or 1-80 in WotLK, you literally had to make a couple friends at a time or an other, and talk with people regularly. And that's just leveling, not even specific content. Not the case anymore.
---
&gt; Complaining about BFA being too easy and refuse to actually try and complete the difficult content - is just a clear example of manifesting your own narrative - it‚Äôs just very dogmatic to exclude portions of a game to criticize it. 
---
I think there aren't many people on this thread denying that hard mode retail's PvE is tough as nails. The big issue is that it's the only thing you can make that argument about. Literally all the rest is braindead. Leveling, getting gear, questing, leveling professions, dungeons/raids (easy mode) ... These things are the backspine of the game, Mythic content isn't.
---
One thing that shocked me in Cata was that they took away Arena Rating requirements to get PvP gear. Back in BC and LK, you had to have a certain Arena Rating to be able to buy an item, ranging from 750 (bracers) to 1950 (MH/2H weapons) (iirc). But they decided to take that away to give people who aren't able to invest time into Arena the ability to get the same gear easily. Why ? This was pathetic, and made half of players just join v2 with a random guy found on the /2 of any city to get "arena points of the week". 
---
So suddenly, the gear I had taken time, effort and cooperation to obtain in previous expansions is now freely given to anybody, because why not. And I heard in BfA they give the Gladiator title to anybody reaching 2k4 mmr and winning a couple matches ! Terrible. This is just an example, but it just goes to show how dumbed down and unrewarding the game feels to many people.
---
This wasn't on a zone boundary 
---
I am JUST talking about Acti-Blizzard. And it sounds like you agree with me that the business people do indeed push potentially bad decisions...
---
This is a pretty absurd claim and I can tell by his tanking that he isn't a top pvper.  However this subreddit gives him a bit more shit than he deserves.  His classic hype and play is 10x more legitimate than half of the other streamers i've been forced to watch these last few days.
---
I bought a WoW token with half my remaining gold from last time I played. I don't plan on ever playing retail again, so fuck it.
---
OmG LiKe WhY dOeS EvErYoNe nOt ThInK LiKe Me. I hAtE StReAmErS ThEy DoNt PrOvIdE Me aNy eNjOymeNt So ThEy sHoUlDnT ExiSt.

Yo this is really good.
---
Oof
---
It was the one that everybody knows about, and the one that matters most, for obvious reasons.
---
Why the fuck would you wish something like this? That's absolutely selfish. I don't play BFA but I'm sure there are tons that do. Grow up
---
McConnell the Flavor Flave/Lil John of WoW steamers. I‚Äôve only ever seen him in the back ground of other Streamers hyping them up and dropping ‚ÄúTwitch Prime‚Äù bombs. Not a diss at all btw. I think he does well at what he does. I just hope they cut him in on the dollar dollar bills. 
---
Yeeeeah Boi! WHAT?!? Okay!
---
Hopefully shadowunitframe gets updated. I still use it on retail haha.
---
is it considered \_content creator\_ ?
---
Hey, want to know a secret?
---
All those characters that you were going to be putting time and effort and love and sweat and tears into during classic this fall?
---
In 14 years they will be right back at Battle for Azeroth. Happy face!
---
what aan epic meme!!! upvoted haha :))))
---
I've been on the same RPPVP server since 2005 and although I don't RP, I enjoy the immersion of other people doing it and also I feel that the community is generally, slightly more mature and respectful on RP servers.
---
What if I told you, Vanilla is just the prequel to Burning Crusade
---
Except it's not BFA, it's Legion code
---
I feel you man. Used to be I could just log 4-6 he's a day on hots/D2 but now I just find myself staring at the main menu wishing I could play classic.
---
Seems like the mobs respawned
---
Shoot for a classic 31/20/0 build for leveling. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSMzefQNA_AdDAA
---
For the weapon spec in arms, go with whatever your race exceeds at. Axe is the most common because crit is super important, but don't discount sword. I never messed with mace back in the day until Burning Crusade (when it was god mode) but a chance on hit 3 second stun could be good. Research the 2 handers you may encounter on the leveling journey and spec into what you want.
---
Any useful ones like that will either be updated  or have brand new versions with the same functionality. Addons aren't hard to make, and Classic will be popular. There's no chance at all things like swing timers/CC timer/UI addons somehow won't exist.
---
Same thing happens to Pservers in the exact spot and, all along the river
---
Maybe.  But again, beta.  Report it so it can get fixed and move on.  Whining about it won't make it better.

Uses a private server database for a patrol path, spends one hour going back and forth up the patrol path without finding the messenger, then gets triggered and deduces that it must be "bugged" even though he didnt even bother to check other places outside his private server database. If blizzard pays attention to these types of reports we'll be playing a private server experience 3 months later
---
Haha that's really funny!
---
 what aan epic meme!!! upvoted haha :)))) omg more like this my lord

ah fuck

The glow is barely visible, otherwise neat.

Soda 100% goes on a PvP realm

Endgame raiding and PvP

Gold farming

And my favorite past time when phase 3 hits, fucking twinking to my heart's content.
---
I feel you bud, I just stare at my PC cycling between games.
---
Pretty sure you can already
---
Almost positive almost every streamer that got invite played Vanilla. Not that it should or does matter.
---
100 percent. I want classic for the end game.
---
As a shaman main from bc to mid legion, I'm stealing this.
---
Really surprised they would want to play with us lol
---
Everyone has not played on pervers. Most people have not played on pservers. Most WoW Classic customers will not have beaten this content.
---
I can't actually say it without it getting deleted. It's a vanilla private server
---
I typically level 1h/shield to 10(the 2h weps are trash and you have to buy the training) once I hit 10-15 I swap to 2h and level 2H fury till I hit 40 then respec to arms for MS. 
---
Leveling will be slow and painful if you don‚Äôt duo level with a class that can heal. Level cooking and first aid to help minimize downtime for solo leveling.
---
&gt; under-geared fury warrior will under perform against even a meme spec if they have sufficient gear.
---
If you're talking fresh 60 undergeared vs naxx geared, then perhaps, in certain situations, but as long as they're even remotely close then you're simply wrong.
---
&gt; but the raid group only has 2 slots gaining loot progression
---
And by the laws of *math* putting gear on one person is better for the guild than spreading it out.
---
&gt; Furthermore, some loot is not itemized well for ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù specs, (finkles comes to mind) so running no funky specs leads to some loot going un-utilized, compounding the problems mentioned above.
---
This is some strange logic right here, how is putting gear on a person who does worse with it better than having a person who performs better without the gear?
---
thank you for the psa
---
Right, like they said. Unfortunately we only have their word for now.
---
And we've only experienced this kind of thing since CRZ / sharding.  This isn't the same as fast respawns.  This is an entire area possibly "respawning" on you at once.  Or having to wait and kill a named monster a 2nd time because it disappeared.  Consequences of poorly designed sharding.
---
New and exciting information.
---
&gt; This isn't true. /who is not real-time accurate, for one. For two, addons can communicate with each other directly. They could simply sync up to poll /who at the same time.
---
Fair enough. That alone is also sufficient to prove that my next statement (amount of guesswork increasing with population) is incorrect, although your other point regarding that is fair as well.
---
&gt; Where is this faith coming from?
---
From the many updates we have gotten, I believe the classic team is wholly dedicated to preserving the game as it was as much as possible within reasonable limits. Now, you can surely disagree with me on what is "reasonable" in that regard, but so far every compromise they have made that will make the game slightly different than how it was is, *in my opinion*, reasonable. That doesn't mean I personally *like* all of them - in fact I don't - but I don't find them unreasonable decisions that make me question their dedication to making classic authentic. 
---
&gt; I had faith in no changes, then faith in "sharding for only the first zones in the first week of launch," and now they want us to have faith in worldwide layering for an entire phase?
---
I think taking everything they have said without binding verbage is a bit silly. Obviously the game was never going to be an exact 1:1 carbon copy of Vanilla. I could back that up with several things, but I think the most obvious is recreating each patch from release up til 1.1; starting at 1.12 alone throws "no changes" out the door. Why would they have made the other choice of planned obsolescence when they stated shortly after the initial announcement that they did not want to simultaneously manage 2 mmos? 
---
Regarding sharding during the first few weeks of launch, that was a hugely controversial (or divisive at the very least) topic amongst the community which is precisely why they are now planning to use layering. They responded to the community's concerns, and now there are new concerns about this system. Do you see how this is kind of a catch-22? They want to do right by the classic community and show us that they take our concerns seriously, but when they respond with an alternative, that upsets a different part of the community. They are never going to come to a solution that everyone is satisfied with. Because of that, I think there is a responsibility on the sides of both the developers and the community: the developers should make the decisions that they think will deliver the most authentic experience, and the community should temper their expectations of every detail of how that is carried out.
---
All that being said, I am not telling you to have faith in the classic team. I'm not trying to convince you to be satisfied with the information we've been given so far, I'm simply explaining why I am satisfied and not particularly concerned.
---
&gt; This has long-term economic impacts.
---
Sure, I'm not denying that. But to what degree and for how long those impacts last will depend greatly on how long the system is in place and how easy or difficult it ends up being to abuse. If it truly ends up being only a few weeks, I don't foresee it having significant long term consequences. Again, you can continue to disagree; but it's not like I haven't considered the possibility of long-term consequences, it's just not something I see as a great risk. 
---
&gt; It also shows that developers are willing to compromise on past promises. They've said no sharding for AQ, so how much longer before they tell us layering for AQ?
---
You lost me there. On what promise have they compromised? Sharding? Correct me if I'm wrong, but their statements about sharding did not seem like a promise or binding in any way (other than that, if implemented, it would be temporary) but rather a "this is our idea for the path forward at this point in time" type of thing. Perhaps there is something else I missed, but the sharding thing never seemed like it was a finalized solution to me. 
---
&gt; Putting faith that the devs won't ruin classic WoW by turning it into modern WoW is something that we all got burnt by once - with the original classic WoW.
---
I would argue that it had nothing to do with community faith - as there has always been very little, from the very beginning - and everything to do with trying to turn WoW into a game for everyone with the end result being a game for no one. Of course not literally a game for no one as people still play modern WoW, but significantly fewer than played it during Vanilla through WotLK. But my point is that they changed fundamental aspect after fundamental aspect to appeal to a wider audience and it backfired, and now the game appeals to a narrower audience. That happened because of poor foresight and had nothing to do with community faith in the developers. 
---
&gt; I'm not handing out my faith so freely.
---
I don't fault you for that! Believe me, although I say I have faith in the classic team, I am trying to remain cautiously optimistic. Like I said, I am not unconcerned with each piece of information we have been given so far. I'm certain the game is going to be noticeably different in some ways, but based on what I know now, I don't foresee it being a disappointment for me. I'm sure different things about the game have different importance to us, so I don't think it's unreasonable to be hesitant to have faith in them.
---
It would also be great if at some point they merged into one, or if they could all use the same AH
---
ya unfortunately it isn't in the scope of the Beta.
---
I'd still argue that it was a feature so long as Blizzard didn't forcefully remove the pet from players.  Much like how OP broken tooth and other tamables are, this one is just unique in its own way.
---
Hi, /u/hotpotato70
---
I strive to be one of the pallys that do.
---
This happens with every single game nowadays
---
Smash fans whine
---
Rdr2 online
---
Cod
---
Overwatch
---
Csgo
---
Every single games‚Äô fanbase complains theres nothing to do after playing it for months.
---
You already can. /join world or whatever chat your server likes to join if they are willing.  
---
Channels were always a thing since Vanilla. They just have the classic preset local channels.
---
Ohh okay gotcha. Thanks!
---
Warrior though gets huge benefit from races though, Gnome allows them to have a total of 3 (4 if including LAP) root escapes. That is huge Vs Mage.
---
Dwarf makes Warrior Leveling alot easier, preventing alot of unneeded deaths, as well as being super useful Vs rogue post 30! STV being easier is never a bad thing.
---
Human is just very PvE strong though, but I feel that the damage increase is so minor in anything but a hardcore guild, going human is a waste!
---
Pretty much just check every 'general goods' or 'trade goods' vendor in any new town you get to.   About half will have a new cooking recipe for you.
---
Well, at the end of the day this is beta. This is their largest technological feat, so I‚Äôm sure they are monitoring the situation very closely and will take the beta tester‚Äôs feedback.
---
They seriously don‚Äôt want to be causing people to die by layering.
---
Im playing my switch and mtg: arena
---

---
The only collector's I bought. But it seems as if I registered my account on the 12th.
---
This is exactly how I am interpreting it as well. There are n different times they will select players for the invite wave. If you are not subbed during that selection period, you will not receive an invite during said wave.
---
&gt; ...because it's a video game, and people can play it in any way they see fit.
---
So they can, but apparently I can't, now that's some next level hypocrisy you've got going on there.
---
&gt;  Again, this could all be cleared up if you provided me with the official "how to play WoW" book you seem to have.
---
Okay, here it is: Have fun and don't be a dick to others.
---
&gt; You just said you believe you have the authority to tell other people how to play the game and that deviations from this are personal affronts to you.
---
I literally said the opposite, repeatedly, but okay, fair enough. Maybe you're the one who needs his tuition back, since apparently you can't read.
---
Yes, it was 100% chance to get crit when sitting. The problem is that getting crit by sitting down didn't trigger effects that occurred when being crit. This behavior wasn't added until TBC (which when this video was made, it was the TBC pre-patch, not 1.12, rampage as the 41 point talent in the Fury tree, which.. obviously... pre-TBC didn't have 41 point talents).
---
/sit to force crit effects have been disproven already, it was only a private server thing and in retail only with later versions post-vanilla, so posting about it is just making you look dumb.
---
PSA: Posting nothing new or relevant. :)
---
Not leveling a warrior if I can't taunt critters and force them to crit me for blood craze and enrage
---
Do you need an active WoW subscription to get into WoW classic beta?
---
If it's like that it just makes it trivially easy to layer hop. Mine all the ore in yours, then say...  
---
      
---
1. UnGoro: LF Someone Layer 2 for group - paying 2g.  
---
Then do the ore run again in another layer. Sound good to you?
---
Good luck doing that with his fanboy bodyguards protecting him instead of enjoying their own experiences
---
That was great!
---
Be ready for some elitist attitudes in vanilla. We had a prot paladin in vanilla(not a private server), and I was a feral druid. Both of us offtanked a large portion of the raid content, and tanked every 5 man dungeon in the game with no issue. That said, you notice I said offtank. With the exception of Jin'do the Hexxer, I never main tanked any boss in a raid as feral, and even then that was just due to my immunity to polymorph. If your goal is to main tank any raid, you need to be a warrior. If that is not your goal, and you're fine with healing often as needed, then enjoy paladin! They are a lot of fun in pvp too.
---
I don't understand. If Paladin is a "heal/buff bot", isn't a mage/lock just a "damage bot"? Not worth the time investment unless you like to dps. Same goes for any other class in raids, really.
---
Yeah on N****Dale there are always 3 or 4 people north of the Port.  I farmed a level on the turtles there (skinning + cooking is good for turtle farming!) and there was a constant stream of semi-afk fishers doing god's work.
---
Godlike healers in pvp and pve, dps and tanking you can forget
---
Okay, work
---
It literally happened to like two people and all of a sudden it is "out of control".
---
This sub is a joke.
---
I think i'd tear something
---
The games always been grindy, it's just different parts, vanilla/tbc you ran dungeons/raids until you got what you wanted/needed. Retail now you don't just get that singular item, you have to have the exact stats (which are random) and the best ilvl (this was worse in Legion with everyone getting an artifact bs and certain ones boosting your dps by a shit ton, while the guys who knew how to play kept getting the ones that didn't boost dps).   
---
Another issue is, a lot things people want/do like are generally a pain. Warlocks having to farm for an extra hour getting soul shards, rogues making gathering herbs for their own poisons, hunters getting ammo (iirc the best was forged by an engineer so if you didn't pick that profession you were reliant to the AH or taking a dps loss). These don't sound too bad until you remember bags were crap in Vanilla, and things didn't stack. Warlocks needed a bag or two of Soul shards (because you need to hand out 20-40 healthstones and more) and because some abilities required it. 
---
Same goes for the hunter, who also needed extra food for his pet (I think it wasn't until BC that food buffed the pet as well but it was specialty food). The ammo would go into his ammo pouch/quiver which also gave a bonus to attack speed iirc but again running out was a pain because you had to make people wait on you to get more. This wasn't always bad, my biggest greviance about hunter was honestly remembering the pet had a chance at leaving you (which meant you had to go retrain another one, but honestly this aspect was cool cuz you learned ranks from other creatures in the wild rather than a trainer, this part i miss most about being a hunter).
---
Honestly I just wish bag space/stacking would be less of a problem in vanilla. Especially if you need to carry a second set of gear for off tanking/heals or switching out resis gear for certain fights.
---
Chrome remote desktop and remote to your computer.
---
My CTO got a beta invite today. Company gonna shut down for September /s
---
Rogues were still pretty great in BG's. Especially organised BG's they are fantastic flag takers and holders in AB.
---
and how about leveling up? is it easy ? Should i level up as retri?
---
Got it, thanks!
---
You're just assuming the Warlock never hits with Rain of Fire to pop the restealth.
---
it was implemented to reduce server costs and make merging servers easier
---
the fact that you think it was actually done to *improve* player experience is hilarious. LOL by your logic everyone would *want* layering if it didn't need to exist.
---
Ret and holy are both viable. Leveling is somewhat slow bust consistent
---
We are the ones that came back to it you moron. Quiet here.
---
I like how the map is a picture of a map...
---
You are 100% incorrect. Perhaps on your server, but in vanilla on my server Deadmines was always referred to as VC. Do not say things like always like you know how every server functioned in vanilla.
---
To be fair, RP-PvP wasn't introduced until 2005, so you are getting the 2004 experience.
---
My brother finally convinced me to start playing in 2005. He wanted us to roll on Arthas because a someone we knew IRL played there. My first time ever logging into the game I was met with a multi-hour queue. We peaced out and headed over to a brand new server called Lightninghoof and never looked back.
---
Its actually #nochanges because this shit happened in this very spot in Vanilla and on PServers. This isn't pashing, this is a "glitch" that happens on the zone line between two zones.
---
This very spot happened in Vanilla.
---
Vanilla wow claims another friendship. Let's us remember the dark side of classic.
---
This is what's scary about the Classic community. A significant amount of people have an overwhelming need for others to be angry over a video game.
---
There's more to life dude.
---
Yes, it was 100% chance to get crit when sitting. The problem is that getting crit by sitting down didn't trigger effects that occurred when being crit. This behavior wasn't added until TBC (which when this video was made, it was the TBC pre-patch, 2.0.1, not 1.12, rampage was the 41 point talent in the Fury tree, which.. obviously... pre-TBC didn't have 41 point talents). Even your 2nd' video says "Made December 20th", 2.0.1 was released December 5th. If you had done a LITTLE bit of research you wouldn't be here making an idiot out of yourself.
---
/sit to force crit effects in 1.12 vanilla have been disproven already, it was only a private server thing and in retail only with later versions post-vanilla, so posting about it is just making you look dumb.
---
I'm not sure why you are shouting that like it's something we should have known before.
---
Could you please show some gameplay to?
---
thank you for being so informative! 
---
What other classes/specs would fall into this same category? Because a dps feral Druid is the other thing I‚Äôm considering. 
---
The only reason I don‚Äôt want to play a warrior is because of how oversaturated it seems to be :(
---
This is not moonwalking :(
---
That is a rough mustache my dude.
---
He offered to give it back 5 minutes later. Epic streamer moment am I right?
---
LOL, what an a******.
---
Agreed. I'm sure plenty of people will mages. But yeah definitely not for everyone. I think that's an insightful comment about the knowing whether you'll like them. Different classes are definitely different with that, Druid for example you need access to all the wonderful versatility that is their strength and you don't really get that until 30 or 40. Sure you have cat form at 20, but you need to be 30ish to get enough of a mana pool and talents (and travel form helps a lot) to get an appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of each form.
---
For me it was ‚ÄúThe Rebirth‚Äù playing horde
---
THIS EXACT SPOT was a bug in Vanilla. Not saying layering hasn't been happening but THIS IS NOT IT.
---
My account is from 2007 but I didn‚Äôt get in. I think it‚Äôs just streamers right now. It would be a huge coincidence if asmongold swifty sodapoppin and others all just got access randomly.
---
!remindme 90 days
---
Yes, rather that than queues and unnecessary lag. You'll be okay.
---
They were def higher level than they needed to be. Imagine doing it at 16 (which was common) and aggroing mobs on the floor above you in the boat area just by being too low of a level. That dungeon is a cake walk when you have a group full of 18+.
---
Well you know they can't be classic streamers because the game does not exist since 2007
---
So classic
---
Twitch should really make a different category for Classic WoW just like OSRS did.
---
im going to play pala but if leveling is as hard as warrior i wont :D im not experienced wow player and i want something not very hard for level up. :) thats why im asking.
---
Keep furthering the Retail V Classic war(that doesn't exist). What are you helping by making posts like this, unreal...
---
ah fair enough
---
Leveling solo is a little painful but in a duo they shine
---
You should not ever die unless you are reckless. But you will kill slower than a lot of other classes solo. I‚Äôd suggest a leveling buddy. Paladins duo well. Rez/heals/buffs they are really geared towards group play for sure.
---
Actually I think that‚Äôs quite a popular opinion
---
But (like Blizzard) I also think that getting ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù or content creators in will help promote the game - and that to me is great as the more players in Classic, the better for its long term future
---
Same! I grinded there for hours on my warrior that I carried on to BC and Wrath
---

&gt; They're all open source
---
Really? Very few of them seem to have licenses, so how can you tell?
---
I already made the concession for skilled gameplay.  If you're deriving any of the rest of that from a streamer, especially one like Asmongold, then you should re-evaluate your life.
---
That's my opinion.  You don't have to like it.  Muting all of this :)
---
The developers have the table data for Regen rates. Why is this even contested?
---
I‚Äôve just done 1-14 on horde as a shaman, felt fine and actually less than on janky pservers.
---
Use the link the guy posted above. If you try to do it from US battle.net it doesn‚Äôt show everything.
---
I have conflicted feelings about this
---
RPPVP servers were alive and great in 1.12.   Give us true 1.12.   NO CHANGES
---
I think ret is the fastest way to level. Just straight up auto attacking and judging on cd. And then heal yourself between pulls.
---
I mean you are, but you seem to just be stating some inference. I'm using personal experience from a similar company to shift what I think the case actually is. I very much doubt any "business person" decided anything about flying. Except for probably keeping the aerial combat feature on the WotLK box art, even though the feature probably was still really iffy.
---
It wasn't patched out, it was patched in, in TBC. It never existed in Vanilla.
---
Weakauras is being worked on and you can make swing timers and overpower alerts with that, so you're covered.
---
I thought that was just me. I open up a game then close it, open another one and close it again. Then I come to this sub then see every single post is grey because I already read it. close my browser. open my phone and go onto this sub on mobile reddit then remember I already read all the posts.
---
*Some of them* is the key I think. I'm convinced that if you look at retail streamers who are actually good players (on retail) they will not be terrible on classic. Obviously if you watch Asmongold it's going to be frustrating because he's just not a good player, it's not about classic, he's just not a skilled gamer in general. 
---
If you have never watched streams before, you have to realise that there is a huge difference between different streamers in how they do things. If you're annoyed by the top streamer (highly likely, least common denominator and stuff), then look at some of the other ones, there's a pretty high likelihood that you will find someone who does things roughly the way you like them.
---

---
Me not the smart, classic health and mana regen good or bad?
---
thanks and can you tell me how is prot pala in pve and retri pala in pvp? at 60.
---
Yes, they have time to find and fix what's causing this, long as they make it a priority.  Really hope they do.  This stuff didn't happen with their original server architecture and it'd be a bad stain on launch, and reflect poorly on their commitment to recreate authentic Classic.
---
I think that the hype will go down in a few months and the game will perish inflames for long term.
---
4. It didn't trigger on-crit effects until BC patch.
---
Yea you too
---
I got in and so did 5 of my friends. None of us stream or make YouTube videos. Just because they sent content creators access to get more hype doesn‚Äôt mean those are the only people who got in.
---
I've heard of some BfA only accounts getting in, but it's all anecdotal
---
They are on 2005 now it seems, so guess I still wait for next week with 2006.
---
Hopefully they have a good understanding of just how accurate their own resources are and stick to their guns to filter out the nonsense.
---
Sometimes it's fun to one shot the level 19 cause you know his guild or who his main is and you want to stir some shit up. I love having that option.
---
Dual wielding, when you have 10% or more +hit gear and enough attack power, becomes better damage in raids than any other spec. The reason for this is because the main damage ability in the fury tree, Bloodthirst, is based on attack power and not weapon damage. A bloodthirst with a level 1 dagger at 1200 attack power will do the same damage as bloodthirst with might of menethil (highest top end 2 hander in the game) at 1200 attack power. One handers almost always have faster attack speed than 2 handers, and you'll typically want a slow speed high top-end main hand weapon and a fast (sub 2.0 speed) weapon in the offhand for rage generation. Your offhand is why you want as much +hit as you can get because even with the absolute best gear in the game, you will never hit the necessary hit% to never miss with the offhand. With dual wield you will be attacking more consistently and generating more rage, which = more instant attacks. If you have excess rage you can just dump into heroic strike for additional damage. However it is harder to gear up a warrior for dual wield than it is for 2H spec because a lot of the gear you will need for pre-raid BiS is leather. You'll have competition from rogues on it so be ready for salty interactions if you're Pugging and need on pieces that rogues want.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean.  Too many pushed for all the crap that‚Äôs on BFA and now it‚Äôs regret once vanilla classic is announced
---
Think about it.  People wanted:
---
Flying.  Yay.  Oh wait I have to do 2 part achievement and those that get it first are multi box gankers
---
Wanted assaults from legion.  Alright got my 370 geared alts within two days.  Damn nothing to do.
---
People want things and once it backfires it becomes the culprit and not those pushing for the item/events/abilities/etc
---
Classic wow will give us the 3 full trees again to tinker with
---
When honestly they could have just reworked the trees for all the classes and/or fixed the storyline
---
Who knows let‚Äôs see what happens
---
I‚Äôm just playing Magic Arena until Classic honestly
---
Make a dude named Ollivander on an RP realm, have a rad trade chat message, and profit.
---
&gt; So they can, but apparently I can't, now that's some next level hypocrisy you've got going on there.
---
No, you can too.  I never denied that and in fact wished you well.  You just can't deny you are an elitist gatekeeper, and that there is no mutuality between people like me and people like you.
---
&gt; Okay, here it is: Have fun and don't be a dick to others.
---
...but you defined "don't be a dick to others" as "doing anything I personally don't like."  Where in this handbook does it say you have the power to make that determination?
---
No, you did in fact say that.  Several times.  Here's one example:
---
&gt; You're mad that I don't want you in my group because the entire reason you want to play is to be a dick to others.
---
I always at least get herb so I can track the doom weed.
---
I'd say it'll be up on curse in less than a week.
---
Well, I meant because everyone who isn't a streamer that has gotten in, their account is from 2004-2005.  Just wondering if anyone later has gotten in too.
---
Layering is a great solution to a problem, if it's done well. Layering where anyone can at any time switch between whichever layer they want is not it done well.  
---
Having shared general chat would be only a very small step away from just having Right Click Your Portrait -&gt; Change to Layer#3
---
I‚Äôve got a great guild community going on, but we‚Äôre Horde.
---
I enjoy platinum wow‚Äôs videos
---
Lol, your name is Pelican backwards! I like it.
---
Yeah but this was announced back in 2017 man. It's been talked about in general games media for a while. Shit, the announcement trailer was the #1 post on /all that day.
---
Cope.
---
There were plenty of us who weren‚Äôt even aware that endgame existed when we started playing. I‚Äôm one of them. My high school buddy handed me install discs and an invite code one evening after classes telling me he thought I‚Äôd like it. I got hooked and didn‚Äôt even think about max level or what may lay there because I was too busy playing the game.
---
The percentage of players that made it into -any- kind of raid in Vanilla wasn‚Äôt huge. Lots of players just goofed around with their guild and ran dungeons and PvP‚Äôd and such. Raiding was a major point of attraction but it definitely wasn‚Äôt the only game in town, at least not to the extent that it is today.
---
A good meme while leveling is that when you're \~35 iirc you can spec prot and aoe grind to 60. On pservers it's pretty good but not sure about classic wow
---
Uh... experiences? Or experiments?
---
As a feral druid in vanilla wow, you are correct. They had to really put a lot of effort into being a good tank though. Be ready to roll enchanting specifically for the heart of the mountain (I think that's what it was called) BoP trinket they made that had armor on it! Had to be armor capped asap to make up for not being able to hit defense cap.
---
How do you kill he who has no life?

Not really, but kinda amusing. Esfand was cute afterwards as well:

One other thing I did was to look up the type of meat I had in the database, and see where the relevant recipe was.  A big one I got a ton of was mystery meat and I couldn't figure out where the recipe was, then finally tracked it down.  You can make a basic cooking food from Mystery meat (stam/spirit) but you can also make dragonbreath chili which is a great consumable to help tanks generate threat and thus sells very well.  I only learned all that cuz I had a few stacks of mystery meat and wanted to convert it to something useful
---
Wrong chubby. I've been here since 04
---
I'm probably just salty because I don't watch twitch, youtube, or give two damns about watching other people play. I played vanilla from beta through TBC 14 years ago and I just want to play again as soon as possible.
---
I think people are missing the point that if any game company could re release their original game and get the same if not more players than their current retal version....literally every single game company would do this lol
---
This is once and a lifetime thing we‚Äôre witnessing and cannot be compared to anything before it
---
Well, call me misinformed, I just read they're releasing it in August. Bout all I read lol
---
Yeah you and everyone else in the last two days lmao
---
no
---
thats nice hope it will work on classic too :D
---
upright orcs are a very new cosmetic addition considering the timeline of WoW. this feature will 100% not be available in classic.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm NA, only shows ‚Äúdigital WoW‚Äù or whatever added in 2010
---
It's irrelevant if /sit was 100% crit (which it was and no one is arguing that), it's that it didn't proc enrage/reckoning when it occurred prior to TBC. Nullifying the fucking point of the argument in the first place. Stop moving goalposts.
---
Savory Deviate Delights are a required raid item unless you have nogginfogger elixir.

Sad thing is he actually isnt being sarcastic, shoulda seen how he acted on the recent pvp server.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDXylJZuVLY&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDXylJZuVLY&amp;feature=youtu.be)  quality player.

this needs to be fixed before august. sharding/layering mid combat cant be happening
---
I‚Äôm NA too.
---
The fact that you made Joe Schmoe casual spend an extra hour to hit 60 when it's gonna take him 200-250 hours is completely insignificant. Whatever time penalties you impose on the people you gank they're gonna impose tenfolds more on themselves.
---
If you wanna talk about early early days ganking on power-gamers, sure there might be a small noticeable effect, but that's like a 0.001% use-case. I've played more than enough pre-shard WoW and I can assuredly say I have never ever ever heard anyone complain about how ganking is a problem in any way except people just being annoyed that it's inconveniencing them right now.
---
lmao his little tantrum reminded me so much of this [old LA television character's tantrum](https://youtu.be/1S2V77WCKuc?t=54)
---
They seriously dont say a word to you if you are selected. Check your launcher for classic beta where you normally select PTR. I did earlier and was able to install and play the beta.
---
I've released two addons that should work in Classic, I just can't test them.

I can wait, they have a lot of work to do as far as I can tell. Diablo 3 season 17 starts in a couple hours and ends when classic launches. I love Diablo, so I got the perfect distraction until release. \^\_\^
---
Arms works much better than a prot OT because you literally gain an entire extra dpser during single tank boss fights.
---
Arms is a superior spec for off tanks than fury, due to deflection and mortal strike causing more threat than bt.
---
There‚Äôs just one example of your ‚Äúmin max‚Äù mentality being flawed.  
---
you are literally just picking some arbitrary parameter as the thing that is beneficial to the raid and basing your entire understanding of the game on them.
---
Balanced raids are superior for the purposes of loot distribution as well. 
---
Many people overlook this but it takes longer to gear 10 warriors then it does 5 warriors and 5 hunters.
---
Furthermore, a geared competent hunter will out damage a fury warrior, so bringing 9 warriors and 2 hunters is only properly min maxing dps if we assume all 9 are geared enough to outperform the 2.
---
Min maxing is just the practice of making arbitrary assumptions and then saying they aren‚Äôt arbitrary.
---
It‚Äôs a shame how everyone just shuts down layering criticism. It‚Äôs a beta, we really should be talking about it especially if it‚Äôs not working as they said :/
---
Ok. This made me laugh.
---
It was patched in during TBC.
---
&gt; ...but you defined "don't be a dick to others" as "doing anything I personally don't like." Where in this handbook does it say you have the power to make that determination?
---
No I didn't, you made that definition up, here's a tip, don't make assumptions and maybe you'd find people more pleasant.
---
But I'm starting to see where you're coming from, you're seemingly have issues with being nice to people, so you can't find anyone to socialize with because people, rightfully so, find you obnoxious and now you got triggered because you came across yet another person who wouldn't stand for that kind of thing, and instead of trying to explain to them where you're coming from, you begin to attack them based on nothing but speculation on your part, maybe you should consider taking a few months off and work on yourself before classic launches, it will be much more pleasant for you and others if you do so.
---
&gt; No, you did in fact say that. Several times. Here's one example:
---
And how does that example tell anyone how to play the game?
---
This is correct - adjusted down to original rep values
---
I'm pretty sure insects and arachnids were in classic though?
---
Yep, thats not layering, thats straight up sharding.
---
That makes sense, thanks for the insight! I'm playing alliance with friends (Horde since Wrath), so I've decided to play a pally to buff them all. My gold making will be sub-par, so I'm putting a little bit of extra thought into being efficient with herb/alch cooking and fishing, as it seems to be a decent income for a spec that can't really farm efficiently, at least in reference to the farming classes.
---
Yup, thanks should go to all those emulator contributors instead of the tip of the iceberg.
---
&gt; The only reason I don‚Äôt want to play a warrior is because of how oversaturated it seems to be :(
---
Don't worry about that unless you wanna tank raids. Because for dungeons warrior tanks are worth their weight in gold. In raids they are the highest dps in the game. Very in demand as long as you are willing to work for the gear. Pop will not hurt you here.
---
In the case of feral. Firstly I will say feral dps is not a thing. That is not to say that theirs no spot to do some kitty work. That is to say feral is an off tank roll. You will be their to be an off tank and only be a cat when you are not needed as a bear. Normally this is one per raid but, that isn't a hard and fast rule some guilds may have two.
---
One thing you will need to know going into playing a druid. Is that you will constantly be asked to do 300% of the prep work of everyone else to achieve 90% of the result. You will be required to farm things like Manual Crowd Pummeler just to raid. Druids are a good class but, I gotta warn you. It takes a special kind of person to fall in love with them.
---
Druids are one of them classes that build a cult following to it's adherents. While to everyone else the idea of playing one sounds awful lol.
---
I was a noob mage who wasted Ice Block on falling rather than taking advantage of the blink mechanic
---
That was my thought. They don't have enough people to need to layer right now.
---
&gt; Reiterating for the nth time, YOU are the one who's trying to tell other other people get to play the game.
---
I'm not, I'm saying you are an elitist gatekeeper, which you are, and don't get to deny just because you claim that someone playing an off spec is a personal affront to you.
---
&gt; This doesn't make any sense, care to rephrase?
---
It makes perfect sense to me.  Point me to any official document you can find that officially states how your version of playing the game is the objectively correct one - including how playing an off spec is a "dick move" and mentions you, by name, as being the one personally insulted by this.  If you're going to make a determination on what "well" is in the context of the game, there has to be an official, objective, and canonical definition of "well."
---
Its like that on pservers too.
---
A fair amount of effort went into this. Take my upvote.
---
I mained a pally in vanilla, got to BWL before being sick of clensing and Low dps and rerolled Lock. Was a lock the rest of vanilla. Despite it all made a paladin yesterday when I got into beta. Not sure if I'm crazy or just a glutton for punishment
---
I know I have nostalgia for the launch of Wotlk paladins wrecking anything in sight. But doubt that'll happen again. Yet, seeing they have plans for the future, I'm not to worried now, was just uninformed
---
Code Red is pretty much a rebranding of the red Game Fuel.
---
Its cherry citrus flavor.
---
So you haven't played official vanilla in just as long as they have but obviously you are more deserving?
---
Jesus christ the entitlement you people have over the dumbest thing.
---
When people ask how others can be inhumane to other humans, how say slavery existed or why rich people are shitty to poor people, you can look no further than people like you.
---
Lording over the fact that you are some "true vanilla player" just because you played on a private server, and judging by how you are acting, most likely played Vanilla once when you were 5.
---
Get a life.
---
This was present, AND REPORTED as a bug last year at Blizzcon demo. 
---
They obviously don't care.
---
Not to mention feign death
---
Same here.  I have almost enough for a second token, so I considered playing a little.... but nah, not worth it .
---
Can someone explain why people are downvoting sharding proof?
---
Yeah, I've heard they are 1:1
---
They won't be dormant you have to willing opt in.
---
No one can answer because only content creators from EU got in it seems.
---
*Certain* items would drop for everyone in the party, this was mostly drops from named mobs, so you, probably, had it happen at some point.
---
The ress above the cave thing varies from cave to cave and where in the cave you died, there's a *line of sight*-ignoring max range on ress, so if you died near the top of a cave it's perfectly possible to ress above it.
---
Just outta curiosity, are you and all your friends actually subbed to retail atm? For some reason, I have a stupid inkling they might just be saying that, but will actually invite people regardless of whtether they're subbed or not, as usual
---
think it was linked somewhere in here, or at least a vod of it in, i cba to find it im lazy
---
Keeping fingers crossed for you, as you say - stay Frosty ;)
---
Once you are in we need to campaign for the addon devs to get their beta access so they can also start the dev work
---
Boost you shouts, do less keep agro on tabk
---
If you're a grown man stop using lol and lmao you sound like a little girl
---
It's beta. Report the issue. This flaming will get you nowhere.
---
In terms of health/mana regen people should have to be drinking more often after 2/3 mobs so i do believe it needs to be reduced abit more. For mob damage the devs would have to confirm that themselves as only they have the correct values for them but i think elite mobs damage in dungeons is abit low.
---
I guess I missed it.
---
how would u know that? in theory it should look exactly the same
---
Looks like the only way he would be able to kill that level 11 rogue.
---
It happens, You might have you make a new subreddit called something like r/realclassicwow like all the other subs have had to do.
---
The memes and streams get posted here with no real discussion becasue its been asorbed by the memers then you can have proper talks about classic over there.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer! If it's only mandatory for one boss, as a casual that will probably join a casual guild I think I'll be okay, but I understand how a dwarf would be really important thanks to you!
---
I mean as somebody who hung out in the private server Community for a while, I got very accustomed to the Natural progression of phases in the community. A bunch of classic service comes out, people go crazy over them, a few months later a bunch of burning Crusade servers come out, people turn their attention to that, then they do it with Wrath. And then repeat. While some people only replay classic servers or other people only replay burning Crusade servers, I try to tell people not to worry about how much of it is Nostalgia. If they feel like it is fun or it would be fun then they should play it.
---
Then you had the people who were super paranoid about rolling on a new server because they were scared it would not reach some arbitrary population number that makes them feel like it's worth it, that it would be a dead server. Luckily that is a silly stupid worry and we don't even have to consider it for blizzard classic.
---
I watch a few streamers because I like their personalities and playstyles. IDGAF if they never played vanilla. They didn't play Days Gone until it came out a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed watching that.
---
I'd watch you play Classic if you're not a cringey memelord and have a good community.
---
Is there a way to see when your account was made?
---
alexsensual made no such threats, or at least theres no evidence of him making any, he literally just laughed at a meme video and tips thought that means he can call the police on someone in real life. that combined with his entitled attitude we see on stream in beta, paints an ugly picture.
---
Yes all of us are currently subbed, personally my sub has never lapsed even when I wasn‚Äôt playing. Just never bother to deactivate.
---
Nope.  Then again, I don't watch any streamers play MMO's at all.
---
This comment clearly states everything wrong  with games today.
---
Fury becomes godlike later on.
---
Asmongold also said he fully intends to roll a PvP server, but understands that it will probably become unplayable. If that happens, he will go PvE.
---
Communities tend to get really blind to criticism near release. It makes it difficult to have actual conversations about the goods and the bads. I remember this issue during BFA Alpha. I didn‚Äôt like the global cooldown change but I was Hitler if I tried explain that. Hell, Anthem is a good example too. Not saying Classic won‚Äôt be amazing, but it‚Äôs never smart to block out critique during a Beta
---
Fucking ridiculous.
---
Oh shit, is there a frozen throne after that, somehow?
---
I feel like you have entirely too much time on your hands.
---
Seriously. Nostalrius and their devs/admins/gms don't get enough credit for what they did for classic WoW. They were the only private server that truly wanted to serve the community and make themselves obsolete more than anything. Thank you Nost.
---
This is not being contested, merely to give community a reference of what it could be based on 2.4.0 client data. In other words researching the older sources and comparing to this reference there is some difference in the values or tick rates, but they're close! It could mean that the values we're seeing in Classic 1.13 beta are correct and people claiming regeneration is too high are wrong.
---
They're not touching the 1.12 codebase. Respawn rates will be unchanged.
---
Of course. I had friends who spent months wiping to Hakkar. But at least you were raiding with guildies!
---
Every clone that came out in that 2007-2010 period failed because the end game was absolutely terrible. To this day. WoW has premiere endgame raiding.
---
thanks that explains it.
---
&gt;I know it might not seem like it, but not everyone follows this shit. I have to make this edit because trying to reply to people results in making drafts for some reason. I get it, I'm out of the loop.
---
The answer is a google search away, which is why people get annoyed by comments like yours.
---
Esfand just loaded recount or details damage meter (I cant tell) to his classic beta client and is using it in his stockades run right now. He showed it for a minute before he was bottom of the chart every pull, its still on its just hidden behind his cam I think
---
Diablo 3 season starts tonight.  Perhaps that could distract you for a weekend.
---
Please then, clarify what you mean "being a dick to others" really means to you.
---
Shouting? Lol no. People just dont seem to understand that not everyone follows WoW news like its gospel. Just trying to make what I'm saying more readable for people who dont seem to understand that.
---
I can't imagine getting this worked up over something like this. You're going to be fine, fucking breath you little freak
---
A lot of people here "distinctly" remember plenty of things. They're proven wrong and sometimes they accept that. Other times, they keep spreading misinformation like wildfire with absolutely no regard for the truth.
---
Vanilla Lakeshire on the left, Modern Lakeshire on the right: [https://i.imgur.com/gHLDUUK.png](https://i.imgur.com/gHLDUUK.png)
---
Find a streamer that has a VoD with Lakeshire at night and do a comparison and come back with your findings, please.
---
Counting the days myself as well
---
Layering shouldn‚Äôt be in Classic.
---
You can literally spin up 1.12 and know that's a lie
---
They'd probably take to it better than a retail WOW player
---
What if you enjoy being the first to do something?
---
Having an active subscription is the only clear way to be in the running. Having BFA isn‚Äôt a core requirement.
---
My first character was on Raveholdt. In fact, if Ravenholdt becomes a picked potential RPPvP server in EU then I am going to use my brother's old nick for his ancient night elf rogue. It's going to be the ultimate nostalgia trip.
---
Yes !! i wanna on 1000% leveling slowly and enjoy every dungeon and quest.. Ofc pvp in STV ! and always be dead :D
---
I would not watch anyone else play a video game under any circumstances ever
---
In vanilla, if played well? Yeah.  
---
Deadzone was a bitch with any melee class that could stun
---
I think if they do at content at 60 that would be a great cycle to follow
---
1.14 - Battle for kara - Patch adds kara raid with an attunement process based around get the key and using the CoT and progressively cleansing kara of a demonic corruption. Kinda like MC with the fire symbols but this can introduce a faction itself that is based around fighting demon corruption(Guardians of trisfal or a new faction). It would also introduce a new 5 man the kara crypt. 
---
1.15 - Take the fight to Outland - In kara you discover that the demonic corruption was coming from outland. This leads to us having to open the dark portal. This would be a server-wide event just like the AQ gates.  Once the gate is open it is just Hellfire to start. Hellfire citadel keeping it's 5 man and a raid. This raid would be smaller to keep Kara as current content and just supplement it
---
1.16 - Control of Outlands - With a foothold in Outlands we are ready to push deeper in. This could open up all the zones but netherstorm and shadowmoon. In these zones would be new questing content, factions and 5 mans. These 5 mans would probably have gear about MC/ZG level as it be a lot to ask people to keep raiding them with so many new raids (Before you kill me. Catch up gear was a thing  back in classic and it still has the legendary to keep people running it. In terms of raid content there isn't much but it is possible that maybe there is quest attunement for a new key into kara to either be a shortcut or open a new raid boss that was previously locked
---
1.17 - New Netherstorm raid that isn't based around demons and a new threat to keep the enemies fresh as classic was all other the place raid wise
---
1.18 - Battle for Shadowmoon - Server event to fight through shadowmoon and progress closer and closer to the temple by unlocking sections of the zone from enemy control.  Ends with a new Black temple raid that focuses on demons instead of Illidan(maybe Illidan shows up and helps us fight them this time)
---
This is just my thought of what I think would be awesome if they did TBC new but if they just relaunch a TBC server I am cool with that too. But it sounds like the opening of the dark portal would be a pretty sick server event.
---
P.S sorry for any spelling errors
---
I mean, yeah. That's going to happen when your healer is in their character sheet when the tank pulls.
---
I am not a streamer but got invited yesterday. Account since December 2004.
---
i'd much prefer to play there instead of with my fellow brazillians. problem is that i really want to pvp and im not sure how bad the lag would end up being.
---
See the same players within a play session
---
You can pretty much go non-stop since you have little to no downtime, depending on how you play. If you get a nice new slow 2h weapon you can pretty much one hit mobs with lucky crits for a while, though on the flip side you can get unlucky and have no seal procs so the mob takes forever to die. You have the heaviest armour, heals, loh and 2 bubbles so it's really hard to die as a paladin. You almost have to do it on purpose.
---
I usually unbind the s key but looks like I should keep it around in classic!
---
You can see when you applied game time here: https://blizzard.com/account/management/wow/subscription/payment-history.html
---
&gt; I'm not, I'm saying you are an elitist gatekeeper, which you are
---
Are you actually asserting you would never deny anyone from your groups?
---
&gt; how your version of playing the game is the objectively correct one
---
I never stated anything of sorts, again you're inventing stuff about what I said and thinking that, by some miracle that will convince me to think you're right, how do you even manage to wake up in the morning?
---
&gt;  including how playing an off spec is a "dick move" and mentions you, by name, as being the one personally insulted by this
---
If you can't see how intentionally making the game worse for others is a dick move, then I'm not sure what to tell you man.
---
Ye it's impossible to tell tbh, however "layering" should only happen upon logging in or by getting invited by a person from another layer than you. So either its layering not working correctly or it is in fact sharding. Again, we don't know.
---
You go ahead and believe that ;)
---
It's pretty obvious what Alex is.
---
Fury warriors were amazing fun to play in vanilla. I played a human warrior and it was tons of fun. Horde fury warriors are harder to play though because you do insane aggro and without Blessing of salvation it becomes very hard to do dps as warrior without pulling aggro.
---
I hate the QoL features in WoW that is why I quit in wotlk (but I did dabble in all the other exps though) and I just hate dungeon/raid finder and also hate cross realm stuff because it killed the community aspect of the game. I've been playing ffxiv since beta lately but I am gonna jump ship once classic comes out.
---
See I would love to play new WoW but I just wish they made a server that did not have finders and cross realm.
---
There will be sections where private servers are correct or incorrect, blizzard have the man power and the original reference client to deduce whether something is functioning correctly or not. Encouraging people to not make bug reports will lead to more issues in the long term not being fixed.
---
Personally, I love the "concept" of having a pet, but I hate the reality of it. 
---
Constantly having to control another character to play your class efficiently is just a level of thought process I don't want to have to apply to playing.
---
It can mean a lot of things, but in this case I'm thinking about people who only play the game to make it worse for others.
---
Thats okay, I know you did :)
---
Every time you're on. It's persistent throughout sessions. It's basically mini servers inside of servers.
---
This is obviously fake you dummies.
---
That's clearly an invalid battlenet ID.
---
Are you kidding? If he came from all then he would have obviously missed the post. If he doesnt get on reddit very often and browses all occasionally he wouldn't know what's going on. If he doesnt follow gaming news religiously he also wouldn't know that it's been announced. I love that we're getting classic as much as the next guy, but God damn this community can be toxic. Fuck him for not knowing about classic and asking about it, right? Damn it's like you already want to kill the game off before it gets here with your toxicity. Not everyone knows everything that's going on at all times. Idk why you have to be a prick to someone asking an honest question.
---
You can play off specs as much as you want, as long as it's not a bad off spec.
---
Same here. Grinded them for every bit of exp between 59-60.
---
im in the same situation...
---
Tailoring for me
---
My account was novemeber 2004 and no access yet. Subbed
---
did you have an active sub?
---
Yes I know. I am just pointing out that the first clip is Zone Boundaries.
---
No they haven't said yet. They are probably waiting for the stress test periods to get an idea of what the population is going to be like before they start putting out any concrete server info. More than likely oce has the population to support at least one server, but we'll just have to wait and see.
---
Sharding or layering. Either way it should fade out an NPC so I‚Äôm thinking this is maybe a bug rather than proof of anything.
---
Source? I'm open to being wrong.
---
You literally respond to your own post and make a bunch of other baseless assumptions, 
---
in the same manner you assume that min maxing is actually the most efficient way of playing and that somehow you are a superior player for supporting it.
---
I bet you tell yourself you are the most successful person alive because you live in your parents basement and people who live in their parents basement are the most successful ??
---
This is basically what your reasoning sounds like when you assume that something is superior because u say it is.
---
yes, only possible layering scenario i could come up right now is the server opening a 2nd layer and somehow porting half of layer1 into layer2 so one isnt nearly empty, but thats 100% guesswork
---
I was pretty on the fence about it. I played a ton in vanilla. Ive been there for years in the threads, liked the newer design ideals for years. Liked the quality of life upgrades.
---
Started to get more jaded over time, and recently started watching Asmongold clips here and there. He has a lot of points but I still thought it would be a flash in the pan.
---
Wednesday night after being out foubd out I got in first wave of invites and was like ehhh ill try it.
---
I hate that I am currently gainfully employed and have not stopped playing classic beyond biological necessity. It was a realization that running down a path for 5 minutes to reach Eastvale logging camp that THAT was more fun than ive had in a long time. When I learned to make rank 2 of water for my mage I was more excited than getting a titanforged item.
---
The game rewards you for your own small challenges and is so centered in the small time adventuring, it just feels like a different game entirely.
---
It will be more successful than people thought. 100%
---
He did not join or leave a group, or log out, or do anything at all that should allow him to be layered in this clip.
---
This is either straight up sharding, or some fuckery with a layer hitting its cap and forcing players that are already inside to switch layers - which shouldn't happen.
---
It's stupid considering most of them won't even actually test the beta.  But you also need to remember there are people who paid for the digital blizzcon ticket solely just to play a demo with 5 levels worth of content to do with dungeons unavailable.
---
And yes, I am aware most "influencers", streamers or whatever don't actually test the beta. They are essentially there for PR.
---
Was playing pserver last night and was just like "why am I even still here?"  
---
"Im just gonna play for a month or so to test classes"  
---
"ok just gonna level a few toons to 30"  
---
"Alright, lets twink this rogue"  
---
"Rerolling another mage to play as fire"  
---
"Never played gnome - lets do that"  
---
I realize I have a lot of free time that I'm not using responsibly to play more music lol
---
Cause I've personally experienced this shit, and that would make sense. You can't load the entire world onto your computer, short cuts have to be made.
---
Okay, I am going to start by saying I never once mentioned the number of fury warriors in a raid. Many guilds on private servers have 5 hunters and 5 warriors like you said. Yea its hard to gear up 9 furys and 5 rogues. the whole 10 warrior thing is optimal but not practical in most cases. There are ways to get 10 geared warriors (ony reset spamming and rank 14), but they are reserved for hardcore guilds.  I wouldnt want to be in a guild w 10 fury warriors either.
---
I never once talked about raid composition. I don't know why you are forcing that into this conversation. I never brought it up and I don't really disagree with you here.
---
As for Arms vs Fury vs Prot tanking, you are so, so wrong.
---
"Arms is a superior spec for off tanks than fury, due to deflection and mortal strike causing more threat than bt."
---
Flurry + Heroic Strike spam alone is way more threat than some small difference between mortal strike and BT. Never mind Death Wish. Never mind Enrage. If you need Deflection, you can always still get it. But, you don't. I doubt that MS on a one handed weapon actually does cause more threat than BT, but it doesn't matter. Flurry wins, I guarantee it. Playing arms tank w 1 hander feels terrible, your rage generation just feels so wonky.
---
Shield Slam got buffed near the end of Vanilla I believe, so I can understand why your memory of Prot would be tainted.  But prot specs are going to be quite fine for most guilds. However, yea having a fury off tank can be better since they will do more DPS. There is no reason to be arms over fury in a raid setting. Again, what did I say that was wrong? 
---
"There‚Äôs just one example of your ‚Äúmin max‚Äù mentality being flawed."
---
Sorry, but no. Arms is the worst spec for tanking hands down.
---
Okay so your not wrong. There are quest like the gems from all the people in WC where everyone on the quest can get the item. But generic boar ass quest if your in a group multiply the drop number bedded by number of people in your group. I do remember being able to Rez outside of caves but Obote my body but I think it was more limited in acutal retail vanilla.
---
It's actually really insulting that madseason didn't get in. He makes really quality content often and I think he would have happily made so much more content if he got it.
---
I am so hyped to have dungeons that are actually hard and not rushed down in minutes

it's called a "beta". that's wtf it is
---
Hes shouting because you people made it necessary for being fucking toxic af for just asking a simple, honest question. It's like you guys want to drive people away and kill the game before it comes out.
---
Didn't say they were, it was an example of how it came be used. There are probably other models that can be determined with this type of data.

So you can go over the player limit?
---
Is the Tauren hitbox bigger in Cat form?
---
That's not what they said man
---
These are game addons we're talking about, not integral pieces of the *nix ecosystem or any other kind of important/sensitive program. I very highly doubt any of the devs who wrote these umpteen years ago would care if you adapted their creations, whilst crediting them, to work on the classic client.
---
For me it‚Äôs actually really frustrating watching a streamer ask questions that I think are very obvious or make mistakes that I know I would never have made. So, no I wouldn‚Äôt watch someone with little to no wow experience.
---
Yep, me not being able to provide a clip proves Im wrong. "Clip culture", jesus xD
---
Not a fanboy of tips, I just hate saltiness and toxicity. And there is plenty to go around here.
---
How dare you find a bug in a Beta? Surely it's purely for fucking around and speedleveling to 30?
---
Reckoning was good in vanilla bro.  I‚Äôm sure you have seen the Kazzak video.
---
The problem is time and money. It‚Äôs a waste of resources to have someone sit there and have to determine if the Classic path matches the Vanilla path, even if it‚Äôs a single dB query to compare coordinate values.
---
yes, 100% agree, i wrote very similiar things in the other reply :)
---
when did you authorize the beta participation in your profile?
---
You literally have no idea what you're talking about... you're contradicting yourself in every comment you throw at me. Ganking is that exactly... a fucking inconvenience. It simply slows down the opposites faction at progressing. And if you can't agree with that, you 1. have no experience as you state in preshard wow. or 2. you're just being an ignorant stupid fuck. And the fact you're asking for proof on the situation shows you didn't play alot of preshard wow because you should already know how much it can slow someone down. You can gank someone a few times and make them log of rage or make them run to another zone more than likely on foot... if several 100 people do that to the opposite faction it slows down the whole faction. I don't get how you can't grasp that concept.
---
LMAO that was actually entertaining

Yes, another ‚ÄúThey're testing things in a Beta therefore the game is ruined‚Äù post.

You report the issue and you move on

Yeah, frig off mr. lahey!

Ive played on some private servers, shits weird I mostly did jumping puzzles for rewards, other than that it was pay me money for you to win

Couldn't that easily be a respawn/despawn glitch? All the other mobs are patroling just fine in the area. If it was phasing, wouldn't the surrounding mobs be in different locations? What a cry baby, lol.

No you can't, but that's hardly the same thing.

I think there's gonna be a lot of mages and rogues. I was going back and forth between mage and lock, as I played a lock in Vanilla and a mage in bfa. Sounds like every person Who isn't a tank main is going mage  or rogue so warlock it is!
---
well just going to stick to my shaman then &gt;:)
---
thanks again for the help! 
---
Know where i could find bis enh shaman gear? I haven't seen much content on enhancement shamans and i guess i know why now lol
---
This is the correct link. Thank you. I was also having a hard time finding my first month.... Ive spent over $3000 on wow over 12 years.
---
All of these "proof of sharding" posts happened after a server restart.  Most likely, blizz flipped the "layering" switch to test some things, and now wonky stuff is happening to everyone in the beta.  LAyering is new tech for them, so of course there will be early issues.  But that's the point of a beta: to identify those issues and correct them before launch.
---
Screaming about them obviously testing things in their testing environment before the game is even out does nothing but make you look stupid.
---
&gt; Are you actually asserting you would never deny anyone from your groups?
---
If the only difference between them and another member is their spec not being the same (meaning they had all the necessary gear, consumables, and so on), I absolutely would never deny anyone joining my group, and never have.  Especially if they're my friends in real life, or a nice person (note: my definition of "nice" is the commonly held human definition, and not "not playing the spec I want you to play"), or otherwise a pleasant person I'd want to spend the next several hours with.
---
&gt; I never stated anything of sorts, again you're inventing stuff about what I said and thinking that, by some miracle that will convince me to think you're right, how do you even manage to wake up in the morning?
---
You claimed an objective standard, players playing the game "well."  I'm asking for the official position on what "well" is in WoW.  (Hint: I'm being sarcastic, there isn't one.)
---
&gt; If you can't see how intentionally making the game worse for others is a dick move, then I'm not sure what to tell you man.
---
So we're back to you defining "being a dick to others" as "being an off spec."
---
Layering only exists to offer a smooth launch, without needing to create many servers that will end up dead in a few months, with only a few ending up being populated. This is what happened in Vanilla wow.
---
Sounds like maximum fun
---
‚ÄúI CAN EAT AND DRINK AT THE SAME TIME!‚Äù
---
My account was created November 2004 and I still dont have an invite
---
Tips did play in classic, you can see his achievements In armory, also just because titles didn't come out till tbc doesn't mean your not a scarab Lord if you ring the gong in time...
---
They added it in? Swear I first found it in classic, was searching the word crap on thottbot.
---
Trying to guilt people into playing the way YOU think they should play based on your flawed assumption that some specs are somehow intrinsically better sounds like the opposite of teamwork there kiddo.
---
&gt; **Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?**
---
&gt; Charges generated by the forced crit when you sit do not activate reckoning.
---
The thing you posted was a bug, the rapid spam gives it away.
---
I played a rogue in vanilla.  It fucking sucked trying to find a group as a dps.  I was in a guild with a few good friends, but we were not usually on at the same time, and when we were, rarely wanted to do the same dungeons.  God for bid two or three of us were dps and wanted to run something.
---
I'd go hours spamming trade for a group.  Most nights, I wouldn't run a single dungeon.
---
When I came back to the game to play WoTLK, at first, I thought dungeon finder was FUCKING AMAZING.  I could queue up, do whatever I wanted in game, then get that sweet popup when a group was ready.  Eventually, I decided to roll a tank, for instant queue.
---
I ran EVERY 5 man, many many many times in heroic.  So did all the random groupies I'd end up with.  Most dungeons, no one would type a single word.  Everyone knew their exact role.  If the group mates ever got replaced with bots, I would not have even known.
---
This got really stale, really fast.  It actually made me hate the game.  I'd log in, do my dailies, do the required dungeon, then log out.  It was like a second job.  A chore.  I never felt that way in vanilla, even when raiding.
---
I'm now willing to admit that I was absolutely wrong about the awesomeness of group finder.  The only positive thing it accomplished for me was proving that it was a feature that made the game worse.
---
You really want to level up with someone as a Paladin, they are one of the slowest classes to level up.
---
Preach! I'm looking forward to both of those most  of all! I also agree that this is a great post with a lot of good tips for new players.
---
Jesus dude. With streaming being an incredibly overwhelming and difficult job, you expect these guys to report bugs too?!
---
&gt; BuT tHeY cOuLd JuSt MeRgE tHe ReAlmS
---
whats wrong about that? make it so that you cant switch layers but having then on one server so no duplicate names happen and then merge then. would be a much better solution because of the lack of immersion breaking.
---
No I would but, all of the private server ones I have seen. All turn out to be lies lol. I also don't know what patch adds which weapons. So even of the BiS lists I do have. Much of it won't be available for phase one. Legit guides for that are still being made.
---
&gt; I very highly doubt any of the devs who wrote these umpteen years ago cared to include a license, 
---
That's kinda the point, without a licence giving us rights, they're by definition *NOT* open source as the original creator still holds all the copyright.
---
&gt;  I also doubt they would care if you adapted their creations [...]
---
I absolutely agree, but this doesn't change what I said above.
---
He did this 100 times already to asmon so funny haha
---
Why would you make this thread when you have know idea how it works?
---
As a blizz dev in a community event, this guy probably had a long day of answering the same questions to hundreds of people; I'd look the same, tbh.
---
"I didn't get in so obviously no one worthy got in"
---
I dont understand why people would be mad about not having a sub to be able to play beta.  
---
Fucking babies!
---
Legit impressed
---
If someone's never played the game before they're not gonna be rushing shit. Stop with these daily begging posts, no one cares how you think how other players should play the game. Just play the way you want and shut up about it already.
---
Haha I should probably rebind it to something. It's honestly not bad for tiny hops like that
---
The person he replied to there was not being toxic. Maybe other people were but that's no reason to be hostile to someone that wasn't.
---
Oh, well then how does it work on blizzard servers then?
---
For real, I'm so tired of leveling through 1-60 and having the same villain in all the zones half the time.
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
---
Didn't Atlas Loot even have a warning that it could disconnect you?
---
I did the same, I was really surprised it worked!
---
I compiled information from old Vanilla guides and tested a ton of *general* stuff in p-servers while comparing them to the guides.
---
[Here's a link to a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpgknr/leveling_guides_that_consider_gearing_and_class/enszjxq/) where I write a guide for someone who is interested in leveling as a Paladin while doing some healing in dungeons along the way.
---
nothing really looks wrong here tbh, he walked by and aggro'd the mobs at the front of the room, and then decided to pull the ones at the back as well. if youre referring to the aggro range of the mobs in the back it doesnt really seem that off, the mobs are reasonably far away. theyre probably right on the edge of their aggro range and hes only one level lower so its not like they would aggro from a mile away to begin with.
---
Yes, been active for a few months. Not subbed for all of wow, had some huge breaks.
---
Im still not convinced zone boundary phasing was in OG vanilla, how were world bosses kited to capitals back then? Ppl are claiming this was also on pservers so the consistency means its right, but pservers developed a zone sharding system themselves to handle their populations which is partly why nost was so successful.
---
omfg read chat guys, its priceless ... im fucken crying
---
I think Vanilla had better immersion. If something is big it hits like a truck. Same thing with the Diremaul King for example.
---
Ya I really enjoy the PvP but I feel sad thinking about raising on one.
---
Lol now you went full child. You just confirmed what I already knew by your original comment. Have fun!
---
Unless I'm mistaken, it gave you like a -10 nature resist debuff.
---
Ok mr blizz dev. Now give me an invite.
---
Thanks for testing. I appreciate knowing for sure but expected it would be as it's always been fairly good on linux.
---
Considering it's using the new engine there *might* be some gains from DXVK too, although with vanilla graphics the difference might be a drop in a bucket.
---
Wasn't the original wow reveal at Gamescon?  Good possibility that it was not even being recorded, as at the time this was a very exclusive event for publishers, devs, and press.
---
Blizzard have said before (after the blog post going on about demo bugs) that they will prioritize them and minor things will not be fixed, people shouldn't have to factor in when making a bug report whether blizzard has the time and money to investigate and fix it, if you think something is a bug you should always make a report for it as they're the only one confirm it because they're the only ones with the accurate data.
---
I GOT IN!
---
Go watch Tipsout.
---
Would I watch it for hours? no but I dont watch any stream that long. I would prefer it over all the other streamers I found though
---
Wait until you install 20 addons. It'll be triple of the load time.
---
it doesn't matter if you haven't played classic or not. what matters is if the stream is entertaining.
---
Like just now? Or yesterday? I'm curious how often people will be selected
---
In 1.12 SL locks are probably the strongest pvp class, definitely the strongest 1v1er. Rogues are still good but nothing crazy.
---
May the Dragon ride again on the winds of time
---
and it was reported in the demo as well, feels odd they still haven't got to this.
---
If I can‚Äôt infinitely kite elite dragons across 6 zones into a level 10 town I‚Äôm going to be pretty disappointed.
---
So you're admitting to declining people. Why is it okay for you to decline people based on whatever arbitrary factors you choose, but it's not okay for me? Are you also a "gatekeeping elistist" or just a hypocrite?
---
&gt; So we're back to you defining "being a dick to others" as "being an off spec."
---
Well, you couldn't give me another reason to play it, soooo.
---
Human and undead.
---
Our hero.
---
&gt; Charges generated by the forced crit when you sit do not activate reckoning. 
---
The thing you posted was a bug, the rapid spam gives it away. So being that it was a bug, means that it was fixed, which also means that it won't be in Classic.
---
I would think area matters. If you imagine a bunch of enemies scattered around two hunters, one of the tauren. The tauren would have more enemies within melee attack range and less in range attack range. 
---
The tauren would actually have less enemies in attack range of one or the other. A larger portion of their max range area is covered by a dead zone. 
---
I wonder how this functions with warrior charge.
---
I am not here to attack you as a person. I presented facts and arguments and you just went on this huge tirade about your hate of private servers, going on and on about random things your guild did in Vanilla. 
---
"in the same manner you assume that min maxing is actually the most efficient way of playing" 
---
What does this even mean? Min/maxing is all about playing efficiently. You are the one assuming that some random arms build you did in Vanilla was the best and trying to justify it.
---
Around 100-110 from the UK
---
You heard wrong.
---
Yikes.     
---
1: You're not allowed to stream private servers so you can't stream it otherwise anyway.    
---
2: Soda has played pservs off stream and done so many vanilla experience raid runs etc way before classic was even announced, also played in vanilla back in the day.    
---
3: Esfand is a vanilla streamer and pserv streamer on youtube and got banned for it    
---
4: Asmongold has been playing since vanilla and has always advocated for classic well before it was announced as well.    
---
Imagine thinking "We all know why they're streaming it" and talking out of your ass.
---
One might be able to find a PFD of them somewhere.
---
It was announced at ECTS in 2001.
---
True but almost every time a non streamer or ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù has gotten a beta invite they‚Äôve reported to have a 2004 or 2005 account
---
Yea Im sure you will be fine man!
---
Streamers pushed really hard. I logged in to northshire abbey last night and could hardly find living kobolds there was so many people.
---
I watched Joana stream last night, and he knows a fucking lot about Vanilla, and a good 40 minutes of the stream was him being utterly unable to figure out how to fucking work the chat panel to create another one for Guild Chat separate from general stuff.
---
Would never happen. The most I could see happening is an NPC with a similar name in a future update.
---
So how did all the streamers get in?
---
It wasn't patched out, it was patched in, in TBC. It never existed in Vanilla outside if a /sit spam bug that was fixed prior to 1.12.
---
Seen a few people say it on this thread and the subreddit.
---
It's just weird, some people on retail want classic to fail so they can be proven correct about their opinions. Some people on here want classic to kill retail so that their opinions can be considered superior instead.
---
The angst and anger is real tbh. I'm hyped for classic, but it's an older system that isn't everyone's cup of tea these days tbh. Both will succeed as usual.
---
I have no idea. I was just hoping that there was a 40min panel or so as they have today.
---
I played in vanilla and for periods with expansions. I'm not an influencer/streamer but I have beta at the moment. I really think it's random but they are issuing waves very frequently. You can tell with all the new players hitting goldshire. Hopefully this gives you hope. It doesn't seem to be a popularity contest.
---
what day did you sign up for beta participation?
---
Leveling in the name of!
---
Ah thankyou
---
Sure, this can happen. But if you're doing content that is harder, you will have to communicate. 
---
At a certain range in m+, you have to do interrupt rotations, and other call outs that will go a lot smoother if youre on voice. 
---
I never ever felt the need to add people during vanilla TBC or wotlk. Most content was doable. It just took time. 
---
Other then raids, which i got a guild for. Nothing else required me having to reach out, or use voice. (outside of arena) 
---
This is not a statement about which game is better or which community is better. Vanilla obviously had the more active community. I'm just stating that your experience with retails players is waaay off from mine, and finding people to add/people who use chat is live as all hell in the m+ community.
---
Ah, I knew it was one of those.  Even still, my point stands.
---
$15 is only one lunch but you'd get hours of enjoyment out of that. People, let people use their money like they want to.
---
I've been feeling like that for years dude hahah. I was going to upgrade my PC a few years ago and then realized all I was playing was 10+ year old games and just didn't bother.
---
It's probably important to note for anyone that doesn't play it, in classic mobility is a big deal.  It takes a long time to get from point A to point B.  Aside from a hearthstone once per hour, you generally don't have a way to get around other than walking.  The character that falls off the boat has a loooooooong swim ahead of him, and more walking/boat riding to get where he wanted to go.
---
Because fast lane is the best lane!
---
Specially that time of the month
---
What a disgusting guy. He looks like a combination of a pig and a moose lol
---
TiPsOuT ClAiMiNg #1 WaRrIoR LOL!!... seriously, if you even watch him for an hour you'll notice that the question, "do you think you rank in the top warriors in WoW" he's always been humble and says he wouldn't consider himself even in the top 100. Clearly he's sick of the question being asked and gave the trolls what they wanted so hopefully the question would stop being asked.
---
Oooo, this just reminded me why I dont watch these guys. I HATE shouting.
---
Man, I miss that page on ytmnd.
---
Micheal Scott? SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP
---
I was just trying to clarify that software (or code, or anything copyrighted really) being abandoned does not mean copyright law stops applying to it.
---
I enjoy Asmons streams now and then, I know a lot of his antics are fake and put on to entertain his channel.
---
But by God he's a terrible warrior. For a guy who keeps harping on about the good days of classic, he really struggles with the basics of the class when tanking.
---
But I'm super pumped to see classic reach new heights so I'm glad he's streaming.
---
Nobody cares that you aren't interested in some clips dude, go elsewhere then, stop looking at reddit.     
---
We clearly like watching the game and want to watch it, why are you here if you don't want to see it?
---
I was trying to avoid namedropping people, but Soda had (still has?) a pretty bad run in with gambling. Gambling and/or scamming viewers was pretty big with Counterstrike as well.
---
Nginx + Lua for web microservices. Bloody small footprint for high load.
---
This was one of my favorite things to do when I first started playing since I ended up in barrens forever.
---
it‚Äôs not in for good. they literally said that. calm down.
---
Pot calling the kettle black.  This is just a goof, chill.
---
&gt; So you're admitting to declining people. Why is it okay for you to decline people based on whatever arbitrary factors you choose, but it's not okay for me? Are you also a "gatekeeping elistist" or just a hypocrite?
---
These's a big difference between taking a level 1 character into a raid, and a 60 off spec with all resistance gear and consumables.  This is in no way unreasonable and if you legitimately can't see a difference here, you're just digging the hole deeper for yourself.
---
&gt; Well, you couldn't give me another reason to play it, soooo.
---
No one needs to give you a reason why they do anything.  You are not the boss of the game, do you understand this?  I am not asking rhetorically.
---
I like how you defend them and somehow see what I said as streaming should be gone completely :)
---
Pretty good time, did you go to EK at all or just stay in Kalimdor?
---
Then how the fuck did Tips get in
---
FWIW I'm basically in the same boat as you as far as what I'd like to do.  I'm good with healing in either pve or pvp, but would like an alternative to go to when I want a change of pace.  That's basically why I've been flip flopping between rolling shaman or druid on launch
---
Are you getting critted 100% if you sit? In PvP? In PvE?
---
Does it proc reckoning? Does it proc enrage?
---
I remember reading the thread about it but forgot the answers that were there. If anyone could dig the answers to all the questions, I'll try to remember this time :D And OP should then report whatever is wrong.
---
Youre actually retarded.
---
Uh, you don't "grow out of" autism.
---
Nah man, still gonna sink another solid 100 hours into Pillars of Eternity 2 before classic comes out. Gonna finish my Marathon speed game of Civ6 too. I got a lot to play still.
---
If the clip is good and meaningful and isn‚Äôt a complete waste of time and 4GLTE data then sure post it. I don‚Äôt have time to watch asmongold get killed after a duel....
---
Maybe he is confused with blood pike.
---
Similar experience here. Quit near the end of TBC to focus on RL and didn‚Äôt regret a thing. Then started working with a guy who played and it got me excited about the game all over again. Picked it up for about 3 months during Wrath and quit again for the final time.
---
Then I heard about Classic by complete chance (like, a meeting ran late and as I was walking out to the bathroom I pulled up Facebook which had the live stream of blizconn on where they announced it as I was watching), 2 new computers later (one for me and my SO) and I‚Äôm so pumped for classic it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
YOU CAN ONLY CHANGE LAYER BY JOINING A GROUP TOPKEK
---
He's like a horse in a hospital.
---
To be fair, the whole warcraft series has suffered a whole lot of retcons over all the years it has existed. WC2 retcons some events from WC1 in order to fit the new narrative, WC3 retcons some events from WC2 and it goes on. That's part of the reason why the lore in WoW is a mess, since it was all built on retcons and badly thought out story lines, save for Arthars'.
---
\+ 500 cool points for the Pellucidar reference
---
You can also stand still and jump and while in the air press W.
---
I am playing on a pserver right now, and all of the crocolisks are phased on the border between durotar and barrens.
---
Those are typically done on Wednesdays.  I'm not sure if anyone will respond to the one from a couple days ago, but you could look through them and see if there was a similar question asked by someone else and see the responses.  Otherwise you can try and post in general, or wait till next weeks thread.
---
And now all the new elitists are here too
---
i got 3 invited today with my 3 accounts created yesterday
---
A lot of people from 2004 and early 2005 haven't received keys.
---
Just the one snip.
---
niceeeeeeeeee
---
Yeah, don't rush to 60.  Ignore me skinning all of these Devilsaurs.
---
God, I fucking miss Classic play. I really hope they do justice to the Classic servers.
---
It's just there for world first don't ya know? An example of how layering works to inform the community in case it's something we don't want? Naw that doesn't sound right.
---
Sounds like you wanna roll a Troll though. Based on the temperament of this sub, most people are all about min/maxing it like there's no tomorrow, but I prefer doing what sounds fun! If you like the vibe and the idea of shadowguard, I say go for it!
---
Side note, I'm also rolling Troll Priest because fuck yeah.
---
Did you get an invite today? Been constantly refreshing :(
---
Ahhh okay. I did not know that.
---
I opted in for beta 30 min after it went up, and my acc is old and has been subbed constantly for multiple xpacs, still didnt get an invite
---
Nope, sorry you got downvoted and got your post deleted for nothing. You seem triggered tho.
---
I was kind of feeling this as well, I'm just on the MTG Grind train for now, Maybe some LH here and there to practice 1-30
---
I really think the use of layering needs to be rediscussed https://clips.twitch.tv/InventiveSlipperyBaguetteKAPOW in this situation particularly, as it just resulted in a death which could mean alot if you're progressing through an elite zone to get to a quest mob etc.
---
The amount of severe delusion in this subreddit is truly impressive. This is so sad that combat sharding is happening in combat, ya I'm just not calling it layering anymore.
---
This is a normal respawn, this has nothing to do with layering, wtf?
---
I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean.  It's a guy leveling up his unarmed skill?
---
Also this pic isn't even from the beta.
---
Where is this stated? Because to my knowledge this isn't how it works with sharding.
---
What‚Äôs it to you what I look like on my char?
---
I also remember this happening in vanilla. My (reliably uninformed) best guess would be some sort of ram clear whenever you change zones. 
---
Happening within zones, like some of the other clips show, is harder to guess for, but it might be the same tech as zone transitions working a bit wonky, or even some zones being split into sub-zones.
---
Vanilla wow had some weird stuff happening occasionally. If the same stuff happens now, I guess the go-to rage will be about sharding/layering instead of straight up just calling it a bug.
---
Does the mob not have get twice as many chances to dodge tho?
---
It is THE game for lots of us
---
So basically you are agreeing with me on the first 2 points,  except for the ‚Äúspreading out the gear‚Äù comment.
---
I think what you are alluding to is that concentrating loot to the raid group is better then distributing it to the guild as a whole (regardless of raid group or not).
---
#1 this was not quite my argument.  Basically, if your raid is getting a lot of hunter loot, let‚Äôs say, it might be beneficial to the raid to bring an extra GEARED hunter then an undergeared fury.
---
#2 even focusing on loot efficiency is not a perfect methodology for raid composition. For instance, it might not be beneficial to the guild if you concentrate loot to a select few of ‚Äúcore raiders‚Äù if your guild has an inconsistent raid roster. In this situation it might actually be better to distribute loot such that your guild is progressing in loot as a whole as opposed to a concentrated few.
---
This counter example illustrates the flaws in trying to come up with any sort of categorical all encompassing strategy for raid composition.
---
Implying that valuing ‚Äúraw dps and hps and tps‚Äù is somehow a superior strategy to any other perspective is not only arbitrary it is incorrect (in at least a few situations discussed)
---
In my defense: I wasn‚Äôt aware this had hit r/All.
---
Nothing better than a 4 day AV. Felt like you were entering an actual **battle**. You'd spawn back into the game after a night's rest and inquire about the current situation. The fatigue-ridden neckbeard would anwser that your faction has been fighting up the snowfall graveyard for the past 10 hours, both ivus and gnar have been summoned and obliterated, and the neckbeard isn't sure what day it is. 
---
*mwah* that's quality game design. Unfortunately, to spoof advancement and profession the game picked up "pace" over the years and things became faster and faster losing the elegance and subtlety of things such as long AV skirmishes.
---
They will invite masses for the stress test
---
LOL youre right its from a private server
---
I see 2 realistic options. 
---
Either they create BC servers and allow people to transfer/create new characters while merging the remaining vanilla players.
---
OR, they look into creating some sort of horizontal content which is what Im in favor of.
---
Yeah, I'm super confused as well lmao
---
Data center jobs tend to be lonely. So yea. No windows either :(
---
Did you check them last night at all? Because they did send out invites yesterday
---
Yeah this is one of my favorite specs to play, I farmed a shitload and got Naxx gear on one of the instant 60 pservers.. It is a crazy strong spec mostly for PVP with a 2h, but you can easily just swap gear and be a very competent healer. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/A3r0MQQ_UzhwAA
---
You can switch points between divine strength and improved SoR in the holy tree, but this is pretty much a cookie-cutter holy/prot build that can do it all.  If you want to be more PVP focused I would ignore shield spec in the prot tree and instead go toughness with those points, and with PVE focus you can probably take points out of improved Hammer of Justice and go into either toughness or improved righteous fury.  Plenty of 'wiggle room' but the basis of the build is 21/25/0 with 5 leftover points as you want to get divine favor and 5/5 reckoning. 
---
You could PVP with a shield and a slow 1h for reck bombs, but I think you generate a lot more potential threat by having reck bombs with a 2h.  if you switch weapons you lose Reck stacks, so you can't just have a shield for extra protection and then bring out the 2h.  Plus, caster 1h often have bad damage so if you're using a shield I would say you're kind of ignoring your Reck potential. 
---
As a paladin healer you will mostly be spamming FoL but holy shock is a great "oh crap!" button.  Consider that the global cooldown is the same though- so if you cast holy shock you still have to wait 1.5 sec to cast a new flash of light, so you could have just cast a Flash in the same time but ofc holy shock throws that heal out Juuuust a bit quicker and can also be used on the move. 
---
I think if you're going to PVP heal with this build you want to use a regular weapon (not a heal weapon) to benefit from the much higher DPS.  If you're in a raid guild and you plan to PVP as a paladin, you want to just get your hands on as much t2 or t2.5 as possible it is perfect PVP gear.  It doesn't have the pure healing power since it is mostly +spell damage instead of just +heal, but of course it buffs your offensive spells as well.  
---
You can easily 1 shot people with holy/reck using an "entry level" 2h weap like the level 60 AV mace, the 55 AV polearm, arcanite reaper, or any of the MC 2-handers.  
---
Many go prot/ret 0/25/26 as well for seal of command, pursuit of justice, and sanc aura but personally I think having the points in holy instead greatly increases survivability and focuses on being a true supportive class which is where the paladin shines.
---
how would you know if you are layer 1 or 2 to begin with? people are just searching for holes that arent there...
---
The delusion is real in this statement. Not working as intended? When did they ever say it was a perfect system that just fixes everything? This is sharding, with a new name that clearly doesn't function any better than retail. Welcome to a destroyed phase 1.
---
Yes, they are not exclusive. It was just an example of how reliant I have become on WAs to guide me through playing the game.
---
I was considering trying one of those realms, but now it just seem strange to, since we are only a few months away
---
Doubt it, they already have a bunch of brain dead customers loving what they are currently doing.
---
&gt; This is in no way unreasonable and if you legitimately can't see a difference here, you're just digging the hole deeper for yourself.
---
You're right, it's not, but I don't think it's unreasonable to not invite a person when inviting them would make it harder for the rest of the group.
---
&gt; No one needs to give you a reason why they do anything.
---
You're right, they
---
&gt; No one needs to give you a reason why they do anything. 
---
They don't, but if they refuse, I can only speculate on their motivations.
---
&gt; You are not the boss of the game, do you understand this? I am not asking rhetorically.
---
This is so ironic coming from someone who's trying to tell others how they should play the game.
---
It's not clickbait, it's literally world first on Classic servers :)  
---
Also, nobody is falling for it like "clickbait" people click it and know what they are getting.  
---
 They're not that dumb.
---
Imagine thinking this was from the classic beta

I've just been mindlessly playing Fortnite with friends while keeping this subreddit up on my second screen, refreshing it every 5 minutes &amp; sorting by 'new'. 
---
I put in a week of vacation time, starting the day before the release day. I'm so, so ready. I'm currently recruiting as many friends/coworkers as I can to play. Many of which have never played WoW before.
---
I‚Äôve mained a paladin my whole WoW carrier. Love the class. 
---
Prot will be really hard to do outside of 5 mans and even then most people would rather have a Warrior or even Druid. Imo you are a jerk if you try and raid as prot as you will be a burden on your whole raid team. Not saying it‚Äôs impossible just saying you are filling an important roll in the raid with a sub optimal Class/Spec. I have raided as a Prot paladin since BC but you just don‚Äôt have to tool kit when compared to a Warrior in Classic. Which is why I am rolling Warrior for Classic. Because I want to tank and pretty much only tank.  Now if we get Classic BC Prot it up. I tanked OT and/or MT on every boss except parts of Sunwell (our guild like many others never full cleared Sunwell) with no problems.
---
Ret in PVP is great as long as you play all of your class. By which I mean Buff/CC/Cleans/Spot Heal when needed. If you have the mentality of a support role you will be very effective in both world PVP and BGs. Kill folks for sure but remember all your tool kit. You are way less of a burden in PVE than prot is. 
---
Keep in mind you are a MONSTER as a healer. So expect guildies to try and get you to go Holy.

Interesting. Your winterspring comparison ([vanilla](https://i.imgur.com/sDbE9jh.jpg), [retail](https://i.imgur.com/agZ1f54.png)) does seem to show more stars night on vanilla, at least to my eyes.
---
Do I check my email for invites or where would I see it?
---
Sweet, thanks! 14 day trial used in 2006 :)
---
I'd argue that paladins are better at healing. Both PvP and PvE. BoL was just too good. Priests are definitely better than druids tho
---
You would still be fury but just 2h

.. The last time you played wow was 10 years ago?
---
Nope from my classic wow screen shots my dude, found a bugged bear back in hillsbrad
---
Dude the WoD prepatch at the very end of mop introduced "the great prune" what are you talking about?
---
I hope no one plays my class. It's nice to be needed.
---
No I'm not telling you what it is, it's a secret.
---
thats exactly how it works with sharding....
---
Hi, /u/Kelo_malo
---
Ok, Blizzlike was probably a poor choice of words, fair enough, but that's besides the point. The point was LH also has zone sharding because Nost developed it to save on server performance. It isn't an accurate representation of what it was like in Vanilla.
---
Fair enough. Rank 10 + hand of sulfuras is what I'm looking to do :)
---
did you get into beta?
---
Because you're telling people how to live their life, lol.
---
Launcher account selection.
---
Classic wow is being officially launched by Blizzard-Activision and the launch date is August 27th (26th for North America). It only takes a subscription and not having to rebuy the game. Definitely worth a look if you were ever into WoW in the early expacs.
---
I was planning on doing Skinning &amp; Herbalism &amp; your reply made me feel stupid. :D
---
Mage tank ragnaroz you heard it here first folks imaUPSdriver ended that misconception in a hurry. I'm going resto hunter personally.
---
Cheetah form on warriors. No cooldown. Root/slows/poly? Np
---
Sorry making it green don't make it a druid. 0/10 rating...
---
Obviously this is a bug. Hope that streamer reported it instead of just complaining about it.
---
Mine only goes back to 2017 even though I started playing in 07
---
Except anyone with 2 brain cells would drown themselves if they didn't die of fatigue and just spirit healer rez to save time.
---
Ion specifically mentioned seeing the same people when you log throughout the world with the only ways to move layers is through partying with friends on different layers.
---
Otherwise it would be no better than sharding. They created layering specifically for creating as static of a world as possible until the collapse of all layers to a single server comes.
---
Mages could tank at one point after spellstealing a buff in one of the dungeons in cataclysm I think. So Ha!
---
Kinda neat actually that you can find every class in the comments here. Different strokes for different folks I suppose.
---
Yeah I thought Druid as well. However elemental dps atleast works in PvP. Druids seem to only be useful for tanking and healing. Their dps specs seem lame. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty set on shaman. PvE healing is just as fun as dps. Still gotta know the fights and spamming chain heal is no different than spamming frostbilt or something. I like the hybrid  abilities for pvp. Can‚Äôt imagine playing a character that can‚Äôt heal themselves. However I played ret pally all through WOTLK. Guess it‚Äôs time to switch sides haha
---
What.. :D I think you're forgetting how broken Ice Lance was early TBC.

What's the difference when people will be looking quests up on WoWhead?

I had like 120 days plays on an orc hunter in retail vanilla and the stun resist was disgustingly high. Like j would get mad if a stun actually went off on me
---
Orc is #1 for PVP.
---
I've never understood this sentiment, why should you need to grind on every character to use the same mount? It's not like your warrior can ride your warlock/paladin mounts, or the new class ones. Some people get bored of playing one character. Hell the only mount I really use on any of my characters was the resurrection gryphon because it's a cool ghost mount. This was introduced after the mount change to be a tab if i remember correctly but it was better than never being able to use that mount again because the person I used a ressurection scroll (recruit a friend who used to play) no longer plays and I no longer play that character (Might have even deleted it, after WotLK I deleted every single character that wasn't 60+ or had a special memory attached).
---
Tauren don't have a longer maximum range as well?
---
I leveled both a paladin and warrior during vanilla.  Leveling a paladin was definitely easier.  Warrior is unforgiving if you pull too many mobs.  With a paladin, pulling an extra mob means you just need to heal a time or two.
---
Well, there was at the very least a portion of players who legitemately wanted them.
---
I wonder if people would react differently to pandaren if their origin wasn't an april fool's joke and Kung-Fu Panda didn't exist, considering the game has bipedal cows that aren't minotaurs and bipedal dogs. I mean, even as far back as 2010, when I started with WoW, there were people who wanted to play furbolgs.
---
I believe in the terms of service it reads that a guardian or a parent is allowed to share account with a minor. Try to search for it.

He played during vanilla plenty, and a ton more during TBC. Stop talking out of your ass for things you have no idea about please. Making me roll my eyes into oblivion here.

where's the bug reporter? how'd you get 4k health?
---
It really seems like a lottery of people with 04/05 accounts, I haven‚Äôt seen anybody say they‚Äôve been invited with a more recent one.
---
so youve got multiple addons that dont work for anyone currently in the beta, a tabard, plate armor which you cant wear until level 40, and over 4k health, a mount, and youre trying to pass it off as the beta? lol gtfo dude
---
I know the spot no problems.
---
I have a 41 or 42 pally that is 21/21 holy prot and you still feel like you can barely handle over 3 mobs effectively, thats with a fresh epic shield, shield spike, more than half plate gear with int stam. I've seen some paladins at higher levels tank more, but it can require your bubble and bandage at times.
---
BG's are cross realm guy
---
I have, but isn't that the reason it was nerfed to 5 stacks?
---
Blizzard takes half a year to fix some bugs so... Better start reporting ASAP.
---
&gt; Nope from my classic wow screen shots my dude, found a bugged bear back in hillsbrad
---
Incorrect.
---
- That bear is 21
---
- At level 30 (Beta cap) the highest level gray mob would be level 19
---
- Unarmed is leveled to 219, assuming 220 is cap, you're level 44, 14 levels above Beta cap.
---
bundl'a'sticks right here.
---
Well I hope mine comes soon. I'm getting anxious lol
---
Can you track mining and herb simultaneously in the beta?
---
It's from my vanilla wow collection of screenshots guys, jeez
---
I'm rolling a hunter and I'm gonna wear 6/8 tier 0 to start with.  More hp, MUCH more mana and a bit more regen
---
I'm gonna be sacrificing a couple of % crit but i should have more AP and be able to fight a lot longer
---
Crit has diminishing effect above 21~% apparently so it all works out perfectly
---
It‚Äôs suspiciously similar to the Eastern Plaguelands, just saying.
---
Because if you still trust Blizzard for this kind of thing you are retarded. Layering destroy the economy and the community aspect during the levelling. Nobody know when they will remove it.
---
\&gt;.&gt;
---
There was literally another pruning in the Legion prepatch. And then another one in the BFA prepatch lmao.
---
So they run on linux?
---
Your name is quite fitting..
---
It's easy but slow. You will pretty much never die as long as you don't pull more than you can chew and you have very little downtime. Ret is the fastest way to LvL but you can level as any spec with prot being the slowest.(can't sit to proc reckoning from what I hear) your leveling experience will be auto attacking a mob and then healing yourself after you kill it. In terms of pve content you're most likely going to be healing unless you can find a guild that will allow you to raid as ret, though to raid as ret you will be very busy farming because the amount of consumes you will need to do decent in dps will get expensive. Ret takes a lot of dedication and I don't recommend it if you're planning on being more casual. Prot and holy are both good for tanking 5 man's though holy  might be better for newer players cuz holy shock makes pulling a lot easier and is good instant single Target threat. I would say you are the worst healer in pvp due to lack of instant cast heals and that makes you susceptible to counterspells though you are very tanky and bring a lot to the table with your blessings. You can pvp as ret as well though people will hate you for not healing instead, but that's not your problem so have fun. Overall very versatile class  and I find it fun to play.
---
It's a bit janky at the moment but all the elements are there.
---
Somebody had said it isn't increased. I'd imagine we would hear about how tauren hunters are the best class/race to pull in instances if it was. I've never heard that tho. 
---
If I was on the beta I'd test it but oh well.
---
&gt; This is so ironic coming from someone who's trying to tell others how they should play the game.
---
Okay, let's sum up our positions and compare which one of us is telling people how to play the game.  I'll go first:
---
If you're nice, friendly, have a good attitude, and so on, I will play WoW with you, regardless of your spec.  This is a game.

---
&gt; SM ruin you get killed in a global and do shit dmg 
---
That's some solid fake news there, SM/Ruin does ***more*** damage than conflag in both PvE and PvP, at most you could say it has less burst in PvP, but even then ... The 10 points from Ruin to Conflag are not really worth it, there's way better in the Affli tree, simply put.
---
SL/Nightfall is a 1v1 spec, nothing more, and even though it's OP in PvP because of its survivability, it's trash for PvE and group PvP.
---
&gt; literally everyone  
---
Not at all. You'll see more SM/Ruin locks than SL/NF ***and*** Conflag locks ***combined***.
---
People saying Classic sucked, you never played it. World PVP &amp; moments like this were plentiful.
---
I personally think the beta looks easier than private servers. There‚Äôs a video of joanas leveling guide when he‚Äôs in durotar and the regen of health and mana is WAY slower in the video than the beta.
---
I always thought it was a lance in front of a bird's head O.o
---
There's actually consumables you can use to force purge and then NS while the shaman is on global. I use to do it on a private server all the time and I don't see why it would work differently.
---
There will be a huge drop.  Tons of regular retail users who never played Vanilla will try it.  Some will stick around but many will not like the slower play style, difficulty, lack of "options" (most only have one or two viable specs) etc. will likely lead them to quit.
---
I really dont want to play a warrior.
---
Part of it is that I just really dont like their class fantasy. Every spec revolves around the fantasy of being a berserker or a barbarian, even though it **only** makes sense for orcs, tauren, trolls, and maybe dwarves. All the other races who would fall more under a knight or some other type of fighter just make no sense.
---
Part of it is stance dancing. It just seems like such a pain to try to figure it all out and play with.
---
And part of it is that I just fear that warriors, with them being the very best in not one, but two roles (tanking and melee dps), that so many of them will simply act like elitists toward everyone else. And that's the last thing I want to be labelled as.
---
What you're seeing are snowflakes sir.
---
Uhh how is what you are saying relevant? Players are never forced into other layers. When they start their login sessions, they are forced into a layer until they log out or join a party thats on another layer. It doesn't happen randomly like sharding.
---
ITS NOT THE BETA
---
cool. and?
---
Are you advocating that the new classic should have a bugged bear in hillsbrad so people can level unarmed skills, otherwise it'd be a change?
---
I completely misunderstood you point #1, I thought what you meant was, it's better to bring 3 hunters so you have more people to distribute on should you get more hunter loot.
---
Regarding point no 2 I completely agree, which is why I would want to distribute the loot a lot more than what would be 100% optimal for the raid assuming the same comp every raid, which is why I declined last time I was offered a spot on loot council :P It would be an eternal struggle inside me every time :p
---
In general I think we agree and any disagreement you might've perceived comes from misunderstandings from either me or you ;)
---
On a teacher's salary?
---
No he could clip into the floor and become invulnerable.  It was a guaranteed raid wipe if it happened.
---
I once saw a feral druid get dft because of dkp.  Never again
---
It took me 12 hours /played for 110-120. 12. I don't raid, mythic+ is ok once per dungeon maybe, but the whole "it's the same thing just with higher hitpoints and a timer" is just not fun. Now I'm unsubbed after a week.
---
Holy shit you're right.
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH my plan, don't tell anyone.
---
Yea but the Rez buff was pretty rough in Classic. He‚Äôd lose gear quality. It‚Äôs not like wow now where it costs nothing to repair. I remember people not having enough money to repair. There‚Äôs also a negative effect your character gets for a while. 
---
Either way, there are pretty big consequences for him falling off like that.
---
Laughs in m.2 sata drive.
---
It's fast as hell. Just boring.
---
boring =/= slow
---
I hit 60 in Silithus during vanilla at like 3am.  I was HYPED. Even kept typing in guild chat even though no one else had been on for over an hour ;)
---
I posted it for laugh as I remember finding it back in the day that is all.
---
ah if its actually a picture from old vanilla then my bad, just shoulda mentioned that in the post or title somewhere considering people are posting all sorts of dumb shit about the beta and it wouldnt shock me at all if people are posting fake screenshots trying to troll or something
---
Ya that was nachoing.
---
Back in my day we had to walk for 30 minutes to get to the quest objective, uphill on both sides with mobs that phased into existance right in front of you and gangbanged you to death! And we liked it that way!
---
lol :p
---
So we just gonna ignore the ‚ÄúPornhub 4 life‚Äù...
---
Ok then...
---
Hi, /u/iletyoulive
---
Do mages have slow fall in classic? I remember it costing a reagent but I dont remember when it was added
---
Also does blink work to avoid fall dmg?
---
They very clearly stated not only would original registration date count, but total amount of time subbed.  Idk why people thought just jumping back to a sub would get them in the first few waves
---
Not sure if that's supposed to be some emoticon I don't get... or just two arrows poiting east :p
---
Druids is just good in open world PvP. Stealth + Tracking is an undervalued, or even overlooked, combo. I use to carry different sets of gear around for different classes.
---
I'd imagine there will be some sort of armory, unofficial or official. If you could somehow pair that with tracking you could even show icons of what class you're stalking.
---
The best loot council I've seen is to have one officer and one random raider be on loot council. The officer and raider change every week. Loot council also gives the ability to distribute loot to push progression but hey different strokes for different folks
---
Interesting, not one post ago you said something that doesn't add up with your position presented here.
---
On top of that, you've also told me, several times I'm not allowed to choose who I want to group with.
---
But my position is exactly what you just wrote.
---
This is why Classic is 100x better than the garbage that they‚Äôre putting out today.
---
Right on. Have a good one man.
---
same, told myself im not gonna roll DH or monk to start like I do every season, plan right now is WD start then do the other int classes. Gotta stretch this out for as long as i can!
---
If you combine paladin and shaman to account for the faction split they are actually the most popular according to this poll.
---
What does it matter though? You need to report everything you think is a bug. Blizzard has 1.12.1 client, they will just check if its right or wrong. It's better to report it and be wrong, then not report it and it might wrong.
---
Do you need to have an active sub to receive it?
---
Even in retail most pvp instances are in US East, i pvp with usually 120ms in Sao Paulo. So its not that different.
---
If sharding/layering/whatever is THIS fucked on launch, then I guess I won't play until they remove it. I can't wait to play classic, but there's absolutely no point in putting upwards of a 100 hours into a version of classic that has the same issues I'm trying to get away from in retail.
---
All these mages thinking they're gonna all aoe farm for ez 60 has me laughing
---
Think I'll stick to reading posts, like a witch hunt in this sub right now...
---
This thing is pretty cool.
---
Oh very true. I just realized I haven't played WoW on an SSD.
---
The seamless zoning seems to be the least cloned part of WoW and it was the most impressive
---
I believe in you, just follow your knife for those sweet pelts and furs.
---
It's also literally the top post in the subreddit. Kinda annoying that people just click on the comments section of a post from the front page and pretend like the entire subreddit behind that post doesn't exist.
---
Given the first 2 days, they seem to be later in the day. Maybe early to mid evening times PST.
---
Let me explain paladins sub lvl 20 they are a great leveling class feel decent with kill speeds. Every level after 20 I felt weaker and weaker in 1v1 situations as far as damage output the trade off is you also rarely die. About lvl 55 I remember fighting monsters and my dps being complete garbage because I had specced holy in the 45-50 range. Thank god for my consistent leveling partner he helped my paladins grind more bearable.
---
NA?
---
Does anyone feel like the weather effects occur very rarely, obviously have no memory of the timer on how often it should occur but the only time I've seen it happen was on staysafe's stream yesterday in wetlands. I know weather effects are rare in retail today but were they that rare back in vanilla?
---
They can't be camped if you are there first camping them.. I'm curious why you chose fire, but to each their own. Did you craft any wands or just use the Bashalaran wand until you finished up loch?
---
Be prepared to be a Clothadin at 60 is all i'll say.
---
I'm pretty sure that's a bug, as they said once you logged in you remain on the same layer for that entire play session
---
I guess that's the break even point.  But you would need more for it to actually be worth it over another dps.
---
all those guys gamble with sponsored money lol
---
Killing time at ikea and apparently twitch won‚Äôt load on ikea wifi. You‚Äôre a hero.
---
You know all these youtube videos and streamers pushing for ‚Äúhow to make gold‚Äù are just manipulating people into stupid choices.

Skinning is good if you just vendor the skins though.
---
So basically you are challenging 
---
%1 flurry causes significant threat
---
This is not true because in tank gear your Croat rate is very low so flurry uptime is likewise low.  
---
#2 ms causes less threat then bt.
---
Maybe on the pservers this is true, but the threat caused by MS was superior in vanilla and will be superior in classic assuming they use the same databases
---
You are simply factually wrong about this.
---
#3 you seem to undervalue the flat avoidance increase of deflection.
---
2-3% parry is literally 2-3% avoidance and avaloidance is pretty important to a fucking tank.
---
#4 Since neither of us have access to the vanilla databases (which will be used in classic), the only evidence either of us have about the actual vanilla viability is anecdotal from our time playing vanilla.  
---
if u played vanilla you would have realized most tanks (even mts) were ms (arms) spec for most of vanilla.
---
Because you are disagreeing with this, it leads me to believe your anecdotal data is based on something beyond vanilla (I‚Äôm assuming you are using your pserver experience for your shitty opinion).
---
Pservers use different databases then classic will and therefore your observations about fury generating more threat are intrinsically unreliable because they use different databases to function then classic will use.
---
At best you are misremembering the trends in vanilla, at worst u are using an intrinsically inaccurate observation from a pserver as justification for the accuracy of your claim.
---
Hey you got mail!
---
This guy should be removed from classic beta.
---
He stunned him mid fall ..?
---
I have a feeling this might be Photoshop.
---
I can tell by the pixels
---
"Just unbind the backpedal key and it will be fine, you'll never use it."
---
Well its not being better in a 1v1 situation then is it?
---
Dude just because you played vanilla doesn't mean you get into the beta automatically.  Ion said the beta was going to be small so there's no reason to get your hopes up
---
Esfand is actually affected by the res sickness debuff in this clip. It's why he was dieing from a character multiple levels lower than him. It lasts 10 minutes and you basically cant mi anything while you have it so the other guy would definitely be better off swimming back or hearthing
---
I haven't used the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client in years. Vastly improved art to what I remember.

Yea i also have a family bnet account and multiple wow accounts under it that i pay for...would like to do the same with classic but cant seem to find a clear answer anywhere. Just guessing and moronic responses.
---
If it‚Äôs red; it‚Äôs dead.
---
psst, hes making fun of you
---
it was an honest mistake thinking that was a screenshot from a private server, people just dont want fake stuff getting spread around and causing confusion. this sub is already confused enough as it is with things like layering and whatnot lol. genuinely feel bad for ragging on you for a legit post you thought was funny. next time just make sure to say its from your collection of old screenshots or something like that so theres no confusion
---
Alk clip doesnt seem right. That croc is phasing hard.
---
Honestly you shouldn't care so much about which race/class is the best in classic. I get it that people want the best in bfa because end game raiding is 90% of bfa while end game raiding is about 30% of classic. Play what you want and what you enjoy mate
---
Been on Nostalrius when it released back 2010 ( as a french server way before it was released worldwide ) and Daemon ( the founder ) was already doing an amazing job.

Sir, can you please step aside? I need to ask you some questions....
---
porting for what? they are using the same addon engine
---
Thanks to the first popular vanilla server, VanillaGaming, which inspired many other Pservers and was responsible for  [https://classicdb.ch/](https://classicdb.ch/) . Thanks Nostalrius too I guess.
---
I got beta but Im not installing it lol
---
The only reason I am not on an RPPvP server is because it took them too fucking long to release one.
---
Ooh nice!
---
Just go to bed early and wake up in the morning?
---
Thanks for letting us know...?
---
Load times are dramatically improved. I was beating my cousin into dungeons on retail and just waiting on him to show up. But my rig is completely overkill for wow. Currently have a i7 6700k(a little dated but still kicking along) 16gb ram, and a gtx1080 to power my 4K monitor. Needless to say it‚Äôs kinda fun knowing my machine is stupid overkill for a 15 year old game but I‚Äôm still excited to see what my frames are compared to my laptop I played with in 2005.
---
People rly do go way out their way to stack 50 buffs and then pretend the game is so easy. And that part about fishing lmaoo.
---
We were all noobs once.  None of us were immediately good at the game.  But too many forget that and view classic wow with the "GIT GUD RAIDER IO GEARSCORE" mentality that has permeated modern wow.  Just gotta take a step back and remember where we all came from, and realize that for some people, this will be their first time experiencing this just we all did 14 years ago.
---
You can‚Äôt level as a healer in any reliably speedy way. You‚Äôll want to level as a dps/tank spec.

Imagine thinking weather occurs too frequently.

Lmao to be fair you don't have a clue

Sounds like a PvP server isn‚Äôt for you.

Unless they are pieces of shit who don't want to group up because they get less experience per mob if they are in a party.
---
They just said that lol.
---
Updating graphics is cool, but changing models entirely? Nah chief.
---
Yes :(
---
You're trying to theorycraft 2v2s in Vanilla but you're using things like FAPs and the SoID?
---
That's just dumb. You have too many variables to effectively determine who would win - does the Warrior have a Goblin Rocket Helm? Is it a Dwarf Priest? What races are the Mage/Rogue? Is the Warrior Human and used Perception to pull the Rogue out of stealth first? Did the Warrior pre-pot with Fire and Frost protection potions? Do both teams have grenades? Is the Mage being Dispel spammed by the Priest so he doesn't have Ice Armor or Ice Barrier up for more than a second, assuming the Mage is 17/0/34? Is the Mage 21/0/30 (no Ice Barrier but has PoM)? What level of gear do all of these people have? Are there pillars or objects to Line of Sight each other?
---
Etc.
---
I actually have the exact same PC except I have TI version of the GPU :D
---
Pretty sure that's supposed to be Barrens?
---

Yes if you don't mind killing things very slowly.
---
Im beginning to be torn away from undead rogue to orc rogue.  
---
But then again i said a year ago i would main a warlock..  
---
Ill prolly end up on a shaman.
---
I very well can believe that! Armor, hp, damage and resistances were released in form of beastiary book which is an amazing reference for those things!
---
Node respawns, mob quantities were always a guesswork at wowemu scene and they were never correct, so anyone saying its wrong on classic I don't know.
---
Another huge misconception that people will be disappointed of is the dynamics respawning. It didn't exist in vanilla, Ion had confirmed it in one of the interviews.
---
That isn‚Äôt a player....
---
If they want a 1:1 creation then they should be bitching about the graphic qualities.
---
&gt;	anyone else
---
No you‚Äôre LITERALLY the only one
---
&gt;enemies or players
---
I wonder if it has different rates because you're using 2.4 data... ü§îü§î
---
I‚Äôm really jealous :(
---
Hey, look at you ground!
---
&gt; at least a 4 year degree in STEM (Preferably Conputer science or Mathematics for min/maxing) with copies of transcripts
---
Can I sub a 2 year diploma + 9 years real world software development experience?
---
The croc is disappearing, but AK is not switching world's or layers or anything.
---
It's an unrelated glitch.
---
Oh that is a really cool idea. I like that. I played a hunter, so appreciate the value of tracking in Vanilla.
---
ive been watching StaySafe, hes pretty cool, seems to know what hes doing
---
I played some private server and was like "Holy crap this is wrong" when starting a warlock. I was surprised they gave out such an op pet
---
They will be keys at some point I am sure, they said the same about MoP, warlords, legion and BFA all got keys at some point IE wowhead giveaways etc
---
Paladins spend most of thier time in a raid rebuffing people.. with buffs that last 5 minutes. Not all that fun compared to actually healing.
---
I have no interest in the beta. So I didn't even try. losing my progress would be soul crushing. 
---
Just so you know Hand of Rag costs a metric shit ton of money. So make sure you have that money farmed before pvp drops because you won't have time to farm it then.
---
Triggered.
---
Shoulda mentioned PvP high ranking! Can't be going around being in a tryhard guild without that rank 14 gear.
---
Was kind of hoping someone had made a parody video. Like really mediocre pvp with average crits and a lame alt rock soundtrack. Had a good 15 min off and on laugh about the thought of it.
---
You can play as druid and its not that bad then
---
All these clips started popping up right after a beta server restart.  So it's a good chance that blizzard turned something on to test, which lead to these weird clips.  If anything, it's a GOOD thing that this is happening.  The more feedback blizz can get during their testing about how things work, or don't work, will go a long way.
---
This happens in pservers and there isnt any sharding, its common in that specific point in the map that mobs zone in/out. Maybe its the border barrens/durotar that does this.
---
All right, seems just like phasing in retail.
---
That sounds miserable.
---
it‚Äôs a trap
---
More than a third of the APIs and BlizzardFrame objects are gone now. If you have any references to BFA only APIs, the addon will throw.
---
You can level as a healer just not quickly. Or you can do a hybrid spec so you have a bit of heals and a bit of dps. Problem is you have to have two gear sets (depending on class) and you wont be the best healer or best dps but while leveling that dosnt really matter.
---
...and this isn't an apple. Point is "not" working as intended.
---
The usefulness of this poll is gauging how many players of a given class will be available for groups. Since we don't know the faction split, we can't easily extrapolate. Assuming a 50/50 faction split across the rest of the poll, these numbers for Shaman / Pally will be roughly doubled when it comes to how many players are around to group, pvp, raid, etc. If this group has a 60/40 Alliance / Horde split, then about 20% of Horde players would be Shaman.
---
Why rush when theres a dead end?
---
I'm more worried about making friends and enjoying the social aspect. I really wanna go for a nelf priest right now, but I never played alliance and have horde bias, always felt like home, liked the people there. There's time to decide, I guess. Don't really have any friends that are gonna play sadly.
---
Stealth is a novelty at first, but since Vanilla I've never been able to get one past 30.
---
Nope. The mob disappears before it‚Äôs killed, and two mobs are instantly ported in. Also, if it was respawns, they wouldn have 5 seconds of inactivity before they aggroed. They were pre existing mobs from another instance of the area.
---
&gt; Interesting, not one post ago you said something that doesn't add up with your position presented here.
---
I thought we clarified that reductio ad absurdum, but I guess not.  
---
I never said you couldn't choose who you group with.  I said the exact opposite in fact.  You can't, however, behave in an elitist manner and then claim you're not an elitist.
---
&gt; But my position is exactly what you just wrote and claim to have as your position, despite this whole thread pretty much being proof otherwise.
---
You have consistently and repeatedly said that you consider people who play an off spec to be committing a personal affront to you.  Even when asked to clarify your position.  I repeat, you consider people playing the game in a manner you personally do not approve of to be an insult to you and an anti-social act.  You further claimed there is an objective, correct, official standard on how to play the game, and when I mockingly pressed you onto providing proof of this, you could not.  
---
Your position is that you intentionally discriminate against anyone not playing the game to your exact specifications, and choose to associate only with other people who share this view.  Furthermore, you consider this behavior to not be elitist, and your behavior to in fact be pro-social, while deriding those who choose to play an off spec as intentionally being a dick to you and you personally as their sole motivation for doing so.
---
You are a prime example of someone who puts "higher numbers" over everything else.
---
Any idea why they don‚Äôt just make like a 6 hour cooldown for hopping layers? Seems like a simple fix
---
Couldn‚Äôt justify the splurge I got mine when they finally came back down to 500$. But it‚Äôs a good card.
---
Are you blind?  Watch the video, he didn't even finish killing that mob.  This is classic sharding/phasing.
---
You can't get karma with the ingame
---
This same spot is bugged on private servers, I remember trying to do these quests and the crocs would just disappear. Also the lake between duskwood/elwynn. I feel like water has some weird shit on this game.
---
It's definatly Durotar, though I agree it does look quite like the Barrens :)
---
Streamer: bug reported
---
I have no opinion on the streaming.
---
I'd say though that I think Classic is not that hard. Or at all. It was developed as a "casual" MMO. I think people here oversell how "hard" it is. It just takes time. A lot of time.
---
Of course I have no idea how "unforgiving" those survival games you play so I cannot really say how hard it would be for you. In any case, it's a very fun game if you have the time for it.
---
Durotar tigers and lasher eggs took a long time.
---
Zalazane was on his 15min timer.
---
There's not enough in the beta to layer lmao.
---
That makes an assumption about the faction balance among the other respondents.
---
Tagged NPCs shouldn‚Äôt disappear whether it was layering, sharding, or whatever. This is likely just a bug and may have absolutely nothing to do with that system. 
---
Plus I doubt there are enough players in the beta to require layering or sharding to begin with. That will happen in the stress tests.
---
I think there‚Äôs a paladin class hall under it
---
deleted? lol its -1 downvote, oh my heart D: how will I ever go on lol?
---
It depends on the raid. But just generally? 8-10 warriors (3 prot) 1 feral druid 1 restored druid 6 rogues 5-6 mages 4 warlocks 2-3 hunters 6-8 shamans 4-5 priests. Once you get to aq, you stack mages more. If you want to speed run mc/bwl bring like 25 warrior. No joke.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DifficultProtectivePlumPhilosoraptor another clip
---
If they can update the graphics why not the modes? They go hand in hand.
---
More likely you just die of fatigue.
---
I know this is petty... but I dont actually like the anniversary logo bit. The actual picture is awesome though!
---
You‚Äôre a pretty toxic person mate.
---
I highly doubt it
---
Unless you are leveling in a group of 2-3 dedicated dps, you really don't level as a "healer."  You are just a character that has healing spells.  You can spec into dps trees and still heal fairly decently.  Specs really don't matter until 60, as you have all the tools needed to do your job while leveling anyways.
---
There are no BoA items in Classic.
---
God damn this is just awful.
---
"flurry causes significant threat
---
This is not true because in tank gear your Croat rate is very low so flurry uptime is likewise low."
---
Unbuffed I have over 20% crit right now in pretty average BWL level gear. 5% crit from being in Fury XD. Flurry uptime is very high. Fury tanking is indeed dependent on having decent AP for BT and crit from gear for flurry.  "Your crit rate will be low" is a pretty crap argument. Again, I guarantee that it is more threat than Arms. 
---
"2 Ms Causes Less Threat Then Bt.
---
Maybe on the pservers this is true, but the threat caused by MS was superior in vanilla and will be superior in classic assuming they use the same databases"
---
Again, you could be remembering something from previous patches. But yea, I imagine early on you will get more dmg/threat from a MS than a BT. At some point, you will have enough AP that BT overtakes MS I think, but I will have to check. Regardless, flurry is huge. Enrage is massive. Death wish. 
---
I don't undervalue that avoidance and I would go an impale spec that takes full Deflection for Naxx where that avoidance really shines. In all the other raids, that avoidance is unnecessary. I would just wear less TPS gear and more avoidance gear if it was needed. But it really isn't useful other than Chromag enrage (just shield wall), Cthun Tentacles, and helpful on Brood but not needed with good healers.
---
"Pservers use different databases then classic will and therefore your observations about fury generating more threat are intrinsically unreliable because they use different databases to function then classic will use."
---
Wow Classic uses a different patch than what you played on for the majority of Vanilla so your MEMORIES of a game you played 15 years ago are intrinsically unreliable and inaccurate observations as well. But its very easy to keep flurry up and I guarantee that fury out threats arms.
---
Prob not, unless OG collectors edition
---
I can supply you with the background image if you wish, just give me a resolution and I will give you what you want! :)
---
Not sure drowning yourself as an undead (a lot longer breath time) and taking res sickness would be better tbh.
---
Shield had to be equipped to use I assume? Cos then shaman could have used it and this comic would be wrong
---
Which isn't an excuse. It's bad there and it's even worse here considering blizzard has the resources of a multibillion dollar company to fix it. It's completely different than how the "layering" system was sold.

I think they said no email because those are easy to fake.

Very much in the same boat. Cant load up a game without feeling like i dont want to play it. Just sat here watching classic streams.

All I need is my fulbolg suit and my deviate delights.
---
I was watching Asmongold's stream and got a really peaceful hit of nostalgia when I saw that he was in a group that wasn't automatically teleported to the dungeon. I'm so excited to actually go places and meet people again.
---
Did you find the video? I couldn‚Äôt find it.
---
I want a battlestation! All I have is this lousy 30/40 inch dual monitor setup. :(
---
I‚Äôm excited to tank 5 mans mostly. I plan on leveling a Druid and I‚Äôm interested in trying to off tank on him eventually. 
---
My main goal is to try something different and see how it goes. If it isn‚Äôt as fun I‚Äôll be ready to swap specs and pick up a more conventional build.
---
ROFL.
---
no :\^) It wont even have 10% of retail players 3 months in
---
Good thing you're here to do it for me.
---
**I identify as a rush.**
---
As the games become more mainstream it becomes less infested with bowing weebs, not that surprising.
---
Maga spinoff hats? Agree on the rp part. Gosh i hope my chosen realm dont get diluted by some obnoxious streamer in classic. Madseason is solid, i also enjoy frostradamus. Hoping Jesse cox will do more content on classic as well.
---
BETA
---
My friend did and just got in, he has had the same account since 2004 though, just didn't sub since before BFA (and doesn't have BFA).
---
Also good to point out that with a quest Horde can port to Gnomeregan in booty bay (at least I think this was around in vanilla).
---
man retail click and s shaming is so bad that you literally unbind the key? all that does is limit your options rofl
---
Ur from 04 and you want upright orcs in classic? Excuse me? 
---
Must be trolling.
---
That's such a minuscule unimportant part of their experience that only someone who never played a hunter would point out lol. 
---
Did you hate Pala because of mark of kings?  Never made mage portals because of runes? You could buy ammo, had to manually farm soul shards.
---
I am interested in trying the holy shock tanking build. It just feels like a lot of points that won‚Äôt go towards mitigation.
---
Let's just ignore the fact that sodapoppin only got popular because he was a rank 1 feral on multiple occasions while streaming on xfire. Or that Asmongold has cutting edge for damn near every raid. 
---
But no, streamers are just shit at the game because you want to believe they are.
---
there will probably be an equal amount of people who want to play with them as there are people who want to play against / grief them, so itll be fairly balanced i think. im going to be avoiding the big streamer servers though personally, i dont wanna deal with the drawbacks of having that sort of community
---
Mortal Strike was OP in Vanilla until patch 1.7, when it was changed to use normalized weapon damage. Perhaps this is why you remember arms so fondly. It doesn't matter, because Classic WoW is on the 1.12 patch. So I think you need to take a long hard look at how your memories of the game are probably not going to hold up man.
---
I'd switch out the clips you have in the op to make it more obvious but yeah
---
*You will try*
---
Shaman.
---
When I started playing, my friends suggested Shaman, and as I had no clue about the game, I rolled one. Never liked it though. And I still hate totems to this day. Such a clunky mechanic.
---

10 hours to level 20 is pretty bad compared to today's standards, Also classic beta seems to be so much more easier for hunter, I was watching joana's stream and the mobs move really slow you can pretty much kite them forever if you want.
---
I really expected more from you, Alenya. You couldve done this in 7hours.
---
Oh man I totally forgot about Flintlocke.

And one of my favorites, looking for group. FOR PONY!!

---
Leveling as prot warrior, switching to arms at end game.
---
You have greater blessings, class wide buffs that last 15 minutes, in 1.12.  So, buff a max of 9 people, once before the boss pull, and you are done.
---
\*Pre-history
---
You‚Äôre right - I mostly do PvP nowadays, and my experience with m+5 probably isn‚Äôt a good enough reference since it‚Äôs relatively easy, and doesn‚Äôt need a ton of communication. I can see how communication and networking would be important with higher levels of m+, so I‚Äôll eat my words and accept that I‚Äôm wrong about that.
---
I‚Äôd still say that Vanilla as a whole requires more communication and coordination than retail in its current form (until you get to the hardcore content like m+ and non pug raids, obviously).
---
I don't even think there's enough room in the in-game bug reporter for this template, let alone the info you'd fill into it.
---
Has Blizzard stated as such or can it just be assumed that because a PC or Laptop can play BfA it can also play Classic? Thank you
---
That's the experience I had with Legion and BFA as well. During Legion alone I added around 30 people to my Bnet list, excluding guildies, just because I had awesome runs in M+ with them. Although a lot of them have quit by now (who can blame them?), I still talk to some of them from time to time. 
---
The main difference appears to be that, if you make friends with other players ingame, most of the socializing happens outside of the game.  If you run a high M+ key it is better to join a VoiP server. During Legion I was in a ton of those servers and even stuck around for an hour or two after a few runs just talking with those guys, adding them on steam.
---
My guess is also, that streamers have warped the social aspect of the game even more, especially the "ratail sceptics". Most of them either aren't in a guild, don't do anything with guildmates (at least on steam), have their set team mates for arena or only play with mods or viewers from their streams. All while most of the socializing happens in the more difficult content, which again, a lot of "retail sceptics" don't do.
---
pretty much this.
---
Millions will try, you dont have to pay anything, just install the game and try it for free.
---
But, let's be honest, 3hours for lvl 10 ... that right there is 70% of the players gone already.
---
Nobody said it *wasn't* gonna be a motherfucker. The fact that it's gonna be such a huge grind with unparalleled rewards is what *makes it appealing*.
---
Casuals don't understand these people WANT to waste literal weeks grinding bugs in the pursuit of the ultimate goal.
---
I plan on rolling a warrior and a Druid to try my hand at tanking on them. I started leveling right before TBC and spent most of the time from 60 onwards as holy with ret as an off spec. In BFA I‚Äôve been prot a lot more, and I‚Äôm looking forward to giving it a go in classic. I know it won‚Äôt be optimal, but if I can do 5 mans at 60, I‚Äôll be satisfied with that.
---
I call Sephiroth! Also Xsephirothx. Also Udlegolasx
---
Silver pine too I believe ;)
---
My friend got access just to see if he could. Doesn't have any interest in the beta at all. Wasted access there.
---
Try showing to someone who dosent know about that quest expect them to laff and wonder why they do not.
---
I prolly spent far longer getting all of those pages when I coulda moved onto another zone.
---
FER DE HERD
---
I don't consider said vanilla "problems" problematic. Realistically, almost all can be off-loaded on the community. The ones that cannot are just pains another class feels in their own way. And that pain lasts about as long as a single M+ run.
---
To fix those "problems" there are thing like a guild or the fact that your professions and time are sought after by others. 
---
Nowadays you do EVERYTHING yourself. The only way other people influence your progression is if they get a BoE, a BoE you will likely be unable to afford as there are not nearly enough money sinks in-game right now and everything is crazy inflated.
---
The finality of items, of course is the main problem here. There is a certain satisfaction when you lock in an item. Sure enough, there really is less grind if playing casually but if you are serious even slightly, you will be constantly bashing your head against steel walls.
---
If you watch the streams you will see that each day there seems to be another wave of invites going out (at least so far). I'd say chances are you will get in before the Beta is over, if they continue at this rate.
---
I've been checking my bnet almost hourly like a psycho and still nothing yet on my end :'(
---
I hate you.
---
I still remember that feeling though in the start of cataclysm when my Worgen was just a soldier for his home land
---
Until they forgot that storyline....
---
Yeah, I hear ya.  I only like Druid over Shaman because I actually prefer melee dps/tanking to ranged/heals.  Druid melee dps is meh with their generic hybrid spec, but it's not like it can't do anything. I also can tank dungeons, heal pvp, etc...I don't think there's one right answer, it always will come down to personal preference and playing something you enjoy.
---
I'm starting to lean more shaman though, because I would also like to have a dps/heal spec.  Druid is really dps/tank or tank/heal until much much later (and higher tiered gear comes out)
---
I will never forget the first time I saw these eyes.  I was running north of Raven Hill and thought a hidden mob was going to jump out and attack me.
---
I didn't sleep that night.
---
Great post. Thank you for taking the time to list all interesting things to do.
---
I am here to attack you personally, particularly because you are spreading a toxic perspective to people who might be scared about wanting to raid as a meme spec.
---
Just saying: ‚ÄúI presented facts and arguments...‚Äù does not mean you have done so, not does it make your baseless assumptions any less baseless.
---
The min max sensibility is not only inaccurate compared to the open minded raiders I dealt with in vanilla, it is also toxic and that is why I despise it.
---
It is toxic because it discourages people from playing the way they fucking want to, and is generally espoused by jerkoffs like yourself in an attempt to sound like you actually know what you are talking about.
---
Let people enjoy the game the way THEY want to enjoy it. It's a small minority of people that are actual going to go hard 12+ hours a day to get a week 1/2 rag kill, and that's enjoyable for them and has no bearing on how you play the game.
---
pretty sure fury will be bad in Vanilla since you don't abuse the pserver sit crit procs. 31/20 will probably be better
---
Oh my god go away with this experience shit already. When mobs deal not enough damage, it has zero to do with experience.
---
ah well I still see it, oh well.  Went looking for the clip of the incident and ya, its like a 3-3.5s swing timer for the boss so i still stick by the "for 10 seconds" that you said was extremely stupid as for soda not healing.  Tips only has 523 max HP, 2 broken pieces, no shield block, said nothing when charging in with healer at 50% mana... ya  getting smacked for 77% of your total hp wasnt going to end well for him [https://www.twitch.tv/tipsoutbaby/clip/HandsomeRefinedKimchiHumbleLife?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/tipsoutbaby/clip/HandsomeRefinedKimchiHumbleLife?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)
---
Above the play button in the launcher there is a drop down menu option. You select one ie WoW1 for yourself and WoW2 for your son. I assume you are also talking about 2 computers. I don't imagine you can do a split screen type thing if that's what you are thinking.
---
Don‚Äôt be a dick, if you don‚Äôt want to answer his question then just don‚Äôt.  You don‚Äôt have to tell someone they aren‚Äôt informed enough to ask a question.
---
Yeah these builds are definitely not intended for raiding as holy will be more useful there. I‚Äôm planning on having two paladins so the second one can heal when the time comes.
---
Sharding, what a great idea. It makes the game great, look at BFA. Thanks, Blizz! I knew you wouldn't let us down. From # No Changes, to sharding only in the starting zones for the first few days, to sharding the entire world for months.. Let's just shard the entire lifespan of Vanilla. That's the trend we're heading towards. The trend is your friend, until the end of the trend. I know you won't let us down, Blizz. Let's just put it on mobile only too, # Diablo Mobile !
---
Yeah but Duskwood has that creepy cemetery to deal with also... 
---
Which makes it a tad more spooky imo.
---
jea man
---
Ya but, either using a slow 1 handed or a 2 hander is still legit if you get 5 full stacks.
---
I'm not. I'm a long time alliance but switched to horde because of the upright orcs. Shaman is my main and I want to stay an orc shaman.
---
Its a monk isn't it?
---
but you eat your own cum?
---
Everyone in my guild is so angry its amazing
---
Yeah, as I feared, the experience will be far too easy compared to the Vanilla experience. 1.12 talents, no progressive itemization, mob damage undertuned.
---
layering is so anti-vanilla it hurts  
---
why cant they just remove layering day 0? just add multiple servers with the same name that will be merged in phase 2, like illidan-A, illidan-B, illidan-C. fuck this renamed sharding bs
---
I just feel like it would suck managing more compared to the rest.
---
Ask him if you can use it
---
Love2D
---
Yep, close it or leave it open, has no effect on the functionality of the launcher or the game as far as I can tell.
---
Pally is easy leveling. Right click a mob, seal up, throw up Asian Girl on Girl on the second monitor, repeat every 30 seconds.
---
I‚Äôve only played the horde, I‚Äôm going to play classic as alliance because I‚Äôve never seen that side of the lore.
---
This has been tested. Doesn't work
---
As much as I don't like any of this, it is definitely the best way to go about it.
---
?? 
---
There will obviously be a huge drop, the casual retail player wont get past the first 3 hours just to get to lvl 12. 
---
Autoattacking monsters for hours just to get past the first few levels, hello, this isn't 2004 anymore, ppl dont have time for this shit &lt;_&lt;
---
Lol, same exact thing here. If the price doesn't go down by the time I need another token I might log on and see if I have anything that will sell... I don't need much
---
Someone said something like "dudes phrase is tips out, and him and his boys wear make azeroth great again hat's in red, of course they're douche bags".
---
Legit even though everyone was shitting on dude, this one comment got down voted to shit. Weird
---
So fake. Just look at the two lower case L's in Blizzard.
---
Ah... Server 4... Layer 7... Shard 11...
---
Home...
---
Well in my opinion, it is toxic to be a spec that is ruining the experience of other players in the raid, for no reason at all. Wait I am sorry, the reason is "It was good in Vanilla before it got nerfed and other specs were buffed". 
---
I am not elitist about druid tanks (actually pretty dam good), or raid comp, or any of these other things. 
---
You gotta stop expecting everything to be exactly as you remember in Vanilla.  Why would people be open minded about a 20 year old game? Why are you not being open minded when I present many valid reasons why fury is better than arms?
---
Yeah Command is really nice for serving out justice. Good point about pursuit, that speed boost will be handy. 
---
I‚Äôm considering a build now that you mention it that avoids consecrate all together in favor of holy shield and imp ret Aura. 
---
Something like this. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVGtIgz0oVbezbb
---
I suppose next you're gonna tell me he doesn't know what Runescape or Counter Strike is.
---
For WoW specifically? Honestly I don't really follow many WoW streamers, my WoW life is pretty contained within my in-game networks and discords. I'd say Joana is probably a safe bet though his streams are pretty sparse, he did just get beta so they will likely pick up. He also created some of the most renowned levelling guides for classic and holds the current 1-60 world record.
---
Nobbel87 is also a good call if you enjoy the lore aspects and more casual stuff. He's pretty much the lore god, I'm not sure about his personality overall since, as I said, I don't tend to consume much WoW content that isn't pertinent to stuff I am doing.
---
Preach is probably also decent, he is definitely more on the side of a bit of banter, but he doesn't tend to go for the childish edgy meme type attitude. Good player, he also raided pretty consistently throughout the game's entire lifespan including vanilla so might have some more higher end insight? Not sure on that tbh.
---
Generally speaking I'd say just avoid the really big streamers. Those are usually going to be the ones that attract and pander to the type of stuff you're not a fan of I think.
---
I just skimmed the currently online streams so maybe someone else has others that are also more low-key / chill streamers. I think the best example I have off the top of my head would be Mathil, but he's a Path of Exile streamer. His streams are super chill though, love watching him.
---
Oh it does, back when BFA started and no one knew the dungeons I had this happen, you'd get rid of the shitters and replace them with friends or other people willing to give it a try. Can't say for sure now it still happens, with people knowing everything at this point, but I did have one mythic+ we had to complete with only 4 people because one of the dps was so bad we just ended up removing him after he refused to accept help and just didn't get anything.
---
The problem being, the game doesn't reward for mistakes at a high level and it probably shouldn't. Things aren't going to be like back then because most of these people playing classic will have friends/discord. When I was first starting out, I dont think I learned about Ventrillo until TBC and even then I didn't have a mic until Wrath (people are always amazed at how I type so fast at work and I have Warcraft 3 and WoW to thank).
---
I'm gonna have to say though, as an adult now, 6 hours for a dungeon isn't worth, especially when you have to keep going back to town to get another person who says they know what they are doing and then leave after one wipe because they pulled a mob everyone else snuck past.
---
This is geofencing of mobs. First time I saw it in vanilla was this exact spot. There are a few others in the game.
---
This happened in Vanilla. It's not sharding. It's not layering. It's mob geofencing.
---
Yeah that 30% block is pretty nice. 
---
What about something like this build? 
---
You guys are so delusional, it's insane
---
Try Pur roast. They make the beans to ha e less acid. It‚Äôs gentle on your stomach and a life saver for people like me who regular coffee goes right through. 
---
Another option is cold brew coffee. The long brewing process naturally reduces the acid in coffee. I brew mine at home store it in the fridge the. Heat it up before I drink it. Cold brew coffee is very smooth.
---
For a goblin that has only existed to play WoW for the last 15 years he's sure as fuck clueless about the most obvious things in classic.
---
When the demo was out with blizzcon he didn't even know how to shoot a fucking bow.
---
exact same here, i feel its going to be that way until the second we log on classic!
---
One reason I stopped playing Minecraft was the constant refresh of maps. No Survival server would ever stick to the same map. Kids were always insistent on fresh starts.
---
Got any proof it happened in vanilla? I see it happen on nostalrius based pservers but I don't recall anything nearly this bad happening on vanilla
---
Thanks for posting my vid man, glad someone liked.
---
I‚Äôve tried cold brew but have been too lazy to make it myself.  Will try the Pur roast though, thanks!
---
Have horrid gird, but also have horrid coffee addiction.  You‚Äôre a lifesaver!
---
This is what made me go from "It will be big enough for satisfy Activision executives" to "This is likely the next big thing".
---
Same here, i feel like an insane person, but i cant help myself.
---
Perfectly understandable that they aren't including one, it's a superfluous ruleset. They all inevitably get overrun with ppv kang male undead rogue dudebros.
---
I‚Äôm just sending Light‚Äôs Hope rolling different classes to pick a main. Have a few 19-29 twinks for PvP too. I won‚Äôt bother getting to 60 but it‚Äôs fun to play in the mean time and test out classes.
---
Only fucking morons would believe it's a "true" world first. It's a joke. People are excited about the first glimpses of their favorite old dungeons. Let them be excited.
---
Ask him if I can use it :)
---
Most of these content creators were literally children when the game released. Not a knock against them, but it's something to keep in mind when they speak about the game and how much they remembered it.
---
BoA items (as in, the desgnation of it) didn't come into existence until Wrath.
---
Blizzard confirmed, that things like collector's edition items will be given to those who also have them on live, as long as they existed in Vanilla. Since the murloc costume did not exist in vanilla but was added with patch 2.1.3 it won't be in Classic. Since loot card ingame rewards from the TCG were implemented with the TBC pre-patch they won't be in Classic either.
---
Happens in pugs too when things go well. "Hey that healer/tank/dps did really well, we can try to bring him back next week"
---
Can't see downvotes yet, but I'm sure fanboys hit you hard :\^)
---
I get the trepidation, but it becomes second nature
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a tough catch 22. Using seal of wisdom helps with mana but has less threat, definitely not ideal for longer raid fights. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm mostly focusing on 5 mans and air grinding.
---
Thats not layering, people really need to listen to the devs explanation of layering..
---
Disagreed. I have been playing Private servers on and off for years. Classic will be a solid 20 years of content for us casuals who take months off at a time and just want our shit left right where we left it upon return.
---
Not sure where I'm parked on retail nor if my characters still exist. Last thing I remember was running Trial of the Crusader 25 before logging off forever.
---
According to how they explained layering this shouldn't even be possible, so clearly someones wrong.
---
Doing the same on Horde.
---
nope, not reading your salty replies, bye!
---
Sodapoppin and asmongold and esfand got in for advertisement, but Joana getting in is a huge plus for the game.
---
&gt; I never said you couldn't choose who you group with. I said the exact opposite in fact. You can't, however, behave in an elitist manner and then claim you're not an elitist.
---
If something as minor as choosing who you group with is elitist to you, you're watering down the meaning so much that it's practically meaningless and let me point out, you admitted to do the exact same thing, in fact, I'd argue that your requirements are waaaay more elitist than mine.
---
Your requirements: Spend hours upon hours farming consumables to join my group
---
My requirements: When arbitrarily choosing between 2 buttons, please select the one that doesn't make you a detriment to the people you're grouping with.
---
&gt; ou have consistently and repeatedly said that you consider people who play an off spec to be committing a personal affront to you. 
---
You're making this up, not once have I said anything remotely close to this.
---
&gt; I repeat, you consider people playing the game in a manner you personally do not approve of to be an insult to you 
---
And I repeat, you're making this up, not once have I said anything remotely close to this.
---
&gt; You further claimed there is an objective, correct, official standard on how to play the game, and when I mockingly pressed you onto providing proof of this, you could not.
---
Yea, the correct way is to play the game how you have fun without it being a detriment to others.
---
&gt; while deriding those who choose to play an off spec as intentionally being a dick to you and you personally as their sole motivation for doing so.
---
Well, despite me asking several times, you have been unable to provide me with a single other thing that might motivate people to do so, had you done so you could've ended the discussion right there, really, I find it odd, that despite you being able to come up with one for this long you still insist that one might exist.
---
&gt; You are a prime example of someone who puts "higher numbers" over everything else.
---
Nope, I'm a prime example of someone who puts **INTENTIONALLY** lower numbers below everything else, if you can't tell the difference between the two then there's seriously something wrong with you, but I must remind you, not 2 posts ago, you did what you're just accusing me of.
---
Literal autists have a hard time picking up on sarcasm, jokes, figures of speech, etc.
---
I'm seeing some connection here.
---
I‚Äôve always been horde as well so I thought I‚Äôd give alliance a turn. Every time I seriously thought about rolling alliance I‚Äôd just vomit uncontrollably until I pass out.
---
From what i've seen, everyone who has gotten an invite outside of influencers and friends and family, had a vanilla account from either 2004 or 2005. As a 2006 scrub is there anyone who has gotten an invite that also started in 06?
---
I love how he (the CS rep) was trying to be superclear to get an end to this confusion and we're still as confused as before :D
---
Going to be honest.  When you say thousands....  that's not even enough to fill one server.  And only a small % will come back.
---
Out of all the issues the beta has this is really low priority.
---
Why do you say that? I played pally in vanilla and I don‚Äôt remember too much
---
Rank 14 might be attainable for real tryhards, but your average joe isnt skilled enough for that. Better off using that time talking shit in /trade instead tbh.
---
Wow, that'd be so sad if they don't add one. I've always wanted to play on one and have my heart set on it at hte moment
---
I distinctly remember you could not, good catch
---
The Streamer Imbalance in way of population AND economy are going to effect the server they roll on Drastically.
---
Yeah you gonna assign his gender next?
---
you guys are funny.
---
"Blizzard will never do classic, it's a shit game, muh wall of no".
---
Blizzard &gt; rerelease classic
---
"No one will play anyway, shit game"
---
Classic -&gt; Tops the twitch hype
---
"There will be no player after 1month, shit game, ppl don't have time"
---
What's the next excuse?
---
If you do the math knowing these folks are in their twenties, they were literally children when the game released. It's hard to expect much from them unless they were playing a ton on private servers.
---
If one is going to be a ghost town then they shouldn't have another layer.
---
Weird because I saw asmon Jump from top of sentinel hill and lost half his HP, which seemed correct
---
I thought the joke was that they're calling out world firsts of incredibly trivial and insignificant things, not simply the idea of calling out world firsts : P
---
Nah I'll probably play on ultra settings. Layering actually negatively impacts the gameplay.
---
One of my most embarassing memories from early WoW was my first character, a rogue, there was a Kazzak raid on Ironforge and I didn't realise unequipping my gear would save it from durability hits when I died.  
---
All my gear was broken, and I didn't have enough money to repair, so I had to go punch some level 10 mobs (I was around level 45-50) to gather enough change to repair my shit.
---
Asmon never played on private servers, ever. Or at least it never said so to my knowledge.
---
You have to remember cataclysm released about 8.5 YEARS ago. The world they're playing in hasn't been around for almost 9 years, of course they're gonna forget some of the shit that was in it.
---
I really don't think so. Sure, player numbers would be lower on each game, but numbers on private servers have already proven that it's entirely possible to keep a healthy community alive and well if you just concentrate the playerbase.
---
Fuck no. 0% chance.
---
I'm pretty sure banning someone because they don't share your opinion on a game mechanic is the actual toxic behavior, but keep on fighting the good fight young paladin.
---
Well maybe you should say hi, might lead to running with some of those people again if you find that they've done well enough.
---
I've heard this a lot, and as someone who only started caring about getting good at Warrior after it went away, I am looking forward to learning it.
---
He plays retail. Don't worry I tried, even though its against ToS.
---
Jesus, maybe the guy actually wanted to enjoy the damn game. This is why classic will never be the same as actual Vanilla, because your mindset is the norm now. Min max every second of your gameplay or why bother.
---
Classic pun
---
Nah BBY. The level 60 mount required a fuck ton of cloth, mats and a few hundred gold to create the reins.
---
Yes - it‚Äôs very doable.  Obviously slower than a DPS spec, but 100% doable.
---
It‚Äôs a reasonable first run imo. We‚Äôve been checking and making notes against the guide to prep a beta tested update. Once I get home from overseas I‚Äôll stream a proper run üëç
---
I get hard at the idea of all the options warriors have with stance dancing.
---
We should have a list so i can avoid streamer servers like the plague.
---
It just requires a lot of work to get warriors going. They are more then worth it. If you have the time but, warriors take time to brew.
---
Having the constants from the database tables isn't the only thing they need. The base game engine functions that the values feed into have changed so bringing back those tables won't necessarily result in the same final regen rates if the dependent formulas are not modified correctly from the bfa engine which could end up breaking other things.
---
I'd imagine they'd transform the old constants tables using outputs of the old functions to produce similar results with the new functions. This impacts more than just regen rates.
---
Tauren look great but personally not a fan of their casting animations. Kind of a lose-lose here since you're looking for non-slouching orcs. Sorry my man :\
---
Keep it mind swapping weapons incurs a GCD and all the interrupts (except Counterspell) are on the GCD in vanilla.
---
Oh man, this revived my Classic hype 100%, this is fantastic!
---
scroll down, quite a few of those.
---
&gt;i think it‚Äôs going to kill Retail    
---
&gt;it will be a lot more popular than BFA    
---
&gt;as much as 8 million will be on Classic launch    
---
&gt;Blizzard is acting like there will be a huge drop in player numbers after release but it could very much be the 
---
opposite
---
Purroast coffee is great. I buy it on amazon all the time. It‚Äôs coffee without the diarrhea afterwards.
---
At least retail. I stopped playing before sunwell and then got back for few weeks in wotlk. But I more or less leveled to 80 and that was it.
---
But i played on classic private Server for two year until u stopped a bit over a year ago.
---
No warlock love
---
The main reason for this, I believe, is also the reason why I will probably remember legion fondly.
---
Legion had a bunch of minor improvements over WoD and after a long time we had the opportunity to do proper class content.
---
Realistically, legion was filled with content. Might not be the one I, and most others here like, but I still had something to do every time I logged in.
---
Of course playing with a close friend on a super casual schedule did help but yeah, the moment we went full hardcore in NH and ToS it all quickly fell apart I'll admit.
---
If you think of streamers as more of radio personalities, it begins to make a lot more sense why people watch them.
---
Asmon did a strawpoll one time and found that the majority of his viewers *don't even play the game he streams 99% of the time*. A lot of people watch him strictly for his opinions and his personality.
---
Wine 4.x?
---
I stayed in one zone. Sorry just super tired
---
Don‚Äôt think so. Wouldn‚Äôt make sense for them to put it behind an expansion pay wall for people just to come back.
---
I still have that on my old priest in retail! It's from a quest in Ashenvale I believe. The wand is called Dartol's Rod of Transformation. Alliance only though.
---
Alenya is a speedrunner, shes not trying to enjoy the game.
---
It's more then worth it. Warrior was my go to class for years. No other class is as rewarding. Theirs a reason why it has some of the most die hard fans. Every time you think you have them solved. You realize their's a whole nother level to delve into.
---
Not required but you have a low chance because I haven‚Äôt really seen any new subs get into the beta, so far only day ones and 2004/2005 accounts I was hoping to get in also just subbed like a week ago
---
It's alright. I want to stay horde because I love my shaman and never played one in classic. I'll figure something out.
---
THis is me, but then tomorrow I realize that priest and pally are options too and I have to start over.
---
Considering alliance and all that, yeah it is üòÇ but wands are bae for casters so they need to be a priority
---
Without the dedication of many developers over the years and core leaks, nostalrious wouldn't have happened, they just picked the work of other devs and improved the database side plus a few fixes here and there, but let me tell you, they also had bugs that other servers fixed long time ago.
---
Nost core was really crap full of bugs that you could notice right away, but I give credit to them for having the idea of patch progression which was one of the reasons they got famous for.
---
This spot is weird on private servers too same thing happens. Issue between phasing between durotar and barrens with mobs in between
---
You know... versions of wine that are in the 4.0 major version? Not that hard to understand...
---
4.1, 4.2, .... 4.8, etc.
---
&gt;I still have issues coming to terms with the fact that people are willing to intentionally make the game worse for their group members and other people are okay with that.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that just because someone chooses to run a ‚Äúsub optimal‚Äù spec (or whatever spec they ducking want for that matter) does not necessarily mean they are even making it any ‚Äúworse for their group members‚Äù in any measureable way, nor that it is your business if they are.
---
It is just as difficult for me to ‚Äúcome to terms‚Äù with some people thinking they are justified in telling others how to fucking spec, and then justifying it by claiming the choice makes things more difficult for the group (which we have already established isn‚Äôt even necessarily the case)
---
I have seen your reasoning several times today and it is infuriating, and not at all in line with the open minded sensibility that was in real vanilla.
---
i just sent them a support ticket asking for clarification
---
Well Soda said he wants to be on the same server as Asmon as the opposite faction, and those are probably the only 2 streamers that are big enough to really make that much of a different.
---
Have any new subs got in really would like to know?
---
You can't just "patch out" all of the negative impacts of layering. It is logically bad for the game. The only reason to support it is to give up a decent part of what makes vanilla special for a bit of questionable QOL. You'll maybe have 20 minutes of a queue skipped in exchange for hours of gameplay affected. It is absolutely antithetical to vanilla WoW.
---
I‚Äôll keep it in mind! We still got 3 months of preparation before anything definitive lol
---
You.... know what a beta is right?
---
Doesn't contain any boa items
---
Man, life has got to be tough for someone who cant even stand a little reddit argument lol.  "mean words hurt your feelings so il use that excuse to ignore facts about my obviously incorrect statment" lol
---
If there are layering issues coming up with a server with barely a few hundred people imagine how fucked it will be when we have thousands.
---
Dude if you really want to rush a character. Play a warrior, fastest leveling char in the whole game! I swear! Believe me!
---
It was.
---
Not if you rebind it to something else ;)
---
The key one of these drops is jumping down to the entrance to molten core from the ledge above, instead of walking down the chain.  Rogues can do it.  Guildies imitating that rogue, not so much.
---
You keep saying shit like "the counter of X is to do Y!" while completely neglecting that the other class is just as easily capable of doing the same thing.
---
If the counter to a Hunter is to just FAP/Sprint, then the Hunter can FAP/Cheetah to keep as much distance as he can. Scatter/Trap the Rogue (he can't trinket it and it's not blocked by FAP), keep Hunter's Mark and Track Hidden up. Keep a DoT up to keep the Rogue out of Stealth. When FAP is down, the Rogue loses.
---
Morladim is even scarier.
---
Cool, thanks. I plan to main tank since that‚Äôs what I did in my guild during BC. My memories of vanilla are hazy but I remember leveling 1-60 as ret with a sword and board because that‚Äôs what paladins used in WC2. And I even got invited to raids like that! It was really fun back when no one knew what they were doing lol
---
Is that the US Malorne? I was on there for a good portion of vanilla (after a free transfer from Deathwing). It was one of the lowest population realms.
---
What about the pets? The mini diablo etc.
---
That's the danger of leveling too fast. In retail as it currently is you can walk into a dungeon with a PUG and clear it without deaths. In vanilla if it was everyone's first run through you could guarantee at least one wipe at some point and frequently couldn't even finish it. That's what was so great about it, actually took some skill. And you would earn a reputation based off of your skills, that too was a great thing about vanilla.
---
FYI, you replied to two of my posts, so i'm replying to both here to save time.
---
I'm looking forward to it myself, actually.
---
I want to see what ingenious strats people pull out of their asses to power-game it. I know somebody somewhere has something figured out.
---
You can have rose-tinted glasses and still be dedicated. I saw some of that in the Beta stream where people were leveling up and dedicating for it and super pumped and then, usually around Barrens or Westfall going "Man, this is taking longer than I remember".
---
That doesn't mean they'll quit or that I even want them to. I just think that it won't be what they remember, and possibly more importantly, it won't be the same as on the private servers.  Whether some of those differences are intentional or bugs is unknown.  As an example, I heard about some people trying to use a graveskip that worked on private and didn't work here and screwed over some people.  Another example would be mobs hitting harder than they were used to (possibly a bug) and wiping on content they weren't used to wiping on in private servers.
---
I wish those crackheads the best, I really do, and I'll cheer on people who make it and sub to streamers and donate 5 bucks to say "Gratz you crazy fucko" or if i'm in their guild i'll feed them what meager things I have on my casual play.  But I *hope* it won't be as easy as they are expecting.  I don't want to see a Rag 1 clear, but I'd be over the fucking moon on a Week 2 or Week 3 clear, even if the Week 2 clear is that tuesday night after server reset.
---
I *like* hard content. I like grinds. I like things that can't be beaten in a single day or week.
---
I know they'll never do this, but I want them to give Ragnaros more mechanics that he didn't have in Vanilla. I want to walk into MC and see that Baron Geddon's bomb goes on multiple people simultaneously.  I want to see that Garr's adds respawn if he's not killed in time. Etc, Etc.  I don't want to just walk over MC or Ony or ZG or BWL with all the old mechanics.
---
Happy cake day sir
---
PLEASE GOD THIS
---
They would all be US. Firetree was my main. I am going to log in and check out my toons tonight
---
They're bop.
---
To all the naysayers: WOW has NEVER had more Twitch viewers that it did this week. For closed beta deadmines runs. That speaks for itself.
---
It happening on pservers doesn't mean it's not sharding. Nost implemented a zone sharding system to deal with the fact that they had 5x the number of people playing on one server as a blizzlike server would.
---
This is also me, I feel your pain
---
Send help
---
Shit like this is why Im playing on a pvp server
---
I mean, not really. They aren't selling the game again, they are giving you all of this EXTRA to what people would normally pay anyways. Blizz hasn't been very considerate to their fan base in a long time imo, but this is definitely a step in the right direction.
---
Huh, there you go then OP no BoA in classic
---
He might roll Alliance anyway. Earlier he said he prefers Night Elves but his friend wants to play a Shaman so hes stuck being a cow.
---
Ironically, the great "Wall of no" had a pretty good summary of the broad strokes changes. XD
---
if a big shot joins your server you're fucked
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
People seem to be glossing over a lot of important shit. 
---
- If you level arms, the big stalling out is that Mortal strike is the bread of butter of that build. A large amount of your abilities revolve around your attack speed. So you can't even spend your rage if you've got a lot built up, additionally you can't earn rage that quickly if you aren't taking damage. If you go arms, keep in mind that spamming Slam to burn rage is very useful over Heroic Strike because Slam actually hits faster than your auto attack speed. 
---
- Fury has quicker hits for smaller amounts of rage gain. Using a shield low level allows you to shield bash casters to stop their spells, which is huge. You wont get pummel till post level 30, which is a long-ass time to not be able to interrupt spells. 
---
- Everyone saying the "don't dual wield" thing seems to skip over the fact that if you're struggling with too many misses on a mob, you can just use an ability. The dual wield miss rate *ONLY APPLIES TO AUTO ATTACKS.* You want a majority of your hits to come from abilities anyways. 
---
- People talking about swapping talents in the middle are missing a huge problem and that is gearsets and weapon skills. If you swap from 2h to dual wield or whatever, you will have to re level the weapon skills. And in Classic, basically every weapon is broken up. So if you're using a 2h till 40 then swap to 1h, you're going to have to grind your weapon skill up and it will bring your leveling to a screeching halt for some time. Definitely not advisable if you're this worried about crunching the numbers for speed leveling. 
---
- The big problem with raiding fury is your item sets. Most of the warrior item sets do not benefit fury. Additionally, you're competing with other classes that need the weapons, mainly rogues. There was kind of a preference where people didn't want certain classes with them because they knew if they took a fury warrior with a rogue, you could roll on the same gear. So people wanted to bring an arms warrior and a rogue so you both rolled on different items.
---
100% THIS!!!! The game is only fun when you get to enjoy it with other people, and like 80% of the content isn't endgame.
---
Or at least if you're going to power level a character. Call it a win once you hit 60 and use it for occasional high end raiding, but maybe go make a new character and play through at a more sedate pace so you can lend to the populated immersive world feeling.
---
Divine protection.  That is what makes alliance easier than than horde in high end raiding during vanilla.
---
&gt; long ass-time
---
^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https://xkcd.com/37)
---
hahaha
---
All I know is I'm going on the server that neither of them are on.
---
I know exactly what you're talking about with that specific spot, I had the same experience a couple times too. But I can't ever recall mobs you were actively fighting phasing out like in this clip.
---
The real vanilla was the friends we made along the way!
---
What do you mean? We filled six in retail. Between returners and people who want to try for the first time, there's more than enough to sustain a single server.
---
Naturally rates will be different because spirit scaling was changed somewhere during TBC.
---
The idea of the tool is to provide reference. For example with examined values I've gathered so far the difference has been 2-5 hp / tick. My personal belief is that this difference will only grow as higher you get.
---
So in other words as long as classic is below 2.4 values its not wrong or too high as people have described.
---
It clearly demonstrates him being phased, layering has multiple phases of the same continents when load demands it.
---
just shut up, you're just mad and clearly not thinking straight. It clearly is a bug from a system they have just made. An entirely new thing, if they can't fix it, you bet your ass it's gonna be gone. But hey, what's the point of using logic when you can just be mad.
---
Yeee, abusing that got me a 24 hour ban, never again in PvP.  
---
Though, used it a lot when jumping down to MC.
---
Those character animations don't look vanilla.
---
You can love someone even if they look like someone else. Xd
---
Hate to sound like a know it all, but no, this will be exactly as big as I expected -- gargantuan.
---
Nope. Burn out is a real thing. Even if I got in I wouldn't use it. August isn't far away.
---
I am not sure if you are playing a warrior or paladin in classic as your comments are unclear. However the fastest way to level a warrior is with a 2 handed weapon. You use hamstring to slow them. Then weave in and out of melee range in between swings. You will have a much slower swing timer then the mob. You your one for one trades will favor you by a lot.
---
i'll give him 3 bj's
---
Most people bind it to somethibg else. My interrupt is there.
---

you just have 0 proof, if he really did send death threats then 5 minutes on google would have your proof for you. but you can't find any. because you are just believing tips when he says that alex did it.

More relevant than any pserver baby thinking they know about vanilla when they only know about pserver wrong info.

Yes, it's nice to brush up against greatness and even occasionally rise to greatness as a character in an MMO, but it has to come at a hefty price, otherwise it just feels ridiculous.
---
It's hard enough to swallow the "oooh you're so special" routine in single player games... in an MMO it's just pathetic. The only way for the story to make any sense is to treat the characters as vagabond mercenary/adventurer types.

I can't overstate how proud and honored I feel when meeting people who carry the cross by living with unmistakable truth. I'm sure there's many things you love about your country but you underscore your personal strength by recognizing the societal ills, like the putin trap.

Honestly, as someone who lives through and loved vanilla WoW, as well as a veteran of EQ‚Äôs TLP servers, I can tell you for sure that 80% of the launch population will be gone within 60 days.

Oh word, I meant to say that I‚Äôll be playing warrior. I saw that Kargoz guide that explains the hamstring thing, it‚Äôs really exciting! So arms until 60 for leveling and then respec to prot around max level?
---
Thank you, that means a lot :)
---
My thunderfury agrees with you.  Also, I have more than a 1/2 year played on my main by the time of the first expansion.  I got addicted hard.
---
I mean, I had both sets in vanilla. I know I'll likely do some pve, I just don't want that to be my main focus. Last time I was split down the middle with nowhere really to go. I was helping my friends clear content solely so I could compete in pvp.

Are they releasing invites to the beta in waves daily or is it more of over the course of weeks?
---
Yeah and I hope they continue to. The russians, chinese, and toxic morons can keep their free shit.
---
I haven't played since Tomb of Sargeras in Legion, but from what I remember people would leave the LFG finder before the boss was even looted. Especially tanks / healers who just fast queue for the daily or the additional bag thing you got sometimes.
---
Just get your hit homie
---
I normally level as two handed fury but, to be honest I don't know which is better. I am very good at warrior end game but, leveling has always just been something I do. I never tried to figure out the best thing.
---
General reasoning:
---
Vast majority (PVE, Items, dungeons, quests) of the game content is pre-60.
---
What makes the game fun is having more people in an area to interact with.
---
Getting to 60 fast is fun.
---
But once you get to 60 you get into repetitive content. And with you being 60, that's one less person for the world to interact with within pre-60 content.
---
Better to say that everyone's reasoning isn't so much what's "More fun"... moreso "What will make it stay fun the longest)
---
lol people are scolding you for not seeing an announcement for a game by chance
---
but yeah only 3 more months dude, gonna be good stuff. the dev team behind it seems really passionate and aware of what needs to be done.
---
You know nothing of game design and how it can either foster a community and social interactions or deter it.
---
If it's appearing this buggy now, there's some chance 'removing it' won't 100% do the job.
---
Yeah its totally normal for the mob you're fighting and the mobs you killed to suddenly disappear and a new set suddenly spawn. 
---
As someone with the beta I'm playing other games still. The beta is an amazing flashback and I cant wait for its full release. I just dont wana burn myself out (stopped at lvl 15).
---
alright lets see it. ANY successful pvper playing SM /RUIN
---
it doesnt do more damage because you dont get to freecast shadowbolts when your squishy as fuck.
---
SL/Nightfall is the go to premade spec for most people and conflag is the ONLY other spec people play if they actually give a shit about pvp.
---
the only other spec even worth mentioning is soul link shadowburn that some people like to play in AB specifically.
---
&gt;Not at all. You'll see more SM/Ruin locks than SL/NF and Conflag locks combined.
---
i agree. because its a pve spec that people dont wanna pay 100g to respec out of, just like you see fury warriors all the time. it doesnt make it good nor viable
---
Since I‚Äôm most likely not getting into the beta I‚Äôm playing on a private server.
---
My guess is there is a reason they are dropping it between 8.2 and 8.3 because it will fill the lul period between live content as well. The launch will be huge for sure but I'd expect and it seems they do as well for the first few months to be a roller coaster playerbase.
---
Private servers go through that too though there is something really cool about joining into a brand new mmo server which WoW hasn't done in any expac for a long time.
---
It's Durotar and, it's not close. However if you are ally as you seem to be. Human, 80% of the ally faction is normally human lol.
---
I did not mind WoD... I got close to 700k gold out of that expansion...
---
I am not certain about the time aspect people keep mentioning. 
---
The gearing path in PvE is rather simple. Get to raiding and attend raid times for like 3-4 hours twice a week. Most raiding guilds do that ATM and it's not for any meaningful progression but just because they can? While back then you could still do it just because you can and actually progress your pixels.
---
PvP is a bit of a different animal, but it's not like you can't compete if you just raid here and there or buy good gear. Most PvE gear is stronger that PvP gear and it's generally rather easy to get. So you say you are performance based? Then I guess rank 14 doesn't really bother you. In that case I don't really get the grindy aspect of PvP. I mean, you might as well melt R14s as a rank 7 if performance is your thing.
---
Literally the only thing I care about
---
Blizzard haven't verified if the player regen or dungeon mob damages are correct yet.
---
But some mobs seems to be doing a lot of damage, while others are doing basically no damage. Spell-casters should also be way stronger than most melee mobs  in terms of damage.
---
They also changed the naming on spell damage, instead of saying + shadow damage or + frost damage etc. It says + frost spell power or something like that
---
Well the money problem started with that stupid Garrison, they should have left it like the farm where you got a minimum amount of profession materials to help with professions, not give everyone free gold then people realized they could do that on the maximum character amounts per server and abused the RAF. 
---
I do agree with some things being way more grindy (required to do mythic+ to remain competitive until you clear the raid), doing those stupid weeklys for that stupid Artifact (thankfully this was removed, although replaced with something similar in BFA, thanks Diablo members who worsened WoW).
---
I'm still trying to think about your comment about everything being done yourself, I mean back then a lot you had to do yourself as well, no one was giving away free enchantments (people leveling were for tips), and most pvp and raid groups required them (plus they looked really cool back then). I think some professions had BOP BIS gear which you really had to make yourself or pay exhorbitant prices for someones daily/weekly cooldown. (Though it was interesting that certain items could be made only at certain places, but you lost a lot of time or a day to just doing that).  
---
I've liked WoW through all of its expansions, each had it's good and its bad. I can't imagine playing the game without a guild/group of friends (yet thats the problem im seeing is all these people now wanting more and more single player crap, like the class challenges, while interesting we don't need more of it).
---
I wont group for collect quests (except the ones where it's 1 mob who drops an item for everyone) since most of the time it doesn't help because you can't both loot the item, but yeah for kill quests especially in a heavily farmed or pvp area you gotta stick together.
---
&gt; If something as minor as choosing who you group with is elitist to you, you're watering down the meaning so much that it's practically meaningless and let me point out, you admitted to do the exact same thing, in fact, I'd argue that your requirements are waaaay more elitist than mine.
---
So you don't mind if a guy in your raid doesn't have resistance gear, just so long as he isn't a filthy, subhuman off spec?  
---
You are literally telling people how to play their class down to individual talent point placement.  That's not "minor" in any way.
---
&gt; You're making this up, not once have I said anything remotely close to this.
---
Yes you have.  Many, many, many times.
---
&gt; Yea, the correct way is to play the game how you have fun without it being a detriment to others.
---
You define "being a detriment to others" as "not playing the game by the official rules I just made up."  At this point dude, just straight up fuck you, you elitist scum.
---
&gt; Well, despite me asking several times, you have been unable to provide me with a single other thing that might motivate people to do so, had you done so you could've ended the discussion right there, really, I find it odd, that despite you being able to come up with one for this long you still insist that one might exist.
---
What part of "people don't need to justify their decisions on how they play a game to you" do you not understand?  In reality, they're probably doing it because it's fun and makes them happy.  Which is a damn sight more likely than your batshit insane claim that they're doing it to intentionally piss you off.
---
&gt; Nope, I'm a prime example of someone who puts INTENTIONALLY lower numbers below everything else, if you can't tell the difference between the two then there's seriously something wrong with you, but I must remind you, not 2 posts ago, you did what you're just accusing me of.
---
At this point I'm just going to start reporting you for trolling.  If you're serious, you're the worst kind of player and you and your kind are the reason the MMORPG market is as fucked as it is.
---
They've acknowledged this is not the correct behavior and have marked it as a bug they are actively monitoring.

This is a known issue that we are actively investigating. Please continue to report these types of mob-behavior if they are happening in other locations."

---
I agree this looked like a respawn of two enemies to me
---
They admittedly become aggressive too quickly, normally they wait a second or two before attacking, but this seemed like wrong place wrong time, mob respawned
---
Probably
---
Yeah, his guide mentioned going fury and macroing /sit to get critted to proc enrage. I‚Äôm just trying to make these next few months go by by imagining my future character haha
---
This dungeon was actually today. The community is still there they are all just playing on private servers after they, like myself, just got too fed up with current WoW at some point.
---
Here is the thing.  You're target is still the same.  You auto attacks are still hitting that mob you have the combo points on.  You are doing an ability that is hitting something that is not your target.  Since you never switch targets, you never lose your points.
---
Not if you have this juicy boi https://classicdb.ch/?item=17076
---
Yeah, then when Asmongold rage quits because he got ganked too many times (Literally almost happened yesterday with that Hunter 1v3ing them) and all of his plebs quit with him. GG Server...
---
I agree and appreciate the small guide. But the reasoning could be better.
---
It's that the game as a whole will eventually become less fun with time as more and more people bump up against the end game 60 content.
---
We will eventually see pre-60 content become a ghost town and find it difficult to get groups to run anything below 40+ if you decide to start a new character.
---
So... why rush it? That's my reasoning. I want to lend to the population that keeps the game running as long as possible before entropy sets in and we find the next thing to play.
---
8/05 here with active sub and no invite. I Don't think they're just inviting everyone by year and moving up, there's still an element of randomness
---
Ladies and gentlemen. Vanilla wow.

This looks so much better than the actual client... blizzard needs to hire you. 10/10 take my upvote!

Wtf is AT? Never heard of it.
---
Best PvPers in the world were still playing in MoP, so.
---
Wrath PvP skilled lolololol. Did you PvP in Wrath? Wizard Cleave took skill? DKs took skill? Shadowmourne DKs/Pallys/Warriors took skill? Wrath PvP was all about blowing people up.
---
&gt; does not necessarily mean they are even making it any ‚Äúworse for their group members‚Äù in any measureable way
---
Man, you're gonna freak the fuck out when you discover a stopwatch, it will blow your mind that time can, in fact, be measured.
---
&gt; with some people thinking they are justified in telling others how to fucking spec,
---
No one is telling anyone how to spec, they're just telling them the consequences of their spec choice.
---
&gt;and not at all in line with the open minded sensibility that was in real vanilla.
---
I'm not sure we played the same vanilla if you experienced a different mindset back then.
---
The music in duskwood was so good. Really made it feel haunted and evil.
---
Why? The people that you should be thanking are the ones that dedicated thousands of hours to emulate the servers to the point that allowed Nost to happen at all.
---
Nost team just picked a public core and applied the idea of patch progression. The rest was just good timing and the current state of retail WoW that led to Classic WoW.
---
The only good thing Nost did was the amount of time they spent on improving the database, the patch progression system, and a better use of Warden, because the core itself was full of bugs and hacks that were quite visible while playing and were mostly fixed by other teams after the shutdown. In the end the core is as good as trash and many devs know it, but it's what they have for now.
---
Nost deserves some credit but please don't ignore all the work that many teams had to endure since alpha wow, which I have the impression, that many people on reddit appear to just ignore completely.
---
Watch your profamity
---
yes, you'll be fine. you'll just be killing slower then a DPS spec; noticeably, in some cases, but it's completely viable. i did my original vanilla play through as a Restoration Druid.
---
this one hit me so hard in the feels.. that drive home from EB Games with the burning crusade... OOF
---
You're not alone... i open other games up and close them before i even start... nothing i mean NOTHING has my interest atm.
---
I have the beta but I'm also not going to play it, I only opted in for the giggles. I will 100% play on release though.
---
4 Bj's over here bob.
---
The unrealistic thing I'm seeing with the scepter quest is that people think they can solo the bug grinding. It's a guild effort and chances are most of those people don't have a full raiding guild backing them and willing to grind for them to get a the scepter.
---
The WoW community has always been very, very defensive of Blizzard. So I doubt it.
---
Ooo stream sniping. Didn't even think about that. Even more of a reason for them to do it. Absolute chaos restricted to one realm.
---
HEY BABY DID EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?
---
 They've acknowledged this is not the correct behavior and have marked it as a bug they are actively monitoring.
---
Awesome, thanks for the heads up.
---
It is very measurable. As a mage, you will watch your dps drop dramatically when Nightfall or Ignite gets knocked off the target. Go look up how Ignite works and educate yourself. You are fcking all of the mages at once by knocking off one debuff. All of their crits feed into this one massive ticking DoT and they work hard to grow that DoT all fight, just for your MS to knock it off.   
---
How about you be open minded and think about that for more than 2 seconds?
---
worded it such *than* what?
---
I think the streamers will coordinate with each other and split up across different factions to try and balance things out. Whether it works at all is another matter.
---
Though I do remember adding some exceptional players in Legion the feeling was just never the same. Since a lot of it is cross server groups you never just run into them out in the world doing whatever. I miss little moments like that.
---
It will be hilarious to watch though. I can't wait for that, just don't want to be apart of it. Haha
---
The majority of people who are rushing to 60 are most likely fully aware of how much content there is in classic wow. So it's unlikely they will be the ones to have an issue.
---
I understand that Mr. Tough Guy. The OP states he is using "staging" and I thought that was the term for the bleeding edge, newest version. But I guess it isn't?
---
I think it will mostly just make Molten Core easier tbh, Onyxia and BWL are mostly so threat sensitive that you can't even use debuffs most of the time anyways.
---
But the thing that would be cool was that if post nax they cancelled any plans for the dogshit TBC expansion, and removed the debuff cap entirely on the new content to let vanilla run wild
---
Holy hell I hope your cancer stays in retail.
---
same thats why i watch streams of it all day until i get beta invite or it releases

but HYPE!!!

Great script, and you do one hell of a good job presenting it.
---
Wow, so inspiring!   
---
I'm not a big fan of politics, but I agree with what all of you says.  
---
 Cheers!
---
2nd time I've seen a clip of this bug, it's pretty critical they get that fixed before launch.
---
I actually really like the BC version of group finder. It doesn't auto fill or transport you to dungeon. It was basically just like a message board that allowed you to see what other people are looking for your dungeon / elite quest and what roles they can do. I always just pretended it was like a message board that people can look at instead of spamming chat....which you can also still do.
---
I'm pretty sure boar livers, zhevra hooves, and knoll armbands and the like were *not* shared drops. If one group member is a loot hog, he needs to make sure he stays until everybody else has collected theirs as well before bailing and thinking everybody's done.
---
Some quest drops share. Group-specific quests I think, like dungeon quests and the like.
---
Res is distance based. If you die down in the bottom of that burning blade cave in Durotar the top/outside of the cave is simply too far from your corpse to res there. It's a straight directional line that ignores walls etc, but it's still simply too far in some case. You can only res up to X units away from your corpse but the distance between the innermost area of the cave and the top outside the cave might be Y distance, aka too far.
---
paladin leveling is pretty boring, but incredibly safe.
---
all the paladin specs just seal -&gt; judgement -&gt; seal and auto-attack with Consecration thrown in... and that's it.

This is either sub 60 beta (assuming sub 60 since it has only been live for a few days) or on a NON BLIZZ SERVER.

Either way your data is INTRINSICALLY inaccurate (whereas my memory is only POSSIBLY inaccurate).

‚ÄúClassic uses a different patch...‚Äù
---
I played 1.12 too, and MS was still being used by a lot of off tanks though many switched to prot because of the SS threat buff.
---
I have no memory wahtsoever of any sort of fury spec off tanks, though fury warriors were often asked to tank in a pinch, arms was still the preferred spec for off tanks among the two.
---
‚Äú... blah blah blah Naxx‚Äù this means there‚Äôs like a 99% chance you are referring to pserver  experience since very VERY few vanilla players actually got to even see naxx.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very easy to keep flurry up...‚Äù
---
This is not accurate at all.  Maybe in t2.5 (which iirc is actually itemized better for dps warz) you can get over 10% crit and still not be too squishy, but t 1-2-3 have no crit and very little agi.
---
If I missed any points let me just summarize:

I trust my 15 year old memory of the legitimate game more then I trust your current understanding of how things work on the pservers.

Is it though? Do you really learn vital things from doing easy dungeons and taking in the "the experience" running around leveling?  
---
When you're 60 you start mastering your class, everything before is just a tutorial, which you can pass by being bad.
---
The older generation of gaming is the one pushing for more demanding experiences.... pretty sure you have your story incorrect. 
---
Truth is you can look at games like farmville as early examples of micro transactions and the model they built. Corporations are going to go where the money is, don‚Äôt be naive and think that micro transactions aren‚Äôt designed specifically to give you satisfaction.

Streamable is blocked by my provider for some reason, lol.

Absolutely! Can't play the beta, so may as well nolife the forums for new blues for my friendos at work :D

The players on retail are way more hardcore then what the classic scene will be. Almost everyone who plays raids now it's not like how WoW use to be at all.
---
Are you rolling dice to narrow them down ?
---
How you liking front-end dev? Was considering a similar career shift.

Yeah I'm pretty sure that dude just read it wrong/didn't read further than the title, but instead of admitting he made a mistake he instead dug his feet in and went into full asshole mode.

Why are guild banks a harmless addition to the game but not barber shops?
---
I am right there with you. I thought he was a reliable source, watched a lot of his guides and explanations. Over the past few days revelations I am beginning to see that I know more about Vanilla than he does. Just from my private server play time. He is an absolute fraud making mistakes that wouldn't be made if you played in Classic or even TBC( When I got more into it, only messed around in Classic as a kid ).
---
well I dont have access to retail beta but from what I can tell from private servers the Y and X distance fell really off and Im sure they got which quest are shared and which are not wrong I just wish someone would be able to confirm that those things are right from its original values.
---
Darker vanilla nights? The game is in the current engine. Night is gonna be a skybox and that's it.

If wall jumping was a core gameplay element the mountains in the game would look like a set of stairs or have incline implying your character could walk up it. Again I'd like to point out that getting into Winterspring requires you to go through a cave where you either get unfriendly with furbolgs or you get a lock who has done it (with 2 other people) to get there. Not the convoluted way of jumping and sticking to a mountain with no ground underneath you, making sure your character clings on to the small hit box the mountains have to get over the cave and into Winterspring. There's no quest to go to any of these zones, you simply view them via FP's. If wall jumping was a means created by the devs themselves there would be more zones that would suggest you to do it and in other patches, there wouldn't be a giant invisible wall making you unable to go into those areas.

I disagree that it will destroy it. I also value long term server health benefits that layering + fewer servers promises.
---
Clips are allowed but full streams are not.

Why are you promoting an already popular streamer?

Me too on the nolifing. This games got my balls as blue as Bornaks posts.

I have ASD bound for arena targets, I wont have to do that in classic though :D

Yo, happen to have a link to the 1.12 client download then? Cuz every server that used to have clients to download it from has removed them so its not possible to even get on any...
---
This is like 12 years old, too.
---
Agreed. The auto group and port thing was really what screwed it up.
---
&gt; So you don't mind if a guy in your raid doesn't have resistance gear, just so long as he isn't a filthy, subhuman off spec?
---
You're right, I mind that way less, wanna know why? Because there's an opportunity cost associated with getting resistance gear or consumables, no such thing exists for playing the right spec, you're not losing anything, only gaining.
---
&gt; You are literally telling people how to play their class down to individual talent point placement. That's not "minor" in any way.
---
First of all, let me repeat myself for the 100th time, people can play the game however the hell they want, I just don't want o group with them.
---
Now that said, how is picking a different talent point a major difference?
---
&gt; Yes you have. Many, many, many times.
---
Quote, please
---
&gt; You define "being a detriment to others" as "not playing the game by the official rules I just made up." At this point dude, just straight up fuck you, you elitist scum.

Nope, I define being a detriment to others as negatively impacting them in ways that are measurable and objective.
---
&gt; u're the worst kind of player and you and your kind are the reason the MMORPG market is as fucked as it is.

Yes, people who care about others are the reason the MMO market is fucked, it's not the narcissists who go "mememememe" or players who go on rants insulting others because they have some kind of disagreement with them.

I got it as a gift for myself for a promotion :)

I feel you 100%! I‚Äôve been a horde main since vanilla and found that I made loads of friends in crossroads! I found that it was the perfect place to dual and chill with people and it seemed to get raided by alliance fairly often (which was always a fun pvp time). barrens chat was always a bit of a meme as well haha
---
It feels similar to how Final Fantasy has gone more and more toward action RPG since 10. I mostly remember literally spamming Swipe and Thrash nonstop on my druid while I auto walked through heroic dungeons only stopping briefly to kill a boss.
---
I would imagine hitbox and aggro radius are determined independently, but I'm not sure.
---
Chuck Norris jokes..didn't know I missed them till reminded by your post.

If I'm in a city or w/e and I need to find a shop running up to people and asking for directions feels more like what I'd do in real life. Also like real life sometimes that's how you make friends or learn cool things about a new place.

Some people might find that annoying and I respect their right to tell me to buzz off but many don't seem to mind and we strike up conversation. I always enjoy a chance to show someone the ropes, I think it's just fun being part of the world and doing what you can to remove the feeling of "I'm sitting on a chair playing a computer game".
---
&gt; Yeah, his guide mentioned going fury and macroing /sit to get critted to proc enrage. I‚Äôm just trying to make these next few months go by by imagining my future character haha
---
/sit will not work this has been confirmed. Thank god for that imo. It's a stupid mechanic.
---
To reiterate the general thesis of my argument:
---
Your experience with an inaccurate pserver does NOT allow you to make statements such as:  ‚Äúwe now understand...‚Äù
---
In fact, basing your argument on experience with an intrinsically different game directly refutes the accuracy of your statements.
---
this is why your argument is weak.  (Notice how I explain why something is such a way and not just make a baseless assumption )
---
I suggest you stick with pservers lest you make yourself look silly like the classicast people did earlier.
---
Stolen wow valor.
---
Just level as a dps spec, you'll be able to heal dungeons just fine until 60
---
I also want Elwynn Forest with 3k players in it.
---
Lol that makes things easier
---
Again, I know that the values may be a bit different on the classic wow servers. But my crit chance is gonna be the same in the same gear. They know exactly how that math works its no mystery. There is no way you have less than 10% crit man. NO WAY. You are pulling that number right out of your ass. Get Lionheart, Ony Neck, ZG Chest or Savage Chain (not on 1.12 patch version),  Don Julio's Ring/Blackstone/Tarnished Elven for TPS gear in early patches.
---
Now how about you address the arguments you continue to ignore. That MS was nerfed and BT and shield slam were buffed and that MS knocks off valuable debuffs and ruins raidwide DPS.
---
the new animation looks like he's sonic or someshit lol
---
Give Hunters Backstab! The you'll see scores of NElf Hunters Shadowmeld for hours in certain locations hoping a Horde will pass by.
---
"World first" shit on beta is completely retarded.  
---
Will be in Classic, as well.
---
Goddamn these streamers are whores.
---
If I do choose Horde (which I'm leaning on), crossroads will certainly be a consolation. I had a lot of fun there too.
---
That was beautiful. Upvote for you sir!
---
Hahahaha.   So true.  I remember my fully decked out T2 raiding rogue in the era of BWL winning any duel with similarly decked out warriors though, so I don't know how true that warrior beat rogues is though.
---
Get out of my brain!
---
Even private servers give you a *good idea* of what Vanilla is about. It‚Äôs not 1:1 or anything, but it‚Äôs representative of the game as a whole, to the point where you could be pretty good at Vanilla from playing Private Servers.
---
So I guess I‚Äôm still confused as to why he plays like he does, and complains about the things he does. Also he claims to champion the community of WoW, yet in-game, he can be a bit of a tool to groupmates and strangers.
---
Lol dude calm down it's ok.
---
this speaks to my soul
---
Yeah, WoW performance has been consistently good on linux in my experience. I would be pretty surprised if there were any considerable gains from using DXVK tbh.
---
I‚Äôm probably doing the same...
---
Or warrior
---
Or shaman
---
U already fucked up by choosing horde
---
&gt;You do not need a sub to receive a beta invite.
---
This is 100% verified incorrect.
---
the real problem is that when these phase they become invulnerable and frozen in time
---
I‚Äôm stealing this.
---
Main‚Äôd one in vanilla. Loved it!
---
Yes please! 2560x1440
---
If anyone casually leveling whines to blizzard wanting faster leveling or any other retail quality of life garbage I will be similarly pissed.
---
imagine coping so hard that you think all private server data is inaccurate and there was nothing to be copy+pasted
---
of course there are disparities but saying that there is no knowledge to be gained from a private server = you trying to cope, nothing else
---
So I've basically bought in to this sub and this hype in the past week or so. Not for the release date announcement; that was kind of a crazy coincidence. I see all the hate for streamers here and I've watched some and I do get some of the hate.
---
But this guy doesn't seem \*that\* bad. At least he wanted to used the cannon in that VC video I watched.
---
indeed.
---
yo, why don't tabards hang over the bottom of the robe?
---
Look forward to seeing you there brother!
---
The rebirth too

Orc warrior, or rogue or hunter. But then there is Tauren warrior or Druid... shaman is also a possibility.
---
He stated he would be pve server
---
There was a Blue post from Bornak a couple minutes ago, addressing it and saying it‚Äôs a bug, not intentional.
---
I was looking for a link. Thanks. Apr, 1 2005.
---
I know. I‚Äôm cursed.
---
Look bro they +15 INT and STAM is actually SUPER good for hunters in addition to the +6 STREN for Wingclip. Obvi hunter loot
---
Meh, wake me up when Bigwigs is ported :p
---
^This is nonsense. The fact that Ignite and Nightfall get pushed off by MS is not private server stuff, its right on WoW's own website.
---
Vanilla is too good. I subber for eso for 3 months to kill time last week, then I got classic beta. I dont think ill be playing much eso.
---
I look at it as the difference between simple and easy. Classic wow was very simple in most combats. But relative player powers were extremely low and you had to work within your very limited toolkit. A tank oneshot mechanic today is usually heavily telegraphed, on a predictable timer, and you just need to press your ‚Äúanti-oneshot‚Äù button. On the other hand broodlord lashslayer just rolled a die every few seconds, if it came up snake-eyes he hit you for 90% of your max hp, and there wasn‚Äôt a damn thing you could do about it.
---
Any form of sharding sounds awful to me but, I don't think it's going anywhere. To me Layering is just putting "lipstick on a pig" to quote Obama.
---
No but that‚Äôs a fantastic idea!
---
Really? I am pretty sure he wants to play on a PvP server.
---
I'll try to find the clip
---
Yea I agree. I watched his videos to learn more about classes
---
Except for collector edition pets from vanilla.
---
oct 2005 no beta, just subbed today. anyone know what time they go out?
---
Yeah but most of them are claiming to be veterans of vanilla, and it's likely false.
---
Got to 59 same day my family went on a 3 week vacation, pretty rough break. When we came home, I sat for 7 straight hours into the night, grinding mobs in Silithus. Dinged 60, hearthed and passed out. Was awesome.
---
If you could let me know when you get an answer I'd appreciate it!
---
Yeah that's what I said lol.
---
Did you get an email or did it just pop up in the launcher?
---
You‚Äôre dead to me
---
PvP in the beta doesnt give honor, so its Phase 1
---
I'd trust classic beta over pservers since it's literally using the original 1.12 database. Pservers had to do a bit of guesswork in some areas due to missing information that was only available internally to Blizz.
---
I suspect by the time beta ends and the game launches we'll know which quests share drops.
---
think its better to go mining and blacksmithing or just focus on money making skills?
---
&gt; are we talking about the same game? because the last time i played retail, almost every character had a skill to avoid fall damage, and tons of toys like gliders, feathers and so on to avoid fall damage too
---
Everyone can use gliders, yeah. But there are plenty of classes that have no built in ability to avoid fall damage. 
---
In a raid setting I think almost every class can deal with it except for shamans (maybe dks too?). As a mage I'm used to having to slowfall the shamans if they call out for it (like our not so brilliant ele shammy getting knocked up by the traps on jadefire).
---
Yeah I had some issues with this today. There was a dude CLEARLY BOTTING in Barrens and I was following him around tagging his mobs while it killed shit for me, and it got layered into a different realm.
---
I was kiting a paladin six levels above me on my hunter and he (or I) got layered into a different world and the fight just ended. 
---
I've had myself or my PET get layered where I have to call it back after 8-10 seconds.
---
I was getting ganked by a rogue when the Thouand Needle elevator took me to the top of Barrens and one of us got layered away. 
---
The only place I've seen safe from layering is dungeons. It does have its benefits. I cleared an area of mobs and layered into a zone with all new fresh mobs, so that's nice.
---
And Stitches.
---
This vid doesn't look classic. UI is off for sure, is he using addons?
---
Fuuuuck that.
---
Money is more valuable than time.
---
That might be just me though. I'm like that in every game. I don't know if I've ever bought a single item in Final Fantasy.
---
I'll meet u in stv smelly creature
---
I would bet that soda is going pvp idk about asmond
---
I Just botting Farming gold to pay all my bnet Accounts ,:D
---
I was really enjoying Albion, but then the beta started and now I'm like "meh" in regards to pretty much everything :/
---
You‚Äôre 100% right. it‚Äôs misleading. Paying 15 bux AFTER secured invitation in order to play vs paying for the chance to enter the lucky draw and not be chosen are TWO DIFFERENT things. 
---
It‚Äôs super shady IMHO
---
If blizzard made it clear that one could be invited WITHOUT a sub then many people would not have put 15 bux forward. It‚Äôs not even the dollar amount ($15 bux is more or less pretty trivial) it‚Äôs the weird trickery and obtuse phrasing that doesn‚Äôt sit so neat with me.
---
I‚Äôve narrowed it down to orc or undead. Just not a fan of Tauren running animation.
---
Ah fuck that's a typo.
---
2005.
---
Get fucked.
---
This is a big yikes from an outside observer.
---
Who cares? This is not an intense moment. He'll just mount up and fly back-... oh, wait.
---
This isn‚Äôt phasing or layering. 
---
This is what happens when are you within aggro range when mobs respawns. Happens all the time. 
---
You didn‚Äôt invite anyone or get invited when this happened. Which is when layering occurs.
---
Can confirm this as well on the pserv we're probably all playing as of 2 days ago
---
Sharding isn't suppose to happen to you while your in combat even on retail. You're honestly delusional if you think this is how they intend it to work. It's clearly a bug and is already posted as a known issue they're fixing on the forums.
---
That was just... No words. I have no words.
---
::resubs in order to march all Alliance characters into the ocean::
---
It'll have a huge impact. So I'm hoping they say what server they'll be on so the rest of us know to avoid it. I'm going to be on a RP server so it likely won't affect me though but Asmon I think has organized stuff on Moon Guard in the past.
---
This need to happen! RPPVP is a must.
---
It‚Äôs a date, one with blades or magic or totems but a date nonetheless.
---
While you're correct. It's still illegal. It's also kind of in poor taste to advertise competition on the official products medium.
---
You are absolutly right! I posted on the forum the same thing! It is semi wrong from what people told me. What I mean by that is that it is as intented on a pve server (neutral is shown as white). HOWEVER, on a pvp server, it should be like you said: friendly as green, red as hostile, and neutral/contested as yellow. 
---
From watching streamer that plays on the beta pvp server, the zone text is like you said, wrong. Elwyn forest, Loch modan and a few other zones are right now in the beta on a pvp server white( not coloured). They should be green for an alliance player.
---
 I hope it will get fix when it is release and that pvp server will have the right zone text color (YELLOW as neutral, RED as hostile and GREEN as friendly).
---
They do.  It requires a light feather (which this comic, despite not showing mages, reminded me I'll be farming in a few months),
---
Thanks man! I didnt have a script tbh lol. Should probly be more organized going forward.
---
Okay that's fair enough. I did just assume he was inexperienced. Put it down to him being too enthusiastic maybe! I am lucky that all the wipes I have caused over the years aren't on anyone's stream.
---
true, also a list with redditors so i could avoid them like the plague
---
Whats best is a preference but I normally go Skinning and enchanting while leveling. Skinning is just straight free money with zero extra effort. Also I may be off on the exact level but for enchanting you can disenchant everything in the game with like level 35 enchanting. So again money money. Enchanting mats are also free to post on the AH. So you don't lose a cut if they don't sell at first.
---
Personally I would avoid any job that costs money like a plague until you have a mount. Would never recommend leveling a job like blacksmithing.
---
No. They are both only POSSIBLY inaccurate. And really, my crit chance is definitely not inaccurate. How crit chance is calculated is publically available.
---
The link you went to for purchase history only starts when you created a battle.net account which wasn't required during vanilla launch. Use the link above for subscription time. I had the same problem as you.
---
I mean I still fall to my death in retail
---
Hi, /u/Ultima1221
---
Yup. I got my invite today.
---
Well, on a shortened schedule your progression options were really huge compared to today. It was not uncommon to see bad players on a bis character just because sharing is caring. The increased raid sizes and the ease of dungeoneering meant it was ok for most friendly groups to carry your sorry ass. Let's not forget that money talks and that you could achieve most things by simply grinding gold and then buying it.
---
As a casual you didn't have to do much really. Say as a warlock you would farm some shards for an hour and your AQ clearing guild would carry you trough a BWL run. See that there? That was a core raider that didn't have to farm those shards and a casual that didn't have to progress.
---
For players more interested in sinking time it was also rather simpler. Gold was the sole glue that did bind everyone together. If geared and organised, carrying was trivial. Selling high level recipes and mats only you had would net solid gold. And most of these venues had great return on time invested. Do GDKP run with your guild, all of a sudden everyone is few 100 gold richer. Say you help out your newbie friends in MC and an ingot drops from Magmadar? and your guild just got rich enough to craft a few bis items.
---
I do remember being BiS on my shaman with only 30 days played, with offspec sets, a solid bank account, massive amounts of consumables and knowing I could be BiS whatever happened in 2 months just by raiding twice a week and spending the assets I already amassed. I also remember much more clearly my mid legion character that was always 10ish ilvls from BIS, with upgrades everywhere I looked. His bank account always on the brink of bankruptcy as all the thing I had to do+the fact gold means dirt in its inflated state, meant I would never farm gold.
---
This is beta after all....the phase that you work bugs out?
---
Classic dungeons felt much more punishing. There were streamers in WC who wiped so much their gear was broken before they got to the last boss, then they reported the boss as bugged for doing too much damage. I know you can run mythics and get a similar feeling of difficulty, but it doesn't really seem to last. Even in AQ/BWL my druid can't just run through multiple packs of mobs and tank 15+ things, but in Legion that was casual level. Not having a dungeon finder forces you to get to know tanks and healers better, which I admit can be pretty inconvenient for dps players. I'll get messages in discord from guild mates or people I've met asking if I want to tank some dungeon or 20man randomly. I can appreciate doing a dungeon fast, but again I just hate the speed running idea. I hate being on someone else's timer, it makes it feel more like a fast paced action RPG rather than an MMO. I feel like it also attracts short tempered people more often. I've had plenty of people leave after a bad start of a M+ key leaving the group with no chance of completing because they just want to get into another group.
---
Would send help, except I need it myself.
---
Their role in the raid is to stay on the turtle starting zone and res when needed.
---
The blink mechanic was such a game changer that I still remember when I learned it and first used it.
---
This also makes me think...I wonder if the terrain will bug out blink all the time like it used to.
---
I do agree it would be better if a person couldn't switch. Guilds will stay on the same layer, and they should allow friends to spawn on the same layer and turn off the ability to jump layers.
---
What's the jank?
---
Also since you're a pet class how is pathing?
---
I'll be sure to throw your opinion in the trash where it belongs., thanks.
---
I feel the same. I still play Overwatch cause it's not a big time commitment and my GF loves it too. Besides that I've just been playing Divinity Original Sin 2. Found out about it a couple of weeks ago and it has not disappointed. Good game until classic for me.
---
Clearly these are not the only cases layering is applied as seen by all the clips from the beta of mobs disappearing/reappearing. If that gets fixed I'm back on the layering train though
---
My servers first level 60 was a chinese farmer.  I got to know him and he let me put him on follow while he killed griffons in azshara (iirc) to hit 60 that night when I went to bed.  Cool guy, after he hit his gold quota he would come to Tarren Mill and pvp with me!
---
yes, welcome to me for the last 4 or so months lol
---
&gt;unnecessary hype
---
We literally *need* all of the hype we can get if we want this to be successful. We won't survive long if we can't bring in new players.
---
OSRS did it 100% correctly, and it seems that Blizz is, thankfully, taking notes
---
I knew of titan panel and a few other addons, but I also never heard of Cosmo either, it's pretty standard to forget things over the course of 15 years or never experienced it; but I also started like a month or two before TBC.
---
I was under the impression they were going to remove mouseover as well....
---
Here's the thing though, it isnt about just changing the specs. They would have to change the whole class and even if they just changed something in the spec it could change what you build for the other specs. 
---
It's also about the items, there isnt any items designed for moonkin and spriests who uses a ton of mana, so they'd have to change items which could impact all the other classes. 
---
Changing 1 thing could fuck a lot of things in the game
---
Please keep it up, more posts for me to report.
---
RIP my lvl 60 undead mage. Nost was a blast and he did not die in vain :))))))
---
Thankfully, long live wpvp!
---
I ask what they think of OSRS and how it's more popular than RS3 and have never gotten a reasonable response from them or they never reply. Pretty telling.
---
Hardware is also on the checklist. If you got a weird setup you're more likely to be chosen.
---
Opposite for me. I played a Paladin from launch through Legion. I started playing a Tauren Druid on pservers, and felt more welcome and had more social interaction than I EVER did playing an alliance character.  More communication through chat channels/bg‚Äôs, and less overall toxicity and negativity.
---
I agree, no reason NOT to have an RP-PVP server. Do it Blizz!!
---
i'm levelling my first character to 60 ASAP, THEN i'm going to have 2 alts that i level and take my time with.
---
and there is not a goddam thing you can do to stop me (unless you are alliance rogue waiting for me in STV.... pls dont)
---
Blight's blope
---
Going by retail, I have very low confidence in Blizzard recognizing damage or HP values being completely off in a reasonable time frame. You could twoshot mobs in a lot of leveling zones for years and they didn't care.
---
i started playing in i think 05 but mine doesn't go back past 12. I think its because of the way i merged my old account into my new bnet?
---
I'm fairly sure allakhazam was doing wow stuff too
---
But why does everyone want the beta invite?? You can't take it with you to launch.
---
I feel like M+ vibes better with people who are into speed running and fast paced action RPGs. It just isn't my style really. I know it's better for retail though because people don't really have an hour or more to dedicate to running a dungeon because most of us aren't 14 and failing HS because were too addicted to purples to do our HW.
---
I hate to break it to you man but there was a CM post that said if you are subbing today the future waves wouldn't include you.
---
https://i.imgur.com/PXfTWGY.jpg
---
I'm not saying there isn't, what I'm saying is that being a private server players has no more relevance than veterans playing modern wow (if anything veterans playing modern wow have more cred than pserver players who have only played pserver)
---
RIP my lvl 60 orc rogue, it was an honor
---
Aww, did me exposing your hypocrisy make you so mad you felt the need to call the scary mods?
---
I love how you're the person who insults people as your way of arguing and then when that doesn't work you just decide to report them instead... yet you so firmly believe *I* am the reason MMOs are going down hill.
---
Exactly! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been trying to tell my resto pally friend!
---
Been watching some streams and the impression I have is that all the class revamps that Blizzard did really affected on how easier some dungeons have become.
---
Bosses are dieing so fast that they don't feel like a boss anymore and just another trash mob. Parties have no difficulties in handling 4, or even 5 mobs even when under-levelled.
---
It could be that the mob "Scaling" is a bit off when fighting mobs +3 levels above, or that the player damage/healing capability is so high that it mitigates the level difference. 
---
I watched a stockades run and the ogre boss that was 5 levels above the players, died without much effort in under a minute, even with 2 3 adds up. 
---
I'm pretty sure it used to be much harder than this where I had to be really careful to not over-pull to avoid possible wipes (3+ mobs), and when I over-pulled, the damage pressure from mobs was much higher that I had to keep my mitigation up as much as possible and the healer was almost oom most of the times. In the stockades run I saw, the healer barely lost any mana with 4-5 mobs up fighting the tank, and I don't think they stopped once to drink.
---
Overall it feels like vanilla, the numbers feels like vanilla, but cleary not everything is as difficult as it used to be, either because of possible bugs that need fixing or because the talent revamps made it easier, but this was something that most people probably have realised by now, that we will never have the same difficulty as when the game was released on 1.0.
---
Also in case someone says "it's just a pserver thing", I never leveled to 60 on pservers.
---
Classic WoW atm feels right, almost as I remember it, but it appears to be easier than back then.
---
[Blue Post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/sharding-after-latest-server-restart/175660/88) says it's not a known issue, they are looking into it
---
Here you go.

Asmongold is hit and miss for me with his content. I enjoyed every minute of that Deadmines run. It was kind of nice seeing him actually enjoy the game he was playing, instead of kind of tolerating it.
---
There were a lot of butt clench moments where I was sure they were gonna wipe.
---
Shamans has a lot of good spells at 30, windfury weapon, frost shock, purge, ghost wolf and some totems. The best weps (except ww axe for warr) would probably come from gnomeregan, so that would be crowd pummeler and thurmaplogg whatever the fuck its called. 
---
fiery weapon is only dropped from a 52 rare elite in brd. So unless youre able to go in and farm it as a raid, you wont get a chance of even get the recipe, and you need 265 to learn it.
---
Achievments, pet battling, a lot of stuff to do man...
---
Don't worry I've got it planned out :D
---
you should definitely have back pedal enabled somewhere on your keyboard. There are lots of times where you use it to drop down to a small ledge liek you see here since your movement speed backwards is slower than forward you dont get propelled as much. Its necessary imo.
---
We're in the same boat haha
---
I used to love Asmon but i found myself sticking with watching Soda during the beta so far. Every time i tuned in to Asmons stream he was using every little mundane thing he was doing to beg for twitch primes.
---
Listening to classic soundtrack on spotify, dreaming of days gone and better times, waiting to go back and start again.
---
Now if I can talk my 2 old friends into coming with me, life's good.
---
Asmongold could pick his nose for 12 hours straight and still get 100k viewers so I don't think that means much.
---
oh yeah, I just said "issues". Im not going overboard and saying they're not viable
---
This isn't the 1.12 client.
---
You are going to want something with at least a graphics card, not Intel Graphics.
---
Not a core2duo either.
---
Treat Classic WoW like BFA in the starting zones, you will get very similar performances.
---
Every time I log into WoW and Classic is brought up people complain.
---
Raiding, dungeons, large scale dungeons (upper BlackRock spire is 15 man) pvp grind, crafting, farming.
---
A lot of the same stuff that you're doing now in bfa without all the world quests and invasions
---
I play eso about 3x a week. But yeah, been waiting for classic.
---
You give them an inch, they will want/take a mile. You cant give them something from retail, because they will just demand more. In the end classic could turn into the shit show that is called retail wow
---
If you are planning to rush to 60 nothing stops you from lvling an alt, with even more comfort by having gold behind for no worries lvl40 mount, boosting profs, buying gear-quest items etc
---
Wands and grouping will be your friend if you are going full healing spec.
---
Just log into the game and talk about classic, people will be shit talking pretty soon.
---
Please point out the hypocrisy.
---
Don't pretend like this was a good faith argument on your part at any point.  You're some scumbag troll, don't act like you're on the high road.
---
This brings back memories switching specs to arms for pvp, fury for farming, prot for raiding. At least guildies would sometimes cover my respec costs
---
//before you read my little rant. sorry I'm tired and will sleep now. Please ignores any misspellings. I will correct them tomorrow. Now Im to tired//
---
Same for me, kinda. After the first big private server got shot down by blizzard and made some fuss I became aware of pservers. I could only remember them being half assed and mostly without any mechanics and whatsoever. But I read that the server was like the real deal and thousands of people used to play there before they got closed.
---
So I downloaded a 1.12 client and googled up some pservers which did see OK and had increased leveling speed. I didn't want to invest lots of time nor dud i plan for long. Maybe get to 60 and do some pugs. My job would not let me raid anyway as I had working hours Monday-Thursday from 7:00-20:00.
---
Well I reached 60 on my paladin and started hitting dungeons and farmed my healing gear. That's when I noticed that I was in very bug trouble, I either quit now or I'll be raiding again. U gas always kept a eye on the guild recruitment spam. There was one guild I in theory I could raid with.
---
And down the rabbit hole I went. And I went deep. What started me out as a little nostalgia trip took me to class leader after a month and half a year later being a officer raiding naxx. 
---
I spend 2 years with them raiding and even now a year after I stopped playing we still have contact. Hopefully we can play on retail together again.
---
For me I never regretted choosing to raid again, even if it was tough every raid to make it in time. Usually my shift ended when raids started and I was lucky when I didn't had to go to a hotel first. Still meant most of the time not being able to shower or properly eat after 13 hours of work until raid was done at 12. But still was worth it.
---
There has to be a big community push for it like what the osrs community did
---
Guys I don't think this is real.
---
I sure hope not
---
&gt; from WOTLK forward
---
More like BC forward. Vanilla is the only expansion we didn‚Äôt all night powerlevel to get a leg up on raid completion, mostly because no one knew anything and it was the longest time to level in the history of the game. Even as early as day 1 of BC we rushed hard.
---
It was playable on us servers before, but with everyone being a bit better now it will be much worse, similar to playing on retail with 200ms
---
You could see and engage mobs/players across zones in vanilla. They would not disappear. The only time you would see a mob vanish is from distance and going back the mob would reappear.
---
SM ruin is fine for casual pvp.
---
its fine for world pvp, WSG and AV, it's kinda bad for AB though guarding a flag without soul-link is rough.
---
Tigole-Sama!
---
I see that embody. You sir, are a man of good taste.
---
Thanks, Sherman.
---
That's a terrible analogy. I enjoy cooking and have worked in a few bars / restaurants as a cook, but I will still get nasty on some sloppy MickyDees.
---
Name claims for both sides.
---
 Stormwind is kind of an option, I played Horde, The only way we would usually find a group for Gnomer or Dead Mines would be to form in ORg and walk there.
---
You are literally trying to justify that you are somehow entitled to have influence over how someone else should spec.  That‚Äôs pretty ducking toxic. 
---
You make shit arguments trying to justify this, such as groundless statements like ‚ÄúI am presenting a realistic perspective.‚Äù Without any support as to why your perspective is ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù at all.
---
I am being toxic towards you, because your attitude is one of the MOST toxic displays o have ever see  and it is detrimental to the community:
---
1 because your information and observations are based on pservers instead of vanilla and therefore inaccurate, 2 the fact that you are pretentious enough to suggest people specking the way they want is somehow your call is obnoxious.
---
Your audacity in not understanding how much of a dick statement you made concerning other people‚Äôs spec affecting you leads me to believe that you are a bad person and will die alone.
---
Then enjoy having plenty of dead servers and super long queue timers at launch.
---
We are of differing opinions then because I never witnessed this. Zones and borders never caused this to happen.
---
As visionary as a forest-stump.
---
How about you telling me how to play the game, yet insulting me because you (for made up reasons might I add) believe I'm telling people how to play the game.
---
Or how about you call me an "elitist gatekeeper" because I have the audacity to assert that there's certain people I don't wish to play with, meanwhile you yourself admit there's certain people you wont play with.
---
It's always 10 minutes unless you're below level 10.
---
Blizzard should be able to do better than private servers.
---
A well played rogue wins every matchup, given they have all their cooldowns and start from stealth, and get the first hit in.  *even verses other rogues*.  It's who strikes first from stealth.
---
Jesus this is a terrible website
---
Congratulations on your bachelors!! I hope you are very proud of yourself :).
---
God yes. I found myself just clicking around in the Dota client trying to come up with some fun shit to do but my mind couldn't leave the thoughts of Classic. Ended up just closing the client and began watching a beta stream.
---
Is the twitch playback garbage for anyone else?
---
Is this the most the WoW sub has ever seen for viewers on Twitch?
---
I knew I'd see this when I clicked the thread, I still laughed.
---
I'm pretty sure that doesn't mean all the future waves.
---
I'm hoping so!
---
That's why I really loved the BC version of LFG. It was basically just a message board where you can put in an application for up to 3 dungeons or elite quests. People can see others who have signed up and can just whisper each other directly, but it never autofilled (I think there was an option to just auto accept anyone) nor did it teleport you to dungeons. Summoning Stones did work in BC though.
---
wut? He's asking what *Classic* endgame will be like.
---
" Starting in Patch 1.9, schools of fish or floating debris appear at set locations along coastlines and rivers. "

Morning mate. I‚Äôm from Western Australia and got in the beta yesterday with a 2004 account with an active sub I reignited a week ago. My ping on the beta server in the US is a nostalgic 450ms haha. 
---
However, I‚Äôd be absolutely astounded if they didn‚Äôt have Aus servers for classic as we‚Äôve got ones for retail in Sydney. 
---
A little sad that Americans and Aus won‚Äôt be playing  together since layering restricts server hoping between US and Aus and is basically acting as a server only phasing that‚Äôs a bit more static.
---
Thanks! I'm glad I didn't when I was younger though, I probably would have dropped out lol.
---
skinning can be good especially in the early economy. I paid for my first mount picking gromsblood in desolace, but obviously that won't be a thing this time around as there's no big raider pop to drive prices up.
---
Yes, it is running on the 7.3.5 - 8.0.1 client (not sure specifically which one)
---
Testers would better check another spot to the left to the Chillwind camp (same phasing bug also occured in there constantly without any apparent zone change on pservers).
---
If it confirms then they are literally importing LH core lmao
---
That's how I was back then. Can't tell exactly when the screen was taken. I renamed the file at some point and I converted the .tga much later in early 06.
---
Gofigure, I used to watch soda (years ago) but more recently (couple months) asmond.
---
I level all my healers in healing spec, its slow but I enjoy doing it that way
---
I‚Äôve just been watching TV, so bored. 
---
Path of Exile kept me busy for a few days, but now it‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I‚Äôve played a game.
---
Yeah I'm waiting to see what this looks like now üòÇ
---
monkaS
---
Good advice for those who want to get behind of the pack just to get massacred later on
---
Warlocks are mushrooms because everyone beats mushrooms.
---
It would never happen, but if N0rthdale and L1ght's Hope were 2 available servers that would be pretty sick
---
repost?
---
Called beta for a reason. The base game had plenty of problems back then to. Phasing is a modern solution to other problems that is causing new problems.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
I wouldn't call them absolute shit, and the roguecraft videos kind of touched on that. If you get lucky with crits in like Drakedog vids, you would absolutely blow people up no problem. 
---
Even Happimini touched on this in (one of my favorite videos) the Nerf Sap 8 video, that he was PvPing with a Warlock for a while. [Happiminti Nerf Sap 8 where he talks about playing a lock](https://youtu.be/YvQoYMq8_Ng?t=57). 
---
so Im kinda bummed people are downvoting me.  I played pally as a main vanilla but also a good amount of warlock for PvP and mushroom summed up my experience 100%. I played like a SM/Ruin build and gbless america when you got nightfall procs you felt like a god. but fuck me if I got a warrior or rogue on me. 
---
total mushroom, squishy but you eat the wrong one and you keel over dead
---
You cannot name a horde character the same name as an already existing Alliance character and vis versa. If you have an Alliance character with a name you want for your Horde character then you will have to delete the Alliance character and create a Horde character with that name before someone takes the name. 
---
As for dungeoning in Horde zones as Alliance, it goes just like it would for Horde. It just takes longer to get there, there at less people trying to do them, and there are less quests involved. This last point basically means they aren‚Äôt really worth doing as an Alliance player. There are Alliance equivalents that will be more worth your time, but feel free to do those dungeons as they are cool and it can be fun to have gear that other Alliance players maybe don‚Äôt have.
---
It is realistic because these patches happened. It is realistic because MS does push off ignite. These are arguments that are not based off private servers in any way. 
---
This isnt about how your spec affects me. This is about how your spec affects 39 of your team members in the raid.
---
I see what you mean, the more eagle eye viewer can clearly see overwatch is missing from the side bar.
---
Not untill Naxx. Priests base healing is just too high for any other healer to even come close. Paladins have better buffs and utility but in terms of raw healing it's priest. I was going to mention that palas catch up to priests as you enter Naxx but OP was asking for priest vs druid so I didn't see the point.
---
As already stated, it's just a custom channel. The problem back in the day was getting everyone to use a custom global channel that was accessible from outside a city. Even if you got a large group of players to use a channel, there was a constant influx of new players and a constant trickle of retiring players, so using Trade and /who were the most reliable/straightforward ways to find a group.
---
It actually has use as a character with a shield. Back pedal allows you to face your target and continue blocking while moving backwards. That‚Äôs the only thing I used it for. But fuck tanking lol
---
&gt; How about you telling me how to play the game, yet insulting me because you (for made up reasons might I add) believe I'm telling people how to play the game.
---
For the absolute last time; you can play the game however you want, but you can't deny that you're an elitist gatekeeper.  Requiring people to spend talent points on their characters on your whims, and not theirs, is literally telling people how to play the game.
---
&gt; Or how about you call me an "elitist gatekeeper" because I have the audacity to assert that there's certain people I don't wish to play with, meanwhile you yourself admit there's certain people you wont play with.
---
They are not direct comparisons.  My requirements: meet the common minimum.  Your requirements: meet the common minimum and give me control of your decision making.  
---
If you reply to this with anything even remotely trollish, even far less trollish than you have been, I am putting the condition on you that you are in fact admitting to targeted harassment and should be banned.  Capice?
---
That rogue in suicide watch
---
I think it will be be bigger than Blizzard thinks it will by a mile. Not overtaking retail, but still massive.
---
Now, if after a couple years they begin releasing new content in the spirit of vanilla, it could actually have a shot at beating out retail.
---
Right, what you‚Äôre describing is a naieve numeric implementation. 
---
    if (pop &gt; 3000) new_layer()
---
However, things generally don‚Äôt work like this in reality. Even in non game server balancing, any type of server balancing would suffer in this model.   
---
Generally, you‚Äôd look at the rate of change, rather than the current number. So let‚Äôs say server is at 200 people and a new ~100 people log in every 10 minutes, and you want server load below 1000 (for simplicity. With 200 people on the server, you know in 80 minutes you‚Äôll hit your limit so after 40 minutes, you start distributing batches of logins above the median login rate across more than one layer. 
---
This is also a pretty ghetto implementation, but that‚Äôs the idea, no one uses linear thresholds and hard limits in practice.
---
Hi, /u/Ownejj

# trash
---
Both a good and bad thing I guess lol, can't play it on a GeForce 6800 with with 1GB RAM anymore :(
---
The belief is backpedaling is a noob move and is a bad habit, so most people unbind it because we can simply turn with our mouse and strafe the same way someone would backpedal but without the reduced movement speed.
---
Just chug Noggenfogger elixirs till you get featherfall.
---
Dude same, since the beta came out I'm watching this and then going back to retail I feel like shit. Nothing feels worth doing anymore. I wasn't enjoying the game before, but now it's even worse cause I have a clear example of what I'm waiting for :')
---
I'm guilty of being less social when I did Legion too, not like your example. I'd mostly just queue for random heroics on my main or alts specifically for that additional bag you get from tanking or healing when queues are long. I'd only do dungeons for that because it was a really easy way to make gold. It just felt like the pace of the game got so much faster you were rewarded for just rushing through things leaving immediately and insta queuing for something else.
---
Imagine being so fucking pissed on pserver players that you switch from discussing streamers (wow streams overall are boring as hell unless they are doing content that you can learn tricks from Imo) to discussing pservers. Are you so salty and jealous that players from pservers will be better than you on launch because they played on there and know what they are doing?
---
Looks amazing but would love to see the starting area for night elfs with the big tree, or any thing night elf related Haha
---
If blizzard put this much attention to detail into WoD, classic might not exist.
---
I‚Äôm going Horde to for Friends/Family. 
---
Alliance for Nostalgia.
---
Here to show my support, too!
---
is [this](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Resurrection_Sickness) wrong then?
---
Wait. So you're seriously saying that nobody should ever make any sort of political reference ever. Even as a joke. Genuinely. Are you genuinely that fucking stupid?
---
To be fair watching anyone pick their nose after even say 3 hours would draw a fairly high viewer count.
---
How many picks per minute (ppm) does the host have to keep up with? How deep does each pick have to be to count as a full pick? What about the "digging for gold" type of picks, can that count as two picks? It can't go by booger procurement, as your body can't produce an adequate supply in that timeframe that would fulfill the ppm quota.
---
I mean at some point the soft skin of your inner nose would become severely inflamed, and even your finger will start to hurt. And that's after I assume 30 mins of 10 ppm if not sooner. 
---
I guess I would say they could dip their finger in some Vaseline on the downstroke, but I don't think that would be enough of an advantage to keep from serious damage after a few hours. 
---
Probably start tuning in around hour five, that'll be make or break time. If they can make it to hour 12 they deserve a decent reward.
---
I'm pretty computer hardware illiterate, any good recommendations for cheap computers that would work then?
---
This is exactly how i feel, before beta release I was playing Bfa doing my dailies, raiding with the guild, and some m+. Now that the beta is out all I do is watch streams and feel sorry for myself sinve i dont have access
---
Fuck man welcome to the club. Manly hug?
---
g-guys its just broken, the REAL layering will be really good, blizzard said so
---
Cheap is subjective, I would need a price range.
---
Why should the other 39 raiders give a shit about YOUR dps?
---
Your argument is premised on the fact that your ability to maximize dps is somehow more important then your fellow raiders ability to spec how they please?
---
Why is this at all preferable?  (You will likely argue that it is somehow more efficient to min max in this way in which case we arrive back at the various counter example offered in the post above)
---
Assuming that 39 other people should give a shit about your preference in doing damage is some pretty self centered, weak T, pserver, bullshit, and you deserve to get called out for espousing it.
---
I don't think it's ridiculous to think there is going to be a drop off in players after Classic launches. People who enjoy BFA more are going to go back, people are going to realize it's not for them.
---
Not everything is a personal attack on Classic, you don't have to get so defensive about it.
---
I am going to level to 40 as fast as possible to try and kill the rare spawn off the coast of Arathi Highlands. Drops an insane on use pvp trinket called the Tidal Charm that stuns the target for 3 seconds. I wanted it so bad back in Vanilla and would always try to camp the rare for it but never got it. One can assume many old vanilla players have different goals similar to these of things they may have not gotten in vanilla or experienced and they will probably zero in on it as fast as possible.
---
I‚Äôm probably in the minority here, but I‚Äôm happy with a late August release. Living in the Northeast US, I‚Äôm not wasting a single minute of my warm season in my home on the computer. I have 6 months of winter for that.
---
That's it boys. That's the one.
---
Its sad bc this could be an interesting conversation since I think you do remember vanilla well. But you are too toxic to have a normal argument. Out of curiosity , do you remember how much def you wore through Vanilla? Were you constantly striving to be def capped? Or were you balancing various stats?
---
I forgot about that.  Been a long time.  But it was funny when they missed.
---
Leveling as a mage in vanilla is going to be rough
---
I was in Winter spring too, grinding the ghosts (?) in the frozen lake.
---
There is absolute zero shared / common code between Classic WoW and MangOS core. The only chance a bug would exist in both places is by pure coincidence, and the likelihood is lower than winning 5 lottos.
---
Ok....L2make threads...sorry
---
Now we need Jame, or was it James? I used Joana's guide for my horse toons and Jame's Alliance guide for my alliance toons.
---
Basically what is the absolute bare minimum I can spend to get a computer that will run WoW effectively enough to not ruin the experience? I'd love to spend around $200, but I know thats asking for a lot lol.
---
Not my problem yo. Learn some skills that give higher pay. Like coding.
---
Probably can, given it's using downgraded assets and all. But then again, why would you? You gotta get some new computer parts, yo.
---
Some people just prefer actually exciting PvE gameplay other than waiting for five sunders and feeling useful because you pressed poly on a mob
---
Well in regard to the AQ guy being brought in for the BWL gear run, at that point your guild mostly had all the gear they needed and were gearing up people who still needed gear for that AQ run. Most guilds were running every raid to try and get as much gear as possible since raids dropped such few gear for the 40 people running them, which is why we had the systems we did back then. 
---
Raids were also so large and mechanics not being as difficult as now, (at least if I'm remembering a video correctly, can't swear if it was legit or Pserver) you could still finish a boss with 10/20 people dead (assuming they weren't tanks/heals). 
---
I really don't remember selling gear in Vanilla in raids though. 
---
As much as people swear legion was a good expansion, I'm not sure I want to agree because again, the randomness of the diablo legendaries that provided abilities forced you to do shit you didn't want to get the BIS ones that actually provided DPS rather than let you do something stupid like gain a shield when not getting hit (this was originally the worst and then everyone loved it towards the end, but no one seems to remember that).
---
I'm not disagreeing on any of your post. I do agree that money is somewhat harder to come by now (unless your a flipper, or know what is currently on the AH, hell most of the money I've made was always at the beginning of an expansion, or during legion when they had that stupid DE easy to make items for good gear) but that's because everyone does professions now, before you actually had to level them up. 
---
Part of the problem being, pots and food both required for M+ and raids. Sure pots last an hour, but flask are required for every fight and sometimes two of them (pre potting bs). Maybe my complaints come from being from a slightly bleeding edge guild and that's what bled me out. Herbs were a pain to gather and will be even more so in classic, food I cant remember in vanilla but I know bandages will be required as well.
---
I always use https://www.random.org/lists/ to do this then second guess the results and start over, rinse and repeatedly do it
---
Then you are either full of shit or not wearing tank gear, because there‚Äôs no way you are getting to 20% crit otherwise.
---
Ya. I don't get these people. "they are retail streamers"
---
Wtf do you expect them to do? Build a time machine and stream og vanilla wow? Majority of the "retail" streamers played vanilla wow.
---
That's where BoL comes in. It gives so much extra healing paladins with terrible gear can push out some respectable numbers anyway. 
---
I commented to somebody saying priests were the best healer but mentioned that priests are definitely better than druids.
---
No shit, it's just funny that he is doing as I said.
---
What is effectively? 
---
I persoanlly cant stand anything under 60FPS. 60+FPS would be effective for me.
---
If your Ok with 10 FPS, $200 might be doable, but if you want 30 consistent FPS or more your goona need to spend $400+
---
Generally my Tauren are Druid so I don‚Äôt ever see their animations...
---
I‚Äôve narrowed it down to horde and that‚Äôs about it.
---
Ud rogue or orc?
---
That is some big brain right there.
---
Ding ding ding. You hit the nail on the head. That being said I hope there is a strong enough showing to encourage blizzard to keep supporting classic
---
True, soda stream is so much chill and he's not forcing memes like asmon 24/7, also a better player overall.
---
DK
---
We should compare this one with the 15k from earlier and average the two of them
---
I can sorta understand the world first thing, but people seem to make it out to be the only thing that matters.
---
It's using the modern client, so ultrawide will most likely work. I played a vanilla private server and ultrawide worked just fine.
---
Mastery and Vers weren‚Äôt a thing I know. I am pretty sure the base stats were semi similar as they are now. Higher priority could get to the 20s. Nothing that i remember insanely high though (30s). I don‚Äôt play on a private server or anything so i may be mistaken from the long duration it‚Äôs been
---
I started playing in Wrath and even I knew that.
---
A cave-dweller, a hermit, a person who is deliberately old fashioned or ignorant. Also a smelly lizard creature in Dungeons and Dragons.
---
Oh I do, but its a nostalgic game, would be cool if it ran the same on same era computers
---
I understand it, and it's a poor solution. I'm baffled that you could possibly think this is a good decision after seeing this
---
Stationary Jump + W
---
I dont think it matters that much aslong as youre account was active in the past. A lot of people are currently unsubbed before 8.2 and just resubbed and got a beta invite.
---
I'm pretty sure the skinning thing is accurate for vanilla. I remember that happening to me back in the day.
---
20-25 hours per week, Rank 7-10 I would wager, could be wrong though.
---
Chance is good at the game. He's played in top tier private server guilds and has proven himself time again. But he's the outlier. Asmongold is a trash player. Classic will reveal this. Just watch. Generally being a full time streamer and playing wow at a high level don't mix due the required time investment and that holds especially true in vanilla.
---
Im one of the Atlas devs. Still no invite
---
You sound much more toxic than someone with a differing opinion. I would absolutely not want bigots like you in my community.
---
Hey man, the OCE community is alive and well for classic. Come join  [https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H](https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H)  (it's the Classic WoW Oceanic discord) if you have any doubts.  
---
I'd put money on the fact that there will be OCE servers for classic, the infrastructure already exists in Sydney so there is no reason not to.
---
then turn on the profanity filter. i agree racism and sexism should be a bannable offense but who draws the line its different for everyone. everyone feels differently towards a word. im bi but faggot does not bother me because i was never bullied with that word does that mean all gay people should feel like i do about the word? no of course not but it doesnt bother me so i wouldn't report it.
---
What are your thoughts on the Demon Hunter?
---
Knocking off ignite is you single handedly wiping every mage in the raid's dps at once. It is you saying you are more important than all of the mages. Knocking off Nightfall affects every single caster and whoever worked hard and sacrificed their dps to get the proc. 
---
All bc you are obsessed with having a pvp spec in raid. 
---
Vanilla is about being a team player above all else.
---
A lot of the fun in Classic comes from figuring out how to have fun. Sometimes you just have to use your imagination and make your own fun with friends in the open world. 
---
If you raid or PvP (or both) there is a lot that goes into being the best you can be at either side. Lots of gold farming, profession work, reputation grinds, obscure quest lines and items you can chase. A lot of these things seem like work to many people which makes it no fun for them. But embracing these activities and being imaginative while doing them is how I have fun. 
---
This game is also super immense with lots of hidden gems throughout. Exploration in various forms can be a great way to have fun playing World of Warcraft.
---
yeah I fucked up
---
Yes! because you played on pservers you cannot make any argument premised on your experience from pservers.
---
This is precisely my argument.
---
üò¢
---
Thanks, I tanked in retail. But with classic, I'll be tanking. So I've been trying to practice, but often find myself getting anxious or stressed because I always feel pressure on myself to do a perfect run and afraid to fuck up
---
Do you want to be a hobo and live in a mud tent?
---
If so go horde
---
I think some of it has to do with weapon skill and miss/dodge/parry rates.  I noticed I rarely if ever "miss" auto attacks.  Also weapon skill is leveling up A LOT faster than it should, by the time I'm in the 3rd or 4th level bubble I'm already maxed my weapon skill.  It used to take almost the entire level to do that, or at least felt like that.
---
Yeah his "bigdick attitude" character is simply that a character for entertainment. He doesnt break character alot on stream but when he does he seems like a cool dude.
---
I'm excited for you. You played at the worse time for the game, lmfao
---
&gt; Requiring people to spend talent points on their characters on your whims, and not theirs, is literally telling people how to play the game.
---
Okay, lets go with me not wanting to group with people who, for no reason other than to spite people, pressed button A instead of button B *is* telling people how to play.
---
That would also mean requiring people getting resist gear and consumables is telling them how to play... right?
---
I mean my requirement changes the game for them for a couple seconds, yet yours requires hours and hours of work.

Then in what universe are you not being a hypocrite for insulting me for telling others how to play when you're doing exactly the same thing?
---
&gt; They are not direct comparisons. My requirements: meet the common minimum. Your requirements: meet the common minimum and give me control of your decision making.
---
No, you're right, they're not direct comparisons, your requirements are actually impactfull in a meaningful way to the person you're requiring it from.

I remember tanking skellys on Nef doing that so it definitely was in vanilla.

Exploration is a gameplay feature. I didn't say wall jumping specifically was, I'm trying more to show how connected the two are, however. Obviously the exploration game isn't broken, but a lot of fun and famous locations are no longer accessible. There was no harm getting to Thunder Falls or the Airstrip, or a pretty little cliffside view of Westfall and the ocean from Elwynn Forest. With regards to furbolg rep, nerfing wall jumping doesn't stop people from skipping it. You can corpse crawl through it.
---
Again, I did not say wall jumping was a developed feature of the game. I'm saying that exploration and wall jumping are so interconnected, however, and that bug or not wall jumping is so utterly iconic of the vanilla experience that it warrants a comeback in some fashion, even if limited to specific easter egg locations that can't be exploited to bypass content. Blizz stated they've  [https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-classic-gameplay-vanilla-wow-server](https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-classic-gameplay-vanilla-wow-server) already for authenticity, and I personally think that as iconic as wall jumping is, at least some popular locations should be considered for addition as well.

Agreed. I never had beta invites to expansions until I cleared mythic endgame content, after which I got invites to every beta without even being subscribed. I haven't got classic beta though.

There's a server specifically for a stress test now whether that's to funnel everyone or just for stress test idk.

I think you‚Äôre underestimating how popular it‚Äôll be on launch. They‚Äôre trying to stay authentic in every other aspect I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd do this unless 100% necessary. Don‚Äôt forget people subbed to play BFA will more than likely check out classic for a bit. Servers will without doubt be overloaded it won‚Äôt be a mere slight qol upgrade or a 20 min queue.

What a piece of shit thing to do, Opt-in to a beta you have no plans on playing on. Not really much to gloat over, just shows what a selfish person you are.

nice.  can u add a feature for picking talent trees?
---
Sounds like you were in a casual guild. My experience was far from that as a Naxx raider.
---
Im surprised OP didn't respond. He has you covered for both factions. 
---
It's a bug with the tech, layering is basically just subservers, you do not shift between layers at random. It's only day 3 of the beta after all
---
I wear some TPS pieces like Lionheart and Ony Neck but mostly Tier 2. Also Wristguards of Trueflight, Don Julios, Blackstone Ring, can get onslaught but I dont have that. For prebis I wore Eldritch legs over Eternal Guardian most pf the time.

Do we know what Patch they are launching Classic at? 1.1?

So now you are saying you are willing to make the  healers lives more difficult so you can off tank in lionheart helm?!
---
I think you are getting confused, I am calling you out for claiming min maxing sensibility somehow gives you the right to have input on how people should spec, and you are lost in the tertiary argument that arms is a superior off tank spec then fury.
---
Either way, you are now basically arguing for wearing dps gear to tank... which again is pserver nonsense.

Been watching people streaming beta and consuming vanilla info. I haven't played in at least 10 years and the anticipation is keeping me from playing other games. I've thought about installing retail and taking a look at my old toons but I might as well wait until mid august.

Hum no ? I also play on private servers, I'm just not deluding myself thinking I will be godlike at the game or have more relevance to the beta process than other people because of the private server.
---
That's what I'm responding to and what the other comment clearly alluded to (you have to be delusional to think otherwise).

Most of the community always goes along what the select few test for them and then pretend to be expert when they didn't figure that shit out themselves and then DARE try to claim to be relevant or on par with "veterans", it's so pathetic it's making me laugh.

I don't remember the RTS games doing much in the way of retconning each other. It was more just establishing the official sequence of events for each game by pulling bits from both campaigns in each.

---
I get where you're coming from, but just don't think it's the case when it comes to systems like that. I think that the scaling system isnt present at all and that any inconsistencies we're seeing could be as simple as private servers having the wrong values.
---
WoW classic is the new WoW killer!
---
&gt;Corporations are going to go where the money is
---
Yes... which is exactly what I described they did. Microtransactions are designed to be desirable, but what I'm saying is they weren't invented without an obvious demand from the consumerbase.
---
And when it comes to the older generation, I honestly don't think they are by and large the ones demanding more challenging experiences. If you look at WoW more specifically I'd say the majority of people on retail who actually want the game to be dumbed down, i.e the plebs, are older people. The people who decide they "don't have the time" to play and just want to log in for quick fixes, and want those quick fixes to be obtainable by cash if they can't get it through quick and lazy gameplay. LFR was not invented for fresh players between the ages of 15 and 25, it was invented for the aging 40+ year old who couldn't commit to a fixed raiding schedule, and/or was always inept to the point where they couldn't raid.
---
What I think is that player retention will maybe be higher than people think possibly not by much but still higher (but it also depends on the state of retail, the more retail suffers, the more classic thrives I'd say).
---
If you bought the item and drop ur rank below u will be able to use them i think. As long as you bought previously though.

Mage, Druid, and Priest on Horde. Just not sure what order yet
---
I want Mage as a farmer/PvP and they are quick levelers. So I thought of doing a Troll Mage first but I want my Priest to a healer and raid so I feel I should probably level him up first to get in good with a guild early on. Then Druid will be one I just level periodically because its my favorite class and the same class I played in Vanilla (on Alliance though).
---
microdixk spotted
---
Ah ok wasn't aware that you're fixed to your layer blizz just confirmed it in blue post so good to see.
---
I'd be cool with 30 at a minimum. What should I look out for in a graphics card? It seems so confusing since it doesn't appear better graphic cards have a linear scale that are obvious to people like me. Besides a graphics card, what other specs will I need to run smooth?
---
haters will say it's fake
---
Depends if you consider PvE elements as "not a 1v1". Most of the time, its just about waiting for the other guy to engage an NPC.
---
I know its cool to shit on retail but saying that repair costs nothing atm is just wrong. Obviously it scales differently but it is still expensive for people that do not have huge bank. Just like it was in vanilla
---
Don't remember being able to snowball myself back in vanilla.
---
How does this work exactly? Does ancient scaling now apply to sets in reference to LoN?
---
I am looking to join a guild, but as a fathwr and a teacher i will not reach the raid seen as quickly as id like. Please let me know if you have any recommendations.

I don't understand. Someone explain.

Yea probably rank 10-11 with that. It‚Äôs a really steep increase to 12-14
---
That sounds like thow most of your average guilds were.  All but the hardcore, server-first, bleeding edge guilds really didn't care too much as long as you could show up on time, be prepared, and could perform your role.  If they could even muster up 40 people in the first place.

How‚Äôd u get there so fast without dying? I know it seems like a dumb question but the mobs there are like 35ish. Any single hit you die and corpse run but the timer goes up and up.
---
Orc is superior in both PVE and PVP.
---
**Rogue**
---
It's weird, because in most single-player RPGs that let me pick a class archetype, the "rogue" type class is usually my go-to. Some kind of melee hack and slash powerhouse. Or I'll go for the glass cannon mage type character.
---
But in all my years playing WoW I just can't get into rogue or cat druid. I don't like playing melee in WoW. Something about it rubs me the wrong way. It isn't very enjoyable outside of leveling content, but I've never even been able to get a Rogue past \~30 before I'm just done and play something else, or respec the druid I'm leveling to anything-but-cat.
---
I don't like DPSing in groups in general in WoW for some reason, but Rogue is definitely the one single class that just does not do it for me at all in any capacity and probably never will.
---
Weird setup here too, Frankenstein PC with Gen3 i7, DDR3, and a 1080.
---
What patch DID they add these in? I can't even remember. Was it in TBC pre patch?
---
So glad that Hunter and Druid are the two lowest. Maining a hunter, and likely will have a druid as my alt. Always enjoyed playing the class with a lower population.
---
Horizontal content would be  awesome!
---
Well first of all this game is based around RP, so i want people to see me as i intended them to see me. Then there's the problem with models. Maybe it will be easier to see the flag carrier in WSG with new models, or easier to see hunter laying traps because i think you could hide the trap animation in classic by jumping while this is not possible with newer models.
---
I feel that being able to buy a boost is part of the problem though -- it undermines the satisfaction of levelling for a lot of players including myself.
---
This should be enough proof that the sub count was based on hype and won't be sustained.
---
Nost and most vanilla servers after it have all been top notch.
---
All abilities generated some threat.  Putting a buff on someone, is essentially %0.001 threat, which would pull mobs that had no other threat on them other than proximity.
---
Hell, if I remember correctly, interrupting a spell actually gave you a ton of threat.
---
I was shown to have been updated to 8.0.1 build when it hit the CDN a month or so ago.

If you played on pservers and especially if you helped to betatest private servers before launch you should surely be more capable in finding stuff by feeling that something is wrong and looking up on Internet sources if it's true or not instead of being dude that all he had to do for the last few years is running mythic plus and having absolute no idea what's going on in the game. Especially after playing on different servers and seeing what varies often from one to another, what can be a tricky issue that can be tested, like, pathfinding, certain spell, mechanics, tricky bugs that should or shouldn't be a thing.

Nope, that was his record. 80k during BFA launch and he has 15-20k on a good normsl day.

---
Wake me up when we have ElvUI.
---
If that turns out to be private server nonsense then Id be stuck in prot spec for a long time probably. But if you can get thru MC in prebis, then why cant you get thru it in tier 1 + Lionheart? All evidence we have indicates that many raids are too hard on private servers, devs even admit they overtune them. But I will admit its posdible that we will alll need maxed out def stats.  
---
Yes its harder on healers. But they healed ypu in prebis. Thry can heal a slightly squishier version of you with raid gear. You basically make it harder for healers so your whole raid can do more DPS with increased threat.
---
that's why it's a beta
---
This sub has become such a toxic circlejerk. I imagine it will be reflective of the server, sadly.
---
It's a beta, it's meant to find bugs like these to prep for release

Warlocks and paladins got their mounts by doing a quest given by their respective trainers. You save 100g at level 40 but warlocks also had to buy their demon spells, so I think it evens out to some extent there. At 60 you did a quest chain that includes Dire Maul and turning in expensive mats. I had a lot of fun getting the dreadsteed stuff done with my guild. Never played a pally so I can't speak much on that.

---
Our MT was actually arms until SS buff and wore full tank gear.
---
Guess what? We progressed through most of vanilla content just fine, ( we even had a lot of dress wearers and our 1 Ret Paladin didn‚Äôt use nightfall)
---
Amazing what you can accomplish when you let the other 39 people spec however the fuck they want.
---
The paladins are downvoting you lol
---
Members of hardcore guilds were getting stared at quite a bit.  People never seen tier 3 gear or anything like that! Us lower guilds would also try to copy your specs!
---
Wtf are you talking about? You are missing my point
---
Lol oh god.. just remembered hitcapping
---
They need to bring these back along with the old style commercials. Also a new South Park episode would be really cool, although I dont think they would do it as South Park tends to only cover political subjects now.

Battle shout does (I think 255) threat if it buffs the entire party, this is split among all in combat mobs no matter the range. (could be the other side of the map). I believe demo shout hits all enemies in range for a flat 45 per mob) it comes down to this.
---
If mobs aggrod are under 5/6 it is better to spam battle shout while tabbing sunder/revenge (you may not even need sunder if your dps follows order) after this it is better to simply spam demo shout (see: imps/whelps)
---
I know everything gives threat but there has been a debate regarding battle shout as many used it when I was 14 to tank or at least we remember it that way. But some have said it only generates threat for the initial buff not refreshing. Which I'm looking to clarify now that Beta is out.
---
&gt;if you helped to betatest private servers before launch you should surely be more capable in finding stuff
---
Being a good tester is more relevant in this case than comparing to imitated info from private servers.
---
&gt;being dude that all he had to do for the last few years is running mythic plus and having absolute no idea what's going on in the game.
---
We were talking about Method Josh a person in a top raiding guild, able to test, use and even abuse mechanics and be of more use as a tester than someone who's only basis is wrong data.
---
It is very unlikely I would ever find anything you have to say on this matter interesting, so your  statement is false.

I‚Äôm sure all 13 of you will be thrilled!

But what about alts?
---
We all live in our own tiny little bubbles, even if we're playing the same game, we're not actually playing the same game.

Let me tell you how *I* remember vanilla
---
Days upon days of farming consumables/repair gold and leveling warlocks for the sole purpose of summoning to world bosses, while sitting on vent discussing every tiny thing we could do to improve our dps.
---
Logging in at 10 on a Saturday morning seeing 30 people online, 25 of which was either in SM farming grave moss or felwood farming tubers/ndb
---
Having people take shifts camping the lotus spawns so we could get them on a timer and having people designated to log in at a certain time to grab certain lotus spawns.
---
And finally the one that truly hurt: Spending 2000g in consumables/repairs on a single raid night.

---
You don't actually level as a healer, all classes that can heal have a DPS talent tree. Druids have feral, priests have shadow with wand specialization, shamans have enhancement and paladins have retribution. You can still heal dungeons with these specs as long as you have an intellect set.
---
There's absolutely no reason if you have a decent gaming mouse.
---
It definitely was in vanilla. In TBC it changed into [Dirge] spam.
---
Sorry, Jesus made me see the light.

It's a little too tinfoil hat of a theory for me. A better explanation for Classic proving more challenging than pservers would be that the pservers are inaccurate.
---

---
Fuck retail, the game sucks. But to think that we're not going experience an exodus of tourists is delusion. Classic is amazing game, but it really goes against the grain of modern gaming, which has a lot of instant gratification with practically no down time, and I believe some people are going to get to level 8 and realize that this isn't for them.
---
That doesn't take away from the glory of this game, nor is that some telling revelation on the state of Classic vs BFA.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/ seems to provide this really well. Is there something you want on top of that?
---
Yep, feels so much easier. I admit i‚Äôm comparing to private servers as well as memory though.

Anything less than the cost of a modern console and television and you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time. The bar for a budget-first PC build is usually $500. That doesn‚Äôt include a monitor, nor peripherals like M+KB or headset, just the box.

I think your best bet would be to buy a used gaming laptop several years old. It won‚Äôt be a great experience, and you‚Äôll still have to spend ~$400, but it‚Äôll do the job.
