Doesn't the armory require level 10 for your character to show up? I figure its like a pubg streamer who uses an overlay to hide their drop. They use an overlay to hide their server selection and the server name at the top of character select. This will only work for the first few hours obviously. I figure it would be a way to possibly give them a head start on their followers. 
---
bring it on!
---
I mean I understabd that, we all like classic, and I figured i came over as offensive. To me and many others i guess it looks like made up content to capitalize on hype or so. Its just that theres so many classic content creaters already, and ofc theres always room for more good content, but maybe start looking into issues or topics more than just why it was "good" or "social". Afterall, if you can dig up something interesting to talk about, youll get viewers by yourself. I hope you can get that for yourself

I'm personally all about that DINK life, but best of luck to the lot of 'ya!
---
Paladin. Fuck playing buffbot and spambot. Really really sounds tedious refreshing their buffs so often.
---
I have no interest in playing a paladin. I mained one from retail vanilla through Mists of Pandaria and it just doesn't appeal to me at all. It's a less interesting healing class than druid or priest and it's ineffective at anything else for end game PvE or more competitive premade vs. premade PvP. Yes, a great ret or reckoning paladin can be a good 1v1 class in PvP. They are strong duelists and have good matchups against every class except a priest or a really good warlock in that context, but playing one effectively requires a very defensive playstyle that just doesn't fit as well as an arms warrior or even a rogue would in group PvP. Who wants a dps player who plays defensively?

---
A Wrath of the Lich King or late Burning Crusade paladin on the other hand... that I could get into. You can fill a lot more roles that interest me in a lot of different gameplay modes.
---
Swamp of Sorrows took me a long time. Such a forgettable zone for Alliance. Surprised I got them all
---
I'm sorry you can't grasp what learning is. And how trivial it is to know something you didn't within the same moment. Driving a car must be hard for you. Each instant evaluated in its own moment with no context to reference. 
---
are you dutch? I watched your vid. Your voice is generally fine for videos, you should just pay more atention to pronouncing, talking loud and clear, and more engaging. I think you have potential
---
Druid. I just remember in vanilla, never seeing a Druid and thinking, ‚Äúman, they‚Äôre strong‚Äù. Which I pretty much did for every other class. 
---
Anyone else going to be playing 5p-8p EST after work hit me up! Early evening grinders!
---
Pretty much every unoriginal name the second the servers launch. And 99.99% never get used and sit on lv1 placeholders.
---
Undead at the graveyard in WPL 
---
This guy names.

I disagree. Creating and leading a guild is a lot of effort. I always assume the guild master will get the legendary if it's on class. I have always been of the opinion if you want a legendary you should be a guild leader.  Especially since HoR and TF come from MC. How hard would it be to make an MC guild?
---
But we do know. We have the database. We already know of every item and quest that exists in Vanilla WoW.

It's actually kind of odd. People love to insist that you can't be a very/little/mostly wrong, but I've never heard someone complaining about something being called a very/little/mostly right.
---
In any case, the English language is flexible enough to allow for almost any word to be graded in some way. *Very pregnant* is definitely a thing, so why can't someone be a *little pregnant*? And would you really have trouble to understand what a 109 year old means if he said that he felt he was already a little dead?

I still look at weapon dps. Never simmed anything. Don‚Äôt even know how. 
---
The interesting thing is that Retail *should* be the game I'd enjoy. But it isn't. My dad mates and I have actually tried it, and just found it dead boring. 
---
&gt;Why play a more difficult version of WoW with none of the quality of life features when what you seem to want is already available in retail?
---
Because we grew up with Warcraft. We played War 3 LANs on our college network and hauled our ungodly CRT monitors to each others houses for all night gaming sessions. We played D&amp;D 3.0 throughout the same period. We like roleplaying in an immersive world, and we like having a challenge. Retail offers us none of that. Now that's our take and it may very well vary for others. But that's why we're excited for Classic but have no interest in retail. 
---
&gt;What I would hate to see is folks who have kids and jobs and responsibilities jumping into classic wow, finding that the game is very limited if you are not able to commit the time, and then petition Blizz to nerf the game and add LFG so they can "see the whole game they paid for".
---
None of my group think that way. We want the game we played back in our early 20's, not something different. We know exactly what we're getting into and won't be asking for changes like that. 
---
Theres two in the Shimmering Raceway iirc. I feel like theres one for Grom'gol to meet the orc there, but I could be completely wrong. One in the raceway sends you to Nesingwary, the other to a guy in Booty Bay 
---
I'm wanting to look at why it did a good job socially and compare it a bit more to modern games. To hopefully understand and articulate a little more some of what has been lost in gaming and what we can focus on to bring it back.
---
I could make it about games as a whole, but I do have a special place in my heart for the memories I have of Vanilla and for me it _was_ the best social game I've played.
---
Yeah I thought the drop rate was 30% and I was unlucky, but I had a few different guildmates all tell me it‚Äôs 75%. So instead it‚Äôs just super unlucky!
---
Circle of Flame dropped in BRD for my Fire Mage. It was great. Wore that thing around even in TBC just for the RP.
---
&gt; Coming into classic with limited play time, the OP complains that he is not going to get to do dungeons because he will have too many interruptions, can't do raids because of the long time commitment and cant farm materials, which leaves us with leveling.
---
Why did you think I was complaining about that? I most certainly wasn't; I was simply pointing out that I won't be able to do some things. I'm totally fine with that. 
---
Depends on how you give it out at least. I got Sulfuras as the MT, but that's because I had more DKP than anyone else and spent it out the ass to get it (bidding system, at every raid, no other warrior wanted to spend their points to get any tanking gear, and no one was ever going to use it in a dungeon anyway). If he just got it because it was his guild, yeah, dumb.
---
Shaman. The thought of placing one totem down at a time gives me the sweats.
---
Shimmering flats sends you to Nesingwary. There is a quest in Ashenvale where you have to go to BB to get a delievery of axes. 
---
Overall though not every zone has pointer quests and most of the time they are very out of the way and not worth picking up. Sometimes though you need them to kick off a quest chain. The pointer you get in every capital that sends you to western plaguelands for example is very importnat without it you cant do the cauldron questchain.
---
It's my first time trying to really create any content of this nature, or to do any editing. It might take a few tries to get the rhythm and voice down, but then again maybe that's just how I talk.
---
I've been uploading a few videos to YouTube this past year, and it's been good for me to use it as a way to practice speaking more in this kind of manner, as it's not how you normally talk in conversation.
---
And nope! Not Dutch. Just not the most vocal of people. I _did_ spend last year in the Netherlands though. Gouda.
---
Thank you for the kind words.
---
The only thing I actually want them to change about classic is capping respec costs.  
---
I want to PvE and PvP in the same week, not switch every month.
---
Hopefully I figure out a good flow for creating content that isn't "just another video about talking about why it was a good game". I took some notes for how this one went... one of the notes is:
---
- create something other than saying 'vanilla wow was a great game'
---
    - not "This is why I feel Vanilla WoW made for such a great social game."
---
    - maybe "Analysing how Vanilla WoW did social interaction well"
---
    - yes "Looking at Vanilla WoW's Social Interactions"
---
A most splendid gift my dear boy. 
---
Whoooosh 
---
You can pull an entire instance and then have the leech log in and enter just before all the minions die. It only takes like 20s of played time per pull that can get you as much as a level.
---
That would be nice, but alas, i don't see it happening.
---
I wish i could remember the name of mine.. but it was a yellow dress with lots of sideboob.  Level 41-ish if i recall.. used that sucker all the way to 60!
---
Well props to you for presenting an actual unpopular opinion, contrary to what these "unpopular" threads are usually like.
---
That's about the only good thing I can say about your thread though.
---
Paladin
---
Paladin has been my main since BC ally side. But In Vanilla Paladins while powerful at what they do, buff and heal. They are so gimped and lame imo compared to how good they became in BC and on, I just cant bring myself to play a vanilla pally.
---
I've got two feet in the grave, just waiting for them to close the coffin at this point.
---
The discussion however, is obviously not about what is understood but what is the correct use of the language.  One could argue that if you are understood then you are using the language adequately.  Does that mean we should strive to only be understood?  When you say very pregnant we know what you mean from context.. the baby is almost done cooking.  Very has the unique ability of being used for emphasis in addition to grading.  You can be very right or very wrong.  Proclaiming something very wrong is akin to saying that statement was wrong from the start to the finish.  Not only was your premise wrong but your conclusions were wrong as well.  You're so far off base is an idiom that essentially means very wrong.
---
I was 19 and in my second year of university. I was playing my first character, a Tauren Warrior, and I was playing with a bunch of people I met through Diablo 2 forums/pvping and a couple of friends from school. I played WoW from day 1. I think I pulled at least one, maybe a few all nighters over Thanksgiving break to play. I ended up playing that warrior for a couple of years, getting pretty far with him before rerolling to join an Alliance guild on the same server.
---
Now I'm 33, married, with a 2 year old kid, living and teaching in Japan. I play Magic Online from time to time, play music more than I did when I played WoW, but still have a lot of the same hobbies, same music, etc. I'm not sure I'll get to play with classic, but I'm pretty much 100% for Warrior if I do. Tauren if the people I know go Horde, Human or Night Elf if they go Alliance.
---
You just said yourself that it isn't hard to make a guild and do it, but just before that said its a lot of effort. 
---
If your guild is about "progression" it goes to the MT, allows him to generate more TPS and allows others to open up. 
---
 If you join a guild and its clearly defined that your GM will be getting the legendaries before you head in thats one thing, but to down play everyone elses time and effort, asserting your position of master looter over others, well thats just plain shitty.
---
People vastly underestimate now noob the Classic playerbase will be. Mark my fucking words. Aside from, of course, hardcore guilds largely lead by pserver players, people are going to generally struggle with Vanilla for the first few months.
---
I have thought this through. The Classic community is ONE community, its not like im saying merge a retail and a classic server....Also, everyone thinks there is going to be a mass exodus, WHY? Why does everyone that loves this version of the game have so little faith it will keep people interested? Saying sharding is NEEDED to keep a community stable is ridiculous. Plain and simple.
---
Perhaps this is a good thing. Feels bad when it's taken, but then again... if half my guildmates were named after popular WoW characters I don't know how that would have gone.
---
They would fuck it up, I prefer TBC. 
---
Mine too. Was struggling to remember till I read this. I was obsessed with that shield.
---
My fondest memory is scraping up all my gold across 4 characters to buy a 7 gold helmet on the AH because it looked cool. It was an int/stam leather helmet that I wore on my rogue for about a month. I was 6.
---
Best mastery was shot until it got reworked. 
---
If your pet lost aggro then you probably had not growl on your pet. If you had your pet would never lose aggro. Every pet can learn growl.
---
You find a Tauren named Roon in Shadowprey Village in Desolace who gives you a quest to bring his Kodo horn to Hemet Nessingwary.
---
AV is Phase 2. Not going to help your main. 
---
Please god confirm RP-PvP servers, Blizzard
---
The hardcore players forming a majority of guilds right now won't be interested in them. But we exist.
---
Paladin. I'd rather not play than play Alliance.
---
&gt;So with all that considered i think im pretty happy with what ever they decide to do with classic. Just enjoy it and take it in cause this will probably be the last *GOOD* MMO we will see.
---
Let's hope it's worth enjoying, when it comes out. For all we know at the moment, could be handled incredibly lazily.
---
Come on mate, just a few more hotpockets!
---
Basic business sense doesn't tend to rule in old, established companies. In general, the people who run things just don't want to loose their jobs, if the company slowly leaks money (which this applies to essentially all big video game companies) it doesn't matter to them as long as they can ride the ship as long as it floats. Up and coming businesses generally have great business sense, for instance Blizzard when they created WoW.
---
Same boat. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable gaming while the kids are awake. When I‚Äôm not doing anything important like cooking for them or whatever, I‚Äôm with them to play and just hang out. 
---
Never thought about that as being a thing. Huh, I guess people do that.
---
Keep cap at 60.
---
Too many op builds would become available with 31/21, and it would become the standard, not the exception.
---
Realists can still be fun. It's just a coincidence that I'm not.
---
Hybrid-brid dps and tanking are almost like roles that they decided were obsolete. They aren't good design for group play as groups would prefer everyone to specialize. That being said they were some of the funnest things to play.
---
wait, you want a guide to find guides? Why hasn¬¥t anyone thought of that? A whole new world of 10 minute videos right there. 
---
On a related note, what realistic goals are all you classic parents setting for yourselves?
---
Personally, I want to get an entire dungeon set 2, but I'm still trying to decide which class has the most viable set.
---
krol blade here
---
Comcast has a monopoly, WoW provides a game and is paid monthly to be fun. When you guys say "we know they don't give a shit" I can't help but laugh at how irrational you are
---
I won¬¥t do this quest or I¬¥ll have an occupied bank slot forever. 
---
Bullshit arcane mages were so OP at one point
---
Dad here.  About those headphones cutting you off, I had a similar feeling.  Then I picked up some ‚Äòopen backed ‚Äò headphones and they are perfect!
---
They are not sealed, so you get better sound out of them and they are open so they allow external sound to pass in with zero issue.
---
Works perfect because I can very clearly hear the wife when or kiddos when they ask me something.
---
They do emit sound into the room too, but it‚Äôs all but inaudible so profanity is not a concern!
---
This is a good point. Respecs can cost way too much vs the gold you earn in vanilla 
---
It's not "their" game, it's the game of talented, trustworthy people who no longer work there.
---
I was in 10man LSTRAT after months of leveling with my IRL friend. I was a fire mage and the Eye of Flame dropped! My friend was so jealous that I got an epic before him! It was good times back then we were such noobs. I can't wait for classic!
---
Let me parse my statement more carefully. It is very hard to run a progression guild that is good and effective. It is not that hard to organize 40 monkeys every week to spam the same easy tier 1 raid.
---
As far as it being shitty to use your position of guild master to get loot. It can be if you are a giant whore all the time about it. That being said. Leadership has it's rewards and the stuff has always gone to leaders. Thats just how it works. Everybody wants a slice of cake. Yet ask them to bake a cake. It's crickets. In this cake making a guild is the cake and being the baker has it's rewards.
---
My 1st character spent so much damn time there. After leveling I‚Äôd always go back just for farm &amp; mine.
---
Lhƒìer≈ì
---
instant friendlist
---
I would say Druid, they are just a mess in classic. The only good thing they do is run flags in wsg and run around in circles during 1v1's
---
Questing and leveling became a mandatory chore before raids, aka "the real game", a massive part as to why retail is hot garbage. Everything became second to raids, the only thing that natters in retail.
---
People want an open mmo, not an instance based arpg.
---
People being motivated to insulate their egos from criticism. Yeah, sounds nuts.
---
What side did you play on? 
---
Northrend too. They sure were ambitious with this game. 
---
There's no Korrak in 1.12
---
&gt;The Classic community is ONE community
---
That's idealistic. Retail doesn't feel like "one big community". Merging two existing communities will be disruptive, if not for the people sharing character and guild names, but for how suddenly half of the server will consist of people you've never seen before. Realm communities matter above everything else.
---
&gt;Also, everyone thinks there is going to be a mass exodus, WHY?
---
Because it is natural for a large number of people to jump back into a game and check it out before leaving once the hype wears off. This happens with every game, including wow expansions. 
---
Add into the mix that the retail subscription IS the classic subscription too, there's going to be a lot of tourists.
---
&gt;I have thought this through.
---
I don't think you have :p
---
&gt;Saying sharding is NEEDED to keep a community stable is ridiculous. Plain and simple.
---
Life isn't simple.
---
Skull flame shield drop on my warlock. Sold it to fund my 60 mount quest line. Fun times indeed.
---
Many people tend to forget that during vanilla the player base got bigger by each patch.
---
Some were playing before patch 1.3, but much more after.
---
WoW EU release date was on February 11, 2005 version 1.2.1. 
---
Dire Maul Patch 1.3 was released March 7, 2005.
---
One month to level to 60 was by no means a long time for a normal player during vanilla. 
---
Another thing to mension MC was added in Patch 1.1.0 on November 7, 2004.
---
First Kill-List:
---
Lucifron 01 - 20 - 2005
---
Magmadar 01 - 26 - 2005
---
Gehenas 01 - 29 - 2005
---
Garr 01 - 29 - 2005
---
Geddon 01 - 29 - 2005
---
Shazzrah 01 - 29 - 2005
---
Sulfuron Harbinger 01 - 29 - 2005
---
Golemagg -
---
Majordomo Executus 02 - 10 - 2005
---
Ragnaros 04 - 25 - 2005
---
How much people begun to raid MC in the first four months till DM release and how much after DM release till Burning Crusade release (21 Months)? Which raid experience is "vanilla"? 
---
Tend to say DM is negligible. 
---
Debuff slots was a thing in patch 1.7.0, would be okay to say it nerfed MC a bit. 
---
It would be all things together (knowledge, better players, debuff slot, some talents, ZG equip, T0,5,... ) that take part in nerfing mc over time. 
---
I played WoW since Patch 1.5, but Patch 1.12. 
---
I got this bow as well. I was 8 or 9 at the time in BC and didnt understand how bind on equip worked... I think you see where this is going.
---
I got that on my hunter and I thought I was the shit hahaha
---
&gt;Griefing is a bannable offense nowadays. 
---
WTF?  90% of Vanilla griefing and it was awesome.
---
Not really no. We don't know from pservers.
---
 
---
The only pserver recently that has done 1.12 itemization is kr0n0s, and has completely different values than lightsh0pe so the difference isn't comparable. 
---
Honestly MC/BWL is easy as fuck already, getting some more gear really doesn't change shit. But on the other hand, MC/BWL really doesn't need even less difficulty. 
---
It rly doesn't matter because MC is so easy. Remember it was cleared after TEN days on recent pserver without any of this. 
---
I honestly would not mind if putlanda were made into a level 60 area and somehow avoided powercreep that came from TBC
---
Respec decay is not confirmed yet. 
---
Which is exactly my point. The guy I‚Äôm responding to thinks that because a Hybrid role‚Äôs main rotation is dealing damage that means that is their primary reason and focus for being in a raid, as if they were just another Warlock/Mage/Warrior. 
---
You spell it out perfectly. A Hybrid‚Äôs role is about utility, not DPS. I‚Äôd rather an Enhance that did zero DPS (Nightfall swings notwithstanding) and had his Totem and mana management down to a science. 
---
Arcane Mages or 2 min Ap ToEP Hakkar's Heart mages?
---
Loved Nagrand in BC, but those floating islands would have to stay a mystery.
---
Anything newer - best for bigger noobs who want to think they are newer &amp; specialerrrrr.
---
Hey everyone so I'm pretty set on warrior for my classic class. Just wondering for professions what might work best. I'm thinking mining/blacksmithing as one combo; not sure on weapon or armor Smith I would have to recheck those. Or herb/alc as the alternative.
---
 I feel like herb and alc would net me good gold, enough to buy blacksmith items anyway. I dont mind farming so that could be a plus to farming a crap ton of herbs, same could be said for farming alot of ores though. Any thoughts? 
---
True, but it depends how they actually do that stuff. There's also naxx in 1.12, that doesn't neccesarily mean we will have naxx at release does it? no.
---
don't matter. nobody should be called subhuman bruh. totally uncalled for
---
Spoken like someone who has no idea how Vanilla server implementation even works. 
---
I can‚Äôt type the name of the most popular ex-pserver, but Google their 80 page Post-Mortem paper and educate yourself first. 
---
I love Hurricane. :)
---
Knowing me, I'll never ever use it ever. Items that can only be used once might as well never be usable, because I'm never considering any situation worth it.
---
Are you telling me shamans might just yet get their actual talent tree rework in classic!!!!
---
(They were the only class not to get a revamp talent tree, just a slight update)
---
I know that people have done that with runescape
---
Leroy
---
But if I don't speculate now, how the hell am I supposed to brag about how right I was later on?
---
Yeah, I'm not worried about those changes, security is pretty damn necessary and it sounds like they're taking care with the gui changes by making them optional. But I'm 80% sure they're gonna fuck up the looting system, sharding could ruin everything if it's permanent, and I strongly suspect they'll wreck the economy with those pay-to-win tokens. Just give us the damn game we've wanted back for a decade, is that so hard?
---
I was some dork in highschool.
---
Less.of a dork, now I just work...
---
I only regret I have but one upboat to give.
---
More like "People who sell WoW names the millisecond Classic drops."
---
I did... gearing up in dungeons pre-raid was a huge part for both Vanilla and TBC and was often how people met future guild members, like we did for example. Surely much smoother with your guildies so it was relevant. Also gearing up people in dungeons that you needed for your raids was important if you lacked certain roles/classes. Everyone is talking about pre-raid BIS now but back then ppl didn't even know exactly what that meant, so you needed even more dungeon runs to gear up properly. Surely if you started to have raids on farm you could just drag ppl through that were not properly prepared for them. But saying dungeons weren't relevant for guilds is just ignorant.
---
I don't see what that could have to do with what I just said. It's a common human motivation.
---
Very good write up but it basically confirms my suspicion that this forum is a secret wrath baby hide out. Your analysis of them turning Arthas into a comic book villian is spot on. 
---
Go watch the wc3 cinematic when he comes home from Northrend to meet his father. Truly chilling, thats the true Arthas.
---
You say you never hit cap until wrath but still put judgement down on vanilla and tbc. In my experience the people that played a lot of max level in vanilla and tbc couldn't bear what they did to the game in wrath,  and every expac since has just been more down the same road.
---
Paladin seems to be a really polarizing class, which is interesting.
---
Me, I'd say warrior. A ton of competition for dps gear, not a great leveling experience, and I really like to be a healer on endgame. I strongly appreciate all my warrior bros, but I'd never be one. Count on me to keep you alive though.
---
Hey, at least Mage Armor now has a new, unique ic- Oh, damnit, you already made the joke.
---
What race/class/spec are y'all gonna play? I loved my priest back in the day and I loved being a healer but levelling holy in TBC was a nightmare, I can't imagine what it'll be like in vanilla 
---
I've been camped many times.  I generally turn it into a game of escaping the camp.  I carry invisibility potions as soon I can afford them.  I've never understood why people whine about camping beyond calling some guildies out to counter gank. 
---
I generally don't camp people because it's boring as fuck.  I might go around looking for other people to kill and then return to the spot again to check, but I never hang around in the same spot for an extended period.
---
Same bro. Been waiting 15 years to get those. Literally was on the phone with my cuz while he did bwl laughing his ass off bc 10 storms kept dropping and getting DEd all night. Was freaking out.
---
Oh no 
---
"Do I want them to tweak them or add more and play with itemization? Sure."
---
You are the enemy.
---
Paladin.
---
It would imply I have rolled alliance.
---
Don‚Äôt let them get a talent; just a couple extra stats and a new level of gear from a new raid or something f. 
---
I hope they have the same server names. Wanna rejoin my Mal'Ganis bros
---
Asmon the largest wow streamer on twitch is going to play pve

---
Same boat here, brother! I don‚Äôt know why, but I assumed I was alone in this boat. Then bam! I stumble on this post. :) We should all coordinate and form a guild! :D
---
As far as my playing, it will be limited. I‚Äôm looking most forward to leveling. An occasional 5 man might be nice, maybe some battle grounds. It would be nice to do those things with people who get that wow isn‚Äôt my life, and yes I may die occasionally! LoL!
---
There's a reason I didn't say, "Realists seem fun."
---
Lol can you not just run from a GM lollll
---
Didn't get my first mount until 45. Felt like a badass running around Tanaris on my nightsaber when I finally got it 
---
Mine was a level 40ish sword from a random vulture in the desert. 
---
My friend was like, "where did you get that...?"
---
Lol! Not the case tho people generally accept that the expacs post wrath especially when mop hit have been on the downturn.
---
Except legion which many have a strange acceptance of even tho imo same dumpster fire tier as the rest.
---
No chnages
---
you should, bozo
---
That's by design. They didn't want you swapping specs every other day. 
---
But are you over the 350lb wight mandatory to roll as one?
---
But with a few changes...
---
I'd like to introduce you to my point.
---
Making water for a 40 man raid, 4 at a time.. Oh that was fun.
---
Skullflame shield! 
---
Dropped in UD Stratholme. Instant equip!
---
I think we need to make this happen!
---
I wouldn't even mind if all the current areas like Northrend and Pandaria are visible on the classic map even if we can't go there. They exist so they should be there. 
---
Not Pandaria I guess since it's hidden, but it was an example 
---
Mighty fine shell you got there Mr. Turtle. It‚Äôd be a shame if... someone ripped it off your corpse and used it for a shield.

Can you post them without the world of warcraft logo?
---
What‚Äôs common is this little irrational temper tantrum you‚Äôre throwing in this pointless thread. 
---
I should of noted that LFR Dragon Soul got me into raiding aswell. I am a wrath baby despite starting before then I suppose, but I have read books worth of information about vanilla and I feel confident enough for the sparse tidbits of judgement I gave there. But perhaps I shouldn't judge TBC at all for anything but flying.
---
Blizzard is trying to stay true to 1.12 to some degree with instances being locked out and PVP items won't be in until BWL being released. Korrak has gone through many different patches before he was removed. It's very likely they will use the last version of AV for Wow Classic. 
---
Druid or warrior. I'm torn between priest, (levelling healer is a nightmare) Mage because frost seems like a lot of fun and portals/food are useful or warlock, because I loved my warlock in tbc and they're useful for summoning and the demons are handy to have around  
---
You sound like the one who's getting emotional and personal. I've accepted that the game isn't gonna be what the fans wanted for months now, I'm at peace with it.
---
Wait, dazed isn't a thing anymore?
---
It makes me wish games didt stop u from gettin xp when something is too far below your level. I dont want level scaling either, just make things give a set amount of xp always. Maybe limit the max to prevent power leveling at most.
---
Yeah I know but I'd still like to. Even back when we had to pay to respec people wanted to have the option but now being able to swap to any spec on the fly has really spoiled us. Gonna be hard(ish) to choose one and stick with it. Mounts are expensive, I ain't gonna be wasting money on respecs
---
Yeah that one took me a minute... i never really considered it its own zone since its in hillsbrad.
---
I care about the long term health of the game, which is why I fully support all the changes. 
---
Unfortunately they won‚Äôt go far enough: Without a legitimate source of RMT chinese gold farms will return in full force. 
---
Damn when i read all of this here i feel bad for myself :^)
---
I was 13 in 2004 played an Undead Mage in the Beta
---
Now i am 27, unemployed since 2017 and fight with Depression and anxiety disorder. I have no Kids, not married. Atleast i have a loveable Girlfriend since 3 Years who loves me how i am.
---
But hey one Day Life get's better right?
---
I am all onto the Classic Hype and i will play an Undead Mage once again. :)
---
Forgot that the cities were in fact zones...
---
I love levelling alts. I'm probably not even going to raid, just level but god damn it'll take forever in classic
---
Can't fucking wait for this game
---
Elemental Mage Staff
---
Shame the server cap is 10 isn't it? Sucks when you have to roll on a new server 
---
Keeping them a secret personally. The odds of us being on the same server is probably slim but still don't want to chance it.
---
I'm the same as you. My favourite part of wow is levelling new alts, I don't think ill even raid in classic but it takes so long to hit 60 in vanilla 
---
Doesnt matter if youre 35, youre still going to ask your mom for her credit card to even play.
---
A bad rogue won't kill you before the stunlocks end... if they can't kill you or very close to it in the opener they are sitting ducks unless they have vanish.
---
I honestly want some quality of life changes. Nothing major but as some people have pointed out, attaching several items in mail etc. Just quality of life is all. No need to be absolutely *no changes* for the sake of it right? 
---
lol the only paladins that survive my opener are the ones who have bubble off CD. Better hearth before that bubble ends cuz im gonna vanish and wait for that bubble to end.
---
Got 44/46 ... forgot Redridge and Felwood
---
Same situation, not likely to raid either. 
---
I usually game once the kids are asleep, so after 9pm (PST here) so tend to use headphones so the kids/wife don't hear it, and don't use the mic for the same reason.
---
If we setup a Dad's guild I'd be SUPER interested :)
---
Don't worry, I'm quite sure they'll legitimize pay-to-win with that token system. If the gold farmers are little kids who can't afford a subscription, how exactly is that better?
---
why the rogue hate? some of us are nice players who just want to be sneakybois and be one of the top dps in raid. I have actually been known to help horde if I pass by them and see them close to death fighting a mob. If they aggroed too many ill actually wait for them to tag them all before helping so I don't take their kills. Some people just want to raid and have fun.
---
I hope rogues stay low. 
---
Its not that bad, just keep windfury and mana spring down between bosses, and drop all 4 at the bosses 
---
Perfect! Name one nostralius!
---
I mean just look at current retail WoW to get an idea of why they are going back to WoW Classic. If the team were capable of making a great game it would've been done already. I wouldn't trust them not to f it up. 
---
Anyway for this to happen would require Wow Classic to be a massive success and even still, it would be hard for Blizzard not to look over at TBC and recycle it's content for easy money. 
---
Back in vanilla I had 2 french canadians in my guild. One of them spoke english like it was his first language. The other didn't really speak it at all. It was always cool to hear the RL explain the fight then we got to hear the english speaking french canadian explain it to the other guy in french. Some people may get annoyed by it but I thought it was cool.
---
I‚Äôm not so sure. Most people will come with retail experience and all the raid encounters in MC are very easy mechanically. You might be right, but I don‚Äôt know how you have such confidence in it.
---
They will have to whether they like it or not. Unless they want to spend 100% of their time in a major city or be summoned to every instance they want to run.
---
Your rogue list is spot on. Oto's rogue guide is a good read for anyone who wants to play rogue in vanilla and hasn't before.
---
Holy cow I'm being downvoted for saying vanilla had more content than BFA! Is this the classic wow reddit am I lost?
---
Ok let's try to look at this objectivley.
---
Content= stuff to do.
---
First, leveling experience in vanilla spans enormously more content and literally thousands of quests. 
---
TBc and bfa are probly about the same.
---
Second, vanilla has 20 different dungeons and more if you split up BRS and SM.
---
TBC has 16
---
Bfa has 10
---
Also the dungeons themselves had a purpose to be run because there was no lfr, so they are actually utilized as content because you dont just skip over them with better options. Not to mention the difficulty of them made for more content, because they took longer than 10 minutes to complete.
---
Third raids- vanilla has 7
---
TBC has 9
---
BFA has 3 and we can generously say by the end of its cycle it will have 5.
---
Fourth, pvp. Vanilla had actual sandbox openworld pvp frequently
---
TBC is a middle ground with some of this arena.
---
Bfa has arena... and some open world pvp that gets basically ruined by sharding.
---
5- I'm gonna just go out on a limb here and say that both vanilla and tbc were growing at the end of their cycle, so people clearly had meaningful and fun content to do. BfA had people whining and leaving in droves within weeks. If this doesnt speam to a vast chasm of difference between amount and quality of content, then idk what does.
---
I'd pay for it of course but it's pure greedy if they do it.
---
Mine was a Gut Ripper I pickpocketed off of a pirate near the coast of Booty Bay.
---
I respeced into daggers immediately.
---
Of the people
---
I played Vanilla back in 2006 when I was 18 years old. I'm now 31 with 3 year old twins. My playing of Classic will be focusing on the experience and nostalgia. I don't plan on playing competitively, my goal is just to have fun. I'll have 2-3 hours a night to play after the boys go to bed.
---
My personal goal is to get one of every race to level 60, with 1 of every class except Rogue (I was never a fan of the play style).
---
I remember farming fire resistance mats forget what the area was called but they were night elf looking demons. Trying to impress my b list guild tonlet a newb OT MC
---
I ran a hybrid balance/resto spec. The talents in the balance tree were for mana efficiency and things like that. They werent for dps. You get a lot out of the resto tree but don't take swiftmend. I used 3/4 HT mostly and rejuv on fights like Ony with deep breath. I can rejuv a bunch of players to get their hp ticking up before the next fear/deep breath. paladins will probably spam heal them up but you only have so many healers so it helps. I never really use regrowth at all. I keep it on my bar though just in case.
---
You're cherry picking and arguing non points. 
---
Once again. Percentage wise there are just more activities in this current xpac. I don't care about the number of dungeons, quests, and raids. Because those are one thing to do. This xpac has other things to do besides those three things.
---
I love vanilla, and am excited for it to come back around. But I feel like your points are being made with a bull head instead of listening to what I'm saying. 
---
Wait till you play it bro. You can read all day but just know your in for an incredible ride.
---
Don't be a dwarf if you don't want. Every guild will want a dwarf priest but there will be priests of all races mostly.
---
Not sure for warlocks but its pretty required for a rogue. It depends how the meta develops due to 16 debuff slots. Warlocks couldn't use their dots before because there were better debuffs. Who knows in Classic.
---
How will the token system be pay to win? They have already stated you won't be able to buy and sell tokens on the classic servers.
---
Taking part in that event was amazing. Not being able to login when the even started was also amazing lol
---
I was 18 or 19 and a college student. I played way too much WoW and didn‚Äôt give a shit about school as a result but still managed to muddle my way to ok grades in my first two years.
---
I‚Äôm a lawyer now so I‚Äôve basically worked my way into a career that will prevent me from playing classic...
---
I agree with you regarding leaving the max level at 60, however, for each expansion content added to the game it doesn't make sense to leave the previous raids as raids. The idea I had in mind would be, along with a stat squish you would implement a level squish. The level squish I am thinking would work in the following way, everyone above level 45 would be brought back down to level 45, and those below level 45 would stay at that level.
---
The new expansion content would include quests in new zones which would level you from 45 to 60. The previous raids would become 5 man dungeons and you introduce the new raids as level 60 all over again.
---
I could finally get my enh shammy tank!

(A guy can dream)
---
Yeah it seems like they are posting more but just responding to threads as if they weren't CMs. It makes people feel better to see blue posts but they aren't really doing much yet.
---
Staff of Jordan from the gorillas outside booty bay, sold it for my level 40 mount and bought kang the decapitator
---
Paladin was so boring to play in vanilla. 
---
Interesting but then that would just go the same way wouldn't it? I guess they could give people time to burn out on Classic and have their fill of nostalgia/take off the rose tinted glasses. Personally I'm hoping for TBC servers 
---
Oh beautiful! I hadn't heard that.

Combat riposte is amazing for leveling. Imagine fighting a melee class and you disarm them. gg.

I am literally listing every facet of the game and trying to see how you can possibly believe what you are saying.

I give facts, and once again all you have mentioned is island expeditions.

So I give you the opportunity to refute these facts, which you have not been able to do.

I've literally never used it. I always keep it just incase, then put it in the bank as an antique. Might just use it in my first fight after I get it otherwise i never will

I basically don't game before 8pm (kids go to bed around 7:30pm) - My kids have no idea that I'm a gamer.  They think my computer is for work.  If I hear them stir I tend to just alt-tab or alt-f4 depending on whether other players are relying on me or whether I'm soloing.  Most people are understanding that fam comes first.
---
That being said, I am worried that classic will have me staying up to stupid hours of the night and I would rather have my rest so I can maintain my health and fitness.  
---
Go kill boars in the woods obviously. How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Felwood? 
---
If they bring back the old servers it will be easy. Scarlet Crusade will be my home again.
---
Yup
---
Teldrassil no question. I was listening to the wow soundtrack on pandora today and the nelf music just cant be beat.
---
blacksmith changeable hammer, i tanked ulda with it
---
BGs are not being delayed, it is the gear rewarded from Ranks that is being delayed. The PvP Gear when it comes out is great for Hunters in PvP and is worth grinding towards as r10 can be done casually.
---
Dragon soul is generally considered one of the worst raids of all time and fire lands was like an MC reskin.
---
I'm not saying the endgame was the worst it's been but I certainly dont see it competitive with either tbc or vanilla.
---
Horde
---
Just try to remember that when the game launches there will be a ton of people so you may be slowed down even more.
---
üòÇ I was thinking about that but I couldn‚Äôt remember what the range was 
---
Dinged 60 for the first time in WS. Was a big day for 14-year-old me
---
If I can complete the quest solo I get more xp per kill than even a group of 2 people. Then I turn in the quest and get the same amount. They may need to grind a bit later on but I will not because I got the most amount of xp possible while they split xp. If you are efficient you can beat groups every time. Well unless its like a hunter mage combo probably... cant compete with the AoE farm.
---
Yes, somewhere between vanilla and tbc would be the perfect wow. But of the actual games and their execution I retain my view.
---
Old AV is one of the biggest appeals to vanilla it would be completely retarded to use the 1.12 nerfed version instead..
---
Nope, my BMI is about 16-17, so I REALLY need to pack on the pounds for that. And in general.
---
Aren't we all :)
---
I think there's also a Salt Flats follup to get some stuff from the elite murlocs in STV as well.
---
Gift of the wild, Rebirth, and the ability to heal on the run are great for raiding and PVP. 
---
100% !
---
Struggled with Loch Modan and Darnassus! Great fun for 10 mins!
---
You are listing specific details that I'm not even making a case of arguing for. Earlier I said agree to disagree and you're still going on and on. 
---
Numbers
---
Vanilla- explore, dungeons, raids, quests, bgs, open pvp, crafting, twinks, rp
---
Currently- explore, dungeons, raids, quests, bgs, open pvp, crafting, twinks, rp, islands, warfronts, world quests, transmog farming, achievement farming, battle pets collecting and battles
---
There is just more content now.

Damn that brings back memories.
---
My only GM interaction was when one of our party mates somehow got stuck in the floorboards on the ship in Deadmines. IIRC, he was a mage, and blinked onto the boat from the ramp...not that it's important.
---
The weird thing was this half-man mage was aggroing everything in the instance (probably due to corrupt position data) so we put in a ticket.
---
A GM spawned in the instance in these fucking sweet robes and chatted with us for a while, and then *NO SHIT* went over to our stuck mage and TEABAGGED him five or six times before fixing him.
---
We were dying laughing.

We will play together again. I have pictures of her as a baby on my lap while we raided ZG in 2006-ish. Everything that is old is new again.

Of course we will. Patch 1.12. doesn't mean we won't be able to do this Event.

Yep! Circlet of Flame. DRopped for me in when I was rolling my first toon and couldn't WAIT to get to max level for WoD content. I still use that in 90% of my mogs these days. It also took me FOR. EV. ER. to get my second one. I think I just got super lucky and then had an unrealistic expectation...at least until LFR/mythic+
---
He answered your question above. apparently someone had an auto invite mod and thats how they got in.
---
Wanting original itemization isn't "no changes". 1.12 itemization in old content is. 4 patches also is nothing like vanilla. 
---

Its more than prebis but it has all specs.
---
Like I said, savages!
---
Would you say the same for Taladril's? His list seems to take into account 1.12.
---
I don't particularly like grinding/farming unless I have a big reason to do so, but when I just want to chill I love swimming along the coast (with a trusty stack of swim speed and water breathing pots) and finding lonely isolated places. There's quite a few little islands, empty caves, and the occasional shipwreck, sometimes even with a chest. I really love the far, forlorn, out of reach places you can find that pretty much no one else goes to. I remember one time in vanilla I came across a random shaman, dressed in all white gear, just sitting on this tiny island with a tree in the middle of absolutely nowhere. I had to swim south for like 20 minutes, staying near the coast so I didn't get fatigued, to even come across it. I remember the adjacent zone didn't even have a beach, just a big rock wall. I greeted him and he waved and gave me water walking, and said no more. I left him to his lonely vigil. If you're still out there, island hermit, I hope you've found the peace you sought!
---
How will they be forced past 19 if they never quest again? 
---
Ah, ok I get it. So achievements, battle pets, and transmogging make up the content difference to you.
---
Well at this point I will have to agree with you that we have a vastly different opinion on what content means.
---
wtf is this DB, why did someone make a new DB when we had one made years ago and is the best http://classicdb.ch
---
From my memory AV has had 4-5 major patch changes.
---
Patch 1.11.0 wasn't a good version cause you could rush to the end in 15- 20 mins if you really wanted to.
---
Patch 1.10.0 were like 1 hour games and Korrak was removed
---
Patch 1.8.0 had Korrak moved to Snowfall grave yard and all the NPC's were nerfed greatly. You still had long ass games.
---
Patch 1.6.0 was NPC hell and 24 hour games. Korrak was a pain in the ass to kill.
---
Personally I like patch 1.10.0 as the main objective of AV was to win the game and the games were long enough. 
---
Mine was hurricane as well. A bear on the way out of camp...mojache? In feralas dazed me, so I dismounted. Out of anger I whipped around and killed him even though he was gray. Clicked and saw the purple and freaked. Pretty sure I was a 50 something warrior. Good times.
---
I don't think you realize how much of a nerf talents and itemization are. Take a class like Warrior. One handed Fury wasn't even viable. In 1.12 they are top dps. 1.12 is acceptable due to pvp. On top of those changes you now have locks that were only brought for banishes doing = dmg to mages in tier 1 and 2. Another huge buff. Nightfall is a broken item if it releases with Classic.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169)
---
The original release of that item was 1.11 Nax. So that is a nerf to AQ as well. 
---
[https://www.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall)
---
We will have exactly two raids even close to what was vanilla was like as it currently stands. Naxx and AQ and only Naxx is in it's original state. In addition you will end up with ZG being quite a bit harder than tier 1 and 2 if you don't fix itemization/patch structure. This would be really, really stupid as it's meant to be a starter raid.
---
People aren't exactly asking for the moon here. Spread out the patches more and do itemization at least as good as Nost did. It isn't about making it "challenging" or "Mythic content", it's about requiring people to be in a guild and be social. Tier 1 and 2 will be easier than Naxx in WOTLK and we pugged that.
---
The hardest part of being a shaman is carefully tailoring your 4 totems to a specific encounter, laying them down, drinking to mana up--and then watching as the tank charges away and fights them 30 meters outside of the effective range. Especially hard as a shaman healer when you really need that mana and running into the thick of battle to drop them (4 GCDs) is potentially putting your party at risk.
---
I thought that might be what you were saying but, "add more" threw me.
---
My favorite guild of all time was Crimson Legacy on Scarlet Crusade. The guild was great. The GM and a few of the higher ranking officers had to quit for real life reasons for a while. I was druid class lead. The mage lead whispered some of the better players in the guild including me about leaving and forming our own guild. I told him i'd leave just to stay in the loop but I loved the guild and didn't want it to break up. It eventually did and myself and the warrior class lead stayed as long as possible to help others find new guilds and explain to people who were offline when it happened. I eventually got invited to Blood and Honor as a healer because I had a friend in that guild who said they needed a healer. One BWL trial run and I was in. I said my goodbyes to my remaining guildmates and thanked the warrior for helping me and everyone else through those rough times. They understood and I recall the warrior being in a good guild at some point. I wish I remembered that warriors name. I believe it was a human female. If you are out there thanks again for the help. I was Rozencrantze the resto druid. My reddit name is the same obviously lol.  
---
I really hope Scarlet Crusade is an option this go around. I'd love to see some of my old friends from back then. Especially, Montare the warlock who took me under his wing and showed me good gold farming spots and what to do as a new raider. That was before I was made class lead obviously.   
---
If anyone was on scarlet crusade and remembers Crimson Legacy let me know!
---
Gods, how I hated that fad...
---
I remember running max back in wotlk and everybody would troll in general. One day they were talking about how GMs never pay attention to chats or whatever and one responded in general saying ‚Äú We‚Äôre always listening...‚Äù was hella funny at the time. General went crazy over it.
---
Prime example of the classic community right here. Word spreads and fast. 
---
Mine dropped in SM.  My first epic. Thought I was gonna conquer the world. 
---
If they didn't merge PVP stats in retail, my 7,000+ hour paladin would still have 0 HKs. So no.
---
I doubt itll be limited. People may wanna play with friends they make after classic has been out for a while. I don't have a problem with people transferring off if they earned a bad reputation. Maybe they learned their lesson. This guy did one bad thing and shattered his rep. Maybe he never did it again. Either way, server xfers are the low hanging fruit of money making for classic.
---
on my pserver the wife was the GM and the husband the Raid lead/ML. They were extremely fair and didn't prioritize each other. They had a guild first mentality. Not all b/gf-husband/wife combos are bad.
---
The problems are far bigger than mana. Locks have a debuff to make mage and lock damage bypass boss resists. There is no such spell for nature or gear to bypass it until much later on. When all that happens, THEN they run out of mana and still are bad.
---
In 5 mans they are fine. They are like a mage, they just have to drink a lot. If you want to get GOOD gear on a elemental shaman (and all the best stuff is in AQ) then you simply have to heal in raids. The rank 10 and warlord set sucks for elemental as well so that's not an option. It is for enhance. 
---
Really interesting quote, hadn't seen it before. Do you have a link to where this is from? Is there any more?
---
Any chance we can get these without the logo and / or with the logo in the corner? it's distracting to see it right in the middle of every image. otherwise these are amazing! nice job!

I think ‚Äúsemi-rare‚Äù mobs are about a 5hr respawn. ‚ÄúRare‚Äù in Vanilla was 12hr+. Not really sure though since it‚Äôs been a long time.

My oldest wow friend is a girl. Shes a pretty cool person to game with. She streams sometimes too. She said shes playing retail though. We have been FB friends for years so I can still be friends with her.

I was 19, just outta' school and living with a buddy about a block and a half away from my parents' place. We had a tire swing in the front yard and everything. Good times.

First character was a night elf hunter (female, naturally; gotta' have that cheesecake) on Shadow Council. At level 10 I ran her back to Shadowglen to tame a level 1 young nightsaber as her pet. Took him all the way to ~55 with her (taming others along the way to learn new skills to teach him, but Orion was always her #1).
---
Sadly never made it to 60 with her, as somewhere around late '05/early'06 I made some new friends who convinced me to reroll Horde on Kirin Tor and join their guild. That one didn't hit 60 until well after TBC dropped.
---
I'm nothing if not consistent.
---
No school and no other hobbies to speak of, really. After jumping ship from City of Heroes, WoW essentially *was* my life, at least until I stopped playing right about the time Wrath released. I worked at the local Smith's, played when I wasn't working and consumed entirely too much Doritos and Dew while doing so. I think I actually managed to get a girlfriend somewhere in there, though I've no idea how the hell I managed to keep her as long as I did.
---
Now I'm 33, working as a box chucker at a warehouse. Single, no kids, not much else going on beyond work and regular D&amp;D nights. 'Course, by the time Classic drops I'll have myself a shiny new motorcycle, so we'll see how often each of those wins out over the other.
---
I've always been a raging altoholic and have no plans of changing that. When Classic drops I'm going to have at least one character of every class, multiples of some, and all of 'em as can be will be tauren. GBMR, mother effer. My first/main-ish (emphasis on the "ish") will probably be a tauren druid. S/he'll probably also be a thunder chicken. Anyone who doesn't like that can eat my furry, feathered behind.
---
Darn, I didn't read that I was supposed to name major cities too lol. I was sitting there scratching my head as to why there were still so many locations missing. I got all but the major cities, Moonglade, and Alterac Mountains. I would have only had 2 left if I had noticed I had to name the cities too lol. Oh well. XD

A better way to do this would be through items that make progression possible with horizontally equivalent gear.

I.E. add an onyxia hide cloak equivalent to Naxx for the next raid.
---
why would anyone want to steal someone elses gamer tag. to steal their fame?
---
Nobody voted that they had gone to a private MOP or after server.
---
I'd NUT for an Enh rework, either make them tank or melee dps. It's kind of weird to see both present in one talent tree, so feral.
---
I hope that we do... just that they change the materials. I'm afraid people will stockpile the mats required making the event shorter than it once was. This is one of the few changes I advocate for. I honestly think it makes the game better. It gives everyone a chance to take part in the event.
---
Unfortunately that strategy doesn't work well. It's better to stack the usual damage stats and then downrank spells as necessary to make mana last through the fight. Elemental shaman can't come close to the raid DPS of a mage or warlock.
---
I know... just saying why would you play on those lol.
---
Same concept in mobas, "pff u need friends to kill me hahaha 1v1 me loser". ...... Its a team game, get friends. People who say fight fair are generally the ones waiting to stab u when u turn around. Or some RPing.

---
As a rogue I use Oto's rogue guide. 
---
Paladin seems really unpopular. I'll echo that. No interest in playing one. I love the class fantasy but I hate putting 5 minutes buffs on my OWN character every 5 minutes (shaman) so I couldn't imagine doing that a lot. 
---
Warrior is similar for me. I love the class fantasy of being an armored dude who hits dudes with a bigass axe while everyone else is using magic and shit. I just don't like the stance system at all.
---
I dont like fairly balanced games, when every character is balanced, no one has fun. Its about having matchups and knowing what you can beat an when to run. 
---
I have three boys now, and I've been thinking about making a similar post for months. I do like the idea of raiding, but it would have to be with like minded people. Maybe once every week at the most.
---
Huge agree for me. Yes, TBC was the beginning of all the changes, but I loved ths content. The one expansion I would go back to specifically just for the content. 
---
Probably when I decided to win the weekly STV fishing contest on my first attempt.  As I was getting close to the goal, I ran into the most notorious Horde ganker on the server, who was also fishing.  I managed to slip away from him, but my heart was pounding.
---
Also the all-out war between factions during the AQ events, particularly the Duskwood boss that would get stronger when he killed people.  The whole Alliance mounted a prolonged zerg attack to forestall the Horde from killing him.
---
The bigger problem I have is that some people would probably buy it. A fool and his money are soon parted I suppose.
---
Do you really not know of the golden promise that Paladin Leeroy Jenkins delivered unto us, all those years ago? Naming a paladin Leeroy is like naming a Muslim kid Mohammed.
---
Every new server launched between 1.9-2.0 had the opening, i dont see why it would be disabled.
---
I want to play the game as soon as I can. So I am for early access... I am for it because I know it won't be there. That's how I justify it to my no changes self. I 100% believe there will be no early access. If for some reason blizzard decided to change the way they do things then I would buy the early access. If they make some kind of deluxe version or even a box set ill buy that. Even without early access ill buy it. Again I don't think there will be early access.
---
No they haven't but why would they give early access for what is essentially the same thing as an xpac just without the new content? They haven't done it before and I doubt they do it now. 
---
I am not playing Alliance, but if I did I'd use it to cheese a duel, just to see the other person rage.
---
18, night elf huntard, senior year of high school
---
Yeah... I really love night elves even on my rogue. I have been considering going human in classic for the racials... plus that reputation buff is so nice. I still want to be a nelf though. Questing through Teldrassil and making the run to westfall... it won't be the same without doing those things. 
---
Well that only really affects pvp servers. I really hope Blizz will crackdown on things like cross faction collusion. There was a person on the classic forums trying to convince me that faction collusion was a good thing and shouldn't be a bannable offense. I figure people like that usually plan on gaming the system as much as possible.
---
And sometimes he gives you a shitty gray or white version instead.
---
Kresh is my homie. I remember taming him for Shell Shield or whatever it was called.
---
BfA was merely a setback... -Jaina probably.
---
I guess we have different philosophies, you assume a GM runs the entire show instead of delegating responsibility.
---
Unfortunately theres not enough room for all the would be bakers in the world, since you still need all the other things that allow you to bake to begin with.
---
I hate data mining... thats why the game holds no mystery anymore. Everyone knows everything before it launches. bosses die within days of being available. I miss the days of 6 months to kill Ragnaros. I know he was the first so there was a lot more like just learning how raiding worked and all that but plenty of other bosses took a month or two to kill. I miss that. 
---
‚ÄúThat's idealistic. Retail doesn't feel like "one big community" when they merged my realms.‚Äù
---
First off, how is talking about how retail feels have anything to do with Classic? I actually played on a medium/low-pop server back then and when there was a server merge it was amazing. Suddenly you had new guilds and faces and it felt alive again. Id rather have an authentic launch of a server and MAYBE have a population issue later that can be addressed, over a Blizzard experiment mashup server...
---
Yes it will be tied to the retail subscription, but lets be honest most of the people that will ‚ÄúJust try it out‚Äù will be gone before lvl 20. Just like people first trying it out back then. Thats not going to result in a server suddenly dying, thats not even going to result in more than a 30% loss tops. Think about how many private servers there are, big and small around the globe. Think about the people that are coming back only for Classic because of their love of the game in that state.  These are dedicated players, players that im sure will be able to keep their limited number of regional servers with a healthy player base. Adding to this, how many redundant servers do you think Blizz will make per time zone? You dont think they‚Äôre going to make the smallest of amount of servers possible to save money on a game they arent even selling? Your servers will be fine.
---
‚ÄúLife isn't simple.‚Äù
---
No but as everyone likes to point out, 14 year old games are. 
---
That's pretty lame. Even for "random internet'ness." Have my down vote.
---
I thought this was about the turtle in Tanaris thats slow as hell that you escort across the entire zone to his wife on the coast of the water.
---
Wow, that‚Äôs one amazing friend you had!
---
I think there is a sizeable amount of people who want vanilla just like it was or as close to it as possible who remain silent. I know there are a lot of no changes posts but, at least on the classic forum, it seems to be a lot more of people asking for changes and the no changers trying to explain why those changes are a bad idea. 
---
And the consequences are pretty harsh if you get caught.
---
Warrior, for reasons
---
Definitely herbalism and alchemy!  Those two professions will always be incredibly useful, and not only for gold making.
---
If you're keen on role playing or having a **shield spike**, the alternative might be worth considering.  You can always roll an herb/ alchemist Druid alt or pick the professions up after you're done leveling.  Having those health potions as a Warrior will make your life a whole lot easier on the way to 60, though!
---
As a hunter yeah. Patches were pretty decent for us in classic, lol.  The only negative ones were like... "Oh hey! Your unique pet that you found with its .... special traits? Yeah hes normalized now."
---
THOSE were a drag. Were some awesome pets with high resists, elemental damage and more. Such great stuff.
---
Really appreciate this, thanks man! :)
---
Its the vocal minority who are always the loudest and get the most attention. I usually skip those obvious posts.
---
Great take on Cata there. They tried something new, it didn't always work out, but it did make me pine for vanilla again. I was so excited to go back to old, not flooded 1K Needles again. 
---
In a vacuum the vanilla world is so much better. But compared to all the other expansions the vanilla world looked super incogruous and functioned badly. It did need an update. It wasn't a perfect update or expansion but for players who had played for years it was nice to meaningfully explore the main two continents again.
---
Also Cata added Goblins and Worgen, two of my favorite races (ones I've actually been waiting since vanilla to play. Goblin shaman was amazing. Dwarf shaman is also amazing if only from a lore perspective (it makes SO much sense).
---
Ah the blue post on classic forums last month was confirming that Honor Ranks will be in at launch. Guess that means WPvP at TM SS like you mentioned.
---
Athena for me
---
Look harder. 
---
Wow.. that must have sucked. Total waste of a convincing sick act, lol. 
---
Well they didn't 100% confirm either of them. I know what you are going to say though...   
---
I do not want sharding at. all. I will still play with it in starting areas though. I hate to have to do it but I will still play. Loot trading again was just being looked at as an option. Until they come out and 100% confirm them there is still a chance.
---
Yep, also many many many small shallow bodies of water in Swamp of Sorrows dismount Gnomes (as they go into swim animation) but don't do the same for ANY other race (not even dwarves, I checked).
---
Its EXTREMELY annoying. Its slows gnomes down while literally all other races can stay mounted or run, meanwhile the shorty gnomes swim/dismount in puddles. I hate it.

---
These are absolutely stunning, thank you for making them! The Ironforge one is now the wallpaper on my Mac.

Not to derail, but has anyone stumbled across any good phone-sized WoW classic wallpapers?
---
He still knows more than we do... just because he was laid off doesn't mean he just forgot everything. I don't see why he would lie. That could destroy his reputation. I don't necessarily expect news from him but I welcome anything he is willing to talk about.
---
Suprisingly, it took place in BC for me.
---
My GM was doing Ring of Blood on an alt with another guildie and a 70. They got ganked in the middle of the event by 2 70s. The GM went on his 70 to kill them so they could do the event 1 at a time. 2 more horde came to back them up, 2 of our guildies and a random PuG joined to fight them off. They fought for about 10 mins before the horde retreated to Halaa. The GM asked for help in guild, bringing our numbers to about 10. This is where I joined.
---
We took Halaa, but the Horde brought their numbers to about 20, i took over recruiting and got everyone in guild and spammed Nagrand chat for help, our numbers swelled past 30 and we retook Halaa. The ping pong match continued, i estimated theyhad over 50 at that point. 
---
I told everyone in raid to get their guilds to nagrand and our guildies to get anyone they knew. I dropped raid to fill a second raid to about 70 and we retook Halaa. The horde countered with nearly 80 and once again took the city.
---
The battles were about even for a few rounds, but the horde were starting gain more numbers. At this point so I had to go to Shatt to spam trade for more men. I managed to get the third raid up to about 100 and returned to the battle. It was a lowpop server and there was literally almost no one left on the server who wasnt in  the dungeon that could get to Nagrand left.
---
We briefly overpowered them with our 100 men, but the Horde just had more numbers, in their last attack, we were completely overwhelmed by what i estimated to be 120-160 men. We got completely wiped, we couldnt even regroup outside Halaa, they had enough men to break us before we could form up.
---
The whole event went from 100 man raid to breaking apart in a period of about 5 mins. It was an amazing impromptu world PvP event,  i got over 200 battle tokens even though i was recruiting for a good portion of it. One of my guildies got over 400. 
---
Blackskull Shield on my paladin, had a mini heart attack I begged my group members for it. Luckily nobody else could wield shields so everyone was cool with me taking it.
---
GOD DAMN I CANT WAIT FOR CLASSIC I WANT IT RIGHT NOW
---
Amazing job dude!
---
Agreed. I think it could be catastrophic if they delay it. They already gave themselves a buffer by not giving a firm date but a few months in which to pick a date.
---
Tier 11 may be the best dungeon and raid situation the game ever had. 
---
Granted, the Shattering destroyed the world I had come to love. But those early heroic dungeons were premium content and I didn't hate raiding pre-LFR either.
---
I'm going to have to go rogue as well. It was my first 60+ class in BC and I like being useful to a group in some way and besides sap rogue doesn't bring a whole lot as far as utility.
---
For PvP, engineering for sure.
---
Pick up mining and skinning early on and then drop them for engineering and tailoring (or whatever) once you have all the mats you want or have reached 60.  Save the materials you need to power level engineering, and bank your cloth until you swap.
---
For ganking lowbies, though, you should definitely see the psychology trainer.
---
&gt; Along with making things too easy it also hurts crafting.
---
This is something not a lot of people mention.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure mine was Hand of William the Odd? Something like that. Level 50-ish, chance to restore mana on spellcast, I think. 
---
I hate those people. They give progression raiders a bad name. Personally, I enjoy teaching new players in low level dungeons. Maybe that one thing they didn't know about their role/class is the gap between being ok and being great. Maybe they weren't liking their class and was thinking about re rolling but you clued them in on the one thing that makes a world of difference. People will be more willing to listen to you if you try to teach them or help them and not yell at them. people will remember you from lower level content and be more willing to work with you  down the road. Your reputation in early levels matters just as much at max level. More so in vanilla because it takes a lot longer to be max level than in retail.
---
Me too, man. Every other person here either works in IT or is an engineer. I‚Äôm not in a great situation myself so I can definitely relate to you. Also looking forward to Classic! Hopefully it brings a lot of happiness to our lives. :)
---
I thought it was the one in BfD with the belt. 
---
Why would you ever tell your boss you aren't coming in for WoW? I'm not saying you should call in or not show up for wow... just that if I were to do that WoW wouldn't even come up. Id make something up that doesn't even require a doctors note. Sorry sir... I ate some bad fish last night and I can't be outside of 5 yards from my bathroom. 
---
same.
---
Yeah as much as I want the human rep racial and the very slight dps increase from sword skill I just love night elves too much. In my experience you can overcome the racial dps increase with skill. That rep bonus is soooooo enticing though. Ohh well. I've done rep grinds and nelf every time. One more time won't hurt.
---
I just tested this on the pserver I sue for testing. At least on that server, I can say this does work
---
no idea. I just can't not be the best. being less efficient is a pet peeve of mine. Being the best around is fun to me. 
---
Run speed enchant is supposed to stack. Does on private servers and mentioned in old forum posts from retail.
---
Does it have to be level 21? Not that a twink 21 Druid wouldn't still wreck most fresh Redridge prey, it's pretty gimp until Furor and Feral Charge can both be taken (assuming a pure physical stat feral Twink). 2 Twink Rogues at 21 would be a more complete team.
---
Feral starts to get pretty sweet closer to 27. Obviously 40 is pretty special for them, as feral is basically concept complete. Each level after is just sexiness. 
---
First time he enters at level 30/31 which is what level the OP refers to in his question, there is no turn-in. There are quests on later visits at mid 30s (such as Goblin Sponsorship). 
---
All these years I thought Leeroy was a warrior. I just watched it again and saw the DS. 
---
*Laughs in Paladin*
---
Had a friend "Lerroy" lmao
---
friend. Finished it for you
---
You will on Classic. Druid has a very high skill ceiling and people have had a decade to perfect it. 
---
Good Lord man ... you seriously know nothing about them.
---
Haha oh man, Puma! Those were good days, little bit of nostalgia seeing all those names
---
Haha I knew we were horde first! Some guy in here saying otherwise, but I didn't wanna argue cause I wasn't 100% sure. Good seeing you, I remember that silly mace haha, good times!
---
The more spirit you have the better the spirit stat gets, so I advise you try to maximize spirit and skip +mps if you try this, even still it'd be tough to last with only 15%.
---
You could try a spec like: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEcuV0MaZEbbbLM
---
For some extra raid usefulness.
---
When you're running up to replace totems you can hopefully stop casting long enough to get a tick or two of the real spirit from your gear.
---
Yes! Thank you! Time to build a Win10 theme around these. 
---
&gt;	sharding could ruin everything if it‚Äôs permanent
---
If they do this thing they acknowledged was completely antithetical to the game and said they had no plans on doing they could ruin everything!
---
Warrior. The only class I‚Äôve never played seriously in any capacity. Warlock is second least played. 
---
I think experience wise is probably Druid &gt; Priest &gt; Paladin &gt; Hunter. Classes I‚Äôve played the most. 
---
Druid mains, rise up
---
Hey Man, we had the guy during the guns of north watch questline and the MC port.
---
Yea so wait a few hours or sleuth the server based on all the people you see on stream
---
Maybe if you‚Äôre at 1%..
---
Yeah.  Actually, you know what, I shouldn't even leave the door open to that in my own comment.  I just don't want some people to think I'm ignoring their idea that Barrens and Westfall are "starter zones."
---
But anyway, while it does always baffle me exactly *how* information gets distorted, by now I've seen it happen a lot when people are heavily biased one way or another; in this case, in thinking everything implemented in WoW since Cataclysm is wholly game-breaking and destructive.
---
I imagine the battlemasters will be in the cities. 
---
TBH I expect them to announce the server they are on... but maybe the amount of follower can make it harder to get quest mobs. That's why I think they may consider hiding it to start. It lets them get ahead of their followers a bit so they don't have to fight over quest mobs with everyone in the zone.
---
I've never used mine on any toon. I'm not playing Alliance in Classic so no need to worry.
---
One of the problems with this strategy is that you have to sacrifice two of the three armor slots that have the full itemization budget. Chest and leg slots are too valuable to give away on an item with no dps stats. 
---
Assuming you're trying to compete with other casters: bloodvine pants and vest grant 64 spell damage, 3% spell hit, and 2% spell crit for that set bonus, and add on whatever pair of gloves you like. You'd be sacrificing boat loads of stats for a type of set bonus that would be similar to a baseline ability (life tap) or 3 talent points (frost channeling) for another class.
---
In addition to that, you'd probably have to start stacking spirit on the rest of your gear in order to take advantage of the set bonus, further hamstringing dps stats. Gear that is traditionally thought of as good ele gear isn't going to have much, if any, spirit.
---
These were my first two as well, but i sold the pauldrons :(
---
There are dozens of us! My big downer currently is that I work nightshift, while my few gaming friends are all dayshift. So I'll be a bit lonely playing during the early afternoons.
---
I mean we got dragons to kill right? who cares bout pvp!
---
Nothing quite like going to Nesingwary's, seeing a whole bunch of skeletons and knowing you were going to add to the pile... one way or another.
---
Zug Zug!
---
If you say it a third time your wiener will fall off. 
---
I enjoy the questlines.
---
Oof that new Darkshire music too
---
*Darkshiregasms*
---
Many people, myself included, have mentioned that there's no way they go full circle.  Best case (i.e. furthest they would go) for a Classic+ progression system would be up to WOTLK.  
---
Reasons are:
---
1) WOTLK Was the peak of their *concurrent* subscription base.
---
2) WOTLK Was the culmination of the popular Arthas storyline.
---
3) The expansion after WOTLK was cataclysm that required them "reworking" Azeroth.  In short, Vanilla+TBC+WOTLK represents a pure mostly unaltered Azeroth with new continents thrown in for storytelling purposes.  It also represents (mostly) the pinnacle of raiding and viability of specs as both TBC and WOTLK improved specs to the point that they allowed people to play the spec they wanted, without feeling pigeonholed by efficacy of other specs.
---
or you just do what 90% of people do on Private servers and just say you are reserving the mount and paying 200g to the person who rolls the highest, you don't ruin your rep and you get a lot of peasants begging to come to your run at a chance at chump change.
---
In 2005 I was 16 and my high school gf had just dumped me, I was a wreck and WoW was there to comfort me, haha. I played a human warrior, I remember going to MC as arms and being totally useless. Eventually I became a decent 2nd or 3rd OT in my guild and we cleared BWL, never really made any progress in AQ. I quit during TBC, college was more interesting.
---
Today I live in Hong Kong, am married (no kids) and have a pretty intense/high-pressure career. I still found time to level a dwarf priest to 60 over the last six months north of dale, and have had a great time. Joined a good guild and we cleared AQ40, I have most of my T2 and Bene by now.
---
In Classic, looking forward to recreating my dwarf priest with the same guild I‚Äôm in now, and clearing Naxx. We may or may not get it done north of dale but I‚Äôm sure we will in Classic.
---
The big difference now is time. I can only play ~8 hours a week, and for those 8 hours WoW is a great release from the pressure of my job. I look forward to it, without it taking over my life. I also maximize my time in game, usually raiding or helping guildies, no time to run around aimlessly, pvp, or be bored like I could when I was younger.
---
Why would a warrior need shoulders to heal?
---
The reality of that idea is that there will just effectively be a new soft level cap at say 63 or so that almost everyone will be expected to eventually achieve and only complete no-lifers will ever get past and only ever by one level. Either that or the level curve isn't exponential enough and it just completely breaks the game as some players level way ahead of the old 'max' level.
---
&gt;Not all b/gf-husband/wife combos are bad.
---
Of course not. Your experience is the exception, not the rule.
---
I sincerely all of us willing can be a part of a cooperative, functional guild.
---
100% at 2min to spare, I really like the old zones.
---
won't matter, servers will be packed and sharding will basically make all starting experiences the same regardless of how full or empty servers are :)
---
I'm in a Naxx progressed hardcore guild. We still wipe 10 fucking times in Scholo because no one's nuking the damn ghosts.
---
I run dungeons and ZG with all the big guilds on the server, still people fuck up, pull mobs in ZG, don't kill the Eye of Naxx in Strat UD, etc.
---
It's still a hard game. People act like they're gonna have 40 people at the raid, on time, everyone the right build and itemization, world buffs, consumes, knowing exactly how to pull and all class roles in the raid, etc.
---
This is simply not going to happen.
---
Not worth it.  You'd be better off using Tier 1 gear and assuming it's out, just farming/buying all the cards for the Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon trinket.  
---
When I played during vanilla my optimal gear that started to let me compete with other caster dps, was the ZG set.  
---
ZG set, full raid buffs, flask of distilled wisdom, Dark Runes, Demonic Runes, and of course Mana Potions and you'll put out half-decent numbers.
---
Yes but that quest is cancer. Almost impossible to do. 
---
Worgen and Goblins are getting a model update in 8.2 too!!! But yea, the point about a vacuum is very important. Nowadays when I level, 60-80 is the like trudging through a humid swamp. It's gotten stale when you know how much better every other level is, I've done them too many times.
---
I never said it was the rule! Can't people just say their experiences anymore without everyone thinking they are saying thats how it was for everyone!? TIL if you have a different experience and share with the group then everyone assumes you are saying thats how it was for everyone. sigh.
---
Leave totem twisting for the melee group to the dedicated Nightfall/Enhancement shaman.  Resto or Elemental shaman have either GCD issues, or mana issues respectively that totem twisting is just not worth it.
---
I don't have that BiS list handy. I'd appreciate a link if you've got it.
---
Often times what you can do is look at the DM stage of these pserver BiS lists to get an idea, but even that isn't fool proof, because absolutely nobody here knows exactly which items will be available at release.
---
Even though Strat, Scholo, and so on were available on release, greens and rares were added at different patches. When will they be added? All available on release? We simply don't know. 
---
Still a good starting point, but you may go farming for a BiS item only to find it's not even in the loot tables, or a far better item is in the loot tables but wasn't listen in the BiS list.
---
Rogue is amazing in wpvp but I just find it so boring in pve. The constant numbers are a lot less impressive than HUEG CRITS which as a rogue you only get with either ambush (pvp mostly) or with 5 point eviscerates. And eviscerate only become good later in the game with the book for it, and when you have enough crit to play seal fate. Just don't find the general damage dealing style fun, at least with tbc affliction warlocks you feel like a real warlock cursing people all the time. With rogues doing dps you have to do your exact rotation perfectly or your dps goes into the trash. 
---
At least with mages you have fire or arcane/frost spec which causes huge spikes in damage, really satisfying. My all time favorite is 2h warrior dps though, arms or fury doesn't matter. 
---
There is actually a whole community of people out there focused on claiming names in games. For games that have expiration dates for unused characters, they set up bots to monitor and automatically capture names as soon as they expire. It got really bad in Path of Exile and the devs straight up started banning people and releasing names. 
---
the database is from the original wow good god im done... Go back to casual BFA holy shit...
---
Have the entire sign up and character creation bound to an autohotkey macro like the pros do it 
---
I spent way too long trying to wipe away that speck above the first e on my phone screen then I should care to admit. 
---
I've said in another post, I'll repeat here. I'm in a Naxx progressed hardcore guild on a pserver and also run PUGs with the few other hardcore guilds on there, dungeons and ZG/AQ40 etc.
---
Some people are still clueless. They still wipe in Scholo for not nuking the ghost. Tanks still don't know how to pull the mana elementals in DM:W. People still can't kill the fishing boss in ZG, or they pull mobs while travelling.
---
It's easy for people to sit in their armchair and look at a couple of guides and think everything is figured out. It's just my lived experience that even the most hardcore of hardcore players still have a lot of noobs among them and still fuck up regularly.
---
So take the retail crowd coming in... it's going to be a clusterfuck. People are really going to be surprised by it. I'm pretty confident in this estimation.
---
People are going to be banging their head against MC for a while. Hell, it'll be hard enough to get 40 people in the same place at the same time.
---
Yes there will be hardcore guilds that will clear MC in the first week. But will every server have a guild like that? Will even the top 3 guilds be like that? How much does it mean if there's just a single guild on a server like that?
---
It's going to be far more noob than people give credit for. In a way the false sense of ease that retail players will have can even make more farces possible.
---
I was on Thunderlord - Hunter / Shess / Kokujin

---
They really should, I'd prefer to roll on a server with the most international players as opposed to a server dominated by one nationality.
---
\+1.  Finally someone with some common sense.  Everyone on here is like "My 1337 pserver guild is gonna be super bleeding edge min-max when Classic Launches!"  Yea....sure I'll believe that every single person in the 40 man guild plays every single trash mob, boss pull, and knows their class that well...
---
I put the link in a different comment. I plan on rolling with my pserver bis list for now and making changes accordingly. I'll be a rogue though. We have less issues with things like proc rates on items that pservers get wrong  for classes like warriors and ironfoe.
---
See yourself out.
---
This is true. Also the reason we haven't had classic for 15 years.
---
The leveling is too fast. WPVP is the only thing stopping it feeling like most content is at 60, but truly, most content IS at 60.  
---
This isnt blizzards fault but the players tendency to want to hit 60 as soon as possible. I feel like this wouldnt be as big an issue on RP servers.
---
TIme's up chums
---
The variations of Legolas over the years is astounding 
---
This will.be the official first item shop for classic: reserve name on server pre-launch.
---
Everyone dies absurdly easy to pet classes. Bestial Wrath is one-button kill basically.
---
Thats not annoying though, its part of the class fantasy.
---
Can you teach me how to do this, please?
---
I saw it now. And saved! Really like that consumes list.
---
I'm not an expert in druids so I can't say much about the list. I see it's not separated into patches. The lists do go down very, very far though. More than most lists. That helps because you can just work your way down the list until you get to an available item.
---
Fair point, never played a Shaman so I wouldn't know. Didn't really consider that they might be expensive on mana.
---
That was my point.
---
We weren't on an RP server but there was always this all Alliance defense Dwarf RP guild that we always ran up against in wPVP, just incidentally. My guild lead an ill-fated (and undermanned) attack on Ironforge and the dwarves were not having it. They repelled us and then chased us up and around the mountains. We came back a week later and taunted them from the top of the Ironforge gate until they sent a contingent out to deal with us. From then on we'd run into them all the time in Blackrock and other places. When me and a buddy came across a member of that guild in the wild, we didn't kill him, we all saluted each other and went our separate ways and then met them blade to blade at the back gates of Orgrimmar with our guilds the next day. I loved the friendly rivalry we had even though I was never sure if they quite remembered our guild.
---
With an organized and skilled guild raiding max shouldn't be impossible. If you're not hardcore like having all consumes all the time and getting all raid buffs, Nax will be doable if there are no changes to difficulty. 
---
People need to be smart from the get go and start farming mats for future raid. When classic launches and your a dad or mum and you know you wanna do AQ40 and Nax - you need to start prepping on day 1of level 60. By the time content is released you'll have mats for consumes and BiS farmed out.
---
Lol well put.
---
Did they really say "completely antithetical?" Seems like a distant shore from considering it wholesale only a little while ago.
---
Only 3k? I feel like I remember getting globaled on my priest with \~6k hp self-buffed by a geared hunter just before AQ (if he crit all 3 shots). I definitely don't remember losing to hunters very often though, so it was a rarity.
---
That was a long time ago though, and I could be misremembering
---
Or they could just, you know, like, actually make the specs worth a damn in raids?  
---
  
---
Most hybrid DPS just need Mana Regen...   
---
There's only a few spells/buffs/debuffs that need to be tweaked to make some specs more optimal/viable/whatever you want to call it
---
Fucking A right?
---
Old Gods are breaking through trying to destroy Azeroth, we've got bigger shit to deal with than Orc refugees vs 'sorry our asshole ex prince poisoned you'
---
That's weird, it sounds like your implying most guilds don't host an exclusive guild Classic WoW server designed to eliminate gear and consumable farming, allowing members to practice raid mechanics with unlimited resets for the guild of 80 hardcore raiders... 
---
Play more private servers, noob
---
This is why I'm rolling Shaman
---
I remember premades snowballing pugs away from the portals lol
---
I really love the atmosphere of Shadowmoon in Draenor 
---
"We understand, and I understand completely, that sharding is antithetical to a cohesive Classic community." -Ion, Blizzcon 2018
---
I'm pretty sure it's a specialty world PvP set. Good for mafia work or large scale PvP battles, keeps you fueled up without drinking.
---
I'm farming green Dragonscale set to carry me to early pre-raid bis. Basically I want to farm the mats while leveling and be able to equip it by 53-55 when I respec @ 55/56 for more elemental/healing spec.  
---
I don't have much shaman experience, but I think the green Dragonscale set is only useful for early dungeons / MC until you replace it with decent gear. 
---
With 200-220 spirit it only comes to 23 mp5 while casting. So really it's not too hot but still worth a damn pre-60
---
I remember before mop came out I saved a few monk themed names ... 
---
Still have Brewmaster Brewz which I love ... not even clever or anything, I just love it lol
---
You are better off down ranking LB, using pots and consumes. 
---
Don't we all?
---
Shaman, druid, paladin and maybe rogue crew.
---
Solaire would be my Paladin name. 
---
You are the type of person that ganks levelers in stv on your 60 arnt you?
---
He's got the spaulders of valor on. Not Lightforge.
---
https://youtu.be/mLyOj_QD4a4
---
No 
---
I dunno man. It's good but. We got people ate servers which are pretty damn good. 
---
\&gt; Some quests eliminate a breadcrumb or make you ineligible for the breadcrumb when you complete the quest. So if you don't do the quest first, you can squeeze a little more XP out of the effort.   
---
No.
---
Best post tbqh
---
MAGA
---
How do you even sell a name as soon as you make an advertisement saying "Selling Leeroy character name on Darkspear" you immediately will get investigated/banned.
---
oh, this again.
---
I will make to gank any paladin named leeroy, no doubt
---
No changes, of course. Why would I go through all of the trouble on leveling toons on a vintage Vanilla server only to then open the door for Blizzard to start mucking it up?
---
Raiding with kids is entirely feasible you just have to make sure you schedule time for yourself to play.  Not only have I raided with kids for years, I've also led a raiding guild while raising children.  (Both Mythic level in retail, and end game progression on private servers).
---
My wife raids too, so it's not like she's just taking care of the kids. We try to raid after the kids go to bed were interruptions should not happen the kids going to school also gives another time to play. Worst case scenario you could hire a babysitter on raiding days.
---
Bottom line though is that kids make things tougher but not impossible to.  Healthy Boundaries for your kids should be in place regardless of wow, so it shouldn't be impossible to have time for hobbies you care about
---
Mage/Paladin/Warrior.
---
While I find every other class to have something fun, this 3 ain't my thing. For ~13y I have played mage and paladins only once, as alts. 
---
Mage - while there seems to be a lot of skills, I found most of them too niche. And his spells are a bit powerful with a lot of CC and it is seems to me like cheating. Also, blink bugs!
---
Paladin - never been a fan, while recbombninja is a thing in some very meme video, I still don't find them interesting. Not good enough to be dpsers, not good enough to be tankers, you are just the guy with the imba buffs.
---
Warrior - hard for leveling and it is hard to find a group as dps. Too gear dependant. Again - charge bugs. I don't want to spam sunder for the rest of the game.
---
Well it was part of the program my old Logitech g15 keyboard came with.
---
But as far as I know any keyboard with g keys would have this. And you basically just make a keystroke macro.
---
Save it so I can use it on the BFA realms in 15 years
---
So, it's unoriginal and overused? 
---
If you're trying to say something, how about you clearly state your opinion instead of being sarcastic about it?  I'm willing to accept opposing views on the subject (even if I dont necessarily agree with them) but not if you're going to be purposefully vague and snarky about it.
---
And assuming I understand that hell of a run-on  sentance you posted: the answer is no.  PServer experience =/= Live experience.  And to follow that up: if you think the microsm that are these reddit forums in any way represents the entirety of the future population of Classic WoW...you're in for a rude awakening bub.
---
I'm not a parent but wouldn't mind joining a parent guild. Seems casual and I don't mind stopping in the middle of a dungeon. 
---
I mostly pvp on my own and just like being in a guild for the chat feature/ occasion 5man/ fun raid.
---
It's nerfed on the pserver now. I was netting 30-50g an hour depending on luck.
---
You won't have trouble finding groups as any class or spec in Classic. There are always groups doing all kinds of runs. All DM wings, tributes, Strat orb runs, live/zerg, scholo zerg, UBRS is 15 man etc etc.
---
Always people in need of any class/spec
---
When I get back from work I will post an Imgur album as reply to this comment and in the video description.
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
Is this really possible? 
---
:) bloody auto correct on phone hahaha
---
For someone who plays so much wow he seems really uninformed.
---
I think he means meld before your opponent even casts the first spell. Which should be possible.
---
But I can't remember if you enter combat immediately after someone starts casting on you, or if the spell has to land first. 
---
But, it's still the same. You still get ganked to shit endgame. You have alliance raids camping all the FPs killing every Horde that land, etc.

---
Alamo, no!
---
Not really tho cause you typically bring more mages than rogues and warriors. 
---
Shaman is all about burst, in both specs. Enhancement is an RNG fiesta where you randomly one-shot anyone, and ele is just a lightning cannon going around waiting for cooldowns.
---
No, you're not going to win 1v1 against a rogue who knows what he's doing. But it will rely on him getting the first blow. A rogue caught out of stealth is often a dead rogue. 
---
That second last paragraph is brutal, seems to imply there could be sharding but only one boss mob or vein... Really is crap communication... the guy talking a foreigner something?
---
If they wanted to be clear they'd say:
---
"We plan to only ever use sharding in the first zones and only for a certain number of hours after launch."
---
Seems like there's room for something else in what he said.
---
I was gonna say, I'm pretty surprised by how little he seems to know about classic. Most of what he said he's worried about happening haven't been worried about by even the most neurotic classic fan.
---
A mix of Shaman and Mage. Shaman because Horde (otherwise I'd main one) and Mage is weird for me. On paper, I like what a Mage can do and I love combining fire and ice. But for the life of me I can't seem to have FUN with Mage. Really not sure why that is.
---
Just get an addon. Holy shit dicks, how hard was that? 20 seconds?
---
I don't think a warlock has come close to 1st 60 on any server except Nost (bugged beastslaying applying to spells). 
---
I couldn't even watch 1/4 of it. Boring as shit
---
That.. might be the stupidest analogy i've seen so far.         
---
Just compare it to a lottery like a normal person.
---
Sell the names 
---
That's why it's a spec for later in the game when you have the gear to support it. 
---
Its exaggerated. But what he doesnt tell you is the bonus food and drinks made that other guys cholesterol rise, plus got dabetas. And he fat and may not live past 50 due to heart disease.
---
Didn't get my first epic until Karazhan bwahaha, it was always dungeon set 1 because I was a naive kid who just wanted to run raids with the big guys. Emerald ripper was my first purple, still got it in my bank. 
---
The mage review was pretty damn top. Instant arcane explosion without talents. Shatter applying to all types of damage opening up elemental builds.
---
Shaman shared that patch review...and that didn't go so well.
---
Yep. I remember one popping up as a giant treant in Azshara. Don‚Äôt remember the context behind it but everyone was losing their minds.
---
Drama was always the vanilla wow guild killer.
---
It will suck but my suggestion is to become as anti-fragile as possible, ie become invaluable as early as possible: get the gear, learn the strats and even better if you know some rare recipes for raid consumables etc &amp; then you can just treat the drama as part of the theme park ride because you know you'll land on your feet in another guild.
---
I would also expect the drama to massively ramp if your guild every tries to start raiding Naxx.
---
**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, if you do something **stupid,** you will get **flamed.** But, leave our mothers out of it. Or not. Oh yeah, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the Molten Core mechanics. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Let's get it**
---
That's probably closer to the sound. It's been a while. 
---
Swtify WHO? 
---
Looking forward to crab pet for pin. Helps but doesn't alleviate it for too long
---
I've always wanted a druid. But I'm so scared because every post i read is polar opposite of each other
---
I love warrior! I like leading and having people rely on me to not be a moron!
---
Oh Sam what a burn. Obviously this guys past the age of 12. Probably mid teens.
---
Arthas
---
Bad bot
---
Hunter is king for world pvp. Lock can generally do well but starting back up after a death is a hassle. The stealth of a rogue is a huge help for survivability. 
---
I am tempted to argue that I shouldn't value his opinion because he is playing current wow which shows a clear lack of taste and judgement.
---
You'll see a ton of warriors but not nearly as many will get to level 60 
---
I hope so. But who knows? 
---
You should look into an mmo mouse. I use the Logitech g600 and couldn't play without it. 
---
Hunter. The thought of taking care of my pet all the time is not appealing.
---
I have that in real life. 
---
Shamens. I think chain heal is super cool, but the totems.... 
---
What I've always heard is that you'll enjoy hunter much more until end game then you'll wish you rolled a lock. Locks also look way better imo 
---
I'm going human warlock, hopefully less undeads than on private servers. 
---
Don't level as holy mate. You take 5 points in disc for the 25% increase to wand damage and then go shadow. Just keep some high int gear and you'll be able to heal/dps dungeons just fine. Then you can respec holy/disc close to 60.
---
Job hurting juice
---
its not too bad as a ranged class but i can see how it would be pure aids as melee. It's annoying forsure 
---
Lok‚Äôtar fuckin Ogar boys
---
**&lt;Paradox&gt;** is now officially recruiting any and all players!  Did you never get a chance to play back in the good ol days of vanilla and wondering what all of the hype is about, or simply returning to your roots and riding that nostalgia train home?  No matter what background or skill level you have with the game, we are always looking for those of you who are down to explore, level, raid, grind, and overall play the game and have a good time doing it!
---
This will be a **NA Horde** guild on a **Normal** server.  This will be an overall casual guild whose main focus is helping and supporting each other as we delve back into Classic WoW.  Again, as said above, ALL ARE WELCOME, let's have a good time together :)  PM me for more info, or if interested in joining once the servers go live!
---
What is this? classic wow is still a thing? 
---
Normal server for normies
---
Obsidian Edged Blade
---
Sick graphics, lame dps
---
I know, right? If an adult is unfortunate enough to eat at McDonalds, who then orders McNuggets for themself?
---
These are great, cheers!
---
Any chance we can get them in 1920x1080 like your starter zones pack?
---
Than*
---
Fighting underwater in melee is always been a bit of a pain in the ass, but I loved the zone too. 
---
Zip lines can fix everything.
---
I‚Äôm trying to decide between Shaman or Druid.
---
My main focus will be raiding. Druid bear sounds really fun but from what I hear that doesn‚Äôt happen often in raids. Resto Druid sounds boring so I‚Äôd rather just resto shaman if I‚Äôm gonna heal.
---
Thanks for the advice, as nerdy as it sounds I want a class with a high skill cap since I'll probably be playing PvP a lot, and from what people say it looks like the only "real" classes in PvP are Warrior, Rogue, Mage. 
---
With AHK anything is possible. It's not just hotkeys, you could create a whole helper app to do this.
---
Yes.
---
I just want the 4 nugget thing, I‚Äôm trying to watch my calorie intake. 
---
Now if you could take a Coca-Cola and just go half Coca-Cola, half Diet-Coke cause' I'm trying to watch my figure. Tryin' to loose some of the weight

Dude, just go with Coke Zero.
---
I will die of alcohol poisoning at this rate. 
---
There is a new spec that has been crafted on Pservers that uses downranked Regrowth and the 50% crit talents. With Ony it's 60% crit before stats are factored with 5 piece t2 your regrowth casts get down to 1.3 seconds making them faster than flash heals. It's more mana intense than moonglow but if you have the gear and consums it's the highest hps spec. 
---
Yep. In death I will become more powerful than you can imagine. Ok 60 rogue powerful. But I will stalk you to the ends of the earth
---
Wasn't Leeroy a warrior?
---
No zones to add really, I think all the ones added post-vanilla felt right with BC. Grizzly Hills is sweet though, i'll agree.
---
Grim Batol though... I always remembered seeing that giant area of the map in Wetlands where I couldn't go because even a whelpling could 1-shot me at ??. It was so mysterious and had it's own winding canyon path leading up to the entrance, where... well, nothing until Cataclysm, and then it was a shitty 5 man.
---
It just had such a level of mystique and power and *inaccessibility* to it that always made me want to discover what was inside. And a 40 minute (later 10 minute) long 5-man with vehicle mechanics and 80% of the surrounding area being background art like a Diablo 3 level. 
---
That's amazing! Thank you! 
---
I'm pretty sure I hated Grizzly Hills when I leveled my handful of toons to 80 back in Wrath. As I've gotten older it's been one of my favorite zones, i'm sure mostly because of the goddamn music.
---
Warlock. 
---
I love all the classes but warlocks seem to be the most reliant on multitasking plus I'm a melee guy first and foremost.
---
Activision, the real Lich King
---
I've seen this idea floated alot, and maybe in some really tweaked out way, it could work.
---
But it would rub me the wrong way using Molten Core gear to blast through Karazhan like it was made of paper, or essentially make every quest easy-mode even all the way through to Netherstorm or Shadowmoon.
---
I think they stated pretty clear that they are going to use both of it, not just considering options.
---
Oh man, I totally forgot how many people are going to rush to get all the original names. Some more stress to worry about it...
---
Plus the desolate sci-fi space feel of the dungeons and the world as a whole... The gameplay of TBC PVE was top-notch, but the entire aesthetic was beautiful to me, even if some people hate it.
---
Remember how its neck extends and snaps a full 90 degrees when it dies?
---
Bloodhoof-US! (actually, I'm rolling PvP this time so no Bloodhoof)
---
It would be so sweet if Blizzard floated the idea of re-using the original Alpha version of Karazhan, with it's entirely original and different layout.
---
Another good one it Retalin, sound similar to ritalin a medicine used for adhs and narcolepsy. 
---
Same here. Hurricane dropped for me from a bear in the plaguelands. I was so excited 
---
That is not bad, basicly on par with the better and way more contested farming spots in the world. Wonder if blizzard will leave it unnerfed in Classic. Any idea of how much G/Hour before the nerf?
---
Can confirm. I got a beta key for WotLK through a guaranteed route, and then also received one from the random Blizzard draw. I sold the 2nd key on eBay for a couple hundred bucks. Ebay took it down before it could be completed, but I was already talking to the guy via email and he was keen to complete the transaction regardless. He paid me and I thought wow, I could just block him and he'd be fucked. I didn't, but still, dude was thirsty for that beta. 
---
No pin in classic, only boar charge with 3sec root. 
---
&gt; The wow we have now is about 40% as good as vanilla
---
in my opinion its more like at -500%
---
He‚Äôs just cashing in on some easy views. I hope one of these streamers rolls on a pvp server so I can get revenge for seeing their clickbait thumbnails 24/7
---
&gt;what is a stream delay
---
Nice post, guess it's some sort of tribute?
---
Honestly, Hyjal was the first time I noticed the theme-park feel of the game. It literally started you at the top of the mountain, and gave you two to five quests to do before it sent you 500 feet down the path to the next hub where you do the same thing. Every little vale along the way tried so hard to have it's own theme and gimmick, to the point where the whole zone just felt like a mash-up of the dev quest team's ideas thrown into a blender. 
---
Even Wrath felt like it had a sense of freedom. There was only really 2-4 "major" hubs per zone, and each one sent you across the zone at times. 
---
Vashj'ir was at least slightly more open-ended at points, but Hyjal, Deepholme and Uldum were so on-rails it hardly felt like an open world. I never successfully managed to sneak into old Hyjal, but i remember exploring the off-the-path areas of the raid in Battle for Mount Hyjal back in Wrath. It was so epic and oppressive.
---
xXxlegolas420xXx
---
If somebody takes my real life name, I'm going to be so angry.
---
And you know you are gonna get blamed if the melee dont have WF. So you gotta use fast heal, mana pots and NS:big heals just to move the damn totems.
---
Every single graveyard being camped?
---
God live wow is soulless... 
---
I could be mis-remembering, but i think John Staats, the WoW diary dude, said about a year ago that that was a piece of the scrapped raid The Dragon Isles. I had always wondered about that screenshot before that.
---
Nope, turtles live in the water, tortoises live on land.
---
Warlock is a great class but the class fantasy means that it has taken me more than a decade to get one to lvl 20. 
---
Angwe
---
No, it‚Äôs definitely their game. 
---
You guys are fun, can't wait to see you in game being miserable.
---
&gt;Many people, myself included, have mentioned that there's no way they go full circle. Best case (i.e. furthest they would go) for a Classic+ progression system would be up to WOTLK.
---
Why shouldn't people who want cata be able to play cata? and so on?
---
Seems very hypocritical, either they have to do it for every expansion, or they have to cut it at some point. And why should that be wrath? Should we now be the ones who says shit like "you think you do but you don't". 
---
&gt;1) WOTLK Was the peak of their concurrent subscription base.
---
and? WotlK was one the worst expansons besides questing and PvP.
---
&gt;2) WOTLK Was the culmination of the popular Arthas storyline.
---
and? Deathwing was also based on Warcraft lore.
---
&gt;3) The expansion after WOTLK was cataclysm that required them "reworking" Azeroth. In short, Vanilla+TBC+WOTLK represents a pure mostly unaltered Azeroth with new continents thrown in for storytelling purposes. It also represents (mostly) the pinnacle of raiding and viability of specs as both TBC and WOTLK improved specs to the point that they allowed people to play the spec they wanted, without feeling pigeonholed by efficacy of other specs.
---
So what, Outland and Northrendis literally unchanged on retail, so this is not a valid reason.
---
Great. Can you do it without the wow logo?
---
It‚Äôs unpopular for a reason 
---
She's the main character of the entire Alliance storyline in BfA, so a bit more to it than that. She was also never fighting for her survival. She was trying to slow the horde down so the rest of the Alliance fleet could arrive. When she was getting real hurt she teleported out and hoped it was enough. 
---
Of course, I know. But you can refer as "turtle" to the whole group: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle

**Turtle**
---
Turtles are diapsids of the order Testudines (or Chelonii) characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield. "Turtle" may refer to the order as a whole (American English) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines (British English). The order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. The earliest known members of this group date from 220 million years ago, making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians.

---
yes but the whole point of pulling that boss that everyone skips is because he needs the shoulders. its like the literally the 2nd thing they talk about in the video lol
---
the class with the least rework was warlocks.  
---
shaman tree changed a lot compared to that.
---
I think if they keep similar realm pop caps as vanilla it should be ok. The first few weeks zones will still be like that though, due to the entire server population being in levelling zones. But when people start getting to 60 it starts to thin out a bit. 
---
You also don't want levelling zones to be completely empty, like they were on many servers later on in vanillas life. Almost every zone has at least a few group quests, and dungeons as well. 
---
In a duel with a mate, only joking. FOR THE HORDE 
---
because someone doesn't like some pandery retard who invented a fake persona that is actually just his real life persona with slightly more cringe involved? 
---
good luck with puberty 
---
Why do you want people to change your mind?
---
fantastic
---
Just sounds like ritalin for retards
---
Priest. I can't find anything interesting about them other than them being the best healer. Could also be that I'm not religious and priests look like popes lol
---
can i get sum kappahands in da chat pls 
---
My favourite spot was during MOP in Vale of Eternal Blossom, Mining Ghost iron, would have a few joint while doing that for hours, sadly I no longer smoke, waiting til it‚Äôs legal here
---
Still don‚Äôt know why he needed cloth shoulders of all things.
---
This is how all of retail wow seems to me
---
oof its painful to hear of a rogue getting alcor's.
---
Yes it is.
---
Well, shaman literally has a spell that is equivalent to hearth, so yea it works for them.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I even own the amount of money I would pay to play early access to classic wow 
---
the healing stats on them would be significantly better than any plate he could get. In vanilla a lot of preraid bis and even bis through naxx for healers(and dps) will be mix and matching different armor types. Pallys using cloth/leather/mail in their healing sets and warriors using leather for dps will be a very common sight. 
---
It says it right there, British English, which is the dictionary I chose to go after. So to me turtle is only the seadwelling variant.
---
That was cool though.  It gave you incentive to travel around the world when trading with people because as long as you could get to them in less than an hour, making the trip would be faster than having them mail it to you.
---
And then you get to Legion and pity legendaries :(
---
Oh boy, a random person on the internet with a mic and camera! I MUST HEAR HIS OPPINION!
---
I was in high school, laughing to my friend Who was addicted to vanilla wow to that point that he got kicked out of school, while He spend all the money he got from his parrents to secretely buy 1y subsription...now he is laughing to me 
---
I have absolutely ZERO interest in playing Druid.
---
Used to hide in the hills just outside of org on my 14 warrior (Chucknorris) and charge out to finish duels.
---
Gotta watch out with those $0.02. The older your comment gets, the more they'll be affected by infaltion.
---
I thought this sub was a no changes circle 
---
Yah I don‚Äôt remember a decay in vanilla.  Iirc 50g was cap and once you hit it, it remained 50 for life.  Had to farm a couple hundred a week just to respec for BGs then a couple hundred more for consumables and epic mount
---
Arthas !
---
Perhaps some GM just do a lot more then others and dont delegate responsibility. You are almost along the lines of saying you should get a turn at your bosses wife cause you work for him.
---
The guild leader in my guild is a boss. You do what he says or you dont get 'paid'
---
I would take the free respec and use it to try a new spec and/or build. Would love looking forward to this part of patches the most, before I started caring about balancing.
---
Damn that's some good stufr
---
All one of them.
---
Legally, yes, but i think OP wants to say that they have no vision of the people that originally made the game, and thus they have no right to call the game "theirs".   
---
The thought vector here is "current owner just shamelessly and badly exploits what talented people made" and "It's the game of creators, not legal owners".  
---
That's how I understood it.  
---
Nah, it just makes my game *not fun* and I log off. Mission accomplished, I guess. But it's not like I sit at the PC sobbing. I just play something else, read a book, watch TV or do something else that's actually fun to do.
---
Well, that i can understand, but as a healer when you carry like 40 manapots, every kind of resistance potions, elixirs, foods etc with different equipment setups it does get old even with 4x onyxia bags.
---
And i usually only have like extra trinkets and few items for more mana regen. Its not like i carry complete different sets like warriors do. So if consumables could stack more, that would be nice.
---
Ohh someone please make these into animated wallpaper engines ones!
---
How bout just get a job? Any job? 
---
same here -.-'
---
What's wrong with nuggets?
---
Blade of Eternal Darkness from Maraudon,
---
on my priest. Man I was so happy.
---
Cherries Jubilee and that's it.
---
&gt; which mean tanks can't get def capped in pre raid bis for MC and ONY and will have a hard time being def cap even with ony and mc gear for bwl. 
---
And you forget that tanks dont use def gear in pretty much ANYTHING. They dont have armor talents so they will get more rage with increased damage taken. They use FURY spec, pop DEATH WISH at pull. So why would anyone think lowered def is a negative thing compared to the increases you get from other stuff is beyond me.
---
naww he needs those shoulders for healing remember!
---
paladin
---
Dood. You are a liar and a pussy. Stfu
---
Honestly, I'd just take a unit frame add-on if I were you. Circumvent th eoroblem entirely when. 
---
You don't do it in-game or on the official forums.
---
Ain't it a kid's food? That's how it's viewed in Australia at least. Or at least was. Now it's just viewed as a ticket to an early heart attack.
---
are u sure about the 10g reduction per week? never heard about that.
---
Well sometimes you get a potato with your fries... 
---
People will still find it on account sellin forums and report it for the hell of it.
---
wh√§t?
---
To you, and it's absolutely fine (and the "most" correct), I was just pointing out the little known fact that it *can* be used as both and thus shouldn't be a pedantic reason to correct someone.
---
Maybe hes talking about PTR. I know before AQ launch (on a private server) we did setup own PTR to show ppl that hadnt done c'thun fight, how the run in mechanics worked without and with mounts to avoid stupid mistakes on raid night. We didnt teach boss fights, just tested the run in for a while.
---
You CAN put every possible item on everyone, give them EVERY buff and consumable on earth and let them learn every boss fight in the game without any lost time of running back, gathering materials, time spent on buffing/consus.
---
Still, stupid mistakes do happen even in best, experienced guilds. Like yesterday in guilds PUG mc on golemag, a druid for unknown reason pulled a side trashpack 4-5 elites at boss (with the 2 dog adds). Only one that died was that druid. Because of VERY experienced ppl playing on mains/alts.
---
So there will be ppl that might suck in vanilla raids, but jeesus, there are massive amount of ppl that will do first day clears on every raid when its launched, np.
---
wow "quests" are pretty dumb though
---
why does it matter to you how quick other ppl are clearing raids?
---
What do you mean? This shows how good you can get at the game.
---
It is goal to clear it as fast as possible, you may enjoy it first time, second time, even third time. But after you start having it on weekly farm you will start to perfect your clears to make it super fast, average joes will be far from clearing it this fast tho
---
You dont need the defcap. 
---
On pservers we have tanks running DW fury tanks because threat is s bigger problem. 
---
DM at start is a huge change for healers. Most of your BIS items are from DM, not MC. And there is no limit how many times you can run that, meaning the more "hardcore" ppl will have all of them maybe even before hitting L60.
---
And you can do MC in greens. But with that kind of dps you actually have deal with the mechanics a bit. Cant just brute force everything.
---
That all my favorite zones have shit for questing. Looking at you Alterac Mountains, Azshara, Moonglade, Deathwind Pass!
---
Thanks for the bio man. Do you talk like this everywhere you go? Also, do you get punched in the face a lot?
---
Lupos with shadow damage is stupidly overpowered and hopefully WoW Classic launches with that nerfed.  A Lupos pet can 2-3 shot most players
---
[Capuchin monkeys hate titanforging too.](https://youtu.be/meiU6TxysCg)
---
I think majority of the people will. Everyone has practice and knows how to play the game now. All strats have been known forever. It might take a while but I think most people will end up clearing it. You can disagree, its my opinion. Also tons of guilds playing on Vanilla private servers for awhile now and have mastered like everything.
---
hunter can easily kite paladin. duels on the other hand is a different story but on open ground hunter&gt;pally
---
There was a good grinding spot I remember using as a rogue around 30-40ish, it was camps of satyrs and the name had something to do with xavius. I'm sure I grinded a full 3 levels there and krol blade dropped towards the end. Kinda out the way and the last mob usually respawned as you finished a circuit. I didn't really want to leave when the exp fell off. 
---
Stockade (motherfucking) Pauldrons.
---
Dropped for my leveling warrior while grinding worms in Silithus. To say I was ecstatic would be a understatement; I immediately decided i was destined to be a tank, HSed to Stormwind and respecced protection at ~55 ish. I would later go on to become the 2nd MT and the cause of much, much suffering for my guild at the time - which crashed and burned halfway through a ZG run, never fully clearing MC.
---
I was ~13 and utterly bloody clueless. RIP dime-a-dozen raiding guild with pretentious latin name, the first dagger plunged in your back was from Stockade Pauldrons.
---
Came here to post this
---
Again I'd put it all back in Marks Man.
---
Do that with someone you don't likes name instead
---
I think it's unfortunate if you think about something like this as an adult, instead of simply eating what you like.
---
I had a minion cake for my 25th(? or so) birthday. Because it's super tasty, who cares that it's a child cake.
---

---
Not nearly as much as 1.12 talents and class balance but for some reason nobody complains about that. Primarily the changes to warriors impact the difficulty of raids more than any gear ever could.
---
The nost guys most likely got a hefty lawsuitüòÇ
---
You're entitled to your dreams, but it'll never happen. 
---
I've invested 14 years of my life into Blizzard and I'm about as salty as it gets about what they've become. 
---
I hate the company with a passion these days, and have zero faith that they'll make classic what we all want it to be.
---
Still clinging to a glimmer of hope. Maybe... just maybe they'll get it right. I guess we'll find out. 
---
Honestly that won‚Äôt apply to a huge majority of the player base. My opinion is just play at your own pace and enjoy the play style you enjoy.
---
Yes it allowed me to experiment with many different kinda builds and ideas. One of my favorite memories
---
Missed: Moonglade and Searing Gorge. Knew they were there but forgot the names of those zones.
---
I think it's important to be health conscious. If you're referring to the kid's food part, a processed nugget made from chicken pulp doesn't hold up against almost every other poultry dish. It's a kid's food because it's simple and they're more afraid than an adult to try new foods, i.e. they find more comfort in familiarity.    
---
Paladin, Priest, Shaman.
---
I don't like Paladin and Priest because they're low to medium offense, low CC, low mobility.
---
Shaman because in PvP the class is 90% smart GCD management and totem usage. Totems are IMO just about the only piece of class design in Classic that felt incredibly outmoded by the end of TBC when everybody above 1800 rating would insta delete your totems. They die in one hit, they don't scale, and they're binary.
---
I just suck, I know I suck, but man the feeling of losing because I didn't put a stick in the ground at the right time is so fucking FeelsGoodMan.
---
The fact that two-handed swords, axes and maces shared the same animations has always been pissing me off. That axe has a long handle! Why are you holding it with your hands right next to each other? It's weighted entirely different than a sword! It looked so bad.
---
Cyber squatting is a real thing. It used to be a big thing that people bought the .com domains with popular brand names like mcdonalds, in hopes of selling it for a large sum of money down the line. It worked.  
---
    
---
People are gonna do this on any new server launched, then sell off the names for $$$ or gold.
---
I'm in the same boat, am married and got a ¬Ω year old daughter - My plan is pretty simple. ill be playing in the late evenings, when the little one is sound asleep :)
---
Regarding your Voice com issues, get a pair of headphones that support sidetone, it uses the mic to route sound from your sorrundings into the headset, it works very well.
---
Turns out people back then just sucked. I'm just not good at PvP and even I've managed to win some 1v2s against Warrior/Rogue, Warrior/Mage, Mage/Mage on a few occasions.
---
Not that my opponents were great, but when I lose I don't normally feel it's the class that's holding me back. It's my skill level.
---
As someone still playing live, the WPvP is great and arenas/BGs with friends is fun. Not bothered about much else currently.
---
I loved vanilla, but it was a piece of shit mechanically compared to today's game. Just some things shouldn't have made it live (flying, group finder, sharding etc). So as always opinions are opinions.
---
With that said, nobody takes anything Swifty says seriously. He is and always has been a terrible player. 
---
Link for original screegrabs is at the top of the topic.
---
Jesus christ. You need a mine for the amount of tinfoil hes throwing out there. Pvp templates? Now I remember why this name leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
---
Your Classic won't be like this, so I wouldn't worry. You probably won't be in these guilds. 
---
I legitimately always thought using turtle as the whole species was wrong, so I thought the op was just uneducated, I was never really exposed that much to american English, as I prefer British English, since that is what I was taught, and what I am well fluent in. Ironic as it is, I am better at english than my native tongue.
---
If youre at Mecces and think that your "manly" burger is healthier than nuggets than I honestly dont know what to tell you.
---
I don't know at Mecces is but if we're on the subject of burgers, I make my own.
---
Playing on a private server, I forgot how bad the clutter is.  I have my healing and dps set, a bunch of fire resist gear, consumables, herbs, rep mats, and other misc stuff.  Bank and bag space fill up quick at the later levels.
---
I'm from Australia, and almost 40, chicken nuggets are my go to whenever I get not breakfast McDonald's. Though I think it's been 2 or so years since the last time. 
---
What?
---
That's true, I suppose the grand-majority of players experienced MC with gear from DM already. Never thought of that in this perspective
---
__Its exaggerated. But what he doesnt tell you is the bonus food and drinks made that other guys cholesterol rise, plus got dabetas. And he fat and may not live past 50 due to heart disease.__
---
87%. I didn't realise we're supposed to type the names of capital cities. They're not ZONES man, they're cities SMH.
---
Hunter. Because that class is a joke, and I wouldn't be caught dead playing one.
---
This happens when they practice it on other servers and then zerg it on release.
---
don't compare private servers to classic. the server this was done on has many bugs (for example no buffcap).
---
I don't remember the name of it but it was thick golden sword from Uldaman trash. 
---
I plan on taking 1 or 2 weeks of. But I'm not planning on power leveling myself to 60. At least not on purpose. I'm thinking that after 1 week I'll be level 40 to 45 somewhere. 
---
This is top 1% of the 1% however with using all world buffs, going out of your way to BRD to MC a mob to get a 25 sp buff aswell as stack holiday event consumables, waiting for DMF. This guild has had naxx on farm for ever and is nearly all full bis. Most guilds will disband long befor that happens even the hardcore onces.
---
This basicly requires aligning all the stars yourself. It is not going to be comen at all.
---
Same here. I was deadset on resto druid and everyone says they're shit in pve a raids take only 1. Thinking lock now.
---
Shaman cos of needing a gross 9 hotbar UI
---
And warrior. I'm a caster guy but mained hunter in vanilla.
---
How leather/mail/plate classes often need to wear lower armor types just because the stats are better for them. Which is why i'll be playing a cloth class.
---
A junior western bacon chee
---
McDonalds = Mecces. Atleast where I live. I just assumed when he mentioned the nuggets are childish in Australia he meant in the microcosmos of McDonalds burger are "manly" and nuggets are "childish" whatever thats supposed to mean
---
He's probably German, we call Mcdonalds Mecces sometimes here.
---
^ this, people dont watch youtube videos of top guilds to get clear time, or gold farms etc, yours will always be slower.
---
Yeah, the game does become easier. But how difficult are the MC and Onyxia raids really?
---
Every time a fresh private server launches, MC gets cleared the second they have enough 60s to fill a raid. On the most recent private server launch the first group of raiders to clear MC pugged it.
---
I think the days of chasing brutal difficulty are long past when it comes to classic WoW. Maybe private servers are so incorrect from a mechanical standpoint that the fights are just that much easier, who really knows right? No one has any way of verifying if that's the case. But on these Nostalrius based private servers, most guilds that are capable of building a raiding team do end up clearing Naxx.
---
After nearly 15 years it seems like the new norm among raiding guilds is full clearing content. What difference does it really make in the grand picture if the first wave of raiders spend 30 minutes to an hour extra clearing MC if they're just gonna clear it anyway? People have gotten so much better that even with the earliest itemization possible, everything will still get cleared on the first day no matter the itemization.
---
Just do it better and do it like the germans:
---
shield toad
---
water shield toad
---
No misunderstandings possible!
---
Incorrect. First step is to send C&amp;D letter. Its to avoid any court bullshit which takes long time, and can be easily avoided by mentioned C&amp;D letter, which they received. They received, understood and shutdown their servers.
---
Do you think they would invite Nostalrius guys to their HQ while suing them? 
---
I think it probably did happen more with younger players. But I think as long as it's someone who hasn't had much contact with girls in the real life, they're often kind of prone to this sort of behaviour when they meet them in game.
---
Hate that shitter when you are in a group with 3 melees and you effectively only have one DPSer due to the horrendous armor value. 
---
5dmg
---
8dmg
---
10dmg
---
4dmg
---
...
---
Well in danish it is sheidltoad and ocean shield toad
---
For germans water shield toad and ocean shield toad are different kinds though.
---
The ocean shield toad has flippers and dies by eating plastic it think its jellyfish.
---
Water shield toads are musk turtles, alligator snapping turtles etc.
---
I guess the first "epic" I got was the hyacinth macaw, which was really a white item. So I dropped it as my bags were full. Oops. 
---
My first actual epic was Robes of Insight https://www.wowhead.com/item=940/robes-of-insight which I found out at the time were pretty valuable as people wore them for whatever transmog was called before transmog around cities. I think it went a very long way in to my mount fund.
---
Thank you so much for these they are brilliant! Also you just introduced me to the Barrens Chat website so... thank you again!
---
If that's what they spend their money on then so be it.
---
Okay. We call it Maccas but with a strong Australian accent. So mack-iz.
---
I'd give them all the money
---
Warrior. I'm more on the dark side of magic.
---
[Put it in my bank where it'll stay forever](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse)
---
the crazy thing is i could imagine to play every class as they all have their charm. if was force to name one i would say hunter.
---
Everything already is a breeze. There's a guy on YouTube who solo multiboxes 40 of his own characters that he leveled up and geared manually, through the entirety of MC and BWL.
---
How difficult is it really?
---
Weapon skill past 300 has no effect against same level targets or in PvP in general.
---
Let's remove ALL of the dungeons so MC will be difficult üòàüòàüòà
---
/s
---
what a shit post. this is single a BOO!!
---
Hellfire Peninsula from Outland. Not the way it was introduced in TBC though, like any other levelzing zone. No, it should be a level 60 only place with elite demons crawling around. An open zone where you pretty much need a raid to get to anywhere. Fel orcs, demons, blood elves everywhere. Just a handful of raid quests with some tier one rewards.
---
Anybody who's capable of doing Heroic raids in BfA is overqualified for Naxxramas.
---
Yes
---
I totally forgot Deadwind Pass and Alterac Mountains even existed, because there's almost nothing in them. Got to 44/46 within 4 minutes and couldn't figure out what was missing.
---
Wtf is a realen?
---
I found an AFK 60 warrior tucked in a nice little nook off the coast of STV near where the elite crocos roam. I savaged him with my hunter for a few minutes. He started to move right as I took him from 1% hp to 0. Laughing I ran back to Grom Gol to turn in quests and soak up a teeny bit of rested exp while I let my dog out and started dinner. Walking past the computer room, I heard a commotion and peeked outside the inn. The warrior and three of his friends were turning Grom into a charnel house. I slowly backed into the inn and logged off. Sorry for the retribution fellow hordies!
---
A mate had 'Kang the Decapitatior' drop for him in Feralas in early Vanilla.
---
When I saw him a week later he had a grey wooden mallet equipped. When asked why, he said he'd started get so many wispers in towns and citys that he'd bought the grey to use in order to hide it.
---
Once the debuff limit was raised people stopped caring, and it only mattered before that if your guild had weak gear and really had to min/max. I raided as pvp dagger spec even with Lobo and never had issues
---
Why would you level healer as a priest? 
---
shaman
---
totems suck
---
I don't want to start a 'no change' war again but that was indeed one of the best part of vanilla: waiting for patch, seeing change for your class and looking forward to test and see if you you got your card to the overpowered club (or lament over the nerf hammer) 
---
I feel a bit sad that everything will be in stone forever and we won't have that thrill anymore
---
This has already been posted 
---
I think they should just worry about classic for now 
---
As a vanilla veteran my first thought was: 
---
why would you want to remove Thunderfury and Windfury wtf is this shit.
---
You dont take dmg in cat form due to feline's grace passive skill.
---
Yea, personally I don't have a problem with it. I was the one who got shouted at for having it. lol. So I'm just speaking from experience here. We cleared Naxx, so we were fairly serious. 
---
As for the goblin packs, the way my guild and the pug I joined weekly on my alts did it was the one warrior or druid would do the aoe shout on them, all mages would flamestrike and blizz and the locks would also aoe them. The melee would take care of the warlocks then the spellbinders before coming back for the drakonids iirc.
---
The tier 1 warrior bracers from MC!
---
I'm afraid people are like you
---
Raids usually take 2 or 3 resto and its a good thing because that mean raid gear is easy to get.
---
but isn't that a good thing because it makes bagspace and bags more valuable? Everyone is so happy when they get an ony bag.
---
Oh boy, here we go!    
---
I‚Äôve always loved paladins, but didn‚Äôt play one in vanilla (at least not level 15+), I started maining them in wotlk. However, i leveled one recently on a pr*vate server and really liked it (class fantasy does it for me). I did a ton of research and know that i‚Äôd heal in raids, i‚Äôd optimally would go holy (maybe reck) in pvp, and that i‚Äôd be a sick utility pvp healer in premades and groups.    
---
Anything more to add?    
---
How well can they farm gold?    
---
Do you guys think the ret stigma will get cleared in classic?    
---
How is ret in pvp in your opinion (i‚Äôve read several good and bad comments about them, ranging from please don‚Äôt ever bring a ret to bg up to they are versatile and pretty strong)?    
---
Am I better off going rogue/warrior if i want to FEEL useful?    
---
I‚Äôm so excited about paladins and will definitely level one to 60, i just want to hype myself ty
---
northern part of alterac, right below UC
---
It‚Äôs a pretty great analogy really 
---
Warlock.
---
There's just something about it. I find the playstyle terrible. I would also be cursed with terrible pet names.
---
I made three in wow:
---
Voidwalker 1: Crack'Gap
---
Voidwalker 2: Chav'Thug
---
Imp 3: Lozfap (I'd literally just broke up with my ex-GF named Loz)
---
Then again, It could be awesome: https://m.imgur.com/ssP0Jb9
---
&gt;This happens when they practice it on other servers and then zerg it on release.
---
Classes in full tier 3 'on release': Sure.
---
"Mcforges" lmao.. cracked me up for some reason
---
can you explain to someone who has not participated what the drums of war and collecting exactly was.
---
I remember people being annoyed at this because they had to look up the best talents or put some thought into it again. Me, I loved it
---
Actually it does, as I said it gives 0.02% crit against same level targets. It's not like I would make up a random number :O
---
He seems super uninformed and doesn't seem to be following Classic too closely. 
---
Hell, one of the Nost guys is a dev for classic now because of it all. 
---
Where did I say that's going to happen? It's what happened on that video of a private server.
---
Fucking he'll.
---
That sums him up regarding about anything he makes vids about. 
---
&gt; Hell, one of the Nost guys is a dev for classic now because of it all
---
Source? Last time I checked (/heard), none of them are. At least that's what I remember Nano saying.
---
Was on a ClassiCast when they had the original WoW lead on iirc. 
---
Kinda cool, any more of this?
---
Hi, /u/RoccomGG
---
A 60 rogue jumped a buddy and me in shimmering flats when we were leveling.  We were in our 40s, I was a paladin and he was a rogue.  We both survived somehow and it was glorious. 
---
I wish classic streamers got their own reddit so this one wouldn't be flooded with their content...
---
It ofc was a bug but it took ages to get fixed by blizz. You were able to start duels there and some other stuff you couldn't do in cities like mounting up and so on. It was hella fun :-)
---
I'm glad!
---
Hi glad, I'm dad!
---
Well, let me quote you again:
---
&gt;This happens when they practice it on other servers and then zerg it **on release.**
---
So to answer your own question, see the bolded part. How else did you meant that to be read?
---
now i feel like such an asshole... i didnt see the bigger picture and only focused on myself... i hate being a pvper and not help the world kill old gods or dragons..
---
*Then:*
---
I 14 years old and in junior high. I played the closed beta as a dwarf paladin. I played alot of Counter-Strike 1.5 at LAN-parties. I was a huge nerd. Watched Stargate SG1. Listened to Linkin Park.
---
*Now:*
---
I'm 28 years old. I work as an IT-consultant. I play vanilla wow on a private server. Still a huge nerd. Still watch stargate SG1 from time to time. Still listening to Linkin Park. I dont play any Counter-Strike though, and the time of LAN-parties is long gone.
---
Rogue. Back in Vanilla I mained a Druid and Shaman. Rogue just doesn't appeal to me at all. 
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with levelling on a PvP server and getting ganked innumerable times by rogues at every step and turn. 
---
I would usually just jump over to the " old Zg" ( not going threw the instance portal ) and just fish in its waters there. withought having anyone bugg me :) killing fish still counts right? 
---
but this wait is just too much.
---
Shaman, I would never roll horde and live in filthy mudhuts.
---
You should also make a Winterspring one with a Black Lotus in it. Would be awesome.
---
Great job anyways!
---
I will name my character Pittsburg. For Pittsburg Pensylvania. I've never been there.
---
I was saying, even with maxed out char bag space, carrying all (not mentioning anything about looting or grinding stuff) is getting annoying.
---
It would be interesting to have all instances open at start to see what kind of gear you really need to kill KT.
---
Fuck streamers. 
---
I was chilling in Orgrimmar one evening on my Druid when one of the raiding guilds suddenly messaged me asking if I wanted to come on their MC raid. They had the place on farm but they had no Druids available. I'd never seen the inside of MC so I agreed. They added me to their DKP system in case they wanted me again. They didn't care I was Balance specced; they just wanted the Innervate and MoTW. Mind you the mages fought to be in my group for the crit aura. 
---
An hour later my Druid had 3 Tier 1 set pieces because bosses just kept dropping them. I was at some ridiculous amount of negative DKP since they didn't believe in disenchanting something if someone could use it, so they just laughed and gave it to me. 
---
i'll always remember those leafy shoulders on my female Tauren druid. 
---
I doubt there will be many raids sporting a ret, but this is usual of hybrids. Still that shouldn‚Äôt stop you from putting on some int gear and healing.
---
If you want to be useful, play what you want but be good at it. 40-man raids means no class will be in short supply. Good players that know the boss tactics, specific class tactics for the raid and so on, however, are rare.
---
If you want to have an almost-guaranteed spot in raida play healer; for raid healing priest is the strongest, druid the weakest.
---
Already posted and he's a weird prick.
---
im pretty sure its 1 second root
---
I played during vanilla and raided as holy. When we hade MC and BWL on farm i respecced to ret and played "critadin". It is fun but it is a meme class compared to geared pure dps classes. As critadin you run around and sometimes the stars align and you one - two shot people. As a geared warrior you do that alle the time. That being said, it was fun running around feeling like a holy warrior and smiting down unworthy advesaries. 
---
Paladin is a support class. One of the best. And if you want to get the full potential of the class you should consider yourself a defensive support. A warrior with a holypaladin as support can carry battlegrounds. Personally I would recommend going 31/20/0 or 31/13/7 (buffing judgements) or if 26/25/0 (reck). This is on personal experience and not deep theorycrafting. I just think going 31 deep in ret makes you glasscannon and does not play toward the true strength of the class. I also might add that if you want to raid it will 99% be as holy. Any guild that want to have progress in raids will require people to have optimal speccs (If I was GM or class-officer I certainly would. But you can still kill people solo with 31 deep in holy. But it will usually be through attrition and not big critts. For inspiration watch "Zalgradis" pvp videos:

---
When it comes to gold, I never had trouble with it. But I never bought anything expensive from the AH, and used to sell ore or bars from mining. 
---
I do belive the stigma vill persist. If only because it has become about min / max. And ret paladins will never be as good damage dealers as a warrior / rogue or other pure dps classes. 
---
Hope this was to some help :)
---
Just like when Star Wars Galaxies was released people tried every iteration of Chewie.
---
its staged, so he needed it for the memes. check his interview
---
the old "should I have account password or desired character name at the clipboard" dilemma
---
Doing God‚Äôs work here 
---
Yeah I totally hear you and agree to an extent.
---
Ursas in winterspring. Once you get some gear you can pull 4 at a time, cleave em down, and collect extremely useful loot. 3 rich thorium veins spawn right there too as well as a chest. 
---
If you level extremely fast it would be worth it to just go there at 58 and grind to 60. 
---
&gt;Hunters already suffer enough in classic.
---
Please, hunters are OP.
---
Well you could just have the whole raid not wear their best gear and find out. Lol.
---
pretty sure GMs have the important names already reserved.
---
Then again Activision did fire most of them, so you might be in luck.
---
Part of the strength of Shield Block is not needing to be def capped to become uncrittable if needed.
---
Yeah tank itemisation took a downgrade, but the increased DPS and HPS more than make up for it and it's not even close.
---
Except we went from completely being a rogue-crusher to being meh against them.  Hunters mark lasting through vanish, very short cooldown on flare, etc made rogues probably one of the easiest classes to deal with.
---
Do anyone have a list how to gear for Ele Pvp before mc and bwl is out? Which items to get in which dungeons
---
When assaulting a horde stronghold outnumbered 5:1, but all pop their elune and run in with sapper charges.
---
However I will be the hordie that gets nuked. :(
---
Whilst I disagree with your assessment of TBC, the direction Classic goes entirely depends on its success.
---
Anything post-naxx requires dev time which means investment by Blizzard, so the game needs to be popular and ideally growing for investment to be released.
---
I think there is some merit to taking Classic on it's own journey though. Karazahn would require minimal adjustment - just creating a loot table and ensuring encounters are feasible with a 40 man (I suspect they mostly are)
---
There's also stuff like Grim Batol and the unfinished Azshara BG/Zone, plus the Emerald Dream. It's not like there aren't lvl60 projects that were in the works that could be brought to a "Classic" realisation. However all of these would require a large degree of dev work and a trust from the community that todays Blizzard could deliver new "classic" content that did the original game design justice.
---
On the other hand, the TBC and Wrath storylines were historically great successes and so it'd probably be a safer option for Blizzard to put the Classic life cycle in that direction. 
---
If TBC was the weak expansion OP claims then I could potentially see Blizzard creating an alternative universe bridge into Wrath sans flying mounts and done entirely in Azeroth, but realistically I think if we see any post-classic content, it'll be more remakes.
---
Let me hit you with some knowledge:
---
Blizzard is a company owned by Activision.
---
Activision, not Blizzard, handles the hiring and firing.
---
Activision just fired 800+ employees while the CEO Bobby ‚ÄúSemen-Stain‚Äù Kotick went on record saying ‚Äúthis was their most profitable year in history‚Äù. 
---
Blizzard was also hit with layoffs, especially hard in the CM sector (GMs, Moderators etc.)
---
Now, armed with this information, connect the dots.
---
The ‚Äúmiss‚Äù sound effect. What the hell is that supposed to be? A hollow piece of bamboo falling on the ground?
---
Lol, I have watched plenty of streamers on PvP servers that played just fine while streaming.. sure it might be a hassle if you have 10k viewers+, but the vast, vast majority of streamers have less than 1000 viewers, hell, even less than 100.   
---
If you have 100 viewers, chances are maybe one or two people will come and fight you.. probably on good terms too. It will only be a problem for the few biggest streamers, like 5-10 people at best.
---
Yes, and?
---
There were a few other location bugs but I don‚Äòt remember where they exactly were do you remember them?
---
I wouldn't say it's a 1:1 copy of retail vanilla, but still close enough that you shouldn't expect vastly different results in classic. The major boss mechanics work as they should, and things like weapon skill coding not being completely understood is offset by most bosses having vastly more armor.
---
I remember in Rift casters used their staves to cast spells instead of just keeping them on their back. Simple but cool detail I wish WoW had
---
&gt;kokujin
---
Dodging name restrictions by using translated versions of the name is clever, if somewhat amoral. 
---
I'm more than happy to get a 4p mcnugget to drop and split it out to 39 of my best friends, but really only 2-6 of my best friends cuz u know classes and such.
---
Shamans can't use swords
---
:((((((
---
Missed Burning Steppes, Tirisfal Glades &amp; Deadwind Pass :(
---
Yeah, dude has no clue what he is talking about. Like he trying explaining how the pvp system is gonna be implemented with vendors and shit meanwhile no one actually knows exactly how blizzard plan on doing it. Talking about internal cooldowns on sword spec procs and stuff; where is he even getting that from??? Dude is probably just terrified of losing his retail viewer base when classic blows up
---
You‚Äôre right.
---
It is an unpopular opinion.
---
&gt; [However, at BlizzCon 2018, developers Brian Birmingham and John Hight stated that there were no members of the Nostalrius team working on WoW Classic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalrius#WoW_Classic_and_ties_to_Nostalrius)
---
&gt; [I've said this on a different podcast, I said that I have not spoken to Viper and Daemon recently(..), so I have no idea whether they are working for Blizzard or not](https://youtu.be/odClLkqcmz0?t=2668)
---
Sorry but to me it looks like that's not right. Unless of course you can link actual sources that state the opposite of that.
---
I had a great one recently on LB. My little level 40ish warrior was afk in Kargath and when I came back I'd been killed. Confused I ran back to my body only to see a max level geared warrior ripping into the guards. He was kicking arse but getting low on HP as I watched him rip the place up, so I rezzed and charged him and stunned him just long enough to let the guards finish him off. I felt righteous as fuck as i /spit on him.
---
Muhhh fkn kresh 
---
As a ret paladin this was so good
---
Yes 1920x1080 would be great
---
That‚Äôs my time frame too!
---
Disallow stupid fucking names in all mmos
---
Chop a bit off of each side and you will have 1920x1080 :)

You get the nuggets you paid for, but now with a small chance to get extras. That's clearly better than not having that chance. Imagine being such a horrible person that you get upset about it because there's a chance people other than you can get lucky.
---
It's a bad analogy.
---
RIP HIDDENS
---
They can and they did many times.   
---
The remaining notable servers are either legally-protected or simply too small (and dealing with them might be too expensive). With servers being non-profit and the development providing their own code Blizzard can kick and scream if they want but it won't matter. The original company can't really do anything because the development running the emulation are only supplying their own code and creation.
---
Dont miss out on the goblin sponsorship chain, first quest is to kill the vultures in shimmering flats, the chain involves stv &amp; dustwallow and is nice xp boost around 8-10 quests.
---
I said JUNIOR!.. western bacon chee.
---
Where my bubble + hearth crew!?
---
First Huhuran would be a decent option.
---
Can't really remember, but with some solid gear and slow bow you landed ~3k crits with aimed shot. Generally clothed players with entry gear got instagibbed and it was glorious. 
---
T2 geared hunter with thunderfury was a wrecking ball. I remember when top guild migrated to our server and their GM was just destroying everyone in WSG by just raptor striking the crap out of people. But yeah hunter with proper gear could fairly easily global people given 2-3 crits.
---
Vanilla wow and Tenacious D, this day just keeps getting better and better
---
They will level pve to avoid the cancer then probably transfer to a pvp server.  So everyone who dodged them initially might have to deal later on
---
Krol blade was pretty damn good though before raid weaps. 
---
Elemental spec really comes into its own when you get a lot of crit gear. The weakest point of elemental is probably early when you lack the HP to survive without barrier and the spellpower and crit to really take advantage of elementals strengths.
---
It's still a good spec, and a lot more fun than Frost/arcane, but at low gear levels Barrier/imp CS is probably overall the better choice.
---
You're talking about an extra second to type in a name. I really doubt that second is going to make much difference.
---
I never understood that argument. MC and BWL/Ony are already easy content in todays terms, why make it even easier? 
---
Sounds like people want LFR mode in Classic because they are not able to socialize.
---
Will it be (or eventually become) ez mode? Definitely.
---
Do I care? Not really.
---
I've unraveled the mythic shroud about so-called "Vanilla difficulty" in 2010 on feenix. The difference between heroic Lich King and your average ZG raid was crystal clear. 
---
And yet, I'm still playing it, Because the game process itself is that involving. 
---
In Vanilla raids isn't the point where the game starts, it is the final destination. 
---
Playing on 60 is like "meh not for all 6/10", while road to 59 is "OH MY GOD 10/10 WOULD RUIN MY LIFE AGAIN ANYTIME". That's the idea :)
---
And maybe that isn't that bad, either. For example you could take your GF alongside with you (not on the core role ofc, atleast for the first time) and she will not get shit on by.
---
I'm pretty sure he says "At least I **ain't** chicken"
---
You know, because he's not a coward?
---
75% of the chars made at launch probably won't make it to level 20. The other 25% will ding 20 at vastly different timings, spread out over several days.
---
That‚Äôs already irrelevant because the new afk-front drops ilvl 400.
---
Streamers are easy targets for gankers. I bet we‚Äôre not going to have that many players streaming on pvp servers. 
---
What the hell is OSRS?
---
And why is this is a problem? You do realize that a player that invests more in a game should ALWAYS be more powerful than a player that doesn't?
---
Also, a veteran player should ALWAYS be more powerful than a rookie, because this is how games work?
---
Classic should stay Classic for a good while (I'd say 3 years before either going TBC or alternative route) and new Classic realms should open periodically.
---
I said this before so many times, and logically proved WHY going TBC after Classic is not only stupid, but it is also 100% sure that TBC is not going to happen.
---
What are Blizzard's options with what is AFTER Classic? There aren't many, to be honest. First one is that there is NOTHING after Classic. It would be Classic and that is it. However, this option is financially unsustainable. In just 2 years, most Classic realms will be basically empty. Opening NEW Classic realms is a short term solution, and it will have, AT BEST, a marginal success, because most players ALREADY finished the Classic content, and they won't start it again.
---
The fact that the private Vanilla servers are partially successful is because we do not have OTHER OPTIONS.
---
The second option is for Blizzard to go TBC way, and have ALL Classic realms go TBC. However, A LOT of players do not want TBC. I see some people arguing for a character copy from Classic to TBC realms, like this is a great solution. Well, it is not, because Blizzard will have to keep both Classic and TBC realms, with a split player base, which will negatively affect BOTH Classic and TBC realms.
---
But there are also players who want to PROGRESS from Classic to TBC. What than? Have THREE different types of realms? One Classic only, one TBC only and one Classic&gt;TBC progress realm? 
---
The third option is for Blizzard to don't give a fuck about what players want, and simply make ALL REALMS progressive Classic &gt; TBC realms. Well, that will make sure that they will lose half of their Classic players, AT LEAST. But than you are facing the NEXT problem : WOTLK.
---
Lots of players are arguing that going trilogy way (Classic&gt;TBC&gt;WOTLK) is all what Blizzard should do. Sure, this MIGHT be an option, but HOW will Blizzard do it? Keeping separate realms for each variant of WoW (Classic , TBC and WOTLK) or simply make ALL REALMS progress from Classic to TBC to WOTLK?
---
Well, neither of the solutions is financially viable for Blizzard. And this is what MATTERS FOR THEM. We do not have Classic because ActiBlizz grew a heart, it is because Classic is making them MONEY. All private TBC servers are a disgrace and FAR LESS populated compared to Vanilla private servers. This FACT alone, and the FACT that Blizzard said that they don't plan for TBC ( yeah, I know, they said the same for Classic - but Nost make them rethink Classic - there is no TBC Nost that could do the same) means that TBC is clearly not an option for ActiBlizz.
---
The fourth option is to go a DIFFERENT PATH after Classic.
---
Now, this option is unpopular (on this sub), but it is the ONLY OPTION that is the closest to become a reality. The problem is that we are dealing with ActiBlizz, and lots of players (me included) do not trust them. It also implies developing costs for ActiBlizz, but at least, they have OSRS example that if players are included in decisions, Classic can become a REAL MONEY MAKING MMORPG.
---
Now, which players would be able to vote on proposed changes and/or new content? That is clearly an issue, because a rookie should never be able to vote. Also, what percent should be needed ? 80% ? 75% ? Less ? And ultimately..again, this is ActiBlizz. They can implement a change that they think is good, and simply fake the polls. Just because they are "always right".
---
All that being said, in optimal conditions (meaning ActiBlizz implementing an OSRS-like voting system) new content for Classic is the best financial and logistical option for ActiBlizz and also will have the vast majority of voting players behind.
---
It is a lot to talk about such a system, and it will require a new topic, but I, personally, do not want TBC and WOTLK, nor do I want to replay Classic for 10 years.
---
I want something new, be it a NEW WoW-like game or a NEW content for Classic. A new WoW-like game is probably out of the question, hence, NEW content for Classic (WHILE KEEPING Classic realms only permanently ) that have the support of the players, is more than likely.
---

I hit r13 on my Druid and had some Aq40 pieces and went feral.  Nobody expected it, it was great.  I was a super tanky, mobile rogue with self heals.

I remember boosting my friend's warrior through WC as a hunter. We've spotted this turtle and I was like "Oh look, this guy is gonna drop the badass [shield](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13245), woo! And then he drops [this...](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6447)". 
---
We were ROFLING all over the next couple minutes =) 
---
That was already a WOTLK times, and we were playing on a private server. And, while on the live server Blizz turned the second shield into a good blue, it was still white there, and was, in fact, the only thing that dropped that time :)
---
Oh yeah, I forgot we had a 10 yard range on it during vanilla lol.
---
Yeah, the only way to get your pet out then is telling him to go further away from you (sending it to atack something far away) and then you run the opposite way so the pet despawns.
---
Yup. It's 1 second.
---
/u/Emfx I take it you don't have sources?
---
Someone did not get the joke 
---
I never like Priests and Warrior. I played everything else to a point, but couldn't level those two at all, got too bored.
---
I‚Äôll have to find the video when I get home from work.   Tried finding it this morning but ran out of time. 
---
I'm pretty sure it's the other way around.
---
Sadboy children love some horde.
---
I'm old, but I find alliance boring :(
---
So that's where [this](https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs?t=173) joke came from...
---
No, it's not clearly better, at all. Getting your McNuggets McForged to a full on McWhopper devalues the McWhopper and decentivices people from buying it in the first place, because not only does the McWhopper come with that one secondary McSauce you don't like, it would also be cheaper to buy 3 4 piece McNuggets and potentially have them all become McWhoppers.
---
On top of that, recurring customers will feel cheated when they buy their 14th pack of 4 piece McNuggets and they still haven't gotten that 12 piece McForge, when the person clearly eating there for the first time, with very little appreciation for the food at all, walks away with a 20 piece McNuggets, a large soda, a large side of fries, a dip sauce and 6 McOnion Rings. All without spending more than a for a 4 piece McNuggets.
---
I want to keep my McNuggets, all 12 of them, and if anyone else wants 12 nuggets too, they're free to walk up and pay just like I, and many others before me have.
---
Anytime the folks at McDonald's give me one or two extra nuggies I will forever consider it as me getting titanforged McNuggies.
---
Yes, you and the other millions of people who buy it.
---
Hahhahaha, you ok?
---
You really got lost, huh?  Poor guy. This wasnt that hard of a concept.
---
Each side had specific turn ins they had to complete for AQ opening to progress.  Google it, the whole lead-up to the opening is amazing. 
---
&gt; Forget about 1.13
---
Classic (demo) patch is literally 1.13 :p
---
You know its complete?  How?  What if something wasnt discovered?
---
I don't know why its so hard for you people to understand such a simple concept.
---
Swifty was never a Vanilla player, hence, his opinion on the matter is moot.
---
I don't like to lie
---
He doesn't have a clue about this subject.
---
There is no WPvP in WoW since Vanilla.
---
Wait, what?  
---
Feline grace " Reduces damage from falling", not mitigates all of it. He loses 1704 hp to the fall in the video.  
---
Hurricane is in balance tree. Can't you use it in moonkin form?
---
I guess so, but it‚Äôs only a bad analogy because the two customers aren‚Äôt competing, and the nuggets aren‚Äôt prestige items.
---
If you trained all your life to become swole or something, dedicating hours upon hours to building up your physical fitness in the gym, and then some random dude walks into the gym for the first time in his life and instantly McForges into a marble God, you would rightfully be pissed. It invalidates all your effort.

OMG that's the first baby-related thing I've seen that I need in my life - I recently picked up DnD, and hope to bring the kid to DnD nights when it becomes a bit older :)

I wanted to play holy and didn't have money for respecs back then. Also shadow wasnt great back in the day anyway

Look, I'm going to be real here. I don't like sharding at all. I consider it to be very anti mmo and it could ruin some of the stuff that made vanilla what it was (ss vs tm PvP,  city raids, aq event, etc). That said i understand why they want to use it at launch and find it acceptable that they use it in such a manner. That is so long as they stay true to their word, blizzard has lied before about sharding and technically using sharding at launch is already a backpedal from when they initially said no sharding at all.
---
However sharding should be used in the manner they described and that is it, no more and no further. The 1 to 10 zones and maybe the first month tops. Sharding should never be seen in classic again, period, end of discussion. 
---
That means no sharding anywhere in the world for any reason. Holiday event? AQ? No and no. 
---
The reason for this is a few reasons. Firstly a major point of vanilla and sharding reduces player interactions. 
---
Another is scarcity.  Everything was scarce in vanilla, whether that be resources or gold. It didn't matter if your server had 500 people or 2,000 people, their was a finite number of resources that didn't change. With sharding you could abuse the system and cause an excess of resources to spawn. Want extra lotus? Go to a zone with a swarm of bodies and watch sharding kick in
---
Unless you're pretty young or a midget your BMI really shouldn't be 16.
---
I think the SoC proc is similar to mortal strike from an arms warrior with two differences:
---
- No reduced healing debuff;
---
- You don't get to push the button, RNG does it for you (up to 7 times a minute).
---
Change my mind!
---
Yeah because the other person is likely spamming the login also bith
---
I named a hunter after this bow. lol
---
Ret is pretty good in PvP. Main disadvantage is a lack of mobility, so I'd recommend getting engineering. 
---
If you're running premade BGs, you're better off going holy/ret or holy/prot. These builds always go for Illumination, often take Divine Favour and spend the rest of their talent points on ret damage or Reckoning.
---
Pretty sure that's on the far southern edge of nowhere, actually.
---
Follow your heart and the light brother! Come on up and bubble+hearth with us come Classic launch!

This isn't Ghamoo-Ra

All the names you mentioned are awesome. The ex gf one was unfortunate, though.

i agree with one of the commenters that it would probably be useful for taming some rare pet
---
Honestly there will be a shit ton of dads and moms playing Classic. 
---
You would be suprised how manu there are in even semi hc guilds, it just takes planning. Maybe 2 nights a week you have to ask the wifey to put the kids to sleep and those 2 nights wont involve any cosing in the sofa together and there is your window. 
---
The other days you can compensate and play with your speakers, farm materials and whatnot that doesnt need 100% attention and be a good dad/husband. 
---
Give her/him/whatever 2 other nights a week. 
---
I think havig kids between 6-12 is the worst age to get gaming time since they are old enough to want to be outside the house, but to young to transport themselves at afternoon/evenings. 
---
Before that they are too young and after that age they are old enough to ride the bus/bicycle to the soccerpractice or whatever they like. 
---
Gaming is my hobby and I dont treat it differently from lets say ‚Äùplaying squash with the buddies two nights a week‚Äù. Somehow the latter is usually nothing anyone reacts about, but if its ‚Äùplaying videogames‚Äù its suddenly a bad thing. 
---
That's what I did. I'd rather see the Class symbol instead of the portrait. Makes it easier to detect enemy players class too.
---
Haha. I remember me and a friend were dueling in STV (lock and spriest). I beat him and he was on like 1 HP. Some lvl 30 ish rogue comes up and kills my friend (the spriest). Then sprints off. I mounted up (on my shitty 60%) and gave chase. He got into stealth so we were hunting him for a while and we eventually found him and corpse camped him for about half an hour afterwards until he begged us to stop.
---
And then stop at level 12 when they realize they don‚Äôt like auto attacking as a rotation 
---
Even tho I didn‚Äòt know that video before you can say with reasonable certainty that this joke came because of this bugüòÑ funny, that video was great had a few great chuckles
---
Screw it up with things that just kill the game, like retail.
---
Bad/average druids: meh
---
Good druids: godlike
---
I've kept this on every single character ever and never used it.
---
Paladin. It's just tedious. Nothing to do but auto-attack
---
The turtles on the east coast of the Hinterlands
---
Gotcha but it does need some tuning. Not to appease the casuals but to keep people who love the hardcore aspect but want to say...Want play a paladin and have fun?
---
Well no, it looks shit, it is shit statistically, it would be shoehorned rather than integrated, and the story line they had in mind involved finding the lost Mograine in Outland.
---
Depends on your point of view. For the most part casters are the big losers of early itemization because casters were reworked midway through vanilla. I played Warrior on a private server and life was completely fine for me since the difference between pre-buff gear wasn't that big. I still had ways to scale my character.
---
Pre-buff caster gear OTOH was completely terrible because Blizzard completely reworked caster mechanics at one point.
---
At the start of vanilla spell damage bonuses didn't exist. Casters were supposed to scale their damage via critical strike (% crit on gear and int stacking) plus negative resistance stacking.  
---
Pre-rework you could stack negative resistances which worked fine in PvE since mobs had varying resistance levels, but it was busted in PvP because players had 0 base resistance and you couldn't bring a full set of resistance for each school. How were you even supposed to guess which set to wear against a Mage? Guess wrong, put on Fire resistance vs. a Mage and find out he's Frost spec. Now what?
---
The other thing that was different is critical strike multipliers for spells were completely rescaled. The modern values are like 150% untalented, 250% talented. Pre rework it was like 200% untalented and 400% talented. On private servers where they revert to the original itemization casters are actually nerfed compared to the early retail versions because the gear is made for version 1.1 but the caster mechanics are still 1.12.
---
As a Warrior player I'm not really too affected by old itemization because the core class mechanics remained the same. But it doesn't seem like a good solution to revert caster gear to the original stats because their core mechanics were reworked. They basically lose out on a bunch of scaling that they originally had.
---
Imagine thinking that blizzard wont gonna screw up Classic
---
Imagine still being a blizzard fanboy 
---
Their pvp as a duelist is unmatched.
---
Their group pvp is boring af.
---
Rogue is a wpvp champ but sucks in bg
---
Wait so you are saying that you have not moved to the nearest data center that hosts the server so you get that few MS faster?
---
You can play a pally and have fun, not everyone is looking for top tier performance, that's just absurd, not every player is going to utilize 100% of their class either.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt 
---
Were there to be progressive Vanilla content, in a similar fashion to how OSRS works (and I highly doubt that this'll happen) then that's a possible addition. This falls in line with other 'original scraps' like Hyjal, Karazhan etc.
---
Other than the above scenario, no. Looking forward to getting the Corrupted one either way. ^^
---
Druid‚Äôs are beast. Anyone who says otherwise didn‚Äôt play them in Classic. And honestly, they‚Äôre very hard to master, so even Druid‚Äôs who did play them probably sucked. Skill ceiling on druid is higher than any other class IMO. They have huge build variety, lots of build variation, run speed boost at 20 and entangling roots makes rogues and warrior duels a joke
---
So perfect game? Just curious 
---
someone lend me money, back in vanilla i farmed 3 days to pay him back.
---
In combination with 2 Bone Slicing Hatchet [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=18737](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=18737) axes
---
and 2 x 15 agi enchants it was ver power-full bow and i started to get strong.
---
i replaced it later with core marksman rifle [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18282](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18282) before i got the Rhok'delar/Hunter quest.
---
I wouldnt want balancing changes till like a year in. But I would like things like a group finder and arena's. Fuck what people say about it, spamming for 2 hours to get a group together in trade is ass
---
True dat
---
Because blizzard may screw it up. 
---
My guild in Classic was called the "Lights of Elune" (primarily an elf-focussed guild on an EU RP server).
---
Naturally everyone had this item in your bank. It was pretty much expected that noone would have the heart to actually use it.
---
So perfect game? just curious
---
No, it‚Äôs the streamers too.
---
I'm just scared they will f#!$ it up. That's all. Don't care about nostalgia. And it's neither a perfect game. I love it for exactly what it is and I don't want them to just screw everything up. 
---
I like how he thinks maybe i gave a bad rock, and checks to make sure its hard against the wall the second time.
---
TBC servers have failed every time they try‚Äôs an pop up for the reasons OP explained
---
I hope they don‚Äôt go this route. Keep it straight vanilla. Introducing TBC will fragment and kill the Classic experience, and make even more patching and API work for Blizz which they prob don‚Äôt want to handle.
---
Nah I dont like the group finder i bought a month membership just recently and it sucks...no communication or even talking. I was the weirdo when I said "whatsup" in the party chat. I remember it being a big deal to get a full dungeon group like it was a accomplishment, having to boot idiots and noobs that's part of the fun/harcore experience
---
You are right, I'm stupid, carry on.
---
Not close enough until proven with original data.
---
Pretty sure we gonna get retail graphics which I still dont really care for...I just want it to last. 
---
Oh interesting - so just run around until you can grab RH quests instead of being stuck in the valley of trials waiting on respawns then?
---
To clarify
---
The money is not the player that died‚Äôs money.
---
It‚Äôs just a random small amount generated by server 
---
And in anywhere other than battlegrounds, no, corpses are not lootable
---
It's "realm" but the OP can't grammar for shit.
---
I got what you need
---
Im currently living a ret on private server and everywhere you read that humans are the end all be all. This obv because of sword spec. But out of all the endgame weapons you could argue for as a ret, 80% are not swords. In fact, most are axes, especially pre-raid. Why are humans still so heavily favored when the only reason is so close to nonexistant, especially since dwarves are insane when AQ opens? 
---
For them to finish dustwallow marsh
---
Oof, back to Statistics 101 with you.
---
He's a healer warrior.
---
He screams his name at the wounds until they heal.
---
If you try balancing the classes you are going to have to balance raids, pvp, and not only all the work involved but it's no longer classic after that. It would absolutely ruin the balance of PVP if they tried to make all specs raid viable. 
---
Although I like the system runescape has runescape also has a better community. Retail people would ruin the vote out of spite. I see that as a great chance the community ruins the game instead of Blizzard. The game is fine as it is. Not all specs are good at everything but every spec is good at something. 
---
This is exactly how southshore vs tarren mill happened. This is what people want, I supposed. 
---
Great work dude :)
---
Its not a myth bro we just never had enough time to find it. But now we got one more chance.
---
That's a much better analogy. It would be nice if people didn't blindly upvote just because of the general "WoW is bad now" message.
---
I remember dueling people near the stairs between IF bg area and the center. Where they put dummies later on.
---
0 Reason to keep ret an prot in shit tier if you can tweak a few numbers around. I don‚Äôt buy that this will inevitably destroy the game. On the contrary, it‚Äôll just make it possible to have fun in more ways than what the strict meta back then happened to make the best. 
---
I don't care either way. Just wanna play on a heavily populated without changes to the core system and mechanics.
---
Well I‚Äôm planning on playing after work and I to early/mid evening EST if you‚Äôre down to level
---
I also happen to main a warrior tank, so let's break down the abilities you listed as warrior utility and do some comparisons to shamans:
---
**Taunt, AoE Taunt &amp; Mocking blow** \- There is no denying that these abilities are useful and that the shaman tank doesn't have anything that's even close to being comparable, as I mentioned in my comment. But really they're just part of the warriors aggro management toolkit. I'm not trying to downplay their importance, but on an ideal dungeon run you don't have to use them once.
---
**Concussion Blow, Disarm, Demoralizing Shout &amp; Shield Bash** \- Each of these are damage mitigation abilities on a conventional dungeon run. Absolutely useful, but nothing to do with group utility. I never claimed that warriors wouldn't take less damage, just that shamans aren't without a toolkit of their own. Yes, Concussion Blow can also be used as an interrupt assuming the mob isn't immune, but that effect is very similar to a Grounding Totem - and the shaman has their Earth Shock to replace Shield Bash (with Earth Shock having half the cooldown as well).
---
**Fear Immunity, Hamstring** \- Fear immunity through Berserker Rage, while certainly useful, isn't without it's drawbacks. You have to be in Berserker Stance to use it in the first place, making it a stance dance timing skill, which is also what Tremor Totem is. Except that the Tremor Totem is group-wide, so it's not only you whose fear is broken, but also for your healer and the rest of the group. For a fear that is randomly cast (i.e. you don't have DBM warning you about it or you don't see a cast bar) Berserker Rage is as good as nonexistant, as you won't be in Berserker Stance when you get feared. Hamstring on the other hand I'm not even sure why you included. I can't think of a single encounter in Vanilla 5mans where it's a useful mechanic for the tank - but even if it is, the shaman isn't without their tools either: Both Earthbind Totem and Frost Shock will do the job that Hamstring would, and unlike Hamstring, an Earthbind Totem is actually useful for AOE situations where you're going to lose aggro to the mage/warlock/whatever no matter what you do.
---
**Thunder Clap &amp; Intimidating Shout** \- Two abilities I believe I've never used on a 5man run. The amount of times you get to charge in to a pack are next to nonexistant and even if you get to do it, 99% of the time you're better off starting out with a demo shout in defensive stance (switch while charging). Intimidating shout along with other fear mechanics are just so situational that you will always need to plan around using them; they're never the solution to "oh shit we suddenly find ourselves in a tight spot".  
---
**Intercept** \- Yep, this is very useful for a warrior. Because a warrior can't do shit if they're not in melee range. Shaman shocks have a 20yd range, which is usually enough to Earth Shock a mob aggroing another target or to Frost Shock a fleeing one.  
---
All in all, most of the abilities you listed are things that either help the warrior keep the mobs on them or help reduce the damage they're taking. I would not consider these utility abilities, as they're abilities that strictly help them do the job they came to do in the first place.
---
Very few people think it's perfect. It *is* the best game ever made and most folks are wise enough to know that you don't tinker with that, especially after they've already seen Blizzard ruin it once. 
---
I‚Äôm really considering playing a paladin in vanilla, the thought of bubble hearthing really gives me a dopamine rush. 
---
No, it obviously has flaws and all, but the experience itself as a whole when accounting for the flaws is incredible and they are part of what make it unique and magical. If people want to play tuned or ‚Äúimproved‚Äù classes they have the option to in retail, but blizzard shouldn‚Äôt try and cater to them in the name of modifying what was vanillla 
---
We want Vanilla as it was.
---
You can play the original Warcraft and Starcraft. You can't play Vanilla WoW. (No, private servers don't count.)
---
It absolutely doesn't matter if it's balanced or unbalanced or whatever. It was a legendary game which is part of gaming (or even general) culture. It should be available to play by anyone at any time.
---
I don't see the real problem here.
---
You know something? :) 
---
A SMALL SEASONED CURLIES.
---
I guess I forgot to put /s
---
If you're not an idiot it's way easier to get a solid group together. I'm talking just some sort of system where you can see who actually is looking for groups, I'm guessing you dont know how cancerous it is trying to get a 40 man group together and lead it. And that argument of no communication is so dumb and overused, you dont grind hundreds of hours the same dungeons and raids looking for a mate, you do it for gear, if you run into a few friendly people here and there that's great but if you get real for 1 sec 99% of these people dont matter outside of that run. If you want social aspects just join a guild that runs stuff together, problem solved
---
I think people will try more things this time around and not be that close minded to try different things, if it doesn't happen then B could change around some numbers, but I prefer if they don't do it until later on in the patch cycle that they showed us. I don't want them making X class broken and then having to change everything again.
---
It's a Tenacious Defender reference
---
&gt; So perfect game?
---
yes
---
So release it up to nax and never touch it again?
---
I liked being able to strafe while walking so I can do the moonwalk and enjoyed the glitches that allowed you to get into Caverns of Time and Mr Hyjal (not sure the last one qualifies as a glitch but there you go).
---
If I roll Pally I‚Äôm going Dwarf. Booze and Jesus yes please. 
---
I never had interest in playing a Warrior - the whole melee archetype just never really interested me in WoW.
---
I skilled up a melee toon in another game that was out prior to WoW, and that was enough for me.
---
Beatiful shots! Thanks!
---
I'm my case it's the latter.
---
nice to know i am not the only one dreaming about this game. lol.
---
And who decides what will be changed? Will they go for Looking for x tool to make people spend less time making their groups and talking? More flight paths and cemeteries because it reduces downtime? Giving unfinished quest zones like Silithus and Blasted Lands some love so you don't have to grind dungs or mobs in open world? 
---
The list is so long and no one knows what might be good or bad in the long run. I'm sure the LFR sounded like a great idea at the start because it does make sense at first glance. Turns out if you let the player see everything without putting any effort, there's usually no point starting after that. You've seen the whole content already, right?
---
My point is, none of us knows shit about how to make classic better and I'm pretty sure current devs don't know either. I'm not looking for perfection or upgrades. I want to enjoy classic for what it was on servers that won't disappear because of legal issues with Activision Blizzard.
---
Analogies need to get their point across rather than be perfect. And nuggets do get the point across
---
If you want a class with a high skill cap you want to play Warlock. It's without a doubt the hardest class to play in pvp, but also one of the absolute best if you master it.
---
Shadow Priest is also very very good in PvP. An SP can obliterate any other class 1v1.
---
I know I‚Äôm a minority here but I‚Äôd like minor class balance to make hybrids less pigeon holed into one spec.  
---
Nice, I've  done this on a Warlock but I never thought to try it with my Druid. I thought the video was longer than it needed to be, unless you are a complete noob at farming lashers.
---
You can also jump down from the normal entrance &amp; there is less chance of pulling agro from the mobs. There will be one pack up top that is missed, though.
---
I had the same idea. Just keep the level cap at 60 and just have us do the TBC content in order to unlock raids and stuff like a long attunment. Make all the gear you get in TBC as good as the gear you get in other level 60 zones while making dungeons require you to do some vanilla raiding in order to complete them. Basically just try to never make old content irrelevant until you‚Äôve actually done it a few times. 
---
They will screw it up the minute they decide they have our permission to make game-play changes (I don't mind pure UI stuff). They've been going in the wrong direction with retail for a decade now. 
---
If they start reworking balance they will do what they've always done and listen 100% to the gimps on the forums that post all day about "rotations", "down time", "apm", "skill cap" etc. The game should be left alone, warts and all.
---
That's funny because I'm constantly doing WPvP. 
---
I like classic but disagree with my post.
---
You don‚Äôt like the current game because of an rng drop mechanic? Well that‚Äôs exactly how the game has always functioned. Just now there is the chance of drop and chance of upgrade.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard actually adds old myths / removed items into wow classic.
---
Ashbringer, bengal tiger, onyxia scale armour, ironforge airport and the like.
---
You made a new account to post this, so you already know the answer. 
---
Usually it's the other way around, early birds try to gouge for extra because there are simply less resources at launch, once the mass hits 60 things usually balance out as more people start farming and selling stuff.
---
McCucks
---
In WSG on the Alliance base there was a place where you could jump up into the sky and run around there. It was really fun to hide the flag and see all the horde try to make the jump. Efter 30min it felt too lame so i stopped.
---
You used to be able to break players out of stealth with your pet. Attack order would not cancel if the player went stealth so your pet would just find them no matter where they went. 
---
I seem to remember pally rogue flagroom defense being pretty strong.
---
No it's not. You get a random chance at loot, you don't get a random chance at 4 McNuggets if you order 4 McNuggets. It's not like ordering at McDonald's at all. It sounds funny and great, but it is a bad analogy.
---
You kill a boss and have a chance to get loot. You also have a smaller chance that, now you got loot, for it to be better than it was before. Titanforging and the like is more akin to having different items on the boss with different probabilities of dropping. People look at it wrong: it's not that you have a chance of your item upgrading, it's that you have X chance of getting an item level A dropping, and a separate chance of item level B dropping. It is the same thing as farming for loot before, just some of the pieces have the same name as other drops you want.
---
For the analogy to be correct, you would have to pay McDonald's, and then the cashier would give you a random menu item. You might hope it's the 4 piece McNuggets, but it might be the Big Mac, it might be fries, hell, it might even be a 20 piece McNuggets. That would be more accurate, but that's not how McDonald's works, so the analogy is flawed.
---
"Some people who aren't me will clear MC in white gear five minutes after launch, so Blizzard isn't allowed to make it harder!!!"
---
The logic is watertight.
---
To be honest: no idea. But I had a lot of love for my Benediction even though it was not my first epic for sure. 
---
So in like 3-5 days the economy will crash as the hardcore players will get to 60 by then. And I'd still be grinding my way through Trisfal Glades with my level 8 Undead Mage.
---
Do you have any money?
---
Is it though? Vanilla was RNG too.., just because you both do a raid or pay the same price doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre both entitled to the same reward or number of McNuggets.
---
Difference is just RNG of merely getting gear, and RNG of getting gear and it being upgraded.
---
Just need balanced weeks is all
---
i also thought this way. but in other games it seems to be the other way around. for example in poe when a league start items cost less currency (equivalent for gold) then later in the season, cause later there is more currency available. so it makes sense to buy a lot in the beginning and dont hort currency. would be interesting to know if this will also be the case in wow.
---
lol I hope lag won't be as bad as it was
---
Titan forging is fine, so long as there is a way to manually do it too. Drop marks after heroic runs or something that you can spend on forging your armour to Titan forge rank. 
---
RNG should be used as a bonus and not a frustration. 
---
Typically I've seen all the top players end up working together like the illuminati where they bank up all the mats and then drip feed it, pretty smart idea tbh.
---
I think it's a core part of pirate server mythology that (a) the only reason pirate WoW seems incredibly easy is because they are so amazingly skilled at it and (b) they are so amazingly skilled absolutely nobody from retail now or ever could possibly compete with them.
---
It will be interesting to see what happens when their 'tude meets a genuinely Blizzlike server and experienced retail players, as opposed to the caricature of retail players the pirate server crowd have made up amongst themselves.
---
Its a road they cant go down because it immediately splits the playerbase. They won't even say anything about spell batching.
---
The real problem is that a majority of players on that server will only be there because the streamer is there. Not really for the sake of playing classic wow.
---
ran fine on a recent pvt server opening
---
People with a "d" in their name need to pierce their nutsack with a pencil. It's true because I just made that up.
---
Yeah this. On a private server too and in a casual guild atm, used to raid hardcore in vanilla so i've done everything many years ago. The guild was stuck on SHazzrah for three nights because people weren't fast enough when he blinked, we wiped on Geddon a few times because people kept blowing up the raid/nobody dispelled the manaburn from the DPS, we couldn't kill golemag because we didn't have enough DPS before healers went oom even though i did golemag 14 years ago with gear fot he dps that was half as good. We are wiping like crazy in BWL atm. The fights aren't mechanicaly difficult but they require 40 people to do their job, if one guy doesn't you very often just wipe.
---
And yeah in PuG raids and 5 mans i have seen som terrible, terrible players. Most people are still pretty bad at the game and that's fine! And that's why everyone won't faceroll through classic.
---
No. Before there is a % drop chance. Now there is a % drop chance, a % chance to forge, a% chance for socket, and a % chance for third stat. You never get the item you want. Because weve got from a 20% chance to a .1% chance. Imagine only .1% mobs drop loot in classic. Yeah youd quit about 100 mobs in because youd get nothing for 1000 mobs.
---
It would not fit in with their episodic crap.
---
South Park, like wow, is not what it used to be.
---
Pretty crappy your SP buddy rolled need on the sword, but I suppose it worked out well in the end.
---
WoW is turning more and more into a Diablo type loot system 
---
Having a bad day?
---
Heres the thing... warforging was pretty great for the game when it was put in during MoP. It gave a small upgrade and gave incentives to reclear farm bosses each week on your way to progress... but then blizzard took it WAY too far... and the nightmare of titanforging now exists.

Vanilla economy is generally pretty heavy, since mounts, skill/plan training and repairs drain what little you get from quests/mobs.
---
Happy reddit birthday 
---
Love that, some of my best drops in vanilla were just from totally random enemies in the world.
---
My first is being born this may.  I figure watching the baby and grinding mobs will be my summer
---
Extra points for priest gear!
---
Blizzard chose the hardest way of recreating Vanilla. They chose to change Vanilla so it fits into the current version of the game rather than change thier infrastructure so it can run the old game. 
---
This makes me worried that Blizzard will screw it up. 
---
I just want to relive Vanilla wow so NOchanges is the perfect ideal for me, flaws be damned. So i guess it is in part all 3 of your suggestions. 
---
That was good timing.
---
People don't like putting their time in something and then have a chance to reap less benefits than someone who barely put any time in at all. You can take the moral high ground and call people horrible all you want, this is just what it is. Good for you if it doesn't bother you; don't assume the same of others. 
---
If you don't play on a pvp realm are still required to hate flying? 
---
I absolutely hated it when damage numbers got so inflated. It just felt.....stupid...for some reason.
---
When I was leveling my Elemental Shaman and hit level 40 I got Elemental Mastery and I figured about when I pushed the skill and casted a Lightning Bolt and spammed Earth Shock right after, both spells always crit! 
---
Felt good
---
Yeah exactly like the real world economy.
---
Oh damn I remember that sword. Really fun to use :D
---
I guess you saw into an alternate universe lol. (or worst case scenario, the actual future in our timeline...)
---
Were gonna need to cancel the last two items on the check!
---
I forgot you couldn‚Äôt duel in cities other than using that trick. Kind of sad if that won‚Äôt be returning :(
---
Nope. I'm just a filthy casul
---
If you have two screens you can always be working during the waits but most important I think is running in windowed fullscreen so alt-tabbing is quikckest üòâ
---
I‚Äôd suggest stealth to make sure you don‚Äôt get caught whilst inside
---
Using this to duel in IF was amazing, they should have left it.
---
That Tanaris pic is OFF THE CHARTS WOW
---
I was part of the Nogg-Aholic community that were pioneers in glitches and exploits in classic WoW. 
---
Besides classic wallwalking to get to places you couldn't get to otherwise like underneath OG/SW, caverns of time or Hyjal we also did modelchanging. Of course I made my rogue wear thunderfury and full T3. 
---
But by changing the model of the campfire to the model of the dark portal you could stack camp fires and reach places like the balcony of Nefarian uninstanced. With some advanced modelchanging you could even change full zones to look cooler or change races. 
---
The most advanced things were even crazier. I remember changing the coordinates of the ships that travel between continents to go to GM Island. Changing the coordinates of the deadmines instance to something called "developers Island" where they did some testing in the alpha and beta. The pinnacle was changing the collision settings of my character to 0 which allowed me to run up every single wall, tree or mountainside no matter how steep it was. 
---
Ironforge airport was just for decoration.
---
Classes are still unbalanced on retail, with more than ten years of experience so...
---
I'd love if they instead of creating the TBC Karazhan we get the planned "Karazhan Crypts". I would like some offspec sets on par with T3 or just some trinkets/Weapons. 
---
I alway though it was the former. It makes it way better 
---
Always have a second window ready to tab to. Also play without music at work. 
---
Hahaha! Just make sure you sap the manager first
---
Not even Chess is flawless and it has existed for thousands of years. There is no such thing as perfect balance.
---
Blizzard tried to balance the game and over the years just about every single aspect of WoW changed and now it's not the same game it used to be. Why restart that whole process?  
---
It's better to accept that maybe WoW's design probably just doesn't allow for something like that to happen.
---
Classic isn't perfect. Then again I've never played a game that's 100% perfect.  
---
But a lot of people enjoy the game for what it is. If it sometimes resembles rock paper scissors, doesn't mean that the disadvantaged class will always lose.
---
Hunters, Rogues and Warriors struggle against Mage. Doesn't mean they can't win. Shamans can explode people on demand. Doesn't mean they're unstoppable. Doesn't mean they can't be killed. Doesn't make them the perfect 1v1 or 1vX class.
---
What people seem to forget is that the whole point of PvP is for two people to engage in combat and at the end only one person gets to walk away alive.  
---
Do I really need the entire game to be changed on a fundamental level, and for what? So I can feel slightly better about losing to class X because my odds of winning vs. class X went up slightly higher than before?  
---
As long as that person didn't just automatically win against me because the game is broken then it's fine.
---
Even in the game of rock paper scissors there are people who are better than others. Should someone who's worse than a grand champion of RPS be able to demand that the game be changed because the champion wins more than they do?
---
Elite mentality
---
I‚Äôve seen it differently. At first no one has gold so everything is cheap. The prices steadily raise with player incomes and level out where you would expect them to. 
---
^this... if worst comes to worst, blind into a vanish would probably do the trick or a gouge at the very least should give enough time to get a head start on running away 
---
You should get help from the local IT team because at my place we can't even install stuff lol.
---
Correction: You made a video on how to farm on private vanilla servers.
---
It'll probably still be valid, but many farming methods are certainly not guaranteed to be viable in Classic due to the way vanilla servers work, but Classic won't.
---
One of the big things about East drop runs is that you can reset the instance with a script, which as far as I know will not be possible in Classic. So if you want out you're taking off your gear and suiciding to get out.
---
Paladins got gun skill but shamans didn't?  I demand that you go back to your nightmare right now and think about Shamans getting bow skills and Spirit Shot.
---
Its quite dangerous. While people can not see your monitor they see your face emotions. And when some1 walks in you will have a sort of shock reaction and also quick alt tabbing will look strange for people because you are not looking at the one who walks in but need 1 sec longer on your screen to alt tab. 
---
Once or twice it can happen. If you do that all the time people will think that you do something strange behind ur monitor. 
---
This guy knows
---
In my experience, everything is cheap because no one has gold to buy overpriced items. Plus people need gold for the deposit on the ah as well. 
---
Prices will slowly inflate as player income increases and typically levels off when prices start to get to where they should be. They may even go a bit higher but stuff will stop selling because no one wants to pay that much for copper bars. 
---
It will work itself out. Just think, at the beginning any one of us could be the richest player in the world and not know it.
---
Blizzard doesn't exist anymore; it has been consumed by a grotesque monster called ActivisionBlizzard. Mine eyes have been opened and I mourn the loss of the Blizzard Entertainment I loved for so many years. F
---
It's a problem in that "the person who spends money on this is stupid" and not in a "this hurts the game" way.
---
Don‚Äôt put that evil on us Ricky Bobby!
---
:D &lt;3
---
It started out with me and my uncle setting up our PCs together so we could binge play. We were so excited for it to launch.
---
Activision: "They're going to love this, trust us"
---
Shaman. It would imply me playing Horde.
---
I kid but in all reality probably Paladin. One of the best fantasy classes, and some of the best looking tier set, but I would just end up being a buff vendor. Meh. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna make my pally Lacroix just to fuck with people a bit more. 
---
Actually it‚Äôs an awesome name cuz pallys make bubbles. What else makes bubbles?
---
It was a dark timeline I saw. We aren't on that path, we're safe.
---
It‚Äôll help him heal better, he‚Äôll have more ***manner***
---
You can start duels there behind that pillar. Rush to the old ironforge gate and get polymorphed in.
---
Druid.  The fantasy has never appealed to me, and I dont like how shapeshifting and stealth mess with my bars.  I know it isn't too much to work around, but that has always been the final straw.
---
this is the reason in so hooked on loot from vanilla and tbc
---
the loot has soul, there is only one untamed blade in vanilla. there are no recolors. the loot pacing is slow.
---
i could get the best titanforged arcano crystal with leech and i would get more excited for the untamed blade.
---
Also available on phones....
---
The joy Shaman‚Äôs burst damage/crits  brings is great. Salute leveling elemental! 
---
Humans are only "better" if you're min maxing to the fullest extent. And to that extent if you're raiding as ret you've already decided you're not too concerned with topping meters. Esp as a paladin, play what you want. If you're gonna pvp at all I would go dwarf cause stoneform is really good. The ~5% dmg increase from human racial isn't gonna mean shit as ret.
---
Yes it did! Thought I was the only one who knew this and didnt talked to anyone about this because I thought Blizz would notice it too :p
---
In real classic . Many paladins did have Guns or at least A gun :P even though they could not shoot them. it was the only thing they could have in their ranged wep slot :P
---
Was at 45/46 for two long minutes, while my brain refused to remember Deadwind Pass, I kept thinking Deadman Pass...
---
Warrior, because I wanna enjoy world pvp pre-60
---
Even if I was minmaxing, the racial wouldn't do shit for the pre-raid bis or even any raidweapon apart from ashkandi pretty much since they're all axes. Thats whats bothering me with all the guides:p
---
I was never 60 in vanilla but had a 29 rogue twink. Killed a guy in front of orgrimmar after he lost a duel.
---
Probably druid, I always found the low level druid experience really dull. Which is a shame because I recently played a friends 60 druid on a pserver and rather enjoyed it, if only I could fight through the low levels.
---
I loved all the exploration exploits. We went to all those places and would spend hours and hours with a group of us. 
---
I would argue that they are the best 5 man tanks , given they have sufficient gear
---
Back in the day, I found almost all raids had one spot reserved for a ret pally.
---
I don't think there is general rule, it's more of, what type of item we are talking about.
---
One thing I don't often see people talk about is the farming capabilities of this class. You can literally solo DME with T1, and you can aoe farm several areas in BRD. Not to mention the more basic stuff like lasher farming/epl farms. And if you can't respec or just don't have the gear you can always heal jump runs and orb runs. Tons of versatility and potential there.
---
I use Remote Desktop on my phone and do crafting or AH stuff. There not enough downtime in my job that I could do anything more. 
---
you just displayed your ignorance.  guilds are for raiding.
---
you can easily get prebis while guildless but you wont be killing KT without a guild.  i have never seen a guild advertise in world about how they run scholo but you will see them tell you what content they have cleared.
---
you clearly havent played much end game.  what raid boss have you gotten up to?
---
There was a quest in Stratholme that required you to use an item called Egan's blaster in your range slot and after handing the quest in you got to keep it. 
---
You could use the item and you would be holding a shotgun type weapon for a few seconds.  Was using it on my druid in its range slot until they added idols for that slot.
---
We did all of those things too, the good old days.
---
Fuckoff realms ... I like the possibilities here.
---
Things don't go below vendor prices. 
---
It is pretty hard to sell much of anything that would have been expensive since ppl are saving gold for mounts. 
---
Prices vary alot cause nobody is farming.
---
If you have gold then you can make some really good deals in the first week if you know what items are valuable. Like Elemental Fire or Pre BIS blues.
---
&gt;Their pvp as a duelist is unmatched.
---
*disagrees in orc SL-lock* 
---
Too bad Hurricane is one of the worst epics in Vanilla
---
Who hasn't been camped? It's part of mmo's.  EQ, WoW, EvE, ESO -- happened at least once for me on each.
---
I can't wait !!...
---
I'm an IT guy.  You need to use a non-work computer and make sure it's connected to a public network and not your work network.  Best bet is a personal laptop that you can put in a drawer or something and have it connected to a public wifi nearby or if you unlimited data hotspot on your phone, maybe use that.  Some companies have a guest wifi that is not part of the Corp network...usually it's just a normal internet router like you would use at home...if your work has that use it.  Get a KVM switch and hook up your work PC and gaming PC/laptop, one monitor and your keyboard and mouse.  then you can switch between work and gaming with quick keyboard shortcuts and use the same equipment that's always on your desk.
---
So everything on your desk looks normal, except that there's a laptop and KVM switch in a drawer hidden, running Wow on a public network that no one will know about.
---
Holy reck is my favorite build and if you get in early enough with a good raid guild you can potentially be the sanctuary pala so no need to respec. You only lose 5% crit change really, still get divine favor &amp; illumination which are the key spells for healing raids. 
---
Ret PvP is okay but I play support so it doesn't sit well with me, I prefer 1 handed holy reck but pocket healing a geared ret is fun. Mostly because I can get counterspelled and not worry about them dying. 
---
Farming gold is easy, dire maul east lasher farm is okay can be 20-25g an hour if you run it right. 
---
Trade your normal office for a home office, and trade your job for welfare.
---
Yet the concept was a trivial one posed by a fool who finds validation in arguing inconsequential points over the internet. Ahh but you wouldn't know how much of an idiot you are because learning isn't a reality for you. 
---
I used to be able to create the model of the Dark Portal stairs. With some tricky text work in game files you could change the skin of a campfire to pretty much any model in the game but only you could see it. And walk on it... I used the Dark Portal stairs to get on top of anything I wanted and thoroughly enjoyed trolling people in cities. 
---
I was a level 36 Tauren hunter in the hinterlands, I have no idea why I was there I was just exploring and I saw an AFK human paladin /sitting by the river... so I done what any hordie would do I loaded my aim shot and actually hit the biggest crit ever around 900 or something and proceeded to kill the helpless pala. RIP good times ;( 
---
This is what i would do aswell.
---
God damn, this was tongue in cheek but you gave a very good, thorough response. Respect. 
---
This isn't Blizzard North. If they make changes, they will absolutely fuck this game up. They already are with right-click reporting and loot trading.
---
Ret isnt a PvE spec so sword/mace skill has little bearing.
---
The reasons people pick human a lot are; diplomacy, RP, Stoneform isnt that great for Paladins. In PvP, its nice for Blind, but Crip is gotten rid of with freedom and everything else with Cleanse. Bleeds dont do a whole lot to a paladim either.
---
I wouldnt say stoneform is "insane" in AQ40. Its ok for bug trio, ok for Huhu given youre not a soak and good for Visc, though most ally guilds just op to skip him most weeks.
---
by lvl 12 you are barely at your 4th fap ofc you arent going to stop so early
---
Maybe - some GMs weren't that knowledgeable, especially in vanilla. I had a GM contact me to re-log &amp; force a name change, because I was using a non-standard character. Even though I re-logged, the GM I was dealing with kept bugging me until I told him that I had, in fact, already re-logged.
---
Great job!  The small details, like the spiderweb, are incredible!
---
In wpvp, rogue will always get the jump on you. 1-59 rogue will always blow you up. At 60 once lock gets decent HP gear he can make it more of a brawl. But assuming equal gear a rogue still has the toolkit to win if all CDs are up.
---
that doesnt make any sense.
---
two people playing classic wow for the same amount of time will not always have the same gear from it.  
---
someone who played less might get lucky with drops and out gear someone who plays more
---
Game could be even better then it was, but people just want their dose of crack back tbh
---
Vanilla isnt perfect looking from today's perspective, but still is the best mmprpg of all time. Then they've made expansions. Some additions were really good, but more of them (especially from TotC patch on) made the game garbage we have today
---
I know I would enjoy vanilla more with some tweaks, but that isn't going to happen and tbh the game is just good enough as it was for me. But is it going to be good enough for audience big enough to make Azeroth feel alive and for people to be interested in longer term? Idk
---
You lack the fundamental knowledge, let alone the technical knowledge, it's probably a waste of time to explain everything to you. For example:
---
&gt;Yes it will be tied to the retail subscription, but lets be honest most of the people that will ‚ÄúJust try it out‚Äù will be gone before lvl 20.
---
That's exactly the point of sharding the starter zones and nothing else. You seem to lack even a basic knowledge of why things are going on.
---
I recommend the follow up, [Illegal Danish: Escape from Ogrimmar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8h1chd0Dfw) and he has many other good shorter videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL840BA2AADF7F06A7
---
When Nost/Elys/LB/ND launched, stuff was pretty cheap for quite a while.  I remember being able to buy green low level gear (lvl10-20 ish) for 10-20s, even if it was eagle/monkey etc...
---
Now I created a new toon on ND just for fun and Eagle/Monkey greens at level 15 are 1-8 gold!  No one at that level has that much gold.  Only people bank rolling alts with lvl 60s have that kind of cash.  
---
So the economy will  start low and slow, but once alot of people have max level toons, it will go up alot because the assumption is "get gold on your 60 and buy your alt stuff".
---
&gt; someone who played less might get lucky with drops and out gear someone who plays more
---
Exactly, this is just "I'm ok with one kind of RNG but not another". You can kill a boss 50 times and never see that trinket you want, and some new player in greens can kill the same boss once and get it on their first try. 
---
Private server, but insanely fun. In the draenei starting area was a quest to catch fish with a net, each use gave you 1 quest item and spawned 1 lvl 5 murloc to attack you. Took that item on my human rogue, went to the starting area and spawned douzens of murlocs while stealthed to murder everything and everyone, guards, players anything. No cd on the item.
---
I had a dream they gave us a release date.... never mind.
---
Sticky this shit
---
Obviously everyone was too stupid back then, not like today
---
You could jump right before you pressed the button "Logout" out and then your character would hang 10 seconds up in the air, that was fun.
---
Also as a paladin you could jump from somewere really high and then use your divine shield to stop you mid air. That's how I jumped the gate from Ironforge back in the day, we went up as a group and all jump down.
---
Fun times!
---
Does anyone still have one of these from Retail Vanilla that is in their current retail bank?  Like one that is truly 12+ years old?
---
Looking for group? 
---
So, you gave up on trying to make a point and just deciding to be insulting?  Thanks for acknowledging I'm correct in your backwards way.
---
Probably Paladin or warlock. Although I'm going to give warlock a try finally in classic.
---
Make epics epic again!
---
So what you are saying is this isn‚Äôt the darkest timeline? Does Abed know?
---
My most favourite place to chill and kill stuff in vanilla was easily WSG (once it was released).
---
Being in the top progression guild on the server as a Hunter, I two-shot most alliance players.
---
You can actually save groups a lot with a rogue. Of course you named Sap, but you can also vanish and re-sap it, blind adds, gouge adds, kick spells, kidney shot spells and even evasion tank for a bit if the tank dies.
---
If everything is going smooth, then you just help by doing the most dps.
---
Popculture is stupid, that is how.
---
Who hurt you guys? I‚Äôm finding lots of nice genuine people who just want to enjoy the game as alliance in a pserv. 
---
Lmaoooo
---
I think it would be awesome. It'd have to be even harder than Atiesh and more expensive than Thunderfury though. 
---
In WoW Classic it‚Äôs more like : 
---
You died 27 times on your way going to Macdonald. 
---
Finally you had to ask 19 times 4 nuggets to the guy to receive only one nuggets. 
---
Vanilla questing was wonderful, I miss it. 
---
In ogrimmar, I found a way to get out of the map in the valley of honor. The out of map glitch lead below the city where there is a massive expanse or flat ground. I once got caught by a blizz gm and when he told me I wasn‚Äôt supposed to go down there I just said sorry and hearthed back.
---
all 3, in that order.
---
Most people I meet are adults with families who want to play casual.
---
I was doing exactly what IT guy said, cause I'm also an IT guy.
---
But if they obviously have the money and are willing to spend it (both sides are happy) I dont see the issue. If the issue is sniping unoriginal "og" names then be more original
---
The first step is admitting you have a problem.
---
Okay, let's just get this out there. There's nothing wrong with the devs at Blizzard, the devs are doing a great job. Not to mention the new classic devs.. watch the classic panel with the new devs and you can really tell that they are great, nerdy people. It's almost like seeing the old Blizzard team from 2005 again.
---
The problem is the leadership telling the devs what to do, devs are just doing what they are told to do and should never get the blame for the state of the game.
---
"I think Leeroy needs those devout shoulders"
---
"Isnt he a paladin"
---
Literally the first 10 seconds, thanks for confirming that you dont listen. Thats a 50dkp minus. 
---
I'm totally down!
---
Anyone else interested in a Moms and Dads casual guild? Gotta pick a name and a server I suppose. I'm torn between a PvP and PvE. Suggestions welcome.
---
Bengal tiger pleaseeeee. Would kill to ride this around even if I had to grind out tiger riding skill 
---
Swifty clearly has no idea what he is talking about. He clearly hasn‚Äôt done any research. Swifty is awesome but all I saw here was wild speculation only people who believe what they are told by someone who also hasn‚Äôt done any research believe. 
---
flipside of that is you can sell your green for the high prices and its likely someone with an alt will buy it.  easy gold.
---
Agreed. I think he‚Äôs probably too busy with streaming and all that to stay up to date. He shouldn‚Äôt listen to his chat though. As soon as he listened to the guy who gave him a release date the video was pretty much over.
---
Likewise. I had a buddy who loved to find these and always brought us along when he did.
---
You mean besides Mind Control, Mana Burn, offensive dispels, silence, power infusion, spirit/Stam/shadow-resist buffs, fear, abolish poison (over time), HoT, little heal, big heal, bubble to avoid pushback, Vampiric Embrace for offensive heals, and one of the nastiest DoTs in the game?
---
I mean this example would be more like a guy ordered, got his order perfectly made with a little extra because why not, and then even though you didn't buy anything mcdonalds tossed you a cheeseburger because they felt like it.
---
In vanilla only one of those two guys would've gotten a cheeseburger because mcdonalds would've only made one, then made them decide who got that single cheeseburger.
---
I dislike a lot about retail wow, I don't even play it, but don't act like vanilla is superior *because* of how loot worked. Retail WoWs loot system does suck, but it's not inherently worse than vanilla wow. I don't like "welfare epics" but this is the least of retails problems, let's be real.
---
Give the name leeroy to whatever random class/race combo pops up then go back and make a pally later.  
---
This is one of the classes I want to love, I really do...but the shift CD and expensive mana cost to shift, the OKish healing and tanking and no OOC Rez is rough. 
---
Just roll on another server then, problem solved.
---
Yeah, but in vanilla, once you got that perditions blade, you were finished with rag loot. You could help run people through MC still, but you didn't need anymore. That meant you had reached a new level of progress.  
---
Now there's always a reason to keep running raids. Maybe next time your "bis" item will titanforge higher than the one you already have. 
---
So you are never "done". There's always an improvement to farm for, though the drop probability goes down drastically.   
---
Awful ui
---
They can't use 2h Maces either anymore.
---
Look at all those god damn cows. I love it
---
Going behind the right pillar next to IF bank to get into old IF was cool times
---
I'm sorry, but a noob in greens will never have enough DKP to win that trinket over you if you've killed it 50 times. RIP DKP.
---
Holy shit. First, you don‚Äôt spec shadow until 40 when you get shadow form. You spec into spirit tap and wands and wear as much spirit gear as you can get. Obey the 5 sec rule and keep the best wand you can. Fronts load your dmg and wand to death. You take tap, wand, and holy Crit and cast time until 40 then respec shadow and go back to disc for wands and if you do all this PRIEST IS EASY to level. Albeit a bit boring until shadow.  Wet smooth leveling actually and you HEAL JUST FINE in instances up to 60.
---
All I know is :
---
Low level herbs and skins are dirt cheap. Like barely above vendor price, so sometimes people are even losing out from deposit costs. They go as low as a few copper to maybe a couple silver. This is because there is a huge influx of supply with zero to little demand. 
---
Rare shop patterns you might snag walking past the vendor will be near unsellable for at least a week, as there is just no one that is willing to spend a reasonable amount on them. 
---
Certain Quest required mats or craftables will be much higher in the first month, more specifically the first week, such as copper tube for the Darkshire quest, or whatever is the horde alternative. 
---
Cloth will always pretty much be in demand because people tend to rush level Tailoring, while also needing it for first aid, so there will be a market for linen+ from day one on. 
---
Although this is just experience from playing on pserver launches, I couldn‚Äôt imagine classic being much different. 
---
They got the new breakfast Hotpocket‚Ñ¢- OH GOOD.  Now I can have a Hotpocket‚Ñ¢ for breakfast, a Hotpocket‚Ñ¢ for lunch, and be dead by dinner.
---
&gt;Deeeaaattth poooockeettss‚Ñ¢!
---
Barrens rock
---
For real. Lots of people like *this guy* have their worst day every day, and try to argue their point across by taking others down. 
---
Probably never - it's still in my bank today in retail.
---
Getting out of WSG once you enter by essentially just ping over the gate down the inner path. Afaik you needed to be a mage and blink first into it, then you could hop up and over, was fun capping the flag 10 secs after the game started :)also getting on top of IF as a mage with slow fall was a fun one ^^
---
holy hell what? I ve never heard of this. Do you have any proof or a pointer to this exploit? Appreciate it x
---
This is called variable ratio schedule reinforcement and it's incredibly exploitative of the human psyche.
---
So everyone knows if you want to train your dog to sit on command you give it a treat after it sits right to reinforce the behavior. The problem with this is that once your dog is no longer hungry it has no reason to listen to your command to sit any longer.
---
What works better is to only reward your dog sometimes after it sits. This needs to be completely at random and not following any patterns your dog can recognize. It's basically why gambling is so addictive. 
---
Really? For what exactly? Sanctity Aura only increases holy damage and Judgement of Light doesn‚Äôt really heal enough to justify the debuff slot.
---
Nice! I could imagine ‚Äúuhh I took a wrong turn?‚Äù Lol! 
---
Haha, sounds like that‚Äôd be fun to go /dance  and or /flex at the opposing enemies gate
---
And a filet of fish sandwich, because it's less calories because it's fish, because I'm trying to watch my figure.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't even bother with mana spring tbh, just spent more time drinking as they initiate the pull. They shouldn't need a heal within the first 10 seconds or so.
---
And the only totem that really makes an impact during trash pulls are things like windfury, grounding, earth bind, or tremor. And even then, the earth totem's are optional, so its really just WF totem upkeep and heals.
---
MOAR DOTS!!!
---
Them sweet purps man. I still remember the night I got my devout shoulders. Such a proud moment when the roll Gods smiled upon me 
---
It is actually more like a bad windfury proc.
---
Its a butterfly effect.  Maybe they tweak paladins and prot is viable and everyone is happy and cheers blizzard and goes on their merry way.  Or, maybe it changes the game in unforseen ways and diminishes the vanilla experience in some ways.  I look at it like we KNOW we like vanilla as it was, so just give us vanilla.  Most classes have a underwhelming or even useless spec from a meta prospective.  I played a paladin in vanilla and had a blast.  NO CHANGES.
---
In the help/gm tab there was briefly an auto unstuck feature. Normally it would make you cast hearthstone, BUT if hearth was on CD it would punt you up and in the direction you were looking. There were lots of cool places you could get with it, like on the auctioneer podium in iron forge that is invisibly walled off.
---
A lot of ‚Äúweeee‚Äù moments XD
---
&gt;talent stick
---
Lulz
---
ITT: People don't know who Swifty is/has done in Vanilla.
---
He said that there SHOULD only be that one boss or vein, there shouldn't be 2 kazzaks on different shards. He's just trying to prove that he knows sharding isn't welcome here
---
I love the rock/paper/scissor aspect of old wow.  I knew on my shadow priest i would massacre any warrior i found because i had armor stacked crazy high but id lose to geared enh shamans because theyd purge my shield/renew.  Why does everything have to be balanced?  There was no class who had 0 purpose, everyone had a place in the game.
---
I can blink inside the Stormwin bank and pretent to be the banker
---
But but reeee
---
wow
---
It took a long time to level professions in vanilla so I‚Äôd level herb/alchemy skinning/leather etc at the same time 
---
Really cool! Do my female NE druid next ;)
---
Pretty sure I'll vendor it
---
why are female tauren so underrated?
---
damn adorable
---
Put a 3M screen filter on. Then noone can see your screen from an angle, only facing directly. 
---
This could help if someone comes and you dont have enough time to alt-tab
---
I remember doing this in WSG to get on top of the bases and behind the walls. Model editing was fun back in the day before they got efficient at banning for it. 
---
It's been LONG since patched but you could probably find it by searching Campfire Edit/Glitch or something similar. 
---
The wait is killing me.  I‚Äôm having dreams of vanilla but they are happy ones.  I dreamed the crocs in stv were elite red cons, and I was fear kiting them with my gnome warlock.  
---
I also dreamed about the first silver named I killed and it dropped a blue.  
---
I am concerned that this will continue for another year or more.  
---
I need classic to come along and cancel my EQ subs for the second time.  The irony.  
---
So true and the source of much drama
---
Eye of Flame dropped while I was leveling in Alterac on my mage. Held onto that baby until I could equip it, it was my main motivation to hit whatever level I needed to equip it (50 something I think).
---
I can't believe you have to plop your logs one at a time. I never realized this wasn't part of classic. That would be pretty frustrating.
---
If you have a non-gathering profession then you could make things to help make leveling easier, alchemy with potions, leather working with leather armor, etc
---
Follow up, I will go tailor/chant for a mage. If I roll hunter, is engineering ideal?
---
Maybe they're thinking of when the 31 point talent in ret was Kings.
---
im leveling my warlock as tailoring enchanting, then at 60 tailoring herb, then tailoring engineering.
---
the idea here is to use tailoring to craft myself bags and maybe some shadowweave / felcloth gear for a little bump &amp; since ill want to run tailoring once ZG hits. 
---
my guild wants to raid MC within the first two weeks, and i'd like to get some of us enchanted sooner than later so i'll level up as enchanting to nab a few skill-ups on my way to 60.
---
once I'm 60 i'll begin farming BRD for large brilliant shards, once i get enough of them i'll drop enchanting for herbalism.
---
here i can begin grinding out as many herbs as i'll need for the next month before leveling a mining/herbalism alt and drop herbalism on my warlock for engineering, running my herbs through the guild alchemist.
---
Dude if you go into Classic with the attitude of obtaining BiS from the get-go, you're in for a loooooong ride. I'd suggest smaller steps, like "What's the best sword I can have for my spec at 39?"
---
Unlike retail, guys with full BiS setups are going to be &lt;1% of the population.
---
Yep, the comparison sounds cute at first...but then you realize you can flip it around the other way....which makes it utterly meaningless: 
---
You show up, put in the same effort, and walk away empty handed while the other guy gets his BIS piece....week after week after week after week.   
---
BWL (AQ20/ZG) in Vanilla (I took a break after) and BT/Hyal in TBC, you? For example we met our future main tank in 5 man dungeons and then proceeded to run dungeons with the guy to get him enough gear so he can raid. Nobody advertised that but dungeons just were you know, *relevant* for guilds. Not to mention attunements/keys. Even the fastest, most hardcore guilds will first run 5mans *together* until they are prepared for t1 content. And casual/mediocre guilds constantly need an in-flow of players which they sometimes get through dungeon content (depending on raid status).
---
At this point I'am just going to assume you are a troll though, because these things are super, super obvious and anyone who played the game knows them. So have a good time.
---
Mage.
---
I get that it's probably one of the best designed overall classes in vanilla. I've gotten high enough to know the joy that is being able to portal yourself around. I've watched the pvp videos and seen the skill cap.
---
However my main I went the furthest with during live was a warlock, I didn't try mage until I'd had many days played sunk into my warlock. The two classes kinda fit into the same bin of damaging doing caster, yet play so differently that every time I'm playing mage, I just wish I was playing my warlock.
---
That, and the cadence of mage play (murder, drink, murder, drink) drives me insane.
---
That is a massive factor that the no change REEtards never take into consideration.
---
If I'm a balance druid (or any other bad spec), I'm going to have WAY more fun getting into class fantasy if the future is unknown and I look forward to some day maybe being awesome.  If I know from the moment I roll exactly where the spec lands in the hierarchy, then it's pretty damn tough to get motivated and excited about leveling a bottom tier character. 
---
Priest. I just find it to be the least interesting class. Even though Shadow Priest are kinda OP in PvP, I would never play one.
---
Yeah not the worst comparison but a few notes
---
Mortal strike hits harder (weapon damage +x) and crits harder with impale talent.  
---
Mortal strike is on command (controlled burst) so you can intentionally use it when you want it rather than crossing dem fingers. 
---
But SOC is better in some ways-
---
Holy damage bypasses armor and basically never gets resisted
---
Lower resource cost assuming 'rage starved'- the mana for seals is basically irrelevant unless you're getting spam mana-burned by a priest. 
---
Available much earlier (level 20 vs level 40)
---
I once got permanent Presence of Mind instant cast on my mage in a UD Strat run. Was fun instant fireballing everything dead in 3-4 hits. That was until we hit the second boss and she mind controlled me and I proceeded to wreck our group and kill everyone with my god mode buff. Whoops.
---
Yeah but by adding variations of each item, when it finally DOES drop, if it doesn't titanforge then you are fucked and need to keep doing it anyway if you want to be BiS. The RNG is so much more narrow for no real payoff. It's the same concept of why LFR gear is stupid. Worse versions of gear just cheapen it across the board.
---
Ret PVP *IS* support.  If you just charge in like a warrior you will get blown up and don't do enough damage.  Hang back from the front line a bit, drop a couple cleanses and bof, help keep people out of trouble, and punish people who get too close to healers/casters.  
---
Flash won't necessarily save someone's life but it is an extremely efficient way to keep a group topped up during/between engagements. 
---
The economy at vanilla was pretty much as folks here are describing.  But no one knew what anything was really worth.  You are going to outgrow most greens and even blues pretty fast.  Once the gold farmers hit lvl 60 it changed.  On my server, you couldn‚Äôt farm felcloth or farm arcane shards cus the rogues had those camped.  Once people could buy gold it went crazy, and with all the nerfs and exploits what was worth 500g one day would be enchanting mats the next.  My guess is the guys on ps probably know better than the vanilla peeps how it will go.  
---
Yeah this was a bad analogy. But Titanforging is still a vastly more frustrating system than normal loot RNG.
---
Casual LFR raiders are getting higher ilvl gear than what drops from the *mythic raid's final boss* just by running +7 mythic dungeons, because of titanforging.
---
Don't tell OP what his favorite ice cream flavor should be. Let him like  what he likes.
---
I picked my character while I was buying the game at Best Buy. I ended up browsing through the bestiary they were selling right next the game, which got me hyped for the hunter class and all the cool creatures you could tame. That bestiary had all that awesome blizz artwork
---
Pet following even when the target stealths is still a thing in 1.12.1 and will be in classic.
---
This guy is aware of the other guys knowledge.  
---
You could try in the mage classic discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/QyevcaD
---
There was also a cheeta looking mount in the alpha iirc.  And I remember the website before launch described weapon colors and after orange there was going to be a red.  I dreamed of finding a red someday, but alas :(
---
No, the greens I get are always +spirit that sell for vendor price +2 copper on AH
---
i had an imp named rulnip üò©
---
Oh duuuuude
---
Score!
---
Probably Rank 14 gear with a few AQ40 and Naxx pieces.
---
That‚Äôs end game, what about during stage 1?
---
It's almost like I know from experience....  :)
---
https://www.barrens.chat/index.php?f=7
---
I didn't know there was a server cap?
---
If you delete all of your characters, though, you should free up that limit.
---
I used to love getting on My undead mage and getting on top of iron forge then ganking the noobs inside the city
---
Yes.  There have been plenty of breadcrumb quests that I haven't been able to do because I did the quest it chains to.
---
My son was 4 when vanilla dropped.  He learned to add and subtract sitting on my lap while I collected cactus apples.  Gonna do it with the grandkids this time around.
---
Doing a great job? Have you seen BFA?
---
Are activision telling them to make the game shit on purpose, so everyone quits?
---
No changes.
---
Engineering is ideal for every class that wants to PVP and not bad for a hunter as you can craft your own scopes and I guess bullets.
---
The biggest clue we have is outland. We need someone with the actual blade equipped to visit EVERYWHERE in outland. Hopefully Blizzard releases that bc server with transfers.
---
You can also buy them with the gold you make from dual gathering.
---
Most of the items will be cheap, since people will have 20 of them in their bag and will sell them for around vendor cost just to get rid of them.
---
With dual gathering it's worth remembering you can't track herb/mining at once and to be honest I can't see skinning as profitable on a fresh server since loads of people will take it and you'll end up vendoring leather for some time.
---
I'm taking mining/tailoring on my warlock and herbalism/engineering on my rogue. I was going to take skinning on the rogue then drop if for engineering at 60 but skinning won't give much gold and engineering has some cool stuff to use while levelling.
---
skinning + Mining/or/Herb = the best combo (unless you are cloth wearer then tailoring is Best)  
---
if you pick mining+herb play a druid or hunter because you won't get all the nodes if you don't go fastah 
---
Before the PVP gear? Probably just whatever deals damage and has stamina. Pve and PVP gear is pretty similar for mages. 
---
If you are serious about leveling and getting to 60, this is generally a waste of time. Go dual gatherer and stack gold on your journey to 60, buying what you need along the way.
---
**While leveling:**
---
Fastest - no gathering, don't hold yourself back on the way to 60
---
Easiest - dual gathering, as you get a bunch of gold
---
Min/max - crafting profession + appropriate gathering source (or tailor + enchant)
---
Already Super Rich on your Main - dual crafting
---
Personally, I'm going to either go dual gathering or go mining/engineering on all my characters.
---
Again, you're talking about devs here. Developers are working on the game, they have never been decision makers because that's not their job. They get guidelines, a timetable and resources from the top and starts developing the game accordingly.
---
It's not like Bob the world design dev can make changes without asking someone above him first. That's not how it works
---
Awesome.
---
Dont run engineering while leveling, you can level it up easily once you are 60 and it doesnt bring anything that much useful while you are leveling. Just do skinning and lw or another gathering prof.
---
You say things like you would never use taunt in a ideal dungeon run. What utility would a shaman actually use in an "ideal" run? Certainly not his res or reincarnate. 
---
* Don't use sound.  Headphones are tempting, but then you don't hear when someone sneaks into your office.
---
* Don't make sound.  Screaming "god\*\*\*\*it you \*\*\*\*ing \*\*\*\*, piece of \*\*\*\* just go die for \*\*\*\*'s sake" is not only unprofessional, but also says something strange is going on in your office and will draw attention to you.
---
* Don't get involved in group content where you will have to abandon your group in the middle of a run to deal with actual work
---
* Don't neglect your actual work to the point you get audited
---
So does anyone remember how reck worked in vanilla, because some have said that it will not work the same way in classic as it did in private servers?
---
Holy reck really seems fun, i could heal and i could also do some dmg at times. Mainly when i do solo stuff.
---
You gotta be willing to die at any time.  Also, if someone walks in, you just say wait a moment...just let me hit send on this email...and what you're really doing is minimizing WoW, or switching to your work PC or whatever.  You have to have the mindset to not act surprised and stuff when someone comes in.
---
Imagine you kill a boss and one guy gets loot but not the other guy. Same work man!
---
Lots of places let you work from home.
---
I know a couple that moved halfway across the country because they didn't like the politics of the state they lived in.  Their employers both said "you can work from home, so I don't care where you live as long as you can log in."
---
There is a famous example of a guild doing this to skip all of the bosses in AQ40 to get straight to C'Thun.  They edited some stairs into something small and were able to get to him immediately.  They were eventually caught and all involved get permabanned.
---
Yeah, I'd say probably BiS raiding items with some engineering stuff. Early in the game few are 55+ and fewer have good raiding gear, so having that and max lvl engineering puts you way in front of the pack
---
I was briefly working on a ele shaman PvP BIS list that had a priority of mail and leather other the "PvE" BiS list that has garbage like all cloth and an offhand instead of a shield.
---
Stage 1 is harder to work with, because a lot of the gear is from DM, Ony and MC.
---
I was doing 2 variants, one with raid gear (MC/Ony) and one without.
---
Someone else mentioned the flat ground beneath orgrimmar. In that location there was some missing textures that would let you fall through the world.  
---
If you slowfalled at a certain angle through the hole you'd end up in the Stormwind mage tower (and promptly die). 
---
For rogues, Shadowpanther has brought back [shadowpanther.net](https://shadowpanther.net) and I've got my gear planned from levelling gear to endgame gear (which, as I won't raid, will be a mix of BoE, quest and PVP items). Shadowpanther is a wonderful human being. 
---
I remember during the original AQ War Supply event (which lasted if I remember correctly for several weeks back in Vanilla) discovering some humans in Westfall along the ocean that were bugged out with something like a 10 second respawn. I played Horde but somehow discovered these guys. I farmed so much Linen cloth it was ridiculous.
---
&gt;guys with full BiS setups in Classic are going to be &lt;1% of the population
---
And hopefully they'll be too busy raiding to take part in wPVP and BGs!
---
It would be a good practice but I feel fem NE are overused.
---
Shamans can use 2h maces, Sulfuras is every shaman's aspiration, provided the warrior isn't the GM's favourite.
---
Probably because they're female cows. Also their eyelids were closed in the player frame
---
Just use parsec and stream from your home PC. It's super easy and works really well for WoW. Very low latency.
---
I like your point about trinkets. It's interesting that trinkets and various consumables are a huge part of lvl 60 play but don't really turn up as much in the leveling experience unless you're an engineer. 
---
On more recently playthroughs I've started trying to incorporate many of the on-click items into my key binds. Trying to utilize quest rewards like the really sticky glue, waxy candle, makes you get ready to have key binds for your pvp trinket, baron peasant caller, etc.
---
That you could bug mobs out inside doorways and they would stop casting spells and just melee, you couldn‚Äôt hit them with spells either, but we used this to exploit our first ebonroc kill before he was tauntable. 
---
No he said "anymore." Enhancement Shamans in retail can equip a 2 hander, but are denied basically every attack they have outside of a shock or Lightning Bolt.
---
Did someone say "Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker"?
---
What are the min/max for a hunter?
---
Alot of this is heavily downplaying the warrior abilities. I use intimidating shout every time we kill Krom crush in DM N. Shield bash locks enemies out of a spell school for 6 seconds. Mobility is more utility than a ranged threat gen ability. You can still immune random fears. Just get a threat lead and sit in zerker stance. What even does a random fear in a 5 man?
---
You could pop into Moonkin form do do Hurricane, but you will still need to come out &amp; then drop into Bear form to swipe. I don't think you would have enough mana to single-target everything with Moonfire spam &amp; still live. Also, I'm not certain if you hit Barkskin that it wouldn't be removed the moment you go into Moonkin form. (Or whether you can cast Barkskin in Moonkin form?) You would be taking some damage when switching out of Moonkin &amp; into Bear, which takes a couple of GCDs and also consumes some mana (although less if you have the Natural Shapeshifter talent.) So I'm not sure that it's worth it.
---
I love this! I really like how the horse's flesh is rotting away to reveal it's skull/horns. Brutal.
---
In vanilla I was in charge of our guilds MC runs where we'd reserve T2 legs from rag and fill half the raid with pugs to keep running it all the way until BC. In all that time my guild was a little unique in that we never had the right binding of the windseeker drop even though we had 9 left bindings. We also never had a single bloodfang chest piece drop off of Nef. Any RNG can be a bitch.
---
Yeah I enjoyed that quite a bit.
---
I want to play a mage focused on pvp, what's the best way to go for professions? I understand engie/mining to 60, but then what? Do I drop mining and go for ench? Tailoring? Alch? 
---
In Moonkin form you can only cast spells from the Balance tree.
---
Could be a 20 man raid to correspond with the Nax release. One of the biggest missteps of 1.11 IMO was the lack of such content. They had set up such a nice parallel progression in ZG -&gt; AQ20 -&gt; (missing raid here) that might have allowed for more smaller casual guilds to have value while still not stepping on the toes content-wise and gear-wise of the more hardcore raiders.
---
There are many reasons I am "no changes".
---
1. There are many changes I'd actually like to see.  But I can't justify my changes while also putting down your changes (without being either arrogant or a hypocrite).  So if I don't want all the other changes that are suggested, I can't justify mine.
---
2. A lot of the changes that are suggested are fixed by addons.
---
3. A lot of the changes that are suggested as "minor changes" are anything but.  (I.e. "we need 3 minor changes: re-order characters on character select screen, toggle auto-loot, and we need to allow flying mounts).
---
4. We've seen the effects that too many changes have had on the game.
---
5. Blizzard would probably screw it up (this is the company that screwed up live).
---
6. Activision would probably screw it up and use changes to introduce "market standard" features like cash shops.
---
7. Part of the reason for Classic to exist is as a snapshot in time of what WoW Classic was, especially after the launch of Cataclysm.  (So in this case the answer is literally "nostalgia")
---
8. A lot of the changes players ask for are things which are done in TBC.  I've literally seen people ask for better class balance, for Paladins to be effective tanks, for Kara and ZA to be released, for Alliance to get Shamans and Horde to get Paladins...but who don't want TBC.  It's just strange to me.  In my case, the majority of the changes I want are fixed by TBC launching.
---
9. A community vote means those that want changes will vote for changes, and those that are happy with the game won't be on forums discussing changes.  Kind of like how customer support ratings are skewed because most people only rate the support when it's bad.
---
Mage'n my way on top of the Auctioneer stand in Org by far.  Then proceeding to Picollo and AE well everywhere
---
Really sticky glue. Those r great for stv. 
---
Yeah and I'm honestly thinking I may not ever make it far enough for locks to outpace hunters. My impression is hunters are great through T2 but fall off in AQ40 / Naxx. I may play and get through BWL and that be it.
---
Why does it need tuning?
---
Paladin is tons of fun.  You can heal.  You can tank if your group cooperates, and in some dungeons it's going to go faster with a Paladin.  You are amazing in PvP and you rarely die in solo play.
---
Just because it's not min/maxed for damage in raids, doesn't mean it's a useless class.
---
Reset the instance is not the same thing as logging out to get to the entrance. If #nochanges then both of these should still work, as far as I know.
---
I would not recommend this on a new server. The economy is going to be jacked until it settles and those stacks of copper/light leather are going to be worth a mere pittance of their value later. 
---
Also remember in Classic there are quite a few BoP items that are made by professions and are well before level 60. Specifically Engineering items, BSmithing has the anti-fear trinket, Heart of the Mountain, etc.
---
Some of the worst changes for me have been pure UI stuff.
---
* The way white damage is displayed on live is horrible
---
* Quest Helper being standard
---
Love the Arcanite Reaper in the back 
---
No I am assuming he is delegating accountability. I have just run 40 man guilds before. To say it's a head ache is an understatement. You are dealing with 40 people who all think they are going to get loot. As 40 pieces won't drop you see the problem. As far as their not being enough room for everyone to be baker. Thats fine just don't expect to get the choicest slice of cake.
---
I just don't understand if you want a legendary start a successful guild. Thats how most people get them. No guild leader who isn't a fop is going to pass on the legendary to give it to someone else. You can't expect someone to take on the reins of leading 40 people and not take the reward for it.
---
Careful with that bis list, its wrong with the raid gearing section. He‚Äôs using 18% hit (2% over hit cap) in BWL and running t3 6p in nax (which sucks). 
---
As someone that is likely maining Enh in Classic (leveling one on pserver atm), I'll just use staves anyway üòàüòà
---
I don't know.  It's definitely in my top 5, but for me it's at least topped by the original Descent and America's Army.
---
Oh yeah, its all the big boogeyman activision that are the true devs, the actual blizzard people are all amazing, and everything bad comes from Activision.
---
Who are the devs btw if they are not designing the fucking game.
---
Blizzard is dogshit, and the devs makes the game decisions. You can say activision wanted the game to be more casual,but again Blizzard has stated multiple times that they are in-control of game design.
---
I honestly wish they'd have kept the old seal and judgement style of gameplay, but still made a lot of the changes they made in WotLK.  It took Paladins from being a unique class to being a warrior with more glowy effects.
---
The difference is that in Private servers you can /sit to get it to proc, and in live servers you couldn't do that.
---
Just to clarify, other players don't see it. They would just see you floating in the air. All you do is change what model is referenced when drawing a campfire. 
---
I saw someone refer to it as Seal of Casino.  
---
&gt;we never had the right binding of the windseeker drop even though we had 9 left bindings
---
*yowza intensifies*
---
If you are retribution and DPSing a dungeon or raid, what are some things you can do between judgments so you're not just waiting to judge again?
---
Obviously without wasting too much mana.
---
I‚Äôm very torn between alliance and horde.
---
I‚Äôve always been an alliance player in my youth. I want to be a priest; I‚Äôve been thinking of undead priest instead of the alliance race struggle.
---
However on Reddit specifically, I‚Äôve seen a lot of toxic behavior from alliance-bashers and I really haven‚Äôt read any the opposite. This has pretty much turned me off from horde. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to generalize a player base but I‚Äôm not seeing a lot of human decency from this side online (calling these well-meaning people who merely roll alliance fat, underaged, mentally challenged). Are these just a vocal monitory?
---
Glorious and hunterly story, 10/10!
---
Doh your post has just reminded me I've forgotten about Magic Dust! Luckily there are a few keys left :)
---
look at all those god damn skills. i love it :D
---
smallest deadzone of all classes with deadzones :D
---
I'd definitely put **Leatherworking** up at the top, because it's the profession that makes quivers, and a ton of your gear.  Melee weapon isn't nearly as important to a hunter as ranged weapon, so Blacksmithing is barely useful at all.  I also don't think enchanting is nearly as useful at low levels as it would be on a melee or caster, and Tailoring isn't going to give you any of the armor you need.
---
However, **alchemy** will give you potions, which I use quite a bit (especially mana potions to keep healing my pet), and **engineering** will give you more tools to use for CC and to get out of the deadzone.  An engineering hunter with jumper cables can feign death on a wipe and then rez the healer, who can rez everyone else.
---
Overall, I'd probably say:
---
1. Engineering
---
2. Leatherworking
---
3. Alchemy
---
In that particular order.
---
i thought that too. now im playing a hunter on a private server and tbh once u got it on friendship lvl 6 its just like super chill. no biggie at all.
---
You seem to be arguing about something competely different.  No one is saying you won't run 5 mans to get gear.
---
The comment was about the purpose of a guild and it's 100% for raiding.  That doesn't mean you won't run 5 mans with guild mates.
---
I have killed every boss in vanilla and have been raiding weekly for the past 3+ years.
---
It's not hybrid classes that are pigeon holed into one spec. It's min maxers that pigeon hole then as hard as they can because they forgot it's a game.
---
I went up to mid AQ40 with ret, and plenty of other non optimal specs / bad players. Many went up to naxx with close to no consume as I can read on this sub.
---
It's your choice.
---
No, this is just "I'm ok with RNG but not stacked RNG".
---
RNG 1: item has to drop
---
RNG 2: item forges
---
So you have to multiply the drop chance (lets say 20%) by the forge chance (lets say 1%, idk what it actually is). That's a 0.2% chance to get the forge. Which means most people will run that dungeon for a long time if they are trying for "true" BiS. 
---
Items being on a loot table is fine. Someone getting loot before you, because they earned the DKP, is fine (people who put in more work get rewared earlier/often than you, which is pretty fair IMO). 
---
You cant have titan forge RNG by itself, because the initial drop itself is RNG. How many levels of RNG do we need before /you/ complain? 
---
You cant see all the time: wait a moment... Like I said, once or twice is no problem but more will look suspicious.  
---
I personally was planning on doing alchemy and engineering on my Shaman,
---
However, I'm going to plan on also start off as a mining instead of engineering, and only switch to eng when I have cash and a ton of saved up metal bars to actually level past 260+
---
Alchemy I probably won't even pick up until 60 when I can just buy mats from the AH. Faster than trying to naturally level it up while leveling.
---
Dude, what makes you think a regular worker at Blizzard can call for changes in the game? They can't, they have no influence for that, they are simply there to code/design or whatever their job is. Blizzard are "in control" in a sense, but they are forced to follow guidelines provided by Activision in order to keep beating the annual revenue/growth targets. This in itself forces Blizzard to take messures to ensure that the growth keeps on going.
---
You could at least take some time and read about Blizzard's decisions to spread their microtransactions far and wide throughout their entire platform (not only WoW) and you might realize how much they have to change the games in order to please the growing need of increased revenue. 
---
If you actually think their PUBLIC parent company doesn't force them to make changes in order to keep beating earnings annually, then it's not much more I can say to you.
---
Something like +1% ilevel/stats/whatever would be ok. Just a small bump. 
---
If you plan on having alchemy later you could pick skinning and herbalism and and save up the herbs for later and vendor the skins. Once 60 drop skinning and pick alchemy. 
---
Just for my info: when you are at your work in incognito mode, can IT guys still see what sites you are browsing and if so, for how long can they see your history? 
---
Yeah back in the day there was a cap of 10. Of course deleting a character frees up a slot but I hate deleting anything 
---
That is my definition.  When classic comes back every raid except for the &lt;scrubs&gt; will use consumes, world buffs, and will optimize their raid comp.
---
&lt;Mediocre&gt; guilds will all do this and any guild who doesn't will not last.
---
The game won't be like it was in retail vanilla.
---
I mean, none of that really happened until like mop (or was it cata). But sure, a shitty loot system is why classic is amazing.
---
ive considered going back to SDF for movement keys during classic, but will likely use AWD instead.
---
haven't given my bindings much thought except for drain life on S (given I stay AWD) and dispel on scrollwheel forward/back for offensive/defensive.
---
abilities off the gcd (looking at you heroic strike) do so well on the scrollwheel.
---
a lot of the times you reach for an ability off the GCD with your left hand, you'll very slightly delay your next ability because you have to move your finger back to the key.
---
using the scrollwheel completely frees up your left hand to play the gcd game.
---
Rethink? I still use most of my vanilla keybinds in retail.
---
Better than nature‚Äôs wrath
---
May I show you the video of me getting roasted on a private server in fresh gear as a warlock that I stumbled upon a couple years ago. I‚Äôm famous. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JzwKWryT_N4
---
Lacroix
---
So I take it then you're a Hoard player!
---
The defense nerf comes way earlier than 1.12.  Most of the time, def nerf is in place and we dont have the items from 1.10 on ward. You dont need def cap for MC or BWL or ZG, at all. Its nice on broodlord but not necessary. The BiS lists that go for def cap for pre raid BiS are wrong. It defs makes it easy mode with 1.12 items.
---
Wow that is some next level shiat :D
---
Why would they be able to use swords at all in the first place...
---
...oh retail, right. Different game entirely.
---
I'm planning on going skinning/mining on my Rogue. Going to change skinning to engineering when I'm about level 45 and I can no longer skin things with level 225 skinning. Also saving mats for engineering on the way. 
---
Yikes, leveling than dropping enchanting sounds like a really bad idea. Enchanting is easily the most expensive trade skill to level, even supporting your materials with disenchanted tailoring items. Meanwhile when leveling it provides the least income possibility since nobody wants to spend money to enchant gear they'll replace in a few levels. The payoff for enchanting comes much much later, but in order to get there you need the valuable enchants like crusader, +15agi, +4stats to chest. These require even more time and money invested. And then once you're guild starts raiding regularly, you'll want to stay as an enchanter since people are getting upgrades every week.
---
Yup. My pally will funnel any gold to my bank alt who's camped at the AH for the first 2 weeks, just buying anything and everything I think I can flip reasonably.
---
Much better üëåüëåüëå
---
I know, feelsbadman.
---
This right here; it was like Blizzard knew that was the only way to get a ret pally in raid was to put kings as the 31 ret talent. Once it got moved out (and, if I remember right, demand for it went down once people started getting geared), I can't see why you would bring one. And I played a pally in vanilla.
---
I like you. 
---
&gt;!I am actually a bit of a hoarder in real like!&lt;
---
Wrong. You could most definitely /sit to proc. You can easily find videos and guides dated 2006 or earlier to prove this. Auto attacks did not proc it but yellow hits that could crit did.
---
They should have added more zones to azeroth instead of just remaking all the ones that were already there
---
It depends on what your focus is while playing. For speed leveling many already suggested dual gathering and I'm inclined to agree. It will go a long way to getting your lol 40 mount.
---
If you're taking your time and want to throw in some BGs then you might like to have a skilled up prof you can benefit from. Likewise, if your leveling an alt for twinking you might want a prof you can benefit from (engineering seems to popular but alchemy is good too), but I get the impression you're asking for your main.
---
&gt;  such as copper tube for the Darkshire quest
---
Part of me wants to say fuck it to leveling the first week and just farm bronze and become the level 10 bronze tube kingpin. You should have 1G at level 25, how badly do you want that super easy 6,950xp?
---
And in private servers every time you /sit between auto attacks it procs.
---
Yeah but that mainly in hardcore guild tho. Casual guild don't have as much threat problem and often struggle more with keeping the tank alive even if he only use a mitigation set.
---
...Why
---
I made it good.  This was the only item I ever paid RL money for.  One of my alts was an enhancement shaman that I used for PVP mostly.  I would follow around our High Warlord, drop windfury, warstomp or earthshock healers, and use my biggest heal on the warrior when Hand of Edward the Odd procc'd.  The challenge is that 4 seconds is actually not that long to recognize the proc, target the player and hit your heal button.  I didn't have any macros or anything fancy set up back in the day because, well.....Vanilla.
---
I remember in storm there was a spot close to where the barbershop is now that would take you under the castle and sometimes drop you in westfall
---
Yeah, they want to recreate some of that :).
---
I'll personally be a clicker in order to get the authentic experience
---
People didn't min-max as hard back then. It wasn't as common to see 22 warriors in a single raid as it is nowadays. People weren't too concerned with clearing a raid in 20 minutes. 
---
Lot of people were just playing the game however they wanted, ya know.
---
Yeah I still dont get why Blizzard hasnt gotten rid of it. The only people who don't hate it are Blizzard employees as far as I can tell.
---
I kind of liked it because it turned the front of Org into a sort of duel hub that always had a bunch of people chilling. 
---
Name a fight which you can't do without defcapped tank. (Spoiler: there is none).
---
+Defense is a good stat, but it is not as good as majority of people think. You can get defcapped with random +defense greens but you're going to be a useless tard with 3k HP and 0 threat. 
---
Yeah. Currently focusing on the main. I see hunter as an easy route to 60, but think a mage may be a better move. Especially with tailoring for bags and such for my alts. Trying to get the wife to play casually as well, so getting her set up with bags and start up cash will help. 
---
It works almost the same on pservers, but the devil is in the details. When you get crit your reck-counter goes up by one and on your next auto attack you will spend all generated reck-counters as additional auto attacks. The difference between the real version and private servers is that a crit from sitting down is registered as a crit for your reck-counters on pservers while they shouldn't in the real version. This enables you to control the times you get crit in a PVE setting, increasing your leveling efficiency.
---
Stalwart Clutch is not prebis for a tank. Wear Omokks or Brigam Girdle depending on patch.
---
That quote does not say anything about turning it off. It exactly confirms my words that they will use it as much as they like. I'm not going to answer there anymore because of bunch of stupid children downvoting me and hiding my posts, so normal people won't see that useful information anyway.
---
Decay started in the Naxx patch 1.11. You can't respec for awhile to make it kick in though. So if you respecced every week you would never notice it.
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch\_1.11.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.11.0)
---
Oh god, Wrath paladin was the pinnacle of Paladin-time for me. Such a beast as Ret in PVP and PVE healing was actually interesting. Ugh... miss it so much.
---
Most I see go for around 20s-30s early on, on avg. If you find those few suckers so I‚Äôd say you could maybe sell a couple for 50s. After that it comes to a point of being not worth because people still need to pay for skills and such. 
---
How does pointing out a flaw in one thing show that something else is amazing? Hilarious post though. 
---
Yeah dude, I know. I get that. That has nothing to do with this guys McDonald‚Äôs analogy though. 
---
His analogy is literally just about how someone got something better than you for doing the same content. That‚Äôs it. And that did happen in vanilla too... always has. It‚Äôs just worse now.  
---
I assume its a vocal minority and you will probably find a fair mix of assholes on both sides.. however this reminded me of a funny thing they brought up on the ClassicCast podcast the other night.
---
They were laughing about how the stereotype is that since the alliance races are "pretty" and the horde are "monstrous" that it must follow for a younger crowd to play ally and adults to play horde, so the youngins can have their paladin look just like them while the grownups are cool with looking scary and evil. However they all confirmed that in their experience its the opposite really, and because of that divide the horde actually attracts people who want to be perceived as "adult" or grown-up or intimidating or w.e... and is actually a much younger crowd overall lol.
---
Which would also fit with the insults you are seeing. So maybe there is some credence to that after all haha at least according to the hosts on that podcast (esfand staysafe tipsout etc)
---
How do you know it‚Äôll be in classic 2019?
---
What the fuck do you think "time-limited" means? It literally means exactly that. It will be for a limited time and thus turned off, if at all used.
---
Its beyond me how you could think others are reaching but its genuinly you who are. 
---
Nobody. Just the thought of playing a faction where Dwarves are the only cool race makes me want to puke. 
---
Downranked Consecration, Cleanse (if there are viable targets), [Oil of Immolation](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8956) every 15 seconds unless the enemies are immune to fire. You can also throw around some Flash of Light or even Holy Light at the cost of some DPS, but that's more likely to be useful in a dungeon than in a raid. 
---
How do healers here like to bind their different ranks/spells? Do you use a separate action bar for raiding?
---
My vanilla experience was different. It comes down to the guild and raid leader mentality, i guess.
---
That's my plan. I'll have 2 accounts, with one being a parked bank alt that my main funnels gold to. Hopefully my rush to 25 will net me a few gold (and bronze from my main engineering / mining) so the alt can buy out all the 20-30s ones, and relist. Then with those sales buy out the next pricepoint, and eventually control the market by the end of day 2.
---
He was ok at 1v1, thats about it. 
---
Yikes.
---
Yah I don‚Äôt get it. I personally love the alliance zoned areas much more than the horde. I can‚Äôt wait to revisit them. 
---
Definitely not the same, but my wife has never really been a gamer (only ever played Mario games... Roller Coaster Tycoon... The Sims).  She has told me that she will humor me and play with me this Summer.  
---
I've considered rolling up on P99 Everquest to introduce her to MMO concepts, since it was the first MMO I played.  This will either alienate her from MMOs or make her appreciate WoW Classic even more when it comes.
---
That is not how vanilla works. They are going to spend way more time in the world than in raids.
---
Uh, you could make the argument 2 different people walk into the same dungeon, kill the same boss but one person gets a weapon drop while the other gets nothing 
---
Near the beginning of BC I discovered that you could wall jump past some invisible walls in Silvermoon that blocked off the giant statue of Kael'Thas in a pit under Lorthemar's Chambers.  
---
It was far enough down to kill you if you made it down there but if you bubble/slow fall you could run behind the statue and you could see outside the city in both directions.  
---
I used to go down there when I was bored and offer people 10k to open trade with me within 30 minutes and no one ever collected lol.
---
Don't forget about all the people saying what a great game it is and how it's one patch away from retaking it's old glory. It's sad people still think that. When the game is so bad they dropped the sub model and hid their subs.
---
This is the best thing I've ever heard
---
Leveling up your profession can be fun. Honestly, I think it's a little sad to wait until max to level your crafting professions. You're skipping through all of the progression baked into them! You don't get to save up for that great item, or give your friends free enchants and getting free BoE green drops in return, or getting a new toy in engineering and trying it out in PvP, or making your own supply of healing potions or buffs to save your butt. Imagine if the fastest way to level was to use your initial abilities and you put off everything else until 60, only casting frost bolt, smite, etc. You're missing out on a huge part of the game!!
---
I spent a year trying to recreate the "glitch" so I could use it in battlegrounds. Never worked again after that.
---
I mostly mean defensively, so when people come after me it's nice to have things like reckoning &amp; consecration. I agree any spec for pala is support but just naturally ret is the offensive spec 
---
I would agree with you that PvE BiS is not the same. You only need +3% hit to cap against same level targets and PvE BiS is going to have a ton of hit that you won't need. For a lot of classes, you can get hit cap just from talents.
---
Now I'm by no means an expert on PvP BiS but I would guess stamina goes up in priority. I would like to see what everyone else has to say. I'm very interested in this topic.
---
I think armor is mostly self evident. Start from pve stuff, increase the weight of stamina and armor - decrease the hit cap you're aiming for. In some cases it will come down to personal play style, but basically the PvP rewards will be best.
---
Weapons, Trinkets, rings on the other hand will have larger differences since they are more likely to have sought after procs or on use effects. Stuff like Freezing Band, Skull of impending doom - etc.  Not much of it is class specific - maybe someone put together a list of all these lil nuggets.
---
Main bar #1 for day-to-day.

Main bar #2 raid/instance healing bar with multiple ranks etc.

Yup this was our dueling spot even into TBC. All the high rated ally arena players would just duel for hours and hours and someone was always hanging out there. You could watch the best of the best duel each other and learn tricks that way. Kind of like watching someones stream but in game instead haha and way before any streaming of course. Youtube barely existed lol
---
I plan on a slow progression with my wife. Hoping for a pally and priest combo so we can both learn how to heal and dps. We will both be doing profs there. 
---
But my main I want to sixty quick. If that‚Äôs even possible. Man, finding time for wow was easy as a student. Now, it‚Äôs probably gonna be a few hours a week!
---
That makes sense, thank you.
---
It also works with all relevant maces. Herald of Woe drops in BWL and should be better than any axe until C'Thun (unless you're the Nightfall bitch). Even if you do later on manage to get Dark Edge of Insanity, the next upgrade will be either Corrupted Ashbringer or Might of Menethil.
---
It‚Äôs different but still very smooth. There‚Äôs like one or two long quest chains in ur 20s that has a bunch of walking but they‚Äôre more fun than horde chains at that level. I highly suggest trying the other side as it will feel really fresh and exciting. Unless your committed to Shaman then don‚Äôt do it cause ele sham is so badass. 
---
I think AV is in at launch for Classic WoW and alot of the servers gold comes form that BG 31 silver per head of the enemy. So i think that when people hit 60 alot of gold is gonna flood the server. The economy this time is gonna ramp up fast in a few weeks this time around.
---
Sure thing!
---
Yeah Ret is certainly the more offensive spec with seal of command, the only way you do damage as prot is reck bombs otherwise it is slow autoattacks with seal /judgment of righteousness. 
---
I see a lot of Rets just charge straight into a fight and try to do damage- so that's why I emphasized the support aspect of the paladin.  A lot of people just play as if they're an MS warrior and it's not the same!  Missing out on a lot of the power you bring if you aren't really sharp with cleanses, blessings, and heals if the situation calls for it. 
---
Leveling is about the same. Raiding is easier on Alliance, premade vs premade favors Alliance due to Holy Paladins/warriors which are the meta classes. There are points horde is better like SM and points Alliance is better because they are so close to Black Rock Mountain. 1 v 1 racials only favors horde because Alliance never play their strongest racials (Dwarves and gnomes are strong) and more people seem to roll night elf than troll and they are both awful for pvp outside hunter, which is "ok" for both.
---
I expect population will be pretty even on PVP servers (Horde was vastly ounumbered in old Vanilla) and will heavily favor alliance on PVE servers.  simply due to threat and paladin blessings. The tanks can be bad on Alliance and it's no problem. Big problem on Horde. 
---
Think of bag slots as a surrogate for weight, ore weighs more than the metal it contains so it's logical you can carry less of it.
---
My dad hated me as a middle schooler Bc of wow and tried to get me into stocks. It did not work out as I cared more about the wow market. 
---
Not for a mage. That was also a popular UI at the time as it had a lot of flexibility compared to most.
---
I posted a thread about the coolest glitch during TBC: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/81ttwb/that_one_time_in_tbc_when_i_saw_the_code_for/
---
I haven't played or followed WOW since WotLK and everything I hear about retail makes me laugh my ass off.  Fucking chinpokomon pet battles?  Being able to trade BoP loot?  People buying new characters 10 levels below max?  Every class being able to heal?  No one talking in dungeons and raids?
---
No wonder why people are excited for classic to come out.  Who the fuck would play a game like that?

&gt; A lot of the changes players ask for are things which are done in TBC. I've literally seen people ask for better class balance, for Paladins to be effective tanks, for Kara and ZA to be released, for Alliance to get Shamans and Horde to get Paladins...but who don't want TBC. It's just strange to me. In my case, the majority of the changes I want are fixed by TBC launching.
---
The main issue with TBC, for me anyways, is that it's a package deal. I get to play protection paladin in raids, but I'm also stuck with flying mounts. Professions have more benefits, but then I have to deal with badges making gear feel cheap. Karazhan is great, but half the overworld is a boring space-wasteland. Essentially, TBC's improvements aren't enough to justify all the bad stuff in my eyes.
---
I tried tanking in a raid once, in WotLK Naxx. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and I'd like to try raid tanking again. Unfortunately, I don't enjoy warrior/bear gameplay and it's not very practical to take my protection paladin into a vanilla raid. I won't play a spec that I don't think is fun, so my options are either to put up with arena and dailies or forego raid tanking.
---
So yeah, Vanilla with TBC spec design and Karazhan? Sign me up. The whole TBC package? Ehh, not so much.
---
Mind = blown
---
Right, as I said, all three warrior taunt abilities are great. They're useful in so many situations and I use all three consistently. They're just one of the things that make warriors the absolute, undisputed tanks in Vanilla. I'm not disputing any of this, but on the subject that you were challenging me on, I can't in good faith call taunts group utility, when those are specifically designed to help the tank warrior do better at the job they signed up for in the first place.
---
That defias mask tho
---
Work from home.
---
Interesting. But I'm pretty much set on Druid right now. 
---
they could make more money by actually making the game good so that more people want to play it.
---
Blizzard is not innocent, they chose this and they still have control over the game design.
---
If Activision want to sell mounts,who gives a shit. The game is shit at many aspects even without the in-game shop.
---
Skinning/mining on hunter &amp; herb/alch on Mages is just too satisfying to give up while leveling imo. Can drop herbalism for tailoring at 60 if you want, but not necessary really.
---
I think you misunderstood my comment. I didn't comment on wether of not titanforging is good or bad (imo its a shit loot system). Merely that the analogy is flawed. Stacked RNG is just another kind of RNG (none stacked is classing, stacked is retail), its ok to be ok with that and its ok to not be ok with that, but to compare an RNG (mcforged nuggets) to a certainty (buying nuggets) is disingenuous.
---
Personally I feel titanforging as a whole should be removed, masterlooter should be brought back (it's peoples choice if they join groups with reserved items or not) and drops should be drops, so i'm not OK with stacked RNG either, but I still only see it as another form of RNG. 
---
All were possible, with work arounds, in vanilla, except for the quest one.
---
The minute they start "balancing" and putting in QoL changes, it's no longer Vanilla. We want the game as it was.
---
Can be worn on night elves too! I always go to westfall after teldrassil. 
---
Leveling from 10-25 or so feels slower on alliance IMO compared to leveling in the Barrens. Alliance have to move around a lot more to find quests. I struggle to do them before i outlevel them in the barrens/stonetalon/ashenvale as horde.
---
not trying to convince you to play hunter ^^
---
If you enjoy battlegrounds I think one of the biggest differences is queue time.
---
You can always keep the mining to have your own source of materials. 
---
If you plan on farming a ton (since you'll be a mage), you weigh the option of spending your gold on the mats instead.
---
Why can‚Äôt you use a mouse and keyboard?
---
Indeed, so many variables depending on what is actually available in even the proposed stage 1.
---
For example, "pre-raid" (i.e. not including gear aqcquired in MC/Ony directly)  will be Dark Moon Faire be available? If so, the orb of the darkmoon is easily solo farmable if you plan out a route with engineering and the plaguelands.  But if its not, back to farming BRD and DM for slight downgrades.

r/wowservers/ since it‚Äôs a pserver question
---
How would you even put all the keybinds on a console controller? 
---
nice. wil have a look at it too
---
While this is an excellent solution for a single player in a vaccuum, it doesn't work for many.  I have lots of friends that I've met playing different games and private servers that will be playing WoW Classic.  I want as many of them to be on the same server as possible.  This requires coordination, because each of my friends also has friends (that I don't know) and THEY want to be on the same server too.  I'm also part of an online gaming community that will all be on the same server.
---
I hope there is some announcement so I can help coordinate all these people.  But if not, probably a game time decision based on the initial launch, just as you mentioned.
---
It's not the spec, it's the lack of gear that has proper stats for the specs. But yes, most are fine except at the top 1% of play.
---
Devout Shoulders are blue my man. Perhaps you meant Prophecy?
---
Would I be ok with blizzard offering in game advantages for money?  
---
No, not really. 
---
The macro system is gonna be different 
---
Nost devs were re-creating Blizzard's game only because Blizzard wasn't doing it already.
---
They had a good sense of providing a service for their own community, though. I don't know whether this would translate into an ability for setting policies or designing Classic. I'm sure Blizzard has their own ideas.
---
I agree, priest is a pretty smooth leveling experience. Shadow is Mana starved in dungeons and raids.
---
Incognito only doesn't keep track of history in YOUR browser. But every where you go is still tracked :p
---
Most of the companies use a tool called "SIEM". Basically it store informations (logs) about things that happen in a IT way for usually 6 months. A SIEM will also trigger alerts when a problem occured based on the correlation of logs, but that's an other topic.
---
Yes yes, it is stored somewhere that you are going on reddit/wow right now at your work time :p But I doubt pple who have access to the SIEM would bother to check that or do anything about it, so you're fine ;)

[Nintendo‚Äôs position makes sense because they have enough cash laying around to run the company at a loss for 40 years ](https://nintendotoday.com/nintendo-not-doomed/) 
---
I don't definitively. But I doubt you really want people to be overly pedantic by adding "assuming blizzard doesn't decide to change the way this works" to everything they say about classic.
---
It would be great if they developed additional vanilla content or provided a way for the community to develop it on their own. When will we see the first pserver modeled after the classic client?
---
The worst thing for me was the mini-game you have to play as a guild officer in a raiding guild, a game i called "Manage 40+ 'adults' schedules and personalities so that we can all show up at the right time and have fun." It's surprisingly difficult to get your raid group to consistently show up on time consistently. It's difficult to manage back ups/alternate raiders in a way that keeps them interested in the guild. It's ~~difficult~~ impossible to balance clashing personalities of people in your guild. At some point every guild leadership will run into a "i can't tolerate X player and refuse to continue playing with them, you have to choose him or me, and i will try and pull as many friends away as I can if you dont choose me." Every single one will eventually run into that, multiple times even if you last long enough, if you don't have a plan for what to do in that situation then there's a good chance it's going to ruin your guild. I loved raiding, but at some point the administrative overhead that it took to keep raiding organized in Vanilla was almost its own job. I'm honestly shocked that we didn't hear about eccentric wealthy WoW fans hiring their own office administrators to handle "Guild Organization" duties.
---
My most interesting change was scroll-wheel-click. I used it as Blink on retail but for some reason it works so well for auto-run in Vanilla.  
---
I guess it‚Äôs because you do so much more walking and having to reach for num lock is a hassle. 
---
exactly, I can get a free cast of roots with a war stomp and the extra mana/stam/AP is really nice.
---
So true although to be fair everyone that I know at least used a macro that just casted them all so you can just spam the one button anyway. 
---
I believe there are some quests npc‚Äôs will offer you only if you have certain professions. I know for certain there are some quests you need to have cooking trained to access, may be true for fishing and first aid, but probably not primary professions.
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure our shaman raiders had a macro that just casted them all and possibly even ones that won't up with just mashing one button. 
---
Nah, the auction house API is hugely limited in vanilla compared to later versions of the game, which is why most auction addons are pretty weak for 1.12
---
Stuff like TSM wouldn‚Äôt work with 1.12 
---
I believe it was Earthshaker ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=17073](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17073)). Won it on my resto druid during an MC pug. I just wanted it because it was an epic item that I technically could equip and since no one else wanted it, they let me have it. I was 11 years old, don't judge me. 
---

Yea, its not a perfect analogy. But RNG gear drop exists on both sides of the equation so to speak, so we can cancel it out. This means (when it drops) item x is item x is item x. Forging changes that. Yea they are both RNG. Green and blue are both colors, that doesnt mean the sky will be green and the trees will be blue.

This is the most important comment in this thread.  A guildie in another game did this with their children and it sounded like GOLD.
---
If your kids do something bad and you need to punish them --&gt;  Their punishment is a certain period of time farming for you on one of your characters.  Skipped school?  That will be 5 Larval Acids.  fender Bender with the car? That will be 10 stacks of Runecloth.

You are welcome.

You would be surprised just how many people auction things below vendor price.
---
It is. Leatherworkers can make a consumable (which can be sold on the AH) though that makes you undazeable for 2 hours if used. Also, you can't be dazed if you're in tank spec.
---
You either were born in retail or work for blizz. The analogy wasn‚Äôt supposed to be that deep. It was hilarious and semi accurate. Maybe you just aren‚Äôt intelligent enough? Not sure. 
---
Hah, you learnt two lessons.
---
So weird to see an early widescreen high res screenshot - must have felt baller back then ;) 
---
Heh, that's why I'm the warlock CL. Usually on Alliance there are like 5 locks *at most* in the guild and it's really easy to manage. I do hear horror stories from the mage and rogue CL every officer meeting though, fuck that shit. 
---
I think people forget how much vanilla changed. A frost mage in 1.5 did about 500 dmg with a frostbolt in MC with very good gear at the time. A fire mage did about 1200 with a frostbolt near the end of 1.12 with good gear. This was a culmination of itemization changes, talent changes, and under the hood updates to combat calculations.... All of which trivialized MC and severely nerfed BWL, even during vanilla.
---
The experience one will have on Classic or a pserver just fundamentally cannot be the same as it was in vanilla.
---
Would definitely suck to get an epic world drop in the first week. Nobody can afford it lol. 
---
If you want to min-max you can have engineering but it's not required, especially if you won't have enough time to manage more than one toon. If you will be a clothie then engi/tailoring can be an option (bloodvine googles as an option). Or engi/alchemy. In both cases you could use like a druid herbalist - to get herbs, bloodvine etc.
---
Look, dude, Im not asking for a scientific fucking explanation, the thread is about annoying things and it annoys me.
---
The question was what's the reason everyone says it's great on a private server and not great on live servers.
---
Plus, I don't recall it working on live at all.
---
1. Actually a pretty good UI for back then.
---
2. You‚Äôre a cunt.
---
It will be more like the retail client than the 1.12 client
---
For example a hunter farming Maraudon needs a very limited amount of keybinds. 
---
You can easily do some repetitive really easy farming like Maraudon, lasher farming, dogs in DM:N etc. with a controller from the comfiness of your couch.
---
You would have to fight through their armies of brain dead followers/subscribers first.

Then we get into the same problems we have with the no-changes discussions.  Which additions in TBC are game-breaking and what made it the way it is?
---
Personally, I think it's all great in TBC, because it wasn't overdone to the point where it became a problem.  For example, heroic dungeons are fine, but 17 different difficulties for a dungeon and level scaling are problems.
---
I am trying to get my girlfriend to do the same thing but she is stubborn lol.

&gt; Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit. However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.   
---
Maybe for easy content you could do that, but after your done you would still have to go back to M&amp;KB. Why spend your time learning your keybinds on 2 different input devices?
---
But those kind of addons were also available in vanilla. Not having access to them would further remove classic from the ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù experience for a lot of folks. Now I‚Äôm not a hardcore ‚Äúno changes‚Äù guy, but some addons (like cooldown timers) are/were super helpful. I‚Äôm pro addons in general and will just avoid the ones I don‚Äôt want to use.

---
Are we really just reposting r/wowcirclejerk now?
---
Why not let the people who want to play with these addons use them? How would another person using a questing addon affect your gaming experience? 
---
the addons existed in vanilla. you're saying that something that existed in vanilla should be removed because it's not the authentic vanilla experience. 
---
For stage one it‚Äôs not too bad given that DM has such good gear. Then the rest can be filled in from MC/ony drops as they come. It‚Äôs not like Naxx gear will be an option at that point
---
Learning hunters mark, autoshot, pet attack, mend pet, multi shot, aimed shot and feign death in 5minutes on a controller and then farm from the couch the next 3 years sounds like a reasonable time investment.

If you think questie is detailed, you'd run screaming from pfQuest.  It shows you every single spawn point for everything for every quest, not just a general area where things are like Questie.
---
I mean, it's technically possible, but I'm not aware of anything at that time that did that. Unless you just mean an enhanced quest log,in which case you sound like you answered your own question.
---
I don't use Questie.  Never have and never will.  I don't use Joanna's guide or anything.  I know all the Horde quests like the back of my hand.  I recently started on the Alliance side on a private server (my guild will be Alliance in Classic).  I still did not use any quest help.  I read the quests and explored.  It took longer and was generally more rewarding, although sometimes frustrating.  I did check a website once or twice for a mob location, but honestly this was when I was tired and should have logged off anyway.  If I don't have the energy to find the mob myself, then I need a break.
---
KTM threatmeter - This is required so you don't pull aggro and wipe your group/raid.
---
Deadly Boss Mods - This is required because of raid warning you get during boss mobs.
---
These are the only 2 add ons i consider "required" and really a guild could choose to not use these for an additional challenge.
---
I am considered a minimalist because I use so few add ons.  Oh I also use a DoT timer on my warlock.
---
DPS meters - I hate these.  Many people think Flying or LFR were the beginning of the end, but I place a lot of blame on DPS meters.  They are useful if your raid is having trouble downing a boss and you need to identify the weak links.  That is an uncommon occurance IMO.  I was in a MoP guild that kept wiping to certain bosses.  After each wipe our DPS would link the meters and pat each other on the back AS IF WE DIDNT JUST WIPE.  Drove me nuts and ultimately was my final straw in quitting Retail.
---
Flintlocke?
---
that's not how that works. datamining gets EVERYTHING in database. there is no way that it somehow magically missed some secret quests.
---
Auctioneer and AH add-ons existed back then...
---
If you are quick to 60 and start to farm gear guilds will be intrested since Fury warriors are crazy dps dealers in vanilla.
---
2h is the way you level all the way to 60 there are plenty of guides where you can find 2 hands on your way to 60
---
I don't know what point you are trying to make with your colour example, I'm sorry.
---
But stacked RNG is just an extended form of RNG, the most likely outcome from a boss kill is nothing. You roll once for loot and then roll further for higher forged levels, when you lose the roll that's the gear you get.
---
It's a shit system, but it is absolutely not the same as guaranteed against RNG - this would have to be gear you buy from vendors having the potential to titanforging when you buy - and that's not the case.
---
You can dislike the system (I don't know anyone who does actually like it) without need to make wrong comparisons. 
---
A better analogy is a lottery. Before loot was a raffle, you bought your ticket (killed the boss) and it either won or it didn't. Now everyone has the same ticket, but for some reason when some people go to collect their prize it's considerable better than the prize you won, for no apparent reason other than luck. 
---
Loot is ok when it feels like a raffle, not when it feels like a lottery where the best combinations are locked behind the smallest % chance of winning.  
---
Leveling 0-300 all at once is the most boring thing imaginable.  You have to invest in hundreds of mats just to throw them away, then spend hours and hours crafting while standing still.
---
I plan on going tailoring and enchanting form the start and sticking with it end game.  I'll get some bags and gear along the way, and can sell some of it with the cloth that just drops naturally throughout the course of playing.  Enchanting will give me a nice little edge throughout the whole leveling experience.
---
As a mage I'm not too worried about getting mount gold.  A few hours AOE grinding in dire maul should take care of it in probably less time than the hours of picking herbs or skinning, plus the hours and time cost to change professions at 60.

Every tortoise is a turtle, but not every turtle is a tortoise.
---
People do it in FFXIV and that game has more abilities/longer rotations than wow.  I only ever played FFXIV on PC, so didn't experiment with it myself.  However, from what I gather it's generally lots of combined key presses.
---
If you dont want to tank ever, i dont recommend playing warrior, even on raids i had to offtank stuff as a fury. If you dont mind tanking for 1 encounter or just to help out then go for it.
---
In germany tortoises are literally called LANDturtles and turtles are called... turtles
---
If you roll a warrior you will be expected to tank. You will not have great success in refusing to do so. 
---
Yeah that nice pvp rank 8 gear from start on all the best vanilla servers past 2 years has been too nice. Without that I‚Äôd hate to think of what I‚Äôd replace those with. 
---
It seems like those kind of addons were what blizzard payed attention to while developing the further expansions. Making things too easy kickstarted the snowball towards retail. 
---
All I hope is that the playerbase hasn't become too conditioned to just follow icons on the map and understand that the lore of each zone is complimented by the adventure into the unknown and having no option but to play the role of a new recruit of the horde or alliance, the intended role.
---
Leveling going to take a while and when classic releases everyone‚Äôs gonna be level 1, so you might be a few levels above the curve but then you‚Äôll still need to wait up for everyone else in order to do raids and such
---
Was QuestHelper not available in Vanilla?  That is the addon that the modern quest UI was built around.
---
I've always done whatever keybind, like 2, and the alternate rank is shift 2 and so on
---
How can we have an adventure into the unknown again if we‚Äôve all become familiar with the content already? It‚Äôs impossible to re create 2004 when it‚Äôs 2019, but adding creature comforts can make the experience better over all for some. It‚Äôs why a lot of people play retro console games with HDMI mods, it can help make past experiences feel better.
---
I think Skinning/Herb is the best combination for ease and profit.
---
Skinning while leveling is easy-peasy, and you can just vendor the level for nice pocket change... which adds up over time!
---
Herb probably won't be too lucrative to start, but if offers you two paths to efficiency:  
---
* You could mail herbs to an alt for later leveling alch, OR

* You could farm the herbs that the serious raiders are going to need for consumables and probably make a decent bit of gold
---
The way I see it, servers will *eventually* outgrow the cool gear afforded by Leatherworking, Tailoring, Blacksmithing.  But servers will never outgrow consumables.  As long as there's a serious raiding scene, people will need herbs.
---
This is so wrong. Some guilds will stack upwards of 4-6 fury warriors, possibly more in the later raid tiers. The issue arises when the population of fury warriors greatly outweighs the demand.
---
Crossposts/literal copy-and-paste posts should give credit to the original
---
You're right. I was young and not the gm. To me, it was just a group of guys. I didn't know.
---
1. Pretty much high. Not all warriors make it until lvl60 and even less know to to play it properly.
---
2. 2H fury is only really viable on horde side and still loses to DW in single target DPS assuming equal gear. You can pull off decent numbers in Slam spec with 2H on ally side, but serious skill and powerful gear is required. So you transition to DW once you have collected some hit gear from your Pre-bis list or whatever you're following.
---
3. Yep, some buddies are optimal. It should not be a problem since your interests match. 
---
4.There could be an overlap in certain guilds, but it's not something you should be worried about much. 
---
I will not refuse to offtank stuff if it is asked of me, but im not going in for the tanking experience.
---
How about we delete websites that have leveling guides as well because people viewing those guides will not be moving aimlessly?
---
Thanks for this perspective. Especially in a main, seems to make sense. 
---
I will do what is asked of me in a raid obviously, so if asked to offtank stuff as a fury warrior, then yes i will do that :)
---
Nothing that can be done about people having all of information for all the quests. If blizzard were to ban quest addons then the people that want to minmax will just use something like Joanna‚Äôs guide on another monitor which is just as detailed. 
---
I‚Äôm only concerned about addons that could undermine the spirit of vanilla aka gearscore or some sort of group finder.
---
God if gearscore becomes as prevalent as it was in late wrath or legion/bfa I‚Äôll slam my penis and balls in my window. 
---
I wager that the closed eyes were the breaking point.
---
Exactly ‚Äì there's no practical compromise, because even if players could somehow agree on their ideal WoW, Blizzard would just mess it up.
---
I don't think it should be removed I just think we should point out that if we use too many and make it too easy, classic leveling wont be what we wanted it to be. Not that there's something wrong with that, just wanted people to rethink their intended addons. 
---
Oh! Rhok'delar, Giant Stalker, dual Bone slicing hatchet &lt;3
---
If only it was a female dwarf..
---
&gt;I played on a vanilla server just to check it out, and all the hype directed me to all these addons for questing that people said were "necessary". It was so obvious which players had the addons and which didn't. The addon was called 'Questie' (i think), and essentially it shows you where all the quest givers are and also where the objectives are. Watching it, it seemed like any person who wasn't using addons was running around aimlessly wasting time walking in the "wrong" direction.
---
I don't believe you. You can't possibly have enough information about which quest people were on and if they were going out of their way for other reasons (professions, pvp, grinding, other quests, etc.), or have watched enough people to make any sort of general conclusion.
---
Or are you telling me you joined a private server "just to check it out", then spent countless hours monitoring players questing habits all over the world?
---
Came to say Paladin because if I wanted to fall asleep I'd just go to bed. 
---
Thank you :)
---
I got a titanforged big Mac meal once. Ordered a big Mac meal with a large drink. Drive through handed me a bag with my order and a 10pc nuggets and Jr chicken inside. While I was looking through the bag another ployee handed me a wnd drink.
---
Didn't get a socket though.
---
What I'm saying is that using a questing addon will affect a player's leveling experience, that's all. I understand that it wont affect someone else. Just saying be weary, this is just a small detail.
---
Oh boy I have so many glitch adventures. I'll try to keep things to the more hilarious, random and obscure ones.
---
- Permanent Necropolis speed buff as a DK in the starting zone. I don't know how I triggered this, this was back in the beta. I somehow kept the 100% speed buff while on the questing area, causing me to get flooded with confused whispers (to which sadly I had no answer).
---
- Stat duping in the PTR. I can't remember the exact patches but it was something like 1.12 and 2.4 PTR. The vanilla one wasn't too great because it was slow and limited, but it still allowed me to run around AV with like 30k HP. The TBC one had me running around with as high at 10 million HP and enough haste to make Arcane Missiles a 0.023 second cast.
---
- Swimming flight glitch in TBC. Abusing a well timed mount up + polymorph would allow the sheep to literally walk up in the air (at random). Just break polymorph at that moment and the target can swim in the air until he lands (walk speed). This was used to solo Doomreaver by just wanding him to death while flying above unreachable terrain (and no I don't know why this didn't trigger evade).
---
- Water Elemental health reset bug. This was late WotLK, perhaps the Cataclysm pre-patch? Anyway, I never figured this bug out complete but your WE would just reset its health back to its base value (i.e. before gear is applied), which for me was like 71% or so. This often happened some random amount of time after using a damaging frost spell. I used this bug to solo MC, ZG, AQ20 and Karazhan (minus Netherspite). This also ended up extending in me teaming up with my guild's paladin tank to duo 10-man normal Noth, Heigan and Loatheb. I used WE as an off-tank on Noth, but for the most part it was just the Paladin being stupidly durable. However, 
---
on Loatheb he was close to dying after about 6-8 minutes or so, at which point due to the no-threat buff of the spores the Water Elemental overaggro'd and proceeded to tank the rest of the fight. I seriously regret discovering this bug late. It was incredibly fun to figure out ways of keeping threat on my WE for as long as possible and balancing his damage intake with my threat generation (as I had to attack to use offensive frost spells to trigger his heal). Some of the fights were damn hard and easily among the most challenging things I did in WotLK besides heroic raids.
---
I think that was a TBC thing? I remember an enhanced quest log, and quest tracker, but nothing that provided HELP on HOW to do quests.
---
Salt levels over 8000
---
Thats fair I guess. ‚ò∫
---
A lot of tabbing out/second monitor use will get exhausting. It may even cause players to just figure things out for ourselves, assuming we actually believe that we can.

---
After all, they wouldn't announce those things on blizzcon panel if they were just considering that.
---
oh, go back to your fucking safe space. everyone makes fun of everybody else, and you know? they're right. if you can't act like a normal human being, please, do stick to retail, the classic crowd really isn't interested in your raging victim complex. 
---
oh, and protip: the moment anyone uses the word "toxic" seriously, they lose just about every sliver of credibility.
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
I totally agree with you.
---
There is no nightmare though. It's so rare that an item from a lower source is going to TF to anything decent that it's not worth farming for. It's a nice bonus when it does happen. It was only a nightmare during legion when people believed without evidence that LFR heroes were running around with full mythic gear. There is never a scenario where some pleb is going to actually out gear someone doing real content or even be close to it. 
---
For me I don't worry about TF at all. I'm not worried about some pleb that isn't in my raid having better gear than me because that's not a thing that really happens. (I've seen two screenshots EVER of a single piece of LFR gear maxing out) and when a piece of mine TFs it's a nice bonus. 
---
They still can't equip swords though.
---
I mean people are gonna use what they want. Some people leveling their 3rd alt might not care much about a "genuine(?)" experience. I personally don't plan to use quest add-ons but I do like to have a swing timer, mail box add-ons are useful, and I def want a buff/debuff timer.
---
example plz
---
I want to raid and do PvP. I'm thinking: Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Hunter, Rogue, or Druid. I have all those at 90-120 so I have experience in them, but I started playing end of Sunwell, start of WotLK
---
I killed Thrall as horde using the "Mark of Shame" debuff. Took a few tries to do it without randos showing up to heal him.
---
Wonder if I still have the screenshot...
---
Oh hey it's Plaguehand again! Love the name.
---
&gt;  and all the hype directed me to all these addons for questing that people said were "necessary".
---
Maybe you should start thinking for yourself what is necessary and wha it not, instead of blindly following the hype.
---
I mean, do you seriously think game developers make a game while thinking "players have to find some necessary external software by themselves to play our game!"?..
---
Arcanite Reaper, HOOOOOOOOO!
---
If you queued for a bg at 19 and then dinged before going in you would be lvl 20 in a 19 capped battleground. You could do this for each bracket. I'm really surprised I've never heard anyone else mention this.
---
That poor rogue is about to get shit canned by that reck bomb!
---
enchanting doesn't need to be skilled up to disenchant, which is all im using it for
---
Fuck 2 handed leveling that shit is so slow feeling. I have a savage dw build that works really well and rips people apart in PvP.
---
I don't think that it is impossible. Also 15 years may cause even some of the old hardcore players to be a bit rusty and for newer/casual players this may even seem like a brand new game.
---
Rogue. I've tried a few times but coming from maining a warrior tbc to legion I suck at stealth.
---
Warlock is a close 2nd because pet management means I'd rather play hunter  
---
I'm going to try paladin this time even if ret is garbage, I find it easier too stomach over my other 2 never endgamed classes. 
---
That's a horrible analogy. 
---
It makes some horrible assumptions. Firstly that it devalues anything. In the case of WoW if you do harder content you will ALWAYS have better gear. 
---
The second assumption that's horrible is that they're going to buy a 4 piece and get a bunch of extra shit. The far more likely scenario is that they'd buy a 4 piece and get a 5 piece instead. 
---
We know in WoW that in an average length tier if you were to run normal every single week you'd see ONE piece of high titanforged gear. There are no people in normal or even heroic running around with full sets of current mythic level gear unless it's from M+ in which case they deserve it. It's very difficult to get upset about some pleb getting a single piece of gear that's around the same ilevel of every single piece of gear that drops for me. 
---
set up your mouse wheel so it switches targets, or use proper addons so you can target anyone? but yeah, healing paladins work, you can literally heal people just putting your mouse and keyboard on the floor and using your feet. (speaking from personal experience) 
---
That makes a lot of sense, not to say all horde players are like this, of course. 
---
I mean to create meaningful irl connections through the game and long lasting fellow adult friends, so I‚Äôll likely be going alliance. Maybe a horde alt too, to punish assholes on my ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù faction. 
---
At least people doing that are technically learning (or studying) the game. It isn't directly fed to them. Googling your issue still means you're learning the zone, the NPC, the quest, the dungeon etc. If its plastered on your in game map we maybe subject to a 'zombiesque' play style. Also not saying it should be banned or deleted, this is just a small psa.
---
Fair enough. Hunter pets still following people who stealth wasn't fixed until mid TBC. It's reasonable to assume that Blizzard will implement it this way in classic WoW given what we know (so far and I sincerely hope this doesn't change) about their stance of preserving the way the game was back then, rough edges and all.
---
FFXIV was designed with a controller in mind because they wanted to sell the game to console systems.  There is a lot under the hood that is designed to make the use of a controller practical. 
---
I think it was in Vanilla.  You'd get zones on your map and mini-map, arrows with where to go, it would tell you which mobs to loot and how much you had of each.
---
Even chat log which would tell everyone in the group how much you have of each.
---
I would love to see what DW build you think is better for leveling than 2 handed.
---
I think the analogy speaks more to the ever-moving carrot that is the retail gearing system. You can‚Äôt realistically obtain your BiS because of how much RNG is involved.
---
Don't remember the name of it, but there were some breadcrumbs from Loch Modan to Stormwind that when I try to do the quest, I'm ineligible.
---
Most of the quests disappear when you're no longer eligible, so it's hard to find exactly which ones.  Like I said, they're inconsistently applied so it's hard to just go from breadcrumb to breadcrumb.
---
Gahhhh! Come on with the order! Take forever! 
---
I agree with you about gearscore. 
---
100%. I am ashamed to admit I am ready for the more hardcore version. Including all the minor cities like goldshire, the crossroads etc.
---
I don't have to get all the keybinds, I only have the basic abilities needed.  For the warrior my main buttons are overpower, rend, cleave, and charge for the four main buttons and then other buttons are stuff like demo shout, thunderclap, health potion, hamstring.  You really hardly need any buttons to do basic PVE grinding and if a tense situation comes up I can immediately switch to KB/Mouse if I want that extra control and capability. 
---
I have the mouse and keyboard fully set up, I just want to get high and lean back in my seat!
---
Now I want McDonalds... FFF
---
Well he said ‚Äúlooking at‚Äù for sharding. I forgot how they had talked about loot trading. I hope they change loot trading. Personally, id rather not have it AND not have gm tickets either. I hope they confine it to raids.
---
Sharding is still debated. Since they worded it the way they did. Personally, i want no sharding. I‚Äôve made friends in the first hours of a server by grouping up. 
---
I expect both to be in but I really don‚Äôt want them. 
---
Its a bit of both;
---
\- They knew the game they played, and want to go back to playing an MMORPG
---
\- Given Blizzard's recent missteps, or even philosophies that they view as successes or 'improvements', people don't trust that they CAN get it right if they change something. Even if it seems inconsequential. 
---
You know, that post made me want to castrate the poster.  You got what you paid for, but someone else got a lucky bonus and rather than be happy for them, you're pissed.  Every blade of grass must be cut down to the same height, right?  Hooray for entitlement!!!
---
These are scrub lvl key binds, wheres mouse scroll up and down? Shift scroll up and down? 
---
Where is shift wasd? The best key bindings in the game? Once you start using shift wasd, it will blow your mind away noob. 
---
Gitgud scrub.
---
P.S. also no usage of shift space bar, just pure garbage binds. And using f1-4? Anything that takes your hand off the keyboard and move it around away from wasd is garbage. 
---
Haha ok, didnt know that. Well I work in a small company (5 people) and we dont do the IT stuff by ourselves but when we have a problem with internet or if we cant connect to the server we call a company who fix it for us. Can that company check our history then or Im completly fine? 
---
I am not super comfortable in my chair leaning forward slightly to get to my mouse/keyboard.  Leaning *BACK* in the chair is what its all about to be nice and comfy.  I basically just want to put on an album, have a toke, and grind for an hour or so as a relaxing activity.  
---
I had hunter's mark on 7 for 8 years for no reason.
---
1. fwars are in ok demand. especially geared and tryhard, cos they along with rogues do the most damage especially in the early raids, raid rely on your damage. if you'd be a rogue it would be harder. I wouldn't really say that fwar is quite average in term of competition for spots.
---
2. first of all it depends on a faction, as horde got wf making 2h on par with 1h for quite a while. But ya it depends on how much hit you manage to get, and luck with weapons. 
---
3. at first its kinda rough, but as you get gear, warriors chunk mobs one after another, super fast and swift, and don't need to eat. so its ok later actually. in term of grinding. 
---
and honestly even in prebis its better than some classes like healers, or hybrids, cos you do ton of damage. There are ton of things you can grind for gold quite effectively. like satyrs in felwood for felcloth. (just as an example). 
---
4. tanks and fwars go for completely different pieces, so you shouldn't be stressed about tanks getting all the gear at all. tanks get tank gear, fwar - fwar gear. Almost no overlap in gear. (its not bfa with ilvl and universal gear :D). So don't worry at all about that, tanks got their items, you - yours. you gonna be competing with other fwars, rogues and sometimes hunters. 
---
The analogy just makes the poster look like a whiny, entitled little bitch.  However, from my understanding of the gearing system in retail, it's basically stolen straight from the Korean RPGs, except with less paid loot boxes.
---
There are addons that will scan and buy things listed below vendor price so you have to be fast in order to get those. I was talking about the market as a whole. Not individual mistakes.

**GPD Win 2**

The GPD Win 2 is a Windows-based handheld computer that is the successor to the GPD Win.  It is manufactured by Chinese company GamePad Digital, and crowdfunded just as its predecessor was.  Announced in first-quarter 2017, the crowdfunding campaign officially kicked off on January 15, 2018, and quickly surpassed its goal.  Within days, it reached $1.8 million USD funding off of a stated $100,000 goal.
---
yep i use scroll click for auto run as well.
---
Scroll up and down for most used skills like frost bolt for mage, sunder armor for tank, sinister strike for rogue.

My keybinds went through probably 6-8 iterations and I think have finally reached its peak performance.

Hi hippoofdoom,
---
Hope you are doing well. I stumbled upon your post on wowclassic during my lunch hour regarding your issue looting with an xbox controller. Unfortunately, all interactions to the world have to be done with the mouse and cannot be performed with macros.
---
I am currently leveling a vanilla hunter on *PSERVER* using a Steam Controller with much success . The Steam Controller allows for plenty of customizability for setting up keybinds. Additionally, the right thumb pad can be set up as a mouse which gets around the limitations of the xbox controller.
---
If you're interested in picking one up, DO NOT PURCHASE AT FULL PRICE ($49.99 + shipping)!!! I would recommend buying from Gamestop instead
---
I'm able to export my controls and send them to you which would probably set you up to be able to tweak things further to your liking. Just LMK if you are interested!
---
There was a bug very early on (Pre BWL I think) were if you logged out with aspect of the cheetah on, you would log back in and it would stack if you re-applied it without activating another aspect. If you could keep relogging it would stack up to at least 300% needless to say, for a few weeks my hunter didn't use flightpaths.
---
One of the very early videos on Warcraft Movies actually shows off someone using this to race a guy on a Windrider to Tanaris from Org.
---
I used to do the bar switch at one point but find that sometimes you mess up and don‚Äôt know which bar you are on, or are looking at the screen focused on a fight and didn‚Äôt see you are on the wrong bar. Shift and crtl the same key is probably good enough for 3 diff ranks of the same spell. 
---
The way I got my wife to play was giving her an amazing b-day experience then, when my b-day came around, I only wanted one thing...
---
It worked 'cause now she'll play with me the odd weekend.
---
If you go this route I suggest asking that she levels up to 10 with you as your present rather than a set amount of time. You can get more time playing together this way and a random event won't ruin your game date. 
---
His superior biting capabilities will be used come summer '19. 
---
Bad communicator. I hope you're right.
---
I picked up on how addons were discussed on a pserver's general chat. People were speaking in chat making references to their quest addons, or telling people to download addons. I thought it was of note. I didn't spend hours monitoring people I leveled a human priest to 22 and a troll shaman to 15. Retail-style QoL addons were everywhere and I wanted to bring it to attention. 
---
You're right, I obviously couldnt know if everyone had the addons but I believe that it was definitely enough to prompt this discussion.
---
the hardest part of this is not healing the tank after he does some bullshit like this.
---
You don‚Äôt wanna do warrior unless you want to tank until 60 and at 60 (very most likely) warriors are kind of a bitch to level as well. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre fury spec, you will be asked to tank for every instance you get a group for. Even if you say you‚Äôre damage you‚Äôll most likely end up having to tank. Personally I found tanking fun but leveling solo as a warrior in the beginning is boring af. And slow. If you want to do serious DPS and as melee you‚Äôre just better off going rogue... or even hunter. Hunger is excellent in PVP and leveling, rogue is better for DPS/raiding and easy to level, fun as hell too: Don‚Äôt get me wrong , there are some bad ass warriors and it‚Äôs not impossible to deal insane damage as a warrior EVENTUALLY but you won‚Äôt do as much damage as a rogue would unless you have all DPS specd gear/epics.
---
Oh dear you'd be better off having her play on a WoW private server than P99. I love me some EQ, but it's a whole world of pain compared to WoW, you might scare her off the genre for good.
---
I use 1, 2, 3, 4, Q, R, T, F, G, H, V and then shift versions + mouse buttons. This gives me enough for most of the abilities I might use (plus some other non-combat ones I can click) but putting a bunch of healing ranks is too much, and also more difficult for me to remember. And personally, it's easier for me to keep track of 1, 2, 3, 4 than 1, shift 1, ctrl 1, etc when they're different versions of the same spell.
---
I think people telling you things are necessary are wrong. Play how you want. If i want yo use addons galore i can. If you don‚Äôt want to then dont. 
---
If you roll Ally you won't need legs anyway. The dead need not worry over mortal concerns.
---
KTM and DBM are two of the mods I'd love to see somehow disabled. 
---
The existence of KTM is a huge nerf to hybrids. With perfect-ish knowledge of how much threat they are generating, pure DPS can go balls to the wall with impunity. This means they can leverage their mechanics to the max, and thus destroy hybrids are the damage meters. When threat is a hidden mechanic, pure dps have to throttle themselves to avoid being the guy who wipes the whole raid. They still outperform the hybrids, but no longer can the white-knuckle the agro curve.
---
DBM is the other mod I'd love to see gone. It absolutely trivializes content, although in a way there's more blame on the content that allows for a mod like DBM. And even before DBM we'd have a guy sitting there with a stopwatch on vent counting down when to run in and out, etc. I'd love to see them introduce more randomness into the various timings of boss skills which would obsolete that whole family of addons. 
---
1. It is very hard to find a spot in the BEST guilds, but more semi-hardcore guilds you'll do just fine in getting a guild as long as you get prebis.
---
2. Depends if you are a horde or alliance. On horde 2handers are good all the way till AQ(and heck you can prolly do decent dps in there too). On alliance you can do 2hand arms in dungeons, it's a great spec for dungeons, but as soon as you start raiding you go DW.
---
3. Mining can give you money but I would honestly recommend you either skip it entirely(engineering is quite cheap to level honestly), or you drop it after you have gotten enough arcane crystals for all your arcanite stuff(lionheart, and optionally arcanite reaper &amp; anti-disarm gloves if you like pvp).If you do go mining then definitely DME is the best way to go once you have prebis maybe some raiding gear. You shouldn't have that much of an issue finding a partner if you are in a raiding guild. Before you start DME you make money by basically doing dungeons and killing mobs while these dungeons start. The high lvl bats in EPL are very great for this, a lot of warriors actually just grind these to level when approaching 60 because they are very good gold. 
---
4. Tanks gets all the TANK loot in the start, and if you are a tryhard guild, the MT gets some of the first dps items, like first DFT, BoA and such. It's a bit rough but honestly it's not that big a deal. Fury warriors don't really get that many items anyway, and you are still very strong because of amazing prebis pieces, as long as you get a couple of weapons :) 
---
Stop feeding the troll
---
Addons in classic wow are necessary af. They enhance game play. Otherwise you‚Äôre just making shit harder on yourself. You‚Äôll still get the experience you‚Äôre looking for with add ons. Add ons are your friend, love them use them! 
---
[Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] ?? I don't know man, I heard nothing about a [Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]. Are you sure did someone say [Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Get out
---
I agree with all of that. I'll probably grab a buff addon, maybe a bag one, possibly an action bar addon.
---
Once Classic official release date is announced the true preparation stage will begin, and addons will play a slightly larger roll in the community's discussion. I just hope the youtubers and big reddit posters remind their audiences that there is a time and a place for major QoL addons.
---
Hippogryphs, south-western Feralas. Rain, early morning. Sensory pleasure overload.
---
You're going to suffer ALOT of misses leveling DW. 2h may feel slow but its faster.
---
The great thing about addons is that if you don't like them you can simply choose not to use them!!
---
That sword looked pretty badass too
---
This place is lovely. Iirc there is a rare spawn turtle just north of there. And, of course, getting wrecked by Gammerita, mon! I thinl she was an elite?
---
Do not do engineering and alchemy. Herbs are SO expensive on vanilla, you NEED herbalism with alchemy. Herbalism and alchemy are amazing professions to have in vanilla: potions are KEY. They‚Äôre used like mad for end game raiding. Especially when getting to AQ and NAXX. You can make serious gold leveling with herb and alchemy and at end game, too. Major healing pots are a must have for raiding as are major mana pots. Some guilds require these each raid, so you‚Äôll make bank. They‚Äôre also needed for PVP if there are just strictly PVP guilds. The other money maker is enchanting. So if you wanna do engineering I would pair it with enchanting. 
---
Rogues require fadeleaf in order to use blind- constant money there. Purple lotus selfs for a shit ton for end game enchants, even. Think about it!
---
r/wowservers
---
That stuff is so good I wish it was craftable. Would need to be on a 24 hour cool down though.
---
Bad logic
---
Though I think with Blizz using the current client to base classic on, old add-ons won't work and they will have to be built from scratch.
---
Y‚Äôall know a lot about turtles...
---
I only had one hatchet with my hunter :(
---
Someone else using questie or has no effect on you whatsoever.
---
I will by no means go DW for levelling. It may feel great, but the lack of hit is not going to work well.
---
Dun dun dun, dun dun dun...
---
WORLD OF WARCRAFT!!!
---
I wouldn't say I was following blindly, more that I wanted to engage in the community (it was a fresh server launch) and got caught up over preparing. Thinking for ourselves is the message that I'm trying to send here. Seems like we're on the same page though.
---
Pservers are mostly barren. Maybe you experienced when one rolled out a fresh server. Regardless, a fight for quest items/resources, whatever, was a feature of vanilla.. hell, even a feature of BC. I don't like it, but I understand that's part of the flavor of that game and don't want it changed.
---
I did this. It was fun! Got a 3 day ban, though.
---
Blizzard can do absolutely nothing to servers hosted in Russia 
---
Haha i dont play BFA :D
---
But thanks for your respond, it is much appreciated.

The reason i really asked about gear overlap with tanks is i could imagine some warrior tanks wanting something i want in absense of other tank drops.
---
For some classes you can definitely go in with this mentality. Take a bear Druid for example. You can start enchanting for the Smoking Heart of the Mountain, pick up the Mark of Tyranny quest, and save up gold for a Warden Staff off of the AH.
---
Personally, I‚Äôll be picking up nature &amp; frost resistance gear for as early as possible to avoid later expenses.
---
PALADIN... WINS.
---
FLAWLESS VICTORY.
---
FATALITY!
---
^^^^Toastie!
---
I probably don't have time to raid so i'll do pvp, dungeons and just enjoy the world, do some grinding, level professions.
---
As a class i have enjoyed hunter when leveling, since it feels so laid back but damage seems really low and i like to have big bursts/crits. I enjoy the theme tho. I also enjoy being helpful for other people/in group, tend to heal but been enjoying pure dps classes too. I have played warlock on later expansions a lot but the lack of mobility kinda puts me off, especially all the ganking and world pvp going on in classic. I also enjoy other armors a lot more than cloth and always drool on warriors passing by. Plz help me, i am huge altoholic tho, but don't think i have time to level more than one class, maybe two at some point.

Nope, Stage 2 is when BGs will be added. So no BGs, AV included on release.

Tbh id love to play with nixxiom. But hes going pvp server and probably horde. I don‚Äôt mean follow him around all the time. I mean raiding and doing dungeons. I bet nixxiom could be an asset to a guild. 
---
Classic wow discord? Where does one find the info to that discord?
---
IMO the biggest things that are different for me as a healer is that in wrath they added "Overheal amount" to the log.   
---
We used to just guess the heal by reading the targets health before and after.
---
To be honest I think you are right overall. However, ktm and dmb would be a choice made between players who have already committed to playing together, so that's more case to case. I think you're on point with how 'stats' addons is sort of a slap in the face to hybrids.
---
Horde will always rule PvP and alliance will usually have the upper hand with PVE. As alliance leveling you‚Äôll probably get ganked by horde non stop. Bout it. Just changes of scenery different quests- personally I like alliance for leveling much better. 
---
Spot on answers, thanks, very appreciated.
---
Basically what im getting at is that isnt a matter of RNG. Blue and green are both colors, that doesnt mean everything is the same about them. If someone didnt want blue leaves and you said "but blue and green are both colors"...so what? Blue leaves dont feel good. You touched on why forging is a shitty form of RNG though, so clearly you get why people like one form of RNG and not another, and by extension, why "they're both RNG" isnt really a valid argument.

Only use consecration when Vengeance procs as well.

Hi, /u/Rozencrantze
---
Does it?  Every single time?  Even if someone was trying to hide something?  What other secrets of magic do you know?
---
Launch WoW through Steam's Big Picture Mode. You can then set your bindings there. I use an Xbox controller to play on vanilla servers and it works just fine. You won't be competitive but it's perfectly suitable for casual play. 
---
I can't tell if this is serious or a really bad attempt at satire

The Yeti cave in Hillsbrad Foothills. Spend a lot of time there for some reason.

Haha that sounds like a sick plan. Good luck! 
---
Very! ...to both statements 
---
go to r/wowservers for pserver questions
---
Oops, I really did mean disease :)
---
Yeah I read into integrating WOW with steam and it seemed like more of a project than I wanted to try.  But glad to know it works at least.  It's all a trick of getting motivated enough to try and work through it for awhile to set up =p
---
[Is this it?](http://us.media.blizzard.com/wow/media/comics/comic-2007-01-greystone-winner-large.jpg)

It really depends on the IT Department where you work.  Big companies tend to have separate teams for different things, which include a team of people that just manage the network.  If you try to go to Facebook and you get a message that it's blocked by "company name" network security, then your company's Net Security team obviously blocks it.  However, alot of companies don't block youtube and social media as much because they use them as marketing tools and employees need legit access to those sites.  
---
But, one thing network teams can do easily is track bandwidth usage.  They can weed out real quick users that are streaming music or videos because it uses a ton of bandwidth.  Running WoW while on your work network will spike your bandwidth usage plenty above normal employee use and give a network team enough reason to look into what you're doing.  That's why you have to go personal computer and public or personal network if you plan to run WoW while at work.
---
Agreed. Plenty of dps warriors. You don‚Äôt bring 8 prot warriors to garr. If you cant banish your fury warriors tank.

No need for welfare, it's pretty easy to cover rent as a contractor in 2-3 solid days of work per week and then game away to your hearts content.
---
Play windowed mode too. If you're in fullscreen there's a very noticeable delay and black screen as the desktop comes back, this is a clear giveaway you were up to something. In windowed mode you can instantly hide the WoW window.
---
The fact alone that there is no transmogged gear makes this picture beautiful 
---
I guess I got lucky but I'm still friends with a kid I met in Elementary school and were both rerolling for classic! Besides that I'd suggest trying to rope someone else you know in RL into classic. I've already convinced my roommate and a guy at the gym I climb with....
---
Depends what role you want to do.
---
Also 90-120 now has almost zero bearing on what a class was like in vanilla, so many abilities have been worked around there's only a few key similarities to the specs between then and now.
---
If you like DPS, rogue is good for both raiding and pvp, though for raiding you may find you have an excess of rogues competing for spots. Mage and hunter are also very good for both, though mage you'll feel a bit weak in the first raid, molten core, due to fire immunity.
---
Paladin you're stuck as a healer in raids unless you're friends with the GM, pvp you can do some nasty reckbombing and never die, but also take forever to kill without reckoning.
---
Warrior is /the/ tank of vanilla, some other classes /can/ do it, but your raids will have a warrior, and most dungeon groups will want a warrior. Fury is also viable dps early raiding, though they're also the most gear dependent, by late game BWL/naxx they can take the top of the charts once they've got the gear to scale with. They're also still pvp kings back then with mortal strike, though you'll need a pocket healer buddy if you want to last long.
---
specs, man, specs. what do you want to do? heal, damage, pillage?
---
what I can tell you is ret paladins are an entirely different beast then they were in WotLK and so are druids, especially resto. mage and warrior should be pretty similar, they tend to stay consistent through expansions. no idea about rogues, and hunters... no amount of balancing can save that class from it's playerbase.
---
wow I forgot those videos existed.. that's some hardcore nostalgia
---
I remember it like it was yesterday. I played at the end of bc and when lk was released my lock was 58. I refilled after hitting bc because rogues were dumpstering me. 
---
It was in the Bornean tundra if I‚Äôm not mistaken in a crevice in the ground there was 1-2 dungeon portals with flying bats outside of the crevice. I forget the name of the dungeon. There was always max lvls dueling while I was leveling and I used to ambush the losers and had a god damn blast doing it. Ughh the memories of no lifting and ganking lol
---
Meanwhile on the flip side alchemy combines demand very low costs because alchemy is wicked easy to level, and outside of flasks and Elixir of Brute force all the good recipes are easy to come by. If you can only take herb or alchemy, the right choice is herbalism every time.
---
The biggest difference you notice when leveling as Alliance is their terrible FP and town locations for many zones. 
---
This, and the design of the world map, create more pvp exploited zones on Alliance side. Certain zones are known the camped by horde ... sometimes full time and with dedicated twinks.
---
Alliance has easier access to end game dungeons and raids however, and better class raid mechanics.
---
If on a pve server, the main difference will be the increased running, countered by typically better quest chains and scripted events. Many feel Alliance is the better RP experience. Of course Horde is meant to feel more rough by design anyway.
---
That female dwar though üòÇ
---
Chuck and Bobby, got some OGs in that guild
---
Saaaaaaame, ran in like crazy on my warrior, got one sword pretty quick but lost the roll on the second twice before finally getting it in my early 50s.
---
Replaced it with ice barb spear as soon as I got into AV

It‚Äôs in community info or the sidebar on this subreddit
---
I had to look it up to be sure... priests still amaze balls.
---
Just those pesky hunters with viper sting o.O
---
I thought sometimes inside the IF throne room a giant door would open up, and there was stairs down somewhere. 
---
Was that a thing? If so what was that? 
---
Was it Alliance heavy?
---
Ohh ok. Im on mobile atm. Ill check it out when i get off work.
---
Sure it makes it easier. STUPID easier is prolly an overstatement.  
---
Read Ion's post from 2006. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080818233400/http://elitistjerks.com:80/f15/t9383-raiding\_consumables\_dilemma/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080818233400/http://elitistjerks.com:80/f15/t9383-raiding_consumables_dilemma/)  
---
I've posted this a million times and still people don't understand that using consumables to go from a "Pre-bis gear level" to a "Naxx level" strength is absolutely the biggest cause behind the trivialization of content. No one consumed until like, later bwl or aq40.  Look at world first MC. He had poisons, mark of the wild, stamina, and 2 consumables. He wasn't even using a FOOD buff.  
---
If you want a true vanilla molten core experience. Roll in there with 30 people in 8/8 dungeon gear, 5 people who aren't even 60, 5 people who can't stay online, and 0 consumables.   
---
Related question, what would happen if every member of a 40 man raid had max engineering and dropped the mechanical whelp at the same time in a boss fight? How significant would the dps be?
---
I always play windowed anyways. 
---
Also keep in mind it'll be rough for you to get into groups leveling up not wanting to tank.
---
A majority of tanks leveling up will be warriors if they can get one, and not many warriors want to compete too much for gear, so they probably won't invite you.
---
Very much this, you're going to need to tank 1-3 times in most raids in vanilla. Not to mention if you make it to naxx and the horesman.... Without being a "tank" when needed your not worth bringing over a rogue.
---
I use alt+W for auto run.
---
But don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs those same wankers that will abuse the auto report button if Blizzard really adds one.
---
Good time to be the IT Admin of my company üòé Will grind mage levels all day at work! Workload is usually slow during summer.
---
Ooh, something I've been working on. You can take it to its \[logical conclusion\]([https://i.imgur.com/av4cs0e.png](https://i.imgur.com/av4cs0e.png))
---
With normal WASD/ESDF, your thumb hits space and your pinky finger hits modifiers (and really only ctrl OR space).
---
Your pinky finger hits space plus a littany of other keys. Your thumb hits all the modifiers and combinations of modifiers, and they're ALL comfortable to hit.  Ctrl+Alt? Ctrl+Shift+Alt? Easy.
---
It takes a day or two to get used to, but it opens up vastly more keybinds, and once you're used to it it feels very second-nature.
---
It actually works a little \*too\*-well. I hardly bind any useful actions to my pinky finger, because I just use my mouse. plus modifiers for 90% of my spells. I have 3 thumb buttons, which, when paired with all the modifier keys is already 24 possible actions. Throw in a mouse wheel and you're already at 50 actions with just mouse and modifier keys.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat.
---
Ctrl over Alt? Is your left pinky another thumb or something?
---
Ion actually said that they will limit some of the modern addons because the people at Blizzard doesn't feel like they fit into the classic WoW experience. But we have to wait and see the extent of the addons/systems they will block.
---
Get yourself a steam controller, thank me later
---
Do you recall if the whelps would break Gouge and Blind in PvP? It's kind of a moot point as there are better pre-raid blues and I've always assumed that they did, but I've never actually used one.
---
The Green Tower was my first epic too!
---
1. A good dps warrior that comes fully prepared to the raid is always in very high demand. The issue is that it requires a lot time and effort to be one of those warriors.
---
2. 2h is only viable as horde if you have a shaman in your group.
---
3. Warriors is by far the worst class to solo farm. Gathering and selling tank services is probably your best options for making gold.
---
4. Warrior tier gear is itemized for tanks, most dps plate is garbage, so you'll be rolling for leather most of the time. There's also hardly any good gear for warriors in MC, you'll be stuck with mostly pre-raid gear til BWL.
---
Yes, and some heavy action in there, tons of people fighting tons of things, shitloads of lag and DC
---
I thought that was how level 60 endgame looked like, and was looking forward to it... got to level 60, but didn't get anything like that. Got to Silithus on my own, but there was nobody there.
---
And, with time... I forgot about that. Until I read about the AQ event, 12 years later...
---
Also, I was quite surprised, why did the guy in Ironforge, exchanging bandages for reputation and equipment, just disappear like that...
---
This is something for those who want to roll rogue/shaman/warrior to consider because if you are raiding you'll be combat/fury/resto. So if you want to pvp between raids that's 100g every week. I think all other classes can pretty much use the same spec for both tasks.  
---
Already confirmed the add-on UI will be different than it was in vanilla.
---
You can just become "that guy who talks to me while doing some work" and people will just shrug it off. Take EXTRA long to switch your eyes from the screen and people will lose suspicion and just chalk it up as a character quality
---
Do yourself a favor and get a 10 or 12 button mouse. Then custom set those mouse buttons to ctrl+shift numbers 1-9&amp;0. As a hunter, I set my traps, feign death, raptor strike, scatter shot and my most used shots to the mouse buttons. Then I put my pots &amp; most used aspects on my main bar. As a priest. I set my wand to mouse button 1, and then all my most used ranks of my heals to the mouse buttons. Then, I put my water on 1, my offensive spells and pots and CDs on that same action bar.
---
Yes, I hated that. I hated that Ironforge, regardless of being a major hub, was not giving rested XP. What was worse, I remembered logging out with the Zzz on my level, and when logging back in, there was almost no rested XP...
---
of course they can lol.  if you connect phone wifi to work network, they can see EVERY piece of data (text, picture, browsing history) on your phone.  
---
If you are connecting work laptop to home wifi, they can see everything on other devices connected to your personal wifi, if they wanted to.  
---
Just always remember, if you are connected, they can see EVERYTHING

In reply to the actual post, I came to WoW from City of Heroes - so I actually based my binds around that, which made more sense to me at the time.  To this day, I still use R for auto run and Backspace to reply to whispers.
---
I always play with my fingers on the home row keys (pinkie on the A key, sometimes shift, index on F, which makes my reach pretty decent for some far keybinds.
---
Typically I run with a setup like this:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
| s-1 | s-2| s-3| s-4| s-5| s-6 |s-Q| s-E | s-T | s-Z | s-F | F | G | s-G | s-X | s-C | s-V | MB4 | - | a-1 | a-2 | a-3 | - | -

---
|1     | 2     | 3     |    4 | 5 | 6 | Q | E | T | Z | MMB
---
Not that fast. Even on pservers which have a ‚Äúmore serious‚Äù player base according to some, I have gotten loads of stuff for under vendor price. Without addons.
---
I don't have an exact memory, but I'm pretty sure the whelp could and did break CC. So basically you think the whelp is your friend but it's actually evil and hates you.
---
yikes
---
Were there no threat meters in vanilla? I thought I had one, I at least had one in early TBC...
---
My top left is full of the ctrl/alt keys. Usually filled with CC spells and trinkets, pvp shit.
---
But yeah you can get screwed with the multi-main bar system. Not very often though.
---
Ion hasn't played this content for over a decade, we have. He was a lawyer with money who ran a website who followed other peoples strats and he pressed chainheal on the easiest pve healer and he didn't even play elemental or pvp at a high level. I really don't care what he has to say about anything to be honest. Anyone on this forum could have done what he did with a super nintendo controller. The modern game is also awful and I can't imagine anyone worse in charge of modern WoW than him. He made raiding all that matters and alienated everyone but people like him who are delusional enough to think WoW PVE can ever be a real esport, when they fail at real esport games.
---
You are too stressed, my friend. You should find peace and solace wherever you may. Heroes must keep their strengths up, and spirits high, for to neglect one's peace of body and mind, is a sure path of failure.
---
So... rest.
---
\*\* selects the water, because \[Darnassian Bleu\] is quite useless for Druids \*\*
---
\*\* clicks "Complete Quest" \*\*
---
\*\* logs out \*\*
---
I will add too that I did a bit of preparation.  I took my existing keybinds and basically prioritized which abilities I used the most / needed to have accessible.  
---
For a warrior in the mid 30s, I threw out zerker and defensive stance for PVE as they're barely applicable.  I just got my WW axe so I'm definitely only using WW axe in PVE and doing the '1 mob to pool rage, then pull two with a lot of rage and cleave/sweeping strikes' method.  
---
I listed out the abilities like I said and ranked the most important ones.  Then I sketched a picture of the controller and basically slotted in where I wanted to have each button.  I used the number pad and some other useless keyboard keys to bind as secondary inputs via the default in-game keybind menu, and then used the keybinding software to match those secondary keys to the controller inputs.  It only took me about an hour and a good chunk of that was getting myself up to speed on the windows program (JoyToKey) and how it worked.  
---
I hit my big snag when trying to loot =)
---
You don‚Äôt lose out due to deposits you lose out from the cut. You only lose the deposit if the item doesn‚Äôt sell.
---
Yes and back in the days u could even talk to people that was mind controlled
---
lol word, I LOVE the concept for hunters and they seem interesting. But every time I try one on a private server and I get stuck in the dead zone I just rage quit
---
I have the dumbest keybinds on retail. I switch bars in combat, I hold down A S and both mouse buttons to strafe, I use Z and X for abilities, still haven't remapped R to something useful in combat. Someone save me from this madness. 
---
Yes, it's a trick raiding guilds have been using for years.
---
&gt;	I expect population will be pretty even on PVP servers (Horde was vastly ounumbered in old Vanilla) and will heavily favor alliance on PVE servers. 
---
This. 
---
I originally leveled Alliance as PvE and Horde as PvP.
---

On the right bars, I'll use ` for my mount, a-` for my flying mount (or potions in classic), and s-Space is usually for taunts.
---
I remember this in classic, you're 100% right. However things have changed and I promise you there will be some badass druids in classic, i'm actually maining one myself
---
I wonder if classic will bring back the old bugs. Like glitching behind the door in the throne room to get to Old IF
---
Even if its so rare my guildies still get to loot 420s from a base 370 and 415s from base 400 content. Its not a nice bonus and it being "rare" (which is absolutely not the case) does not make it okay. You don't get randomly rewarded for doing nothing in the real world so it shouldn't be this way in WoW. If I'm killing a raid boss with my guild there's no reason I get a 400 belt and another guy gets a 415. We completed the exact same content together. Not to mention the entire Titanforging system allows players to complete content by overgearing it instead of overcoming the challenge. Upgrades should be coming from you completing harder content, not you sticking to your comfort zone and farming content trivial to you. So yes, for all the above, the current situation is a nightmare. Rarity has nothing to do with it.
---
Kresh‚Äôs back or something like that lol?
---
Meters did this before-hand.
---
KTM was available in vanilla, pretty sure it predated BWL launching...
---
In general in premade vs. premade you bring something like...
---
2 priests
---
2 warriors
---
1 each of every other class
---
There's some flexibility here, but in general that's a strong framework for a comp.
---
Your druid goes to run the flag and your rogue waits in your base to intercept the other team's flag carrier (probably a druid and possibly a mage). They will do everything they can to delay the druid and let the team know which direction he is running in. The hunter will swing back to help kill the druid FC if the rogue can't take it.
---
You really want your paladin (alliance might bring two with the extra one being in place of the second priest) to help heal in mid and control the fight there. Sure, when your premade is just farming PUGs you can bring pretty much any combination of classes and specs that you want, but when you come up against another premade you are going to want whatever paladins you have healing in mid.
---
Nice story brother. What motorcycle are you going to get? 
---
I am going to be so consumed by classic i'm afraid I wont even ride!
---
However since its coming out in summer the summers here are absolutely devastating for me, so it works out in the end I guess!
---
Wait, what?! I remember I couldn't equip any ranged
---
Pick up a fishing rod, go to some place with little to no traffic, resize your window so only the fishing bomber shows. Alt tab between wow and everything else, keyboard shortcut to cart your rod, click the bobber when you hear or see a splash.
---
Even if you end up only clicking it 1 in 5 times you're going to be coming home with some extra gold.
---
It's more about the 5man dungeons than the raid. A good raid group will have 6-8 warrior potentially, and IF you can prove to be the most dedicated and highest dps fury one then you can probably avoid tanking on most fights because Fury DPS is so good anyway.
---
But dungeons... you really will need to learn to throw on prot gear and a shield and tank 5 mans because otherwise you'll be waiting around for years for a group, unless you happen to befriend a nice Feral Druid.
---
I think thats the point though, they would be incredibly OP if they didn't have that weakness. You lose mana fast but all your mana is used for great cause. 
---
yes, that's how datamining works. they can't just hide some secret quests somewhere.
---
I want a spot in a raid group and I want to be able to go into PvP matches and kill more than I die. I'll play whatever let's me do that.
---
All my inactive characters are still on Malygos to this day, loved this realm then, and love it to death now.
---
I mean that's fine and all but everyone you know sees you as a manchild
---
/who z-"GM Island"
---
When has Blizzard catered to streamers? Besides restoring items they refuse to restore to others, thats the only one I could think of
---
Sounds like a nice way to be left alone. Where abouts do you jump over?
---
If my memory serves my correctly, yes it was!
---
&gt; If I know from the moment I roll exactly where the spec lands in the hierarchy, then it's pretty damn tough to get motivated and excited about leveling a bottom tier character. 
---
That's the whole allure to no changers like me. I'm getting *exactly* what I expect, with no blind-siding, group dynamic shifting changes coming out of the wings and shuffling things about in unpredictable ways. I don't think it's that people who are against any changes don't consider the "excitement" of an uncertain future...I think we just very quickly discard it, because (at least to me) it really has no allure. We're not excited for Classic WOW because of a *lack* of knowledge of the future, but because it's a return to what we *do* know. So being sad that there will be no more 'surprise! update!' patch notes doesn't even blip my radar.
---
Shift doesnt have any cooldown in vanilla. And if you spec into natural shapeshifter it doesnt cost that much. Besides, there is a trinket in BWL that gives you free shapeshifting for 20 sec with 5 min cooldown. It's really easy to get too, drops from second boss like every week and it's between you and the other druid to roll for.
---
You really owe it to yourself to level at least one alliance character to 30. The narrative and questing quality of Westfall, Redridge, and Duskwood is some of the best content in the game.
---
Hmm, and I was overjoyed about mining a vein while standing on it...
---
Hi, /u/TheBra305
---
To be fair I seriously wonder just for which class OP *is* talking. Basically all casters have downrank shenenigans, and *actually useful* situational spells were most plentiful in vanilla. Combine that with a few macro's and an absolute truckload of useful consumables and many classes won't have much issue filling out their bars completely.
---
good smelling
---
Man, he really imagined a lot extra onto that comic.
---
Downranking is certainly going to be a strange concept for people coming to Classic from retail.  That quick Frostbolt or cheap Earth Shock interrupt is just so good, though.
---
Warrior. Shit while leveling, shit in 1v1 and shit if you don't have an epic 2 hander. And the fact that it's the most played class just makes it even more shit to play
---
then shadowmeld just before the game starts, and take the flag once everyone leaves the base
---
Really hoping the Make Love Not Warcraft reference didn't go over everyone's heads. 
---
Change the MK dragon symbols at the top to horde/alliance symbols.  
---
&gt; What people seem to forget is that the whole point of PvP is for two people to engage in combat and at the end only one person gets to walk away alive.
---
I'd say it's made for large group wpvp battles, always the most fun and dynamic battles in the game. And I should say, every class can contribute, even a low level can preform a rez and have a significant impact on the battle.
---
Maybe it's just me but I think this is a terrible analogy. People who think they should have every single thing that someone else has without putting in the work for it are the reason wow is in its current state.

Loot in WoW is already a slot machine.

We had a guildmate who was this ~53 yr old woman who played with her grandson. One day after submitting a ticket for something the GM accidentally gave her the &lt;GM&gt; title in front of her name, icon and all. 
---
After getting spammed by the entire server with questions, she submitted another ticket to have the title removed.
---
They removed the title but then every mob she killed dropped between 3-5 gold. I don't need to tell anyone how crazy that was.
---
The next day she gets a warning from blizzard saying that she was exploiting the mobs and she better not do it again.
---
Poor old woman was so upset for blizzard blaming her for their own mistakes that she quit a month later.
---
A glitch that happened to me was that in one warsong BG, on my hunter who wasn't an engineer...i respawned after a death with every mechanical pet following me, including that little dragon and yeti that would attack anything in sight.
---
They didn't persist after the BG ended but i was certainly confused and delighted lol.
---
Ill be doing skinning and herb. Ill feed a buddy with all my herbs and vender most leather while leveling. 
---
Once 60 Ill farm all the leather ill need for the handful of LW crafted pieces ill be needed. Then drop skinning for enchanting. Keeping Herb for money, and pots via my friend
---
There are guilds who use this on Instructor Razuvious to make it easier to pick up all the adds and get the fight organized.  
---
Once the MC rotation on Instructor is started, it's fairly easy if people have discipline and there are tanks on standby in case of resists. The actual beginning of the fight is the chaotic part because everyone has to get organized with their MCs and get agro started on instructor.  
---
fair.
---
They don't cater to them in retail, why would Classic be any different.
---
Streamers like Alexensual will be corpse camped. 
---
I only see an increase in cooperation with Youtube and Twitch for promotional reasons. Those 2 platforms are the future of game coverage (for the foreseeable future anyway).
---
And no, it's not to provide services in game to them that nobody else gets. lol
---
That's just corruption.
---
Didn't expect that reaction, but that's ok.
---
Give them more common weapons for goodness sake
---
I wanted a more iconic approach since it's a fighting game, but I get what you mean.
---
I've made I don't know how many NE during the past 14 years but I have no idea what goes on in Darkshore
---
This happened to me too!
---
That's mild compared to what they *could* do if they went all George Lucas on the game..
---
There was no way to open the door pre-Cata, but you could use a similar bug like the one in the OP to duel people in its proximity, and stuff like Polymorph or Fear allowed you to pass through the door.
---
Still better than what actiblizz will probably do with the game once the tourists start their tantrums.
---
you cant judge a ret pallies damage by seconds. since it is so low you need to up it to a minute time frame
---
Yea, was an elite. The rare is called Ironback
---
I did this on my lock back when you could purchase level 70 glad gear while levelling so that you could get your welfare set ready for when you dinged. Joined 69 queue, dinged, put glad gear on and became immortal. Was so much fun! 
---
Profs: If you pvp, Enhancement Shaman is near useless without Engineering vs having it. If you have no rush to cap it early, level using Skinning and Mining. Skinning for the gold. Bank enough mining comps to level Eng later but sell what you don't need.
---
Farming: With skinning, they can farm Desolace Hyena Packs easily with their aoe assisting them. Also, please use Rockbiter while leveling and grinding. WF will be your fun buff to use once you get enough +hit. It's not worth using against mobs before that. Fine for pvp though as weapon skill isn't calculated and it will proc more.
---
Tanking: Shamans can tank most dungeons eventually. You typically have to out level the dungeon and/or outgear the dungeon by quite a lot. Consider it a later game gimmick.
---
Pvp: Shamans are built to benefit any group as support even if Enhancement. An immediate benefit to a lone Shaman however, would be any class that helps peel enemies off of the shaman or cc's them so the melee Shaman can catch up. This is why Engineering is so important to a Shaman; because of their weakness to being rooted.
---
Honestly the best approach would be to get hired by Blizzard to work on Classic WoW. Then your boss won't be able to tell if you're doing real work or just screwing around on the live servers.

[reminds me of my old gal](https://i.redd.it/qjabqsfupdq11.jpg) 
---
Dirty fuckin dangles boys
---
that female dwarf thumbnail though...
---
My rotation basically uses a variation of this formula with all of my classes:
---
\- Bottom left: The 3-4 primary abilities of my single-target rotation
---
\- Bottom center: The 3-4 primary abilities of my AoE rotation, arranged so I can basically just slide my hand four keys to the right and continue as I was with my AoE version
---
\- Bottom right: My interrupts/crowd control/shit I hope my guild doesn't ask me to use because my poor fingers aren't long enough to reach in time
---
\- All of my CDs arranged in the top row, but I can't keep track of that many buttons so I have to manually click with my mouse those which is the only purpose my entire right hand serves in this scenario
---
\- My mount and health potion at the end of the CD row
---
And the real kicker is that my left hand is responsible for 90% of my casting AND my movement bound to WASD so instead of like a 1-2-3-4 rotation it's more like 1-WW-2-AS-3-DD-4-"OH FUCK sorry you died, my bad on the healz", which I also just took time out of my casting rotation to type in the middle of a boss fight.
---
He only says that the content of mc/bwl was built around a raid that didn't use even 1/3 the number of consumes available to them. 
---
The point i'm making is that when you fully consume, it's like you are going into MC with Naxx gear. That's the biggest problem. ***NOT*** dire maul or 1.12 talents. Although they are not insignificant to player's throughput.
---
You could even buff them yourself as the priest using the mind control; the buff would go off before the mind control cancelled.
---
It just takes 15 minutes for them to finish the 1v1...
---
Paladin T2. Hands down.
---
They didn't really have mana issues in TBC and weren't overpowe-
---
Oh wait, yeah,  they were incredibly powerful üòÇ
---
I did something similar back in BC to get better in arena and have stuck with it since then and can't imagine doing anything else.
---
Q,W,E,R,D,S,A are core rotational abilities/interrupts/common utility buttons
---
1, 2, 3, 4, s-1, s-2, s-3, s-4, s-Q, s-W, s-R, s-E, s-D, s-A are cooldowns/trinkets/consumables
---
I move with mouse and strafe with the side buttons on it.
---
The Warrior T3, Paladin T2, and Shaman T3 are all pretty great. I'm not sure how I'd order those three, but overall I think I like the Paladin sets the best. The T 0.5 is sick, I actually think the Bananadin T1 set looks really good though some don't like it much, and the Paladin T3 is better than any other T3 except the two mentioned above. Shaman T1 is also pretty cool, but none of their others really grab me. I definitely gravitate toward the bulky plate aesthetic.
---
I think I know what you mean, but can you clarify what "all George Lucas" would mean?
---
As a hunter who still gets a hard on the T2 dragon stalker set, Pally T2 is best-looking set in the game.
---
They will take any healers they can get their hands on unless it's uber hardcore poopsockers

As a class? Probably Shaman, I like all 3 of their sets.  Best individual set for me is probably Tier 3 Hunter, Tier 2 Priest or Tier 1 Warrior.

I remembering being able to start duels inside IF back there :)

Malygos was my first server.  I probably still have some alts there.

The firefox private mode literally says "Private Browsing doesn‚Äôt make you anonymous on the Internet. Your employer or Internet service provider can still know what page you visit." in bold whenever you open it up
---
If I were to, for a completely random example, use my work PC to remote into my PC at home, is there any way IT would be able to know what I'm doing on my home desktop?
---
Thats a trick, nobody knows that because no one on retail has played Shaman in over 6 months
---
This.  The quests alliance side much better including the BRD quests.  
---
So let's nerf it more and break it even more? Awesome logic. Are you Ion per chance? Sounds like the flawed argument he would make with his lawyer speak.
---
Raiding has to be just hard enough to require a guild. If not the game breaks. All these nerfs could potentially break it. Ion would know that if he had played in the last decade. 
---
Watch TV/Netflix/Hulu/etc on a 2nd monitor.
---
Thanks for the information, especially the suggestion for gathering then swapping to engineering. 
---
Couldn't agree more. Wow classic should have been released 15 years ago, slightly before the release of normal vanilla!
---
This mentality seems strange to me esp as people who enjoy vanilla. I don't get mad if someone in my raid gets an upgrade and I don't. I don't get upset if someones BiS trinket drops sky rocketing their power and mine hasn't ever dropped.  I don't get mad that someone gets a legendary and I don't.  
---
When my guild gets upgrades it makes the raid stronger and it's all tied to RNG. No matter how much hard work I put in there's no guarantee that I will get item X. Just like with titan forging it's tied to RNG. And as far as farming trivial content for upgrades well vanilla is full of that. Sometimes blues from easy content are better then epics for a long time lol.  
---
Retail has alot of problems for sure but as two people who love classic (assuming this since were both here) your mentality just seems strange to me. But maybe you don't enjoy those aspects of classic either IDK.
---
Yup, the strength of this game is that it is accessible while also being challenging enough to be fun and able to play with your friends/family.
---
At the end of the day, this game will be about the people you play with and the relationships you forge within the game.  You will take on different roles to achieve your goals and that is part of the beauty of the experience.  Having this opportunity to go through the game all over again with all the knowledge of having done it, but enough time removed since the last time you did it will give it a refreshing feeling of being sort of new again, but with the knowledge this is something you know you can do and bring others along to make the experience better.
---
People keep talking about that first Epic, my most vivid memory was getting my first mount, I know I spent the next several hours just blasting 80's rock anthems and tearing up and down the roads of Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom
---
Just hold on to it until prices rise?
---
shaman or bench.
---
You should definitely roll Alliance for the NEW factor. I was always Horde as well. I rolled Alliance on Emerald Dream back in the day (RIP) and it was a blast. 
---
I could really enjoy Vanilla even more because I didn't know the zones/cities at all, especially the lower level stuff. Even the higher level stuff is different because of the different encampments/quests etc..
---
Exactly, stay woke fam
---
Ya i dunno wtf class he is playing but most classes will have more buttons than on live just because they will have the spells from different specs, as well as possibly different ranks of spells on casters. Also random stuff that have been cut from the game altogether. There will also be profession things useable again like grenades, engi helmet, etc.
---
All the queues and failed esports that caused homogenization are in big part  due to streamers and that community.  The Classic WoW streamers are already trying to ruin things again and create "Classic Esports". All they care about is their content and they want their JOB to ruin our RECREATION. Streamers are a plague for gaming. They have also in big part caused the death of single player games, because people watch single player games instead of buying them and playing them. The day twitch dies games will be in a better place.
---
Is this the guy from WC? Pretty sure I had him as my pet, I know I got some turtle pet from WC on my hunter in vanilla. His name was boat :)
---
Become gold seller. 
---
Wrong! I'm not in the closet.
---
lol you poor thing
---
My best glitch ever was when I found out a way to get to mount hyjal or the troll camp north of it. It was a harsh path where eventually you had a big drop with a little pool of water at the bottom. Paladins and priest had a easy way to get there with bubble and float. But any class could do it if you were good enough to drop in the pool of water barely deep enough so you wouldn't die. Once in the impossible to get there troll camp l, you could farm the neutral trolls over and over, they respawned really fast, without risk of dying. We used to pull them all at once with 2 warlocks. I got my first wold drop there, the mighty fire breathing shield. Good memories.
---
No. Shapeshifting way to hard for woman, too many buttons they can confuse.
---
Paladin the way for these players.
---
She's a dime piece for sure.
---
Strangely I don't remember my first!
---
I never got any world drops or bought any on the A.H.
---
I think it might have been Don Julio's Band from AV rep or Flameguard Gauntlets since i joined an MC guild right at 60.
---
Priest Tier 3 - Faith 
---
Pro tip: pet attack is off the gcd and you can macro it to hunters mark to get in combat quicker. 
---
I'll take the Dreadnought for 2 thousand, Alex
---
Ret was always a meme also in 2005
---
Nah that will be streamers when people realize they can have a life of their own and talk to people like guildmates instead of putting memes in a chat taht will never see it and that doesn't care. Also expect single player game makers to start blocking content like Nintendo often does. Vanilla WoW also doesn't separate family and friends with laughable raid mechanics so that some autistic people can feel like they play a real esport. Retail WoW is 100 percent going to die from Classic. You can book that now. It's also going to make the streamers worthless and if they fight for certain things that harms the community, just so they have easy content for their JOB? They will have huge pushback and lose a lot of money. I can give you a few examples that some big names have already lobbied for. I am going to laugh when he tries it again once all the players come back who don't care about streamers because they have a real life.
---
I do because I actually did the quests once.
---
I feel like a nostalgic boomer for saying that but I like old game graphics so much more.
---
Mouse keys for some primary abilities, then 1 2 3 4 5 6 primary ability, VCFRQE for some other utility. Shift + etc for the rest. Pretty simple.
---
GCD I meant, good post, good info 
---
Just keybind ALL keys to Frostbolt
---
I don‚Äôt have a link but they said it will be the old gross graphics.
---
Use the touchpad
---
I remember this was abused for awhile to "hop" up to the 2nd level of the WSG room before the match actually started.  If you were fast enough, you could make it to the enemy flagroom while they were still locked in
---
My impression is hunter suck dick every raid and are only taken because 40 Living humans are hard to gather
---
Locks are ok at first and become even more ok
---
We have this in Canada its called Roll up the Rim at Tim Hortons lol.
---
The scene is exactly the same but i remember it being more ...artsy? Meaning the art was more high level, i gotta find it. But thanks!
---
It is not silly to say that if it is true
---
I was a clicker from Vanilla-CATA there is no way I'm going back to that, I would rather play on dial up
---
tier 1 warrior over tier 3 warrior? thats a first o.o
---
Cool! I never knew people actually did this!
---
I didn't say that they didn't. I said that they were extremely limited compared to what they can do now. It's just a technical limitation of the client. 
---
Dwarf priest and Holy man in a dress
---
I‚Äôm getting flashbacks of Illegal Danish 2: Escape From Orgrimmar.
---
i would agree if it the legplates werent skirts. its always been my biggest gripe 
---
I know there are other cases where people use them, but I'm not super experienced in raiding, and I only knew about the Instructor one because I saw it in a video.  
---
I play from work, just make sure you have a good VPN, I use NORDvpn but I hear ExpressVPN is also decent, anyways it 100% works.
---
I mean it's good but there's no Netherwind mage
---
.... I'm gonna need to cancel the last two things on the order
---
Honestly I just want to nuke people in AV without trying too hard for gear. I also want to level easily and get gold easily. Hunter seems to fit the bill in almost all of these.
---
pessimism intensifies 
---
Shaman T2 is also pretty sick 
---
You can type /r for whispers and free that hotkey.
---
It's discretionary spending. Who cares what we think of how they spend it?
---
It's no coincidence that so many friendships were formed in early WoW that last, while so few are formed now. They are "associations" and not friends. To progress in modern WoW I have to leave family and friends behind to play with a small demographic of players where interests aren't shared, humor isn't shared and nothing is shared outside progression. If I leave that progression the association stops. Meanwhile all the old guildmates I had back then are on my steam list and we play Apex etc.
---
In my last mythic guild when I still raided, I listened to music every raid. I showed up, we did the content, then cleared until ilvl and then the game was over. It's horrible MMO design and endgame. The only person I really liked in the guild was a girl who was always benched during progress that always helped everyone she could. I am older and married but she was a nice person. Doesn't matter though. She didn't do Dance Dance Revolution good enough so she only got brought when it was on farm and was treated like a second class citizen. GREAT GAME DESIGN. She eventually quit as well. Don't blame her.
---
I would like to play mainly PvP and definitely focus on healing only, thus I was debating Holy Paladin or Holy Priest on Alliance. I would prefer Pally for aesthetics as I would have to roll dwarf priest cuz its so good in PvP in case I picked priest. But I am a special snowflake and I dont want to have a lot of my class around all the time. I fear that Alliance will be overflooded with Paladins and tbh I like the diversive toolkit of priest better than pally for the most part. 
---
My question is that whether is it true that we will see a lot of Pallies around and that I should roll priest, because its a more useful class overall, even though it might be a bit worse than hpalla in pvp (As ive heard that hpal is the king of pvp healz).
---
I once had a dream I was playing a shaman, orc or tauren defending GM. I was charging around ike a warrior but I also had lightning chain, lightning shield with a massive hurricane following me; AKA Windfury SSJ3 and  lightning bolt.
---
As I leaped around Thunder appeared at my feet. Was using a 2H too.
---
Felt like Thor tbh.
---
I too have had the Thor dream.
---
The best thing you can do is switch from WSAD to EDSF.
---
Then you can reach half of the keyboard and still use Shift, Control and Alt as modifiers.
---
Sadly after all those years of gaming it requires A LOT of practice and determination.
---
The only updates will be what the updated engine provides (new shadows and water basically) and that will be optional. Everything will be original.
---
See this: https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8136-Restoring-History-Creating-WoW-Classic-Panel#_
---
So much win
---
Based off the demo, it's old view distances, but new graphics. Graphics came with a setting that completely reverted them back to what it was in actual Vanilla. 
---
No updated models or spell effects, just better environmental detail + shadows, and the new water effects. 
---
Do you mean to say someone's benign advice about keybindings you disagree with doesn't set you into rage mode, too?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8len44/mage_you_should_try_try_leveling_as_arcane
---
lol i never even fucking knew this
---
My keybindings have always been
---
Q E R F for spells/abilities i use often
---
Shift + Q E R F for things with cooldowns
---
Z X C V For emergency buttons/long ass cooldowns
---
1 2 3 4 5 for buffs and other ulitity stuff.
---
You should post a spec for mages that's centered around arcane missiles. Would love to see it.  
---
Dal Rends with +15 ago enchants was where it was at.  Extra points for all the salt from combat rogues.
---
This is a really good point. If I'm tanking, I'm not taking another mail/plate class unless they understand I'm ML and all the gear I need is mine.
---
If you want loot, tank for it.
---
If you play fury you will be expected to tank for parts in every raid still. You will start dual wielding since you'll be wearing the same gear as rogues: DM hit ring, Dal'rends, Devilsaur, Truestrike, Satyr's Bow etc. all preraid BIS.
---
The models are older (and better looking imo because you play pretty far zoomed out anyways and animations is all that matters) but the game has many of the improvements as an option. Example. World textures, which would be things like books. New lighting which is completely an option with the shadow setting. HBAO + which is the ultra AO setting and that makes shadows more lifelike. New AA techniques. Direct X 11 water which features tessellation/ripples, modern foliage that moves and has physics. It's all optional.
---
Some people got into some newer zones in the demo.

Oh awesome! Thank you!

Go back to the twitch chat and pretend you have friends or that the streamer cares about you or that you are a real community. Type in all caps in hopes they see it...
---
Wow classic looks really good!! 
---
There was a private server that had arena master chest respawn under standard 6 minutes timer, and also a cross-faction \[1. General\] chat with no delay-between-messages. Imagine that salt in Stranglethorn Vale...
---
Myself, I quite found it fun. All that talk about "Arena Maestros" and "sappers". Then I took the boat to Booty Bay, and there, some guy was checking some troll's gender, by asking "do you shave your legs" - a girl was supposed to say "no, I depilate".
---
Regardless of if that is the case or not that isn't what the thread is about. 
---
I'm so excited for classic.  I finally decided to play a rogue this time around!  I thought it would be so fun to level up my poisons and do the quests.
---
I did paladin first and had an ABSOLUTE BLAST as I fumbled through figuring out how the game worked.  The one sword quest in WPL/EPL that makes you run all over to get that badass blue glowing sword is easily one of my most memorable quests, that or the epic mount quest journey into scholomance.
---
I wonder what it will be when i do my rogue?
---
I really hate tier 3 warrior, it looks janky and like a DK set. 
---
"It won't be the same"
---
Except it will be. Just like it's been the same every time I've played Vanilla on private servers.
---
Yeah I am a purist when it comes to gameplay but I really like the new water and foilage. I will probably turn shadows to low to preserve the original lighting and I like that glowy look on trees but it's nice that it's there for people who never got used to or saw the old primitive shadow system. All they know is the new one so that might be the one they love. It's great to have options. :)
---
How did you stream your home pc ?
---
Oldschool Runescape
---
How did you use remote desktop on your phone ?
---
Hi, /u/adivirgi
---
Honestly that makes sense, I just always thought my quote was what he was saying all these years. 
---
Arcane Missles take mana up front so if you move or get countered you lose the mana. There is no relatable way to increase damage that doesn't effect other the elements also. Fire can take deep Arcane and get a 3 second cast time (with  and get 70% chance not to lose cast time and ignite and imp scorched for 15% increased fire damage. Frost can get 2.5 cast time, 100% critical damage, and 6% flat increase on frost damage with deep arcane. Plus neither fire or frost put a debuff on the target.
---
In my experience, there aren't any remote desktop type software out there that can handle allowing you to game from a remote session.  Everything will be fine on your screen until you launch the game and try to play it.  It will suck big time and you won't be able to play like that...from my own testing anyway.
---
But either way your work will be able to tell you're connected to something for long periods of time, and if they have the software that allows them to actually view your screen in real time without you knowing..(oh yeah..it's a thing hehe), then they'll know something's up.
---
Real talk, never even thought about shift spacebar.  Fuck.
---
hah, well it's like when he made the "special editions" of original movies - Greedo shooting first etc - basically messing things up while thinking he was improving things. :)
---
I'd like to point something out. I have played in high-end guilds through out all my years of Vanilla (retail and private) and the only reason I have elemental shamans and s-priests on the sheet is because they are excellent backup healers, thus making the specc a viable specc. Cats, believe or not are outstanding when played by the right person and bear tanks are greatly underestimated. None of these are any vital key speccs, any raids can do without.  
---
Speccs which are NOT viable:  
---
Moonkin - while they theoretically are good backup healers, the DPS provided is just way too low compared to both elemental shaman and s-priests.  
---
Enhancement shaman - horrible DPS and lack any stats for backup healing.  
---
Ret paladin - Same.  
---
Prot paladin - Not a very good choice of tank.   
---
Arcane mages - horrible DPS.  
---
Am I missing any speccs?  
---
I'm sure the speccs above is possible to play in a raid, but it's like some has said throughout the thread - it's dead meat. I know some will dislike me saying this but I'd never waste loot on dead meat, which is what the general issue would be at the end of the day.
---
I guess I should specify that it was on Nost not back in 04. 
---
i dont watch twitch my dude. its a drop in the bucket to who plays games. stop being so naively cynical. 
---
Just become the boss, then people have to knock before you let them into your office lol.
---
Ye but what software did you use for this remote connection ?
---
Splashtop
---
Fireball has a DoT.  Frost puts a debuff on things not immune to chill effects.
---
Is AM a debuff?  I'll have to check.  I was only playing around with it in one instance run.
---
Like I said.  The only sure way that you will never get caught is to use non-work equipment and non-work network.
---
Thanks, will try this out.
---
Better question. Who remembers ironforge?
---
There are a few in the App Store. I think Google makes one that works with chrome. There is also a MS one called RD Client. 
---
Thanks, ive tried only team viewer and picture of my pc dissapear when i open any game
---
Most big streamers are saying they'll be on a PvE server. That may change though, I just don't see these big PvP streamers not wanting the world PvP aspect of Classic. 
---
Ok cool. And what is the OSRS path?
---
So I pretty much landed on Druid for what class to main in Classic. Out of all the healers, its the most versatile and thus most fun imo. Also the one I've played most in my WoW career. I love being able to tank while I level, and beyond. I'm committed to [this spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxMGscbzZVEcoxa) as I find it most versatile while still being able to remain competitive, healing-wise.
---
But here's the deal: I'm going Alliance and... well, I'm going [male](https://imgur.com/a/jNLH7Hl) Night Elf. Am I going to regret this? I'm just so tired of the female Nelf aesthetic and movement/casting. 
---
Yup. I was sucked right back into the world the second I had to worry about what I pulled, had to look around, had professions that mattered. Then I was full addicted again as soon as I hit Ashenvale and had to have my head on a swivel looking for enemy players. It's the world and gameplay systems that make it a great MMO. Those never get old. Finishing a zone never feels old, especially when you have to fight for it. 
---
Raiding also never gets old because the drops mean so much. When you get something like Ashkandi you do hipthrusts, because you know you are going to crush people for a year.
---
You're not the only one
---
Amazing*
---
Yeah! Gotta have them circles under us!
---
Rogue 
---
Moving correctly will give me carpal tunnel syndrome, weak gold farming, weak ability to win PVP if they get the jump. 
---
must have had a beefy PC to pull that many
---
So i could use MS or google one to stream it on my working laptop ?
---
I want vanilla as it was.
---
Parsec streams your home pc so you can play games from anywhere. You just install it on your pc then install the app on your latop, tablet/phone or whatever and you can directly connect to it.
---
I think you have to make sure it‚Äôs in windowed mode. 
---
Thanks!
---
Thats why it recommended to actually have the very firs character warrior or rogue and not a farming class feeding your melee.
---
By being 60 early, you can get into a guild and run dungeons within the guild. That way the dedicated MTs and OTs will grind the dungeons with their dedicated furies and you will be able to farm your DPS gear as fury. 
---
Come 4months late to the party and you will have to farm your DPS gear in pugs. No problem for somebody willing to tank, a huge obstacle for a mostly fury warrior.
---
Technically there is nothing fundamentally wrong, but:
---
It does not scale well with SPD that well.
---
Has no crit bonus talents like ignite/shatter/ice shards.
---
There are no talents which boost it besides Improved arcane missiles when there are tons for frostbolt or fireball.
---
It has pretty much not the best damage per mana ratio. 
---
It's real use is when you need to finish something quickly, like you don't have the time left to cast frost/firebolt for full 2,5/3 seconds, but you need that piece of damage on a ranged target RIGHT HERE AND NOW before it runs away and pulls next pack. Also in some patches LoS/distance did not break Arcane missiles so it was quite a nice tool for PvP. But that's pretty much it besides other niche uses like arcane vulnerability in BWL.
---
Depends on your companies policies. My computer ya blocks almost everything and I have to submit a ticket to unblock a website or app. 
---
I hope they do at least one RP server, I dont RP but those servers seem way more chill than others
---
Swifty became popular because of pvp. I think he‚Äôll be fine.
---
It may not but I do remember it doing so. But beyond that. It also doesn't scale like frost and fire and Clearcast only effects the first cast not every missile. 
---
BRE is the sole exception. That sword will carry you well into BWL and even AQ40 if you dont get the best loot.
---
With 3 stacks up, its 95dps right there.
---
Clearcast is free mana cost, so it affects the whole thing.
---
Unless you're talking about chance to proc, in which case it is "when you deal damage" and not "when you cast".  (If the tooltip is wrong, and it is when you cast, then it is being applied as the tooltip states on the private server I'm on).
---
I like using R/F/V for warrior stances.
---
Politely asking four newbies in Goldshire to click this creepy stone pedestal to make something ‚Äúneat‚Äù happen. 
---
As a paladin main in vanilla I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll end with a stalemate when the paladin bubble hearths. 
---
The DPM is off-set by how much you get out of clearcasting.
---
Especially since you get 5 seconds of spirit regen when clearcasting procs (5 seconds from when you last spent mana on the cast that procced it, and 5 seconds of spirit regen on that cast).
---
I honestly cant remember an instance in vanilla wow of getting camp killed more than 3 times in a row. 
---
On private servers with a "mafia" I got camp killed for hours.
---
I remember one tank being 4/5 T2.5 first raid ID on one pserver, only gloves he got the AQ40 tank ones. 
---
Seriously brutal gear. But whatever helps increasing that sweet TPS for horde.
---
I just about choked on my coffee. Thanks. I hate it.
---
Clearcast will only proc off the first missile of AM. It was changed prior to launch. So yes the CC will make the whole channel free it only has 1 chance to prior for every complete channel.
---
Not to mention showing up to raids consistently for 2 years, 3 times a week. People underestimate how (real) life can make you stop playing wow within a day. Elite guilds were always recruiting, because fully geared players stop playing. 
---
I personally remember quitting my raid guild in vanilla when my HS final exams were around the corner. In the middle of Naxx I stopped playing from one day to the next. 
---
Then during university I got into hardcore raiding again, only to drop out eventually, due to exams not allowing for me to play that much. 
---
50% clearcast proc is wrong because it counts as a single spell, not 5 spells.  Even then it‚Äôd be closer to 40% because math.  If you experience that proc rate, that‚Äôs private server fuckery and I guarantee it won‚Äôt make it into classic.
---
The damage is decent compared to frostbolt and fireball until you get +dmg then it starts to fall behind at &gt;100 spell power.  Even without spellpower it is mana hungry and difficult to spam without drinking constantly.
---
Back before the talent rehaul for mages, arcane missles had a niche because it had good threat reduction and frost/fire had none.  During the rehaul they took that away from arcane and made the spell really just undesirable.
---
I ran some excel sheets on the spell and it‚Äôs sadly mathematically inferior.  But if you want to knowingly invest in an inferior spell, it‚Äôs your character play how you want.  There are weird advantages like synergy with shadow damage lock (curse of shadows).  
---
I think it‚Äôs funny how some classic enthusiasts said they wanted old graphics because it would take more time to develop the game if they added new graphics. It‚Äôs funny they don‚Äôt reverse their positions now they we know the reverse is true. 
---
Not unless there are confirmed illegal services that may force the local government into action. Which is hard to proof after so many Private servers were wiped here before. So normally a private server have to sell/spread Blizzard's IP as it's own - and no private server does that anymore. People got careful. (same stuff in US; servers usually are shutting down due to cease and desist letters to avoid risks)  
---
We also talking about Russian Government which is slow enough in taking action. And there are enough neighboring countries to move the server to.  
---
So it is possible and it already happened. But it will cost more money and the particular server should go overboard (and obviously be popular) to have enough reasons/value.
---
This is what we want. What do you mean gross? I hate the new character models. Mostly the Tauren one. Tauren used to be huge. Now they look like they barely break six feet. 
---
Azuresong Mageblade. I saved all my DKP to get that. I was so happy I cried. 
---
Men who play male characters are open gays.
---
Same here, I think the animations were better too.
---
I mean gross as in they were unpleasant to look at. Also tauren were still huge. I played one and still couldn‚Äôt fit through all of the same small doorways.
---
I tagged auto-run to ` (to the left of 1, the non-shift version of ~).  Always found it to be close enough where it's convenient, but far enough away that I'm not accidentally hitting it.
---
This might be a hot take, but Arcane Missiles absolutely has its place in your rotation as a mage and here is why.
---
**Arcane Missiles is a channeled spell**, meaning it takes mana up front immediately (as opposed to if it were fully cast).  This also means that in order to get your mana's worth out of the spell, you have to make sure the channel doesn't get interrupted or spell-pushed (getting auto attacked or w/e during cast).
---
Following that, **Arcane Missiles causes multiple instances of damage over a couple seconds**.  This also means that when the spell says it will do, "X damage over Y seconds," any Spell-Power modifier will apply to the total amount of damage done over the time of cast, NOT every tick of damage you do (which means that technically spell power is *kinda* worse for Arcane Missiles than say Fireball/Frostbolt).
---
**Arcane Missiles is mana intensive** (i.e. not as mana efficient as Fireball/Frostbolt), but it also does a lot of damage in a short amount of time.
---
**Arcane Missiles is the best spell in the game because look at my little shards of Arcane look at them go, holy shit you died, how neat is that, that's pretty neat**
---
First of all, Arcane Missiles is solid in PvP for a couple small reasons:  It's technically instant-cast, you don't have to worry about targets not being in front of you as Arcane Missiles is channeled and will follow the target, and it does a lot of burst damage which is really nice for PvP.
---
==Now onto the real shtick==
---
During levelling you really shouldn't worry about using it until you get Arcane Concentration.  Doesn't matter if you're Fire or Frost, you should really get this talent.  This is important because Arcane Concentration says:
---
&gt;Gives you a 10% chance of entering a Clearcasting state after any damage spell hits a target.
---
Clearcasting means that your next spell costs 0 mana.  So here is where Arcane Missiles gets really good.  Say you're a fire mage and you're casting fireballs and fireblasts and pyroblasts (cus you're a fucking big boye), and during your normal rotation Clearcasting procs.  Don't cast fireball, don't cast pyroblast, don't case fireblast - **cast Arcane Missiles**.  Arcane Missiles costs a shitton of mana but does a shitton of damage (as said before).  No it's not as mana efficient, but now it's free.  I said above that Arcane Missiles does multiple instances of damage - in fact it does 5 instances of damage.  This means your damaging spell hits the target 5 times, giving you a 50% chance to proc clear casting. 
---
I should note:  This is in my experience having levelled Mage as both fire and frost and elemental, did a fair amount of wpvp, Raided through AQ40.  I don't claim to be a pro, I just loved mage and tried to be the best I could.
---
There will be a few "Lehroy" type Paladins but what will be REALLY popular will be Game of Thrones names, "Jonsnuh", "Jornsno" for male human warriors "Danyyy", "Danyris" for either female humans or female night elves "Tyrron", "Tirionn" for male gnomes e.t.c.
---
Since Classic is coming it out during the summer it will either come out shortly before, after or during the release of season 9. It will be the Lord of the Rings craze all over again.
---
Its really no more trouble than adding the wow.exe as an external game to steam

 **"I'm a Teepee! I'm a Wigwam! I'm a Teepee! I'm a Wigwam! I'm a Teepee! I'm a Wigwam!"**

---
The "streamer server" will serve as a containment zone for the "problematic demographic", thanks to the streamers attracting their main target group. 
---
Im very grateful to them.
---
I think the gist of it is that it will be a modern take on the old graphics. So they're using the modern engine but grafting old data into it including models, textures, and lighting.
---
[This page](https://www.wowhead.com/news=288407.9/blizzcon-2018-restoring-history-creating-wow-classic-panel) has a big summary of all the information from BlizzCon. For example, from the big blue post:
---
&gt;**Classic Models and Animations**
---
&gt;We‚Äôve also fully restored the models‚Äô classic appearance, but as we worked to restore these, we found some models were broken. In some cases, textures were missing and we had to do some research to find out just how those items should appear and correct them within the system.
---
&gt; The original animations have also been restored, but WoW‚Äôs animation system is tightly coupled with its gameplay code. We had to make changes to both data and code to get the animations back to the 1.12 look. We ran into a few bugs along the way, such as models that should appear prone instead appearing upright, but we were able to correct these with a few fixes.
---
You are wrong about clearcasting with arcane missiles. 
---
The proc happens when you cast a spell, not when you deal damage. Otherwise AoE spells would have a huge chance to proc all the time.
---
This is bugged on some private servers so it happens as you described, but in Classic it will almost definitely work as it did back in Vanilla retail.
---
it was changed for AM in 1.9 
---
&gt;Will now be able to trigger procs based on dealing damage.
---
I thought that too.
---
Kek
---
It's 5 hits.  The talent is when you deal damage, not when you cast.  At least, that's what the tooltip says, and that's how it works on the private server I'm on.
---
Naw man, they were beautiful compared to the models and animations in retail today.
---
I'm glad someone else realizes that it's 5 instances of damaging the target, and that clearcasting procs when you deal damage.
---
Everyone else is ripping into me that it's only 1 spell cast, but that's not what clearcasting procs on.
---
#Oh don't get me started on color blind options. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LhbxdZVxzI0xRVo
---
I disagree. That‚Äôs literally the only thing retail has over classic is visuals. Other than that classic is superior.
---
Not in the slightest, it is a great build that works out really well with little to no down time.
---
I actually have the same memories. I took me 6 months to get my hunter to 60 in Classic because I'd spend 30% of the time chatting with people in Goldshire on Scarlet Crusade. 
---
Met some great people in that little town. 
---
Don't forget to hide auto hide the taskbar. :P
---
1. DPS warrior is in very high demand. That being said Warrior is the most hard core class. It has by far the most dedicated base that will farm 50k gold just to boost dps by .5%. So they are in high demand but competition is fierce. Unless you are planning to dedicate your life to wow. You are not going to be a T1 warrior. You will be relegated to a B tier guild. Would not matter to me but if that stuff means a lot to you. It's something to consider.
---
2. 2 handed fury is viable through out the whole expansion. If you are willing to wield either NightFall (https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169) or BoneReavers' Edge (https://classicdb.ch/?item=17076) Either of those weapons plus hamstring spam is a top tier raid style.
---
3. As a warrior farming sucks unless you are god gear. Then it's just kinda slow. If you wanna make money as a warrior. You should go Rhonin and sell your services as a tank. Some people will whine at you but those people are pathetic and lazy. They haven't played a warrior and can feel free to roll one if they want a free tank. I know you said tanking ain't your thing but it is the best way to make money.
---
I have found the best way to do it. Is to put  in party finding channel that you are starting a (res) run. This is a type of run where every one who goes wants a specific item. You make the group telling everyone who is reserving what if it drops and let them know you are taking all the gravy. All of it again if they whine they can level a warrior or screw off. The gravy in this case is all the trash to DE.
---
"Hey click on this summoning portal, please!" As newb after newb is teleported to Darnassus. 
---
Thanks.  
---
Did this on my shaman when I hit 30. Windfury destroyed the opposition. Funnest bg experience I remember 
---
Its an underrated good spell. I have heard that mobs have arcane resists more often than other resists but never looked into it.
---
I believe it was only through the custom /me emote right?
---
Then you could type anything like:
---
/me dude you suck rofl
---
Don‚Äôt worry. Classic and vanilla UIs will not be that similar. Played in the demo and on a pserver. The demo, for example, had auto-loot.
---
That said yeah, most of that stuff used to have an addon. However old vanilla addos won‚Äôt work with Classic since apparently the vanilla API was _very_ liberal, which is how farming bots were created. Most likely people will redo them.
---
If RNG (Regarding clearcasts) was good in vanilla, then enh shamans would have been a competetive spec, but they are not. 
---
If you think that 10% per missile gives you a 50% chance to make your next spell free, then you need to revise your school math course. 
---
If you summoned people outside the "fatigue border" out in the sea they would take the fatigue damage instantly and die before they were even finished with the loading screen. Had some laughs with that bug.
---
If they tweak paladin to make it an effective tank you'll end up with more people going alliance as they'll have more tanks available and therefore easier time finding groups. So faction balance will get screwed. 
---
Unless they also tweak shammies and make them tanks. 
---
Any exposure is good exposure. If someone wants to play a single player game they‚Äôll play it. I guarantee the amount of games streamers have sold greatly outweighs the amount they have prevented from being sold by a significant margin. 
---
Thanks for citing the patch. Here's a link to the [patch notes](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0) so anyone can quickly Ctrl-F and find it. I was also curious enough to ctrl f for arcane missiles on all subsequent vanilla patch notes to confirm that there is no mention of this change being reverted.
---
Did people really watch Method streams to get info on boss stats back in vanilla? 
---
You probably mean ‚Äùspell‚Äù. And that happens easily on phones. If you didnt know.
---
Shaman T3, Mage T3, Priest T3
---
T2.5 all sucks
---
Pally T2, Rogue T2, Druid T2
---
Warrior T1
---
I was watching a Classic Cast and one of them mentioned playing on a pvp server and just trying to get ahead of everyone else to prevent ganking. Not sure how that‚Äôs going to work out. 
---
Curious why the combos aren‚Äôt mining/eng and tailor/herb? 
---
Warlocks in t1 looks amazing 
---
Quest helper being standard is not pure UI
---
I'll be looking for a bit more of a 'howto' to read about what I'd have to do to get it going so if you're aware of a resource like that I'm all ears (*eyes?*)
---
Yup. They were IRL brothers.
---
I remember &lt;Forlorn&gt;!
---
I remember doing this. So much wonder and excitement. 
---
The demo was also very much a work-in-progress.  They said as much, and they were getting feedback from it as to what felt wrong.
---
That depends, in British English(which i speak) turtles are tortoises are fundamentally different the similarity they have is their order, but not species.
---
1 2 3 4 5 Q E F C V B ‚Äò ... Then my second bar has all these same buttons but + shift. Then there‚Äôs F1-F4 for utillity spells and F5 for /follow macro. Everything else I click or skip.
---
Also I bind the same kind of spells to the same buttons on alts. For example, on a lock I have Fear on F. On a mage Sheep will be on F. Etc. I never pay respects so F is a great key to use for other things.
---
I love my Tauren and his crazy shoulders. I will say though, one of the most annoying things about being a Tauren is that any other race can ride down that WSG tunnel. Get like half way down it and dismount. Meanwhile on my Tauren I gotta dismount on the doorway. Can't tell you how many little Gnome rascals escaped my warrior in that manner. 
---
All that being said I love the old graphics and will choose to play as close to them as I can. I really like the old art style and it is the one part of classic I think my love of is actually just nostalgia lol.
---
I was 24.  Phish was about to break up and I had nothing going on so I started playing WoW.  Orc Rogue but mostly played a 29 rogue twink on Blood Furnace.  Graduated college about 9 months prior.  Played a bunch of golf and drank a bunch of beer 
---
Now.  Retired from my old company with a sweet buyout.  Started a software firm and sold it about 8 months ago.  Again, not much to do.  Married with 3 little kids. Planning to gold farm on a main enough to fund a twink again.  
---
1.  You can't get meditation early on without going arcane.  That's only true of high level.
---
2.  I was doing rough math.  You get the point - much higher chance of clearcasting.
---
It started off that way.
---
I know exactly what you mean. With all of the clipping in WoW you think they‚Äôd let us clip through doorways to help a tauren out, but nope!
---
I agree the old visuals are nostalgic, but the new ones still look nicer to me.
---
That‚Äôs my kick/pummel if I‚Äôm playing melee. Easy and quick when you gotta interrupt a chaos bolt 
---
Well you don't get magic weapons when you kill a boar with a spell in real world. Or pretty much anything that happens in a WoW wouldn't happen in a real world. 
---
Druid
---
Play the game how you want, just don't force people to play it your way.
---
I've played dozens of P servers and retail Vanilla and the last thing I wanna do is search for the quests again.
---
Honestly it's not like I can argue with you. As sexy as I think my potato is with his mega shoulders. Objectively he ugly.
---
I use one called parsec while I'm on work trips and that works just fine, but I'm no IT type so maybe what im referring to as remote desktop actually means something else 
---
facts young Karl facts. Classic wow will destroy Retail. As a casual their is no place for me in retail. Classic though I am so excited for this I am about to shit my pants lol.
---
Honestly I am sure plenty of streamers will have a second guy on a pvp server. I just can't see playing on a pvp server as tenable for a streamer. Unless his plan is to be permanently surrounded by a praetorian guard.
---
Just read the post.
---
It's just his lawyer talk, he seems to of made a habit of his previous job
---
I started playing retail in Cataclysm.  Stopped for awhile and came back in the tail end of Legion.  Played through the release of BfA until I hit the daily WQ grind and stopped because it got boring.
---
 I heard about vanilla WoW servers out in the wild and created an account to check it out because I'd never played.  The experience, while VERY FRUSTRATING TO A NEW PLAYER, has also been much more satisfying.
---
The only plugins I use are mainly UI tweaks and a clock plugin so I don't stay up too late playing.  I've had a blast just ... wandering, questing, and killing stuff.  Having to WORK to level a toon. Grouping with people just to get through open-world content.  It's awesome.
---
So I agree with all your points above.  The world is a LOT bigger in Vanilla because it forces you to slow down and appreciate what you're seeing.  
---
Love it. Make old models great again!
---
True though i have my doubts they will get rid of all UI improvements. Excluding quests visible on the map, that is one area where i don‚Äôt mind change.
---
Don't get it. 
---
Not sure that would be helpful until you get the hour long party buffs 
---
You had it right the first time. 
---
Mining
---
I mean... All cows are female
---
Good for you, me2. I was talking about the market as a whole. 
---
yes, there are guilds that require their raiders to have engineering and certain items made by it.
---
Every time i would get to a new level brack 10, 20, 30 etc i would head back to goldshire and take a break from leveling. Often i would duel and chat with people but usually there would be a train of people trying to jump there way on top of the inn or the blacksmith. If there‚Äôs one achievement im proud of from back in vanilla it‚Äôs mastering how to get on top of the inn. 
---
I just want my old vanilla server back. 
---
Great low leveling pvp area. Doomguards being summoned. Horde coming for dmf.
---
Devs != Community Managers.
---
If anything, CMs would fall under services.
---
Blizzard is staffing up whatever they are permited to staff up.
---
&gt; Met some great people in that little town.
---
I wonder when you played o.o;
---
Do you remember the whole Sinful/Lest stuff, or Nydelana's crusades against the ERP'ers when they eventually cropped up? xD
---
After runescape 3.0 came out, which is an entirely different game. they also added new content to the older runescape and some people still love more content in the og vs the new new game
---
As far as I can tell, Parsec is game streaming and it basically streams the video feed of your game to the device you're using remotely.  
---
See the problem with remote desktop software like RDP, Teamviewer, Logmein, Bomgar...etc..is that they can't handle the video translation.
---
Now Parsec seems to get past this by video streaming from cloud...but this will cause huge bandwidth usage on a work network and probably get you busted just as easily as watching Youtube or something...unless you use non-work equipment on a non-work network...but at that point, you might as well just play on that equipment directly instead of remotely.
---
i play with headphones over one ear so i can be connected with surrounding if so needed. and thous can use my mic sparsely.
---
I am not wrong.  While the spell text of Arcane Missiles says that it does X damage over Y seconds, the each tick of Arcane Missiles has a chance to miss or be resisted or what-have-you.  That means each tick of Arcane Missiles has a chance to hit, which means that each time it hits, it counts as a..
---
&gt; damaging spell hit[ting] a target
---
Another question for experienced warrior raiders. 
---
How useful is cleave in a raid setting? Are there any given moments in raids where it's more beneficial to be using a 2H? 
---
Lets focus real hard on "but classic was my childhood" lol. Go summer internship don't be a child and punt tomorrow for today. That being said unless the internship is wild crazy. You can still be a raider. All you have to do is pick a class that isn't hardcore. I recommend mage. Your quality of life is amazing and you don't need to play 1/10th as much as a warrior to make it work.
---
That is hilariously horrific.
---
Yea, each tick has a chance to miss/be resisted, which means each tick has a chance to hit.  If it has a chance to hit, it is an instance of dealing damage.  It has separate hits, hence it has separate instances, hence the procs!  WHICH IS WHY ARCANE MISSILES IS SO MUCH FUN!!!!

Mid Vanilla to the final patch of BC, moved to Mug'thol after that. 
---
Sinful sounds super familiar. I remember there was a bunch of drama between this guy named Blooddwarf and some girl in Goldshire and GM's had to end up getting involved. 
---
Memory is a bit hazy of details though since this was over 10 years ago. 
---
Not my fault that people tend to use the crappy predicter.
---
I remember the TBC stat stacking bug. I had the +5ft fireblast range gloves. I turned up my view distance and stacked the gloves, doing 1mil+ damage on fireblast for people anywhere on the Sunwell Island.
---
It was a joke.
---
Guess it wasn't a NE rogue then
---
One of my favorite memories was being mind control by a high level priest and having them jump me to the top of the blacksmith. Didnt know it was possible. 
---
I remember trying to master getting from the flume to the edge of the roof for hours! 
---
Yeah I understand what you're saying for sure. What I do is I use a (very old) personal laptop that I keep at work, then remote into my home gaming desktop through parsec using either my work's guest network or tethering from my phone, whichever works better at the time, sometimes my works guest network is a little slower. The main reason I do this is because like I said, the laptop I'm using is quite old and by using parsec I can play at the same level of graphics that I can on my home PC. Also, its  really nice not having to download a new game every time I get one, or make UI changes on 2 different machines.

I'll be levelling the lock first even though the rogue will be my main. The rogue will level on double xp and once  she has 300 engineering and I've crafted goggles, I won't be making anything other than explosives so won't need much ore. I'll need a steady stream of herbs for reagents so would prefer to farm them on my main especially as that will be the one with epic riding. I think that's why at least, there might have been more to it but I can't remember!
---
Heh I was thinking warlock
---
5 rolls of 1/10 does not mean you'll have get a clear casting proc 50% of the time.  
---
There are 5 independent 10% rolls.  That means there are 6 total scenarios and five of which  leave with a clear casting proc (1 roll hits, 2 rolls hit, 3 rolls hit, 4 rolls hit, or 5 rolls hit).  One scenario leaves you without a clear casting proc:  0 rolls hit.  The math on that is .9\^5 \~ 59.1%.  That means that clear casting wont proc almost 60% of the time.  Clear casting will proc only 40.9% of the time which is much lower than 50% if you're trying to theory craft it.

Crumbs that's some serious retraining that would be needed!

Does anyone remember the bug as a mage where you could blink through the VC instance and not actually phase into the instance? You‚Äôd run through into what looked kind of like a ‚Äòtest‚Äô for Outland with floating rocks and waterfalls.

Pally T2

Warrior T3

Are my top three.

We don't even know when Classic will launch...maybe after August...who knows.
---
Imp overpower is an interesting approach actually.  I feel like actually hitting your attacks is better than spamming overpower but its interesting for sure. The issue I see is you aremt really able to hamstring kite as well and end up taking more dmg but that might be a non issue if you farm low level mobs.
---
It still does not outweigh the profits you get from fire/frost spells as your baseline ability. 
---
It's not like Arcane missiles is a terribly bad spell or something, it has it's own uses - it is just not as good as other ones when it comes to raw damage output over time.

Gaming should never usurp family or work obligations- you have to provide for yourself and your well-being first.  Then by all means game responsibly =P

The clue is in the name ;)
---
Wow, yeah you're right.  Shit.  My math brain is kinda retarded lol.
---
The only thing to consider with a warlock. Is that they are more HC then mages. They require more gear to make work and are easily ganked while leveling. They are a great class but not as casual as a mage. That being said I think Mage is the most casual class that can be played into a T1 hardcore class at anytime. If your scheduale should open up. Warlck is a good choice too though.
---
Wrath baby here and played a Nelf hunter so I want to relive that nostalgia but I've heard mixed thoughts. I tried hunter on a "server" and it was interesting but I'm unsure if it meets my criteria for end game. Another class fantasy I really enjoy is rogue and am leaning towards that. 
---
My main goal is PvP - Primarily Battlegrounds (prefer premade) and semi-hardcore raiding. I tend to prefer dps classes overall and like the idea of doing damage.
---
In general, I prefer a decently robust rotation (I know classic isn't known for this but I would rather not spam one button unless the class becomes more complex in later)
---
Preferably high skill cap or at least a class that has a lot of outplaying potential with a rewarding learning skill curve.
---
Useful at all or at least most of vanilla (particularly endgame, I know all classes and specs are viable but would prefer to not be a class that is very underrepresented in raids/bgs) 
---
Decent gold farming is a nice plus, not exactly required
---
Planning on playing alliance most likely (although if someone wants to make a case for horde by all means) and would like to what sort of role I would be expected to fulfill in raids, premade bgs and what racials (I care a decent amount about racials but aesthetics are always nice) and professions to min-max.
---
Sorry about the long post.
---
You don‚Äôt need a job, you can stream classic on twitch and ask for donations 
---
yep
---
Your common sense is hilariously broken.
---
The ‚Äúinfinite growth‚Äù argument needs a subject matter that is growing. Classic‚Äôs not even out yet. We don‚Äôt even _know_ if it will grow beyond the initial player base. 
---
Your common sense is a speculation.
---
Changes ruined the game and gamplay. people can play retail if there like changes no need to modify classic...
---
So... on a personal level, I hope the try to fix any and all things that were clearly bugs when they release classic. Also, since we know they are using the updated engine, a lot of things that depending on collision and elevation and weird things like that probably wont work. On the other hand... because they bringing over classic maps into the modern engine, you can bet your ass people will end up finding new and weird places to "accidently" end up in.
---
if i remember right, i would just run up some hills in duskwood and then just jump down into Zg. its a chill place when there are no trolls trying to kill you :P Ps: acctualy found a video about it on youtube 
---
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg9-LAmZUiU
---
Thanks. Ok that makes sense. I would like that.
---
I would play a druid tank and just tank dungeons that have green mobs all the way to 60. I would start with RFC at lvl 18, WC at 22 SFK at 25 etc. All my money would go to health potions/gear upgrades (fuck a mount lol) and I would make sure that every healer I group with knows wtf they are doing before grouping with them. 
---
Oh dear god I didn't think effects like that would stack too. I did have one special element to my duping though, because I conveniently had a BoE 1h sword with +defense on it when I copied my Mage. I included that one in the stat dupe, and became nigh-impossible to hit. Based on how fights between melee stat dupers went, not many seemed to realise just how broken defense stacking was.
---
No, because despite the good they have given us, they are all still parasites that exist to make money off our nostalgia. Except *debatably* one of them.
---
Blizzard is much better off not acknowledging them, and you're better off not associating with them once classic comes out. Assuming classic is up to expectations, of course.
---
Be aware that you will be expected to tank in dungeon (unless you manage to get a feral druid friend). Warrior (and paladins) tanks will likely not bring you because they will want the plate and weapon for themselves. Only druids tank will accept you because they don't care about plate and weapons. 
---
Quick question, with that build, you're not going to deep wounds or impale, and rend is worse damage per rage than heroic strike at all points in the game, so why not just put the 2 imp rend points into deflection?
---
a glass of water in your house is just a glass of water.

a glass of water after wandering the desert is heaven.

every inconvenience and hassle of vanilla serves as a contrast and enhances every positive in the game.
---
I tried it recently macro wouldnt work. Not sure if this is private server shenanigans..
---
All i managed was pet attack + autoshot.  
---
Ended up being not so bad cause u dont need to hunter mark every mob anyway
---
What should I level first? My 2 classes will be warrior and warlock. I want to raid and possibly PvP some. 
---
This looks like you are college janitor, solving some kind of impossible math equation left on the chalk board.

Get a 12 button mouse. With shift and ctrl modifiers, that's potentially 36 keybinds on your mouse alone.

Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit. However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
This is from archived reckoning guide written during patch 1.10 in May 2006.  I started playing Paladin on TBC launch, and I can confirm reckoning did not generate charges on sitting.  There is nothing in 1.11 or 1.12 patch notes to indicate any reck changes.  
---
If you have any original vanilla videos showing reckoning gained from sitting, I would really like to see a link.   
---
I mean, you could play after work like the rest of us old farts?
---
But yeah, get the damn internship. Wow can wait (after work).
---
It's going to be 1.12, there will be tons of hit gear, but if you are horde feel free to go with brd axe or reaper. 
---
Also the only real way to get your pre raid bis is to tank or to become bff with a feral tank.
---
"your nostalgia" hey assclown, there is no classic without private servers.

So from the moment a spell successfully lands your mana regen takes a hit.  There are two states, which can be described inside and outside of the 5 second rule.  So lets say combat begins and your first HTrank4 lands, you are now inside the 5 second rule meaning you have a reduced rate of mana regen as opposed to the mana regen rate you had before the spell landed.   If you continue to land spells within 5 second intervals you would remain in the reduced mana regen state, why chain casting is so bad on mana is not only the mana it expends but the fact you don't enter whats considered outside the 5 second rule where your mana would regen at an increased rate.  So lets say you wait 5 seconds, after landing a spell your regen immediately adjusts to the higher regen rate this is being outside of the 5 second rule or there being.  You should shoot to be outside of the 5 second rule as much as possible because it nets you more mana.   
---
The downside of that is obvious if I'm not casting I'm not helping this is where you use cancel cast to your benefit.  Because you remember as I said you only enter inside the 5 second rule when you land the spell not when you begin to cast a spell.    A cancel cast is just as it sounds cancelling a spell that is currently being casted, popular methods are a spacebar tap to jump, 1 step forward, 1 step backward, strafe left,  strafe right, basically any movement while you are casting the spell.  I generally use 1 step forward and 1 step backward in kind of rotation you want to maintain your position if your in the right position being mindfull that in instance content you will be moving as needed anyway.   
---
So where cancel cast and outside 5 second combine cancelling heals that are really not needed, or heals you got sniped on, maintains the time that you are in the preferential mana regen state or outside of the 5 second rule.   This keeps you in an extremely mana efficient state and will reduce your overheal percentage.  Saving that mana and heal throughput for when its really needed, which in my opinion is what makes a really great healer statistically.
---
So as a general strategy in how I approach my rotation lets just say I had MT heal duty right.  So I would keep rejuvenation up on the tank rejuv will instantly put you inside the 5 second rule the duration of rejuv is 12 seconds so keep that in mind.  I have the MT as my target and I immediately start casting a HealingTouch Rank 4.  One benefit of cancel casting is reducing the time between when the target takes damage and when your heal lands because your essentially always casting just letting in land when it needs to land.  So you start casting on your tank regardless of whether or not they have damage on them or not.  So you got your eyes on the remaining cast time of your spell and the current health percent of your target.  This is where addons help a good UnitFrame addon like X-Perl and a good action bar addon that allows you to color code, put percentage time remaining whatever your personal preference is.  But you can do it without addons they can just help.  So at around 2 seconds you have to make the decision if you want that heal to land or not meaning you need to quickly calculate is it efficient if this heal lands right now.  Has the tank taken any damage, has he taken a small amount of damage that the next of rejuv would replace, has he taken  medium amount of damage.  I'm really only letting my heal land if hes taken damage more then 1 or 2 ticks of rejuv.  I could get to 2 seconds with only a small amount of time before I mean it to land because he has a valid amount of damage on him and then the health bar might spike "sniping" someone else got to him first then I'll cancel 1 step forward or 1 step back.  Every time you cancel, because it was not needed you do not expend that mana, you either get outside of 5 second faster or keep yourself inside 5 second longer depending on whether or not you were in or out to begin with.  Now if your tank takes some spikey ass damage hit your emergency Natures Swiftness Healing Touch then refresh rejuv and start your cancel casting all over again.  That's just a basic there is a ton of other conditional solutions for spike dmg like Swiftmend, and regrowth.    And that is just like a basic keep 1 tank strat you might have more then 1 tank you might have a boss that switches targets and drops agro often.  I got some mad tech using focus frames, and macros where basically I set the boss as my focus and just use a macro to cast heal on focus target while still using cancel cast which can get my heals landed on tanks faster and efficiently even when the boss is switching agro on targets. That's the real advanced shit I would just practice standard cancel casting in 5 mans and then in a raid or something high level youll have that experience. 
---
So say your assigned raid healing not a tank target so raid healing is far more reactive then a a cancel cast rotation on a tank that you have been assigned.  
---
I still use cancel casting while raid healing, probably heavier on rejuvenation during a raid heal assignment, but still a lot of ht rank 4.  I used different methods based on addons and style at the time.  What I experienced and still believe to be true is that if your examining your raid frames and everyone is topped off and all of sudden 3-4 people take a spike of dmg all healers are doing the same thing many who might have preferable latency and just straight up faster reaction times than you and several classes that have faster primary heals like priest paly.  So I tended to search for my response target as the second or third highest health of the lowest health targets.  Meaning all raid members were at 100 percent then 3 casters took a diff amount of damage putting them at 70 percent life 50 percent life and 30 percent life respectively.  I did not go for the 30 percent (unless positioning and location would of made it impossible for another  priest paly to get to them or other unique conditions)  I'd go for the 50 percent more often than not and more than not did my heal land before being sniped.  Of course your always paying attention and cancel casting if you find a reaction target and you do get sniped and his health bar pops back up and thats fine you want that you want to hold on to that mana like it owes you money. 
---
OMG I remember that Tauren Warrior Ugg!!! That guy was decked out in stam gear and was damn near impossible to bring down in WSG LOL. I got ROFLSTOMP by him so many times. Nostalgia overload!
---
‚Ä¶ what's wrong with skirts?
---
I think that is part of the point. Two people do the exact same work, but one of them gets a 12 pc, drink, and fries, while the other guy is stuck with a 4 pc. They each did equal amounts of work, but one guy was randomly more rewarded.
---
So what?
---
That doesn't rly impact you much as a fury warrior, you literally only need the shoulders which drops 2x every raid. 
---
Yes, random lucky bonuses are what this game great...
---
*Wooo* It's your **3rd Cakeday** zelfrax! ^(hug)
---
Agree so much on the dance revolution point.  Somewhere along the line raiding when from some realistic (in a fantasy way) battle to bring down a big monster to Konami.
---
I want all my spells available all the time. When I played as a priest I had Q (shield), E (flash), s-E (heal), R (renew), F (Gheal), s-F (PoH),` (dispel).
---
That allowed for combinations of 1-5,z,x,c,v,g for offensive/misc spells.
---
Even with the possibility to proc clearcasting on each tick of damage there are major problems holding arcane missiles back whether soloing or dungeoneering.
---
While soloing a good rotation that uses arcane missiles would look like this:
---
Frostbolt -&gt; Arcane Missiles -&gt; Fire Blast -&gt; Frost Nova -&gt; Arcane Missiles -&gt; Fire Blast
---
Arcane Missiles shouldn't be used as an opener because it immediately puts an invisible debuff on a mob that aggros it. Frostbolt also slows the mob reducing your damage taken.
---
Fire Blast has much higher DPS that easily offsets its slightly lower DPM, so it should be used often. Also can kite for a global after using, reducing damage taken.
---
So if clearcasting procs from arcane missiles with this rotation a spell other than arcane missiles (with much lower mana cost) would be the one to benefit from clearcasting unless you decide to sacrifice significant DPS or HP by using arcane missiles twice in a row. Arcane Missiles also tends to be wasteful for finishing off mobs due to its long cast time.
---
While doing dungeons using arcane missiles isn't great because it doesn't have a 30% threat reducing talent like frost and fire spells do. You can do about 43% more frost/fire damage before pulling aggro than arcane. Also much like when soloing you often have to choose between losing DPS by not using fire blast or wasting the clearcasting proc on the relatively low mana cost fire blast.
---
Funny thing about classic rotations is that while yes they are easy, have you seen modern wow? Of course, on average they are more complex rotations, but even the simple rotations are screwed up by a lot of players. How many low DPS players have you seen absolutely not know their rotation with all the resources of today? Especially on simpler classes like BM hunters. 
---
No. I think most Classic players won't have previously played on a private server. As time goes on, the percentages will slowly shift towards players that have. 
---
If you are a spellpower focused retribution paladin, there's for example the Sleeping Willow, giving off an aoe dps poison scaling with rank. The Knockdown hammer from Magmadar can also help the group quite a bit, although requires quite a bit more to farm. Silent Fang is an incredibly useful weapon for spellpower focus since it allows you to keep up dps but also silence key targets quite often, the same goes for other weapons like the ones disarming stunning 8 seconds, debuffing etc.
---
A lot of key strengths as ret lies in you being able to use different on hit effects quite efficiently while still dishing out very good dps, especially with a spellpower set scaling up nearly all of your dps output/onhit effects and mana. 
---
Other things that are good are obviously keeping an eye out for Blessing of Protection, potentially offtanking targets with inc holy threat or supplementing heal when your tank is low or your healer has no mana. Ressing targets is always nice if you have a group aiming to be efficient, it saves a lot of mana and time for your healer, especially since you might often be able to stay out of combat while the rests keeps up the pace. 
---
Bombs are to be used often and the engineering charges which scale with spellpower are only on a minute cooldown so use them often, same goes for the Un Goro Crater Crystals ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=11566](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11566)) which scale with spellpower and have a low cooldown. 
---
Basically what the devs give you is a multitude of options you can choose to use if you want. If you just wanna be the dpsing ret, before t2 arrives you should be able to top dps in short dungeon fights, if you do the simple things you do efficiently and keep an eye out for stat efficient items. 
---
You're going to be drinking a lot, so taking hits and then eating isn't bad.
---
Does Arcane not have a 40% threat reduction?  Or was that added in TBC? (I haven't looked into a build with this yet).
---
I didn't pull aggro off the tank in the dungeon I ran, even if I spammed the crap out of AM.
---
I think that's in reference to the current game. No one steamed in vanilla (and Method wasn't a hugely famous guild then either, not even sure when they started) but people absolutely watched videos (mostly Nightmare's Asylum and then Curse, but Nihilum did a few, and tons of other guilds did a few).
---
I shouldn't have to say this, but it's satire. Don't panic lol
---
The water is the only thing I plan on keeping in the original low texture, the glassy texture just look uncanny, and I rather liked the cheesy poor quality water.

I had a dream that they cancelled classic wow. A nightmare.
---
Taurens can also mount in deeper water further without dismounting.
---
Gnomes get dismounted and need to swim even if they hit a puddle (I.e. they have to swim in the shallows of inner Mara and sos)
---
My only real gripe with taurens is they can't ride skeletal undead warhorses.
---
I work from home and citrix into work from my actual home PC. I've been playing wow from it on pservers for quite some time and have never had an issue.
---
Is it possible that they could somehow see what I'm doing on my home PC? I'm guessing not, but am just curious. I do programming, but am not super well versed in these matters.
---
I'm gay and I've always played male characters so I think you're onto something.
---
I found the best use of arcane missiles to be in pvp.  Before it was nerfed, as all awesome abilities eventually are, as long as your target was in range at the start of the cast and you weren't interrupted, he would eat the entire spell.  For example, you're in WSG and a guy with low health rides past you on his mount and you don't have time to finish him off with a fireball.  If you start casting arcane missiles, he can be at the other end of the map by the time you finish the cast and he will take damage from all five volleys.
---
Man, no matter how Classic ends up being... we will never get those moments again.
---
Lol im aware
---
I'm going to seem a bit brash saying this, but hopefully that is what you need to really come to a conclusion.
---
Ditch retail wow and focus on classic. Make a guild there with all your friends and just focus on having a good time.
---
I edited my character models so that my human was a gnome. Completely against tos but was never caught
---
I would love to have my 60 rogue farming alt to get 2 of these if nothing else just for science and the lulz.
---
Aq40 is o e raid where I wish there was a teleport after you killed the twins. Even a port to their room would've been amazing
---
lol that sounds hilarious with gnomes. Been playing classic for 15 years. Never played allied seriously. One time in either TBC or WOTLK. Not sure which but it was around when they dropped faction transfers. I switched my warrior to being ally. The reason was that the new human racial was stupid op. 
---
Point being I logged in drunk as hell thats how I used to pvp. Get into the BG and just scream "Hell yea lets carve up these stupid half men and their knife eared goons!" Instead of the normal response I got crickets. I look around me and go... Oh yea, thats not gonna play here. I try to brush it off and stay pumped. 
---
BG starts I come pouring out of the gate ready to rend people asunder. I get halfway across the map and engage! I die instantly out numbered 10 to 1. What happened  to my team I think? Look at chat, they are in the base arguing about needing more defenders... There are 8 people in the base... This is when I realize these are not my people. I do not know their ways of "defense" I do not know their ways of discipline and restraint... At heart I am horde. We have 100 words for attack. Defense though? We only have one word for that and the only reason we have a word for it at all. Is so we can screech at people performing the offending task. Defense... You must be out of your god damn mind! Point is I wasted 25 more dollars moving him back to horde lol.
---
Most shamans use it to get a free lightning bolt every now and then when auto attacking.
---
Admittedly I think I rather have a weapon that just gives me some sp or spell crit.
---
Okay except you're wrong. Do you know how rare it is to get a 420 from a base 370? Do you know how Titanforging works? It's several rolls when an item drops, not just one. The game does a titanforge roll and if it titanforges it does another with the same chance and so on until it gets a non titanforged roll. So yes to get a 370 item which is LFR up to 420 which is beyond Mythic is quite a stretch. During one of the last Q&amp;As of Legion Blizzard confirmed that if you ran a normal length tier every single week you'd get on average one high titanforged item from normal. To get one from LFR is like hitting the lottery. So please don't insult everyone's intelligence by pretending it's a common thing. I haven't even seen a screenshot of an LFR item hitting the cap since Nighthold. That was what? 2 years ago? 
---
You're not going to trivialize content with a couple piece of nice loot. That's not how it works. Titanforging isn't common enough for that to be a problem. Even in the world first race where they do split farms, funneling loot to the most extreme degree you can in the game, and getting far more TFed items than a normal raid would have, they're still not trivializing the raid. 
---
For the people who make up the huge majority of WoW players, TF is just a nice bonus. For those who are competitive it seemed like a nightmare until reason prevailed and we were able to see that it's not common enough to be an issue. We'll always have the absolute best gear, and TF isn't going to change that. 
---
Oh we will absolutely get people clicking Darnassus ports thinking they're summons or ports to IF. Still works on pservers.
---
Work is overrated. WoW is life. 
---
Jokes aside, take the internship.

It just made the game look and feel like some pos JRPG where everything set off neon fireworks for 11,492,894,774 damage pew pew big numbers and flashing lights are fun, right?
---
Looks so retarded, they just loose all meaning when the values get that high.
---
You have got to be kidding. There‚Äôs no way this is a legit source
---
Ugg was an IRL professional football player. It was so fitting.
---
My friend and I were playing with fury warrior some time in vanilla and realized that (at the time) +healing stacked with bloodthirst, blood craze, and other healing effects so we bought a full set of +healing gear, 2 julies dagger, and 2x lifesteal enchants. The warrior didn't do much damage, but was pretty much unkillable because of the self healing. After dueling for a bit we did some BGs...and it was hotfixed 2 days later.
---
That would have been awesome...
---
Best time ever as a mage and had some proper LOL moments with guildies doing wsg against the top pve Horde guilds on our server.
---
Each team had 2 powerup mages and it was honestly the most fun I've had pvping.
---
When both sides has something OP then it's a level playing field. Especially since our flag carriers were the guild's MT's and were flasked up.
---
Double digits FPS in a raid? Unheard of!
---
Probably don't.
---
HL3 confirmed
---
Not sure yet. I'm a couple months out from actually having enough to put anything down, so I'm not letting myself go to the dealership - the better to prevent rash decisions when I'm looking at all the pretty bikes.
---
I'm planning on something in the 7-900 range, probably a Honda, but we'll see. My brother thinks I ought to go bigger but I think 1k+ is getting into old man bike territory. At that point you may as well get a Goldwing and the free AARP membership that comes with it. :p
---
Other people answered your question. So I am just going to make a suggestion. If you don't plan on getting good gear. Tauren &gt; Orc When you are pvping on a Hybrid class. Getting a free spell off is way more huge then some maybe it will maybe it wont stun resist. The only way I can even argue the stun resist could compare. Is if you got amazing gear so you have enough stamina to not need the health gained from a free heal.
---
Also if you plan of playing a Melee of any type. Your best friend will always be the priest. Dispel magic is the goat in classic wow. It's the most powerful spell in the game and will make your life 100000000000x better.
---
You know its old by the lack of blue dresses everywhere. Nice screenshot :D
---
ITT: no casters *resist*
---
That's right! Looking forward to Huzzah's new video about Hinterlands rares!
---
I agree with this. Focus on what will be a more rewarding and fun experience. You've had a successful guild in retail so you can do the same in classic.
---
Yeah, give credit to the guy who screencapped another guy's funny post!
---
How many other visions of Classic did you have? How many were the authentic Classic we are hoping to get?
---
Yupp. Im sure theres some people who it wont be the same for but theres A LOOOOOOOOOOOT of us who has played a fuckton of hours on private realms and it has been the same. Its genuinly a good and preferable game for us. 
---
Now add the feeling of it being legitimite, that you wont get on private realms, and you have a fucking homerun. 
---
That launch month is gonna be SO fun. Streams on 1 monitor, WoW on 1. 
---
Unless you want to be an ultra-hardcore no-lifer I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it much. I played private and raided at a higher level while having a career than I ever did back in vanilla when I was in high school. It doesn‚Äôt have to be that much of a time sink. 
---
Yeah, I really don't follow the argument here.
---
Fights in mid are a huge waste of time, if your premade is fighting another premade for more than just bragging rights, than youre both doing it wrong.
---
McForged*
---
I recently made a post for it (considering I'm the original founder). You can find it in the wiki here too (https://nm.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/index).
---
It may be taken down, but thanks for sharing at least! :-)
---
Plus spell damage is for the full cast, so it's crap per tick, same with +healing and mend pet.
---
For many rolls of the dice (like calculating mana efficiency for a levelling build) you‚Äôre wrong: it‚Äôs still 1/10 per tick or on average once every other channel. Misses ignored because that affects other spells equally.
---
What you are doing is calculating the chance of NOT proccing clearcasting on a single channel. Which as we know can never be 0%.
---
It gets interesting when you try to factor in that with normal distribution of results in terms of time between proccs, you have a chance to ¬´clip¬ª  and waste them.
---
Certain Streamers already said that they will absolutely play on PvE because playing on PvP Servers would just be stupid due to this camping
---
You should have a tanking set and tank 5mans at least.

Go dual wield once you have say thrash blade plus one similarly strong weapon as well as about +5 hit.

Then in raids don't be too fussy and just take what weapon upgrades you can get as a rule of thumb. Not everyone is going to have that cts/mala and you might raid bwl for months without seeing either drop.

Appreciate it, dispel magic is like a friendly purge. Some yin-yang shit right here.

I also forgot to mention in my previous post. The best way for you to farm gold will be to get yourself a shield with some elemental gear. Then head off to DM East (guides on youtube) and AOE the non-elite packs of plants. You will get Bukuu gold. Herbalism is for suckers.

As for skinning it's a bad job don't waste your time on it at 60 unless you want to get a mate for farming Devilsaur. Do get skinning for while you level though. You will 100% drop it at 60 for a better job but while you level. It's free gold at no extra inconvenience.

As far as professions if you wanna go hard in PVP. You are obv going to need engineering as I'm sure you know. For a second job I would choose either Alchemy for bonus pots, Enchanting because it's self contained. Or and I am shaky on this one I may be bleeding into TBC but I think tailoring might have nets you can root people with too.
